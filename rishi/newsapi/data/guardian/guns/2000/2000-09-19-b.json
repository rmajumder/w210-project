  "<p>It had all the hallmarks of your average job ad - but with one noteworthy difference. Nestling among the higher education classifieds last week was an advertisement offering teachers, healthcare workers and counsellors the chance to do \"something completely different\" - an invitation from the internal security service MI5 to apply to join its spy-recruiting department. James Bond it might not be, but the small print highlighted a crucial qualification for the job: an almost superhuman degree of self-control. \"Please avoid telling your friends about your application,\" it pleaded. \"Discretion is an essential part of working for the security service.\" </p> <p>Working for MI5 - like working for the covert wings of government, policing and the armed forces - may sound thrilling, but there are serious psychological downsides to pursuing a top secret career. </p> <p>\"It was really hard, but it was part of the job and you just had to accept that,\" recalls Oleg Gordievsky, who defected from the KGB to join MI6 in 1985. Even though he never had to sign the Official Secrets Act, he says, he kept his counsel, \"based on my own principles and conscience.\" As a result, even his closest family were kept in the dark on all matters deemed top secret. \"I didn't tell them anything. My children were brought up on the crossroads of the cold war, so they didn't want to know, and my sister never asked because she didn't want to put that pressure on me.\" </p> <p>In a culture in which work plays such a major role in our daily conversations and personal relationships, some psychologists argue that the strain of conducting a cloak-and-dagger career is one more job stress a wearied labour force does not need. </p> <p>\"It does create additional problems because generally you can only talk to people in the same business,\" says Noreen Tehrani, now a psychologist specialising in workplace stress but previously a government researcher who was required to sign the Official Secrets Act. \"There was a time when I couldn't tell anyone what I was doing and it made my social life quite difficult because when I met new people, they'd always ask: 'What do you do?' And I'd have to say: 'I can't really tell you.' I'm in the same situation now as most of my work is confidential and because we talk about work so much, there's an element of, well, what kind of conversations can you have?\" </p> <p>During the 10 years he served in the SAS, Neil Coleman could give no indication to his family when, where or for how long he'd be gone. \"It was stressful,\" he says. \"There were times in my life when nobody knew where I was - and when you went home everything could be hunky-dory or your wife could have left you.\" </p> <p>In a career marked by extreme danger - including helping to end the Iranian embassy siege in 1980 - the strain of not talking about work often manifested itself indirectly in his personal relationships, which suffered as a result. \"The nature of the job and the lack of communication obviously caused pressures with your wife, so in my job there was a high divorce rate.\" He even attributes part of the post-traumatic stress from which he still suffers to that specific job requirement. </p> <p>But there are things to be gained from an embargo on work-oriented coversation, argues Guy Fielding, a lecturer at Oxford University who has researched secrets, lies and interpersonal relationships. \"The flipside of this kind of secrecy is that these people could get some separation between the various aspects of their life,\" he says. \"They have to divide work life from family life and social life, which can give psychological benefit.\" </p> <p>Perhaps it is for this reason that Commander David Perfect had no qualms about being restrained from talking shop with family and friends during his 31-year career in the Royal Navy's submarine service. \"There were lots of times we couldn't talk about the job, but I didn't find it particularly hard. In fairness to the system, it was explained to everyone what you could or could not say, and everybody knew the ground rules. I could say, I'm going away at this time, I'm likely to be back at this time and this is the sort of area I'll be in.\" </p> <p>Navy bases provided an essential support network for his family in his absence, Perfect says. \"There were a lot of wives living together and they all had their own ideas about what we were up to. It didn't really matter whether they were right or wrong - it just helped.\" </p> <p>But by no means everyone who takes a vow of secrecy manages to muster so much self-control - and the consequences can be devastating, as history demonstrates, from the intrigues of Imperial Rome to the Profumo affair and beyond. Gordievsky admits it is a temptation to which even the most cunning of double agents is subject. \"I had a British lady friend and it was difficult not to share the circumstances of my job with someone I was that close to. We talked about her work more, but sometimes I did open up to her, which was a bit against the rules.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, Gordievsky says, the secretiveness imposed by a career in espionage may be equalled by the pressures towards confidentiality of the modern business world. \"It was hard, but sometimes I think it wasn't as hard as some of the pressures people have in business today,\" he says. \"They have obligations to the deals they strike - a lot feel they can't turn to anyone when they think things are wrong or corrupt. Things are hanging over their heads, too.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are nine new productions in English National Opera's Italian Season, its bold and imaginative venture to celebrate both the millennium and the centenary of Verdi's death. Puccini's Manon Lescaut opened the season on Monday, with Monteverdi's The Coronation of Poppea to follow the night after, so the beginning and end of the great Italian lyric tradition were represented from the start. </p> <p>The key to this massive project lies in the design: without a basic set running throughout the series, managing such a number of shows would be logistically impossible. So Stefanos Lazaridis has come up with an all-purpose setting onto which extra elements will be grafted to define each staging. But this is more than some neutral, background idea. Lazaridis's set confronts the audience as soon as they enter the auditorium; made of old scaffolding lashed together, it encloses the stalls with a walkway running the whole circumference of the auditorium at circle level, with ladders to higher platforms where the boxes would otherwise be and similar galleries surrounding the acting area. A spiral stairway leads upwards from the stage into the flies. </p> <p>For the opening show, director Keith Warner has used every level to come up with a wonderfully rich, psychologically penetrating and dramatically effective staging of Manon Lescaut that steadily tightens its focus, just as the opera does, on to the pair of doomed lovers. The galleries are thronged with the chorus in the opening act, observing and commenting upon the burgeoning love between Manon and des Grieux, and they follow her downfall in the second with equal relish. In the third the convicted women embarking on the prison ship to America are paraded around the auditorium on the walkway, derided by the chorus all the time. The distinction between audience and action, already blurred by the portrayal of the old rou\u00e9 Edmondo as a chorus figure, becomes hard to sustain, so that the final act played out between Manon and des Grieux in the wreckage of the set is all the more concentrated. </p> <p>Warner makes telling use of symbolism too. As the prelude is played, a masked figure, representing the corrupt world that will bring Manon's destruction, teases a young girl (Manon herself, presumably) with toys - a horse, a gilded mansion. When she is arrested as a prostitute at the end of the second act, Edmondo brutally stamps upon the house. In the final scene, as the lovers expire in the desert, Manon catches sight of her reflection and sees instead that young girl. They are simple gestures, yet wonderfully effective. The show is full of such careful details, which cumulatively bring this sometimes problematic drama to life. </p> <p>The main challenge is mapping the personality of Manon herself - an innocent virgin in the first act, transformed into a grasping opportunist in the second, yet changed again into a tragic heroine by the end. Nina Stemme manages that progression pretty convincingly, singing better and better as the evening went on. Martin Thompson's des Grieux is sturdily sung too. David Kempster's Lescaut is nicely ambivalent, Mark Richardson's Geronte an irredeemable old lecher, and John Graham-Hall's Edmondo a wonderful Voltairian portrait of total corruption. The chorus are brilliantly marshalled, and Paul Daniel conducts the score with increasing passion and certainty as the opera homes in on its tragic target. A great start to a fascinating autumn at the Coliseum. </p> <p>In rep until November 3. Box office: 020-7632 8300. </p>",
  "<p>What drove Ted Hughes to adapt Alcestis, the Euripides play in which a wife dies in order that her husband may live? The temptation is to see it as a deeply personal work hewn out of Hughes's relationship with Sylvia Plath. But one virtue of Barrie Rutter's premiere production for North ern Broadsides is that it allows us to see the play in larger, more visionary terms. </p> <p>Hughes's version is anything but straight Euripides. He keeps the structure whereby Admetos, the king of Thessaly, accepts his wife's sacrifice of her life for his. He also preserves the magical conclusion in which Heracles resurrects Alcestis. But where Euripides casts his sceptical eye over woman's unequal relationship to man, Hughes makes this a story of struggle and, finally, hope in which death is conquered not just by Heracles but by unswerving love. </p> <p>Hughes heightens the conflict in several ways; one is by sharpening the exchanges between Admetos and his father who refuses to give up his own life. His chief innovation is to make Heracles a pivotal figure who, while sojourning in Admetos's house, re-enacts his 12 labours. My first reaction was that this clogs the narrative, but Hughes's purpose is twofold: to motivate Heracles's act of human resurrection and to show that all existence is a struggle between death and love. </p> <p>This spirit informs Hughes's Birthday Letters; it also lurks behind The Winter's Tale. Hughes is consciously tapping into the great Shakespearean reconciliation-myth as the silent Alcestis is restored to her husband. And Rutter's production plays on those links by having Joanne Thirsk's Alcestis preserve a touching statue-like stillness as she awaits her husband's reclamation. </p> <p>The production has a stark severity - a brick-walled background, shadowy vaults - but given the optimistic ending and the modernity of Hughes's language I wished that the production were lighter in tone. The acting sometimes succumbs to armpit rhetoric and the costumes, making Admetos and his courtiers look like a group of shaven-headed transvestites, are odd. </p> <p>Despite the gear, Andrew Cryer is a suitably suffering Admetos, David Hounslow is a bluff Heracles and Barrie Rutter himself gets things off to a brisk start as a scene-setting Apollo. But if it is a stirring evening it is largely because of Hughes's moving insistence on the power of memory and passion to triumph over death. </p> <p> At the Viaduct Theatre until September 23. Box office: 01422 255266. Then touring. This review ran in some editions yesterday.</p>",

Kiev reply with a run by Khatskevitch through midfield; he finds Bialkevich outside the area but Van Der Gouw gets there first.<br> <strong>4</strong> Khaladze is brought down by Irwin 30 yards out on the right for a Kiev free-kick but it comes to nothing.<br> <strong>5</strong> Referee Nielsen has a word with Demetradze after a late challenge on Silvestre.<br> <strong>7</strong> United free-kick; Beckham takes from deep in midfield straight into the Kiev area, Kiev counter and United are caught short at the back when Shatskikh gets into the area. Good work by Giggs works the ball out into safety.<br> <strong>8</strong> Almost a goal for United when Giggs plays in Yorke on the edge of the area, but the striker drags his shot wide of the right stick.<br> <strong>10</strong> Kiev lob the ball over the United back line but are caught offside.<br> <strong>12</strong> Giggs finds Silvestre deep in the left, but his cross is into space and easy for Kiev keeper Shovkovsky.<br> <strong>13</strong> A very lively start to the game with Kiev dong a good job of closing United down and forcing them to give away possession. The surface looks heavy and both teams appear to have decided that a quick passing game is the key to a result.<br> <strong>15</strong> Some space for United as Giggs cuts in from the left, but Kiev clear again as he tries to find Yorke.<br> <strong>19</strong> Cole on the left area cuts the ball back for Beckham to rifle in a shot - blocked.<br> <strong>20</strong> Corner to United on the right, but it comes to nothing. Corner to United on the left and Shovkovsky loses sight of the ball before it is cleared.<br> <strong>24</strong> The quick passing game seems to be failing on the dodgy surface and Kiev both sides are finding it hard to hang on to possession.<br> <strong>25</strong> Free-kick to United just over the half-way line. The ball is worked quickly down the right and back for Cole to shoot from the edge of the area. The ball loops up from a deflection and Keane clashes with the keeper as tries to pick up the rebound.<br> <strong>27</strong> Shatskikh tries a shot from distance and is unlucky to see it go narrowly wide.<br> <strong>29</strong> Bialkevich comes close for Kiev when he gets away on the left, cuts inside and works the ball on to his right foot before shooting from just outside the area - Van Der Gouw does well to turn it wide of the far post. <br> <strong>33</strong> United enjoying the best of the possession and still look the more likely to score despite a couple of good chances from Kiev.<br> <strong>35</strong> United in control as Kiev are caught offside yet again.<br> <strong>37</strong> And caught again, although it lookd as though Irwin was playing him on. Lucky, as Irwin then went on to bring down the Kiev player inside the area. <br> <strong>40</strong> Giggs races away through midfield on the counter and finds Cole on the right. He crosses for Beckham on the left but his chip into the area findds no-one. <br> <strong>41</strong> United corner on the right, Beckham takes and Kiev clear.<br> <strong>42</strong> Beckham finds G Neville on the right but the defender over-hits his cross and the move breaks down. Still very much a game of attack and counter-attack. <br> <strong>45</strong> One extra minute to play as the first half draws to a close. Neither team choses to make much use of it. Half-time. Difficult conditions, but will be pleased with their performance so far.</p> <p><strong>46</strong> Andy Cole shoots from 25 yards when he should not have been allowed the space - not enough purchase and it is saved easily.<br> <strong>48</strong> Dmitrulin plays in Shatskikh just inside the area and his great first touch sees the ball fly off the crossbar - a lucky escape for United.<br> <strong>49</strong> Strong start to the second half for Kiev as Shatskikh agains is the danger when he gets on the end of a deep cross into the six-yard box, but his header is way off the mark. <br> <strong>51</strong> Shatskikh again as he gets away on the right, but his hopeful cross towards towards lone man Demetradze is hopelessly off target.<br> <strong>53</strong> United yet to attack in this half,but now Beckham gets involved. He threads the ball through midfield to Cole on the left; he in turn lays it back for Butt to shoot wide from 25 yards.<br> <strong>58</strong> A lovely flick by Giggs on the edge of the Kiev area just fails to give Cole a shooting chance, Kiev break and United have their work cut out as the Ukrainians flood forward.<br> <strong>60</strong> United caught short as Kiev break, with Shatskikh agains the inspiration. United shut the door just in front of the area.<br> <strong>64</strong> Giggs tries to exploit space on the left; Silvestre gets away to the by-line and his cross is held by keeper Shovkovsky to deny Cole a point-blank header.<br> <strong>67 Substitution</strong> Sheringham on for Yorke.<br> <strong>69</strong> Kuzmichev on for Demetradze. Shatskikh has the best chance of the half; after a great run through midfield, he unleashes a shot from 20 yards that Van Der Gouw is at full stretch to turn away via the upright.<br> <strong>71</strong> Van Der Gouw almost blows it for United when he kicks the ball straight to Kiev sub Kuzmichev. He is so surprised by the good fortune that United immediately win it back.<br> <strong>76</strong> The game is still being played at a frantic and somewhat scrappy pace, very much end to end.<br> <strong>78 Substitution</strong> Solskjaer on for Cole.<br> <strong>82</strong> Lots going on, but not a lot happening. Keane blasts in a shot from distance, straight at the goalkeeper. <br> <strong>83 Substitution</strong>The Hungarian Bodnar on for Dmitrulin. <br> <strong>86</strong> This is not a pretty game as Kiev come forward again. Nesmchney makes a run on the left and crosses into the six-yard box; Husin gets up for the header but he should have done better and fails to find a way through the crowd.<br> <strong>87 Substitution</strong> Fedorov on for Husin.<br> <strong>89</strong> Kiev comes close agaim as Nesmachney fires ion a cross from the left - Johnsen the man to make a nuisance of himself and deny the scoring chance. <br> <strong>90</strong> Two minutes extra to play. A job well done by United, who have been well-organised and coped with pretty much everything that Kiev have thrown at them, which hasn't been a great deal. Full-time.<br></p>",
  "A sea plane carrying at least 14 people was hijacked today after taking off from Cuba. It went down in international waters off Key West, Federal Aviation Administration officials in the US said. <p>The fate of the people on board was not known imeadiately, and it was not clear if the plane, which is able to land on water, had crashed.</p> <p>\"We were just told by FAA at this point that the aircraft was in the water,\" said Coast Guard Lt Cmdr Ron LaBrec in Miami.</p> <p>The Russian-made Antonov AN-2 Colt went down about 80 miles southwest of Key West, Florida, Coast Guard officials said. Coast Guard rescuers were heading to the scene. </p> <p>\"Apparently it was hijacked, and the pilot indicated they only had one hours' fuel,\" said Lauren Gail Stover, associate director of Miami-Dade County Aviation Department.</p> <p>\"The plane disappeared from US radar shortly before 11am,\" Ms Stover said.</p> <p>The long-range single-engine bush plane is equipped with pontoons for taking off and landing on water.

  "The big news at the opening of the Liberal Democrat conference yesterday was asteroids. <p>The MP for Montgomery, Lembit Opik, has been warning for ages about bodies from outer space hurtling into us, and now the Sainsbury task force scarily says he may be right. \"Opik vindicated\" was the headline on his press release (as opposed to \"Opec vindicated\" which was last week's story.) So when Mr Opik went in to watch Charles Kennedy speak on the petrol crisis, why wasn't he even wearing a crash helmet?</p> <p>Mr Kennedy's speech was tough, uncompromising, but balanced. On the one hand, he said, we had to make the environmental case for using less petrol. On the other hand, the price of petrol had to come down. His audience clearly agreed with both these assertions.</p> <p>\"We have to listen,\" he went on, \"as well as to lead. This week, let us listen as well as lead,\" which I took to mean: we must tell the people what to do, but we must do as they say. We must lead but we must also follow. We must demand coffee but must not be afraid to drink tea. We must sink our teeth into the red meat of power while simultaneously enjoying the vegetarian option ...</p> <p> Mr Matthew Taylor, grandly described as the \"shadow chancellor\", said the petrol protest was helped by mobile phones and the internet. Nowadays people could by-pass governments and make their own decisions. \"In the politics of the 21st century, politicians will need to be honest, because now the people have the power to keep them honest,\" he said. </p> <p>Fat chance, I thought, as I went off to the BT/Hansard Society stand which shows an MP's office in this excitingly honest future. They will wear special glasses which will project computer screens onto their eyeballs. They will conduct video surgeries. With tiny cameras they will also - and this is the really cool part - be able to interview themselves and put the results straight onto their website, so cutting out the middlemen, TV interviewers. </p> <p>They got me to record my views on the petrol crisis. When it was played back my voice sounded normal, but the image on the screen was delayed and cut up into jerky movements of half a second each, giving the impression that some incapable drunk had seized control of the site, which was fair enough, except not at 10.45 in the morning.</p> <p>But that's a minor hitch. MPs will have to resist the temptation to interview themselves blandly. \"I'm glad you asked me that question, and I'd like to reply in five ways...\" won't do. Voters will demand Paxman and Today-style confrontation. \"If you'll just allow me to answer the question\" people will shout at themselves. </p> <p>\"I told you, no questions about my private life!\" they will yell at themselves, before pulling off their mikes and staging an angry walk out from their own front room.</p> <p>After lunch we had the debate on civil partnerships, which include what is generally known as gay marriage. Predictably everyone was in favour, except those who felt that the motion didn't go far enough. Sue Vincent pointed out that it didn't bar anyone from having two registered partnerships at the same time. \"This gives the green light for bigamy. Liberal Democrats, the party of bigamy\" she cried. It could win a hundred seats.</p> <p>Then Richard Coxon complained that the law would not allow him to order his partner's life support machine cut off. (I should have told him that there are some straights who would happily switch their spouse's life support machine off, even if they weren't ill.) \"But I can have a joint Sainsbury's reward card,\" he went on, \"All power to Sainsbury's especially now as its a nice red colour instead of blue!\"</p> <p>Liberal Democrats, destroying gay stereotypes everywhere! stereotypes everywhere!</p>",
  "<p>Floating above the clouds of tear gas at last December's Seattle protests, a large white helium balloon carried the most telling and dangerous message of the whole affair. It didn't demand justice for sea turtles or an end to repression in Burma--in fact, it didn't really speak to any of the myriad specific issues raised by the World Trade Organization or its General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades. Instead the slogan was short and simple: \"Wake Up, Muggles.\"</p> <p>Perhaps there is someone reading this who has yet to devour J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter chronicles. If so, a Muggle is someone like-you and I. The people who pay attention to business, watch television, and don't notice that there's a world of wizards and dragons and such right under their noses. Or, in political terms, someone who has accepted the idea that nothing really matters in the world but money. Which is to say, pretty much all of us in the post-Reagan, post-Thatcher years. Remember Bill Clinton's rallying cry: \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Well, the rallying cry of Seattle--and of Washington D.C., site of massive anti-IMF protests in the spring, and of Melbourne, where the World Economic Forum and Bill Gates got a noisy reception this week, and most likely of Prague when the World Bank goes there next week--is that it's not the economy, stupid. It's the environment, it's the right of human beings to live freely, it's the need to pass along the massive wealth of the past decade to more than the few.</p> <p>For a decade or two, we'd gone beyond politics, at least in America. Old liberals had to confess their menu of government programs hadn't done all that they'd promised; young people bought squarely into the idea that taking the fetters off business would benefit us all. Both parties pushed the same basic platform--in fact, one of the ironies of the Clinton administration is that a Republican president would have had a much harder time pushing NAFTA, GATT, and China trade legislation through Congress. All eyes were fixed on the fantastic exploding Dow, which seemed to support the conventional wisdom, and on the wild new communications technologies that seemed to underwrite that prosperity. But prosperity does odd things, including eventually freeing people to think about other topics, from the destruction of rainforests to the melting of the poles. And the net, it turns out, lets young'uns do more than trade Napster files. The TV networks had no idea Seattle was on the way--they were scrambling to parachute crews in for the big battles along Pike Street. But if you'd been visiting the right web sites for the month before, you'd have had a pretty good idea of what was going down.</p> <p> And those web sites, by the way, exist around the world. This analysis is taking hold among dissident thinkers around the Third World. It's true that the elites of developing nations are among the biggest backers of expanded trade--but it's also true, as people are increasingly starting to realize, that those elites don't really represent the people they rule over. The first morning of the WTO protests in Seattle, most of the delegates bumping up against the locked arms of protesters outside the gates were from Africa, Asia, Latin America (the American negotiators had gotten word of what was going on and stayed safely in their hotels). Though they came from wickedly poor countries, they were clearly members of the Gold Card class. You could feel their bewilderment and fear--these were people who had never felt powerless before. Indeed, their hold on power is likely to be more deeply shaken by the year of protests than the power brokers of the First World. The movement, if you can call it that, against the institutions of economic power in the world remains small. It doesn't come close to rivaling the movement against, say, high petrol prices: that's still what really scares the politicians. But what started in Seattle is more prophetic by far. At root it challenges the unspoken idea that all our problems will be solved by growing the economy ever-larger. That's a very hard idea for politicans to co-opt (though Clinton and Blair have certainly been trying, at least rhetorically). It's a fundamental idea, and if the ice caps keep melting, it's a notion that may change the flavour of this century.</p> <p> Bill McKibben is the author of <strong>The End of Nature</strong> and numerous other books on environment and culture.

  "Russia's media wars and the battle for control of the country's two biggest television stations dominated the Moscow press today, as the latest moves by the exiled media magnate, Vladimir Gusinsky, appeared on several front pages. <p>The newspapers are dwelling on revelations that Mr Gusinsky, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin who was jailed for three days on embezzlement charges in July, fled abroad after the government brokered a secret deal in which he agreed to sell his huge Media Most empire - including the NTV television channel - to Gazprom, Russia's gas monopoly.</p> <p>While Mr Gusinsky's own newspaper, Segodnya, splashed with the headline that the government's ''media policy is a racket'', the Kommersant business daily, which is owned by the media mogul's rival, Boris Berezovsky, put an interview with Mr Gusinsky on the front-page headlined ''I Signed The Agreement at Gunpoint.'' The English-language Moscow Times reported that ''Gusinsky Swapped Assets for Liberty. </p> <p>While the ongoing media war dominated the quality papers, the main tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda, led on an underworld slaying in Cheboksary, 500 miles south of Moscow, in which Alexandra Petrova, a 19-year-old woman who won the Miss Russia beauty contest four years ago, died. </p> <p>She was in a car with her common law husband and a businessman who runs the local market when all three were shot dead by a man using a silenced pistol.</p>",
  "The significant business of the Liberal Democrat conference has been taking place today amid the exhibition stands and coffee bars of the Bournemouth International Conference Centre. <p>Delegates have gossiped about the party's good showing in today's Guardian poll and compared plans for campaigning for the next general election.</p> <p>The mood was cheerful, but also mixed scorn for the government's behaviour over the last week with anger at the tactics used by the petrol protestors.</p> <p>The party seems uncertain as to whether it is now time to make concessions to what seems to be overwhelming public demand for cheaper fuel.</p> <p>On the fringe, the day's most interesting events will come this evening, when former leader Paddy Ashdown breaks his almost complete silence since retiring as leader with a speech on globalisation, while Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore visits, presumably to explain why he cannot stand the party's policies.</p> <p>In the conference hall itself, debates have been going as party planners would wish.</p> <p>The key debate on law and order was led by Simon Hughes, the party's home affairs spokesman and runner-up to Charles Kennedy in last year's leadership contest.</p> <p>He called for the creation of a Community Safety Constabulary to support the police, as well as a 6,000 increase in police numbers.</p> <p>But the significant news was his announcement that Liberal Democrat peers will vote against the second reading of legislation restricting the right of people charged with certain offences to elect to be tried by jury.</p> <p>Hughes's attack on what he called \"this disgraceful and unjustified\" bill not only went down well with delegates, but means that the bill is almost certain to be defeated in the upper house.</p> <p>One attempt to push the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill through Parliament has already been thwarted by peers worried about its effect on civil liberties.</p> <p>Earlier, Liberal Democrats gave a standing ovation to the general secretary of the TUC, John Monks.

  "<p>The lovely Lauren Booth, six-and-a-half months pregnant and resplendent in Schiaparelli pink, graced the \"personal viewpoint\" pages of the Sunday Express magazine this week. A full-page portrait opposite a punchy think piece. Nothing unusual about that - the prime minister's sister-in-law is no shrinking violet - but what really did catch the eye was the ashtray, the packet of Marlboro Lights, the lighter and the swirling smug of bluewhite smoke, curling up and over her swollen Schiaparelli-pink belly. \"I can almost hear your gasps of disgust and your tuts of derision,\" wrote Booth, for yes, she is breaking the cardinal rule of political correctness: she is smoking while with child. </p> <p>The tone of Booth's piece was, of course, defiant. Women always used to smoke while pregnant - they say it did their children no harm. She smokes barely half a dozen a week - hardly a hanging offence. In fact, she said, her midwife was surprisingly sanguine about it, telling her: \"Oh don't worry too much, it's the heavy smokers we worry about.\" Lauren told how the kind of men who wouldn't give up their seat on the Tube for her would berate her about the \"fag\" in her mouth. All interesting points. </p> <p>Yet how profoundly shocking that picture was! And the headline -\"Puff Mummy\" - golly! What will wild Lauren (she also admits to the odd glass of wine) be up to next? </p> <p>Which is curious really, because a lot of pregnant women smoke in this country: around one in four of them. That's 150,000 women a year . These women continue to do so in the face of campaign after campaign on the evils of smoking. They will tell you that they are addicted; that smoking is one of their greatest pleasures; that they simply do not believe that the odd fag can really do that much damage to their child; that they have cut down, they are making an effort, at least; that their mother smoked while pregnant with them, for God's sake; that they smoked with their first child and he was fine... all the same interesting points that Ms Booth was making, really. </p> <p>It's just that, on the whole, we don't see these women: they tend to be the poorest among us and they don't get a picture spread in a magazine to explain why they are smoking while pregnant. All that is truly shocking about the Booth picture and article is that (a) we don't normally see pictures of pregnant women smoking and (b) she is a well-connected, middle-class young woman: the kind of girl who buys organic food and goes to yoga and totally freaks out and transforms every aspect of her life when she gets pregnant because It's The Biggest Thing That Ever Happened To Anyone. </p> <p>So how bad is it, smoking while pregnant? The answer is that if you smoke very little, there will probably be no detectable effect on your unborn child. That doesn't mean there won't be an impact on your child's health or development: it means any impact will probably be undetectable. </p> <p>With women who smoke heavily, the effects tend to be more obvious. Babies tend to be smaller. They are more at risk of deformities. They are more prone to asthma. They might be less clever. They are more likely to die in their cot. They are more prone to lung disease as adults... And, of course, the mother is more likely to miscarry. Another serious problem is that a woman who cannot quit while pregnant is unlikely to quit while breastfeeding or as her child grows up. </p> <p>It is true that many women smoke while pregnant and produce a healthy baby. The problem is that they'll never know if their baby might have been taller, or brighter, or, in the long-term, less susceptible to cancer. Ms Booth is not a criminal, she is simply taking a tiny risk with her baby's health. Some may dismiss her article as irresponsible but the fact is that she is an addict and, who knows, perhaps her words will have given some comfort to all the pregnant women out there who don't keep it down to six fags a week. After all, Lauren is the PM's sister-in-law, and if she says it is political correctness gone mad, well...</p>",
  "<p>Morris is my brother, affectionately known in the family as Mo. He has been very fat since I can remember, though our mother dates his weight gain from the removal of his tonsils at the age of five. </p> <p>Family photographs show a progression from normal stockiness at two, through childhood chubbiness, to frank fatness by 10. From then on, he is notably large in all but his wedding photographs. For the love of a good woman, Mo slimmed down. </p> <p>He still loves her and has three (slim) children with her. But the weight has piled back on, and now Mo is desperate. He has tried the lot: diets, counselling, swimming 50 lengths a night, jaw wiring and liquid-only diets. Now he wants an operation. A quick-fix, long-term, irreversible solution that will shift the blubber for ever. \"I'm 39 now and weigh about 140kg that I'll admit to. I'm finding it harder to move around now and that frightens me,\" says Mo. </p> <p>\"I had my jaw wired twice and lost around eight stone each time. But when the wires came off, I gradually regained the weight over a year or so. I react best to mechanical solutions but the jaw wiring was too short-term for me, which is why I'm considering surgery.\" </p> <p>Professor John Baxter is one of only a handful of surgeons in the UK who regularly performs obesity surgery. He is apoplectic in his rage over the paucity of options available to people like my brother. </p> <p>\"Between 1% and 2% of the UK population is seriously obese, with a body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in metres, squared) over 40. We know that lifestyle and dietary advice don't work for this group of people and we also know that left untreated, six out of seven of them will die prematurely as a result of their obesity. Yet only 200 obesity operations are carried out a year in the UK, many of them privately,\" says Baxter. </p> <p>\"We are totally hopeless with regard to obesity surgery in this country. There seems to be an attitude that obesity is a self-imposed condition caused by lack of self-control. But it is a metabolic disease, like diabetes, and needs treating. Drug and genetic cures are still a long way off and there is absolutely no doubt that surgery offers the best hope for this group.\" </p> <p>The dilemma for people like my brother is this: he is currently well and enjoying a full, happy life building up a successful business and enjoying his young family. If he opts for surgery he stands a one in 100 risk of dying as a result of the operation. If he remains as obese as he is now, he has only a one in seven chance of reaching his normal life expectancy and has a high probability of developing diabetes, joint pains, high blood pressure predisposing him to stroke and heart attacks, acid reflux, asthma and urinary incontinence. </p> <p>Dr Pierre Bouloux, consultant endocrinologist at the Royal Free Hospital in London, understands why people like Mo opt for surgery, but he sounds a note of caution. \"Surgery is no better or worse than wearing a tight belt round your midriff. In the fullness of time, surgery will be seen as rather barbaric as we develop better drugs to speed up energy expenditure or ways of modifying the gene defects that cause extreme obesity. It's unlikely we'll ever have one drug to suit everyone because there are at least 20 different genes involved, as well as differences in eating behaviour.\" Bouloux recommends a 650-calorie-a-day liquid diet of one litre of semi-skimmed milk, fresh orange juice and vitamins. </p> <p>He favours wiring the jaws so you can't eat solid food in the event that willpower alone is not enough. Drugs such as metformin, used to increase the body's sensitivity to insulin, and orlistat, which prevents the absorption of fat from the diet, can also be offered. </p> <p>But prof Baxter says the success rate after surgery is better than any of these measures. There are three main operations in current use; bypassing the stomach so that food isn't absorbed, putting a band round the stomach, or stapling across it to reduce stomach capacity drastically. </p> <p>Bypass surgery remains the gold standard, according to Baxter. But both bypass and stapling the stomach involve a major operation and a large incision. Banding the stomach by putting an inflatable band round the top of the stomach can be done by keyhole surgery. </p> <p>The band is inflated by injecting a small chamber which is implanted in the abdominal muscle. The staples or band reduce the volume of the stomach so that it can hold only tiny amounts at a time; overfill it and you vomit. \"If you cheat, you chunder,\" says New Zealand-born Baxter. </p> <p>The results are good; most will lose 60-70% of their excess weight, although Baxter warns that few ever reach normal weight. And 90% of a US series of patients followed up for 10 years managed to maintain their weight loss. \"There are some oddballs who liquidise Mars bars and so on and could out-eat any operation. But they are the exception,\" says Baxter. Most will lose over half their excess weight, but at a price. </p> <p>In a recent fiery editorial in the British Medical Journal, Baxter quoted a Swedish study comparing 2,000 obese patients treated with surgery with 2,000 treated with drugs. He says surgery has been shown to be overwhelmingly better than drugs in improving quality of life, curing diabetes, controlling high blood pressure, improving rates of employment and reducing costs to the health service. He asks why fewer than 200 operations a year are carried out in the UK and blames the lack of specialist training for surgeons in obesity surgery and society's ignorance and prejudice. He admits that there is a risk, but says that 93% of those operated on have no significant problems as a result. </p> <p>There are fewer than 23 surgeons in the UK doing these operations and the UK lags far behind the rest of Europe, the US and Australasia. Baxter wants to see an obesity surgeon, supported by a team of specialist dieticians, psychologists, anaesthetists and nurses, in every large hospital in the country. </p> <p>The operations are not a quick fix. They represent a life sentence of never being able to eat normally, having to nibble at tiny morsels at family occasions and meals out with friends. It means forever forgoing the pleasures of a good meal. And you have to be a gambler to walk into an operation which carries a 1% risk of killing you when there's nothing wrong with you, apart from being fat. But for those who are willing to take the risk, there should surely be better availability.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Food allergies</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Q</strong><br> I think I have a food allergy but have had no help to find out what I am allergic to. I get blinding headaches, tummy bloating and cramps from time to time. My GP seems to put it all down to stress but did, reluctantly, refer me to an allergy clinic which apparently has a two-year waiting list. I can't afford to go private. What advice could you give me? </p> <p><strong> A</strong><br>One third of the entire British population think they have an allergy and many are in the same position as you in finding it hard to get specific advice. The UK Food Standards Agency reckons that probably only 10% of would-be allergy sufferers actually do have a provable allergy. Many of us are sensitive to particular foods which you find out by trial and error. I know I get headaches and tummy pains when I eat breakfast cereal. If I avoid it, I'm OK and when I try it again, the symptoms return. That's all the proof I really need and there's no test that could prove it more effectively. Food allergies tend to cause swollen lips, tightening of the throat, vomiting or a rash within a few hours of eating the culprit. Adults with a particular food allergy, as opposed to sensitivity, are usually all too aware of their allergy and avoid that food like the plague. </p> <p><strong> Male menopause</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q </strong><br>Is there such a thing as the male menopause? Is there a test for it? I'm a 50-year-old man who is finding life very difficult at the moment. I seem to lack motivation, sex drive or enthusiasm for anything at work or at home. How can I find out more? </p> <p><strong> A</strong><br>Forgive me for being pedantic, but obviously there is no such thing as a male menopause because the word means the cessation of periods and you can't cease what you never started. However, there's no doubt that as men get older, muscle turns to fat and the hormone that drives virility, testosterone, becomes less rampant. A blood test to check testosterone doesn't usually give you useful information because you can have normal blood levels but become less responsive to the effects of testosterone. Failing responsiveness to testosterone is a gradual process and affects everyone differently and unpredictably. The loss of enjoyment in life that you are experiencing is more likely to be due to depression than hormonal changes and you may feel you'd like to explore this further with a sympathetic partner, friend or health professional. </p> <p><strong> Cataract cures</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Q</strong><br> I've just been to my optician and was shocked to learn that I have a cataract. I'm 72 and had been aware that my eyesight wasn't as sharp as it had been, but with new glasses I've been managing fine. Will I need an operation? </p> <p><strong> A</strong><br>Cataracts are a thickening of the lens of the eye which leads to gradual loss of vision. You don't need an operation unless you want one and you probably won't want one until the cataract starts to interfere with your daily life. The surgery itself is one of the success stories of our age. Complications are rare and the success rate extremely high. </p> <p><strong> Morning sickness</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q</strong> I'm two months pregnant and I can't cope with the morning sickness. Mine actually lasts most of the day and is making me feel wretched. I don't want to take any drugs, but I don't think I can cope with this much longer.<br> </p> <p><strong> A</strong><br>Eat little and often, avoid the more whacky cravings like pickled eggs which might make anyone nauseous, and don't let yourself get too tired. Ginger helps some people. Acupuncture has been shown to help and is safe in pregnancy. Nausea can be a sign of a urinary infection so you could take a urine sample to your GP or midwife to be checked. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

  "<p>When it comes to taking drugs, women have always been seen as cautious and men as reckless, blithely gobbling handfuls of pills or shooting up into any old vein. But new research has shown that, at least where ecstasy is concerned, female users have cast off anxieties about losing control or spoiling their looks to ape male consumption patterns. </p> <p>Sharron Hinchliff, a research associate at Sheffield University, studied a group of young women in Yorkshire and found that they started taking ecstasy at a younger age than men and did not take less of it, as previous research had indicated. Their main aim was pleasure and even those who had hallucinations or convulsions seemed undeterred about future use. </p> <p>\"It is clear they use drugs in ways attributed to men. They reject 'ladylike' behaviour,\" Hinchliff concludes. </p> <p>While a nice middle-class girl can get away with a wild weekend on ecstasy or shoving a bit of coke up her nose (as long as she doesn't lose septum and dignity), the male establishment still divides women into good girls and bad girls, and drug-using women are always the latter. But their attitude to drugs is something the government needs to consider as new \u00a31m cabinet office research into the needs of female and ethnic minority drug users gets under way. At present, most services are stuck in a 70s time warp focused on the white male heroin user. </p> <p>Erin O'Mara, 30, a drug user for more than 15 years and editor of drug users' magazine Black Poppy, laughs at the idea that a token \u00a31m from the government can plug the gaps in services for women. Nor does she believe it will change the entrenched attitudes of those who wield power over female drug users - the doctors who may or may not write them a prescription, the social workers who may or may not let them keep their kids, the rehab staff who may or may not throw them out on to the streets if they fail to meet often unrealistic targets. </p> <p>Dr Chris Ford, chair of the Methadone Alliance, says women's terror of having their children taken away if they continue to use drugs is still the main reason they don't come forward. \"One of my passions is making people realise that drug user can equal good parent.\" </p> <p>O'Mara has drawn up a wish list that includes better detox and rehab services, along with access to female drug workers, of which there is a nationwide shortage. Male workers can sometimes play the knight in shining armour to \"save\" a woman from herself while at the same time they may be exploiting the vulnerability of chaotic addiction by adding sexual tension, implicit or explicit. </p> <p>Drugs worker Gary Sutton recalls a pretty, blonde, 23-year-old who sought help with a heroin problem. \"She was young and attractive and had a job, so her male key worker decided she could be saved and gave her a prescription for detox drugs to wean her off heroin. In fact she wanted methadone to allow her to attain some stability and sort her life out. Without this, she relapsed and 'failed' the programme.\" </p> <p>This emphasis on passing the detox test as if it were a handful of GCSEs means women, particularly those with children, must passively accept an ever-reducing amount of prescription methadone from the NHS. Meanwhile they may be \"double scripting\" in the private sector because they can't function without drugs but know they must play the game and appear to cut down if they don't want to lose their children. One female heroin user, Lisa Davies, was so disenchanted with drug treatment services that last month she declined a community punishment for shoplifting to fund her habit and asked the court instead to send her to jail as she saw this as her only hope of getting clean and keeping her children. </p> <p> It's not only the professionals who rank drug users. There's a hierarchy within the community, too, with male aristocratic cocaine users at the top of the pyramid and female crack users in the gutter with the solvent abusers. </p> <p>\"A female drug user gains points from her male peers if she's young and attractive. Good earning power and the ability to keep her mouth shut if she gets busted by the police are also desirable attributes,\" Sutton says. </p> <p>Often a drug-using woman will have a dealer for a boyfriend, so is unlikely to access any services because she will be getting a regular supply. But in a mirror of the docile 50s housewife who was handed weekly housekeeping money by her officebound husband, the dominant man will often control his girlfriend's drug use. </p> <p>\"We call it powder power,\" O'Mara says. \"You sometimes see a 60-year-old drug dealer wearing an attractive 20-year-old on his arm like a handbag. She can't argue with him in case she doesn't get her fix that night. He decides when she's going to get her hit and holds it back if she is too sleepy to have sex with him.\" </p> <p>You very rarely see women dealers, according to Sutton. \"It's just too dangerous for them and they would be targeted by male gangs. Men have more drug career opportunities. Women's options are pretty limited - shoplifting or prostitution.\" </p> <p>O'Mara adds: \"When a couple are using drugs and get into debt with their dealer, the boyfriend tends to send his girl along to flutter her eyelashes at him. Next thing she knows she's giving him a hand job to cancel the debt and prevent the dealer from breaking her boyfriend's legs, and that's how it starts.\" </p> <p>With crack use, the lowest point can be hit extremely quickly, Sutton says. \"Crack is the only drug with which the high and the comedown are almost simultaneous. It stimulates an instant need for sex and once a woman's money has disappeared and her life becomes sex for crack in a crackhouse, there's even less chance of her escaping from the cycle.\" </p> <p>Sue Noot, clinical services coordinator for Thames Gateway NHS Trust Addiction Services, says women-specific issues around drug use have been ignored for too long. \"Women tend to get unhealthier more quickly than men. Their veins collapse faster, they are more likely to develop abscesses and one of the things some of them like about using drugs is that they lose weight. If they go into rehab and put it back on, they can get very depressed. Those who do stop using often relapse just before they have a period if they're suffering from PMT. This is almost never taken into account by services.\" </p> <p>O'Mara urges the government to listen to women. \"By choosing drugs, women are going against their socially prescribed role as selfless nurturers. Our behaviour is perceived as selfish, deviant and criminal. But we have the same needs and rights as others to be treated with care, understanding and dignity. Drugs tsar Keith Hellawell says that listening to users is a central plank of his 10-year strategy. Women need to speak up and the government must start listening.\"</p>",
  "<p>A \u00a3100m government scheme is published today to ensure that everyone has access to an NHS dentist by next year.</p> <p>Dentists will be offered new incentives to see NHS patients rather than carry out more lucrative private work. Around four million people in the UK do not have access to an NHS dentist, the British Dental Association claims.</p> <p>NHS dentists have become like gold dust around the country since dentists voted with their feet some years ago.</p> <p>Many opted to offer private services only while some offered to see young children on the NHS-on condition that their parents were seen privately.</p> <p>Some stalwarts continued to offer dental services on the NHS, but bemoaned the paperwork and, more worryingly, the inferior materials that they had to use when filling NHS teeth as opposed to private cavities.</p> <p>Now the government has woken up to the inevitable consequences; the nation's teeth are rotting, as those with the poorest dental hygiene struggle to find dental care they can afford.</p> <p>Four million people don't have access to a dentist at present and you can bet your bottom dollar that those are the four million who need it most.</p> <p>Dental checkups save expensive fillings and dental work; they are cost effective for the taxpayer and most of us would far rather let the dentist look in our mouths twice a year and have a quick scrape and polish, than have to suffer the drill.</p> <p>Preventive dentistry is a good thing, as are free, regular eye checks to screen for glaucoma in over 50s.</p> <p>But are all health checks worthwhile? You can definitely have too much of a good thing with some tests raising more anxiety than they are worth.</p> <p>An increasing number of companies now pay for their employees to have private health checks. And all GP surgeries offer a health check when you join a new practice.</p> <p>Pharmacies and health food shops offer all sorts of testing opportunities - instant pulse checks, blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and bowel cancer kits.</p> <p>You can even send your hair off to private labs that claim to check for vitamin and mineral deficiencies.</p> <p>There is seemingly no end to the number of practitioners willing to take your money to check your health.</p> <p>But health checks that offer a standardised battery of tests may be ignoring the problems that you are most at risk of developing while offering other tests that don't give you useful information.</p> <p>To be useful to you, preventive tests and health checks need to be targeted to you as an individual.</p> <p>Everyone over the age of 20 benefits from a blood pressure check every five years; women on the pill or HRT and anyone whose blood pressure has been raised in the past or has a family history of heart disease should have it checked more regularly-say, annually.</p> <p>Blood tests for diabetes, high cholesterol, raised PSA indicating possible prostate cancer don't need to be carried out on everyone - the need and frequency of testing will depend on individual susceptibility to a condition.</p> <p>Specific screening for breast, cervical and bowel cancer is a good idea if you are at risk.</p> <p>The National Screening programmes offering breast and cervical cancer at regular intervals for all, regardless of their level of risk, are fairly crude ways of trying to pick up these diseases at a very early stage. In time, we are likely to be offered screening at intervals that reflect our level of risk.</p> <p>In all probability, low-risk women will be offered a smear every 10 years, and high-risk women every year.</p> <p>So yes, preventive tests can be useful but you need to ask your GP or medical adviser some specific questions; with my history, which tests should I have done and when?</p> <p>The ideal preventive medicine package is like a well made suit - all your measurements and requirements should be fully discussed, your vital statistics should be carefully recorded, and it should be tailor made to fit you and your needs.</p> <p>The worst sort of testing gives you meaningless results, false reassurance and unnecessary anxiety.

  "<p>Excite Chello expects its merger to be approved within the month and is gearing up to expand into new markets and IPO early next year. </p> <p>A war chest of around E100,000 has been set aside for acquisitions and strategic stakes, adding to those Excite @ Home already has in electronic greetings card firm BlueMountain Arts and desktop art firm Webshots. </p> <p>Evan Rudowski, managing director, media at Excite Chello, said a number of acquisitions and stakes would be made once the \u00a33.6bn merger inked earlier this year between broadband giants Excite @ Home and Chello receives regulatory approval.

The UK arm of Excite was, until recently, 50% owned by Excite @ Home and 50% owned by BT.

However, Rudowski said there were a number of benefits that being partnered with BT offered. </p> <p>Excite Chello has remained quiet about how it plans to roll out broadband services in the UK - one of the only European countries where it hasn't yet got a footprint. While Chello parent company UPC recently bought a 25% stake in Telewest, it is not certain whether Excite Chello will use the Telewest cable networks, along with NTL networks, to enable it to move into the UK. Rudowski also said that Excite Chello was talking to BT about leasing local DSL loops and hadn't yet ruled out either broadband option. </p> <p>The deal combines Dutch company Chello's broadband Internet access services - available to 30m homes in 15 countries - with the American Excite @ Home's Internet content covering 10 countries throughout Europe and Asia-Pacific.

Officials at the US Embassy in Prague, however, have expressed their private fear that better-resourced far-right groups from neighbouring countries, particularly Germany, could make a bee-line for Prague in the coming days.</p> <p>Czech-based skin-head groups such as National Resistance, National Alliance, the Patriotic Republican Party and Defence of the Nation, have lodged an application to hold a demonstration on September 23, on Letna Plain, in the north of the city.</p> <p>But already some of the 215 protest applications that have been lodged with the City Hall in Prague, look to be under threat.</p> <p>Miroslava Studenovska, the major of the Prague 4 Nusle district, where the summit venue is located, said that she had had no choice but to ban protests in the district and block off green areas.</p> <p>''Instead we have established a coordination centre which will be in operation from now until early October. A free telephone number has also been made available to provide citizens with necessary information,'' she said.</p> <p>Those arriving in Prague yesterday from all over Europe were being given flyers in Czech, English, French, German and Spanish. \"Read before demonstrations'\", the leaflets said.</p> <p>The flyers list protesters' rights according to Czech law, inform them about the status of foreigners and offer useful telephone numbers.</p> <p>Fifteen thousand camping places have been made available for protesters at Strahov Stadium, a huge former communist monstrosity big enough to fit five football pitches, which, these days, is normally just home to a drive-in cinema.</p> <p>So far, 5,000 people have booked places for the temporary tent city via the internet. Others will stay at Dzuban campground in the north east of the city or in various squats dotted around Prague.</p> <p>On Saturday, journalists were informed just two hours before of the location outside Prague where demonstration management techniques were being practised.</p> <p>The boot camp, on a rundown farm, 30 miles outside Prague, has been home for the past few days of 250 activists, who have been taught how to behave in demonstrations, as well as the techniques of tree-climbing and samba.</p> <p>On Tuesday they will move to a secret location in Prague.</p>",
  "George W Bush changed his tack and his tone in the US presidential election campaign yesterday, seeking to revive his flagging fortunes with an issues-based drive for middle-class votes in the battleground states. <p>The Republican candidate began a 12-city tour with a visit to an Arkansas maternity ward, where he waxed lyrical on the joys of fatherhood at the start of a week in which he aims to highlight his \"cradle-to-grave\" domestic policy agenda and ditch his reputation for negative campaigning.</p> <p>It was the start of \"an important week in this campaign\", he admitted in a speech in Little Rock, \"a week that speaks to the aspirations and hopes of middle-class families all across the nation.\"</p> <p>The visit to the maternity ward kicked off a determined effort by the Republicans to regain control of the election agenda from Vice-President Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, who continues to extend his recent lead in the opinion polls, not just nationally but in many of the states that will decide the election.</p> <p>\"This is a very focused, more aggressive effort to let voters know where Governor Bush stands on the major issues of the day,\" his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, told reporters before the start of the latest campaign swing. </p> <p>Each day of the week would feature \"metaphor\" visits to enable Mr Bush to set out his stall on issues such as education, welfare, taxes and pensions, Mr Fleischer said.</p> <p>Mr Bush will end the week with another visit to Florida, where he will talk about his plans for the elderly. The visit to the state where his brother Jeb is governor, and which most strategists originally put in the Republican camp, shows how strongly Mr Gore is doing in the battleground states.</p> <p>With some polls showing Mr Gore threatening to take a dominant lead, Mr Bush launched a \"Blueprint for the Middle Class\", a 16-page summary of his policy proposals, and began highlighting his new slogan: \"Real Plans for Real People.\"</p> <p>\"It's a real plan. It isn't one of those things with a lot of fine print in it. It's a real plan to help families help themselves,\" he said before going on to Missouri and Illinois.</p> <p>The move is a calculated risk, since the polls that show Mr Gore leading also show him well ahead on most of the issues the Republicans want to highlight. But Mr Bush has come under fierce pressure from within his party to focus on themes that the voters repeatedly say matter most to them.</p> <p>The most recent polls differ about the extent of Mr Gore's lead, but there is no disagreement about the fact that, after months of seeming to be on course for victory, Mr Bush is struggling to prevent the vice-president succeeding Bill Clinton on November 7.</p> <p>The latest Newsweek poll shows Mr Gore with a 50% to 38% lead among registered voters, and a 52% to 38% advantage among likely voters - the biggest leads he has had in any national poll since the candidates began their campaigns for the White House more than two years ago.</p> <p>Other polls show Mr Gore with only a single-figure lead, but all demonstrate that he is widening the gap. A new Harris Interactive survey gives Mr Gore a 46% to 43% lead, while the latest Gallup three-day tracking poll shows him at 49%, against Mr Bush's 41%. The Green candidate, Ralph Nader, is on 3%, and Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party has 1%.</p> <p>As well as reining back Mr Gore, Mr Bush particularly needs to stop the erosion of his lead among male voters. The latest Gallup figures show that this lead among men has fallen from 20 points two weeks ago to just three points. Mr Gore leads strongly among women voters.</p> <p>Gore advisers dismissed the Bush relaunch as \"pictures and no substance, reflective of a campaign that's all imagery and no ideas\". So confident are they, they issued a cheeky rebuttal yesterday of part of Mr Bush's agenda. Under the heading \"Bush's child care and pre-school proposals\", the press release from the Gore campaign consisted of a blank sheet of paper.</p>",
  "<p>I'm proud to be a Reading Champion for the National Reading Campaign as one of a number of writers, sports people, entertainers, fathers, grandads, big brothers and friends who promote books for unstruck boys. Sexist? Yes - but let's be charitable and think of it as positive discrimination. Here is a selection of six books - some new, some older favourites, all paperbacks - to tempt the lads, none of which would fail to tempt the girls either. </p> <p>Gene Kemp's <strong> The Turbulent Term of Tyke Tiler</strong> (Puffin Modern Classics, \u00a34.99) is rebel Tyke's own account of helping underdog Danny Price to overcome his problems. It's got heart, it's fast and it's funny - with an edge-of-the-seat climax and a smack of a surprise waiting at the end. </p> <p>Anyone into bikes and laughs and satisfying plots will enjoy Chris Powing's <strong> The Mustang Machine</strong> (Barn Owl Books, \u00a33.99). Despite its sharp realistic edge, the story's big \"grip\" is a fantasy bike with a stallion's mind. But who tames it? Tim, a flushed, fever-eyed, serious hospital case. An exciting read, with depths. </p> <p><strong> The Killer Underpants</strong> by Michael Lawrence (Orchard Books, \u00a33.99) needs to be read by kids themselves because no adult will get the words out for laughing. Jiggy's new underpants have a power of their own; they control him, chasing their own devil plans. But like Tim, Jiggy lives in our world of home and school. Fantastic and real - and very funny. </p> <p>Kara May's <strong> Yeti Boy</strong> (Collins, \u00a33.99) is Fenn, who lives with the abominable snowmen in the Sanaskar Mountains. In saving them from disaster he gets to grips with the tragedy in his own life. This is a thrilling and moving \"other world\" story that bears upon us all. </p> <p>If you're hooked on Friends, Jonathan Meres' <strong> Yo! Diary! 2</strong> (Piccadilly Press, \u00a35.99) is a must. Six teenagers in their individual styles spill their deepest secrets about themselves and reveal their views of each other. And we discover that we're not alone, that others have the same shames and fears and minor joys as we do. </p> <p><strong> super.activ Football</strong> by Clive Gifford (Hodder, \u00a33.99) is worth a season's training - a book packed with diagrams, drawings and insider writing on how to improve your game. Essential reading for every Premiership player. </p> <p> \u0095 Bernard Ashley's recent novel Little Soldier was shortlisted for the Guardian Children's Book Award and the Carnegie Medal. His latest book for teenagers is Playing Against the Odds, published by Barrington Stoke. The book charity Reading Is Fundamental is seeking role models who can get boys into the reading habit - not just well-known names, but fathers, grandfathers, brothers, teachers, librarians or anyone else who champions reading.

  "<p>David Beckham was welcomed by hordes of supporters at Boryspil airport yesterday and the defenders of Dynamo Kiev are sure to stick as close to him tonight. </p> <p>Anyone who saw him spraying 70-yard passes around Goodison Park on Saturday with a simplicity that suggested he might have been shelling peas would be willing to subscribe to the theory he is playing some of the best football of his career. </p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson volunteered the opinion last night that Beckham \"was playing as well as I can remember\", and from someone usually prone to keeping anything Beckham-related in-house such high praise is not proffered lightly. </p> <p>Any journalist displaying the temerity to mention Beckham's name within Ferguson's earshot over the past two years has usually been shot down with the type of impenetrable stare that could make mice jump into a trap. But, as United prepared for their first match inside the imposing Respublikanski stadium, his willingness to speak about Fleet Street's favourite play-thing is perhaps evidence that, after more indiscretions than he would care to remember, the Scot finally regards Beckham as having come of age. </p> <p>\"There comes a time when you reach an age of maturity and that's the period when you really look for players to shine. David is doing just that,\" he said. \"I can remember from my playing days that, when you reach that stage, when you feel in control, then everything is that much easier. </p> <p>\"David knows he can score more goals but he's already got three this season and, if he continues at this rate, he will be up around the 14 or 15 mark, which is what he is capable of. </p> <p>\"His hunger has always been there but it is not just that. He is very fit. Some players need more rest than others, but not him. He has a natural stamina to go with everything else.\" </p> <p>Dynamo, however, have a few star players of their own. Their midfielder Andrii Husin was last season's Ukraine player of the year and the Uzbek striker Maxim Shatskikh won Ukraine's golden boot and was named newcomer of the year. </p> <p>Since beating Arsenal two seasons ago they have sold arguably their two finest assets, Andrei Shevchencko to Milan and Sergei Rebrov to Tottenham, but Ferguson is adamant that Ukraine's flagship team will provide United's sternest examination of this first group stage. </p> <p>\"Kiev always seem to produce a great player who no one has heard of,\" he said. \"They are something of an unknown quantity and that's to our disadvantage. We don't know their players like we do with, say, Barcelona, Real Madrid or Juventus. That could work against us.\" </p> <p>Dynamo are certainly taking it seriously. Having won vischa liga by a record 18 points last season, scoring 85 goals while conceding only 18, they have been given special dispensation by the Ukraine Football Federation to postpone their league matches until October so that they can get a good start in the Champions League. </p> <p>Paradoxically, however, the lack of competitive action seemed to work against them last week when they led against PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands before succumbing to tired legs and losing 2-1. </p> <p>That result makes their need for victory here all the stronger and, judging by the number of ticket touts milling around yesterday, there should not be many empty spaces in their 83,500-capacity stadium. </p> <p>A back injury to Fabien Barthez, suffered against Everton on Saturday, saw Mark Bosnich reunited with United's first-team squad yesterday, although it will be Raimond van der Gouw who replaces the Frenchman in goal. Teddy Sheringham is likely to resume his partnership up front with Andy Cole.</p>",
  "<p>The feminisation of the BBC seems to be accelerating under director general Greg Dyke. The appointment of Lorraine Heggessey as controller of BBC1, the first woman to hold such a coveted and powerful post, is an obvious breakthrough. For the first time both BBC1 and BBC2 (Jane Root) have women controllers, while BBC Knowledge, the network to be revamped as a serious BBC4, is also run by Liz Cleaver. </p> <p>But women are also well represented among the powerful new layer of genre commissioners, who will advise channel controllers this autumn on which new dramas, entertainment, factual, and specialist programming and arts to back. </p> <p>They include Danielle Lux (entertainment), Nicola Moody (factual), Glenwyn Benson (specialist), and probably, Jane Tranter (drama). Roly Keating is the new arts supremo, while Nigel Pickard runs all children's programming and scheduling. They have real power because there is a \"dual key\" system: both commissioner and controller must agree. Also, with new quotas due to be announced for BBC producers, they wield power over what is made in-house as well as by independents.These executives have development funds for new projects on all networks, a key spending area. </p> <p>Also, within the past nine months, two of the three national regions have passed into the control of women, Menna Richards at BBC Wales (headhunted from HTV) and Anna Carragher, BBC Northern Ireland. Both are high profile leadership roles. In Wales Richards has already shaken up the structure and now has to revitalise production, especially for BBC1 which has been in the doldrums. In Northern Ireland there are continual political tensions requiring a trusted pair of hands. </p> <p>The national regions have been invited by Dyke to bid for extra funds made available by the slashing of bureaucracy: for example, to provide programmes for new regional digital services. </p> <p>In radio the tide turned with the appointment of Jenny Abramsky as director two years ago, but has continued with the decision to make Helen Boaden controller of Radio 4, another highly visible and coveted post. Kate Rowlands, as head of radio drama, has been charged with developing drama for both Radio 4 and Radio 3, as well as planning the forthcoming fiftieth anniversary of The Archers.</p> <p> It's a far cry from the last big shake up in 1996, when John Birt famously overlooked talented women, having previously driven away Liz Forgan. Only a year ago the dying days of the Birtist era favoured corporate bruisers such as Matthew Bannister, and drove away Jana Bennett, the executive who championed Walking with Dinosaurs, to the Discovery networks.</p>",
  "The farmer who spearheaded the first fuel tax protest today accused the chancellor, Gordon Brown, of trying to provoke further demonstrations. <p>Brynle Williams, who headed the six-day stand-off outside the Stanlow oil refinery in Cheshire, was reacting to the chancellor's rejection of the deadline imposed by protesters. </p> <p>The 51-year-old farmer described the chancellor's comments as \"antagonistic\" while a spokesman for the hauliers who blockaded the Shell terminal, at Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, said Mr Brown would be committing \"political suicide\" should he fail to act within 60 days. </p> <p>Mr Brown's defiant stance came as members of the government's new fuel task force sat down again to try to thrash out an agreement on how to secure supplies of petrol - and as a new poll showed Labour's support on the slide. </p> <p>Mr Williams said from his sheep and cattle farm in Cilcain, near Mold, north Wales: \"Gordon Brown is a very very silly man for making such an antagonistic public statement. </p> <p>\"The chancellor is trying to provoke a confrontation by saying he won't stick to our 60-day deadline. He wants to discredit us by provoking us into action before the 60 days is up and then turn round and say 'I told you so'. But I would appeal to the British public to maintain calm and give the man the benefit of the doubt.\" </p> <p>Mr Williams, vice-chairman of the Farmers' Union of Wales, added: \"I hope at the end of the 60 days he will show he has listened and responded. Mr Brown is like a cornered animal at the moment and is very dangerous; let's ensure he still has an escape route.\"</p> <p>Len Johnson, a spokesman for the hauliers who blockaded the Shell terminal at Jarrow, criticised Mr Brown for rejecting the protesters' deadline. </p> <p>\"It is political suicide if he does not do anything within the 60 days. It was a serious gesture and it was well thought about before it was made,\" he said. \"I am sure action will be taken if nothing happens. It would be different if he said 'let's get round the table and talk about it' and explain why he can't do anything within the 60 days.\" </p> <p>Mr Johnson expressed scepticism at the chancellor's claims that he was listening to the farmers and hauliers. \"He said he was listening to us years ago, but we have been demonstrating for the past two years now,\" he said. They have been trying to keep us sweet but we are not going to stand for it any more. We are wise to them now.\" </p> <p>The chancellor reiterated his hardline stance in an interview with the Times published today, in which he said: \"We are not going to make decisions on the basis of deadlines such as this. We have a process that works: the pre-Budget report and then the Budget.\" </p> <p>In an apparent rebuke to those colleagues calling for the government to be more responsive, he added: \"People do not want governments taking decisions because of something that has happened one week and changing their mind the next week.\" </p> <p>Three sub-committees were today trying again to determine how to keep petrol and diesel supplies flowing after yesterday's first full meeting of the government's fuel task force failed to reach agreement on either threatened new legislation to compel oil companies to keep supplies moving or a \"memorandum of understanding\". </p> <p>The toll the fuel crisis has taken on the government was underlined by a Guardian ICM poll which showed the Tories pulling further ahead of Labour. </p> <p>According to the survey, two-thirds of people blame the government for petrol price rises, and nearly three quarters say Labour is not a listening government. </p> <p>Mr Blair's personal satisfaction rating has plummeted from plus two in July to minus 34 now - the lowest rating for a Labour leader since Neil Kinnock's nadir of popularity in March 1989.</p>",
  "The chancellor, Gordon Brown, has insisted the government will not give in to petrol protesters and rejected demands for a quick cut in fuel duties. <p>His defiant stance came as the government's new fuel 'task force' began to try and thrash out an agreement on how to secure supplies of petrol. It also came just hours after a Guardian poll showed Labour's support was further on the slide.</p> <p>Mr Brown rejected the \"action in 60 days\" demands by protesters and said: \"We are not going to make decisions on the basis of deadlines such as this.

  "Bill Morris, leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union, yesterday called for a public inquiry into why oil companies and the police appeared to collude with protesters during last week's fuel blockades, warning the government against any knee-jerk resort to new legislation. <p>The TGWU, which represents the majority of employed tanker drivers and played a key role in helping to bring the blockades to an end, is preparing a dossier of evidence for Tony Blair, detailing company and police inaction or connivance with the anti-fuel tax protests. </p> <p>But Mr Morris, responding to suggestions that the government is planning legislation requiring oil companies to maintain fuel supplies, made clear that he had not been consulted and that his union would not tolerate any move to restrict the right to strike for tanker drivers. </p> <p>\"The government should investigate why existing legislation was not effective before they rush to implement new laws,\" he said. His members would be at the \"sharp end\" of the proposed legislation, which raised questions of civil rights and practicability. </p> <p>\"The roles of the police, the oil companies and the protesters all need to be investigated if we are to avoid blockades of this sort,\" he said, citing the failure of police to use \"their considerable public order powers to restore safety to the roads\". </p> <p>Reports from the union's tanker drivers' representatives, Mr Morris said, raised a questions about the blockades by owner drivers and farmers, including: </p> <p>\u0095 Why had protesters been given the run of restricted areas at Immingham depot near Hull when unions had been refused access, as they had at Fawley, to represent members? </p> <p>\u0095 Why, when protesters first appeared at the Stanlow depot in Cheshire and TGWU members working for P&amp;O told managers they would work normally if they were given police escorts, was no such support given? </p> <p>\u0095 Why did police take no action over film of drivers being threatened at Stanlow - some were told by demonstrators that their pictures would be posted on the internet. </p> <p>Mr Morris said BP had instructed TGWU drivers last week not to take tankers out - this in an industry ruthlessly quick to make wage deductions if drivers failed to carry out their contractual obligations. </p> <p>\"Why did the companies not invoke their contractual rights in getting deliveries out? </p> <p>\"Why didn't they take out injunctions? Why did the police not invoke the law of obstruction? Why was a convoy of trucks allowed to occupy all three lanes of the M11 travelling at less than 10mph?\" </p> <p>The TGWU is in a strong position to press its case with the government, not least because of the success of two of its officials, Danny Bryan, national officer for road transport, and Andy Smith, TGWU president, in persuading Grangemouth tanker drivers to resume supplies last Wednesday which helped to bring the blockades to an end.</p>",
  "Government plans to respond to last week's sudden petrol drought by imposing a new legal duty on oil companies to maintain supplies met fierce resistance from the companies and unions last night. <p>In an effort to quell union protests about a possible removal of the right to strike, the industry secretary, Stephen Byers, wrote to the TUC to reassure the unions that any legal duty to ensure continuous supply of petrol would be imposed on employers, and not on the tankers drivers or their unions. </p> <p>The petrol companies said the scheme was probably unworkable, adding they would not instruct their workforce to cross the protest lines if there was any perceived threat to their safety. They added many of the tanker drivers were not in their direct employment. </p> <p>The controversy arose after the first meeting of a task force of ministers, police and oil firms set up to prevent a repetition of last week's crisis. </p> <p>When asked if the fuel crisis will ever happen again, Jack Straw, the home secretary, replied: \"It is a very rash minister who says something will never happen again but what we are working on is a very significant reduction of the risk of this kind of disruptive action.\" </p> <p>Ministers have said they want to extend the powers in the Energy Act 1976 which gives the government the right to order or regulate the supply of crude liquid petroleum, gas and electricity. Under this act ministers can ask the courts to impose unlimited fines on gas and electricity companies that fail to meet requirements to maintain supplies. </p> <p>Cabinet ministers said the oil companies were being much more constructive than expected, but added a general legal duty would put extra pressure to rearrange the supply chain. </p> <p>However, some of the oil companies pointed out that if no legal duty is placed on tanker drivers to work, there is no effective leverage on the companies to supply petrol. </p> <p>A legal duty already exists on oil companies to keep a fixed level of oil reserves in Britain, or abroad under bilateral agreements with foreign governments. </p> <p>Mr Straw said prior to any legislation, likely to be included in the Queen's speech, the government and oil firms would draw up a non-legal memorandum of understanding setting out each side's duties and responsibilities. </p> <p>The task force is in the short term to be split into three sub-committees - the first covering the potential legal duties on petrol suppliers, a second covering the degree of coordination between the oil firms, the police and Whitehall, and a third ensuring that Whitehall is able to respond to any emergency better by guaranteeing supply to essential users. </p> <p>Ministers also want the task force to look at redistributing petrol supplies into local depots, ending the concentration of the entire reserves in a small number of refineries. The companies are also to be asked to look at bringing tanker drivers back into direct employment. At present many are sub-contracted, or self-employed. </p> <p>Mr Straw said he had received detailed reports from the task force about the level of intimidation received by the truck drivers. \"What is incontrovertible is the truck drivers did feel intimidated and that the oil companies themselves logged a series of incidents of intimidation.\" </p> <p>Downing Street admitted that it will not seek to impose its new laws before the 60-day deadline imposed by the hauliers for a cut in fuel duty. Ministers have been told the overspill session is already so full it could not contemplate introducing emergency legislation this autumn. </p> <p>Some of the leading figures in last week's ad hoc protest are expected to meet with the Road Haulage Association on Thursday to discuss tactics. </p> <p>Roger King, chief executive of the RHA, warned the government was very foolish to signal plans for emergency powers. It was setting a deadline to road hauliers by which they would have to take further action. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' leader Charles Kennedy accused the government of a lack of candour during the crisis which had undermined public confidence and challenged it to create a new fuel policy which is both fair and \"upfront\" about its environmental goals. </p> <p>In an emergency statement at the start of the Liberal Democrats' annual conference he urged ministers to freeze fuel taxes in real terms for five years; to use the VAT windfall gained through higher world prices to improve public transport; to ensure that the oil companies \"recognise their social responsibilities both in respect of pricing and security of supply\" or face punitive tax penalties; and to provide special help for car-dependent rural areas though tax breaks on petrol stations or better community transport. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy told delegates in Bournemouth that the mutual consent necessary to the workings of a \"fundamentally decent country\" like Britain's had come close to breaking down last week. </p> <p>Oil companies said that petrol was being delivered to almost all of their stations but panic buying had forced several to close again. </p> <p>An estimated 12 Jet stations had been forced to close a spokesman said. \"Everyone's running very hard to catch up and queues have certainly calmed down. Buying patterns are now edgy to normal.\" </p> <p>BP said it had opened 90% of its 1,500 stations but anticipated that several would be forced to shut again because deliveries were not meeting demand. However, a spokeswoman said that stations are now quieter than at the weekend.It estimated that stations would return to normal within two weeks. </p> <p>Shell expects to have all its 1,044 stations open today. Stationsreported \"extensive queuing\" despite 230 more trucks delivering fuel yesterday than is usual for a Monday, a spokesman said. </p> <p>Two thirds of Esso stations - the company with the most garages - are open. A spokeswoman said petrol was delivered at 140% of the normal rate over the weekend.\"Some sites are going to be running lower but we are trying to ensure that the spread is even.\" </p> <p>About 200 schools in England were closed yesterday as a result of fuel shortages, the Department for Education and Employment said.

The visit to the state where his brother Jeb is governor, and which most strategists originally put in the Republican camp, shows how strongly Mr Gore is doing in the battleground states. </p> <p>With some polls showing Mr Gore threatening to take a dominant lead, Mr Bush launched a \"Blueprint for the Middle Class\", a 16-page summary of his policy proposals, and began highlighting his new slogan: \"Real Plans for Real People.\" </p> <p>\"It's a real plan. It isn't one of those things with a lot of fine print in it. It's a real plan to help families help themselves,\" he said before going on to Missouri and Illinois. </p> <p>The move is a calculated risk, since the polls that show Mr Gore leading also show him well ahead on most of the issues the Republicans want to highlight. But Mr Bush has come under fierce pressure from within his party to focus on themes that the voters repeatedly say matter most to them. </p> <p>The most recent polls differ about the extent of Mr Gore's lead, but there is no disagreement about the fact that, after months of seeming to be on course for victory, Mr Bush is struggling to prevent the vice-president succeeding Bill Clinton on November 7. </p> <p>The latest Newsweek poll shows Mr Gore with a 50% to 38% lead among registered voters, and a 52% to 38% advantage among likely voters - the biggest leads he has had in any national poll since the candidates began their campaigns for the White House more than two years ago. </p> <p>Other polls show Mr Gore with only a single-figure lead, but all demonstrate that he is widening the gap. A new Harris Interactive survey gives Mr Gore a 46% to 43% lead, while the latest Gallup three-day tracking poll shows him at 49%, against Mr Bush's 41%. The Green candidate, Ralph Nader, is on 3%, and Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party has 1%. </p> <p>As well as reining back Mr Gore, Mr Bush particularly needs to stop the erosion of his lead among male voters. The latest Gallup figures show that this lead among men has fallen from 20 points two weeks ago to just three points. Mr Gore leads strongly among women voters. </p> <p>Gore advisers dismissed the Bush relaunch as \"pictures and no substance, reflective of a campaign that's all imagery and no ideas\". So confident are they, they issued a cheeky rebuttal yesterday of part of Mr Bush's agenda. Under the heading \"Bush's child care and pre-school proposals\", the press release from the Gore campaign consisted of a blank sheet of paper. </p>",
  "The Liberal Democrats voted overwhelmingly for a change in the law to recognise gay partnerships yesterday - but sought to quench middle England fears by denying that they were advocating gay marriages. <p>With a clear eye on wooing disillusioned Tory voters, Susan Kramer, the Liberal Democrats' unsuccessful London mayoral candidate, told delegates at the party's conference in Bournemouth: \"I do stress this is not a proposal for gay marriage. That is another debate.\" </p> <p>What the party was proposing was a \"civil partnership\" as applicable to heterosexual couples who chose to live together but not marry, as to gay and lesbian couples. </p> <p>Ms Kramer said the proposal would allow any two unrelated people over 16 in England and Wales the legal benefits afforded to married people in areas such as pensions, inheritance, tax and social security. </p> <p>She had met with initial opposition, but had cited the example of the gay partner of one of the Soho nailbomber's victims, who received no compensation , unlike the husband of another victim. </p> <p>People who \"call themselves middle England\" and who would not normally be advocates of gay rights had told her it was not fair. </p> <p>Other delegates sought to repair the potential damage to their courtship of the Tory vote - which saw them win the Romsey byelection in May - by headlines on \"gay marriages\". </p> <p>Baroness Sarah Ludford, MEP for London and head of the Liberal Democrat group in the European parliament, said it was right the \"landmark motion\" should not refer to gay marriages since it was important to recognise the \"genuine sensitivities\" of those who felt marriage was an institution which must have a \"reserved status\". </p> <p>Dr Evan Harris, MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, insisted the move was not about forcing, or even asking, Christians to marry somebody of the same sex. </p> <p>\"We are just asking them to allow other people the sort of equality and freedom that they would expect for themselves,\" he said. </p> <p>The motion - which was carried almost unanimously - calls for ministers to consult on a scheme for civil partnerships and makes the Liberal Democrats the first mainstream British party to advocate such a policy. </p> <p>William Hague emphatically rejected the idea of gay marriages last month after the Tory vice-chairman, Steven Norris, backed the deal. Labour has \"no firm proposals on this issue\", a spokesman said last night. </p> <p>But, while it may have appeared radical, one delegate, Sue Vincent from Reigate, condemned the motion for not going far enough. </p> <p>\"It entrenches discrimination against gay couples by not offering them the option of civil marriage. </p> <p>\"Heterosexuals have three options: marriage, cohabitation or civil partnership. Lesbian and gay couples will only have two options.\" </p> <p>But the vote was welcomed by the gay pressure group Stonewall, which said it hoped other parties would take note. </p> <p>Spokesman Sebastian Sands said he was \"very pleased\" the party had shied away from the phrase \"gay marriage\". \"We don't think the word marriage is helpful. It has connotations that are not appropriate. </p> <p>\"It's not the religious aspect that we think is important, it's the practical aspects - inheritance, pensions, succession of tenancy, and the credibility that relationships are given.\"</p>",
  "The emptiest demand this weekend was for the recall of parliament. Parliament would appear to be the problem not the solution. This should not be so, but it is so. Two thousand people decided they had a more potent voice from their strategically positioned lorry-cabs and deck-chairs than a dozen Gladstones, were there any to be heard, could have delivered in the Commons. They were right. Recalling parliament would have been, I regret to say, an exercise in sentiment not pragmatism, the whinnying of asses after the stable had burned down. <p>Some of the reasons for this may be transient. A government with a huge majority does not need to pay attention. Only small majorities bring big listening. This was as true of Thatcher 1983 as it is of Blair 2000. But other features of parliament's recession are systemic to modern British democratic politics: the intransigent whipping, the scorn for independence, the power of machines, the near-impossible task facing a backbench MP who wants to influence a government decision. Few if any MPs are seen as speaking fearlessly for their people. If collections of them purport to do so, they're cast into the salon of those self-excluded from serious society. </p> <p>This neutering of the elected politician, which gets more not less severe, has happened in parallel with changes in the electorate. They reinforce the process, deepening alienation from the system in which parliamentary politicians operate. Voters are better educated than they were. They know more, as media outlets proliferate. They're harder to fob off with fancy claims. They're less deferential to leaders of all kinds, less willing to believe in anyone or anything, less chained by prior ideological allegiance. Their impatience grows as their loyalties diminish. </p> <p>Modern technology, moreover, offers them alternatives to mere cynicism. They don't need parties in order to mobilise. The mobile phone is stronger than a thousand envelopes. Before long, internet polling could be producing a critical mass of uncontrollable energy, putting millions of voters behind causes that conventional politicians prefer to bury. Here we have the makings of an era of direct democracy, last week being the most pointed British shot so far. </p> <p>It was an ugly beginning. The absence of violence against the person doesn't mean there was no violence against the system. Who the hell are these people to give the government 60 days? Why should a bunch of farmers, already cushioned to the last gallon of diesel against the realities of the market, hold a gun to the country's head? Haulier hubris had a fascist undertone. If direct democracy is the coming thing, let it at least have more representative origins than this. </p> <p>On the other hand, it should force politicians to come cleaner. The act of violence against the system posed questions more starkly than the blurry mediations of representative democracy. Fleeting though Labour's plummet may prove to be, the popular response confirmed by today's Guardian opinion poll registers how wide the impatience runs. What voters want, as they empower themselves directly, is action more than promises, substance more than tone, alertness to their present mood not just the five-yearly test of it at the ballot box. </p> <p> I n a recent book, The New Prince, Dick Morris, Clinton's one-time lead consultant, proposes a major lesson to be taken from this shift, which in America is further advanced than here. The day of spin is done, says Morris, who was one of spin's creators. What voters want are issues, on which politicians must take positions. Attack ads, personality stuff, feel-good images: all these, he says, will fail to build durable support among an informed, watchful, demanding electorate which distrusts all intermediaries with a severity unimaginable 20 years ago. </p> <p>\"A political leader should take the temperature and monitor the pulse of the times in which he lives,\" Morris concedes. He must align his style with the public mood. But the update Morris now gives on 15 years of such manipulation on Clinton's behalf is that the new voters want choices between measures rather than men. They now care more about issues than froth, about policy not morality. \"When a candidate takes an issue position in the thick of controversy, voters feel that is the most reliable indicator they have of his true essence.\" George W Bush is suddenly trying to make the switch, away from the politics of cuteness, to retrieve his lagging campaign. It has relevance to post-blockade Britain. Voters alienated from the charades of parliament are saying by their discontent that they want less spin, less dissembling, more honesty, more principle. </p> <p>Labour stood up for principle by not caving in to haulier menaces. This clear position may yet reap benefits, as the petrol crisis fades and more people understand what was at stake. But Mr Blair seems determined not to make much of it. Even during the blockade he was anxious to define no one as an enemy. He has discovered how few friends he made by such restraint. We see that the magic of his personality is no longer his matchless political weapon. Though he remains irreplaceable in the leadership, in the country he must now depend on more than shallow charisma. </p> <p>This is a good not a bad development. Charisma was always the least of it. The shock of last week should take Labour to the honest heart of its political argument. Of the follies committed by ministers, none was more absurd than the pretence that Britain did not have a high tax on petrol. Cut such nonsense, says the voter. Defend your strategy. Come clean about the society you want, high tax and all. Make the case for the fuel tax, and for the public services it pays for. Respect the public's mood, and understand their lives. But doing things by stealth finishes up insulting a well-informed electorate. </p> <p>If direct action awakens that kind of apprehension, it will have been a therapy. Can it do the same for William Hague? Though the Conservatives have momentarily benefited from the crisis, their predicament is deeper. They've appeared to have no principles as regards democracy. Though Hague called for parliament to come back, he also called the enemies of elected democrats \"fine upstanding people\". The opportunism of a desperate man has seldom been more obvious. </p> <p>That's only the beginning. If Labour's taxes are stealthy, the Tories' cuts skulk in clandestine mendacity. Their low-tax society, trumpeted again yesterday, builds on what they see as these new seismic signals. But all they dare talk about is waste, the last refuge of the oppositionist scoundrel. They daren't describe honestly the society they want, falling back instead on the politics of Mr Blair's personality. In the post-parliamentary era, people demand more than that. It's the only good lesson from the barricades. </p> <p> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a> </p> <p>\u0095 Dick Morris, The New Prince, is published by Renaissance Books, Los Angeles</p>",
  "<p>\"The most powerful man in Europe\" is how Mario Monti, the European competition commissioner, describes his sparky predecessor, Karel van Miert. And the mild-mannered Italian academic believes this is not time to shrink from the mantle he inherited. </p> <p>Mr Monti is poised to launch a series of sweeping reforms to strengthen the commission's anti-cartel powers, a move that will see him acquire unprecedented authority to conduct investigations. </p> <p>The one-time professor of monetary theory at Bocconi university is also turning his attention to the internet and yesterday served notice that, as one of the world's most powerful regulators, he would be more and more involved in ensuring the sector does not become the preserve of a few mega-corporations such as Microsoft. A \"wait and see approach\" cuts no ice with him and he intends to regulate the sector \"on the basis of what we know now\". </p> <p>Ensuring that no one company controls the internet's infrastructure, be it global backbone networks or more modest local networks, is to be one of his top priorities. The danger, he believes, is that such control can be used to gain an unfair advantage in related markets. </p> <p>Telecoms groups MCI/Worldcom and Sprint, which this year planned the mother of all tie-ups, discovered Mr Monti's views on the subject the hard way. The multi-billion dollar deal spectacularly collapsed after he gave it the thumbs down and yesterday he spelled out why: \"It is a truism to say that the more users there are connected to telecoms networks, the more valuable that network becomes. The corollary of this, however, is that the more important the network becomes, the greater the risk that competition problems will emerge.\" </p> <p>The restricted nature of set-top TV boxes, Microsoft's alleged refusal to dis close vital information about its PC operating systems and online business exchanges are other issues Mr Monti is carefully tracking. </p> <p>In all three cases, he said yesterday, there is a risk that a handful of companies will gain too dominant a position. </p> <p>The quiet Italian has shown he is ready to get tough with the world's mega-corporations. He said no last year to a merger between Airtours and First Choice Holidays and he has blocked a merger between truck makers Volvo and Scania. He is good at getting his own way as Fifa and Uefa have discovered to their cost regarding football transfer rules. </p> <p>Despite his sober demeanour, Mr Monti has a taste for a catchy phrase as befits a former columnist for Corriere della Sera. So he peppers his speeches with talk of \"hardcore cartels\" and \"cancers on the open market economy\" to justify his view that his powers are inadequate. </p> <p>In future, and provided Mr Monti's reforms are approved by EU governments, the EC will work far more closely with national competition authorities and create a powerful network that will allow evidence of cartels to be freely exchanged across borders. Brussels will concentrate on sniffing out the really serious cartels and spend less time looking into small-scale anti-competitive behaviour. </p> <p>Its powers of investigation will also be strengthened. At the moment Mr Monti's investigators only have the power to search companies' premises but in future they will, for the first time, be authorised to search private homes. </p> <p>\"Cartels are cancers on the open market economy, which forms the very basis of our community,\" he said recently. \"Moreover, since by nature cartels are secret and therefore difficult to uncover, it is likely that what we are seeing is only the tip of the iceberg. In the words of Adam Smith there is a tendency for competitors to conspire. I am determined to strengthen our fight against cartels.\" </p> <p>Brussels's powers to levy fines against companies that drag their feet are also set to increase dramatically and Mr Monti is pushing for \"substantial\" fines based on a percentage of annual turnover rather than the current system of relatively small fixed amounts. In short, Mr Monti, who has acquired a reputation for being a tough operator, is just about to get even tougher. </p> <p>He has also announced that he intends to step up cooperation with anti-trust bodies across the world and make \"second generation\" agreements with the United States and others. His team of competition experts in Brussels, which numbers about 80 people and is widely regarded as understaffed, will also be increased. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Mr Monti, who is still remembered for killing off duty-free shopping in his last job in charge of the EU's single market, is making few friends among those who fear a more powerful regulator with almost limitless powers.</p>",
  "Very tall and burly, Baron Erroll of Hale, who has died aged 86, was among the most successful and popular engineer-politician-industrialists of his generation. Although he reached his political peak under Harold Macmillan, as president of the Board of Trade (1961-63), he thought he did better as minister for power (1963-64), to which post Sir Alec Douglas-Home demoted him. There, he rushed through the Continental Shelf Bill to allow the oil companies speedily to explore the North Sea and thus \"dish Labour\". <p>When the Tories were defeated in 1964, he was rewarded with a hereditary barony. After that, he led the Tories in little-reported Lords economic, industrial and foreign trade debates. Last year he was one of the 92 elected by fellow hereditaries to survive as life peers in the transitional House of Lords. </p> <p>Outside politics, Erroll was an even greater success as an industrialist. He was chairman of Bowater, Consolidated Gold Fields and Whessoe and a leading figure in the CBI, the Institute of Directors and the London Chamber of Commerce. He led successful trade delegations to south-east Asia and Latin America, and penetrated the Iron Curtain, meeting Nikita Krushchev and Chou En-lai. </p> <p>A complex background enabled Erroll to bridge the class gap. Born in London, he was the son of mechanical engineer George Erroll, who had come south from Glasgow and shed his German-sounding name of Bergmans. Earlier family roots were in Rotterdam. Freddy's father also managed to send him to Oundle. After that, in 1931, he was apprenticed at Metropolitan-Vickers, then an engineering giant in the Manchester suburbs. His public schoolboy polish helped him become chairman of the largely leftwing apprentices association, and he obtained a mechanical sciences degree at Trinity College, Cambridge. </p> <p>Already in the Territorials, he was commissioned in the 4th County of London Yeomanry at the outbreak of war in 1939, transferring to the tank division of the Ministry of Supply in 1940. He wound up a full colonel in Mountbatten's Southeast Asia Command, as technical adviser on armoured fighting vehicles, and took part in SEAC's first amphibious operations. </p> <p>Labour's 1945 tidal wave did not touch him as the safe Tory candidate for Altrincham and Sale, and, once in the Commons, he became a militant voice for business and Tory virtues, attacking nationalisation and food subsidies. He also wanted better pay for industrial brains, so that senior executives could think in the evenings rather than wash dishes. </p> <p>Having turned down previous offers after the Tories' comeback in 1951 in favour of more remunerative directorships, Erroll's first ministerial job was as parliamentary secretary for supply in Eden's 1955 government, and he held the same rank at the Board of Trade (1956-58), before becoming economic secretary to the Treasury (1958-59). Transferred to the Board of Trade under Reginald Maudling in 1959, he took over command in 1961. He survived Macmillan's 1962 purge, but did not shine, mainly because he was caught in the Tory party struggle between big business and smaller entrepreneurs. </p> <p>Sir Alec Douglas-Home made him minister for power, although Erroll had conspired with Enoch Powell and Iain Macleod to block Home's selection as leader by the Tory inner circle. After the 1964 Tory defeat, Erroll, who had been warned by his doctor to take things easy, turned over his safe seat to Anthony Barber. </p> <p>After his recovery, he was much sought after by big business. As chairman of Bowater's, the paper giant, he battled with Harold Wilson over his industries bill. As chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields, he fought off takeover attempts by South African billionaire Harry Oppenheimer. As chairman of a Home Office committee (1970-72), he urged more flexible licensing hours and a lower drinking age of 17. </p> <p>He never lost his sense of humour; until the end, editors loved to reproduce his brief, jokey letters, usually in answer to others' gripes. </p> <p>He married Elizabeth Barrow in 1950. Since there were no children, the barony lapses. </p> <p>\u0095Frederick James Erroll, Baron Erroll of Hale, politician and industrialist, born May 27 1914; died September 14 2000</p>",
  "It has been said of the publisher Jerzy Giedroyc, who has died aged 94, that he saved Polish literature from extinction during his country's long night of communism, and even if the claim is a little exaggerated, few Poles would quibble. <p>He was born in a town known as Minsk Litewski when it was part of Poland, and as Mensk, now that it is the capital of Belarus. But he was educated in Warsaw, where his father was a functionary in the city courts, attending the Jan Zamoyski lyc\u00e9e and then Warsaw University, where he read law. On graduating in 1929, he took a job in the Polish ministry of agriculture, moving, in 1935, to trade and industry. He continued his intellectual interests, taking a university history course in his spare time. </p> <p>Giedroyc had tried his hand at publishing a student magazine, and in 1930, while still a civil servant, launched a periodical called The Rebellion Of Youth, which in 1936 changed its name to Polityka. It was a left-of-centre, anti-communist publication, which stirred up controversy with pieces by extremists of various hues, and showing an unfashionable interest in events in countries such as Lithuania and the Ukraine. </p> <p>When the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939, Giedroyc escaped to Romania, where he offered his services as private secretary to the Polish ambassador, and then as agent for Polish affairs at the British embassy. In March 1941, he left Bucharest for the Middle East, where he joined the Polish army, serving with the Highland Rifle Brigade in Libya and fighting at Tobruk. </p> <p>When his unit moved to Palestine, Giedroyc was given the job of publishing the Polish 2nd Corps journal. After a brief stint in the ministry of information of the Polish government in London, he returned to Rome, where, at the beginning of 1946, he embarked on a course that was to turn him into a living institution. </p> <p>Unlike many of his colleagues, who believed that tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States would lead to another war and liberate eastern Europe, Giedroyc was convinced that a long period of exile lay ahead. In the belief that Polish emigr\u00e9s would need literary and ideological sustenance, he opened a publishing house, which, in its first year, produced more than 30 books, mostly classics. In June 1947, he also launched a periodical, Kultura, which became the most important Polish publication of its kind - and remained so until his death. </p> <p>Later that year, Giedroyc moved the whole enterprise to Maisons-Laffitte, near Paris, where an aristocratic wellwisher had helped him acquire a large, and once handsome, suburban villa. In this improbable setting, Giedroyc got down to work in earnest on Kultura, a thick monthly packed with essays, narrative and polemic. He was assisted by Zygmunt Hertz and his wife, Zofia - he a sensible Sancho Panza to the quixotic Giedroyc, she the tireless copy editor and cook - and supported by the bohemian aristocratic painter, Jozef Czapski. Early editorial meetings tended to be held in the kitchen, the only warm room in the house, but the literary results were astonishing. </p> <p>Kultura provided a forum for the many Polish writers whom the war, or subsequent political events, had left stranded around the world, cut off from their readership and their raison d'etre. It thus gave back a voice to the likes of Witold Gombrowicz, Czeslaw Milosz and Gustaw Herling-Grudzinski. Giedroyc also kept in touch with writers still in Poland, printing works they could not get past the communist censors. Maisons-Laffitte soon became an international nerve-centre through which Polish literary life pulsated. </p> <p>Given Giedroyc's long-standing interest in areas east of Poland, and his sense of solidarity with the peoples of other countries under Soviet domination, it was not long before he began publishing the works of Russian and other east European writers, and his imprint began to sneak its way into the Soviet Union. </p> <p>In 1953, Giedroyc began publishing books again, producing some 500 titles over the next four decades; these tended to be new works by living authors, including Siniavsky and Solzhenitsyn, as well as major Polish writers. In 1962, he launched the twice-yearly Historical Notebooks, devoted to publishing source material and testimonial accounts of events in eastern Europe, which proved a vital source of information on what was going on. </p> <p>Life at Maisons-Laffitte was a daily struggle against bankruptcy. The quest for funds was not helped by Giedroyc's almost obsessive independence. He would not espouse any single literary set, and frequently annoyed his contributors by publishing material by writers of opposing literary cliques. Nor would he toe any political line, and his contacts with writers living in communist Poland annoyed the London government in exile, which boycotted everything from behind the Iron Curtain. </p> <p>But the quality of his publications spoke for him, as did his dedication to the cause, and a steady trickle of donations, most of them pathetically small sums eked out of desultory pensions, helped to keep the enterprise afloat. This, in itself, was an extraordinary achievement; many other emigr\u00e9 publishing ventures collapsed in heaps of heavily-accented newsprint. </p> <p>Loathed and denounced by the Polish and Soviet governments, which even leaned on the French authorities to close down his venture, Giedroyc was idolised by the Polish intelligentsia, and by many Russians, Byelorussians, Ukrainians and Lithuanians. He was a member of the editorial committee of the Russian dissident publication Kontinent, and an adviser to other groups, who treasured his experience and judgment. </p> <p>Giedroyc was, in many ways, an unlikely hero in Polish terms, and, for all the cloak-and-dagger stuff involved in spiriting manuscripts, microfilms and books in and out of the Soviet bloc, there was nothing flamboyant about this poised, self-possessed chain-smoker. His sense of mission was discreetly worn, and he appeared to many of his compatriots as rather English in his manner. </p> <p>He surprised all but his closest friends when, following the victory of 1989, he refused to return to Poland and declined all official honours. He knew he needed no distinction. His life and work are a sufficient monument, and stand as a stirring testimony to the power of the printed word. </p> <p>\u0095Jerzy Giedroyc, publisher, born July 27 1906; died September 14 2000</p>",
  "<p>The US equal employment opportunities commissioner, Paul Miller, has called for tougher safeguards for workers against genetic discrimination after it emerged that hundreds of people have already lost their jobs or insurance protection as a direct result of advances in genetic screening. </p> <p>\"Just as it is illegal to refuse to hire an individual because of their race or gender, it should be illegal to make job decisions based solely upon genetic information without considering that person's ability to do the work,\" Mr Miller wrote in an article in the University of Maryland's Journal of Health Care Law &amp; Policy. </p> <p>\"It is simply bad science for an employer to use the presence of a predictive genetic trait or marker to make workplace decisions, because those traits cannot predict how well that person will succeed in the workplace.\" </p> <p>Civil rights activists are growing concerned that if such Orwellian practices develop at the same pace as the race to decipher the human blueprint they could create a \"genetic underclass\" considered unemployable because of the chemical codes they carry inside them. </p> <p><strong> 'Flaws' cost jobs</strong><br> </p> <p> In a recent survey carried out by the Shriver centre for public health in Massachusetts, doctors and genetic testing centres reported 582 cases of people who were turned down for jobs or health insurance because of \"flaws\" discovered in their genes. </p> <p>Another watchdog organisation, the Council for Responsible Genetics (CRG), says it has documented more than 200 cases of genetic discrimination by employers. </p> <p>Researchers believe these figures are the tip of an iceberg. In most cases the corporations involved are not keen to publicise their practices, and nor are the victims, anxious to avoid further stigmatisation. In the cases cited by the genetics council the victims are not referred to by their full names. </p> <p>They include Kim, a social worker, who mentioned at a staff workshop that her mother had died of Huntington's disease, giving her a 50% chance of developing the potentially fatal genetic condition. A week later she was dismissed. </p> <p>In another case a 40-year-old woman with an exemplary employment record agreed to take part in a genetic research survey and tested positive for BRAC1, a gene linked to some breast and ovarian cancers. Despite having preventive surgery she lost her health insurance and then her job. </p> <p>Mr Miller is calling for new federal legislation to close the legal loopholes that allow employers and insurance companies to gain access to genetic information on prospective employees and use that information in hiring and firing. </p> <p>An attempt to get Congress to pass an anti-discrimination law - led by the Democratic leader in the Senate, Tom Daschle - has been blocked by the opposition of the insurance industry and the corporate lobby in Washington. </p> <p>Watching the bill being shelved until next year at the earliest, the senator warned: \"We simply cannot afford to take one step forward in science while taking two steps backwards in civil rights.\" </p> <p>The scientists leading the race to decode the human genome - like the physicists before them who first split the atom - also know the dangers that are inherent in their mission. </p> <p>As the first draft of the human genome map was unveiled to a great fanfare in June one of its principal authors, Francis Collins, director of National Human Genome Research Institute, said: \"Already, with but a handful of genetic tests in common use, people have lost their jobs, lost their health insurance and lost their economic well-being due to the unfair and inappropriate use of genetic information.\" </p> <p><strong> Records unprotected</strong><br> </p> <p> Recent research has found that the fear of future discrimination can be as damaging as discrimination itself, as people forgo screening for potentially treatable conditions for fear the information will be used against them in the future. </p> <p>A study by Georgetown University in Washington found that fear of discrimination has led one in 10 people at risk deciding against testing for genetic traits linked to cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, colon cancer and other conditions with a hereditary link. </p> <p>The US department of labour has found that many women are avoiding breast cancer screening because they believe a positive finding would go on their medical records and become available to employers or insurers. </p> <p>Their fears are justified in an unregulated market, where medical data are often treated as a tradable commodity, bought and sold by medical centres and insurance companies.

  "Omagh's senior police chief yesterday made an impassioned defence of the RUC's actions as it struggled to clear the centre of the Co Tyrone town when the first of three confused warning calls came less than half an hour before the car bomb blast which killed 29 people. <p>As the inquest into the August 1998 atrocity again heard terrible details of the aftermath of the explosion, Superintendent William Baxter said only the Real IRA, which planted the 500lb car bomb, could have saved any of the victims. </p> <p>He revealed there had since been 68 hoax bomb alerts in the town. </p> <p>The last was last Wednesday, when Martha Pope, the same codeword used in the worst massacre of Northern Ireland's conflict, was given. </p> <p>It had taken officers 42 minutes to clear the town centre last week. They had only 29 minutes to do so two years ago, and the inquest has heard there was confusion about the location of the device, leading officers mistakenly to shepherd people towards it. </p> <p>Supt Baxter told the inquest: \"The only people who could have made any difference were those who planted that car bomb and who made the phone calls relating to it. </p> <p>\"They had the power to say that the bomb was outside Kells's shop in Market Street. They had the power to give the colour of the car, the make and the registration number, but they didn't do that. </p> <p>\"Every one of my officers put their lives at risk to protect this community. But unfortunately it was not to be. The bombers planted their device on the busiest shopping day of the year. The persons who planted this bomb got out of the car and saw women and children on the street and they walked away. They did absolutely nothing to try to prevent people being murdered that day.\" </p> <p>Supt Baxter, calling it impossible to check 180 shops, 150 cars, and hundreds of shoppers, in 29 minutes, said the RUC had a code of practice. </p> <p>But he told Michael Mansfield QC, representing one family, there were no specific procedures for evacuating Omagh. </p> <p>He said: \"I would not give rigid orders to my officers. Terrorists have often planted secondary devices to catch out police officers. If I told my men exactly where they should be every time there was a bomb warning, I could be directing them to their deaths.\" </p> <p>An army doctor earlier told the inquest how a medic with him collapsed when he turned over the body of a heavily pregnant woman, only to find her 18-month-old daughter dead underneath. </p> <p>Samuel Potter told of the unnamed colleague's reaction as he moved Avril Monaghan, 30, pregnant with twin girls, only to find baby Maura underneath. Mrs Monaghan's mother, Mary Grimes, 65, was also among the 29 victims of the Real IRA bomb. </p> <p>Captain Potter told coroner John Leckey: \"I turned the body of the mother over and found the baby. It is totally burned into my memory for ever. It was so shocking that the medic with me collapsed.\" </p> <p>Captain Potter said the mother and her baby, one of her four children, were found on the street outside the remains of Kells's drapery shop. </p> <p>A police officer had earlier suggested the mother and her baby were elsewhere and apart. But Mr Leckey said he was confident after hearing from Captain Potter that his was the correct version. </p> <p>Under questioning from Barry Fox, for the Monaghan family, Captain Potter described the child he found with Mrs Monaghan as between 15 to 20 months old, and partially clothed. </p> <p>Mr Fox said: \"That is very important because, obviously, the child died with her mother. It is important for the relatives of those killed to know where their loved ones were exactly.\" </p> <p>Captain Potter earlier told the inquest he had pronounced life extinct on 20 bodies and one body part at the scene of the explosion over a 40-minute period. </p> <p>Asked how he came to his findings, Captain Potter said: \"I was looking for bodies with injuries that were survivable and obviously if a body had no head, then I didn't check for signs of life.\" </p> <p>Robert Bonar, 63, told how he had seen the Monaghans \"badly mutilated and covered in muck and debris\". He had searched for survivors for more than an hour after the blast. </p> <p>Mr Bonar said: \"I saw one young girl about 14 to 15 sitting on the ground holding the hand of one of the dead girls.\" When he asked her what she was doing, she had replied: \"I'm just holding her hand.\" </p> <p>The inquest continues.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Boys who like boys who like...</strong><br> On Monday, Dennis Cooper will be at Horse Hospital, Colonnade, WC1 plugging his new book, Period. Who? you might just be asking, unless your taste in literature runs to drug-addled, S&amp;M-packed, serial killer-drenched glibly amoral queerlit pitched somewhere between Bret Easton Ellis and Burroughs, and obsessed with late 80s noisepop. In which case, Cooper must be the only author you read. Anyway, Cooper's presence in London is intriguing because his last book, Guide, featured lurid fantasies about (resolutely straight) Blur bassist and occasional Soho barperson Alex James. Which means it would be worth popping along to the reading just in case Alex, whose escalating weight is surely compromising his status as a gay lust-object anyway, decides to make an appearance. </p> <p><strong> Gross international product...</strong><br> When your once pioneering brand of stomach-churning cinema has been crudely trumped by pretty much everyone in sight, then perhaps the only thing to do is retreat to the far side of Offa's Dyke.

The Fall. And that's this week's fun in the bag. </p>",
  "<p>I rarely watch sitcoms. I was also extremely rude about Robert Lindsay's Richard III two years ago, comparing his performance for the Royal Shakespeare Company to Ken Dodd capering before a Palladium audience. Lindsay was sufficiently irked to go on radio and retaliate, to liken Stratford to a \"theme park\" and to suggest he would in future forswear the classical stage. So the prospect of meeting him to discuss his new BBC sitcom, My Family, filled me with a certain dread. In the event, he turned out to be an absolute charmer. </p> <p>Lindsay's theatre career has had some spectacular highs as well as some unforeseen lows. He cut a dash at Manchester's Royal Exchange, not least as Hamlet and D'Artagnan. His three-year stint in Me and My Girl, in the West End and on Broadway, earned him a coveted Tony award; less happily, it led to a disastrous Carl Reiner movie musical, Bert Rigby, You're a Fool, which he claims \"was so depressingly awful it almost ruined my life\". But on television Lindsay has long been a bankable star, and he has struck up a particularly fruitful association with Alan Bleasdale, starring in GBH, Jake's Progress and, most recently, Oliver Twist. </p> <p>Why, though, given he is in constant demand, go back to sitcom for the first time since Citizen Smith? Kitted out in naval officer's uniform for a new Hornblower series shooting at Pinewood, Lindsay explained what lured him into six episodes of My Family. </p> <p>\"It all started when Fred Barron, the man behind The Larry Sanders Show and Seinfeld, came to stay over Christmas. I asked him why on earth someone who was a powerhouse of American sitcom should want to do one for the BBC in its decline. Very flatteringly, he said it was because of me: he'd seen me in Me and My Girl and thought I had a great gift for physical comedy. </p> <p>\"I explained why I didn't like British sitcoms - I thought they were caricatured and stereotyped, too quickly rehearsed and over- expansive because of the studio audience. But Fred countered that he wanted to create a real domestic comedy about middle-aged angst and that he'd use the actors' input. We then came up with the idea of Zoe Wanamaker as my partner and I was completely hooked.\" </p> <p>What makes My Family unusual is its attempt to apply American expertise to an English situation. The hero, Ben Harper, is a dentist with a tourist-guide wife and three troublesome children ranging in age from 12 to 19; so far, so familiar. But the scripts are the product of a large team headed by Barron himself, an American duo called Steven and James Armogida and an English pair, Ian Brown and James Hendrie. Each episode also takes on a topical issue - from drugs to school bullying - while using the actors' own experiences. </p> <p>\"In sitcom,\" Lindsay shrewdly observes, \"we work from character; Americans work from personality . What Fred does is tailor the script to your qualities. He's not that interested in character. The only given was that Ben should be a dentist because Fred's father was a Boston dentist who smoked during surgery and detested his patients. </p> <p>\"But Fred observes and listens. I told him about an incident this year over my 50th birthday. It went from being a big do at the Ivy to, finally, a small sit-down dinner for 10. I got into a real lather about it but my 13-year-old daughter said, 'For goodness' sake, it's only a party. You're not going to die. Stop over-dramatising.' That kind of attitude - the sane daughter correcting the harebrained father - finds its way into the script.\" </p> <p>The personality-driven show is a very American idea, stretching, adventurously, from Larry Sanders and Seinfeld back to the cosier era of Lucille Ball and Mary Tyler Moore. The one English example that comes readily to mind is Hancock's Half Hour. But My Family not only uses the actors' experience - the fact, for instance, that both Lindsay and Wanamaker are guiltily covert smokers - it applies to it the ruthless corporate expertise of American sitcom. The first episode went through 12 different drafts, involving frantic learning and un-learning of lines. \"Zoe,\" says Lindsay, \"is very methodical and likes to take her time. I'm the exact opposite: I can have a script and virtually know it by the end of the read-through. But I think the chemistry between us works very well.\" </p> <p>Lindsay brims with confidence about the series: he thinks it's the best pre-watershed comedy the BBC has found in years. But he's much more self-critical when it comes to looking at the arc of his own career. Twice he begins a sentence, \"If I have a problem...\" The first time, it's to say that he's made himself so diverse he can go almost anywhere.The second, it's to suggest he has a split artistic personality: part of him yearns to be taken seriously as a classical actor, another part leans towards comedy and song-and-dance. Actually, it's not a bad problem to have and is perfectly soluble. Thelma Holt has approached him to play Archie Rice in Osborne's The Entertainer, a part that requires both classical discipline and vaudevillian expertise. Lindsay is also developing a project about Morecambe and Wise with the help of the pair's families. It would tap into his instincts as \"a bit of a performer\". </p> <p>As for his post-Richard III outburst on radio, he expresses few regrets. \"I'd had a terrible first night. There was no rhythm to the show. The set had got stuck at one point. Then I picked up the papers, not least yours, to be told I lacked the necessary demonism. I just vented my spleen. I suppose what I really felt was that I was being used as a commodity, to help bring the coach parties in, rather than as a member of a company. I think I've been forgiven by the RSC, if not by the citizens of Stratford. But, whatever was wrong with the production, we ended up playing nine months in the West End, so in populist terms it worked.\" </p> <p>Lindsay bears no visible grudges. He also seems, at 50, justifiably happy with his lot. He lives comfortably in the pretty Buckinghamshire village of Denham, has a 13-year-old daughter by his first partner and a year-old son by his second and can afford to treat his whole family, including his father and sundry siblings, to a summer holiday. If anything still gnaws at him, you feel it is the desire to be taken seriously as a classical actor. If My Family turns into a big hit, it would be good if it bought him time to do a talent-stretching season with one of the national companies. Sitcom requires precise skills and pays the rent. But a great 19th-century critic, GH Lewes, once wrote: \"He is greatest who is greatest in the highest reaches of his art.\" It's a sentiment I recommend to Robert Lindsay and a whole army of British television actors. </p> <p>\u0095 My Family starts tonight at 8.30pm on BBC1.</p>",
  "<p>For those too young to remember, \"protest and survive\" was a slogan that peace campaigners adopted in the 1980s, after the Thatcher government published an absurd pamphlet entitled Protect and Survive advising what to do in a nuclear attack. It was the historian and activist EP Thompson who coined the pun, I seem to remember, for a book of political essays. Protest and Survive is also the title of a new show at London's Whitechapel Gallery about history and its use; the curators say they want to recover \"the political voice that is forever glossed over\" in art from the 1960s to today. </p> <p>Thompson was a romantic British socialist, a student of both Marx and William Morris, who argued in books such as The Making of the English Working Class that popular actions in the past, from bread riots to the poetry of William Blake, can be understood as expressions of a common culture of protest. Thompson was trying to find a common thread in the disparate strands of radicalism; in his day this meant finding a link between CND and the working class. In our day it means finding coherence in the diverse protest movements against the global economy. And in this exhibition it means trying to tie together threads of disparate fury in the art of the past 30 years. </p> <p>So what are they protesting against? What have you got? There's everything here: Gustav Metzger attacking the global economy with his proposal for a monument to the environment composed of rank upon rank of cars, and cartoonist Robert Thompson's flat-capped northerner telling his son as they contemplate smoking factories, \"One day son, all this will be art galleries.\" Then there's 1970s conceptual artist Cosi Fanni Tutti hiring herself out as a model and stripshow dancer in protest against... something, and the Conspiracy Paintings of David MacDermott and Peter MacGough, attacking abstract expressionism as a CIA front and fingering Aids as \"a manipulation of information for purposes of genocide and control, using street drugs and pharmaceuticals to murder and steal property\". </p> <p>This is a raggle-taggle collection of relics, featuring an ill-assorted army of 1970s hippies and skinheads. Whatever it was that made the Austrian artist Valie Export lie motionless in the street in 1972, I'm against it. I'll sign a petition against it. Just don't make me look at any more art relics. There's right-wing protest too, with Gilbert and George's picture of a bomber-jacketed Cocky Patriot (1980) standing between two union flags sewn on the buttocks of a pair of jeans. The homoeroticism complicates the far-right politics - but not enough for my liking. Gilbert and George have become so revered as godfathers of the new British art that young artists and curators now think they can see through their explicit hard right affinities to what they imagine is a core of queer radicalism. But G+G are flamboyantly, unrepentantly right-wing. At a recent public appearance at Tate Modern they confirmed that not only do they still love Margaret Thatcher, \"we even like William Hague\". </p> <p>What is missing from most of this art is analysis. Protest - what does that mean? It can be utterly incoherent and reactionary. \"No Derv for Paediatrician Pervs\", \"We Want Something or Other and We Want it Now!\" as the placards said in Steve Bell's cartoon on the fuel protest in last Thursday's Guardian. Karl Marx pointed out a long time ago that radical romanticism is a waste of time: if you want to change the world, you must first understand it. </p> <p>The best art here attempts to do that. Richard Hamilton's Treatment Room (1984) is an NHS operating theatre with creepy white and military green walls. There's a sink for the professionals to wash their hands after administering treatment. They work at a glass-windowed booth, flicking switches and watching the dials on an electronic control panel. The patient lies on a thin mattress and looks up at a screen with images of Margaret Thatcher speaking. </p> <p>This is a great political work of art because it is witty and does more than protest. Hamilton is an ironist with an acute feeling for history. He loves technology, and even in this study in terror there's a perverse enjoyment. As in his famous collage, Just What Is It That Makes Today's Homes So Different, So Appealing? (1956) - made as a poster for the exhibition This Is Tomorrow at this same gallery almost half a century ago - Hamilton uses an interior as an image of modern life. It is a room that exerts power over anyone who enters it. We are helpless before this historical juggernaut. In the end, we all submit to the treatment. </p> <p>However, while Treatment Room lingers in the mind, much of the art here doesn't. The style of the exhibition is deliberately anti-aesthetic. In a reaction against glitzy contemporary art shows, this one sets out to make you think. So you have to read a lot of words. The conceptual artist Steven Willats's contributions - early 1980s text and archive pieces in which witnesses describe post-punk subcultures - are mostly words. Only when you get to the end of his texts do you realise they weren't worth reading. Jo Spence's remodellings of photo history and medical history were also done largely in words. This is in the tradition of conceptual art, which was born in the late 1960s out of a suspicion of the image: artists who wanted to attack capitalism believed words were more honest than pictures. They thought they were continuing the Dadaist anti-art tradition, but the Dadaists discovered that images could be a form of political power: some of the most powerful images of the 20th century are German Dadaist John Heartfield's anti-Nazi photomontages. I wanted something like that here, something to bite into memory. </p> <p>Protest and Survive identifies politics in contemporary art with a suspicion of the aesthetic. This reflects the mood of young art in London. Artists and curators emerging in the wake of the Hirst generation are wary of making shiny, visually striking things to go in galleries. They see themselves as infinitely more serious. Politics is suddenly a word to conjure with. Artists want to be conceptual Marxists, like the 1970s group Art&amp;Language. </p> <p>But art is a symbolic practice. Artists create images, and images have political meanings - ones the artist might not predict. The most potent political works of the past few decades - like the great political art of the past from Goya to Guernica - deploy devastating images. This show could have included Andy Warhol's electric chairs, Ed Keinholz's Portable War Memorial, Chris Burden's Shoot, Joseph Beuys' Tramstop. </p> <p>Instead we get art whose sense of its own impotence cannot be concealed. Giorgio Sadotti's installation One...Two... (1993), consisting of a set of drums, guitars and amplifiers apparently just left by a band rehearsing in a garage, is melancholic. The catalogue links it to anarcho-skinhead writer Stewart Home's definition of revolution as \"one, two, three, four\" and it seems intended as an image of action. But it doesn't feel like that: it feels feeble, leftover, marginal. On the wall nearby is a painting by art collective Bank of a dismal factory landscape modelled on LS Lowry. \"Would you be worried if one of these northerners ceased to exist?\" asks a poster with the same Lowry stick figures. This is a pretty good joke. But it smacks of what political activists used to call defeatism. </p> <p>I think we are approaching the core of the exhibition's oddness. One of the curators is Matthew Higgs, founder at the age of 14 of a fanzine for Joy Division, a band not noted for their revolutionary optimism. The other is Paul Noble, inventor of Nobson Newtown, a scary imaginary town whose Nobslums and Nobjobclub he draws with meticulous despair. What a pair of miseries. This exhibition claims to revive the art of protest, but it is really an act of mourning. The problem with all the disjointed protests it brings together is that you never feel they are tangible or present. They happened; we pore over the relics. </p> <p>The curators should have read their EP Thompson. For Thompson there is no future without art. Culture is not the enemy; it is what we need to give us common purpose and strength. Symbols, narratives and argument are the resources Thompson believed were necessary if we were to protest and survive. This exhibition distrusts symbols, repudiates narrative. It contrasts unfavourably with the exhibition that beat all these new political art shows to it and did it better - Unconvention, curated by the artist Jeremy Deller last year at Cardiff's Centre for the Visual Arts (which, incidentally, has just been closed down by Cardiff's city council). </p> <p>Unconvention had an infectious enthusiasm to it, and a belief in art, culture and the human spirit, whether expressed in pop music, Jackson Pollock (both were in the show), or activism. It made you hopeful. Deller's contribution to Protest and Survive is funny and poignant, too: he shows a series of snapshots of Bozo the Clown, a middle-aged man in full clown makeup, wandering round the futuristic exhibits at Hanover's Expo 2000. The piece is called Has the World Changed, or Have I Changed? </p> <p>However, the real star of Protest and Survive is the Turner-shortlisted photographer Wolfgang Tillmans, who saves the show which he publicised as guest editor of the Big Issue. At the far end of the highest gallery at the Whitechapel he is given a long wall to create one of his free, collagistic installations of his own pictures mixed up with news headlines, magazine pictures and other stuff. Tillmans is anything but a conceptual artist. He's relaxed with making images, seeming to chance on them without thinking. And yet his montage of momentary glimpses of things, from rock festival crowds to an operating theatre to young soldiers, adds up to an image of living today, trying to protest and survive. It's poetic rather than rational, and all the better for it. At the centre of Tillmans's installation is a huge blown-up colour image of a sandcastle whose foundations are being lapped by the sea. A beautiful green wave flows towards the already tottering turrets. It makes you think of walls crashing down. </p> <p>\u0095 Protest and Survive is at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London E1 (020-7522 7878), till November 12.</p>",
  "<p>Space shuttle Atlantis rocketed away from the international space station early Monday, leaving the cosmic outpost fully stocked and freshly outfitted for its first inhabitants. </p> <p>The spacecraft separated some 240 miles above Russia, a few minutes late because of minor computer trouble. Afterward, pilot Scott Altman flew Atlantis around the station twice while his crewmates took pictures and videotape of the shining outpost. </p> <p>\"Watching the sunrise and sunset, and the way it illuminated the solar arrays on the service module was just phenomenal. It sparkled like a jewel out there against the blue background of the oceans. A very, very beautiful sight for us,\" Altman said. </p> <p>The craft flew together for eight days, during which Atlantis' seven-man crew completed all of their assigned tasks and even some planned for later missions. </p> <p>\"This crew has certainly laid out the red carpet for the first crew to come aboard the international space station,\" space station deputy manager Robert Cabana said. \"I think they accomplished everything we asked them to do, everything we wished they could do, and I think about everything we dreamed that they could do.\" </p> <p>During their five days inside, the shuttle astronauts outfitted the station with five new batteries, a toilet, oxygen generator and treadmill in the new Russian-built service module Zvezda. During a spacewalk a week ago, they hooked up power, data and TV cables. They also stocked the cabinets with more than 6,000 pounds of food, clothes, toiletries, ear plugs, office supplies, trash bags, vacuum cleaners and other gear. </p> <p>All of that will be waiting when the first station crew arrives for a four-month stay, scheduled to begin November 1. Shuttle Cmdr. Terrence Wilcutt said astronaut Bill Shepherd, who will lead a crew of two cosmonauts, won't have any trouble making his home inside Zvezda. </p> <p>\"It seemed like a new house, which is exactly what it was. It's ready to go. We tidied it up, left him a couple of notes and I think it's ready for him to move into,\" Wilcutt said. </p> <p>Atlantis' crew even warmed up the beds for Shepherd and company: Each of Atlantis' crew tried Zvezda's sleeping accommodations for a night, Wilcutt said. </p> <p>All that remains for Atlantis' crew is a bit of well-earned relaxation time and landing preparations. Tropical Storm Gordon is not expected in interfere with a scheduled Wednesday return to the Kennedy Space Centre. </p> <p>\"The forecast actually says that behind the storm, it should be pretty favourable weather conditions, so we're looking forward to those,\" mission operations representative Jeff Bantle said, but cautioned that it is too early to accurately predict. </p> <p>The storm was expected to stay well north of Cape Canaveral, where space shuttle Discovery is on its launch pad awaiting a planned October 5 departure for a space station construction mission. </p> <p>Nasa opted to keep Discovery on its pad because of the storm's path, and was not too concerned that the storm would knock launch preparations off schedule. </p> <p>\"We did lose a little time, but we built in contingency days,\" Bantle said.</p>",
  "The government will today promise to transform the byzantine system of school funding into a formula teachers and parents can understand - and will enable them to hold councils to account. <p>A green paper on local government finance in England will propose that when central government sets council budgets, it will specify the amount it expects each local education authority to spend on administration, and the amount that should be given directly to schools. Under targets set by the David Blunkett, the education secretary, authorities will be expected to hand over at least 90% of their education budget to schools. </p> <p>But the green paper proposals, to be unveiled by the local government minister Hilary Armstrong, are expected to be received as a \"curate's egg\" by head teachers. </p> <p>It falls short of satisfying calls from the National Association of Head Teachers and the Secondary Heads' Association for a national funding formula for schools. </p> <p>Under the proposals, councils will still be able to switch money between the different elements of the education budget, or out of the budget altogether. But the green paper will hold out the option of ringfencing the money in the future if councils do not obey government guidelines. </p> <p>The cash each council is expected to spend on education will be calculated on the basis of a simplified formula. </p> <p>There will be a flat rate, per-pupil spending, and two top-up elements: deprivation, and difficulty in recruiting and retaining teachers. </p> <p>Ministers believe the formula will enable communities to hold councils to account if they fail to hand over the money expected. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett has promised that any new formula will involve a \"levelling up, not down\". It will seek to address the persistent complaints of teachers in about 40 or so council areas which receive significantly less funding per pupil than other similar areas. </p> <p>But the system would ensure that blame continues to be shared with local councils if schools feel pressure from books shortages, for instance. </p> <p>Sources familiar with negotiations in Whitehall say Mr Blunkett pressed for a more radical separation of budgets, but was opposed by by John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, and by the Treasury. </p> <p>According to one account, Jack Straw, the home secretary, had a decisive input, persuading Mr Blunkett that it would be politically dangerous to take on more control of school funding by removing the local authority buffer.</p>",
  "<p>For too long further education has been the Cinderella of Oxford's admissions system. Last year only 459 candidates from further education colleges applied to Oxford. The figure for the maintained sector as a whole was 4,373, and for the independent sector 3,426. The further education success rate was also much lower than in the other sectors - 30% as against 40% in the entire maintained sector and almost 45% in the independent sector. </p> <p>Of course, special factors need to be taken into account. Some further education colleges have few A-level students and specialise in vocational and recreational courses. </p> <p>But that is not a reason for complacency. Students at further education colleges are self-motivated. Sometimes they choose further education because there are no sixth forms where they live. Sometimes they are disenchanted with school. But the crucial point is that they are at college because they made a positive choice to continue their education. They are treated as adults; and they are expected to organise their time and studies themselves. Many of them have exactly the qualities that Oxford looks for. </p> <p>There is no need to fear that a substantially higher further education intake would mean lower standards or need positive discrimination. It is doubly tragic that so few further education students apply to us - for the nation, because talented young people are failing to develop their potential to the full; for Oxford, because we are missing out on a group which has as much to offer us as we have to offer them. </p> <p>In two days' time, Mansfield College, Oxford will host a conference, sponsored by the Allied Irish Bank, to explore possible solutions. It is the first conference on this topic to be held at Oxford, but it is only one element in a much broader campaign. </p> <p>The social and cultural factors that lie behind Oxford's failure to tap the talent in further education colleges are deep-rooted and many-sided. </p> <p> Lack of confidence, lack of knowledge, negative stereotypes, the Brideshead image and perhaps a perverse, inverted snobbery all help to deter potential further education candidates from applying. </p> <p>But the crucial point is blindingly straightforward. For whatever reason, too few further education students realise that Oxford might be the university for them. Too few further education students realise this because Oxford hasn't done enough to tell them. </p> <p>Last year, Mansfield (fully supported by the university) decided that it was time to break down the barriers of habit and ignorance which have kept the application rate down. As a dissenting foundation, originally set up in the wake of Gladstone's legislation breaking the Anglican monopoly of the ancient universities, access is in our blood. </p> <p>But we soon realised that we couldn't make a significant difference to the problem on our own, so we set up a consortium of seven colleges (Harris, Manchester, Hertford, Keble, New College, St Hugh's and Worcester in addition to ourselves) with the common aim of targeting the sector to encourage more applications from it. </p> <p>Funding from Higher Education Funding Council for England made it possible to employ a highly effective, but part-time recruitment officer during the summer. The work she started will now be carried forward by a full-time successor - a recent Oxford graduate and former further education student - who has just been appointed with generous support from the Sutton Trust. </p> <p>The new recruitment officer will be part-missionary and part-saleswoman, not just for Mansfield but for the entire consortium, and indeed for the entire university. </p> <p>Thursday's conference will be an invaluable building block. We shall hold mock interviews in English and Engineering, explain the mysteries of the admissions process and give current Mansfield students the chance to describe the \"Oxford experience\". </p> <p>By the end of the day, we hope to have established an enduring dialogue between the further education sector and the university. </p> <p>A lot more will have to be done before Cinderella is fully ensconced at the ball. But I hope and believe that she is on her way. </p> <p> \u0095 Professor David Marquand is principal of Mansfield College.</p>",
  "<p>It is day one of your university induction course. Take the rifle and learn how to protect yourself against being killed by the local wildlife. In the field the student will need to put tripwires round the tent to set off thunderflashes in case of night attack, and learn how to pack a sledge and signal down a helicopter. </p> <p>Riding a bike from digs to lecture hall with a \u00a3500 university issue hunting rifle slung over your shoulder is routine for students enrolling at the most northerly campus on the planet. It is an outpost of Norway in the high Arctic properly known as Svalbard but better known to most Brits as Spitsbergen. Next to the hooks for coats is a gun rack. </p> <p>This centre of scientific excellence is closer to the pole than the edge of the Arctic Circle and takes protecting its students very seriously. It is only three years ago that a female student, walking unarmed less than a mile from the centre of the campus, was killed and half eaten by a polar bear. Her companion, another woman student, jumped over a cliff to avoid the same fate and survived, at the cost of two broken legs. </p> <p>Longyearbyen, the capital of Svalbard, has other claims to fame apart from being 78 degrees north, the haunt of polar bears and the only campus in Europe where the students are routinely armed by the university authorities. There are also local rules about security. No one locks their front door so everyone has a chance to escape into the nearest house if a polar bear is passing. </p> <p>It has probably the best ratio of professors to students on the planet and an extraordinary list of visiting lecturers in the specialist subjects of Arctic biology, geology, geophysics and technology. Spitsbergen, and the neighbouring islands that make up Svalbard, are dotted with international establishments at the frontiers of space technology, research into climate change and such projects as mapping precisely how fast continents are moving together or apart. </p> <p>Lasse Loennum, director of UNIS (University Courses on Svalbard) regrets one omission from his extraordinary line-up - British students. Although in 1999 there were 234 students from 22 countries and all of the lectures were in English, not a single UK student was enrolled. \"I like British students because their basic maths and physics is so good, but getting them here is very difficult.\" </p> <p>UNIS is jointly owned by the four Norwegian Universities and the first students were accepted in 1993 as an integrated part of the Norwegian system. There are no tuition fees and 35 courses are offered for undergraduates with about 50 M.Sc and Ph.D students. This year there are 14 professors on campus, 10 adjunct professors (visitors from other universities) and 170 guest lecturers. Most of the students come from Scandinavia, with half from Norway, but France, Italy and the US also send undergraduates. </p> <p>Although the campus is only 600 miles from the pole it is one of the warmest places in the Arctic because Svalbard's shores are washed by the most northerly extremity of the Gulf Stream. It is only 20 degrees below centrigrade in winter compared with 40 degrees in Canada much further south. In winter, when it is dark for three months, students are treated to almost daily displays of the northern lights because Svalbard is on the cleft of the magnetic field of the earth. </p> <p> This makes the nearby mountain an ideal study centre and the home of the two giant dishes which are the eyes and ears of European Incoherent Scatter Radar project which studies the effect of the sun on the earth's magnetic field. </p> <p> In summer the weather can be warm enough to sunbathe and temperatures can reach 20 degrees C during the four months without a sunset. </p> <p>Mr Loennum says that while Svalbard is a mecca for winter sports and wildlife enthusiasts, and students spend part of the year getting around on snowmobiles, the university is not an excuse for a \"tourist semester\". </p> <p>\"This is the smallest university in the world with the largest laboratory, this marvellous almost untouched stretch of the Arctic to study. We study things like permafrost, glaciers, global pollution and how it affects the Arctic and marine biology. The staff-student ratio is unrivalled so we expect people to take full advantage of the opportunity. We want people to be serious.\" </p> <p>UNIS has links with the University of Southampton, University of Wales in Cardiff and Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire but so far only at a post-graduate and teaching level. </p> <p>So far there are no undergraduates but Mr Leonnum hopes that word will filter back. \"We are hoping for a British contingent to complete our international flavour. After all, as all the lectures are in English, it seems a shame not to take advantage.\" </p> <p>The 35 courses on offer this year are up to one year's duration as part of biology, geology, geophysics or technology degrees. The university year lasts from August to June with the spring semester January to mid-June. </p> <p> See: <a href=\"http://www.unis.no\">www.unis.no</a></p>",
  "<p>Peter Snow was perturbed. Here he was, about to chair a public debate between journalists, scientists and social scientists. The topic was the vexed relationship between science and the media, and the focal point was a report I had written on scientific communication. But the editor due to defend the press - Rosie Boycott of the Express - had failed to turn up. </p> <p>The report's central charge is that after more than a decade of expensive \"public understanding of science\" programmes, scientists still don't know or care how the media work. And they don't show much sign of understanding how public opinion works either. If science is to make progress in this area, I argue, it needs to pay more attention to social science - a proposition as welcome as an animal rights protester in the lab. </p> <p>The view that science is in trouble with the public is establishment wisdom. BSE, the public revolt over GM foods and medical scandals have all undermined trust in scientists. According to a Mori poll for the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, which published an important report on science and society earlier this year, fewer than one in five of us are willing to take the word of a \"government scientist\". Independent scientists fare better, but not as well as they used to. </p> <p>The Lords report concluded that \"public unease, mistrust and occasional outright hostility are breeding a climate of deep anxiety among scientists\". It urged a series of remedies, including dropping the label \"public understanding of science\" - which, it argued, smacks of a lost age when scientists said most problems associated with scientific advances were the result of public ignorance. </p> <p>Today such a simple view of the problem is difficult to uphold. Social scientists who analyse the GM controversy or, say, the story of nuclear power, say the difficulties arose because scientists and politicians cut themselves off from opinion and insights outside their circle. Social science argues for a more interactive process of communication between scientists and the public, and for a more open process of negotiation. </p> <p>None of this has discouraged scientists from continuing to talk as if their difficulties with public opinion are primarily to be blamed upon an over-excitable and dumbed down mass media. So far as scientists are concerned, the media form a distorting lens designed to obscure the passage of truth and rational argument. </p> <p>Sir Robert May, the government's chief scientist, was arguing this line just the other day, reprimanding an interviewer on Radio 4's Today programme for taking such a strong interest in Ed Hooper's theory that HIV was transferred to humans as a result of scientific error. The Hopper hypothesis is presumably one of those \"quixotic minority\" views the Royal Society, no less, warns journalists against in the editorial guidelines it has asked the Press Complaints Commission to adopt as part of its editorial code. The Lords Committee recommended that the PCC agree to this dangerous text. </p> <p>The idea that science will prosper by evading controversy or depleting the diversity of viewpoints is surely deeply misguided, if not undemocratic. It arises from the enduring fallacy that scientists can or should be able to control the terms on which the public gets information about science. If this were ever possible, it is surely no longer so in a world of instant, ubiquitous and inter-active media. </p> <p>Equally, the \"distorting lens\" view of the media ignores work by social scientists on the complex meanings of media texts, and their social, historical, political and economic context. For example, a research report written for the House of Lords Committee analysing the GM affair would have us believe that newspapers can be plausibly divided into \"campaigning newspapers\", which tend to distort for effect, and \"reporting newspapers\", which give us things straight. </p> <p>What struck me about the coverage of GM was the way that some of the papers which campaigned most stridently - the Daily Mail for example - also provided large quantities of reasonably well-balanced information and opinion. Equally, it isn't hard to spot the loaded cultural assumptions engraved into every word of that most sober of \"reporting\" newspapers, the Financial Times, which published a leading article on GM food contrasting the relative attractions of \"intellectual barbarism and measured progress\". </p> <p>Likewise when scientists write about the media in specialised journals, they tend to operate upon the assumption that their own work is \"objective\" and unaffected by special interest or cultural context. So far as medical scientists are concerned, the Sun tells you lies, the Lancet tells you the truth. Journalists are slaves of cynical commercial systems, scientists independent truth-tellers. </p> <p>To judge by the debate that Rosie boycotted, however, the scientists may be regrouping for reflection on these matters. Dr Chris Exley, a chemist from Keele University, had been nominated by the British Academy to respond to the report. He said that most of the problems in science communication should be laid at the door of scientists. Scientists needed to communicate more clearly and engage with alternative perspectives. </p> <p>Professor Steven Rose, director of the Brain and Behaviour Research Group at the Open University, went further. He argued that commercialisation was leading to \"science conducted by megaphone\", with the risk that those scientists most skilled at shouting most loudly would acquire the most influence, regardless of the quality of their work or the independence of their position. The sharpest charge made in the debate was that too many scientists are willing to mislead the public about their work, in pursuit of acclaim or money. </p> <p>Professor Brian Wynne, a scientist turned social scientist from Lancaster University, argued that most science bestsellers were about \"science without consequences\". He said it was the type of science that confronts people in their daily lives which generates real controversy and demands a more consultative approach to decisions based on scientific discoveries. </p> <p>Lord Jenkin, who chaired the House of Lords inquiry, reported strong resistance in scientific circles to his committee's recommendation that the term \"public understanding of science\" be abandoned in favour of the more open \"science and society\". </p> <p>The next test will come in the government's delayed response to the Jenkin report; not least because ministers are often as keen as scientists on the \"media hysteria\" account of science's difficulties with the public. </p> <p>The government should realise that if it does dismiss the Jenkin report, it will align itself with a diminishing and out-of-touch scientific elite. Many younger scientists hold the basic democratic assumption that science should be challenged by citizens on non-scientific grounds, and see the media as a vital, if sometimes boorish, part of that process. </p> <p><strong>'Everyone is going to try to talk up their area'</strong><br></p> <p>Interviews by Lee Elliot Major<br></p> <p> It is a pity Ian Hargreaves does not offer any substantive evidence counter to the points I made in a BBC online debate -that decision makers at the BBC are temperamentally, because of their background, anti-science. </p> <p>One of the mistakes the media make is assuming that to make science interesting, even newsworthy, it has to be packaged in a particular way, emphasising presentation over substance. The kind of science story that attracts attention is often associated with a virtual cult of personality of celebrities. </p> <p>Alleging that scientists misinform the press imputes a Machiavellianism to scientists that is hard to support. I find it hard to believe that there are Max Cliffords in the scientific world plotting to get prions onto the front page of the Sun.</p> <p><strong>Michael Rennie</strong></p> <p> Symers Professor of Physiology, University of Dundee </p> <p> More than half of people polled quite reasonably say that the pace the modern science is such that you cannot trust the government's regulatory machine to keep up with it. </p> <p>It is factually untrue to say that scientists get a bad press. </p> <p>Science is a discipline practised by human beings, not very different from any other human beings, and it is not surprising that among them there are many people who are extremely ambitious, and are not beyond using manipulation of the media for the purpose of heightening the sense of excitement about what they have done. I wouldn't say anyone does so with deliberate dishonesty, but some people let their enthusiams run away with them. </p> <p><strong>Sir Bob May</strong></p> <p> the government's Chief Scientific Adviser </p> <p> Scientists are at least 95% to blame for the bad press they attract.

  "<p>Christopher Fletcher was amazed when he came down to breakfast one morning to find his 14-year-old son Mark in floods of tears, begging not to be sent to school that day. His amazement turned to shock and rage when he found out that some of his son's classmates had set up a web page devoted to Mark. Posted on the site was a variety of abuse and taunts. It had already been seen not only by the pupils in Mark's class, some of whom had accessed it via the computers at their school, but by other children in the area, one of whom had phoned to alert Mark. </p> <p>Christopher already knew that there had been problems in Mark's class and that boys had been picking on each other throughout the year; but he had thought that the situation had been resolved. He was horrified to find that the extremely public humiliation via techno-bullying was the culmination of a sustained campaign directed against his son. </p> <p>\"The internet may be a wonderful thing, but this was just evil; it wasn't a game, it wasn't schoolboy banter, it was a very nasty, public, personal attack,\" he says. \"The page said he was fat, gay, had no friends - and plenty more like that. The site had been accessed via the school computers during the lunch-hours, it had been seen by most of his class, by his peer group, and he was extremely upset.\" </p> <p>The site has been taken down now, as far as Christopher knows; but the damage has been done. \"It's very worrying, because there's no control at all over what goes up on the web.\" </p> <p>It is the first case of this particular kind of techno-bullying that Hereward Harrison, director of policy at Childline, has come across; but, sadly, he's not surprised. \"Young people are very inventive,\" he says. \"We have heard of instances of using text messages on mobile phones to bully other children. The technology for this kind of behaviour is there now, and bullies are turning it to their own ends.\" </p> <p>Similarly, Susan Littlemore, communications director at Parentline Plus, a charity that runs a free help and information service on all aspects of parenting, is concerned but hardly amazed at the emergence of techno-bullying. \"Kids are very ingenious in the ways that they bully each other. Technology is moving on and children today are extremely computer-literate; I should think that any technological framework that's set up to stop children saying horrible things online will quickly be circumvented.\" </p> <p>So what can be done to help children who find themselves in a similar situation to Mark Fletcher? Hereward Harrison says that dealing with techno-bullying starts with gathering evidence and getting adult help. The first step he recommends is to keep a detailed diary of what's happening, including any abusive emails or downloaded web pages, and show it to a parent or teacher. \"Making the situation public is very positive when it comes to bullying. Then you need to set up a meeting between parents, school and the young person themselves, and formulate a plan of action; if necessary go to school governors, or the local education authority. In some cases the intervention of the police has been very effective.\" </p> <p>But when Christopher Fletcher approached his son's school, he found that getting help was not easy. \"They first said that because the site hadn't been concocted on school equipment, it was nothing to do with them. When I pointed out that it had been accessed from school computers, they were more interested. I had a letter from the head saying he had spoken to the boys concerned, but the overall tone was one of 'boys will be boys'. \" </p> <p>Fletcher was sufficiently incensed by this cavalier approach to seek legal advice. \"What the school took some time to appreciate was that Mark has been libelled. It's like putting up a sign on a roundabout that everyone can read. We're entitled to sue for libel on his behalf. I am going to tell the school that if it happens again, we will be suing - taking out injunctions against the parents of the boys concerned, impounding their home computers, and, if school computers were used, impounding those too.\" </p> <p>Christopher Fletcher may not be so far off the mark in thinking about the legal implications of techno-bullying. In April of this year, a professor at the City College in San Francisco launched a libel lawsuit over allegations made by students on a website that he is \" racist and mentally ill\". Daniel Curzon Brown describes the site as \"evil\" and claims that the attacks had made him \"depressed and afraid\". He is currently suing the company that runs the website. </p> <p>According to Susan Littlemore, schools don't always do all they can to help bullied children in more conventional situations, let alone ones aggravated by the use of technology. She says that many parents are let down by teachers, even when their child has been bullied to the end of his or her tether. \"Parents are often surprised by how long their child has managed to conceal the issue, and when the parents find out, it's often an extreme situation by then. Not only is the child disturbed, but the parents are extremely distressed.\" </p> <p> When it comes to techno-bullying, says Littlemore, \"the argument isn't about creating a sterile environment where abuses can't happen, because that's probably impossible\". The way forward, she says, is for schools to set up an anti-bullying policy. \"We are finding this isn't happening. Parents with legitimate concerns who approach their child's school aren't being heard. Getting parents involved is essential. It's easy for those who are delivering education to focus solely on education, which is why parents need to become involved and voice their concerns.\" </p> <p>Teachers, however, would argue that they are beleaguered enough already without adding to their workload. \"It's impossible for teachers to police what's happening outside school - it's difficult enough inside,\" says a spokeswoman for the National Union of Teachers. \"If the teachers are aware of bullying, they can do something about it, but bullied children are often very secretive. Teachers can't see what children are doing on their computers at home; they can't monitor pupils' private lives. That is where parents come in.\" </p> <p>She recommends keeping home computers in shared spaces. \"If the computer is in the living room then you can see on a regular basis as you pass by what your child is doing.\" The computer shouldn't be hidden away in the child's bedroom, she says. \"If the parents of the children involved in this particular case had known what their children were doing, they might have been able to put a stop to it. Parents must monitor home use.\" </p> <p>Littlemore isn't so sure. \"Whenever a community is set up, that community has responsibilities. Schools need to take that on board. When schools say they don't know what to do about bullying or it's not up to them to deal with it, the parents are stuck in the middle - it's very unpleasant.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Next month Parentline Plus is launching an anti-bullying initiative for parents; for more information call their free helpline on 0808 800 2222 (textline 0800 783 6783) or visit <a href=\"http://www.parentlineplus.org.uk\">www.parentlineplus.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Leonard Slatkin, 57, takes over as chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the beginning of next month, and next year will become the first overseas conductor to perform at the Last Night of the Proms.</strong> </p> <p>Even as a very young child I had little doubt that I would make a career as a professional musician. My father, Felix, was leader of the 20th Century Fox orchestra, my mother, Eleanor Aller, was principal cellist for the Warner Brothers Studio Band, and they both played in the celebrated Hollywood String Quartet. They played everything from classical to film scores to popular music and we had a huge range of musicians and performers visiting the house, from Schoenberg and Stravinsky to Danny Kaye, Nat King Cole and Doris Day. </p> <p>\"Although I received a lot of encouragement from my parents, I was also taught that music was an extremely serious business. The family atmosphere was very competitive and although I started playing the violin when I was two and a half years old, I gave up when I realised I wasn't going to be as good as my father. </p> <p>\"We lived in Los Angeles and my schooldays were spent at junior school in Wilshier Crest and LA High School. Music was an important part of school life at LA High in the 1950s, and there were three choruses, two bands, an orchestra and a composer in residence. </p> <p>\"I became interested in composition and went to study at Indiana University when I was 18. My father died a little while later, and I went through a period of intense insecurity. I quit music and went to City College; it was the early 60s and there was a lot of social change in the air and I toyed with the idea of becoming a teacher. However, there were always musicians lurking in the background trying to lure me back into the profession and I eventually became taken with the idea of conducting. I went off to Aspen to study under Walter Susskind and then on to the Juillard in Paris to study with Jean Morel. </p> <p>My real inspiration was the music itself. You become so riveted and driven by what the music is saying to you that you have to respond.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Florida Straits run through the middle of the Cuban psyche like a geological fault. On either side of the shark-infested divide lie totally different identities - one individual and competitive, the other collective and easygoing. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the treachorous waters between Havana and Miami have provided the setting for the climactic dramas of recent Cuban history: the mass boatlift of 1980, the shooting down of exile pilots by the Cuban Air Force in 1996, and, of course, the discovery at sea last November of a five-year-old shipwreck survivor called Elian Gonzalez. </p> <p>The same patch of ocean is also the setting for the pivotal scene in Outcast, a new novel by the Cuban writer, Jos\u00e9 Latour, which uses crime fiction to portray the two poles of the Cuban experience as a stark and somewhat depressing choice: a repressive economic failure on one side of the Straits, and a sleazy underworld on the other. Halfway between the two, Outcast's anti-hero, a Havana schoolteacher named Elliot Steil, finds himself cast into the waters and forced to survive in the eddying currents. </p> <p>Outcast was first discovered by a small New York art-house publisher called Akashic Books, but now it is about to hit the big time. Rights have been bought by a string of European publishing giants, and by Harper Collins in the US and the UK, where it is due to be published next year. Hollywood is interested in the film rights. The book will soon be too internationally visible for the Cuban government to ignore, and what happens to Latour now will be a measure of how far the regime has gone towards relaxing its cultural vigilance. </p> <p>In the circumstances, it is an extremely brave book. It contains the most unflinching depiction of life under Fidel Castro to have emerged from Cuba for years - an insider's account of survival through the poverty-stricken \"Special Period\" of the early 90s. But it casts an equally cold eye on the corruption-riddled world of the Cuban-American exiles in Miami. </p> <p>In his family's modest Havana apartment where he lives with his wife and two children, the 60-year- old author, a former civil servant at the Cuban ministry of sugar, waits to see what will happen next. He seems more amused than anxious. </p> <p>\"If I spent my time worrying about what they [the government] thought, I would never write another word,\" Latour says. However, he thinks the days are past in Cuba when a writer like himself would routinely be thrown in prison. </p> <p>\"If I had written this book in the 70s, I would have been sent to jail. The problems were the same, but the intolerance was much more severe,\" he argues. The government, however, is still inclined to lock up the occasional dissident, and Latour's writing does appear to test the limits of its supposed new-found tolerance. </p> <p>His last crime novel, The Fool, was the tale of a couple of corrupt Cuban intelligence agents who arrange to launder Colombian drug money through sugar deals on the the New York Stock Exchange. His Cuban state-run publishers would not touch it, but Latour is entirely unrepentant: \"They are the ones who close their eyes to reality. In the 1980s all Cubans learned that in real life several persons in top positions were convicted for different crimes, like embezzlement of government funds and drug smuggling,\" he says. \"So why should Cuban crime literature avoid dealing with our problems? I refuse to practise self-censorship. I have the right to write what I want.\" </p> <p>For several months this year, the big billboard's near Latour's house were filled with the angelic face of little Elian, the Cuban martyr. Latour - like practically everyone on the island, whatever their political beliefs - was outraged by the machinations of the Miami exiles in their attempts to keep the boy away from his father. It was a rare rallying point in cynical times, and the party made the most of it. But now Elian is home, and the regime is struggling to keep the momentum of popular fervour going. Elian's face has now been replaced by a slogan in red on white: \"ABAJO LA LEY DE AJUSTE CUBANO\" (DOWN WITH THE CUBAN ADJUSTMENT ACT). It refers to the US legislation that offers Cubans the prospect of citizenship if they can make it to dry land. If they are caught in the open sea, they can be returned to Cuba. Havana blames the act for luring so many ambitious or desperate Cubans into the Florida Straits on no more than rafts and car inner tubes. But as rallying calls go, it somehow lacks Elian's human intensity. </p> <p>Latour can only sigh in exhaustion at the party's new mobilising strategy. \"The problem with Cuba now is that there are a thousand who believe we should keep up this crazy fervour struggling against American laws, but there are 10 million who don't,\" he says. \"But this tiny minority will prevail because their thinking is in line with the government. Most people are sick and tired with ideological issues.\" </p> <p>Elliot Steil, the hapless social outcast of Latour's new book, has hitherto been too attached to the good things about Cuba (\"the kindness inherent in most people was baffling; race relations were harmonious, the lifestyle easygoing and romantic, the women beautiful, the climate great\") to seriously consider trying to emigrate or floating to Florida on a raft. But then a mysterious American turns up, offering to facilitate Steil's flight to the US, in honour of a promise he once made to the schoolteacher's late father. </p> <p>But the apparent saviour turns into his nemesis on the open sea. The secret of the stranger's identity and his reasons for wishing Steil dead can only be found in Miami, where he washes up, a bedraggled survivor. </p> <p>Back in Havana, Outcast's success has brought Latour all manner of excitement, but some absurd new complications at the same time. He pulls out a movie contract. The studio is keen but there is a problem with sanctions. They can't pay a Cuban, even if that Cuban is an independent-minded man like Latour. The lawyers are looking at the situation. Latour can only laugh. There is probably trouble brewing for him in Havana, but he cannot bring himself to make the crossing so many others dream about, and become an American.</p>",
