  "<p>It's a funny old time, early pregnancy. You're not supposed to tell everyone why you are dragging yourself through the workday in a state of bone-vapourised exhaustion, why you are gagging at a colleague's innocuous air freshener, why you are irritably consuming mineral water at work social functions (I am ashamed to say I eventually snapped \"I'm in rehab\" to one innocent inquirer - sorry). </p> <p>Exactly how and when to break the news to your boss and colleagues can be perplexing, particularly as the weeks wax and your waistline also waxes (although always having a cake on your desk can be a plausible if pathetic alibi). </p> <p>Do you make an announcement after 12 weeks when the risk of miscarriage drops, or after the first scan, once strange movements are visible on the surface of your burgeoning \"beer belly\"? And what exactly do you say to your blokier male colleagues: \"By the way lads, I'm up the duff. Mine's not a lager\"? </p> <p>For some women, especially those in predominantly male workplaces, there can be a terrible sense of exposure. The private life you've always kept private is suddenly pushing out the front of your suits. There is no male equivalent. </p> <p>Julia, a 33-year-old former City high-flier, says: \"It was weird. I spent 10 years in the City pretending not to be a girl and then you're pregnant and you can't pretend any more. You're at a meeting talking about something to do with business, and someone's kicking you from the inside. And how do you feel businesslike in a tent dress and button-front tights?\" </p> <p>Julia's situation was made more difficult by the fact that she suffered from complications early in her pregnancy. \"I had to go to the hospital for an emergency scan, so I ended up telling my boss and the team at around eight weeks. They were all terribly chivalrous at first. I got sent expensive flowers. They were all lovely about it - or so I thought.\" </p> <p>Then Julia overheard the other members of her team on the phone, cutting her out of a deal. \"The awful thing was the next day one of them was talking to me, saying how great it was about the babies and offering me all this old baby gear.\" </p> <p>For other women, there are feelings of guilt - particularly for those who occupy an important position in a small company, or who know that her workmates are going to have to cover for her in her absence. Because the reality is that, whatever the law says, maternity can still be perceived as a major inconvenience - to the company and to other colleagues. And women are still brought up to care about inconveniencing other people. </p> <p>Anna, a marketing director for a design company, felt obliged to tell her (female) MD when she was only seven weeks pregnant because she'd just been given funds for a new project. Before she got the words out, her MD guessed. \"My MD said: 'Don't tell me, you're fucking pregnant.' I replied: 'This isn't quite how I was planning to tell you.' She turned to the chairman and said: 'Don't worry about me. I've been sterilised.' I burst into tears.\" </p> <p>Anna ultimately found herself \"restructured\" into a lesser role. She took voluntary redundancy and a modest payment, rather than fight it out in an employment tribunal a few months after the birth of her first baby. </p> <p>Although most employers these days probably realise that it is unlawful to penalise a woman for having a baby, some are probably cynical enough to rely on the reluctance of many women to embark on litigation at a time which is supposed to be joyful (not to mention exhausting). </p> <p>And ironically, the problems frequently arise with other women - the boss who feels her own plans for a baby are affected, the colleague who has fertility problems or has decided not to have children for career reasons and feels that women who do have children are somehow letting the side down. And in a society where those with jobs increasingly seem to feel overworked, overstressed and sleep-deprived, there may also be a feeling that the woman who is taking maternity leave or coming back on flexitime is getting an unfair break or increasing the burden on others. Some of this sentiment seems to be reflected in a recent Management Today survey in which numerous managers expressed their disgruntlement with \"family-friendly\" policies. </p> <p>Imperfect as things are, we are none the less a world away from the experiences of our mothers' generation. Tessa was a social worker in the 60s before the sex discrimination legislation was brought in. You didn't have to be pregnant to be written off at work, just being married would do. </p> <p>\"The first day I arrived at the office and sat in the duty room. The senior childcare officer introduced me as 'Mrs'. There were a lot of unmarried women of a certain age. A lot was made of the fact that I got on well with the babies and children. Eventually, a senior childcare officer took me aside and asked if I thought I would be better off at home having some children of my own since I was clearly so fond of them. I was always treated as temporary - it was assumed that I would not stay. Young unmarried women who joined later were put on a promotion track and were treated differently.\" </p> <p>Hopefully, many women these days find their experiences are similar to those of Nicola, who works in food technology for a major supermarket chain and whose employers seem to have done everything by the book. Her pregnancy has made no difference to her internal job move and her boss has encouraged her to work at her own pace, and cut down on travelling when she began to have problems with her blood pressure. </p> <p>Nicola finds that the pressure she feels comes from herself. She feels a sense of responsibility to her team, anxiety about how they will cope in her absence and unhappy that her health problems have meant that she cannot carry on exactly as normal: \"You feel disappointed in yourself.\" </p> <p>This is the paradox. Of course you are entitled to be treated the same as everyone else when you are pregnant, but you are not the same, and for many women the hardest part of all is moderating the demands they make on themselves. </p> <p>As for me, by the time I got round to telling my own colleagues, most of the women had noticed anyway. I like to think it was only because of the nose-dive my work wardrobe had taken - the sudden rash of gussets and smocking - but I'm probably fooling myself. No doubt it was really the bad temper, the avocado complexion and the snoozing at the desk which gave the game away. But I needn't have felt any trepidation about coming clean, because everyone was charming - I was inundated by offers of advice, frocks, changing mats. Enough to moisten the eyes of an already fat and hormonal person. </p> <p>And it was just as well I got it over with when I did, because the following week my belly did a weird trick, where it suddenly poked out dramatically like one of those poptop camper vans. Male colleagues shook their heads at it in bemusement: \"I just can't believe I didn't notice that...\"</p>",
  "<p>For Alexis and her friend Jimmy, both growing up in Harlem, there has been no time for childhood. It is all slaps, pinches, punches, hustles and gimmicks. A gimmick can mean many things: a shooting-up kit, a prostitute turning a trick or someone who is a fake. Alexis and Jimmy, respectively in love with words and painting, want to get away from gimmicks, the adults who have betrayed them by sinking into drink, dope and depression, and the streets that offer them no future. They dream of blue oceans and Paris, but only one of them makes it. </p> <p>Dael Orlandersmith's one-woman show, clearly strongly autobiographical, contains no gimmicks. It is affectingly simple and true, shot through with the resigned acceptance, abrasive humour and gritty sense of purpose that took the fat, unloved little girl off the streets and into the library, where she discovered James Baldwin and the fact that she was not alone. </p> <p>This is very straightforward storytelling and is not particularly theatrical. But both Orlandersmith's writing and stage presence are striking. At the end we are applauding not just the show but the woman herself, and in this instance, it seems absolutely right and proper that should be the case. </p> <p> \u0095 Till August 13.

  "The Government published detailed national guidance on school trips two years ago after a series of incidents including the 1993 Lyme Bay canoeing tragedy in which four sixth formers lost their lives. <p>It gives advice on planning and organising activities both in and out of school, at home and overseas. A spokesman for the Department for Education and Employment said it was based on \"good practice\". Guidelines include recommendations on the number of teachers who should accompany pupils (ideally 1:10) as well as information about the law governing transport and other health and safety issues. </p> <p>Schools which use the services of specialist travel companies - such as PGL which was involved in yesterday's tragedy - are advised to check out their safety track record and insurance arrangements. </p> <p>In the Lyme Bay incident in 1993, four sixth formers from Southway school, Plymouth, died during what was described at the trial of the directors of the outdoor activity centre as an ill conceived and poorly executed canoe trip. What was meant to be a two hour paddle to Charmouth, Dorset, ended in disaster after the weather worsened and the canoes became swamped, forcing the children into the water for hours. Four children were rescued with their teacher and two instructors. </p> <p>The dangers of excursions involving large numbers of children resurfaced last month when a boy went missing from a cross-Channel ferry. The 13-year-old from Birmingham was found safe and well in France after a four-and-a-half hour search involving British and French police and coastguards. </p> <p>He had become separated in Lyon from a school party of around 40 pupils and teachers as they returned to Britain from a week-long trip to Barcelona, Spain. </p> <p>Last month, an inquest heard of the death of 15-year old Rachel Williams, who died after hitting a tree on a school skiing trip to America. Rachel had just five ski lessons before she died on New Year's Day during the trip with Hayle community school in Cornwall. </p> <p>School trips are considered an essential extra dimension to work in the classroom, but teachers complain increasingly that they involve so much paperwork - often not related to safety at all - that they are often not worth the trouble.</p>",
  "<p>A German academic fears a violent backlash from orthodox Muslims because of his \"blasphemous\" theory that the Koran has been changed and revised. Such a backlash is not to be taken lightly; the Salman Rushdie affair is a solemn reminder of the power of an angry Muslim community. After the author wrote his novel Satanic Verses, which was considered by Muslims to be blasphemous, a fatwa , or religious decree, was pronounced against him in 1989 that left him fearing for his life. Rushdie has only recently reappeared in public after nearly 10 years in hiding. </p> <p>According to Muslim belief, the Koran is the eternal, unaltered Word of God, which has remained the same for 14 centuries. </p> <p>But Dr Gerd R Puin, a renowned Islamicist at Saarland University, Germany, says it is not one single work that has survived unchanged through the centuries. It may include stories that were written before the prophet Mohammed began his ministry and which have subsequently been rewritten. </p> <p>Puin's conclusions have sparked angry reactions from orthodox Muslims. \"They've said I'm not really the scholar to make any remarks on these manuscripts,\" he said. </p> <p>The semitic philologist, who specialises in Arabic calligraphy and Koranic palaeography, has been studying Sa'na manuscripts, ancient versions of the Koran discovered in Sa'na, the capital of Yemen. </p> <p>So controversial are his findings that the Yemeni authorities have denied him further access to the manuscripts. </p> <p>He says they shed new light on the early development of the Koran as a book with a \"textual history\", which contradicts the fundamental Muslim belief that it is the unchanging Word of God. </p> <p>Any questioning of the authenticity of the Koranic text as the Word of God can expect a hostile reaction. The fatwa , or death sentence, was issued against Rushdie for hinting in Satanic Verses that the Koran may include verses from other sources - chiefly Satan. </p> <p>Academics offering radical interpretations of the Koran put their lives at risk. In 1990, Dr Nasr Abu Zaid, formerly a lecturer in Koranic Studies at Cairo University, provoked a national outcry in Egypt over his book The Concept of the Text. There were death threats from Muslim extremists, general public harassment, and in 1995 he was branded an apostate by Egypt's highest court. The court forced him to divorce his wife because under Islamic law, marriage between an apostate and a Muslim is forbidden. </p> <p>Zaid's proposal was arguably less radical than Puin's. Zaid's book argued that \"the Koran is a literary text, and the only way to understand, explain, and analyse it is through a literary approach\". A Muslim, Zaid remained in Egypt for a time to refute the apostasy charges, but fled with his wife to Holland in the face of increasing death threats. </p> <p>Puin believes that he will not receive the same reaction, because unlike Zaid or Rushdie he does not have a Muslim name. </p> <p>His claim that the Koran has changed since its supposed standardisation, and that pre-Islamic texts have crept in, would nonetheless be regarded as highly blasphemous by Muslims. He has not yet written a book on his radical findings, but says it is \"a goal to achieve\" in the near future. </p> <p>Dr Tarif Khalidi, lecturer in Islamic Studies at Cambridge University, warns that the book may generate a controversy similar to Satanic Verses. \"If Dr Puin's views are taken up and trumpeted in the media, and if you don't have many Muslims being rational about it, then all hell may break loose.\" </p> <p>Khalidi fears Muslims will not accept Puin's work on the Sa'na manuscripts as having been done with academic objectivity, but see it as a deliberate \"attack on the integrity of the Koranic text\". </p> <p>The manuscripts, thought to be the oldest surviving copies of the Koran, were discovered in the ancient Great Mosque of Sa'na in 1972, when the building was being restored after heavy rainfall, hidden in the loft in a bundle of old parchment and paper documents. They were nearly thrown away by the builders, but were spotted by Qadhi Isma'il al-Akwa, then president of the Yemeni Antiquities Authority, who saw their importance and sought international assistance to preserve and examine them. </p> <p>Al-Akwa managed to interest Puin, who was visiting Yemen for research purposes in 1979. Puin in turn persuaded the German government to organise and fund a restoration project. The restoration revealed that some of the parchment pages dated from the seventh and eighth centuries, the crucial first two centuries of Islam, from which very few manuscripts have survived. </p> <p>Until now, there were three ancient copies of the Koran. One copy in the Library of Tashkent in Uzbekistan, and another in the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul, Turkey, date from the eighth century. A copy preserved in the British Library in London, known as the Ma'il manuscript, dates from the late seventh century. But the Sa'na manuscripts are even older. Moreover, the Sa'na manuscripts are written in a script that originates from the Hijaz - the region of Arabia where the prophet Mohammed lived, which makes them not only the oldest to have survived, but one of the earliest copies of the Koran ever. </p> <p>Puin noticed minor textual variations, unconventional ordering of the chapters (surahs), as well as rare styles of orthography. Then he noticed that the sheets were palimpsests - manuscripts with versions written even earlier that had been washed off or erased. </p> <p>These findings led Dr Puin to assert that the Koran had undergone a textual evolution. In other words, the copy of the Koran that we have is not the one believed to have been revealed to the prophet. </p> <p>This is something that Muslims would find offensive.The idea that the Koran is the literal Word of God, unchanging and permanent, is crucial to Islam.The traditional Muslim view holds that the Koran was revealed to Mohammed by God in fragments between 610 and 632 AD. The revealed verses were \"recorded on palm leaves and flat stones and in the hearts of men [meaning memorised],\" and remained in this state during the prophet's lifetime. </p> <p>About 29 years after Mohammed's death during the rule of the third Muslim caliph, Uthman, a standard copy of the Koran in a book form, was made, because already divergent readings and copies were circulating in the growing Islamic empire. This Uthmanic recension, according to the Muslim view, was produced with meticulous care, based on earlier copies of the Koran made according to the instructions of the prophet. </p> <p>Orthodox Muslims insist that no changes have occurred to the Koran since the Uthmanic recension. But this view is challenged by the Sa'na manuscripts, which date from shortly after the Uthmanic recension. </p> <p>\"There are dialectal and phonetical variations that don't make any sense in the text\", says Puin. \"The Arabic script is very defective - even more so in the early stages of its literature.\" </p> <p>Like other early Arabic literature, the Sa'na Koran was written without any diacritical marks, vowel symbols or any guide to how it should be read, says Puin. \"The text was written so defectively that it can be read in a perfect way only if you have a strong oral tradition.\" The Sa'na text, just like other early Korans, was a guide to those who knew it already by memory, he says. Those that were unfamiliar with the Koran would read it differently because there were no diacritical and vowel symbols. </p> <p>As years went by, the correct reading of the Koran became less clear, he says. People made changes to make sense of the text. Puin gives as example Hajjaj bin Yusuf, governor of Iraq from 694-714 AD, who \"was proud of inserting more than 1,000 alifs [first letter of the Arabic alphabet] in the Koranic text\". </p> <p>Professor Allen Jones, lecturer in Koranic Studies at Oxford University, agrees. </p> <p>\"Hajjaj is also responsible for putting the diacritical marks in the Koran. His changes are a defining moment in the history of the Koran\". </p> <p>After Hajjaj's changes in around the 700s, \"the Koranic text became pretty stable\", he says. </p> <p>Puin accepts this up to a point, but says that certain words and pronunciations were standardised in the ninth century. He says the Uthmanic text was the skeleton upon which \"many layers of interpretation were added\" - causing the text to change. </p> <p>This is blasphemy, according to orthodox Muslims, and is not entirely accepted by other academics. </p> <p>Jones admits there have been \"trifling\" changes made to the Uthmanic recension. Khalidi says the traditional Muslim account of the Koran's development is still more or less true. \"I haven't yet seen anything to radically alter my view,\" he says. </p> <p>He believes that the Sa'na Koran could just be a bad copy that was being used by people to whom the Uthmanic text had not reached yet. \"It's not inconceivable that after the promulgation of the Uthmanic text, it took a long time to filter down.\" </p> <p>Puin's other radical theory is that pre-Islamic sources have entered the Koran. He argues that two tribes it mentions, As-Sahab-ar-Rass (Companions of the Well) and the As- Sahab-al-Aiqa (Companions of the Thorny Bushes) are not part of the Arab tradition, and the people of Mohammed's time certainly did not know about them. </p> <p>\"These are very unspecific names, whereas other tribes are specifically mentioned,\" said Dr Puin. </p> <p>His researches have shown that the ar-Rass lived in pre-Islamic Lebanon and the al-Aiqa in the Aswan region of Egypt around 150AD, according to the Atlas of Ptolemy. He argues that pre-Islamic sources entered the Koran, presumably when the growing Islamic empire came into contact with those regions and sources. </p> <p>Khalidi says finding pre-Islamic registers in the Koran does not discredit the Muslim belief in any way, because it does not threaten the integrity of the Koran. \"The Koran was revealed at a particular time in the vocabulary of the age\", he says. </p> <p>Puin also questions another sacred belief that Muslims hold about the Koran, that it was written in the purest Arabic. He has found many words of foreign origin in the text, including the word \"Koran\" itself. Muslim scholars explain the \"Koran\" to mean recitation, but Puin argues that it is actually derived from an Aramaic word, qariyun, meaning a lectionary of scripture portions appointed to be read at divine service. He says the Koran contains most of the biblical stories but in a shorter form and is \"a summary of the Bible to be read in service\". </p> <p>Orthodox Muslims have always held that the Koran is a scripture in its own right, and never a shortened version of the Bible, even if both texts contain the same prophetic tradition. </p> <p>Khalidi says he is weary of constant attempts by western Islamicists to analyse the Koran in a parallel way to the Bible. Puin, however, sees the need for a \"scientific text\" of the Koran, and this is what he intends to achieve. He says that Muslims believe that \"the Koran has been worked on a thousand years ago\" and \"is not a topic anymore\". </p> <p>Not all Muslim reaction to him has been hostile. Salim Abdullah, director of the German Islamic Archives, affiliated to the powerful pan-Islamic Muslim World League, has given him a positive response. </p> <p>\"He asked me if I could give him the permission to publish one of my articles on the Sa'na manuscripts\", said Puin. Warned of the possible controversy it could raise, he replied: \"I am longing for this kind of discussion on this topic.\"</p>",
  "<p>Kevin Keegan yesterday hit out at the prospect of an England game being shown on pay-per-view television for the first time, a new landmark for this controversial form of broadcasting. </p> <p>The live rights to the World Cup qualifier against Finland in Helsinki on October 11 have been bought by U-Direct TV, which means viewers will have to pay around \u00a310 to see it.</p> <p>The decision to sell the rights to U-Direct was taken by the Finnish FA as the host federation and the Football Association was powerless to intervene although it will be contacting its Helsinki counterpart to check whether something can be done to reverse it.</p> <p>According to the company, the agreement has definitely been signed, and the England coach for one was less than happy at the prospect of a limited audience for the game. \"I am [against it] for the national side, definitely,\" he said. \"I think it should be available for everybody and I feel that about all the major events, to be honest.</p> <p>\"I don't think you should have to buy one of these or have one of those to get it because it is our national sport. But it is Finland's game.\"</p> <p>According to the FA spokesman Adrian Bevington: \"As the host nation the Finns are empowered to make such a decision without any input from ourselves. When brokering our own TV contracts it is always a fundamental aim to provide as large a viewing audience as possible.\"</p> <p>In fact, the FA sold the rights to England's home World Cup qualifiers to BSkyB which scores much lower viewing figures than terrestrial channels.</p> <p>U-Direct, a company owned by Pearson Television, Deutsche Bank and Nomura International, is estimated to have paid \u00a31m for the rights, although one source put the figure as high as \u00a32.7m.</p> <p>Roger Hall, U-Direct's marketing director, defended the project. \"This is a first, but the sports rights market is a competitive one and we are not the first people to charge for watching sports on TV. What we are doing is not new, we are just charging in a different way.\"</p> <p>\"Chrysalis will produce the programme but we will have a full support team in the studio and an on-site commentary team.\"</p> <p>U-Direct will use the Sky Sports Digital channel for its broadcast, with highlights made available to terrestial channels the same evening. Although this will be the first England game shown live on pay-per-view, three Nationwide League games were aired using this method on BSkyB 18 months ago. The season after next NTL plans to show 40 Premiership games using pay-per-view.</p>",
  "<p>After four days of international cricket at its best, the Manchester weather had the final say in the destiny of the third Test yesterday. Having given England a minimum of 71 overs to make 293 to win after a declaration posted shortly past noon, West Indies had their ambitions thwarted by an opening stand of 61 from Mike Atherton and Marcus Trescothick, and by the curtains of drizzle that drifted across the ground. </p> <p>There was some glowering and glaring from Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose as they cranked the pace up in a last-ditch effort to sneak an unlikely victory, but realistically, once the England openers had survived the early challenges, it became little more than a matter of scoring points to take forward to the fourth Test at Headingley on Thursday week. </p> <p>Bad light brought proceedings to an end at 5.20 with England having reached 80 for one, of which Trescothick had made 38 with Nasser Hussain, badly dropped at the wicket off Walsh when one, on six. </p> <p>The series remains tied at one match apiece, but there was a reminder too that Test match cricket is not just a one-act play. This match contained some exceptional performances: Alec Stewart's vivid century on his 100th appearance matched by Brian Lara's immaculate effort on Sunday; Darren Gough's wonderful fast bowling in the first innings, and that from Walsh and Ambrose, which matched their own highest standards; Hussain's phenomenal catch to dismiss Ambrose and his instinctive run-out of Lara; Walsh's incredible slower ball first up to Graham Thorpe which so bamboozled the batsman on his return to Test cricket that he sat in the dressing room and laughed at the absurdity of it; and Trescothick's debut, which brought him 104 runs for once out and which, from an England perspective, was the most significant feature of the match. </p> <p>Trescothick was placed in the furnace again yesterday and survived intact, displaying the admirably unflappable temperament and solid technique that had brought him to notice in the triangular tournament. Perhaps that tournament came at the right time, allowing him to display his credentials in one-day games without fear of failure. Credit then to those who identified his potential and had the presence of mind to pick him. A part of the next generation appears to be in place. </p> <p>Yesterday when Walsh and Ambrose brought all the toys out of the box he was equal to the task and, with Atherton, made sure that there was no early breakthrough to give West Indies the sniff of a chance. Walsh finally snared Atherton, caught at the wicket for 28, to give him his 23rd wicket of the series and was urgently seeking his 24th when the draw was agreed. </p> <p>By and large, although they suffered as West Indies racked up 438 for seven in their second innings, it was a good, workmanlike performance from an England team that is growing in confidence match by match. The top six have a look of authority all the way down (although Hussain's miserable run of scores continues) and the pace bowling, led by Gough, has a classy look to it, even if Andy Caddick's capacity to wilt when under the cosh appears undiminished. </p> <p>The surprise package was Craig White, who bowled with genuine pace and skill, particularly when reverse-swinging the old ball to left-handers from around the wicket. The part he might play in Pakistan this winter, where reverse swing is a must, should not be underestimated. </p> <p>The disappointment was Robert Croft's offspin. Here he was presented with a pitch that turned and the pressure was on him to exploit it. He was expected to take wickets and figures of one for 124 from 47 overs do not indicate a success. </p> <p>There is little doubt that a spinner will be superfluous to requirements at Headingley, and a seventh batsman or all-rounder will come into the reckoning for that match, but the character of Oval pitches on which Saqlain Mushtaq and Ian Salisbury take so many wickets for Surrey has changed. England might well want two spinners there for the final Test, but will think long and hard as to whether Croft should be one of them. </p> <p>West Indies can take encouragement from the match. A little more than a month ago they were humiliated at Lord's, bowled out for 54 when they had the match under control, and their performances in the one-day tournament were less than adequate. </p> <p>But they fought back superbly here, not just through Lara's brilliance and that of Walsh and Ambrose, but through Jimmy Adams's diligence, and a return to something like form for Adrian Griffith. There was a statement of sorts too in the way that Wavell Hinds and then Lara pulled the short ball with gusto after the feeble attempts to cope with it at Lord's. </p> <p>The back-up bowling remains poor, however, with Reon King and Franklyn Rose appearing to have neither the skill nor the appetite to take over the mantle from Walsh and Ambrose.</p>",
  "<p>Bureaucrats are ever on the lookout for new methods with which to bully and intimidate the public, and a friend of mine recently drew my attention to one such new method: the medical questionnaire. </p> <p>My friend had just done some non-medical consultancy work for the NHS executive in the West Midlands, and was asked by letter whether she would like to join a list of consultants to be considered for future similar work on behalf of the Birmingham Women's Hospital trust. If so, would she fill out a medical questionnaire? </p> <p>This turned out to be nine pages long, and included such questions as: \"Do you wear glasses/contact lenses?\" and \"Have you suffered any 'funny turns' in the last year?\" Needless to say, my friend (who does wear glasses) wondered whether this would count for or against her. </p> <p>She wrote to the occupational health department to point out that, apart from having grown older by one year, her health was exactly the same as when she started her last work for the executive - when she had not been asked to fill out such a form - and that while she was willing to undergo a medical examination if required, she was not willing to answer intrusive questions that she regarded as irrelevant. She received a reply from an \"occupational health adviser\", which started with the immortal sentence: \"The policy at the Birmingham Women's Hospital is to complete health questionnaires on application of posts.\" </p> <p>Needless to say, only incompetents, cowards and people with a guilty conscience write English like this, and my friend replied that the trust was perfectly welcome to fill as many questionnaires as it liked. However, she wanted to know why she was required to fill the form when she had ceased working for the executive only two months previously, and when the consultancy work was only hypothetical in any case. </p> <p>A reply from the occupational health physician himself was written in the kind of clotted English people write when defending a position not because they are convinced of it but because they are part of an organisation: \"My assumption is that the reason you have been sent a questionnaire is that the Women's trust require you to have either an honourary contract or in some other way wish to check your health status prior to your working with the trust, with their staff or on their patients.\" </p> <p>He added helpfully that the questionnaire \"is agreed as being an appropriate screening questionnaire\" (a case of one hand clapping if ever there was one), and concluded: \"At present my recommendation would have to be that you are not fit to carry out any work on behalf of the trust until such time as we have received the questionnaire.\" </p> <p>It is nice to know, of course, that merely filling in an occupational health questionnaire will bind up wounds and make the lame whole again, thus rendering a person fit for work, but my friend nevertheless replied: \"I am interested to know whether it is the trust's policy to require all contractors to complete health questionnaires - for example computer personnel and window cleaners?\" </p> <p>The occupational health physician had also stated in his letter that \"the information remains wholly confidential within the occupational health department and is not released to any other party\", to which my friend naturally replied by asking what use, then, it could possibly be to the personnel department that was considering her application for employment? </p> <p>In fact, the assertion that the information was in all circumstances confidential was a bare-faced lie, for at the beginning of the questionnaire we find the following sinister words: \"Failure to disclose information fully or accurately may lead to termination of employment.\" Since it is unlikely that the occupational health department would fire people, it is clear that the information must sometimes be passed to the personnel department, that is to say it is not confidential in the least, and was never intended to be confidential. </p> <p>Indeed, it seems to me likely that the whole purpose of so detailed a questionnaire is to ensure that every applicant for a job tells at least one lie which might subsequently be used as a reason to dismiss him. It is, in effect, an undated letter of resignation. </p> <p>Besides, it is characteristic of these days of ideological non-discrimination that in practice the most blatant discrimination is routinely found. (My epileptic patients, for example, cannot find jobs even when their epilepsy is completely irrelevant to the task in hand.) And once a policy is a policy, nothing at all can be done about it. It has become a natural fact, like the climate. </p> <p>What the public needs, therefore, is a policy policy: non-cooperation with any policy whose sole justification is that it is a policy.</p>",
  "<p>It was not until I was 24, six years ago, that I was diagnosed, by a psychiatrist in New York, with Tourette syndrome (TS) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), TS's frequent - often more debilitating - partner in crime. Because of the way I look, and what most people know (or don't know, rather) about these conditions, you would never assign these labels to me unless you were told of them in advance. Even then I would probably be able to hide anything out of the ordinary and prevent you from believing the truth. After all, I've been doing just that - passing for normal - for most of my life. </p> <p>Before I was 10, my first tic appeared - a quick, firm head jerk that usually occurred in sets of two. For weeks, maybe longer, I was able to keep it a secret. Soon, however, the girls in my ballet class noticed it, then my sister, and finally - in spite of my best efforts to hide it from them - my parents, who promptly set up an appointment with my affable if geriatric paediatrician. As I sat in his familiar office, eyeing the full basket of candy on his desk and smiling prettily as my ears were checked for possible infection, inside I was as tightly wound as a turn-of-the-century timepiece, literally willing my body not to move. When the doctor handed me a cherry lollipop and reassured my mother that I was absolutely fine - \"perfectly normal\" - I smiled triumphantly and excused myself to use the ladies' room, where I jerked my head so severely, as a release from the pressure of keeping so still, that I heard a crack like a gunshot. </p> <p>After that first tic, I endured hundreds more, while increasing my ability to conceal them from the people around me, especially my father, whose shock at this development in his otherwise perfect child was nearly as great as my own. The truth is that even now, no one - not any member of my family, any friend, any colleague, my husband - has ever seen the full extent of my physical tics. I'm not sure I could catalogue them in their entirety myself. Over the past two decades I have jerked my head sideways to varying degrees, thrust my chin forward or drawn it into my neck, shifted my lower jaw from side to side or back and forth, rolled my eyes to the outer corners of their sockets, clicked my back teeth in patterns, clenched my hands in pulsating fists, flipped my hair out of my face until it was knotty, sniffed furtive little rabbit sniffs, cleared my throat in quiet little coughs, flexed my wrists up and out, and rotated my shoulder blades, as though I were trying to make them meet in the middle of my back. </p> <p>Although these outward manifestations of what is, in my opinion, largely an inward condition, caused me physical pain and embarrassment, what went on in my head was much harder to control, suppress or explain. Even before I developed tics, I counted to myself, off and on, throughout each day, always to six and back. Sixes were good, threes were bad; in fact, even numbers in general were - and remain - vastly preferable to odd ones. It is hard to explain the pervasive nature of this rule, which affected not just objects or words, but how I walked, talked, coughed, even thought. When I was under duress or overtired I would count ideas - after six in an hour I had to clear my head by repeating my name (A-my S Wil-en-sky - six syllables) until the hour was up, allowing me six more ideas. </p> <p>At around the age of 12, I became obsessed with death, with illness, and monitored my temperature and blood pressure in a notebook for years, although I was physically as healthy as a horse. I meticulously researched diseases, such as encephalitis and lymphoma, and often convinced myself I had the symptoms, such as a swollen brain or painful lymph nodes. I invented elaborate rituals, such as complicated counting patterns, to keep myself safe from my limitless fears. And also as a protective measure against unspecified disaster, I started to hoard. For years, I saved: movie ticket stubs, gum wrappers, fortunes from fortune cookies, pennies, paper clips, safety pins, toothpicks and receipts, even from purchases of less than a dollar. </p> <p>In short, I was a mess. In my teenage years it took me 10 minutes to get from our front door to my bedroom due to all my walking and touching rituals. I managed to fight my way through adolescence, hoping that I would wake up one morning free from the burden I called my \"habits\". It was not until I was in graduate school that I was able to confront the possibility that something diagnosable - maybe even treatable - was wrong with me. When I mustered up the courage to consult a psychiatrist, he shook my hand. \"Congratulations,\" he said, \"I'm amazed you waited this long.\" </p> <p>Tourette syndrome is not, as it is nearly always portrayed in the media, a \"swearing disease\". About 10% of sufferers have coprolalia, the clinical term for vocal tics; that means 90% are afflicted primarily with physical tics, like mine, to varying degrees of severity. Physical tics, a fact to which I am living testimony, can be easy to mask or diffuse. In fact, I have met dozens of men and women who were middle-aged or older before being diagnosed with TS. Many sufferers, like me, were diagnosed in their 20s, after the worst of the condition had manifested itself. </p> <p>In medical terms, TS is a chronic neurobiological disorder of the central nervous system caused by abnormalities in neuro transmitters - dopamine and serotonin - that control the body's movements by sending messages across gaps between nerve cells called synapses. Obsessive-compulsive disorder, also a neurobiological and not a psychological condition, causes its sufferers to perform a wide range of compulsions in order to negate the anxiety caused by various obsessions, such as mine with death. OCD is much more prevalent than TS as a distinct disorder but is found in the majority of those with TS as an integrated component. </p> <p>Once I was diagnosed, I began regular sessions with an expert and started on medication: haloperidol (Haldol), a tic-suppressor that blocks the dopamine receptors in the brain, for the Tourette's, and fluoxetine (Prozac), a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, for the OCD. I began behavioural therapy, where I chipped away, bit by tiny bit, at the obsessions and rituals that I now accepted had stolen hours every day. </p> <p>The behavioural therapy was like learning to read, or ride a bike: for months the whole enterprise seemed insurmountable and then suddenly, after a gum wrapper screwed up in the trash can here, a cup of iced coffee with five ice cubes there, a brick fell out of the dam, the dam crumbled and was swept away by the current, and shortly after I couldn't imagine why on earth I'd started saving gum wrappers in the first place. The drugs were less successful, although they had the desired effects - after a year on each I chose my familiar enemy over the strange and uncomfortable side effects. I still prefer an occasional ticcing bout to pervasive lethargy, although I will certainly consider the new generation of medications being developed when they come out, if I feel the need. </p> <p>Today, although some of the more deeply-ingrained tics and rituals do creep back in times of stress, I am largely free from the burdens they imposed for so long on my body and mind. As an adult, with a career, a husband, a social life, I savour the regained hours in each day, hours I used to spend, say, putting all the correspondence I had ever received - including notes - in chronological order. Overall, I feel amused by many of my former rules, much less beholden to the few that remain. Most of the time, I throw things away like anybody else: old magazines, empty boxes and bags, insignificant receipts. With age, as is usually the case with TS, my physical tics have lessened in intensity and reduced in frequency to an entirely manageable extent. Almost always now, waiting for the bus, sitting at a cafe, walking down the street, I not only look normal, I feel so. </p> <p>Although I never set out to become a spokesperson for TS and OCD, my memoir has made me one. At first, this made me extremely uncomfortable. I felt neither compelled nor equipped to speak for others, whose experiences in general and with these conditions may have been totally different from my own. But the responses I receive to my story are so unpredictable - and so often delightful - that I would not trade my journey for the world. Perhaps my favourite so far was that of my husband's 83-year-old grandmother, an upright, churchgoing lifelong midwesterner, who upon reading my book said to me, while giving me an enormous hug, \"Passing for normal, eh? That's what we're all doing, I suppose. Every last one of us.\" </p> <p>Passing for Normal by Amy Wilensky, published by Scribner at \u00a39.99, will be available from August 14.</p>",
  "Chile's supreme court confirmed today that it has stripped former dictator General Augusto Pinochet of immunity, clearing the way for a trial, lawyers from both sides said. The justices voted a week ago but kept their decision secret until the legal ruling had been confirmed in writing. The news that the vote had gone against the general was leaked last week, but until today's confirmation it would technically have been possible for some judges to change their minds, affecting the verdict. <p>Gen Pinochet had appealed against a lower court tribunal in June stripping him of the immunity he had as a senator-for-life, a post he created for himself in the constitution written by his 1973-90 dictatorship. </p> <p>Trying the 84-year-old retired general on human rights charges could take up to eight years, said Eduardo Contreras, a lawyer who opened the long judicial process against Gen Pinochet by filing the first of 157 criminal complaints in 1998. </p> <p>His colleague Hugo Gutierrez agreed, saying Gen Pinochet was unlikely to go to jail. Mr Gutierrez represents one of several plaintiffs in the case that has taken Gen Pinochet closer to a court of justice that anybody could have imagined only months ago. </p> <p>Police said they were stepping up security around the court building to keep pro-and anti-Pinochet demonstrators one block apart and behind metal crowd-control fences. </p> <p>President Ricardo Lagos, a socialist who was briefly jailed under Gen Pinochet, called for calm and urged everyone to respect the ruling.</p> <p>The next step would be to turn the case over to Judge Juan Guzman, who would preside over the trial. Judge Guzman still faces a number of obstacles to getting the proceeding moving. </p> <p>The first is a medical examination. Because of Gen Pinochet's age, doctors must determine whether he is fit to stand trial. </p> <p>The general's relatives and lawyers say the former ruler objects to the checkup. They say he fears that if doctors find him unfit for reasons of mental health, that could tarnish his historical image. Gen Pinochet is known to be in poor physical condition. He suffers from diabetes, has a pacemaker and has sustained three mild strokes. </p> <p>After the medical exam, Gen Pinochet still has opportunities to drag the process out. As a retired army general, he has the right to refuse being questioned in person and respond only in writing, which lawyers say would slow the trial down. </p> <p>Gen Pinochet would face charges relating to one of the most notorious human rights abuses during his 17-year-reign, the so-called caravan of death, a military squad that executed 72 political prisoners shortly after Gen Pinochet's 1973 coup. Nineteen of those victims remain unaccounted for. </p> <p>According to a government report, 3,197 people were killed for political reasons during Gen Pinochet's regime, including more than 1,000 who were made \"disappear\".</p>",
  "<p>In that boisterous, artfully crusty way of his, Sir Robin Day would have chuckled to hear that his death was the lead item on the Six O'Clock News on Radio 4 and on many television news bulletins last night. </p> <p>\"It must be a slow news day,\" he would have muttered, and he would have been correct. A consummate news junkie, devouring newsprint, books, magazines and TV for nearly 50 professional years, he knew all too well how his trade worked. </p> <p>Despite his fame, he was a modest man who felt he had not achieved all that he might have. </p> <p>At least in part, the key may lie in a half-forgotten detail of his long career. In the general election of 1959 he stood for parliament in the Liberal interest at Hereford. In Harold Macmillan's 100-seat landslide he was beaten, by 17,763 votes to 10,185, by an Etonian farmer, David Gibson-Watt. </p> <p>In a long career Mr Gibson-Watt did not unduly draw attention to himself. Day, already well-known as \"a television news commentator and journalist\" (his description in the 1959 Times election guide), went on to become a household name, first at Panorama, later in his decade as the incomparable host of BBC TV's Question Time - a \"stop-gap\" programme which grabbed 7m viewers. </p> <p>And yet he would tell friends in his old age that he would have traded the lot to be \"the humblest of backbenchers\". He spent a lot of time in the Commons press gallery, more than modern Paxmans would do. It was another reason why politicians saw him as one of their own, despite the frequent on-camera rows. </p> <p>His romanticism may also explain the extrovert's bow tie, the booming voice, the bufferish exterior which, as with other shy men, covered inner insecurities and made them an asset. Within three years of joining ITN he was interviewing the likes of Egypt's Colonel Nasser and - a television first - grilling prime minister Harold Macmillan in 1958. </p> <p><strong> Growing up</strong><br> </p> <p> In fact Day symbolised the growing up of British television journalism, as countless colleagues and victims, including Margaret Thatcher and John Humphrys, acknowledged last night. ITN got off its knees with politicians and forced the BBC to follow suit. </p> <p>David Dimbleby, one of Day's successors at Panorama, just as Dimbleby's father, Richard, had preceded Day, said last night that Day combined \"a barrister's training, a theatrical instinct and an absolute belief in the right to know\". That is exactly right. </p> <p>Like Winston Churchill he realised early on the value of the trademark bow tie. In the ultimate thespian tribute, he was invited to appear with Des O'Connor and with Morecambe and Wise, all of whom he admired. </p> <p>Yet this was a deeply serious man who, in his autobiography, Grand Inquisitor, wrote that \"a television interview with a prime minister should be a constructive contribution to the democratic process, a dialogue which will clarify and illuminate\". </p> <p>That sounds less fun than it usually was. Day was magisterial (he did his homework very thoroughly) but he was also fun. \"Why should a man of your social position, charm and personality have to go to whores for sex,\" he asked Lord Lampton after the junior minister in Edward Heath's government was found to have bedded two prostitutes at once. Such questions were not asked on TV in the early 1970s, nor answered. Yet Lampton (wearing dark glasses) replied that most men would jump at the chance. </p> <p>One of Day's raised eyebrows or his lawyer's putdown remark was often enough to deflate most evasive ministers, as last night's celebrated clip of John Nott's walkout from a studio recalled. </p> <p>Why should viewers not believe a serving naval officer about defence cuts rather than \"a transient, here today and - if I may say so - gone tomorrow politician\", Day asked. As Nott, then defence secretary, swept out, Day could be heard saying: \"Thank you, Mr Nott.\" </p> <p>Politicians knew that he was box office. They liked and respected him, though in 1987 Mrs Thatcher put him in his place by referring to Sir Robin throughout as \"Mr Day\". He could hand it out and, rather rarer, could take it too. </p> <p>Once when he asked Mrs Thatcher whether she intended to sack some ministers, she replied: \"You are going further than I wish to go.\" \"Well naturally, that's part of my job, prime minister,\" he replied. \"Yes indeed, it's part of my job to try to stop you,\" she countered. </p> <p>He could be charming to younger colleagues, though not always. \"What did you think?\" he asked one after a big interview. When the man said the subject appeared to say nothing new, Day retorted: \"Not the answers, you fool, the questions.\" </p> <p>With hindsight, the tragedy of his later life was the BBC's decision to replace him with a younger man, Peter Sissons, on Question Time in 1989 when Day was 66 and had a lot of mileage left in him. It was a mistake on both sides. He had already applied unsuccessfully to be the director-general of the BBC in 1976, the old hankering to be a man of action. He had made less money than he thought (\"I now know capital is freedom, high income is slavery,\" he confessed) and had time on his hands. It seemed clear he was sometimes lonely. </p> <p>He lived alone in a flat near the Commons and usually lunched on the lawyers' table at his beloved Garrick Club, 10 minutes away in a taxi. William Rees-Mogg, the ex-editor of the Times, was a chum; so was Sir Stephen Tumin, the ex-chief inspector of prisons, once master of St Edmund Hall, Day's old Oxford college. </p> <p>He kept up with the law and read political biography avidly. Day grew more conservative as he grew older and, like most people in most professions, frequently expressed the view that television, and politics, were going to the dogs. By his exacting standards he was right about that, too. </p> <p> <strong>A Day in the life</strong><br></p> <p><strong> Born:</strong> 24 October 1923 </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> read law at St Edmund Hall, Oxford University 1947-51; president of the Oxford union in 1950. </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> called to Bar in 1952 but resigned after a year.

  "<p><strong>Oliver Twist (1948)</strong><br> After co-starring as Herbert Pocket in David Lean's earlier Dickens adaptation, Great Expectations, Guinness rose to fame in the classic Oliver Twist. Aged 34, the actor hid under a straggly wig and heavy prosthetics to give a barnstorming performance as the weaselly Fagin. But the role attracted controversy too. So potent was Guinness that Lean's film was immediately banned in both Israel and Egypt. Israel objected to what it perceived as the actor's anti-semitic portrait of Fagin. The Egyptian authorities, conversely, felt that Guinness had made him far too sympathetic.</p> <p><strong>Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) </strong><br> Robert Hamer's dark class-war comedy remains the film that effectively branded Guinness on the public consciousness. The nominal star was Dennis Price's impoverished heir, but Guinness stole the show: split into eight different roles as the collected members of the wealthy d'Ascoyne family. His turn as the posh suffragette who \"fell to earth in Berkeley Square\" occupies a niche on comic history, while the news that Robin Williams is currently planning a remake (in the Guinness role) amounts to a kind of cinematic sacrilege.</p> <p><strong>The Man in the White Suit (1951) </strong><br> Guinness took an altogether more subtle and restrained starring role in this keen Ealing outing from Alexander Mackendrick. He plays the lowly dishwasher at a textile-mill, whose brilliant new invention - a fabric that never needs washing - enrages his profiteering bosses. The film's gentle line in comedy masks a harsh attack on industrial corruption, if not the entire capitalist system.</p> <p><strong>The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) </strong><br> The Lavender Hill Mob cast Guinness alongside Stanley Holloway as a pair of underdog bullion robbers who plan the perfect crime. Like Oliver Twist, this expert, anarchic comedy found itself banned in various nations, including the then British-governed Rhodesia. Explaining the decision, Tory minister John Profumo (yes, that John Profumo) told the Commons that \"the film was declared unsuitable for African audiences because it contained scenes likely to encourage a disrespect for law and order\".</p> <p><strong>The Ladykillers (1955) </strong><br> The last great Ealing comedy found Guinness (beneath lank hair and behind buck-teeth) as the sleazy ringleader of a bunch of criminals lying low at the home of a innocent old dame (Katie Johnson). A huge hit on its release, the film prompted the Daily Express to claim that \"aside from Scotch whisky, Mr Alec Guinness is the best export to America we have got\".</p> <p><strong>Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) </strong><br> Guinness bagged an Oscar for his starring role in David Lean's peerless wartime spectacular; a picture that went on to become the year's biggest box-office hit and one of the most namechecked war movies of all time. \"Guinness etches an unforgettable portrait of the typical British army officer: strict, didactic and serene in his adherence to the book,\" wrote Variety.</p> <p><strong>Our Man in Havana (1960) </strong><br> Directed by Carol (The Third Man) from the story by Graham Greene, Our Man in Havana was a pungent Cold War satire, with Guinness as the vacuum-cleaner salesman in pre-Revolutionary Cuba turned mischief-making British spy. The tale's use of military blueprints foreshadowed the later Cuba missile crisis, while Guinness's role seemed to prefigure his acclaimed 80s turn as the spy Smiley on BBC TV.</p> <p><strong>Tunes of Glory (1960) </strong><br> It was originally intended for Guinness to play the role of the upstanding English officer who takes over a Highland regiment, and John Mills the drunken colonel who was already based there. In the end the two actors elected to swap roles - to powerful effect. \"That colonel was the best role he ever gave,\" claims Mills today, \"because it was the antithesis of Alec.\"</p> <p><strong>Lawrence of Arabia (1962) </strong><br> Although Guinness was forced to play second-fiddle to Peter O'Toole, David Lean's grand camel-opera gave the 48-year-old actor another opportunity for some chameleon-like acting, gaining an Oscar-nomination as Arab leader Prince Feisal. The film itself scooped the Best Picture Oscar and was hailed by Pauline Kael as \"one of the most tasteful and exciting of spectaculars\".</p> <p><strong>Star Wars (1977) </strong><br> Guinness would later dismiss his stint as Obi Wan on Star Wars as his most miserable movie experience, and claimed that he binned all the resulting fan-mail. But Lucas's intrepid space adventure showcased the ageing actor for a whole new generation and made him a multi-millionaire to boot - a share of the profits gained him an estimated \u00a3120m (\"divide that by 20 and you might be nearer the mark,\" said Guinness). In 1999's The Phantom Menace, the role of the young Obi Wan was played by Ewan McGregor, who studied old Guinness movies to perfect the right vocal impression.</p> <p>\u0095<strong> <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/features/picturestory/0,6412,351451,00.html\">Images from some of Guinness's greatest roles</a></strong></p>",

  "<p>Author J K Rowling has admitted she's nervous about the <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0241527\">Harry Potter</a> movie Hollywood is making (see our earlier <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,84738,00.html\">report</a>) but has promised fans that she will do everything she can to keep it true to the book. The British writer admits she does not have much control over what happens with the movie, but is being regularly asked for her opinion.</p> <p>She says, \"I am nervous because I'm fighting tooth and nail to maintain the purity trying to make sure that when things go out with Harry Potter on them, they really are Harry Potter things. Warner Brothers have been very gracious in allowing me input and I have been asked a lot of questions. I never expected to be asked.\" </p> <p>She adds, \"The person I was most nervous about meeting was Steve Kloves, who's writing the screenplay. I was really ready to hate him. This was the man who was gonna butcher my baby. The first time I met him, he said, 'You know who my favourite character is?' and I thought, 'You're gonna say Ron - it's really easy to love Ron, but so obvious.'</p> <p>\"But he said, Hermione. I just kind of melted.\"</p>",
  "Cherie Booth QC, the prime minister's wife, was yesterday accused of becoming \"an unaccountable cross between First Lady and Lady Macbeth\" after co-authoring a newspaper article in defence of the new Human Rights Act. <p>The attack was launched, with the apparent support of Conservative Central Office, by John Bercow, MP for Buckingham and a newly-appointed member of Ann Widdecombe's shadow home affairs team. </p> <p>\"Cherie Blair is breaking the long-standing convention that prime ministers' spouses do not push their own political agendas. It is unclear whether Cherie's end goal is to be lord chancellor or whether she is happy to direct policy from behind the throne,\" he said. </p> <p>The Tories have had huge problems getting women elected to parliament: of the 122 women MPs, only 14 are Tories and few have been selected to fight winnable seats at the next election. </p> <p>Mr Bercow's attack coincided with a report that the Conservative Policy Forum, the link between Mr Hague and grassroots Tories, had warned him the party was anti-gay and in danger of being out of touch on women's issues and marriage. </p> <p>The MP, who was responding to Ms Booth's article in yesterday's Daily Telegraph, was hitting two targets for the price of one. Tory rightwingers do not like the Human Rights Act which is due to incorporate the European convention on human rights into British domestic law from October 2. </p> <p>Nor, with the exception of Margaret Thatcher, do they like powerful political women, especially clever women lawyers. \"What is clear is that Cherie has a bad dose of Hillary syndrome,\" Mr Bercow said. </p> <p>Mrs Blair has spoken out in favour of family-friendly employment policies, job shares and stronger protection against sex and gender harassment. </p> <p>Yesterday Tory HQ issued a five-page statement highlighting \"the increasing public profile of Cherie Booth QC\" on such issues, suggesting she may follow Mrs Clinton in seeking elected office. </p> <p>The reality is more prosaic. Friends believe Ms Booth would like to become a high court judge. That may not be easy while her husband is in No 10. The game plan is said to be that he retires to make money and she makes legal history.</p>",
  "<p>I recently met a man who I'd have to describe as an acid casualty who has never taken acid. He claims to be a film-maker, and has recently directed an instructional video for would-be cult leaders called Mind Control Made Easy. This guy is, naturally, a Nietzschean at heart. And after a few too many beers at a Manhattan microbrewery, he can apply the principles of The Birth of Tragedy to explain his obsession with Britney Spears. \"It's the Dionysian drag of her ass and the Apollonian snap of her breasts that's got me hooked,\" he says. He does not own either of her albums because the drag and the snap have nothing to do with music. </p> <p>As Britney herself would say, Whatever. </p> <p>Like most pop culture phenomena, people's fascination with Britney Spears has absolutely nothing to do with what she is purportedly famous for, which is to say, singing and dancing. This is, most understandably, a source of huge frustration for Britney and for many other modern icons: they wish to be famous for their talent. After all, they insist, long before they became a thing, they sang schmaltzy ballads at wedding receptions or acted in soap operas, and were paid to do an honest day's work because they were good at it, not because they were famous, since they were not yet famous. </p> <p>Hence we have a situation wherein Demi Moore wants to be known as a great actress, not as a pregnant woman with a bare belly on the cover of Vanity Fair. Madonna wants us to believe that The Next Best Thing is a good movie, not that she is just a compelling cocoon of public metamorphoses and an occasional advocate of free expression. Marilyn Monroe married Arthur Miller and then more or less died of her desire to be more than a dumb blonde. </p> <p>Occasionally, the person actually does transcend the persona. Cher won an Oscar. Princess Diana devoted herself so thoroughly to international good deeds that, by the time of her death, she was actually thought of as an international do-gooder. But mostly you are left with a situation where Britney Spears can say to Rolling Stone: \"It's not about my personality. People couldn't see me through the radio.\" </p> <p>As if. </p> <p>Since I myself earned more notoriety for being naked on the cover of my book Bitch than for anything I actually wrote in the pages between, I am intrinsically and intuitively sympathetic with the burden of being Britney. It is, no doubt, a pain in the ass to be all tits and ass. But, my God, she is so good at it that I wish she would simply embrace this role and stop trying to deny it. </p> <p>Trouble is, unlike all the other aforementioned icons, Britney Spears's entire appeal is in denying her entire appeal. Unlike, say, Madonna, who never pretended to be anything other than an overtly sexual being, Britney Spears has built an entire image around insisting that she does not mean to be sexy. She can't help it if men get hot and bothered when they see her in a schoolgirl uniform, a plaid micro-mini with thigh-high tights and a top tied just below her breasts, the better to bare her slightly fleshy midriff. She can't help it if guys get excited over pigtails and baby fat, the two main characters in her very first video. And it is not her fault if people with dirty minds think that she is asking to be bent over and spanked when she begs a boy to \"Hit me baby one more time\". It's not her fault that grown-ups don't know that that's just a teenage way of asking a guy to call her pager. </p> <p>The hot pants and push-up bra on her first cover of Rolling Stone were just normal: down south where Britney comes from and sweat is plentiful, no one wears much clothing. The skin-tight vinyl in the video for Oops ... I Did it Again, the python outfit cut down to there and up to there designed especially for her 18th birthday party, the sequinned cleavage top that served as slight support for her absolutely natural bursting breasts at the American Music Awards and the clingy white jumpsuit she performed in at the Grammys are all a fashion statement, a fun day of dress-up for a little girl raiding Mommy's closet. Choosing Gregory Dark, a director of pornographic movies, to make the video for From The Bottom of my Broken Heart was simply an artistic decision, a tribute to his vision. And she cannot be blamed that lesser minds might find her Yorkshire terrier, Baby, and her tour bus full of puffy pillows and scented candles from K-Mart reminiscent of a New Orleans bordello. </p> <p>After all, she told YM magazine that she plans to stay a virgin until she is married, and despite rumours of a heady romance, Britney and Justin Timberlake - of the boy band 'N Sync - have only recently enjoyed their first kiss. She is still a good, Baptist girl from Kentwood, Louisiana, who is saddened that she often cannot find the time to attend church when she is on the road. And, whatever perverted fantasies might pollute the minds of men, most of her albums are purchased by pre-pubescent girls with innocent ears who like to sing along with danceable pop songs and love to imitate Britney's style. </p> <p>In her cover of the Rolling Stones' Satisfaction, lyrics like \"He can't be a man because he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me\" have been excised because Britney Spears would never smoke anything. In another twist on Satisfaction, she even delivers some babe-a-licious feminism: when the girl comes on and tells her \"how tight my skirts should be\", she doesn't pay attention because \"She can't tell me who to be/ I've got my own identity\". And when Britney sings the line, \"I'm not that innocent\", she is just being gamely in a song about playing games. </p> <p>She is a good actress who, like Brooke Shields as an 11-year-old prostitute in Louis Malle's Pretty Baby, does not really know the implications of the part she is playing. \"It's like on TV, if you see Jennifer Love Hewitt or Sarah Michelle Gellar kill someone, do you think they go out and do that?\" she asked in a recent Rolling Stone interview. And she is so good at insisting that she has no idea why more people search the internet for naked pictures of her than for any other celebrity that I must admit that I am not certain that she is in on her own image. Who the hell knows? </p> <p>All this is much too confusing for a simple girl like me. </p> <p>I like bubblegum music as much as the next person - if the next person happens to be 12 years old. But for all the emphasis on how Britney Spears is a product of some wizardly Swedish producers, I find both her albums damn near unlistenable; optically unnerving; jarringly brassy - like having your ears boxed with a pair of large metal cymbals. Her voice is nothing special. If Dear Diary is any indication, she can't write songs to save her life. And yet I admit I am charmed by Britney Spears. If I am confused by her pleas for sexual absolution, I completely believe that she is a sweet, sweet girl who has worked hard and deserves all her success. </p> <p>But there's something wrong with this. After all, sweetness should not sell albums; talent should. And I'm pretty convinced that she has little to none. Christina Aguilera, Britney's main rival for the teenybopper, girl-power audience, has a big, beautiful voice. And I think her song What A Girl Wants is a pretty good argument for boys' deference to female desire. But I can't stand Christina - she has none of the Britney charm, none of the sugar, none of the southern honey. Aguilera's music is less irritating, but her personality is more so. Britney wins on congeniality alone. </p> <p>And who can say that talent is anything so great anyway? Britney Spears's career is basically Debbie Gibson redux, right down to their early days entertaining shoppers as they passed between the Body Shop, the Gap and Laura Ashley in the local malls. Feature for feature, Debbie and Britney look unbelievably alike, neither one a beauty, but both full of cheerleader, popular-girl prettiness that makes them so appealing to teenage girls who can safely aspire to their bottled-blonde good looks. Just as Britney is linked with one of the members of 'N Sync, Debbie was constantly denying rumours that she was dating Jordan from New Kids On The Block. If it were 1988, this essay would be about Debbie Gibson. </p> <p>But instead of pondering her latent sexuality, any article about Gibson would beg the question about why such a talented teenager would be the purveyor of such schlock. After all, Gibson played the piano, had her own studio in the garage of her parents' Long Island home, actually wrote the songs on her albums and acted as her own producer and arranger. When I interviewed her back then, I kept asking her - to no avail - why she was the way she was. I kept saying in frustration that most adolescents with the abilities she had would be rebellious and nasty and would start bands and make a lot of noise, because gifted people usually are rebellious and nasty, and they usually can't curb the urge to make a lot of noise. Why wasn't she into grunge? Why wasn't she bitter and twisted the way talented people are supposed to be? </p> <p>And then I remembered that most riot grrrls have no actual musical talent, and, if they did, maybe they would be producing albums of silly love songs and odes to electric youth, just like Debbie Gibson. I kept confusing the means of production with the meaning behind it. I was a victim of false consciousness. After all, Lesley Gore was also known to write some of her own songs. </p> <p>At any rate, with all her talent, Debbie Gibson is nowhere to be found a decade later. She has done some musical shows, but her attempts to make sexy, adult albums with lushly produced videos by the sensual photographer Matthew Ralston did not result in the record sales that her teenage anthems once racked up. Without the vocal chops to really carry a theatrical career, Deborah Gibson - the name she uses on Broadway marquees - has mostly disappeared. </p> <p>In all likelihood, Britney Spears's fate will be similar. But who knows? Madonna was supposed to be a one-hit-wonder, and now all the prayers of the Church of England could not get rid of her. She has shown us that image-making is itself a genuine talent. Courtney Love was supposed to be a mere footnote to Kurt Cobain's career - but who's sorry now? The truth is, nobody knows the nature of evanescence or the secret of staying power. Come to think of it, nobody really knows why anything is as it is. </p> <p>As it happens, Britney Spears was shockingly funny when she recently hosted the comedy show Saturday Night Live. Playing a hip-hop hoodlum who used to be on The New Mickey Mouse Club and was now dissing Britney Spears, the real Spears was hilarious. She did a perfect self-parody. </p> <p>Or maybe she was just reading her lines. </p> <p>Somebody recently told me that I should get rid of my navel ring. She said it gave men the wrong idea. And, at 33 years old and no longer nubile, I apparently ought not be putting out that vibe. </p> <p>Now, I don't know how it is possible to give men \"the wrong idea\", or even what exactly that is. Probably something about being loose and wild and easy - a sure thing in the sack, shall we say. It's not so innocent. </p> <p>But in truth the main thing I can say about the ruby hoop in my belly button - besides that I like it - is that it hurt like hell to get it pierced. Serious pain. I mean, you cannot imagine. And then, for six months thereafter, we are talking about the kind of infections and assorted health problems of such a vile magnitude that one woman at a cocktail party was moved to warn me that it might lead to infertility. I spent so much time swabbing my poor, pussed-up navel with hypoallergenic soap and alcohol that I started to think it would have been less trouble to adopt a puppy. Or raise a child. </p> <p>But 10 years later, I still love it. </p> <p>Britney Spears recently got her navel pierced. What does it mean in her case? What was she thinking on that day in Hawaii when she and her girlfriends, these clean teens from Bayou country, walked into a tattoo parlour with skeletons everywhere, run by a \"lady who was, like, a devil worshiper or something\" and walked out with holes in their tummies? </p> <p>Actually, it means nothing. The signifier and the signified have gone their separate ways, as is always the case in current semiotic thinking. Men with long hair might vote for Tory MPs, guys with earrings - I mean in both ears - are usually not gay, Princess Zara has a tongue stud, Prince William wears an Eton vest meant to look like something out of Austin Powers, and a ring in the nose is a passing teenage fad that has nothing to do with worshipping Kali or Vishnu. There are hippie capitalists, there are millionaire computer programmers in Silicon Valley with purple hair. And so it has been for quite a while now. What, in this day and age, is really subversive? </p> <p>Is it Britney Spears herself, or the way she seems not to get it? Or is it the wink-wink way in which she appears to be a complete constructor of her own sexiness, feigning innocence? For that matter, is innocence subversive? </p> <p>We went through the light-of-my-life and fire-of-my-loins of Lolita so many years ago that by 1980 the Police could reference Nabokov in Don't Stand so Close to Me with casual knowingness. Just the same, in the United States you can buy a porn magazine called Barely Legal and a teenage pop star's career can still be built on her accidental sexuality. Of course, Humbert Humbert's fantasy about Lolita was predicated on the idea that she is unaware of \"her own lusciousness, that as a nymphet she is almost grubby and boyish\". But later in the book, Lolita - or rather, Dolores - takes the sexual power that Humbert has assigned her and turns it against both of them. By the end, she is a tawdry housewife, and her seducer and tormentor is a ruined man. Lolita did not age very well; awareness destroyed her just as Adam and Eve's eating from the Tree of Knowledge got them expelled from the Garden of Eden. </p> <p>How long can Britney Spears linger in paradise before all of us notice that her eyes were wide shut all along? </p> <p>Elizabeth Wurtzel is the author of Prozac Nation, her latest book is The Bitch Rules (Quartet). Britney Spears's latest single, Lucky, is released on Monday.</p> <p><strong>Rough guide to Britney by Jemima Sissons</strong></p> <p>Born December 2, 1981, in Kentwood Louisiana to a tightknit baptist family.

  "Like party-goers on the morning after, Whitehall departments are wondering just what they signed up to during Gordon Brown's orgy the other week. His largesse comes with strings attached - public service agreements (PSAs), contracts between ministers and the Treasury to deliver. <p>PSAs are not new. Mark I was launched in December 1998, to run from April 1999 to March 2002. Too many, too artificial, critics said. Only a third of them referred to what government does (outputs) rather than how it does it (processes). Too many, the former Labour MP and spending expert John Garrett snorted, were boring: who cares about civil servants' sick leave? </p> <p>Mark II is also a mixed bunch. By 2004, the Treasury tells the Department for Education and Employment, school truancy should be cut by 10% compared with 2002; at least 38% of 16-year-olds have by then to pass at least five GCSEs at grades A* to C. There is to be a one-tenth reduction in the number of pregnant mums who smoke. By 2004, 17% of household waste is either to be recycled or composted. By 2002, the satisfaction of victims of crime with their treatment by the criminal justice system is to improve by 5%. </p> <p>That one is worth re-reading. Can \"satisfaction\" be so easily measured? A single event - the Tony Martin case, say - could have lasting effects on perceptions of the fairness of courts and the law. </p> <p>Some PSAs turn out to be redescriptions of what Whitehall is doing, but dressed up in pseudo-precise language. The Foreign Office promises to oversee \"the launch of a new broad-based liberalising trade round\". That is not a target. It is highly controversial policy-making, as recent argument about the ideology behind the World Trade Organisation shows. </p> <p>The problem with PSAs is not just methodology. Targets only work if somebody can be fingered if they are not met. So is Gordon Brown now to sit in judgment on his cabinet colleagues' performance? Or his own? Take the targets now set for Sure Start, the ambitious programme to improve life chances for pre-school children from poor families. One is to \"reduce the number of children aged 0-3 in Sure Start areas living in households where no one is working\" - by 2004. This depends on macroeconomic circumstance. But who is responsible for economic prosperity if not the chancellor of the exchequer (ie the Treasury itself) and the monetary policy committee of the Bank of England? It is a bit harsh for the Treasury to say the only people responsible for this PSA are public health minister Yvette Cooper and David Blunkett. </p> <p>Last week Giles Radice led the majority on the Commons' Treasury committee in recommending that PSAs should be monitored by someone other than the Treasury, perhaps the audit commission and the national audit office. These bodies are presented as the ultimate citizens above suspicion, neutral experts on spending. But is there such a thing? The audit commission has its own set of targets and injunctions as to good behaviour by the local authorities it supervises. To check councils are delivering this Best Value programme, there is a separate army of inspectors. What happens if they overlap or even conflict with the PSAs which the Treasury has now extended to councils? </p> <p>The NAO is the executive arm of the public accounts committee, which is chaired by a partisan Tory, David Davies. He has shown signs of wanting to use the office to score party points rather than develop tools for understanding why good intentions do not always turn into effective programmes of public spending. </p> <p>The NAO annual report claimed that it has saved the taxpayer \u00a31.3bn over the past three years. But that is only 0.21% of the \u00a3600bn of the spending it audited - where are its \"targets\"? The NAO, like the audit commission, cannot quite decide whether its principal job is to be bookkeeping, making sure money is properly accounted for, or asking hard analytical questions about the very purpose of spending. </p> <p>That quickly embroils you in political argument for which accountants and civil servants are unsuited. Even harder, the critics may have to suggest better ways in which spending can be delivered. The UK administrative system is crawling with inspectors, auditors and, now, connoisseurs of PSAs and targets; it lacks for people who do. Who is going to tell those pregnant mums to quit smoking? Who is going to turn around a failing school or renew the litter-strewn estate? Taking money away from an under-performing hospital doesn't make political sense. </p> <p>Mr Brown's spending plans expose the gap between ministers' intentions and the sharp end. The PSAs for councils are being tried out in seven areas, including Camden and Warwickshire. They are based on bribery: local authorities get extra if they perform. The problem is that councils are not dogs in Pavlov's experiments, salivating on cue. They are complex groupings of public, politicians and officials, professionals and amateurs. Labour favours active social policies which involve changing the way people behave. Can a PSA capture the tricky business of exhortation, incentive and rule-making by which that target on smoking in pregnancy could be realised? </p> <p>The case for PSAs is that without objectives, the ship of state will drift. But make them too detailed and you risk burdening those who should be out there serving the public with excessive form-filling; alternatively, they will simply be ignored. </p> <p> Treasury committee 9th report can be read at www. publications.parliament.uk <a href=\"maildo:david.walker@theguardian.com\">david.walker@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Business as usual on the French road network yesterday: in the early morning a coach overturned on the A71 near Vierzon, killing a 15-year-old British schoolboy and badly injuring four other people. French police are considering the possibility that the Scottish driver fell asleep at the wheel. <p>Then at two in the afternoon, for reasons as yet unknown, a heavy goods lorry ploughed through the central safety barrier of the A7 outside Valence and slammed into a truck travelling in the opposite direction. The drivers, both French, were killed instantly, as was the young daughter of one of them who was riding with him in the cab. </p> <p>A couple of hours later, the driver of an army truck carrying 20 foreign legionnaires apparently lost control of his vehicle and drove into a tree near Castelnaudary in the south of France. Four young soldiers died and seven others were seriously injured. </p> <p>These were dramatic accidents, and the one involving the British coach -- which was carrying 38 children and eight adults from Scotland and Essex to a week's canoeing, raft-building, abseiling and windsurfing holiday in southern France -- made headlines here as well as in Britain. </p> <p>Armand Jung, a French socialist MP, has renewed calls for an outright ban on overnight coach journeys, citing statistics that show the worst road accidents occur between 2am and 7am. \"Tour operators just want to save a night's hotel bills, so the passengers sleep on the coach,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, so do the drivers, even if they take shifts at the wheel.\" </p> <p>But French road accident statistics show a lot more than that. The busiest weekend of the year, when July holidaymakers returning home cross August vacationers heading south, was relatively accident-free this year thanks to some 400 miles of tailbacks around the country. </p> <p>The three spring Bank Holiday weekends, however, clocked up 271 dead and more than 5,000 injured. On average, one person (1.037, to be exact) dies every hour on a French road. Since 1945, almost as many French people have been killed in cars as died in the second world war. </p> <p>In fact, France's roads are more dangerous than those of any other country in Europe except Greece and Portugal, where surfaces tend to be lousy and cars old. In 1998, there were 144 French road fatalities per million inhabitants, compared with 117 Italian, 93 German and 58 British. </p> <p>Even Isabelle Massin, who heads the government's inter-ministerial working group on road safety, is not optimistic. \"The average French person does not take driving offences seriously,\" she said. \"We have never had such tough road legislation, but French society just does not react. Murderous driving is a French disease.\" </p> <p>The main cause of this mass slaughter is well known: the French still drink and drive, and they do it more than anyone else in Europe. Alcohol is the most important factor in more than 30% of fatal French road accidents, a proportion that has not changed in 20 years. In Britain over the same period, it has halved. </p> <p>According to the statistics, the French also gaily ignore speed limits, red lights and stop signs more frequently than all their European neighbours, and somehow neglect to fasten their seatbelts as often. </p> <p>University sociologists looking for an explanation for such behaviour have seized on one interesting fact: the worst danger on French roads is posed not by the young hothead but by the middle to upper-level executive, aged 35 to 50 and driving a fast, expensive car. </p> <p>The authoritative daily, Le Monde, recently argued that with people like this -- adult, responsible citizens -- heading the accident statistics, France was clearly grappling with a problem that was about more than just bad driving. Maybe, it suggested, driving represented a subconscious desire by the French to escape from their nannying, ever-present state, to thumb their noses at the forces of law and order. In protestant northern Europe, it suggested, people tended to have a much better developed sense of collective responsibility. </p> <p>Jean-Pascal Assailly, a psychologist who specialises in driver behaviour, says the French tolerate dangerous driving because \"it's a kind of agreed escape valve for violence. In America, everyone has a gun. In France, we speed. We love speeding. Speeding is a positive value in French society, like confidence, competitiveness and a stylish disregard for danger. The car satisfies that\". </p> <p>Sadly, for some 8,500 people a year, that \"stylish disregard for danger\" means the end of their lives. And until there is the will to change French attitudes, through effective anti-drink driving campaigns, better traffic policing, road safety education from primary school up, and maybe (why not?) a ban on overnight coach journeys, accidents like yesterday's will continue to happen.</p>",
  "<p>Sites contaminated with radioactivity have been sold by the Ministry of Defence and used for housing, factories and recreational use without the new owners being told, the government's nuclear watchdog says in a report out today . </p> <p>The MoD's \"bash, burn and bury\" policy of disposing of surplus stores and equipment meant that many of the 3,000 military sites were contaminated with radioactivity and other substances. The problem was made worse by the MoD's habit of destroying records of what sites contained, says the government's radioactive waste mangement advisory committee. </p> <p>The report was ordered by the government because the MoD is selling off many of its land holdings spread over 600,000 acres. The MoD says hundreds of sites might be contaminated with toxic substances but the RWMAC estimates that \"tens of sites\" are contaminated with radioactivity. </p> <p>The committee says that most of the contamination came from radium-226, a substance commonly used for luminous dials and other components, but there was also tritium and promethium-147 - all three of which are cancer-producing agents. </p> <p>The report says: \"It is not clear how many sites that were once part of the MoD estate have been returned to civilian occupation or the extent to which these may have been contaminated with radioactivity.\" </p> <p>The policy of destroying records had not helped with the inquiry but tests demonstrated significant radioactive contamination of MoD land in regular use by members of the public. The committee also feared that some radium may get into ground water used for public consumption and advised the MoD to check. </p> <p>The problem arose partly because in times of war standards fell below those of peacetime. As a result MoD sites could be littered with hazardous substances, including munitions, solvents, hydrocarbons, heavy metals and asbestos, as well as radioactive materials. </p> <p>\"Bash, burn and bury practices inevitably fell short of what would be considered acceptable today,\" the report says.The report makes clear that not all these problems were caused by the war. </p> <p>The MoD continued to use radium luminising until the 1960s. The committee also discovered that some sites had been so badly surveyed before sale that they had failed to detect radioactivity which subsequent investigation had revealed. </p> <p>The issue had not been given sufficient funding to compile proper reports, the inquiry revealed. </p> <p>The report suggests that the MoD should compile a list of those sites already disposed of and assess the possibility of contamination and investigate. No one at the MoD doubted that such contaminated sites existed, the report says. </p> <p>The report recommends better compiling and keeping of records both for contamination and remediation carried out. </p> <p>The chairman, Charles Curtis, said: \"Our view is that the current planning system alone cannot ensure that land to be redeveloped for new uses will be properly cleaned up. </p> <p>\"The planning system simply was not designed for this purpose.\"</p>",
  "Al Gore took a leaf out of George W Bush's book yesterday, opting for gravitas rather than glamour in his choice of vice-presidential running mate for the Democrats. <p>For all the occasional talk of putting a woman or a black candidate on the presidential ticket one day, both have in the end following the way of all but one of their predecessors: picking an ageing white male to reassure the voters. </p> <p>By choosing Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Mr Gore gives the line-up an apparent symmetry of age and appeal. In both cases the younger man heads the ticket for the November 7 election. </p> <p>Although the age difference between the candidates and their running mates is narrow, the cultural gap on each ticket is much wider. </p> <p>Mr Gore, 52, and Mr Bush, 54, are self-evidently part of the same rock'n'roll generation as 53-year-old President Bill Clinton. But Mr Lieberman, 58, and the Republican vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney, 59, could almost pass for their parents, and are unmistakably the products of the Eisenhower rather than the Kennedy years. </p> <p>The similarity ends there, however, since Mr Lieberman has much less experience of Washington and public life than Mr Gore, whereas Mr Cheney has been chosen in part to compensate for Mr Bush's glaringly short political track record. </p> <p>The two men's political histories are very different, too. Mr Cheney was a youthful Republican high-flyer, recruited to work in the Nixon White House while still in his 20s, becoming Gerald Ford's White House chief of staff at 34, and defence secretary under President Bush after 10 years as a Wyoming congressman. He remains a quintessential Washington insider. </p> <p>Mr Leiberman, on the other hand, has built his political career entirely in his home state, Connecticut. Born in Stamford, where his father owned an off-licence, he went to Yale (as did Mr Cheney, who dropped out), served in the state senate in 1970-80, ran unsuccessfully for Congress, and served two terms as Connecticut attorney general before winning a US Senate seat in 1988. </p> <p>At first sight both seem to have been picked for essentially defensive reasons. Mr Cheney brings White House experience to Mr Bush, Mr Lieberman brings integrity to the Democratic ticket. His moral stature helps Mr Gore to shake off the shadow of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair, to say nothing of the persistent allegations of campaign fundraising improprieties in 1996. </p> <p>Mr Lieberman was one of seven Democrats Mr Gore's spin-doctors said last week were under consideration. In reality, at least three of the short-list - Bill Bradley, Dick Gephardt and Jeanne Shaheen - were only there to make Mr Gore look broad-minded. The real choice came down to three senators: John Edwards of North Carolina, John Kerry of Massachusetts, and Mr Lieberman. </p> <p>All three have centrist political instincts, like Mr Gore, and each came with a characteristic whose political impact Mr Gore had to weigh carefully in making his choice: Mr Edwards is inexperienced, Mr Kerry is married to a Heinz foods heiress, and Mr Lieberman is now be the first Jew on a White House ticket. </p> <p>A further crucial contrast between was immediately apparent yesterday. While Mr Cheney spent his final hours before joining the Bush campaign arranging his tax affairs at the giant oil multinational Halliburton Corporation in Dallas, Mr Lieberman went ahead with a speaking engagement at a trade union conference in Hartford. </p> <p>\"I can't think of a place I'd rather be this morning at this momentous time in my life than with you, the working people of the state of Connecticut,\" he told them. Such words would be improbable, to say the least, coming from Mr Cheney. </p> <p>The two will spend most of the next three months going their separate ways. Mr Cheney is likely to spend much of the campaign in the south and west, where he will exploit his conservative record and views to mobilise the Republican voter base. Mr Bush, meanwhile, will take his greater appeal to moderates and independents to the swing states of the midwest. </p> <p>Mr Lieberman's role is likely to be less sectional. As a moderate he is certain to play a big role in the midwest himself. </p> <p>They will come face to face just once during the campaign, in a vice-presidential debate which will be televised from Danville, Kentucky, on October 5. </p> <p> <b>Vote getters</b></p> <p><b> \u0095Joseph Lieberman</b>: Senator 1988-present </p> <p><b> For</b> <br> Tax cuts for small businesses <br> Gulf war use of force resolution <br> Sale of F-15s to Saudi Arabia <br Welfare-to-work reform <BR> School vouchers experiment </p> <p><b> Against</b> <br> Ban on 'partial birth' abortion <br> Humanitarian aid to Cuba <br> Ban on flag-burning <br> Oil drilling in Alaskan wildlife reserves <br> Cutting aid to Vietnam <br> Cutbacks in national missile defence </p> <p> <b> \u0095Dick Cheney</b>: Congressman 1979-89 </p> <p><b> For</b> <br> Sale of Awacs to Saudi Arabia <br> Raising pensionable retirement age <br> Covert aid to Contras <br> Production of MX missiles <br> Humanitarian aid to contras <br> Cutting federal spending on health, labour and education </p> <p><b> Against</b> <br> Oil profits windfall tax <br> Equal rights amendment <br> South African sanctions and release of Nelson Mandela <br> Notifying workers before plant closures <br> Seven-day waiting period for hand-gun purchases</p>",
  "Al Gore staked his tottering White House dream on the high moral standing of America's first Jewish vice-presidential candidate yesterday, selecting Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut as his running-mate in a move that symbolically underlined the end of the Bill Clinton era. <p>\"Miracles happen,\" a delighted and emotional Mr Lieberman told reporters outside his home in New Haven. Mr Lieberman will be officially unveiled as the number two on the Democratic ticket at an event in Nashville today. </p> <p>Mr Gore's surprise choice finally draws the line between the Clinton years and his own candidacy in his attempt to overcome George W Bush's daunting poll lead. A Gallup poll yesterday showed Mr Bush 17 points ahead of Mr Gore following last week's Republican convention. </p> <p>No Democrat is better qualified to convey that message than Mr Lieberman, who on the Senate floor in September 1998 delivered the most memorable moral denunciation of Mr Clinton's conduct towards Monica Lewinsky of the 15-month impeachment crisis, castigating the president's behaviour as \"inappropriate, immoral and harmful\". </p> <p>The public reprimand was all the more telling because Mr Lieberman and Mr Clinton are old friends from Yale Law School days and political allies on the right of the Democratic Party, who agree on most issues of political substance. Mr Lieberman was the first senator to endorse Mr Clinton's presidential bid in 1992. </p> <p>\"I think he's one of the most outstanding people in public life,\" Mr Clinton said yesterday. \"He's a bold thinker. He's always full of new ideas.\" </p> <p>Mr Gore's choice of running mate is a gamble, more on account of the 58-year-old Connecticut senator's relative national obscurity than because of his religion as an orthodox Jew who refuses to campaign on the Sabbath. </p> <p>Mr Lieberman is from humble origins, the son of a drinkstore owner from Stamford. He has spent his whole career in Connecticut politics, where he was twice attorney-general before winning a US Senate seat in 1988. His wife, Hadassah, whose parents are Holocaust survivors, is also orthodox Jewish. The couple have four children. </p> <p>Before he made his attack on Mr Clinton, Mr Lieberman was most prominently in the public eye for his assaults on television and media depiction of violence and obscenity, in which he joined with the Republican campaigner William Bennett to denounce gangsta rap lyrics and the Jerry Springer Show, among many other targets. </p> <p>There are 11 Jewish senators, but Mr Lieberman is unusual in his observances of kosher dietary laws and Sabbath laws. When the senate meets between sunset on Friday and sunset on Saturday Mr Lieberman takes part, but walks three miles from his home to avoid using motor vehicles. </p> <p>The issue of Mr Lieberman's religion will be attentively watched in the Middle East, but is unlikely to be a major factor in the election, most observers believe, although it is in the nature of these things that few voters openly admit to anti-semitism. A poll in March 1999 suggested that 92% of Americans would vote for a Jew as president. </p> <p>The decision was welcomed as \"a milestone in America's political maturity\" by Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League. \"While anti-semites and those on the fringe of society who subscribe to conspiracy theories may have a field day, we remain confident the American people will dismiss the extremists and consider him on his public record,\" Mr Foxman said. </p> <p>By choosing Mr Lieberman, Mr Gore has opted for a running-mate from the Democratic right who can appeal to the electoral centre-ground which Mr Bush staked out last week in Philadelphia. </p> <p>Mr Lieberman has one of the most independent voting records among all Democratic senators, cooperates regularly with moderate Republicans, and has voted against his party on issues such as national missile defence and school voucher experiments, both of which he supports. </p> <p>Mr Bush had no public comment on his rival's choice yesterday, but his spokesman Ari Fleischer said Mr Lieberman was \"a good man. It's nice that the vice-president has picked someone who agreed with Governor Bush on so many issues.\" </p> <p>Even before getting Mr Gore's call, Mr Lieberman was quickly into on-message political action yesterday, telling a trade union rally in Hartford that he was \"happy to be here at a convention where working people are a priority, not as they were in Philadelphia last week, just props\".</p>",
  "The number of civilians prey to unexploded cluster bombs is significantly higher than admitted by governments, including the British, which have consistently suppressed evidence about the weapon's military effectiveness, according to a devastating report published today. <p>Cluster bombs, which contain at least 147 \"bomblets\" scattered over a large area, were used extensively in the Vietnam, Falklands and Gulf wars, and most recently during Nato's air assault on Kosovo. </p> <p>Cluster bombs have killed 50 people - about one a week - over the past year in the Serbian province, and injured more than 150, says the report by the UK Working Group on Landmines, a charity combining non-government agencies and funded in part by the Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. </p> <p>\"The unexploded bomblets effectively turn into landmines, ready to detonate on contact, causing death and injury to civilians even many years after the war has ended,\" said Richard Lloyd, the group's director. \"As many are brightly coloured and the size of a drinks can, they are particularly attractive to children.\" </p> <p>The report by Rae McGrath, a leading campaigner against landmines, shows the effect of cluster bombs in earlier conflicts is being ignored by confused and indiscriminate military strategies. </p> <p>Cluster bombs were dropped from medium and high altitudes during the Kosovo conflict despite official US assessments after the 1991 Gulf war that they were likely to miss their targets. </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence, which says RAF planes dropped 531 cluster bombs during the Kosovo war, quotes the manufacturer's estimate of a 5% failure rate. But the UN Mine Action Coordinating Centre in Kosovo gives a much higher figure. </p> <p>\"In Kosovo, preliminary statistics for the British RBL755 [a cluster bomb available on the open arms market] show that the failure rate is about 11-12%\", the centre said in March. </p> <p>Moreover, the MoD has itself admitted that the failure rate of cluster bombs used in the Falklands was at least 9.6%, nearly twice as high as the manufacturer's claims. </p> <p>The bomblets are designed to explode on impact but a soft surface or the presence of trees - cluster bombs were dropped against concealed targets in wooded areas of Kosovo - can lead to \"substantial failures\", today's report says. </p> <p>Evidence from the use of cluster bombs in Kosovo, the Gulf war, US military trials, and the Falklands conflict indicate that failure rates range between 9% and 30%, the report says. The difference between a 5% and a 9% failure rate in Kosovo would mean more than 3,000 more unexploded bomblets in the province. </p> <p>Cluster bombs are capable of turning huge areas into killing fields. The report says it is clear from censored figures that their use in Kosovo was disproportionate to any military advantage gained. </p> <p>It says official figures of targets destroyed during the bombing have been discredited by the release of details from the US Munitions Effects Assessment Team (Meat) which conducted a comprehensive investigation immediately after the campaign. </p> <p>The Meat report was suppressed - even the UN could not get a copy - and replaced by one written by the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, General Henry Shelton, based mainly on interviews with aircrews. </p> <p>The Shelton report estimated that 140 tanks, 220 armoured personnel carriers, and 450 artillery pieces were destroyed in Kosovo. Meat's figures are, respectively 14, 18, and 20. The Meat team found that of 744 \"confirmed\" Nato strikes, there was only evidence of 58 successful ones. </p> <p>The 50 people killed by Nato cluster bomblets since the end of the bombing campaign include two British soldiers and a young boy whose death was witnessed by a 13-year-old friend. </p> <p>The friend, who underwent a double leg amputation, recalled: \"I went with my cousins to see the place where Nato bombed. As we walked I saw something yellow - someone told us it was a cluster bomb. One of us took it and put it into a well. Nothing happened... We began talking about taking the bomb to play with and then I just put it somewhere and it exploded. </p> <p>\"The boy near me died and I was thrown a metre into the air. The boy who died was 14 - he had his head cut off.\" </p> <p>In June, in its report on the lessons from Kosovo, the MoD described cluster bombs as \"an effective weapon against area targets such as a group of soft-skinned military vehicles\". It added: \"Nevertheless, we have learned that it would be useful to have a capability to strike single vehicles more accurately...\" </p> <p>Today's report says: \"The continued use of cluster bombs has cost thousands of civilian lives, denied land to the poor and disenfranchised and is now costing the international community millions to eradicate the unexploded submunitions... To continue this distortion of the truth [the official claims of a 5% failure rate] while ignoring the advice of experts from the military and civilian mine-clearance community, is unforgivable.\" </p> <p>Cluster bombs are not covered by legislation banning landmines since they are not \"designed\" to be detonated by people on the ground. Today's report calls for a new international law making governments, the military and manufacturers fully responsible for the clearance of unexploded bomblets and for marking affected land, paying compensation to civilians and handing over to the UN full records of cluster bomb deployment. </p> <p>As a first step, it says, there must be a global moratorium on their use, manufacture and sale, pending an in-depth review of their legality and impact. </p> <p><b>A global threat</b></p> <p><b> Laos</b> <br>More than 25 years after the Vietnam war, 500,000 tonnes of unexploded bombs remain, most of them cluster weapons.</p> <p><b> Falklands</b> <br>More than 100 British cluster bombs were dropped; more than 1,400 unexploded bomblets were cleared after the conflict.</p> <p><b> Kuwait</b> <br>More than 1,400 Kuwaitis were killed in incidents involving unexploded bombs and landmines after the Gulf war.

  "Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef has a penchant for antagonising secular Israelis - over the years he has cursed the supreme court, cabinet ministers, kibbutz dwellers, doctors and Israeli Arabs. Yet his view of the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is far more liberal than that of other religious leaders. <p>The followers of Rabbi Ovadiah's Shas party, overwhelmingly members of an Israeli underclass made up of Middle Eastern and north African Jews, take a hardline view of negotiations with the Palestinians. But the Baghdad-born rabbi has argued since the early 70s that religious law supports territorial concessions - if they save Jewish lives. That stance, together with the 400,000 voters who see the rabbi as a divine figure - and the network of religious schools it has fostered - has transformed Shas into a powerhouse. </p> <p>It is the third largest party in the Israeli knesset (parliament) and its departure from the ruling coalition last month robbed the Labour-led government of its majority in parliament. </p> <p>By fusing ethnic pride with ultra-orthodoxy and a relatively mild approach to the quest for peace, Shas has in theory been a willing coalition partner for rightwing and leftwing governments since the 1980s. </p> <p>The party proved its muscle yet again last week when it got a relative nonentity elected president instead of Nobel prize winner Shimon Peres. After the rabbi's remarks on the Holocaust and Arabs, liberal commentators yesterday urged the prime minister to stop wooing Shas back. </p> <p>\"Any pursuit by Ehud Barak of the blasphemous rabbi, from this moment on, will be considered un conscionable kowtowing, the disappearance of any trace of self respect, grovelling,\" a leader in the Tel Aviv daily Ma'ariv said. </p> <p>But Mr Barak will continue to grovel. His emissaries were hard at work yesterday courting the rabbi's acolytes. </p> <p>\"Shas represents a political reality that can not be ignored. To have any real power to make decisions regarding the peace process, the coalition needs Shas,\" said a commentary in Ha'aretz newspaper, which criticised Mr Barak for failing to hold regular meetings with the rabbi.</p>",
  "<p> When you have to juggle 750,000 outpatient appointments a year, it is best not to be proud, and Britain's biggest hospital trust is not angry about being \"named and shamed\". </p> <p>The staff in Leeds know about the government's need to sound proactive and no one expected the Health Department to reveal that it was the trust itself which last week asked for the hit squad, or modernisation agency, to send in a team. The problems in the city's two world-class hospitals, which have seen a 4% rise in outpatients - 1,700 new clients in the first three months of this year - were flagged up even earlier. The Leeds Teaching Hospitals trust, which had 1,000 patients on 10-hour trolley waits in the spring, warned last month that it was struggling to cope. </p> <p>\"We will welcome and work with the patient access team,\" said David Johnson, the chief executive. </p> <p>Leeds has a renowned expert in second-time-round hip replacements, for instance; a complicated operation lasting an average seven hours compared with the two it takes to give someone their first artificial hip joint. The waiting list for an operation scarcely available 10 years ago reached a nightmare 50 weeks this summer. </p> <p>Leeds also hopes that the access team will reinforce efforts to avoid long term outpatient re-bookings, when a consultant offers to see someone for a check-up in six months' time. The practice is bedevilled by rearrangements. </p> <p>Mr Johnson also blamed the practice, in part, for \"unacceptable\" cases such as that of Louise Orbell, a 25-year-old Leeds customer services adviser who suffered two miscarriages. She had five appointments cancelled in as many months. </p> <p>\"We are partly the victims of our own success, but we would be the last to say we have got everything right,\" said Mr Johnson.</p>",
  "For the Jewish community, Al Gore's choice of Joseph Lieberman is \"the equivalent of getting a man on the moon\" according to Rabbi Marvin Hier, the director and founder of the Museum of Tolerance and the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles. <p>It may be more than two centuries since Francis Salvador was voted on to the provincial congress in South Carolina in 1775 and thus became the first elected Jewish official in what is now the United States, but until very recently anti-semitism has been seen as a factor to be weighed by Jewish politicians seeking office. </p> <p>Now, said Rabbi Hier, that may be finally changing for ever. \"This is really untested on a national basis, but I think Al Gore has made an ingenious move,\" he said. </p> <p>Rabbi Hier predicted real pride in the Jewish community at Mr Gore's choice and that Mr Lieberman's moral position on President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky would outweigh any lingering anti-semitism which he felt remained only in \"a small lunatic fringe\". </p> <p>He added: \"For years, Jews have voted for Christian politicians so I don't think there is any reason why Christians should not vote for Jews.\" </p> <p>A Gallup poll indicated last year that anti-semitism had decreased enormously in the last 50 years. In 1947, only 42% of the population said they would vote for a Jewish politician while the figure for 1999 was 92%. This reflects the great change in the US from a period when anyone who was not a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant was regarded as a political risk. </p> <p>John F Kennedy had to tackle the anti-Catholic prejudices of voters when he was elected in 1960. Demographic changes since then and the increase of the Latino vote now mean that Catholicism is probably an electoral boon. </p> <p>Although there are larger Jewish populations in both New York and Los Angeles than in Tel Aviv and the large numbers of established Jewish politicians in both areas reflect this, the Jewish communities in America's south and midwest are much smaller. Several states already have Jewish senators and there are strong Jewish populations in Florida, New Jersey and Ohio. </p> <p>Ed Rendell, the chairman of the Democratic party, who is also Jewish, told reporters at the weekend, before Mr Gore's decision: \"I don't think that anyone can calculate the effect of having a Jew on the ticket.\" </p> <p>He has since been criticised by Nathan Diament of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America who suggested that the remark might give legitimacy to anti-semitic views. </p> <p>While public attitudes to ethnic background and religion may have softened in the US, few politicians would dare declare themselves as atheist and it seems hard to imagine any Muslim achieving high national elected office given the levels of public prejudice still expressed against them. </p> <p>Locally, a specific ethnic background or religion can be a plus, depending on the makeup of the electorate. It did not harm Jerry Brown, twice elected as governor of California and now mayor of Oakland, that he was an active Buddhist. </p> <p>By chance, a Week Against Hate is launched this week in LA to mark the first anniversary of the shootings carried out by a white supremacist at the North Valley Jewish Centre that led to the death of a postal worker, Joseph Alieto, and the woundings of three Jewish children at the centre.</p>",
  "Sir Robin Day, who has died aged 76, was the most outstanding television journalist of his generation. He transformed the television interview, changed the relationship between politicians and television, and strove to assert balance and rationality into the medium's treatment of current affairs. <p>Day was the youngest of four children. His father, a Lloyd George Liberal, was on the administrative staff of the Post Office. Robin was educated at Bembridge school, had an uneventful war in the Royal Artillery, became a captain, and went on to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1947 at the age of 24, to read law. He made his mark as a memorable president of the Oxford Union. </p> <p>After two years at the bar, he decided that the prospect of success was too distant. He spent one year with the British Information Services in the United States, was briefly employed, on a temporary basis, by BBC Radio and, in 1955, joined Independent Television News, at its launch, as one of its new breed of newscasters. </p> <p>ITN made him. It gave him, by his own account, his happiest four years in television - though he was not an instant success. It was originally felt that he was too unsympathetic and harsh in manner, but this view changed as he developed an entirely new style of interviewing. </p> <p>In the pre-Day era, television interviews were almost always respectful, generally dull and stiff, often insipid. Day asked the direct question pointed like a dagger at the jugular. The turning point in his career was an interview with Sir Kenneth Clark, then chairman of Independent Television, at a time when proposals were mooted to cut ITN's airtime and money. Day asked him questions about the station's future which dumbfounded colleagues and critics by their directness. It was unprecedented that the person in ultimate charge should be questioned about his responsibilities by one of his own employees - and the impact was dramatic. </p> <p>There followed a number of historic interviews which established Day's reputation: with Egypt's President Nasser after the 1956 Suez crisis, when Day sought to pin him down on whether he accepted the existence of the state of Israel; with ex-President Truman - \"Mr President, do you regret having authorised the dropping of the atomic bomb?\"; and, notably, with Prime Minister Harold Macmillan in 1958, in what the Daily Express called \"the most vigorous cross-examination a prime minister has been subjected to in public\". </p> <p>This interview turned Macmillan into a television personality, and was probably the first time that television became a serious part of the political process. Day also made parliament come alive with his unscripted reports of the heated debates during the Suez debacle. </p> <p>In 1959, Day moved to the BBC and Panorama, then the most prestigious current affairs programme. The corporation never really made the best use of his talents, except at elections and, eventually, on Question Time, between 1979 and 1989. The fashion turned against \"talking heads\" and \"government by debate\", with which he, above all others, was identified. He was gradually sidelined, as a chairman figure who simply opened and closed programmes. He described his pre-Question Time period as \"10 years in the wilderness\". There was even a spell of nearly two years when he did not appear at all. </p> <p>In the early-1970s, Day became more deeply involved in radio, where he proved an innovator with It's Your Line, from 1970 to 1976. This was a national phone-in programme that enabled ordinary people, for the first time, to put questions directly to the prime minister and other politicians (it later spawned Election Call). </p> <p>He also presented The World At One, from 1979 to 1987, but never felt that radio was his metier. He was not at his best reading from a script, and it is significant that, in his memoirs, he dismisses his eight-year contribution to the programme with a single sentence. </p> <p>General elections, however, were the time when all the grand inquisitor's talents as cross-examiner came on full display, when the televsion public saw \"the scowling, frowning, glowering\" Robin Day \"with those cruel glasses\" (Frankie Howerd's description), as well as the relieving shafts of humour. </p> <p>His most satisfying role in television came with Question Time. At last, he was given his own show, with an audience - which he had long asked for - albeit late at night, as a temporary, six- month \"filler\" and mainly as a way of giving him something to do. Its success in becoming, under his chairmanship, the most popular and effective current affairs programme on television reveals a great deal about his talents. </p> <p>Why did Robin Day become a national institution, one of the most immediately recognised people in the land, outshining in reputation and respect other television stars whose shows commanded far larger audience figures, and, as he much resented, far higher salaries? </p> <p>It was because he had a unique combination of qualities. He was a very big personality in the true sense, with immense authority. He was extraordinarily witty. A collection of good Day jokes would fill a minor anthology. Question Time also brought out his charm and showmanship. He was inordinately proud of his music-hall gifts, and would insist on showing visitors to his flat videos of his appearances on the Morecambe And Wise Christmas shows and (especially) his Flanagan and Allen rendering of Underneath The Arches on the Des O'Connor show, in which he outstarred and outsang O'Connor. But, above all, he was one of the most well-informed, widely read and serious political figures in public life. </p> <p>Day imbibed politics almost with his mother's milk. His father brought him up to revere parliament and great parliamentarians. As a nine-year-old, he was taken to hear Churchill speak, in the rain. Respect for parliament and the traditional institutions of British life, such as the monarchy and the legal profession, was at the heart of his philosophy all his life. </p> <p>It might be said that his interests were somewhat conventional and narrow. He was almost fixated by parliament, and seemed to think that if someone had made a great parliamentary speech, they had won a great battle, when, in fact, it was events outside parliament that were transforming British politics. His world was one of party politics and current events, rather than long-term trends. He was not particularly interested in industrial affairs or economics, or developments in European countries. </p> <p>Gradually, his private views became more and more conservative, at times rather narrowly nationalist, although he did not allow his personal prejudices to show in public or influence his professional performances. But, within the boundaries of his particular interests, he applied his formidable powers of argument and his extensive knowledge to devastating effect, in private as well as public. </p> <p>He believed passionately in \"government by debate\" and in the need for television to balance pictures of current events with reasoned analysis. Otherwise, the powerful visual impact of television would distort and trivialise. He was equally dedicated to the principle that the interviewer had a duty to be well-informed. </p> <p>Many observers commented on his careful preparation; few realised just how assiduous he was. He would read every current biography and autobiography, and nearly every government white paper. Without research assistants to supply him with background briefings, he would generally be better informed than the many cabinet ministers he interviewed. No wonder prime ministers treated him as their equal, and lesser mortals on the political scene regarded him with awe. </p> <p>Day's contribution to British public life was not confined to the media. For 25 years he campaigned tirelessly, and eventually successfully, for the televising of parliament - not in the interests of television, but of parliament itself. He claimed that he was the first to present the detailed arguments in favour, in a Hansard Society paper in 1963. </p> <p>He also played a major part in the establishment of the national lottery. When the Rothschild Commission on Gambling was set up in 1979, he wrote a letter arguing in detail for the kind of lottery we have today. Lord Rothschild wrote back questioning his arguments. Day replied refuting all criticisms; his arguments prevailed and the eventual report recommended the scheme Day had originally proposed. He followed up with endless letters to successive ministers with relevant responsibilities. </p> <p>In his private life, Day had two personalities. To those who did not know him, he could, at times, appear aggressive and insensitive, seemingly interested only in those who were important because of their fame, public success or wealth. He sometimes found it difficult to talk naturally to intelligent women. He might, to some, have seemed the quintessential member of the all-male Garrick club, one of his favourite haunts. </p> <p>To those who knew him well, however, he was the most stimulating, amusing, convivial and warmest of companions. He was one of those rare people who was genuinely loved by his friends. He was prepared to take infinite pains on their behalf. He was also surprisingly modest; despite his obvious success in public life, he frequently talked of his career as a relative failure, because he had not achieved anything solid. </p> <p>He regretted that he had never entered parliament - although he ran as a Liberal at Hereford in 1959 - and contributed to the real world of politics, instead of playing a secondary role through television. He thrived on his public fame and was proud to be the first television star to be knighted, but privately seemed to feel that his achievements did not compare with those of others who had made their mark in the more traditional professions, especially the law, or by writing learned books. </p> <p>In 1965, he married Katherine Ainslie, an Australian law don at St Anne's College, Oxford, and had two sons. The marriage was dissolved in 1986. One of the tragedies of his life was that his elder son never fully recovered from the effects of multiple skull fractures he sustained in a childhood fall. </p> <p>Some years ago, Day had a coronary bypass, and he suffered from breathing problems that were often evident when he was on the air. He had always fought against a tendency to put on weight. As an undergraduate, he weighed 17 stone, and claimed that, in the course of his life, he had succeeded in losing more weight than any other person. </p> <p>He is survived by his two sons. </p> <p> Robin Day, broadcaster and journalist, born October 24 1923; died August 6 2000</p>",

  "It was to be a week of adventure for the 40 schoolchildren from Edinburgh and Essex, one they had saved for and and planned for almost a year. <p>Yesterday their coach trip to the Dordogne ended before it began, in a ditch by the side of a French motorway, with one of their number dead, four seriously injured, another seven hurt - and the rest trying to come to terms with a swift and awful calamity. </p> <p>Twenty-one of the children were with the 41st Edinburgh Boys' Brigade troop from Duddingston, a suburb of Edinburgh. The dead boy, Craig Norsworthy, 15, was among them. </p> <p>They and six adults had boarded the coach on Sunday night, after which another 17 children and two teachers had joined it in Romford, bound for an activity centre at Brive-la-Gaillarde for canoeing, rock climbing and rafting. </p> <p>People in Duddingston spoke yesterday of the horror as news of the crash came through. The Rev William Brown of Duddingston church, where the troop was based, said: \"We are a very close body. We just love these boys. I'm sorry, I'm finding it very difficult to speak in a composed manner. It is a dreadful tragedy.\" </p> <p>The dead boy's parents, Stephen and Ida Norsworthy, who also have a 16-year-old son Ross, described their \"happy-go-lucky\" lad. \"He was a cheeky wee laddie in the best sense of the word. He liked computers but he had reached the age where he was moving away from them to enjoy the social life.\" </p> <p>Robert Douglas, whose son, Graham, escaped injury, said the boys would be devastated. \"They were a close knit community, and met every Friday. They are a bunch of good guys.\" </p> <p>The coach had been chartered by PGL, a Herefordshire-based children's activity holiday company, and was supplied by Rennies, a family firm from Dunfermline in Fife that has been in the business for 50 years and runs a number of European coach tours. </p> <p>The Volvo, registered in 1995, had seatbelts as required by law, but the company policy is not to insist passengers wear them. Rennies said that each of the two drivers would have been doing three to four-hour stints, and that all its drivers were trained. </p> <p>The general manager, Gordon Menzies, said the firm was devastated. \"This is the first time anything like this has ever happened. Our hearts go out to the child's parents.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for PGL said it organised thousands of school trips each year, and fully checked the suitability of transport companies; it considered Rennies one of the top coach companies in the UK. </p> <p>When the bus reached Romford in Essex, it picked up 17 children and two teachers from the Chadwell Heath Foundation school. Having seen his party off the previous day, headteacher Keith Wilkinson spent yesterday detailing casualties and calming parents. Five pupils were injured, including a girl who had surgery to remove glass from her face, and a boy who suffered a spinal injury. </p> <p>After leaving the Dover to Calais ferry, the coach headed south from Paris. At 6.25am local time it came off the A71 motorway and overturned. It was travelling within the speed limit when it left the carriageway without braking, and tipped on to its side, one hour after a change of driver. Gendarmes at the scene said the accident was thought to have been caused by the driver falling asleep at the wheel. </p> <p>Many on board were asleep. Those who were not said yesterday they did not remember any other vehicle near them at the time. There was screaming and crying as boys clambered through shattered windows to get out. Craig Norsworthy was trapped between a seat and a bulkhead at the coach rear. </p> <p>Alan Meikle, acting head of the Edinburgh BB troop, had to break the news that one of their number had died: \"They have grown up a lot in the last three hours.\" </p> <p>He said that, driving through the night, the drivers took turns at the wheel \"every two or two and a half hours\". Mr Menzies said. \"I am told the French police are saying one of the drivers was asleep, but we can only assume that he was the one in the crew seat and not the driver.

  "We did not agree with the News of the World's naming and shaming campaign, but we do agree with the paper's view, expressed by its columnist Vivienne Parry (Home Office dismisses 'Sarah's law' call to name abusers, August 7) that organisations providing services to children, young people and their families should have free access to information concerning the previous sex offences of their prospective employees. <p>We and others have worked with the government to ensure that the new Criminal Records Bureau will be effective. We campaigned against charges being levied on volunteers or their employing organisations for the checks of criminal records. The bureau is predicting a charge of \u00a310 for the necessary check on someone who is applying for a position that involves substantial unsupervised access to children and young people. </p> <p>We failed to convince government that the charge for checks place an intolerable burden on youth organisations. Youth organisations have enough difficulty in attracting suitable volunteers as it is. A charge of \u00a310 or more for the privilege of giving up spare time will deter many from applying. </p> <p>Now that the naming and shaming campaign is over it is time to continue the dialogue.

This prompts the suspicion that its new campaign for \"Sarah's law\" is a rather desperate attempt to save face - which, since it would amount to manipulating the Payne family's anguish for the paper's self interest, would be more despicable than the original campaign. </p> <p>If the paper wishes to avoid such charges, it should abandon its campaign against paedophiles, which is sensationalist and wholly disproportionate.

  "<p><strong> Wild At Heart</strong> </p> <p>(David Lynch, 1990) </p> <p>10pm, FilmFour </p> <p>The horrible opening in which Nicolas Cage's petty crook Sailor Ripley smashes in the skull of a would-be killer sets the bizarre, dark tone of Lynch's sub-Blue Velvet tale. Cage and Laura Dern's Lula are lovers on the run through a weird American south, stalked by a hitman hired by mother-in-law-from-hell Marietta (Diane Ladd). A road movie with a vengeance, it's full of Lynch's demonic humour, energy and disturbed violence, and won the Palme d'Or at Cannes.

He in turn calls on Dustin Hoffman's Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (\"Nobody knows what producers do. Don't get me started\") to fake a little war against Albania, distracting public and media attention till polling day. It's a little too shambolic for top-notch satire: like those smart bombs, it hits everything in its path indiscriminately. But it's performed with vaudevillian glee and, co-scripted by David Mamet, is very funny. </p> <p><strong> Perdita Durango</strong> </p> <p>(Alex de la Iglesia, 1997) </p> <p>12.10am, FilmFour </p> <p>The further adventures of Perdita, who first appeared in Wild At Heart, played by Isabella Rossellini.

  "<p><strong> Rhymes with \"get a new tailor\"...</strong> yes, it's a gruff, manly hello to the man who levitated the Pentagon and sparred with champions, founded the Village Voice and wrote some of the greatest non-fiction of the last century, and some of its ropiest novels. (In the spirit of charity, let's leave the films out of this.) He's ageless, he's in the mood for trouble and he'll probably still punch the man who says he's not. After 52 years of unmatched notoriety, Norman Mailer stomps into Edinburgh on Monday for the International Book Festival. Still unmissable. </p> <p><strong> Boss hog...</strong> and talking of stomping, there can be no greater expert on the subject than Sonny Barger. As anyone who has read Hunter S Thompson's Hell's Angels knows, they weren't pretending to be dangerous: they were dangerous. Barger, big boss of the Oakland Angels chapter, flies in on Thursday to plug his own account, rather imaginatively entitled Hell's Angel. He's no spring chicken, of course, but there's still an aura of menace around the old chap, which only slightly dissipates when you discover that his given name was Ralph (doesn't rhyme with \"safe\", we're guessing). So a gentle sigh of relief, then, when Sonny/Ralph leaves on Sunday... </p> <p><strong> Say my name, say my name...</strong> You know how Zowie Bowie took the earliest opportunity to change his name back to something vaguely normal?

Now, although the Passport Control team contends that Frank's whole career was one long crime against pop music, we don't subscribe to that sins of the father jive, so when Moon beams down (Wednesday to Saturday) to hawk her new novel America The Beautiful, we're keeping an open mind.

  "<p>Rock'n'roll deaths are notoriously romanticised, and the more untimely the death the bigger the legend. Trouble is, the locations of these deaths are frequently unromantic in the extreme. Hence every year a gang of rock enthusiasts gather in a godforsaken field near Clear Lake, Iowa, to commemorate \"the day the music died\", when a plane carrying Buddy Holly, Richie Valens and The Big Bopper landed in a crumpled heap a few hours after they'd played at the town's Surf Ballroom. Shrines come no more desolate. </p> <p>If Buddy could have swapped his decidedly non-exotic crash site then he probably wouldn't have changed it for Chippenham in Wiltshire, the final resting place of Eddie Cochran. The man who, more than anyone, including Elvis, seemed the archetypal rocker, died in a car crash during a British tour in 1960. Every year the fans turn up on April 17th, and a service is held, oddly, in the St Mary's school playground. Someone in the town brings along the bloodstained blanket that Eddie's head rested on. Someone else sells T-shirts bearing the legend \"Eddie Cochran Chippenham\" - and who can blame them? After all, what more does anyone know about Chippenham? Britain's greatest rocker, Billy Fury, grew up in Liverpool's Dingle but was buried in Mill Hill cemetery, north London. This was one of the graveyards sold by Westminster council's lovely Lady Porter in the late 80s for one penny to a construction company. Fury fans did their best to keep his grave tidy while much of its surroundings became a mass of weeds. The ombudsman eventually forced the council to buy the cemeteries back - at the going commercial rate - and Bill's tomb is once more tended with due respect. </p> <p>Joe Meek, the production genius who created space-age pop (Telstar, Johnny Remember Me, Tribute To Buddy Holly) in his Holloway Road studio in the early to mid 60s, shot his landlady and then himself on February 3rd, 1967, exactly eight years after Holly's death. The Joe Meek Appreciation Society meet annually at a nearby pub where a sadly dwindling number of Meek acolytes can usually be called on to sing chunks of the great man's work. </p> <p>Said pub for years was The Holloway - now the horribly named Spoofer's Bar - until the pub closed after the landlord was shot dead. </p> <p>When Serge Gainsbourg died, the French showed him the kind of respect usually afforded to a head of state. The bon viveur, who revelled in a lack of decorum and once famously told Whitney Houston \"I want to fuck you\" live on TV, would appreciate his graffiti-covered former residence on rue de Verneuil. One fan has written \"Fuck me Serge\"... possibly not Whitney. </p> <p>Nearer to home, Freddie Mercury's house in Notting Hill and Abbey Road studios are similarly barely visible behind ink and spraypaint. A more subtle tribute, to 60s organ king Graham Bond, was paid by mod club The Mousetrap which set up shop adjacent to Finsbury Park station. Bond's obsession with the black arts convinced him that he was being chased down a platform by demons and he promptly threw himself under a Piccadilly line train. A ten minute bus ride will take you to Parkway in Camden Town where AC/DC's Bon Scott met his maker in 1980. After a night's heavy drinking at the Music Machine - now Camden Palace - Bon went to sleep off his hangover in the back of a car, but never woke up. It was an unfortunate choice of parking space, as Parkway became the centre of all things Britpop and neo-mod in the 90s. If he'd died outside the Wulfren Hall, Wolverhampton or in some other more metal-minded city, there would surely be a statue of Bon rather than a bunch of fidgety short men in ill-fitting suits outside the Spread Eagle. </p> <p>Art Fein's book The LA Musical History Tour is a must for rock shrine fanatics; the dedicated can find the Webb Motel, where soul's founding father Sam Cooke was shot dead in 1964, or the homes of Tim Hardin, Janis Joplin, or The Germs' singer Darby Crash, whose double suicide with his girlfriend went slightly awry when she survived. The house where Marvin Gaye was shot dead by his father now bears a sign saying \"do not disturb occupants\". Also listed is the vacant lot where Bobby \"I Fought The Law\" Fuller was found slumped across the front seat of his car by his mother. Fuller had made the unfortunate mistake of dancing at a Hollywood club with a local mobster's girl. He was taken outside, beaten up and filled with gasoline; the coroner's verdict was suicide. </p> <p>The only way to guarantee a shrine in a plum location is to have it built while you're still alive, and Japanese mods have done Paul Weller proud with a shrine they've created in The Weller's Club in beautiful Kyoto. A photo of Paul smiles down beatifically while candles burn all around. This could be tempting fate: who's to say the self-styled Modfather won't come to a sticky end in a snowy field near Mansfield, Middlesbrough or Merthyr Tydfil? </p> <p>Buddy Holly's Rock Shrine, tonight, 8pm, BBC Choice.</p>",
  "At my local supermarket, they try to lure customers to buy items approaching their sell-by date with red stickers that scream \"two for the price of one!\". This way, the crafty retailers figure, you might just be tempted to buy a couple of mouldy plums or blackened avocados - instead of one good one. <p>New Labour, with an eye on its own sell-by date, has decided to adopt the two-for-one sales pitch and, as of next month, we'll be getting two Blairs for the price of one. At the Labour party conference in Brighton, Cherie will join hubby in the political spotlight to sell new Labour to women. There's a precedent, of course, for the first lady to step into the political fray: during her husband's first term in office, Hillary Rodham Clinton decided to tackle America's health care. It was a flop - but this shouldn't deter the double act on this side of the pond. </p> <p>Tony's done his little number, introducing the lacklustre women's unit, the new childcare credit, the parental leave directive and, of course, that lifeless chorus line, Blair's Babes. But Tony's act only earned some half-hearted applause and a lot of jeering from disillusioned women up and down the country who voted new Labour to change their lot - only to find that life under Tony is no better than it was under John, Maggie et al. </p> <p>So heeeeere's Cherie! Drums roll, the spotlight beams, a hush falls over the audience. But is this middle-aged QC capable of the high kicks and high-octane performance needed to jazz things up on the women's front? Cherie is lucky in that new Labour's present prima donna on female issues, Baroness Jay at the Women's Unit, is not a hard act to follow. Three years on, Margaret's unit has failed to come up with a strategy for daycare facilities, equal pay, equal opportunities, or domestic violence. </p> <p>What it did unveil, in a blaze of publicity, was an anorexia summit, which saw the editors of Vogue and other women's mags munching soggy sandwiches while tut-tutting over photos of skeletal fashion victims; and the \"listening to women\" roadshow, which had the baroness being chauffeured around the land to meet with \"real\" women (God knows what they made of Lady Jay up in Jarrow). </p> <p>Mercifully, Cherie's debut in Brighton may mean Margaret's swan-song is not far off. Although the prime minister's wife is only chairing a debate on \"A Marriage of Convenience: Has new Labour Delivered for Women?\", she is doing so for a fringe event sponsored by the Institute for Public Policy Research, the left-wing think-tank with close links to the government. It's hard not to think that Cherie's presence as chairperson signals tacit acknowledgement by Tony that Jay's record needs defending - and that he needs a new ambassador for women. </p> <p>Who better than his QC spouse to argue his case? Cherie, professional high-flier, wife and mother all rolled into one, shows ordinary women that, yes, it's possible under new Labour to have it all. Despite her terrifying abilities and intimidating success, Cherie is resolutely one of us - modest background, broken home, a difficult teenage son and even a rumpled nightgown. She may enjoy occasional use of a royal jet, but she remains accessible - the kind of woman you could moan to about the boss, nappies, or the price of plums. </p> <p>Jay made a point of announcing she was not a feminist; but Cherie is a sister who's gone on record against the prime minister on the EU directive on parental leave. The fact that she's not a professional politico just adds to her appeal: there would be no spin, no hype, no condescension. </p> <p>In his wife, then, Blair has the perfect means to court those precious women's votes. Indeed, Cherie's political future seems so bright, I wonder whether, once in Brighton, she will stop at protecting Tony's party from the attacks of disgruntled feminists. She might just seize the platform to unfurl political ambitions of her own. Hillary, after all, managed to pick herself up after the health care d\u00e9bcle and is now running for mayor of New York. Does Cherie have a similar game plan - baby Leo notwithstanding? She stands a better chance than Hillary, whose steely self-control, before the cameras and in her marriage, are a turn-off to women voters who smell a fake. Cherie is reassuringly real - exhausted by childbirth, windswept on holiday, and ever so slightly naff whenever she turns that adoring gaze on her husband. </p> <p>Yes, two Blairs are better than one. At Brighton, Cherie could well turn in the kind of crowd-pleasing performance needed to restore women's confidence in new Labour. And then, who can stop her? </p> <p> * The number of individuals going bankrupt has hit a five-year high. Before you get out your handkerchiefs, let me add that it's the dot.com entrepreneurs who are swelling the bankruptcy courts. There, did you feel a touch of schadenfreude reading that? Let's face it, those teenyboppers who clicked their mice and raised their millions in less time than it took most of us to fill in a job application are difficult to mourn. For months, their smiley, Clearasil faces were everywhere, cheering us on to invest in their vision and be part of the \"two comma\" (\u00a31,000,000) crowd.

They simply weren't the kind of millionaire you could grow fond of. None of these kids seemed to boast the satisfying narrative that has inspired generations of would-be Bransons. In vain, you scanned their (very brief) bios in search of the weepy rags-to-riches story that had you rooting for the millionaire even while you envied him his Midas touch. No sign anywhere in their well-fed suburban lives of the hard slog of the self-made entre preneur - years of eating beans on toast and dodging the landlord until - eureka! - that brilliant flash of inspiration. These squillion-earners, just sat in front of a screen, came up with a website, and then sold it to techno-luddites like us. Now that their bubble is burst, Susannah and Trinny may be reduced to selling their melons at some market stall. I won't buy any, though. </p> <p>*Flying to Sydney for the Olympic games this summer will be 300 British athletes - and 500 BBC journalists. Shurely shome mishtake? Nope.

  "Feeling betrayed is like feeling happy: most of us think we know exactly what would make us feel that way. But in reality, the most unexpected events can end up provoking those emotions. And just as winning the lottery might make you happy, but not in the way you imagined, the discovery that the love of your life has been unfaithful doesn't always hurt in the ways you think it will. <p>This point is borne out in Passion Play, a West End production that concerns itself with a middle-aged married man who cheats on his wife when a predatory young woman seduces him. The wife is stoical throughout her ordeal. Not only does she forgive her errant spouse, she remains friends with the other woman. After all, despite having the body of Gisele, how could this twentysomething poppet resist falling for him? And as if being her best friend wasn't enough, they go shopping for sexy lingerie together and discuss her husband's tastes. </p> <p>It is a highly unlikely scenario in a play that was written by Peter Nichols nearly 20 years ago. Critics (male) have raved about its emotional honesty, though in truth it seems reactionary and out of date in its assumptions. Nevertheless, there is a single moment, when both women are trying on wispy pieces of silk, in which the wife suddenly realises that her \"friend\" is continuing the affair. She has survived feelings of sexual rejection and despair caused by her husband's behaviour, yet the pain caused by the younger woman's betrayal of their friendship is the most raw and truthful moment in the entire play. </p> <p>Perhaps the reason why this small scene still has emotional resonance is that the actual mechanics of infidelity no longer have the same power to trigger an emotional response from us. We are becoming desensitised to extracurricular lust, both as a dramatic story line and as a fact of life. These days, adultery has spawned a growth industry. The back pages of magazines used to concern themselves only with lonely hearts; now we have agencies for cheating hearts, or \"bored marrieds\" as they refer to their clients. On the internet you can log on to alibi.co.uk, a service that facilitates infidelity by providing fake phone calls, receipts and other paraphernalia for the feckless - and for those without an appropriate adulterous rendezvous, they provide a handy link to Loving Links, the biggest agency for the already attached. For the suspicious, there is Check-a-Mate, an American detective agency soon to set up shop in Britain. For a fee it will send out an alluring decoy to see if your mate is tempted, and then tape the evidence. </p> <p>In this climate, discovering that your partner has been unfaithful, however devastating that may be, feels oddly familiar. We know how we are supposed to react because we have seen it on Coronation Street and read about it in Now! magazine, so it feels all the more puzzling when our responses to infidelity are more complex than the kneejerk pain of sexual rejection. </p> <p>The truth is that there are many different levels of betrayal. Catherine Texier, a writer who lives in Manhattan, wrote movingly about the end of her 18-year marriage to fellow author Joel Rose in Breakup, published last year. The text is one long angry howl of rejection, unsparing in its detail. And yet, throughout the relentless descriptions of the pain of being supplanted by another woman, it is her melancholic sense of domestic betrayal, of being left to cook supper for their two daughters without him, that emerges most strongly. </p> <p>\"I pulled four hamburgers out of the freezer and laid them on the counter next to three ears of corn . . . and when you came down from your office upstairs - it was around 6.30pm - and saw the four hamburgers, you said, coldly, 'I'm not having dinner here tonight.' I feel a little twinge but not more than that because that's our new unspoken deal. So I say, OK, and put one hamburger back in the freezer. And right after that I feel fine.\" </p> <p>Only I bet she doesn't. I think this kind of mundane detail has the power to wound our hearts most deeply. And I remember only too well being on the receiving end of it. I had arrived home a day early from a trip and, on walking into the kitchen, came face to face with unexpected evidence of romantic betrayal: cake. Two plates, the remnants of two slices, chocolate and raspberry fondant, from a favourite patisserie. Other couples have Our Tune, we had Our Cake, only now it had been served up to woo someone else. Sternly, I told myself that I was over-reacting - anyone can eat cake. But as it happened, my suspicions were correct. Even now, I marvel at the sense of betrayal this elicited: emotional death by chocolate cake. </p> <p>Passion Play suggests that there is a link between age and attitudes towards fidelity. Again real life is more complex. One might imagine attitudes about fidelity to be more relaxed among the young, yet a recent Mori survey about moral beliefs indicated that those aged between 15 and 24 were the most unforgiving group when it came to infidelity, perhaps because theirs is the generation that has the highest number of divorced parents. </p> <p>Meanwhile, another survey, for those who set much store by statistics, suggests that women in their 40s are the least faithful. Woman's Journal polled its readers and discovered that two out of three had been unfaithful to their partners. The postwar generation can have unexpected attitudes too. For these women, particularly those brought up to define themselves through marriage rather than professional life, the issues are equally complex. </p> <p>\"I felt betrayed financially,\" says Anna Rodgers, 60. Her husband had an affair last year. \"OK, so he fell for a younger model and wanted to have a fling. Well, that's life. I could have lived with that. What I couldn't forgive was the fact that he had cashed in an insurance policy and used the money to wine and dine her, while I sat at home worrying about how we were going to manage for money after he retired in a few months. He'd lied about other money, our money, that he'd spent on her too. I felt that if he was capable of stealing from me, my future with him was untenable.\" </p> <p>Rodgers was surprised, though, by the reaction of female friends of the same age group. \"Many of them told me they thought I was mad to throw him out, that I should think about my future. I think there is still this stigma among my generation about divorce. One friend asked me whether I felt I had failed. Failed! Marriage isn't an exam. My one big regret is about money - I wish I'd been more shrewd. I tell my daughter, who is 34, that she should make sure she always has her own money, no matter who she marries.\" </p> <p>When Carol Morgan, a 26-year-old teacher, discovered that her husband of seven years had been seeing a colleague, she experienced an overwhelming sense of having been belittled professionally because of her husband's rejection. </p> <p>\"Of course it's painful to discover that your husband has been having sex with someone else, whoever she may be,\" Morgan says. \"But it wasn't the sex part of the equation that led me to end the marriage. We worked for schools in the same neighbourhood and so our professional worlds were connected. When people at his school began to get wind of the affair, people who I regarded as our mutual friends, he confessed to them about what was going on and begged them not to tell me. Not only that, he told them all sorts of stuff about the problems we'd been having within our marriage - really personal stuff including how I had been on anti-depressants, which I didn't want anyone at work to know. Finally, after several months, someone had the decency to tell me what was going on. I felt incandescent with rage. The affair was bad enough. That he had betrayed my trust to people who had professional power over me was beyond the pale. I felt professionally devalued because of what happened. It was inconceivable that I would continue at the same school so I left not only my marriage but my job too.\" </p> <p>Breakup by Catherine Texier is published by Review, priced \u00a36.99.

  "The Philippines' military chief has let slip that the equivalent of about \u00a33.6m in ransom money has so far been paid to a southern rebel group who kidnapped a group of tourists from a Malaysian diving resort in April. <p>A senior civilian official later accused non-state organisations abroad and at home of making the payments, against Manila's better judgment. </p> <p>General Angelo Reyes disclosed the sum at a cabinet meeting, but President Joseph Estrada cut him off because journalists were there covering the meeting: \"We can talk about that privately, not in this forum,\" Mr Estrada said. </p> <p>The Philippines says it has a no-ransom policy and officials have never publicly confirmed that large amounts have been paid to the Abu Sayyaf group. </p> <p>They seized 21 foreign tourists and workers from the Sipadan resort on April 23.

Now why are we writing about the footballer known as \"Zizou\"? </b> Because he has just been voted the most popular person in France, not least because this titan of the modern football game with the verve of a latter-day Johann Cruyff ... </p> <p> <b> Get on with it </b> ... was instrumental in making French football great again by playing in the team that won the World Cup in 1998 and Euro 2000. </p> <p> <b> Who did he beat in the popularity poll? </b> Catherine Deneuve, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Gerard Depardieu, Johnny Hallyday and an 88-year-old Capuchin abbot. </p> <p> <b> Fading actors, an ageing rock star - and who was that last bloke? </b> Abb\u00e9 Pierre, who won a place in French hearts for his work with the Emmaus charity, which he founded in 1949 to help the homeless. Zizou beat him into second place this year. </p> <p> <b> We don't really care about French popularity polls, do we? </b> In this case, yes, we do. Mainly because Zizou's elevation is another slap in the face for racists who dislike the multicultural nature of France. In a recent survey, 60% of French people felt that there were too many Arabs in the country. \"Ten years ago certain extremists would have seen this as a provocation,\" wrote the Journal du Dimanche this week, of Zidane's triumph in the poll. </p> <p> <b> What is Zidane's background? </b> He was born on a rough council estate in Castellane, north Marseilles, to poor Algerian immigrants. </p> <p> <b> Any chance of him filling the Gallic gap in the Arsenal midfield left by Emmanuel Petit? </b> Not unless they can stump up \u00a320m or so. </p> <p> <b> Do say: </b> \"Zizou for president\" (as French fans chanted in Paris after the World Cup victory). </p> <p> <b> Don't say: </b> \"Zizou for Tranmere.\"</p>",
  "The constitutional reforms proposed by Jonathan Freedland and David Walker for Labour's next manifesto (Labour's vital mission to carry on reforming, August 7) leave several questions unanswered. <p> If Freedland's members of an upper house are elected on party lines, how can they be \"entirely out of the reach of government whips and unswayed by patronage\"? </p> <p>Walker wants to abolish \"fixed\" departments and replace them with task groups \"focused on priority policies\". But who is accountable then? The greater part of government is concerned with the fair and effective administration of a huge mass of prior legislation for which a permanent bureaucracy is essential. </p> <p>The fundamental problem in our government is the overweening dominance of the legislature by the executive, which is getting worse. The answer is to give the House of Commons more powers, capitalising on the independence of the Speaker, and more resources, exploiting the potential independence of the House of Commons Commission. </p> <p> <b>Cllr John Garrett</b><br> Former Commission member<br> Norwich </p> <p>\u0095 The future of the monarchy is somewhat secondary to the more important need to extend democracy in the UK. Freedom of information and genuine executive accountability at national parliamentary and local level are infinitely more important than quarrelling over the Queen Mother's 100th birthday. </p> <p> </p> <p>Of course, the monarchy needs to be reformed. Scrap the archaic and presumptive coronation ceremony, which is an affront to any meaningful interpretation of Christianity. God-sponsored monarchies are an arrogant abuse of religious ideals. Let the monarch be offered the crown by the Speaker of the House of Commons. </p> <p>In return, the monarch would pledge to uphold the life, liberty and welfare of the citizenry. Lord lieutenants would be scrapped and replaced by regionally elected crown representation, and the royal family would consist of mum, dad and the kids only. The royal prerogative would go by default, and the monarchy would then become what it should be - the office of ceremonial titular head of state bereft of constitutional powers. </p> <p>I find such a scenario infinitely preferable to a presidential oligarchy run by captains of industry, media barons and the new financial aristocracy. </p> <p><b> Nigel Wade </b><br> Dalrymple, Ayrshire </p> <p>\u0095 The Guardian's \"unroyal commission\" on Labour's manifesto should also look to replace bestowing honours in the name of the British empire, which has long gone. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Tara Kumar Mukherjee</b><br> President, UK Confederation of Indian Organisations </p>"
