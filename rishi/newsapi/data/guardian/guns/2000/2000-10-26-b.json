  "<p>You can't even sit at home these days without dealing with something \"digital\": a toaster, a camera, a television... It can't be long before the advent of digital pyjamas. In the arts, however, \"digital\" should mean a certain breed of work - modern and, hopefully, creatively exploiting new technology. </p> <p>Sightsonic, York's festival of digital arts, occasionally stretched that definition: Elephant Talk used commonplace technology in quite a conventional way; there was an element of the \"Because we can\" to some of the abstract projections that accompanied the Sonic Arts Network's late-night Diffusion gig. </p> <p>But at its heart Sightsonic had a courageous mix of works, from Viennese record label Mego's sonic battering - laptop DJs surfing the line between noise and music - to short films, drop-in have-a-go sessions and children giving concerts using new technology. </p> <p>Most innovatively, some of the works were responsive to their surroundings. Ambrose Field's Frontier X had an intriguing take on \"background\" music. Set up in the bar of the City Screen, it used sensors similar to those of an alarm system to read the movement and number of people in the room. Behind the scenes, a computer was knitting together sounds from a huge bank of possible sounds or ambiences. It was rarely intrusive, but always present: one minute jungle noises, then those of an airport; the gentle sound of lapping water; a clap of thunder. </p> <p>Over at the City Art Gallery, Chaotic Constructions (by Peter Fluck and Tony Myatt) was also celebrating unpredictability. A rotating wall-mounted sculpture of interconnected lines, curves and coloured shapes (like elements from a Kandinsky painting orbiting each other) is tracked by a video camera, and the movement of certain points is again used to influence music that a computer is creating to its own complex set of rules. A brief glance will yield little satisfaction, but the longer you look and listen the harder it is to walk away. It will never, ever repeat itself. Hopefully this festival will.</p>",
  "During the second world war there used to be a criminal offence of \"spreading alarm and despondency.\" If you went around saying, \"the government's claims that the war is going well are all nonsense, you know; we are losing the battle and suffering grievous losses; it is going to end in defeat\", then someone could report you, and you could end up facing prosecution. Even had you been right. <p>There is a problem here for governments, even democratic ones who declare their intention of levelling with the people. It is easy to spread alarm, easy to fan that alarm into panic. Some of the panic buying during the recent fuel crisis showed that. Or take terrorist threats: pass them all on to the public, and you cause perpetual disruption... But fail to pass on a genuine one, and people will die.</p> <p>The 16-volume report of Lord Phillips's inquiry into BSE and its human equivalent vCJD catches many good people in government trembling before this dilemma. Pass on to the public all the scientific assessments, however hard to comprehend and however dire, and alarm and despondency - they told themselves - might break out all over the country. </p> <p>In this fix, civil servants and ministers - though civil servants here take more of the blame, since ministers in this sense are mere amateurs, dependent on professional advice - tend to say to themselves: the worst may never happen. Why worry people unduly? Let's not be afraid (the next, fatal step in the argument) to look on the bright side. Had they been right, and the worst had not happened, they might have earned our gratitude. They were wrong, and a fearful price has been paid. All that is bad enough. What is perhaps even worse is when decisions are taken at last to deal with the threat on the scale that it deserves, and action is not carried through. Belatedly, a ban was imposed in 1989 on bovine offal entering the food chain. But that ban, Lord Phillips and his colleagues, conclude, was never properly enforced. Down the line, risks were taken by people who also told themselves the worst would not happen. Last night, in his excellent TV history of Britain, Simon Schama took as his subject the Black Death which ravaged the country in the 14th century. We know now why it happened: the screen was full of lurid pictures of death-dealing fleas. At the time, though, all sorts of wild theories floated about: the kind of fog which came to be known as miasma was blamed. </p> <p>Suppose a Black Death struck now... We would surely be far more fortunate. We would have the technology to establish a working hypothesis on the causes with relative speed. But we'd need to proceed from the outset with a sense of urgency which could only come from government playing straight with the scientific analysis, not minimising the threat, and above all dealing openly, rather than lulling the country into a false complacency by keeping the bad news from it - as happened here. </p> <p>Lord Phillips's report cannot at all guarantee that disasters like these will not recur, that scientific advice will not be divided, that politicians will be faced with genuinely cruel choices. But it can help to change the climate. Ministers did not lie about CJD, the report concludes: they simply played down the links between BSE and human involvement. We can at least hope that on any future occasions in any way parallel with what happened here, that lesson will be at the front of official minds right through the system. </p> <p>The new Freedom of Information legislation won't help, by the way: it would not give the public the right of access to any of the information denied it in this case.</p>",
  "Little by little, Ulster's bitterly divided Unionist party is being nudged and cajoled towards a more full-hearted commitment to the Good Friday peace process. <p>Tony Blair is in Belfast today, talking to all the parties involved in the power-sharing peace deal. But one man, first secretary David Trimble, holds the key.</p> <p>On Saturday, the ruling council of his Ulster Unionist party will meet to consider a plea from Trimble's hawkish rival Jeffrey Donaldson for a phased withdrawal from the institutions of devolved government in the province.</p> <p>There has been a flurry of initiatives to help stiffen the resolve of Trimble's supporters. Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson has offered them a symbolic but potent little victory over republican Sinn Fein, by ordering that the union flag be flown over ever public building on important national holidays and commemoration days - including the offices occupied by Sinn Fein ministers.</p> <p>This afternoon, no doubt timed to coincide with the Prime Minister's visit, the Ministry of Defence has announced a life-saving order for new ships to Belfast's ailing Harland and Wolff yard.</p> <p>But the biggest carrot that is being dangled before the unionists is being offered by its sworn enemies in the Provisional IRA.</p> <p>They have agreed to another independent inspection of arms dumps, and have said that they are willing to consider talks in the future on a more permanent disarmament process.</p> <p>Donaldson, predictably, has dismissed the IRA statement as nothing new.</p> <p>Indeed, on the face of it, the Provisionals are only offering to let the independent inspectors have another look at what they have already seen - presumably to make sure it's still there.</p> <p>The second part of the offer is more intriguing, for it holds out the prospect, however distant, of genuine disarmament.</p> <p>The IRA, in its customary convoluted way, says it will talk again with General John de Chastelain - the head of the independent disarmament commission, and surely the least employed man in Ulster - when it is satisfied that such talks would advance the peace process.</p> <p>Decoding that cumbersome formula is not too difficult. The IRA is saying, without pinning itself down in any way, that it expects lots of new concessions from the British government and from the unionists, before it makes its next significant advance towards peace.</p> <p>That means further building work on the cross-border all-Ireland institutions established by the Good Friday accord.</p> <p>Most of all, it means steady progress towards a thorough reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p> <p>This is the most sensitive issue of all for both communities in Northern Ireland. For republicans, the RUC is a hated symbol of oppression; for unionists, it is an equally potent symbol of their links with Britain.</p> <p>It is this issue which, more than any other, threatens to tear Trimble's party asunder. Already, there are clear signals that the right wing is being tugged in the direction of Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists or one of the other smaller factions competing for the 'no surrender' vote.</p> <p>This year, Northern Ireland's first minister has already survived one bruising internal party debate, and a bid for the leadership. Both votes were desperately narrow.</p> <p>With yet another challenge looming, he will be in no mood today to jump at the IRA offer as proof that the peace is holding. Rather, he will be demanding greater proofs from the republican movement that it really intends to keep the peace.</p> <p>And he will be pleading with Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson to tone down or delay their police reform legislation.</p> <p><br><b>Useful links: </b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Northern_Ireland\">Special report: Northern Ireland</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.uup.org\" target=\"_new\">Ulster Unionists</a> <br> <a href=\"http://sinnfein.ie\" target=\"_new\">Sinn Fein</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.indigo.ie/sdlp\" target=\"_new\">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.com/cgi-bin/todaysnews\" target=\"_new\"> Belfast Telegraph</a> <br> <a href=\"http://scripts.ireland.com/tardis.plx?main=newspaper/front\" target=\"_new\">Irish Times</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.irishnews.com\" target=\"_new\">Irish News</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.dup.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Democratic Unionist Party</a> <br> <a href=\"http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Cain (Conflict Archive on the Internet)</a></p>",
  "<p>Andersen Consulting is to plough a massive \u00a3121m into a global rebranding campaign when it changes its name to Accenture next year.</p> <p>The management consultancy has announced that it is changing its name on January 1, when it splits from sister company Arthur Andersen.</p> <p>Since the move was confirmed in August, Andersen Consulting has been searching for a new name in a multimillion pound process that has involved law firms in 49 different countries, a team of linguistics specialists and the international branding consultancy Landor Associates.</p> <p> The new name was devised by an Andersen Consulting employee in Norway and chosen from an initial list comprising a staggering 5,000 names.</p> <p>Jim Murphy, Andersen Consulting's worldwide marketing director, said: \"This is a unique undertaking given the size of the firm. Our name is everything and we wanted the new name to reflect the fact that we do a lot more than just consultancy work.\"</p> <p>The rebranding campaign will begin on January 1 and will run through to August 2001.</p> <p>It will include advertising, PR and direct marketing and will be conducted through the Young &amp; Rubicam group of marketing companies, which includes the direct marketing agency Impiric and the PR agency Burston Marsteller.</p> <p>The firm split from Arthur Andersen because the accountancy firm had set up its own strategic consultancy arm, making it a competitor to Andersen Consulting.</p> <p> Andersen Consulting then went to an independent arbitrator claiming Arthur Andersen's decision to build a consultancy business put it in breach of an agreement between the two firms.</p> <p> The arbitrator ruled that Andersen Consulting should be allowed to split from its sister company, but in so doing it lost the right to its brand name.</p>",
  "Ivan Massow is a man who attracts oxymorons. A gay businessman who started a financial services company which catered especially for gay men and women long before it was fashionable, he subsequently \"came out\" as a Conservative, becoming friends with Michael Portillo and William Hague. A campaigner against homophobia, he was also a vocal supporter of foxhunting. Steven Norris's running mate in the London mayoral elections, in 1999, he was made the chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Last year, he was Baroness Thatcher's official companion at the Tory party conference. This August, he defected to Labour, chastising the Conservatives for their nastiness, specifically their stance on section 28. <p>\"I always thought that economically, the Conservative party had taught the country a great deal. They were inspirational and revolutionary in the way they created monetarism and curbed the power of the unions - all the things Tony Blair now endorses and couldn't live without. But they were lacking a heart or any form of compassionate understanding. Politically, they were being driven by a few nutcases and I hoped to represent what they could become. My belief is in social inclusion.\" </p> <p>Because of this belief, Massow came into conflict with Baroness Young over the repeal of section 28. \"She's a silly old lady who likes the attention. Still, she'll be dead one day and we won't have to worry about her for too much longer.\" </p> <p>He is equally blunt about Baroness Thatcher, describing her as \"completely doolally, a bonkers old bird who says the wrong thing at every possible moment\", after his attempt last year to gain her support for the repeal of section 28 failed, incurring the wrath of the gay community in the process. \"I thought I had enough credibility as someone who had always fought for equality and for gay rights for people to understand that if I was trying to see Margaret Thatcher, I was trying to see her for a reason. </p> <p>\"You only have to be some lip-synching fucking teen pop star to be a gay hero, but if you're gay and you work your whole life to promote equality, write articles for news-papers, campaign to scrap section 28, do whatever you do, it's not good enough. And I think that's because you are gay. Gay people are traditionally the most homophobic I have ever come across. I don't know why the gay press especially hates me. I don't think I am enough of a victim for them. I would like the gay community to be more grown up than it is about these things but at the moment I accept its limitations.\" He pauses and smiles. \"What a patronising bastard I am.\" </p> <p>Despite what he sees as the gay community's lack of gratitude, Massow continues to campaign on gay issues and donate to gay charities. As one of the first businessmen to recognise the potential of the pink pound, Massow has arguably done more than anyone else to make gay mainstream. </p> <p>\"When I started Massow's, it was a crusade because I thought people were being treated unjustly. I thought it would be a way of creating pressure through consolidated economic power. If it caught on, it could change the way gay people were viewed by society. I thought it was really important that businesses saw the gay community as a useful area to exploit, and what maybe is exploitation if the glass is half-empty, is respect, consideration and eventual mainstream acceptance, if the glass is half-full.\" </p> <p>In 10 years, Massow's has not only offered gay men and women empowerment and choices when it came to their finances, it has developed into the 10th biggest brokerage in London. \"The best contemporary businesses come to us not because we will give them gay advice but because we will look at their business in a very metropolitan way and provide them with an employee benefits package which will not differentiate in any way with regard to sexuality, marital status, religion or whatever,\" Massow says in full salesman mode. But working to build his business for the past decade has taken its toll and his latest bright idea is designed to give Massow more free time as well as creating a company capable of competing in a new, more aggressive financial services arena. </p> <p>Merging Massow's with its competitor, Rainbow Finance, Massow has given up 30% of his company to venture capitalists and will become chairman of Massow Rainbow Group Ltd, one of the country's biggest independent financial advisers. </p> <p>\"Losing control is always worrying but what I'm doing is actually gaining control of my life. I'm now 100% in control of my life. I'm free to be bankrupt, I'm free to be rich, I'm free to be whatever. Whatever happens, I'm in charge. Someone said to me, 'I suppose you are going to go on holiday' and I was like 'No way.' This is the first opportunity I have to work again and follow through with my ideas. I'm going to go and do something fantastic.\" </p> <p>\"Something fantastic\" doesn't include a political career. Yet. </p> <p>\"I would like to be in parliament one day,\" he concedes, though he doesn't care whether it's in the Commons or the Lords. \"I haven't applied for the People's Peerages, though that is the way I would like to go in. Having independent scrutineers in the Lords would be such a breath of fresh air. As it is, having the Conservative party use the House of Lords to score crowd-pleasing opposition points and nothing else is a disgrace.\" </p> <p>Since leaving the Conservatives, Massow has become an ardent defender of the government, its economic policy and its record on gay rights. \"They have taken a lot of risks for the gay community. They may not have been successful but they've tried very hard and they are in government. They have wide responsibilities and one of those responsibilities is to be re-elected because we know the Conservative party would never allow any of this to happen.\" </p> <p>He does think it is about time that gay people's contribution to the Treasury's coffers was recognised. \"When the Terrence Higgins Trust gets money, you see letters in the Daily Mail saying 'I don't see why taxpayers' money should be spent on this' as if gay people aren't taxpayers. All the evidence I have seen suggests that gay people are usually slightly higher earners. They are far more likely to pay for private medical treatment, and far less likely to use the education system and other support infrastructures that are created for families. Effectively, they are just taxpayers who may drive a car and use a road. Beyond that, they must fall into the cheapest kind of citizen for the state, yet gay couples are denied the inheritance tax breaks that married couples enjoy after one day of marriage.\" </p> <p>Not that he advocates gay marriages. \"Gay unions are as dangerous as they are useful. Gay people are notoriously fickle in their relationships and split up all the time. In Amsterdam where this happens, there is a proper divorce procedure which means that people do lose half the belongings to their ex.\" </p> <p>As for his own private life, Massow fondly describes his partner Nils as his \"best-kept secret.\" While in the past, he has exposed his personal experiences - including the suicide of his then boyfriend - to the public eye, he refuses to elaborate on his current relationship. \"When my partner died, I thought it would be really good to write about it to help other people. It is an important, painful thing that happens to people - there's no reason not to talk about it. I haven't been afraid to talk about things because I don't see myself as important enough for what I say to matter. Some people think they are so important, they won't speak to anyone. I don't give a fuck.\" </p> <p>That much is obvious.</p>",
  "<p>Do you know how much your quarterly electricity bill is? A third of consumers don't have a clue. \"It's astounding. We spend more than \u00a34bn a year running the lights and appliances in our homes, but many people don't know what it costs them or the savings they can make,\" says Eoin Lees, chief executive of the Energy Savings Trust (EST), which has carried out a survey of consumer attitudes towards energy consumption. </p> <p>The EST discovered that although 79% of people claim to have an \"environmental conscience\", only 8% consider energy efficiency a key factor when buying household appliances. </p> <p>\"Much of the electricity used in the UK's homes is needlessly wasted and the resultant carbon dioxide released may contribute to global warming,\" says Lees. \"Clearly people see the environment as important, but they haven't made the link between switching on an appliance, the energy it uses and the carbon dioxide that it sends into the atmosphere.\" </p> <p>The government wants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% in the next 10 years and is working with the EST to persuade consumers to cut energy consumption. </p> <p>But if you are apathetic about the environmental message, then the savings you can make may encourage you to take action. A few simple steps can save you up to \u00a3250 a year and as the nights draw in, make your home a warmer and cosier place. </p> <p><strong> Household appliances</strong><br> </p> <p> We consume \u00a31.2bn worth of electricity every year just running fridges and freezers. Every time you open the door it takes the appliance three minutes to regain its temperature. One way of saving money is to ensure that your fridge/freezer is regularly defrosted and that food is allowed to cool before storing. Don't put your fridge next to a cooker or boiler, washing machine or dishwasher if you can avoid it, because it will use more energy to keep cool. If your fridge/freezer is more than 10 years old then it is probably worth getting a new one. A new appliance can save you up to \u00a345 a year. All new appliances have to carry an EU energy label which gives details of energy efficiency. Those rated \"A\" are the most energy efficient and as a result are often more expensive than those lower down the scale. </p> <p>As well as the EU energy label, look out for the EST's \"energy efficiency recommended\" label. Products which exceed criteria laid down by the trust and an independent panel of experts will be entitled to carry the label. </p> <p>Washing machines, tumble dryers and dishwashers also use substantial amounts of electricity - again it's worth investing in a new more efficient model if yours is more than 10 years old. For maximum savings always wait until you have a full load before running the appliance and use a lower temperature - a 40C wash cycle uses 30% less electricity than a 60C cycle and many detergents work just as well at lower temperatures. </p> <p>Always switch your TV standby off. Every year TVs use \u00a350m-worth of electricity just waiting to be fully switched on. </p> <p><strong> Lighting</strong><br> </p> <p> Energy efficient lightbulbs, although more expensive than conventional ones, save money in the long run as they use only 25% of the electricity of a normal lightbulb and last up to 10 times longer. If every home in Britain installed just three of them, it would save enough energy to power all the UK's street lights. </p> <p><strong> Heating</strong><br> </p> <p> Replacing an old boiler could save 20% on your fuel bills and if it's a condensing boiler with full heating controls, you could save up to 45%. Condensing boilers are the most efficient because they typically convert around 88% of the fuel into heat compared with 72% for standard boilers. New boilers, like other appliances, carry an EU efficiency rating from A to G. A central heating system with full heating controls could save you up to \u00a385 a year. </p> <p><strong> Insulation</strong><br> </p> <p> Walls lose more heat than any other part of your home. If you live in a home built after the 1930s then it is likely to have cavity walls which can be insulated. It's a straightforward process and can reduce heat loss by up to 60% and save \u00a375 to \u00a3150 on your fuel bills each year. Older houses are likely to need solid wall insulation. This is more expensive and involves insulating and then weatherproofing external walls. </p> <p>You may already have loft insulation but if its not thick enough then you will still lose a lot of heat. Insulation that is at least 20cm thick can save up to 20% on your heating costs. </p> <p>Double glazing is also an option, particularly if you have to replace old windows. Double Low E glazing costs about \u00a3250 more than normal double glazing but it will cut \u00a330 to \u00a340 from your bills each year. </p> <p><strong> New homes</strong><br> </p> <p> If you are considering buying a new home, then some of the hard work will be done for you. From January 1, 2001 house builders with have to provide prospective buyers with information on the energy efficiency levels of all new homes. Construction minister Nick Raynsford says: \"This new requirement will give prospective buyers and first occupiers an idea of how energy efficient the home is and help to promote energy efficiency as a factor in people's decisions on which home to choose.\" </p> <p><strong> Help, advice and grants</strong><br> </p> <p> If you want to ensure that you are saving as much energy as possible, you can get help and advice from a nationwide network of local energy efficiency advice centres. These can also put you in touch with profes sional heating, insulation and glazing installers. It's worth remembering that the VAT charged by these installers is only 5%, rather than the normal 17.5%. For details of your local centre call 0345 2772000. </p> <p>Various grants are on offer from the government, energy suppliers and local authorities. Two million people with oil or liquid petroleum gas heating, for example, are entitled to a grant of between \u00a3175 and \u00a3250 towards the cost of switching to a more efficient condensing boiler. Although grants vary from region to region, the Energy Savings Trust estimates that 51% of homes in Exeter, for example, are eligible for energy efficiency grants and in some areas that increases to more than 70%. </p> <p>For details of grants available contact your local energy efficiency advice centre or check out the EST website - <a href=\"http://www.saveenergy.co.uk.\">www.saveenergy.co.uk.</a> Its database can pinpoint specific grants available in your area, depending on your particular circumstances. </p> <p><strong> Loft insulation</strong> </p> <p> By increasing the depth of loft insulation to at least 8 inches (200mm), you can save \u00a345 on your bills each year </p> <p> <strong> Cavity wall insulation</strong> </p> <p> Installing cavity wall insulation will reduce heat loss through your walls by up to 60% and can save you \u00a375-\u00a3150 from your annual fuel bills </p> <p> <strong> Double glazing</strong> </p> <p> If you are replacing your windows, go for Double Low E glazing. It costs an extra \u00a3275 if fitted by an installer and will save you \u00a330-40 each year </p> <p> <strong> Energy saving lightbulbs</strong> </p> <p> Energy saving lightbulbs only cost about \u00a35 each but save you up to \u00a310 each year </p> <p> <strong> Choice of appliance</strong> </p> <p> Buying an energy efficient recommended appliance - like a new fridge freezer - could save you up to \u00a3450 in running costs over its 10-year lifespan </p> <p> <strong> Heating controls</strong> </p> <p> Adding full heating controls to your central heating system could save up to \u00a385 a year </p> <p> <strong> Maintaining your boiler</strong> </p> <p> Replace unreliable or old boilers and save 30% of your fuel bills. Installing an efficient condensing boiler will save you up to \u00a3120 a year</p>",
  "Lord Phillips's inquiry into BSE has found that the crisis was too complex and too prolonged for it to be the fault of any one individual or decision. However, it did name many players in the drama. Among them are: <p><b>Ministers</b></p> <p>\u0095 <b>John Gummer</b>, agriculture minister, 1989-93<br> More than any other politician John Gummer tied himself in the public mind to the mismanagement of the BSE crisis, thanks to his infamous publicity stunt in May 1990 where he was filmed feeding a beefburger to his four-year-old daughter. Mr Gummer told the inquiry that he had been challenged by a newspaper to demonstrate his confidence in beef in this way. </p> <p>The report said: \"Mr Gummer was faced with choosing between two unattractive alternatives. It may seem with hindsight that, caught in a no-win situation, he chose the wrong option, but it is not a matter for which he ought to be criticised \". He also escaped censure for insisting in May 1990 that beef was safe to eat, because he qualified his statement by saying it was based on an assumption that the ban on high-risk tissue entering the food chain was in place and being enforced. </p> <p>Mr Gummer's pivotal role in BSE was in part caused by the bad luck of being in the central job at the wrong time. His reputation both as agriculture minister and, later, as minister for the environment, was that of a reformer. A pro-European from the compassionate wing of the Conservative party, he was one of the few Tories to take the environmental agenda seriously.</p> <p>\u0095 <b>Douglas Hogg</b>, agriculture minister, 1995-97<br> Douglas Hogg was the public face of the BSE crisis under John Major - a face that often appeared to hide under his wide-brimmed hat and raincoat. Bad at public relations, he was more successful with policy matters, the inquiry says. Widely-expected to be the fall guy in the report, he emerges with his reputation mostly intact.</p> <p>However the report challenges some of Mr Hogg's evidence to the inquiry and criticises him for not acting quickly enough when confronted with evidence of a link between vCJD and contaminated meat. Mr Hogg also told the inquiry that he had come up with the \"30-month scheme\" (a ban on the sale of beef over 30 months old) months before it was announced in March 1996. </p> <p>But the report disputes that, saying the panel was convinced he only came up with the scheme shortly before it was announced. He was also criticised for not involving the Department of Health in discussions about how to deal with the crisis. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Mr Hogg was praised for \"reading the riot act\" to slaughterhouse operators in 1995 after shocking levels of hygiene and enforcement emerged. </p> <p>\u0095 <b>Stephen Dorrell</b>, health secretary, 1995-97<br> Members of the last Conservative government recall Stephen Dorrell's statement to the House of Commons in 1996 admitting that there was a link between BSE and CJD as the pivotal moment of the crisis. As health minister, he became responsible for managing public reaction to an issue over which his department had little control. </p> <p>In the report, he was criticised for insisting beef was safe just months before the link with humans emerged. The report said it was \"regrettable that he gave a public assurance in terms more extreme than he could justify\". His department was also accused of \"inertia\" in not acting when serious evidence of the numbers of young people affected by vCJD emerged in 1996. </p> <p>\u0095 <b>John MacGregor</b>, agriculture minister, 1987-89<br> While he was praised for introducing the ban on high-risk beef offal from being used in human foods, Mr MacGregor was criticised for presenting the ban to the public in a way which downplayed its importance, and for covering up the fact that experts were seriously worried about BSE-infected meat entering the food chain. \"He should not have agreed to a presentation which played down the importance of the ban as a protection for human health,\" the report stated.</p> <p><b>Civil servants</b><br> Among the civil servants criticised for their lack of dynamism in responding to BSE are two leading officials:</p> <p>\u0095 <b>Keith Meldrum</b>, chief veterinary officer, 1988-97<br> The nation's chief vet was a central figure in the crisis, advising ministers on how to react to growing medical evidence that there might be a threat to human health. He is accused of not giving proper consideration to the theory that BSE could \"jump\" species and infect other animals or humans. </p> <p>The report also criticised Mr Meldrum for telling the then-agriculture minister John Gummer that there was no connection between a cat with a BSE-like illness and mad cow disease. </p> <p>\u0095 <b>Sir Donald Acheson</b>, chief medical officer, 1983-91<br> He is accused of giving the public \"false reassurance\" about the safety of beef.

  "Rail chiefs today attended an emergency summit with the Deputy Prime Minister to sort out the chaos which saw another derailment this morning and the prospect of months of misery for fed-up passengers. <p>John Prescott was in talks with leading industry figures to thrash out a strategy for \"getting the situation under control\", a Transport Department spokesman said.</p> <p>Just hours before they met, another derailment put scores more passengers at risk when a commuter train in Surrey skidded on wet leaves and slid into the path of another train, which fortunately managed to stop in time.</p> <p>It came only nine days after the Hatfield disaster, which killed four people and provoked widespread safety restrictions.</p> <p>This morning's incident happened near Virginia Water, Surrey, as the 8.21am South West Trains service from Weybridge to nearby Staines derailed at 8.43am, narrowly missing another train travelling from Reading to Waterloo.</p> <p>Railtrack chiefs last night warned of months of misery ahead as speed restrictions were imposed and engineers worked through the rail network making safety checks.</p> <p>Today's summit at the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, in London, involved Railtrack chief executive, Gerald Corbett, rail regulator Tom Winsor, Alastair Morton, the head of the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority, and representatives from the train companies. A DETR spokesman said: \"They have been called in to give assurances to the government that everything possible is being done to get the situation under control.</p> <p>\"We are seeing passengers' patience stretched. Inconvenience is necessary to get safety right. But it's clear it has not been handled very well over the last couple of days.</p> <p>\"What we're looking for is the industry to agree a timetable to repair faults and for the public to be given maximum information.\"</p> <p>In this morning's derailment, four carriages carrying scores of passengers overshot the platform and were derailed by the points. The commuters emerged shaken but unhurt, with two treated for shock.</p> <p>Railtrack Southern rail director Michael Holden said: \"It's one more crash we could have done without.</p> <p>\"Initial investigations suggest it was caused by autumn conditions - leaves on the line or wetness on top of the rail. Any derailment is a serious incident and we will fully investigate.\"</p> <p>Passenger Martin Groves, 41, vowed never to used the railways again after his ordeal, which comes only nine days after a train hit a bus at a level crossing in Egham.</p> <p>Mr Groves said: \"There was a huge bang and I knew immediately we had come off the track. When the carriage started to turn I thought I wouldn't see my wife and son again.\"</p> <p>Back in London, Mr Prescott's summit was derided by the Conservatives as another \"lecture\". Bernard Jenkin, the shadow transport minister, said: \"John Prescott has been in charge of Britain's railways for three and a half years and it's now a complete shambles.</p> <p>\"He should be asking himself what he's got wrong over that time. The last thing the railway needs is more lectures from politicians about how to run trains on time, least of all from John Prescott.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, railway engineers were working across the network to make checks and repairs. The West Coast line, which was closed between the Scottish border and Glasgow at short notice yesterday for safety checks, was reopened ahead of schedule today.</p> <p>A Railtrack spokesman said that 20 sites with problems had been found by engineers, resulting in nine areas on the route between Glasgow and Gretna having speed restrictions of 20mph imposed.</p> <p>Railtrack boss Gerald Corbett said that other speed restrictions and safety checks across the rail network would mean \"inevitable\" passenger delays over the coming months.</p> <p>The company said instances of \"gauge corner cracking\" - a track fatigue phenomenon thought to have caused the Hatfield crash - appeared to have increased.</p> <p>The short-notice closure of the West Coast line added to the lengthy delays nationwide yesterday.</p> <p>Mr Corbett apologised for the short-notice closure of the line and added that \"in situations like these, mistakes can get made\".</p> <p>Nearly all of the 25 passenger train companies reported delays after the closure, with some passengers needing an extra 75 minutes to complete their journeys.</p> <p>The Royal Mail said millions of letters were being delayed because of the disruption.</p>",
  "Forget opinion polls. The latest way to find out which way the political wind is blowing involves hard cash - and lots of it. In Britain and the United States, betting on politics has become a serious business. <p>The latest case to make headlines cropped up in the Commons this week. Over the summer, those in the know staked \u00a350,000 at bookmakers William Hill on Labour MP Michael Martin being elected to succeed Betty Boothroyd as Speaker of the House of Commons. Mr Martin duly won the job. </p> <p>So who were the prescient punters? According to rumours in the Commons, most of them were MPs who were well-rewarded for their efforts. One Glasgow backbencher is thought to have made \u00a3200,000 on a \u00a310,000 stake. </p> <p>But this is small beer compared with what goes on across the Atlantic. US law bans the kind of bets which have caused a fuss among MPs this week, but in the cradle of capitalism the markets are king and politics, like everything else, is judged in dollar terms. </p> <p>At the head of the pack is a website, the <a href=\"http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/\" target=\"_new\">Iowa electronic market</a>, which has become an exchange for political futures. If you are tired of trading in pork belly futures or next year's coffee prices and think that Al Gore is going to make it into the White House on November 7, his stock is currently trading at 48 cents (34p). In the middle of last month, it reached 50.8 cents (36p). </p> <p>The system is simple. Stockholders are paid after the election, with payments directly related to the share of the national vote their chosen candidate wins. Say Al Gore gains only 35% of the vote. Each unit of stock will pay 35 cents. The trick is, of course, to buy underpriced stock, just as on Wall Street. Stock prices are determined by trading levels. If no one wants to buy, the price falls until they do.</p> <p>Each trader is limited to spending $500 (about \u00a3350) but that has not stopped US political junkies putting several hundred thousand dollars behind their chosen candidates. And they know what they are doing. In the 1996 presidential election, the markets came within two-tenths of Clinton's win of the popular vote (Clinton over Dole, 49.24 to 40.71%).</p> <p>And with Al Gore trading at the moment slightly ahead of his poll rating, we may yet be in for an election surprise. </p> <p>Remarkably, the Iowa site was set up by university academics, keen to interest students in politics, and is run on a not-for-profit-basis.</p> <p>Far more brazen was another US site, Voteauction.com, which allowed electors to put their right to vote up for sale. It was part commercial, part a political comment on the nature of US politics. \"If entire elections can be bought and sold to the individual or corporation with the most money, why can't individual votes?\" asked the site. Sadly, for political betting fans at least, the site was shut down by election officials. Votes, it seems, are officially not for sale - unless it comes to betting on the Commons Speaker.</p>",
  "Senior politicians are expected to be accused of a \"public betrayal\" over their handling of the BSE crisis in a report published today. <p>It accuses civil servants and politicians, including former Tory agriculture minister John Gummer, of failing to heed scientists' warnings over BSE. The report says they did not act quickly enough when evidence started to emerge that humans were being infected. </p> <p>\"This is the core criticism that involves everyone from the cabinet down,\" said one government source. \"It is clear he (inquiry chairman Lord Phillips) regards it as an act of public betrayal.\" </p> <p>Families of some of the 84 victims human form of the disease - vCJD - will gather in a London conference centre this morning hoping to get some answers about why their loved ones died. </p> <p>The 16-volume report follows a \u00a327 million inquiry that has spanned the past two and a half years. </p> <p>It focuses on government failures to enforce abattoir controls which were designed to ensure that any potentially BSE-infected beef was removed from the food chain. </p> <p>The publication came as a consumer group warned that there were still \"uncertainties\" over controls aimed at preventing transmission of the infection to humans. </p> <p>The Consumers' Association (CA) said today that the crisis was still not over and said there were doubts that safety controls were adequate. </p> <p>Sheila McKechnie, director of the CA, said: \"The crisis is by no means over. </p> <p>\"Many questions still remain. What will the real toll be? \"And are there adequate measures in place to deal with them? The disease is in the human population and we need to take steps now to prevent its spread.\"</p> <p>Clinical signs of BSE were first detected in 1985 and the disease was officially recognised in 1986. Almost from the outset there were fears, expressed loudly in the media, of a threat to human health. </p> <p>Despite the government controls, recorded cases of BSE rose through the 1990s, reaching 100,000 in July 1993. Between November 1986 and November 1985, a total of 154,592 cases were confirmed on 32,906 UK farms. </p> <p>On May 21 1995, a 19-year-old called Stephen Churchill died in hospital after suffering a terrible illness that caused him to hallucinate, become mentally confused, and lose control of his movements. He was later diagnosed as the first known victim of a completely new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease that had never been seen before. Two other young people died the same year from what came to be called variant CJD, or vCJD. </p> <p>A year later, scientists confirmed ministers' worst fears, that the most likely cause of vCJD was BSE, also known as \"mad cow disease\". It is thought to have appeared as a result of cattle being given feed containing both the remains of sheep infected with scrapie, and other cattle.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Pilot error</strong><br> </p> <p> The pursuit of wealth is more stressful than poverty, judging by recent surveys. So what a happy thing it is that you can now buy peace of mind with those riches. Indeed, high-street electrical stores are said to make more from marketing this precious commodity than from their sales of merchandise. No sooner have you spied a gadget and succumbed to the salesman's list of its life-enhancing virtues, then he will predict the havoc that it could cause you if you don't spend half as much again on a warranty. But of what value is such a thing, except to said salesman who gets to pocket a commission? Tracey Bowen of London paid \u00a347 for Dixon's Coverplan policy to protect her new Palm Pilot. When a fault developed Coverplan airily told her to contact the manufacturer's helpline since her policy did not cover Palms. This proved useless and 10 calls and 10 days later no one at Coverplan was able to tell her how else to proceed. Eventually, through her own efforts, she got Palm to dispatch a replacement machine from France, but eight letters to Dixons requesting a refund of her policy fee have gone unanswered. </p> <p><strong> \u0095Dixons says that it always arranges for items to be repaired if a fault develops within the first year, but that \"in certain circumstances, depending on our contractual relationship with the supplier or the type of item, we will advise the customer to contact the repair centre direct\". This interesting interpretation of the consumer law is apparently for the sole benefit of the customer who will find the repair process \"speeded up\" if they do all the donkey work themselves. In Bowen's case, Dixons apologises for an \"unacceptable\" delay in processing the repair, but insists that since her Palm was neither stolen nor accidentally damaged it was not covered by her insurance plan. It is, however, prepared at last to refund the price of the policy.</strong> </p> <p><strong> Laptop goes Awol</strong><br> </p> <p> Initially Tom Greatrex, also of London, had better luck with his laptop purchased from PC World, which is part of the Dixons Group. Interestingly, he went straight to the manufacturer who explained that it's the retailer who is supposed to honour its guarantees. The machine was duly collected for repair by Dixons contractor Mastercare, then weeks went by without sight of it. Mastercare insisted that it had been delivered to his office and signed for. A copy of the delivery note was faxed, but, according to Greatrex, the signature did not belong to any of his colleagues and there was no delivery address on the card. \"All Dixons have suggested is that I report the 'theft' to the police,\" says Greatrex, \"but as far as I'm concerned it was never delivered here.\" </p> <p><strong> \u0095Dixons press office has recently developed an energy that its customer services would do well to emulate. Within an hour of Consumer's call, it announces that Greatrex will receive a new laptop. \"We're not quite sure what went wrong,\" says a spokesman.</strong> </p> <p><strong> Left out in the cold</strong><br> </p> <p> P Waite of Twickenham didn't have the chance to test out her warranty, because her fridge/freezer, ordered from another Dixons Group store, Currys, never arrived. She had chosen Currys because it promised next-day delivery and the removal of her old appliance, provided it was defrosted. Mastercare rang to confirm the deliv ery the following afternoon, so Waite defrosted her fridge/freezer. On the day, however, Mastercare rang back to say it didn't have the model in stock. Another date was arranged but no one came. Mastercare blamed Currys and Currys blamed Mastercare but neither could specify a new delivery date. In the meantime Waites reckons she's lost \u00a3150 worth of spoiled food. </p> <p><strong> \u0095Sorry, sorry, sorry, says our friendly Dixons press office. \"Unfortunately, around the time that Ms Waite bought her fridge/freezer the manufacturer discontinued the item and the store was unaware of this.\" At what point they would have become aware of it is anybody's guess because no one updated Waites. Customer services, its arm twisted by the press office, is now offering her an upgraded model for the same price, another model of her choice or a refund plus \u00a3150 compensation.</strong> </p> <p><strong> Virgin's unfair fares</strong><br> </p> <p> Enraged splutterings have greeted Virgin Trains' comments on why it has withdrawn its budget tickets from numerous \"commuter\" trains. \"They say that leisure travellers would crowd out those who need to get to work,\" bellows John Preston of Birmingham. \"How offensive can you get? What about the disabled, those who are ill and cannot work, those who have spent a lifetime working and now have to exist on the pittance of a pension? It's corporate speak for if you cannot pay you are second-class citizens who will be catered for after the fat cats have been fed.\" Peter Hewis, who subsists on a clergy stipend, finds that saver fares he's paid for 28 years have now been withdrawn from the Nuneaton to Euston route. \"My answer is to insist that Richard Branson be made to live on average earnings and use his own trains for travelling off peak.\"</p>",
  "<p>I have to confess to feeling more than a little trepidation at the prospect of interviewing Sheila Kitzinger. She is unequivocally the high priestess of natural childbirth, a household name whose numerous books are hungrily consumed by expectant parents. She has done more to change attitudes to childbirth in the past 40 years than anyone else, conducting a relentless crusade against the medicalisation of childbirth and the detrimental way in which the hands-on experience of midwives has been subjugated to the greater pathological experience of obstetrician. </p> <p>I, meanwhile, earned the unenviable status of Public Enemy Number One in the eyes of the natural birth movement after writing an article earlier this year for this newspaper. In it I dared to put into print criticisms that countless parents feel once the reality of labour and new parenthood fails to match up to the natural birth ideal. I could barely believe the heated passion of some of the responses. Alongside phone calls and letters of support, I got hate mail, while the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) website appeared to talk of little else for months, with some members taking it very personally and demanding that I be sent on an NCT training course to be \"put right\". Now, I prepared to enter the laird of the queen bee herself, complete with birthing stools as coffee tables and batiks of birth symbols lining the walls. Would I emerge alive? </p> <p>Kitzinger shot to prominence in 1962 with the publication of The Experience of Childbirth. The medicalisation of childbirth was at its peak in the late 1950s and Kitzinger's message - that birth was a powerful and exhilarating psychosocial, even sexual event where women needed to retain control - struck a chord with countless parents. There's no doubting her impact: as a result of her efforts, doctors now at least question the need for routine enemas, shaving and episiotomies and accept that the missionary position may not be the best one for giving birth. </p> <p>But the flip side of this revolution has also been damaging. Childbirth is now more politicised than at any point in its history. Women are caught between two polarised stools of high-tech, medicalised birth and natural childbirth. Two surveys published in the past week alone illustrate the opposite ends of the debate. One based on a small sample found that babies born to mothers under the influence of Pethidine were at a slightly higher risk of becoming drug addicts as adults. The other found that mortality and morbidity rates for breech babies were reduced if they were delivered by caesarean section. The first seemed to strike a blow for natural childbirth, the second to push women further into the arms of the doctors. </p> <p>Kitzinger, 71, is a likeable woman - funny, intelligent, warm and keenly alert and youthful. She is also that rare thing in the modern western world, a genuine feminist social revolutionary. \"We are there, marching. You've got to change the system, you've got to change society, you need revolution!\" she exhorts with a large laugh, her fists in the air. \"For me, childbirth, preparation for childbirth and looking back on childbirth as well as making sense of it is to do with feminism, with women reclaiming their bodies.\" Revolutionaries can afford few regrets in case they should be deterred from their cause and Kitzinger admits to few. The drawbacks to her crusade are secondary to the aim of changing the culture in which women give birth. \"It's not pleasant to have anything polarised, it can be nasty and upset relationships, but maybe we need to be uncomfortable, maybe that is how sparks are produced which compel new creative thinking.\" </p> <p>She is a workaholic, a social anthropologist by training who loves nothing more than being out in the field with women in labour to learn from the experience. She struggled as a mother to marry her own career needs and aspirations with those of her five daughters. \"I suppose there's a little bit of me that thinks, if I'd stayed home, prided myself on my apple pie and not argued so much then it might have been easier for some of the girls to have gone and done their own thing. But I don't think you can prepare girls for growing up for the world in which we live today, a world which needs to be changed, by simply seeing yourself in the mother role. I wanted to have warrior children.\" </p> <p>Her passionate enthusiasm stems from her own experience of birth: five exhilarating, \"enjoyable\" labours without complications. \"I remember thinking the first time I had a baby, now this is a sport I can do. In the first stage of labour it's a bit like swimming in very powerful waves, icy-cold water with pebbles being raked up and dashing at your body and bruising you, it's thrilling and you go with the waves.\" (\"You think I'm a sado-masochist, don't you?\" she said subsequently. \"Are you?\" I asked. She didn't reply, just smiled). </p> <p>But the real seeds were sown by her mother, a midwife and active campaigner for birth control, who counselled women in her own sitting room with little Sheila hiding behind the sofa. Her mother clearly had a profound influence on her life. There were tears in her eyes as Kitzinger recalled how she had been with her on the day she died, some 20 years ago. \"Mother was passionately concerned about different aspects of women's lives, but she left school when she was 14 and hadn't ever had the education to do the things she needed to do. I felt that I had the education and therefore it was my duty to take her work forward.\" </p> <p>Kitzinger talks openly about the fact - a statistical curiosity even to her most ardent fans - that three of her five daughters are lesbians. She says she has never wondered why. \"It may be very uncritical of me, people have questioned whether this may be a reaction to me and my work, that they've gone off and become lesbians in order to avoid childbirth but it all seems to make sense to me. My work dovetails absolutely with what my lesbian daughters are doing in the field of gender relationships, the right of women to decide on their own sexuality and express themselves openly.\" </p> <p>But behind this wall of rather categoric certainty I detect more than a hint of vulnerable conciliation, acceptance even that there has been a certain amount of negative fallout from her work. She has been hurt by accusations from journalists who have blamed her for their own difficulties with childbirth and breastfeeding. \"I pretend that it doesn't, but of course it hurts. I thoroughly enjoyed labour and everything I am doing and have always done in childbirth has to do with that joy. But I meet many women who have had terrible experiences, who are deeply traumatised by their birth experiences and I have to take that on board. I must confess that I find depression very difficult to cope with in anybody else because I've never been depressed.\" </p> <p>Unlike many in the natural birth movement, she supports women who choose to have an elective caesarean and accepts that some women \"feel deceived, cheated by their experience of birth. The NCT teachers would say we don't just teach for women who want drug-free births and that's true, but their whole raison d'etre is just that. The NCT says that women must be able to make informed choices and that's important, but I think we need to go a stage further and acknowledge the emotional pain and all the pressures that women are under. Childbirth has become a performance art and that's so sad because it is an intense living experience involving all our emotions.\" </p> <p>Though she was a founder member of the NCT she fell out with the organisation for a time in the 70s when she published The Good Birth Guide. They decided that the book was causing harm, undermining the good relations with senior hospital staff that they had painfully built up over the years, and passed an overwhelming vote of no confidence in her. \"It's silly really, but that still hurts.\" </p> <p>Clearly she feels many of her ideals have been misrepresented. </p> <p>\"We've failed to see birth as something which is overwhelming and that relates to my image of the waves of the sea. This is not something you learn like you use a computer and have control over it and part of the glory of it is that you are overwhelmed just as you are when you are making love. Lots of people don't understand why I make the sexual analogy but when you're about to have an orgasm, you can't time it or say I'm going to breathe this way and it's going to be just right because I've practised, you go with it and you can't say no to it. It's the same with birth - certainly in the second stage of labour.\" </p> <p>Birth may be safer now than it has ever been, but things can and do go wrong and that understandably raises anxiety levels in the mother and all those around her. It was one last passing comment from Kitzinger which made me wonder whether it may be this all-pervasive anxiety about labour that lies at the root of our need to control it, whether that be \"naturally\" at home in a water pool, or plugged into a monitor in hospital. \"People feel the need to give advice because they're anxious. When I start dishing out advice it is usually because I'm not centred and it's usually dumb advice.\" I did a double-take - her books are full of advice. Is her need to control and inculcate better practise among new mothers actually born of an acute anxiety? Beneath that warrior revolutionary is there just another anxious, bossy, caring but controlling mother who asked me if I needed to go to the loo before I set off for home? </p> <p>\"I try not to say 'should' and I try to explore different things that women do in different circumstances and act as a channel for how women live their lives.\" So what advice would she give to all those women out there who feel they have failed to have the supremely enjoyable, quasi-sexual experience of childbirth that she is so openly exultant about? \"They probably have been let down by what they perceived as 'natural' childbirth, we often tell women that they ought to take control of aspects of their lives in a way which makes them feel failures as soon as it's unsuccessful. What we omit to talk about is the social situation in which they found themselves. If a woman says that she feels she has failed, my first reaction would be to say that I understand that and then I would ask if she felt that there were others who had failed her, and then you can begin to deconstruct it, the pressures that exist on the midwife or obstetrician.\" The idea that it may be the very ethos of natural childbirth that has failed women does not enter the equation. On with the revolution! </p> <p>\u0095 Rediscovering Birth by Sheila Kitzinger is published by Little Brown at \u00a318.99. Life after Birth by Kate Figes is published by Penguin at \u00a37.99</p>",
  "We arrived at Prospero's domain on a sweltering August night. Behind three gates, reached on foot by means of a path clinging to a promontory half-shrouded in clouds, Gore Vidal's and Howard Austen's villa at Ravello (south of Naples) is indeed well-named: La Rondinaia or swallow's nest. It strangely reminded me of Hitler's eagle's nest at Bertchesgaden - if only in this respect: it, too, is the domain of a paranoid genius. For who but a paranoid genius would so separate himself from the world? <p>From the tiny port below, Ravello is a death-defying taxi ride along a corniche road like the one on which Princess Grace of Monaco died. Perhaps this is why neither Gore nor Howard drives any more but instead use taxis and chauffeured cars to go back and forth from their inaccessible fortress. The combination of preprandial drinking and hairpin turns would certainly not be good for their health. Indeed the switchbacks carved into the limestone ledges are so narrow that the passage of a bus or a truck stops traffic behind you for several minutes. You have to be truly dedicated to visit Gore Vidal. We were. </p> <p>I had known Gore since about 1990 when my seventh novel, Any Woman's Blues, was published in Italy and Gore invited me to lunch at his apartment in Rome. It was a chilly lunch. He had a bone to pick with me. In one of my novels, I had quoted a witticism of his that had been repeated to me by a mutual friend, and Gore was pissed off. What I had thought of as a tribute to his wit, he had thought of as a deliberate misquotation or attack and we were off to a bad start. The witticism concerned Princess Margaret, one of his best pals, and Gore was stung. I apologised and we went on with our lugubrious lunch, but I felt unforgiven at heart. Gore was not drinking that day and he seemed terribly depressed. I left his apartment in Rome thinking: this is the saddest man I've ever met. But his rare intelligence intrigued and delighted me (as it always had in his extraordinary books) and I was eager to see him again. He gave me an autographed copy of his edition of the stories of Tennessee Williams and in the front flap I remember writing about the afternoon: \"The coldest man I've ever met and the saddest. What is at the root of his sadness? The depression is contagious. I came away very depressed.\" </p> <p>Gore represented an enigma to me: a man with the world at his feet who seemed so terribly hurt by the smallest slight. If he could nurse a grudge about a throwaway line in a novel, imagine what melancholy lurked beneath that guarded, aristocratic exterior. He fascinated me. I loved his writing, was dazzled by his intellectual courage, and I was prepared to like the man, but his grievance-collecting got in the way. Still, a mutual friend kept bringing us together. Whenever we met, I sensed great vulnerability in this complex and brilliant man. Maybe I was even a little in love with his fierce intellect. I do tend to fall in love with exceptional brains. </p> <p>Once in Ravello, a lovely car-free town clinging to the top of a cliff above the sea, you proceed on foot to the gates of a small hotel where you encounter the first set of bells, mounted on a stucco wall. There it says: La Rondinaia. You ring the bell and proceed along a private path that clings to the mountainside. The view is dizzying and will become ever more so as you proceed toward the lair of the maestro. Another gate, another bell. Howard Austen, Gore's companion of 30-plus years, answers, saying in his New York accent: \"Go neither left nor right but straight ahead until you can go no more. There will be another gate.\" (Three gates to the city, hallelujah!) </p> <p>Another precipitous path, clouds below, cypresses and umbrella pines above. A marmalade cat comes out to greet you with a wriggling grey mouse in its teeth. For this is the house of a cat-lover whose practised hauteur belies his tenderness. Gore Vidal is a brilliant writer who needs to be told constantly how brilliant he is. </p> <p>We walk along the pine needle- softened path (led by the cat with the dying mouse in its mouth), until we come to the third gate - this one unmarked. Again we ring. Again Howard's voice leads us: \"Go neither right nor left but straight ahead.\" The pool will be below. Again we obey. </p> <p>Soon we are descending a rocky stair that leads to a dark azure pool and, standing beside it, Prospero himself, an amber sunset whiskey in his hand. </p> <p>Gore is rather more bearish than the last time I saw him, but still handsome, his leonine head beginning to soften with dewlaps, his fiercely intelligent eyes surrounded by innumerable wrinkles. None of this uglifies him. Ageing has only made him more charismatic somehow. </p> <p>You think of Byron at Missolonghi, ravaged by life at 36. But Gore is 75 and has had a good long run of looks, love, fame, fortune. Both life and literature have been good to him - if literature can ever be said to be good to any misunderstood genius. Literature is a mean mistress who always betrays her lovers in the end, refusing promised glories, proffering instead out-of-print books, publishing houses sold to movie studios and television networks, decades of passionately-written novels forgotten as a new generation comes along demanding books written in their own voice. But despite all that, it's been a good run. He was a beautiful young man, a bestselling author at 21 and now, living in splendour like a Renaissance prince, he is still writing at the top of his form. </p> <p>\"If I were a great writer,\" he says, \"I could be living in Brooklyn Heights.\" </p> <p>He is referring to that dinner party I gave for him in New York a few years ago to which Norman Mailer - who lives in Brooklyn Heights - also came. (The two one-time enemies actually broke bread together.) </p> <p>\"But you are a great writer,\" I say. </p> <p>\"I know,\" he says playfully. \"But I'd be even greater if I lived in Brooklyn Heights.\" </p> <p>\"I think Norman's in Provincetown this summer,\" I say. </p> <p>\"Even better!\" Gore roars. \"Maybe I'd be great if I lived in Provincetown.\" </p> <p>I think how odd it is that he should raise his old enmity with Norman. But I know writers - \"ingrown toenails\" as Henry Miller (who preferred to hang out with painters) called us. It is not enough to succeed. All your friends and contemporaries must fail. Writers are like this even when we try like hell not to be. </p> <p>I myself hate that old Hemingwayesque paradigm of the writer as prizefighter and I have tried hard to create an alternate one for myself. When Anne Sexton admonished me, \"We are all writing God's poem,\" I took it to mean there should be no competition between writers because we are all involved in a common project, a common prayer. But to Gore's and Norman's generation, particularly those male writers who served in the second world war, the prizefighter paradigm remains. They still want to KO each other, even at 70-odd. In a way, this is the tragedy of their generation. Their teeth were cut on the war and they never relinquished its us-and-them mentality. </p> <p>Gore tells us about the house. It is a cliff-dwelling, on many levels, and the rock it perches on is so steep that a glance over the balcony from his study gives me instant vertigo. Once owned by the daughter of an English Victorian lord, La Rondinaia has innumerable acres of terraces where grapes, olives and lemons grow, towering cedars, endless steps and balconies above the sea. It is not accessible by automobile. You must walk to this eyrie, an anomaly that has obviously preserved it as one of the most beautiful spots on earth. </p> <p>\"How does it go?\" Gore asks. \"Perfection of the life or of the work? One of the stupidest lines in English poetry. Who was it?\" </p> <p>\"Yeats,\" I said. </p> <p>\"Ridiculous,\" said Gore. \"The truth is you don't have to choose.\" </p> <p>\"Choose what?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Perfection of the life or of the work. Neither is possible.\" </p> <p>So we wander up the steps to the house and are shown some of it: the hall leading to the salotto with its 17th-century canvases, the salotto itself with its Graeco-Roman head of Zeus and first century mosaic floor mounted as a wallpiece (which cannot be taken out of Italy, says Howard). Gore seems a bit bored with the house tour as if he has done it a few too many times. </p> <p>Howard brings us drinks, complaining of the heat. He and I commiserate about global warming. Then we follow Gore into his study overlooking the sea as if from heaven, the guest suite that might have been ours had we been invited to stay, the terrace overlooking the sea where Sting and Trudie, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins sang all night at a July 4th party, the grand dining room with its faux-Roman chairs (from the movie set of Ben-Hur), the sitting room with its framed pictures of old pal Princess Margaret. </p> <p> And so at last to sup at the newly refurbished Hotel Sasso, a restored palazzo also hanging over the sea. At the main square in Ravello, Gore is greeted by all and sundry as \"maestro\". An agreeable thing for a famous artist who becomes a habitu\u00e9 of this country is the nod to the maestro that is semi-automatic with Italians. Like Americans, Italians may not read, but they understand that a maestro, even a maestra, is someone to be honoured. If they cannot really distinguish between the brilliance of a Gore Vidal and, say, the pulp of a Danielle Steel, at least they know that a scrittore or scrittrice is a person of consequence. </p> <p>Tongue loosened by many drinks, Gore discusses his plans for his estate. Upon his demise, La Rondinaia will become a study centre for his alma mater, the St Alban's school - but how to administer it? Gore has reached the age of estate-planning. I am all too familiar with this age and also with the cat-and-mouse game benefactors play with their possible heirs. </p> <p>Sitting in the bar for yet another round of drinks before dinner, Gore and Howard opine on what a perfect place the Sasso would be as a retirement home. When the universal condition of life - decay and death - catches up with even the most exalted artists, they succumb to primal fear. I realise I am sitting with an elderly gay couple without children who are facing their declining years with trepidation. They may have plenty of money, a fantastic villa on a promontory of the Italian coast, but they have already experienced a few health scares and they know they are no longer immune to death. </p> <p>That vulnerability is, I think, what makes The Golden Age, Gore's latest novel, so remarkable even in his remarkable oeuvre. He has always been an essayist who fell into the writing of novels and some of his novels seem more essays than novels. But in this one, as in Smithsonian Institution, his last historical fiction, there is an understanding of history and its vicissitudes that no other contemporary writer possesses. </p> <p>Long before anyone else, Gore identified what he dubbed \"The National Security State\", a United States that prepares constantly for war while preaching peace, and nailed its root cause: the need to keep the wheels of commerce turning to the tune of billions of dollars of defence spending per year. Like the 18th-century philosophers who framed the Constitution, he is for a true republic in which the people who participate have some grasp of history. He is outraged by the course the United States has taken in the past 50 years, as indeed the framers of its Constitution would be. Gore sees a Congress bought by special interests, and two parties vying to keep the war machine up and running with American tax dollars. </p> <p>I recently asked Gore what he thought of the-too-close-to-call race between George W Bush and Al Gore, his distant cousin. He replied: \"They are both part of a political system neither of them invented, but Albert is much more intelligent. If you have a bad system, the best thing to do is pick the most intelligent leader. Clearly Al Gore is more intelligent. But the rot goes deep and the system will crumble if we just wait. One big plunge of the stock market could topple the corporate interests that run things.\" </p> <p>Then he talked about his tour through Britain, speaking at Cambridge and Oxford, encountering huge crowds of students everywhere he went. He was impressed by the young people who came to hear him, far less impressed by reviewers of his latest novel who seemed to have no historical education and therefore no context in which to place his fiction. For a writer steeped in Herodotus and Plotinus to be reviewed by those who have read neither must be galling. </p> <p>Gore is at heart an 18th-century man who belongs among those framers of the American Constitution - men who knew their Greek and Roman history and philosophy, and took the long, historical view of governments. His living on a promontory surrounded by ancient artefacts is indeed just what an 18th- century philosopher would do. He lives in splendid isolation - aiming fiery feuilletons at a dumb and dumber world. </p> <p>Gore Vidal understands what America might be if it didn't betray its own ideals - the ideals we gave the world and then renounced in favour of corporate oligarchy and the perpetual war machine. </p> <p>When we said goodbye after dinner and headed back to the sailboat we had anchored on the coast, I was inspired. Gore Vidal is everything a writer should be: a voice for sanity in a mad world. </p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Erica Mann Jong. All rights reserved.

  "Leaders of the fuel tax protests have split into warring camps, accusing each other of hijacking the movement, while promoting rival direct action plans - including blockading supermarket food distribution centres - if Gordon Brown fails to meet their demands next month. <p>At the centre of the infighting are two of the most prominent leaders of last month's fuel blockades, Brynle Williams, the 51-year-old Welsh smallholder, who kicked off the protests at Stanlow refinery in Cheshire, and David Handley, chairman of the People's Fuel Lobby, who has made the running since the blockades were called off. </p> <p>Mr Williams yesterday accused Mr Handley of \"running round the country setting up splinter groups.\" </p> <p>\"He's creating an element of fear among the public,\" said Mr Williams. \"I don't know what his real agenda is.\" He added there was a risk that \"everything that has been gained up to now will be lost\". </p> <p>Mr Handley, 48, who was last week bailed by police after being held overnight following alleged damage to a meat processing plant in Merthyr Tydfil, said of Mr Williams: \"Who does he represent? I'm waiting for the man to come out and say who he represents.\" </p> <p>The row is partly a battle over leadership and organisation and partly an argument over tactics in the run-up to the 60-day deadline - set by Mr Williams as he called off the blockade at the Stanlow refinery in Cheshire - and the chancellor prepares to reveal his response. </p> <p>The farmers' and hauliers' groups are unlikely to be satisfied by whatever concessions he makes. But they also know that, given the preparations of government and police, they will not achieve the impact on fuel supplies they had last month by blockading oil refineries. </p> <p>Among the alternatives being suggested by protest organisers are blockades of supermarket food distribution depots. </p> <p>The country's five main supermarket chains - Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Safeway and Waitrose - operate around 50 giant warehouses, which are the hub of daily fresh food deliveries. Protesters have blocked individual depots briefly in the past and are convinced they are an easy target. But some protesters fear such a move would alienate public support. </p> <p>Robert Burns, a leader of last month's Grangemouth blockade, insists: \"Unless the government meets our demand and reduces the duty on fuel within the 60 days, all hell will break loose. It will be like Armageddon. People can live without fuel but they can't live without food.\" </p> <p>Protest organisers are also considering blockades of ports and feeder terminals, like the St Fergus oil and gas terminal near Aberdeen, which pipes oil from the North Sea and elsewhere down to Grangemouth, Scotland's only refinery. Protesters reckon St Fergus, which needs regular fuel supplies to keep the pumps going, would be easier to shut down than the high-profile Grangemouth. </p> <p>Orchestrated national grid power surges and main road lorry go-slows could form a third line of attack for protesters. Some groups believe that while police will be able to crack down on motorway blockades - one idea floated publicly this week has nevertheless been to block the M25 - it will be more difficult to stop go-slows on A roads. </p> <p>But so far the only definite plan is for a national demonstration in London, called for November 14 by Mr Handley's group. \"Unless Mr Brown slashes fuel tax,\" Mr Handley said yesterday, \"we intend to bring the country to London and have the fishermen come up the Thames.\" </p> <p>But other protest organisers are having none of it, accusing Mr Handley, a Conservative supporter who is also a leader of the direct action group Farmers for Action, of being a failing farmer intent on carving a new career out of his new role. </p> <p>\"North Wales will not be on Handley's march,\" Clive Swann, one of last month's protest organisers, said yesterday. \"Has he been got at, trying to get us all down to London, while the rest of the country's safe? There's no need to form an organisation to make a protest - it leaves you wide open to infiltration by political factions like the National Front.\" </p> <p>Richard Haddock, who was spokesman for the blockades in Plymouth, is also critical of the People's Fuel Lobby, set up in Stafford after last month's protest, complaining that \"the south-west has never been invited to go to a meeting\". He is also a Conservative supporter, but warns other groups against \"holding a gun to the head of the government\". </p> <p>Mr Handley rejects the criticism and insists his only agenda is to win a fuel tax cut of 26 pence for the British people. But as the November 13 deadline approaches, Brynle Williams, the original leader of the protests, is angry that any campaigning is currently taking place at all. </p> <p>\"I'm fed up - I said nothing should happen for 60 days,\" he said yesterday. \"One minute I'm the man everyone's supposed to look to and next they're creating splinter groups. What I'm terrified of with these meetings they're holding is that a group of people will kick off somewhere, close a refinery, a supermarket, a petrol station and everything we gained up to now will be lost.\"</p>",
  "Sometime in the next few days, a snarky fellow with the remains of his hair plastered across the top of his head will appear before a huge crowd celebrating itself in lower Manhattan. <p>There at City Hall the emperor of New York, who has been fading from view over the past five months, will make his last significant stand while his beloved Yankees or the city's other baseball team, the Mets, process their way along the Canyon of Heroes in a ticker-tape parade for the sport's world champions. </p> <p>It just hasn't been the same without Rudy Giuliani. New York's mayor has not disappeared entirely - walking on an ethnic parade here; swigging down some bottled water to show that it isn't poisoned there; instructing the citizenry to take their flu jabs. </p> <p>But this is only tokenism for \"the man who saved New York.\" Once, no errant hotdog vendor, jaywalker, pet owner, magazine editor, or purveyor of adult entertainment could be confident of escaping his wrath. No fire was worth the flame without Rudy in his hard hat at the scene; no power cut, or outage in the rough lexicon of the city, sufficient to command attention without the crisis manager/mayor there to scorn it; no storm had really whipped up unless Giuliani was on hand to close New York at lunchtime and tell everyone to go home. </p> <p>Now the city doesn't seem to have fires, power cuts or storms any more. The most combative, best-known mayor in the United States, long since departed from the contest with Hillary Clinton for a seat in the Senate, plays a lot more golf these days. </p> <p>In truth, his job is done, seven years after he started the task of proving wrong the sceptics who said that New York was simply unmanageable. It is a more bland place, where even some of the better-off have been dispatched to the outer boroughs in search of an affordable roof over their heads. But crime is way down, by 57% in the serious categories, more for murder. </p> <p>The law prevents Giuliani from standing for a third term so he has to go at the end of next year, making orphans of some of his more grandiose schemes, such as those for new sports stadia all over Manhattan. </p> <p>With nothing much left to do he has even talked about being nicer, a better person; perhaps he would even \"reach out\" to a few black leaders. Gone are the days when members of his administration were entitled to wonder if they might be dispatched in the night in the political equivalent of the organised crime figures Giuliani sent down when he was a prosecutor. </p> <p>It would be tasteless to characterise as a lame duck a man who is dealing with prostrate cancer, a second broken marriage and a recent book in which his much-loved father was demonstrated to be something of a roughneck who had served a little time himself. And, in fact, Giuliani has not forgotten where he keeps his hard hat. </p> <p>William Bratton is rated by some as the most successful commissioner of the New York Police Department in the force's history. Giuliani hates him. When crime plunged during his tenure, Bratton claimed a large slice of the credit, perhaps not unreasonably as the city's senior police officer. But that was too much for the mayor, who was not having a show-pony steal the action he was sure should have been his. Bratton had to depart and four years ago he did, to the ex-policeman's usual refuge, the security industry. </p> <p>Recently Bratton, a charmer with a new wife, put it about that maybe it wouldn't be such a bad thing if he were to succeed Giuliani as mayor. The former police chief might have been serious when he said: \"I would fully expect if I were the Republican nominee that the mayor, who is a supporter of the Republican party, would be there to support me.\" If so, he had forgotten his man. </p> <p>Giuliani was asked if he would do anything to stand in Bratton's way. \"How long have I been mayor?\" he asked. \"You know me. Okay, you figure it out.\" </p> <p>Nor did the mayor soften once he had subjected the notion to mature reflection. \"Stay out of the Republican party, otherwise the Republican mayor of New York City will do everything he can to oppose you,\" he said. He noted also that Bratton, like Hillary Clinton, had committed an unpardonable crime which was enough on its own to disqualify him: he was foolish enough to have been born somewhere other than in the city. </p> <p>\"I'm getting tired of these people from out of town (Boston, in Bratton's case) trying to run for office in New York. I don't think he's qualified to be mayor of New York and only I would know that because I worked with him.\" In the end, Bratton decided that this was not the time to run. </p> <p>The favourite to succeed Giuliani is Mark Green, the Democrat who is the city's public advocate, an office that is not as grand as it sounds. It means he is the consumer affairs commissioner and, in the interests of consistency, it should be noted that Giuliani can't stand him either. </p> <p>The mayor even tried, and failed, to change the law last year to keep Green from stepping into his shoes should Giuliani have beaten Mrs Clinton and left office a year early to go to Washington. </p> <p>And then there is the Reverend Al Sharpton, the former James Brown road manager who is trying to transfer his talent for troublemaking into the mainstream. He came second in the last Democratic primary to choose a mayoral candidate and is said to be mulling over another go. </p> <p>Naturally, Giuliani cannot bear him either. The mayor has given up putting out fires but he might ignite a few before he goes. </p>",
  "The home secretary's power to set minimum periods in jail for murderers serving mandatory life sentences is to be challenged in two high court test cases brought under the Human Rights Act. <p>Lord Justice Pill, sitting with Mr Justice Potts, yesterday ordered that the cases of lifers Anthony Anderson and John Taylor should be heard together as a matter of urgency. </p> <p>The judges said the prisoners' lawyers would argue that the home secretary's powers to set tariffs for retribution and deterrence were \"incompatible\" with the Human Rights Act, which incorporates the European convention on human rights into domestic law. </p> <p>The judges, sitting in London, ordered that similar cases should be put on hold pending the court's decision. </p> <p>Anderson, 38, was sentenced to life at the Old Bailey in 1998 for murdering two men. The trial judge, with the agreement of the lord chief justice, recommended a 15-year tariff after saying Anderson \"picked upon feeble victims\" whom he \"immobilised\" with violence so they could not prevent him stealing from their homes. </p> <p>In July 1997 the home secretary, Jack Straw, increased the minimum term Anderson must serve to 20 years. Mr Straw said the higher tariff was justified because Anderson had killed on two separate occasions. </p> <p>Taylor, 50, was convicted of murder at Sheffield crown court in January 1989. The trial judge and the lord chief justice set his tariff at 16 years, but in March this year Mr Straw increased it to 22 years. </p> <p>Taylor's lawyers will argue at the full application for judicial review that, in addition to the human rights issues, the tariff period was \"perverse and manifestly excessive\". </p> <p>\u0095 The lord chief justice, Lord Woolf, will announce his decision today on the correct tariff for the schoolboy killers of two-year-old James Bulger, which could see Robert Thompson and Jon Venables being freed early next year. </p> <p>Press Association</p>",
  "Israeli civilians are making their own arrangements to protect themselves, accusing the army of timidity. Gun dealers in Jerusalem reported sales of weapons and ammunition up to 10 times the normal figure yesterday and shooting ranges were doing a brisk trade. <p>Among those honing their skills at the Krav shooting range was Shifra Hoffman, founder of Victims of Arab Terror, a rightwing group which regards a peace agreement with the Palestinians as a sham and urges ordinary Israelis to arm themselves. </p> <p>\"We are not vigilantes,\" she said, \"but we see the government is speaking and talking while people are being shot.\" </p> <p>Although the UN has condemned the Israeli army for excessive use of force in the past few weeks, many Israelis believe it has been too restrained. They cite two incidents in Nablus in which Israelis bled to death while awaiting army help. </p> <p>Ronen Rabani, manager of the Krav range, said demand for ammunition and weapons has risen tenfold since the violence began on September 28. </p> <p>\"In the past three weeks we have sold all the stock we had for the next three to five months,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Everybody wants to order a weapon, not just people who live on the other side of the Green Line\" - settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. </p> <p>As he spoke, an Orthodox Jew with a beard and black hat inspected an Austrian Glock handgun. </p> <p>Steve Averbach, chief instructor at Krav, said that 90% of Israelis had received military training, but with rifles, not handguns. </p> <p>\"Most of the people coming to us are in the process of changing weapons - trading in real antiques for something they could use,\" he said. </p> <p>\"They are living in areas where they need to be better protected.\" </p> <p>Mr Averbach said that those undergoing training had applied for licences several weeks before the latest violence broke out - \"The signs were already there.\" </p> <p>Of the 130 people killed since the end of September, all but eight have been Arabs. </p> <p>According to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, between the outbreak of the first intifada in 1987 and the end of September this year 270 Israeli civilians and 135 members of the security forces were killed by Palestinian civilians. In the same period 1,407 Palestinian civilians were killed by the Israeli security forces and 140 by Israeli civilians. </p> <p>\"Every citizen who would like to have a private gun is entitled to apply for a licence,\" a government spokesman said. \"But they cannot buy one until they have a licence from the interior ministry. The ministry checks with the police and the defence forces and issues a licence if the citizen is suitable.\" A certificate of mental health is also required. </p> <p>But a B'Tselem spokesman said the rules on gun possession varied from area to area. \"Inside the Green Line [Israel's pre-1967 borders], people can only buy small non-automatic weapons, usually 9mm, and there should be a reason for wanting them - such as living in a dangerous area,\" he said. </p> <p>\"In the larger settlements, the rules are basically the same, but in the smaller settlements it is possible for civilians to get automatic weapons from the army. </p> <p>\"Even very extreme settlers can get army guns, and most adult men in the small settlements have them. </p> <p>\"In this situation, it's natural and even understandable that they should have some weapons to protect themselves. The worrying thing is not just that extreme settlers might shoot the Palestinians. In a few places settlers are trying to take Palestinians' land by threatening them with guns provided by the army.\" </p> <p>Figures for the number of licences issued recently by the interior ministry were unavailable yesterday. </p> <p>\u0095 Tension has begun to ease in the West Bank and Gaza, a senior Israeli official said yesterday. Gilead Sher, chief of staff in the prime minister's office, said Israeli generals and Palestinian security chiefs were about to resume high-level security contacts. </p> <p>That followed hints by President Clinton that he might invite the prime minister, Ehud Barak, and Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, for separate talks in Washington if both sides made efforts to quell the violence.</p>",

A deep red background with the marbled features of Naughtie, MacGregor and Humphrys gazing stoically into a glorious future (pictured).

  "Thomas Jefferson and Ronald Reagan have been enlisted to assist a push for the legalisation of marijuana in Alaska. <p>If the proposition were to pass when it goes before the state's electorate on November 7 the same day as the presidential election across the country, Alaska would become the only US state where marijuana could be consumed legally by all adults. </p> <p>It is one of more than 200 propositions that will be put to electors in 42 states on polling day. The range of issues can cover anything from drug laws and gay marriages to education policy and euthanasia. </p> <p>In Alaska, the pro-marijuana lobby has pressed Jefferson, the third US president, into service on the website of the Anchorage-based Hemp2000 campaign group, quoting his maxim: \"The greatest service which can be rendered any country is to add a useful plant to its culture.\" </p> <p>The group hopes that the Alaskan belief that government should interfere as little as possible in citizens' lives could lead to victory. </p> <p>Under Alaska's Proposition 5, the drug could be used by anyone over 18, and an amnesty would be given to those with marijuana-related convictions. </p> <p>Supporters gathered 41,000 signatures to get the measure on the ballot, which is around a tenth of all voters and nearly double the 22,000 required. A quote from former president Ronald Reagan is also part of the campaign literature: \"Government exists to protect us from each other. Where government has gone beyond its limits is in deciding to protect us from ourselves.\" </p> <p>\"It's going to be a tight one,\" Wanda Carp, the treasurer of Hemp2000, predicted yesterday. Describing herself as a 50-year-old grandmother who had spent most of her life in the state, Ms Carp said that opponents were presenting Proposition 5 \"as if we're going to become the drug haven of the United States but that is just not true\". </p> <p>The measure has been criticised as \"foolish and dangerous\" by Tony Knowles, governor of a state where alcoholism and other forms of addiction have done much harm to residents, both native and non-native. </p> <p>The local Alaska Poll conducted last month found 35% in favour of legalising marijuana and 42% strongly opposed. Ms Carp thought the vote would be even closer: \"It may be by the hair of our chinny-chin-chin, but it'll pass.\" </p> <p>Alaska, the \"last frontier\" state with a landmass twice that of Texas, has a history of such measures. The authorities already take a fairly relaxed attitude to marijuana, punishing possession with a small fine, much like a parking ticket. In 1975, under a right to privacy ruling by the state court, small quantities of marijuana were permitted for residents but this was revoked at the ballot box in 1990. </p> <p>The proposition is the most radical on the issue of drugs but six other states will be asked to back measures to legalise marijuana for medical use or change the ways in which drug users are treated. </p> <p>Supporters of medical marijuana use say that it helps to alleviate the effects of chemotherapy and Aids. Opponents say that the measures are the thin end of a wedge that would see harder drugs legalised. </p> <p>Voters in 42 states have a total of 204 measures to decide on. If trends of the last decade hold up, roughly half of these measures will pass. </p> <p>Many of the propositions have been drafted with great attention to detail in order not to be deemed to be too vague for enforcement. In Colorado, for instance, a person entitled to medical marijuana would be allowed two ounces and six plants of which three could be flowering. </p> <p>In Massachusetts, the drug proposition would change the civil forfeiture law under which the authorities seize and keep the assets of people convicted of drug offences. Under the proposition the seized money would go to drug rehabilitation projects; it also proposes treatment for low-level first time users. </p> <p>Nevada will again be voting on medical marijuana as its state law requires that such measures achieve a majority vote in two consecutive elections; it got approval in 1998. </p> <p>California will be deciding on whether to have drug offenders treated and put on parole rather than jailed in what is the most controversial and potentially far-reaching proposition on the state's ballots. </p> <p>In Oregon, voters have to decide on 26 proposals, including a ban on promoting or sanctioning homosexual and bisexual behaviour in schools and a ban on the use of \"body-gripping\" animal traps. </p> <p>Nebraska will be voting on gay civil marriages and Colorado on gun restrictions.</p>",
  "The IRA statement yesterday that it will allow the \"re- inspection\" of some arms bunkers \"to confirm that our weapons remain secure\" is hardly a life-line for the beleaguered David Trimble. \"Reinspection\" is not the same as opening up other storehouses of the IRA's vast arsenal and few would expect its already inspected weapons to be other than \"secure\" at this stage. Had the IRA been prepared to open up more bunkers, then its statement would offer the first minister some comfort. In the event it is likely to exacerbate the tensions in his party. To the Trimble camp, the IRA statement is seen as little more than a well-timed stunt. <p>So yet again Mr Trimble will step on to the tightrope at Belfast's Waterfront Hall this Saturday, before the gaze of the 860 delegates of his party's ruling council. Peter Mandelson, who has equated Mr Trimble's survival with the survival of the Good Friday agreement itself, will be keeping his fingers crossed that Mr Trimble won't fall off. </p> <p>The collapse of the peace process in the Middle East, when a final settlement at Camp David seemed so tantalisingly close, is a tragic reminder of how quickly peace can revert to war. At the moment, however, it seems that supporters of the agreement need not hold their breath. The high-wire walker is unlikely to fall off, at least not during this Saturday's performance. </p> <p>Mr Trimble, whose political skills have been tested to the limit as he has cajoled a reluctant Unionist party into making concessions that his predecessors would never have dreamed of, knows it would be suicidal to fly in the face of growing opposition in his ranks to sharing power with Sinn Fein without evidence of genuine IRA decommissioning. </p> <p>Like Banquo's ghost, it is the spectre that has haunted the peace process since the IRA ceasefire of 1994. Yesterday's IRA statement only underlines the fact. To date, the only comfort on offer to unionists is the mandatory flying of the Union flag on government buildings, including those occupied by Sinn Fein's two ministers, on high days and holidays. It is hardly the flag of the Fifth Cavalry. </p> <p>But Mr Trimble is likely to survive on Saturday because a deal will probably be hammered out with the dissident wing in his party, whereby the first minister and his Ulster Unionist colleagues in the new executive will gradually withdraw support from the institutions of the agreement, until such time as the IRA begins to decommission in a meaningful way - and this means more than just reopening a few bunkers for re- inspection. Mr Trimble calls the tactic a \"considered and calibrated\" approach. </p> <p>It would probably begin with abstention from the cross-border bodies, which Sinn Fein sees as the doorway to a united Ireland, and culminate in withdrawal from the executive itself which would almost certainly crash the political engine of the agreement - unless, of course, Peter Mandelson steps in and suspends it first as he did so controversially last February. At all costs, Mr Trimble will seek to head off those who wish to specify dangerous timetables and deadlines for decommissioning. The IRA does not respond to such pressure. </p> <p>Unionist delegates also have a pressing self-interest in presenting the face of party unity, however temporary it may be, after the party lost its second safest seat to Ian Paisley's DUP in last month's South Antrim byelection. With a general election around the corner, the party fears meltdown unless it can regain the ground it has lost to Mr Paisley, who taunts Mr Trimble for capitulating to the IRA's agenda. Mr Trimble's own dissidents agree: Sinn Fein is in government, IRA prisoners are out, the RUC faces change beyond recognition - and the IRA has not given up a single bullet. The fact that its guns are largely silent and the province is enjoying a period of peace, however imperfect, it has not known for 30 years, does not figure in the dissidents' equation. Memories of what life used to be like are perilously short. </p> <p>The irony is that the Good Friday agreement has split the Ulster Unionists far more than it has split the republican movement - the IRA and Sinn Fein. Since Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness began their journey to Good Friday way back in the late 1980s, their overriding concern has been to bring the IRA with them every step of the way. True, dissidents left the republican movement to form the Continuity IRA in 1986 and the Real IRA in 1997, but, despite their recently growing strength, neither has heralded the major split Adams and McGuinness have striven to avoid. </p> <p>This is surprising given what their comrades in the IRA and Sinn Fein have had to swallow: participation in a partitionist Stormont government; acceptance of the principle of unionist \"consent\"; and the abolition of Dublin's constitutional claim to the north. But for the IRA, decommissioning, at least in terms of handing over weapons, remains the ne plus ultra. For the IRA to state as it did that it would \"initiate a comprehensive process to put arms beyond use\", and to do so by opening up some of its bunkers for independent inspection, was stretching its constituency to the limit. </p> <p>Yet, as far as General John de Chastelain's commission is concerned, this gesture is not decommissioning but merely a \"confidence-building measure\" ahead of it. The general's remit remains the destruction of terrorist weaponry and to date the government has not indicated otherwise. Destruction is certainly what Mr Trimble's dissidents insist on, too. </p> <p>The Provos are already acutely conscious of the growing threat from the Real IRA. Nothing illustrates the tensions more than the killing of Joseph O'Connor, one of the Real IRA's Belfast leaders, in Ballymurphy almost a fort night ago in a shooting widely believed to be the work of the Provisionals, determined to maintain control of streets where the Provos were born in 1970 and where Gerry Adams has his roots. </p> <p>If Mr Trimble is looking to the IRA for more help, it may be found in its announcement that it has decided to resume discussions with de Chastelain. This may offer some hope that the issue can finally be resolved. But Trimble needs action not words while even senior members of Sinn Fein who no doubt urged the IRA to go into print before Saturday know there are limits to how far they can push the IRA. David Trimble is not the only leader walking the tightrope. No one wants to walk the plank. </p> <p>Peter Taylor was the presenter of Brits, the recent BBC2 series</p>",
  "State prosecutors want to try David Shayler, the former MI5 officer accused of breaking the Official Secrets Act, behind closed doors, it was disclosed yesterday. <p>The Crown Prosecution Service, which is seeking a court ruling to that effect, said pre-trial hearings should also be held in secret for \"reasons of national security\". </p> <p>The move was condemned by Mr Shayler and his lawyer, John Wadham, the director of Liberty, the human rights group. </p> <p>\"One of the fundamental principles of our criminal justice system is openness\", Mr Wadham said last night. \"This case is all about freedom of speech and to gag the press from reporting is wrong in principle\". </p> <p>Mr Shayler, who returned voluntarily from France in August to face charges, said: \"Open justice is supposed to be bred in the bone of our common law and trial by our peers in the open, a central tenet of the criminal justice system.\" </p> <p>The move by the CPS comes just days after it served notice that it was seeking a ruling to try in secret Lieutenant Colonel Nigel Wylde, who is accused of supplying information to a journalist about surveillance operations in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The Guardian intends to appeal against a ruling by the courts to bow to the prosecution's demands in the two cases. </p> <p>It is highly unusual for the prosecution to demand a secrets act trial to be held behind closed doors. During the cold war even spy trials were only partly heard in camera. </p> <p>Mr Shayler is accused of passing information to the Mail on Sunday in 1997 when the newspaper revealed that MI5 held files on prominent Labour leaders and pop musicians. </p> <p>It also made allegations of MI5 incompetence in monitoring the activities of suspected Libyan intelligence officers. </p> <p>Since then, allegations by Mr Shayler about MI6 involvement in a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, about MI5's handling of the bombing of the Israeli embassy in London in 1994 and the IRA bombing of Bishopsgate in the City of London the previous year, have been published without government interference. </p> <p>MI5 and MI6 have made it clear that they are concerned about the prospect of more embarrassing information emerging in open court. The indictment against Mr Shayler also covers 60 documents he is alleged to have taken out of MI5 headquarters. </p> <p>However, Mr Wadham said last night: \"There may be some parts of the trial itself that need to be held in secret but not the preliminary hearings and not the whole of the trial.\" </p> <p>Both Mr Shayler and Lt Col Wylde argue that the Official Secrets Act is incompatible with the Human Rights Act because it reverses the burden of proof and does not allow a public interest defence - reasons why Labour opposed the act in opposition in 1989. </p> <p>All prosecutions under the secrets act need the consent of the attorney general, Lord Williams, a keen supporter of the Human Rights Act.</p>",

  "The expression on the face of the silver-haired man spoke volumes. Through the window of the first-class carriage where he would spend the night, he looked as disgruntled as it is possible to be. <p>That was in Glasgow late on Tuesday; very soon similar expressions were to become commonplace across the country. </p> <p>The first hint of what was to come was at around 6pm. Railtrack announced it was imposing a 20mph speed limit on a 40 mile stretch of train track on the west coast mainline south of Law junction, in Lanarkshire. But there was more: from 8am yesterday this crucial arterial route connecting the west coast of Scotland to England would close for the 120 miles between Law and Gretna to allow inspection of the tracks. </p> <p>Almost immediately the fallout began. ScotRail cancelled its Caledonian sleeper services - the speed limit meant the train would not reach Glasgow before the track closure. With 700 passengers booked in, chaos ensued. In a vain attempt to alleviate it, the company first tried to charter an aircraft. When this failed, they began contacting passengers to warn them of the problems. But only a few were cautioned; and passengers arrived at stations in Fort William, Inverness, Aberdeen, Glasgow and London to be told the cross-border trains would not be running. </p> <p>\"It's abysmal the way we've been treated,\" said Alexander Armstrong, from London, who arrived at Glasgow Central to find the 23.25 sleeper service cancelled. </p> <p>\"Passengers should have been contacted rather than turning up at the station and finding out at the last minute.\" </p> <p><b> Scuppered</b><br> </p> <p>Stewart Francis, the chairman of the Rail Passengers' Council, concurred. \"You simply can't do this at the last moment. Safety is paramount, we accept that, and if there is a problem then lines must close. But information is the key - give passengers prior warning and at least there is a chance then of taking them with you as we go through what will be a very rocky period indeed.\" </p> <p>There was, at least, some sympathy from passengers for train operators. </p> <p>Alastair McPherson, the managing director of ScotRail, said his best efforts had been scuppered by the late timing of Railtrack's announcement. </p> <p>\"We operate the overnight sleeper services between five points in Scotland and London and we have had two or three hours' notice to make alternative arrangements for our passengers.\" </p> <p>For those arriving at the affected stations on Tuesday night who lived nearby, there was a fleet of taxis to take them home. For those from further afield, there was the offer of a hotel room or a sleeper berth. In London, Glasgow and Edinburgh passengers spent the night in the makeshift hotels of stationary carriages parked on railway sidings. </p> <p>Early yesterday morning many of these passengers were transferred on to the last England-bound train to leave Glasgow Central, becoming among the first to sample the day of disruption. </p> <p>At least 15 trains a day make the journey between Scotland and London, and Virgin Trains operates a string of other services on the west coast mainline. </p> <p>Around 40 services and 15,000 passen gers were directly affected yesterday by Railtrack's decision to close the line. Many thousands more were affected indirectly. </p> <p>Outside Glasgow Central, buses waited to take rail passengers to Carlisle. A journey which would normally take 80 minutes minutes would now last at least three hours. </p> <p>\"It is a totally unacceptable way to treat people,\" said Stephen Leeman, who was travelling to Leeds. Passengers tried to transfer to the east coast line, only to be told it was full. Plane services between Scotland and London filled quickly. The M74 motorway became congested as passengers took to their cars and freight was transferred to lorries. </p> <p>But yesterday's train travel chaos was not confined to Scotland. In the commuter heartland of Milton Keynes, station platforms filled with irate passengers as noticeboards informed of delay after delay. The Milton Keynes to Rugby section of the west coast mainline was severely disrupted. At around 9am yesterday the train station was a picture of havoc: a Virgin train stood stationary at one platform; local services were not moving from others. Passengers fumed as the first service to Gatwick airport was cancelled. </p> <p>\"The platforms were absolutely full: commuters, holidaymakers and parents with children on half-term break,\" said Nick Pandya, a librarian. \"People were, understandably, becoming more and more angry. The station staff seemed unable to manage the crisis and I thought they were going to be lynched at one point.\" </p> <p><b> Emergency timetable</b><br> </p> <p>Problems were also to be found further west. Many of Great Western's services to Cornwall were forced on to an emergency timetable as Railtrack imposed a 20mph speed limit between Totnes and Plymouth in Devon. Speed restrictions were brought in in Berkshire and Oxfordshire. For a train operator which has had 14 sections of the track it uses affected by speed limits since Hatfield, it was yet another burden. Great Western said the problems could last for another two weeks. </p> <p>The Midlands, northwest and northeast felt the disruption too as Virgin CrossCountry trains were either cancelled or subject to severe restrictions. Trains from London to the Midlands ran at least an hour late. </p> <p>Services to the northeast from Birmingham through Derby and York were severely delayed. In Anglia, more than 20 separate speed restrictions led to delays of an hour on London to Norwich services. Some trains were cancelled; services south of Colchester in Essex were the worst affected. </p> <p>Such was the scale of yesterday's chaos it made its way in to prime minister's questions. With almost every train operator in Britain reporting problems and hundreds of thousands of passengers facing long delays, Tony Blair told MPs: \"We need to renew our transport infrastructure - but it's a long term project.\" </p> <p>As passengers embarked on their vastly lengthened journeys, Gerald Corbett, the embattled chief executive of Railtrack, put it succinctly. </p> <p>\"It's going to be a difficult week.\"</p>",
  "Railtrack last night issued a stark warning to passengers of worsening conditions and lengthy delays on Britain's crumbling rail network lasting well into next year. <p>After a day in which thousands of travellers were subjected to increasing delays and overcrowding, Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's chief executive, frankly admitted: \"The re-railing programme following the Hatfield crash will take a number of months and passenger delays are inevitable.\" </p> <p>Mr Corbett declared that safety was the total priority. He apologised to passengers for the inconvenience but stopped short of advising them not to travel, even though it took many people the whole of yesterday to complete their journey. </p> <p>\"We are now going to have to blitz the network and run it for safety,\" said Mr Corbett. </p> <p>Train companies warned last night that it could take up to two weeks to clarify the safety issues. </p> <p>Following a meeting last night, the Association of Train Operating Companies said: \"Railtrack advised that it would take about two weeks to assess all potential sites and to develop a programme to address the issues.\" </p> <p>In a further sign of the disruption, the Royal Mail said last night that millions of letters were being delayed because of the disruption. </p> <p>Railtrack said that workers were currently inspecting more than 1,000 miles of track searching for broken rails and other possible defects. It said all of the network's 11,000 miles of track would eventually be inspected. </p> <p>The number of speed restrictions has more than doubled since the end of last week to almost 200, and could rise still further. </p> <p>Mr Corbett and other industry leaders spent yesterday in emergency meetings, ending with one last night in which they agreed action to act together to prevent the collapse of the system. </p> <p>The meeting involved maintenance contractors who angrily attacked Railtrack for blaming them for the failure of the railway. They said that Railtrack should own up to its own shortcomings. </p> <p>They are furious that Railtrack has issued a letter warning them that they must confirm by tomorrow that there are no outstanding safety issues. The letter is dated October 23. Railtrack says it wants to know what contractors are doing on every safety case. </p> <p>Contractors have been advised not to reply until their legal and insurance position has been clarified. \"A pistol is being put at our head. It displays an extraordinary degree of panic and lack of confidence, given the limited time we have been given to reply,\" said one contractor. </p> <p>Mr Corbett apologised for yesterday's decision to close part of the west coast line without notice, and without adequate warning for train operators and passengers. He said he was hopeful that it would be opened today with temporary speed restrictions. </p> <p>The company was \"systematically visiting all potential sites and assessing the risk\". Line teams had the legal responsibility for safety \"and are imposing speed restrictions where they think further investigation is necessary\". </p> <p>Railtrack explained that maintenance teams were monitoring the condition of all track. Where surface cracking had been identified, it had been treated by rail grinding. \"In more serious cases speed restrictions are imposed until ultra-sonic testing can be carried out and, where necessary, rails are replaced.\" </p> <p>Yesterday's hold-ups occurred mainly on Britain's three main rail arteries, the west and east coast main lines, and the Great Western line from Paddington. </p> <p>They led to heated rows between passengers and rail staff. Passengers from Manchester to London took five and a half hours to complete their journey, and at Birmingham last night passengers were delayed up to two hours. </p> <p>First Great Eastern, which runs services from London to East Anglia, yesterday warned of \"horrendous delays\" beyond Christmas, with \"blanket speed restrictions\" across its routes. All 25 rail companies have already drawn up emergency timetables, which are either operating already or will be introduced this week. </p> <p>London Underground yesterday joined Railtrack and Balfour Beatty - the companies responsible for track maintenance at Hatfield - on the first \"name and shame\" list published by the health and safety executive. A website will show which firms have been convicted of safety failures. </p> <p>Timothy Walker, the HSE's director general, said: \"I want this report to create pressure on those who have failed in their responsibilities towards workers and the public.\" </p> <p>The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers last night called for the industry to be brought back into the public sector. Phil McGarry, the union's Scottish regional organiser, said: \"It is clear that both the method and idea of privatisation has been a failure with no overall control, millions of pounds of taxpayers' money squandered and a less safe railway occurring as a result.\"</p>",
  "<p>The new Oxford Dictionary of Dance must rank as one of the year's most authoritative-looking volumes. Its dust jacket is coloured in sober greys and blues, while its contents are laid out in uncluttered, readable type. The facts seem to march confidently from one column to the next, almost as if they had written themselves. But as one of its authors, I know how slippery and quarrelsome those facts really are. </p> <p>I was commissioned to write the dictionary five years ago, together with another dance critic, Debra Craine of the Times. Both of us, I think, had a notion that we would be dealing with some fixed body of knowledge that would just be waiting for us to sort it into shape. Neither of us had any idea how much detective work and difficult choices would be involved. </p> <p>Our book had a predecessor - Horst Koegler's impressive Dictionary of Ballet, last updated by the Oxford University Press in 1987 - but our brief was to start again from scratch. Our editors wanted a more reader-friendly book that would encompass the volatile energy of today's dance scene. While retaining all the major historical information, we also needed to open the book up to more populist aspects of dance, such as the Riverdance phenomenon, salsa and hip-hop. But the inclusion of so many new entries meant that we had to delete a lot of those listed in the previous dictionary, and selecting our victims was often difficult - though it did produce the occasional, illicit, iconoclastic thrill. </p> <p>We intended to include many dancers and choreographers who had emerged in the last 20 years or so, as well as predicting the future prospects of younger artists. Having finally settled on our list, we started the long haul of researching and writing. But the wider we cast our net for source material, the more inconsistencies we encountered. The most trustworthy-seeming tomes started to feel unnervingly inconsistent and it began to dawn on us that there was no such thing as a 100% reliable reference book. Errors by proofreaders and typesetters had leaked into some texts. Worse, we had to navigate sprawling grey areas of interpretation. However objective writers seemed to be, opinion and taste inevitably influenced their descriptions of an artist's career or a company's history. We knew, too, that what we would eventually produce was going to be \"the world of dance as seen by Craine and Mackrell\". </p> <p>There were other practical difficulties. We had a hard time winkling out the birth dates of several artists. Dance is a youth-obsessed profession, and many of the men and women we approached were reluctant to disclose their ages. </p> <p>Dancers' geography can also be hard to pin down, though while I was working on some of the early 19th-century entries I was reminded what a nomadic profession it has always been. There were ballet masters who routinely commuted between Paris and St Petersburg during this period, while in 1840 the ballerina Fanny Elssler embarked on a tour of the Americas with a schedule that would be exhausting even today, with modern methods of transport. </p> <p>Had we realised what teeth-grindingly frustrating work writing this dictionary would be, I'm not sure we would have embarked on it. But the discipline of reading around the entire subject of dance did throw up some compensatory gems. We had decided early on to incorporate some extra essays and generic entries - partly as background for non-specialist readers, partly as a bit of light relief. </p> <p>I had serious fun writing our brief entry on socialist realism, sifting through the wackier Soviet examples. (Belsky's Coast of Hope, for instance, contrasted the lifestyles of two fishing villages: a shiny, happy communist village and a grimly exploitative capitalist one.) Researching entries that I thought had only a 20th-century dimension - such as sport or feminism - also threw up ballets of which I'd known nothing. One was Sports of England, choreographed in 1887 by Katti Lanner, a fascinating figure who virtually ran the London ballet scene at a time when directors and choreographers were almost exclusively male. Another was the work La R\u00e9volte au S\u00e9rail (1833), which portrayed the inmates of a harem banding together with local working women to overthrow the tyranny of men. It was choreographed by a man, Filippo Taglioni. </p> <p>Spare as most of the entries had to be, some did contain germs of wonderful stories from which we had to drag ourselves away. Before I wrote this dictionary, I had no idea that the dancer and ballet master Leon Espinosa was apparently captured by Indians in 1850 during a tour of north America, nor that the egocentric dancer Louis Duport so incensed the Parisian authorities with his demands that he allegedly escaped their wrath by slipping out of the city disguised as a woman in the company of a former mistress of Napoleon. But these tales will have to wait for another book </p> <p>\u0095 The Oxford Dictionary of Dance is published today, price \u00a325.</p>",
  "The government's controversial plans to sell off Britain's air traffic control service were close to collapse last night amid pressure from the House of Lords and the mounting chaos on the privatised railways. <p>Ministers were preparing for a defeat at the hands of an alliance between the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives, who hope to set up a public trust to run the service, when the delayed transport bill is debated in the Lords today. </p> <p>The government's official view is that it will not back down from the \u00a3500m partial privatisation of the service and that it is ready to send the issue back to the Lords until it gets its way. </p> <p>But this tactic could delay other legislation. Concerns are already being expressed that the government's plans to tighten up control of the railways and the introduction of congestion charging would be jeopardised by political posturing on air traffic control. </p> <p>The Department of Transport has prepared contingency plans to drop the air traffic sell-off from the Transport bill. </p> <p>In a further development yesterday, the department confirmed that the four bidders for the air traffic control privatisation hold possible conflicts of interest. It said that each bidder would have to show how they intended to meet this concern. They are all being closely examined by the government. </p> <p>There are also fears that the creation of a public-private partnership could lead to a further sale of air traffic control to individual airport operators. </p> <p>The proposed sell-off has been plagued with difficulties. Political pressure to drop the plans has been dramatically heightened by the collapse of the rail industry in the past week and an admission by Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's chief executive, that privatisation has led to fragmentation and a less safe railway. </p> <p>Leaders of the air traffic controllers' union (IPMS), said yesterday the government's plans to sell off the service could repeat some of the faults of previous privatisations. </p> <p>Paul Noon, the controllers' leader, said: \"After all we have learnt in the recent days, it is nothing short of incredible that the government should choose this moment to privatise air traffic control. </p> <p>\"The service provided by Nats [National Air Traffic Services] is the safest and most successful of any form of transport in the country. It is a model for the railways and we should thank God for its existence. But it could be wrecked by this dangerous experiment.\" </p> <p>Mr Noon said the government claimed the sell-off would enable Nats to invest in equipment, but that could not be guaranteed. \"Experience of Railtrack has shown that you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink.\"</p>",

  "<p>AT&amp;T, America's largest telecommunications company, yesterday announced a radical restructuring plan designed to improve its flagging share price and allow it to compete more effectively in fast-growing markets. </p> <p>The most significant restructuring of the former monopoly since the US government forced it to break itself up in 1984 did not manage to impress shareholders. Shares in the group fell 13% after the announcement that it would be split into four divisions - wireless, broadband, business and long-distance consumers services.</p> <p>Several analysts issued downgrades prompted by fears that revenues would continue to fall as the reorganisation, expected to take at least two years, caused turmoil.</p> <p>In a note to investors explaining his decision to downgrade the company yesterday, Adam Quinton, analyst at Merrill Lynch, wrote: \"In our view, the market will be troubled by the revenue trends at AT&amp;T.\"</p> <p>The company reported worse-than-expected third-quarter earnings yesterday and warned that the current quarter would also disappoint because of the performance of AT&amp;T's consumer and business divisions.

Shareholders have criticised the company for failing to address the problem of the increasingly competitive market for long-distance residential calls in America.</p> <p>At the same time, questions have been raised about whether Mr Armstrong's plan to create a telecommunications powerhouse would prevent the wireless and broadband divisions from growing as fast as they could.</p> <p>AT&amp;T has spent more than $100bn buying between 20 and 30 companies in the cable and broadband sectors since Mr Armstrong took control of the business in 1997.</p> <p>Yesterday he denied that the four-way split represented a strategic about-turn after publicly resisting pressure to split for several months. \"Our strategy has been consistent since we started this journey in 1998,\" he said.</p> <p>In 1997, AT&amp;T's growth businesses, such as wireless, accounted for only about 20% of group revenues, compared to 50% this year, Mr Armstrong said.</p> <p>AT&amp;T announced its acquisition of cable group Media One almost two years ago, a deal which made it the largest cable provider in the US and boosted its ability to supply broadband internet access to consumers and business customers.

  "The mood was electric in Zimbabwe's packed parliament when the opposition began impeachment proceedings yesterday against President Robert Mugabe, further eroding his political authority. <p>The articles of impeachment were delivered by Gibson Sibanda, vice-president of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), to the Speaker, Emmerson Mnangagwa. More than a third of the MPs had signed them. </p> <p>The 57 MDC members cried \"Yes, yes, today is the day!\" and the 92 members of Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF shouted \"Shame! This is nonsense. A waste of time!\" </p> <p>The impeachment has scant chance of gaining the necessary two-thirds majority, but it will focus attention on Mr Mugabe's record, including his disastrous management of the economy and his incitement of political violence. </p> <p>It is the first time impeachment has been used in Africa against a head of state. </p> <p>\"It shows that the MDC is doing everything it can in parliament and using the law to bring an end to the rule of a dictator,\" one of the party's MPs, Job Sikhala, said. </p> <p>The information minister, Jonathan Moyo, said: \"The MDC has been watching too much television and think they can act like the US Congress did against Bill Clinton. It is pure fantasy to think the president can be impeached. These people are just dreaming of Rhodesia. President Mugabe will not pay any attention to such frivolity.\" </p> <p>A Gallup poll yesterday showed that Mr Mugabe's popularity has plummeted in recent months: 74% of Zimbabweans wanted him to leave office and 51% said he should be put on trial. </p> <p>It showed a collapse of support in the rural areas which were his stronghold until a few months ago. </p> <p>His economic mismanagement, land seizures, violence against the opposition, involvement in the Congo war and rhetoric against whites were rejected by more than 70% of those interviewed in both urban and rural areas. </p> <p>Mr Mugabe responded by hardening his attack on whites, saying he would revoke the policy of racial reconciliation and put the former Rhodesian leader Ian Smith on trial for crimes against humanity during the 1970s war for majority rule. </p> <p>He addressed a band of about 400 supporters, who then marched through Harare and surrounded the House of Assembly, carrying printed placards which declared: \"Impeach the Chief Justice, not our President\", and \"Dissolve Parliament\". </p> <p>They were able to get to the front door of the parliamentary chamber without police hindrance, although similar gatherings of MDC supporters are quickly tear-gassed, beaten and arrested. </p> <p>The impeachment document charges Mr Mugabe with \"willful violation of the constitution\" and \"gross misconduct\". </p> <p>Many MDC supporters want mass action against Mr Mugabe but the party leaders fear that would lead to massacres.</p>",
  "In baseball, unlike politics, Americans know where they stand. The baseball World Series, which this year reduces \"world\" to the city of New York, engages every New Yorker with an intensity Al Gore and George W Bush can never match. Ideally the climactic contest would be between west and east coasts, Seattle Mariners v New York Mets. But the Mets v the Yankees is good enough. Baseball is war by other means even at one o'clock in the morning, when I watched the first game stretch into the 12th inning with 55,000 fans at Yankee Stadium screaming and roaring as though morning would never come. <p>Baseball is also the only team game ever invented that has no time limit. There can never be a tie. It goes on until there's a zero-sum result - unlike the election, which must end on November 7 and could produce any one of eight results. Gore could be president, with an all-Republican Congress, an all-Democrat Congress, a Congress split between Democratic House and Republican Senate, or just possibly vice versa. Bush faces the same permutations. Though some outcomes are more likely than others, none can be ruled out. Entering its own final stretch, the contest is too close to call. It's also, however, as unlike war as politics can ever be. Whole armies have not engaged. To the combatants it is everything. But many voters confess to the bewildered paralysis of people who think it doesn't matter. </p> <p>It began as a battle that did matter. Gore's convention speech promised a stark left-right election. There are still traces of that, in some clear differences over social security spending and tax cuts. While one man denounces big government, the other promises active government. But the blurring is intense. Bush, after all, would have to come to Washington and abandon his puerile pretence that the infamous city can be written out of the script. Gore is now insisting he wouldn't appoint a single extra federal employee. The centre beckons, and the politics of maximum inoffensiveness in search of elusive voters who can't yet persuade themselves the journey to the polling-booth is worth making. </p> <p>Trivia, therefore, reigns. This is less a political battle than a beauty contest. Who has the cuter smile? Which looks you more warmly in the eye? Which is the more likeable ? Never mind the competence, let alone the healthcare details - who would you rather have at the barbecue cook-out? Because from likeability comes trust , does it not? And from trust, the reassurance that this guy will do the right thing, whatever that might be. The verdict on the three Gore-Bush debates was that because Gore was superior in every sense, he had lost them, and maybe the election too. </p> <p>Why have things come to this? Three groups collude to produce it. First, the electorate, and its crisis of contentment. For many tens of millions of Americans, including the majority of the 50% likely to vote, there are no agonising existential choices. They think they don't have to confront anything serious that public men can do much about. They are having a good time. Smiles and body-language are attractions they can therefore indulge. Why not give the other side a chance? There can't be much to lose. </p> <p>Second, the candidates themselves, two dynastic dilutees. The juice is running out of the line. Gore is the son of a father who was a political hero of his time, a Tennessee senator of convictions, about Vietnam especially, which he would not surrender. Bush is the son of a president who was schooled for the highest office as well as any man who held it. Both current incumbents of the names are, by comparison, cyphers: calculating, unheroic, uninspired and, in Bush's case, the empty vessel into which Big Oil and the National Rifle Association have poured enough to guarantee they hold the public interest to ransom if they get the right result. </p> <p>Third, there are people like me, the commentators in thrall to the reality they see, amplifiers of this trivia, submitters to a zeitgeist they can't escape, compulsive expounders of the thesis that smiles matter, hauteur is deplorable, earnestness an anachronism, policy competence a burden. They may not like this. They compare it with better days, like Nixon/Kennedy or even Carter/Reagan. But they become part of the static that legitimises it. Because every poll says that likeable matters most, every writer has to say that George W Bush is proving an extraordinarily strong candidate for president and commander-in-chief of the US. </p> <p>The big loser from this tendency is, of course, Al Gore. He doesn't meet the new tests of showbiz politics, yet has so far failed to wrest the election back to the agendas that once counted for everything. This will mark an astounding historic record, if Gore loses. There will never have been a failure like it. </p> <p>Having been party to creating the contentment, Gore is unable to own it. The economic triumphs of Bill Clinton become an albatross round his neck. The test that used to be decisive - are most Americans better off after eight years of the incumbent party? - no longer figures. It is not only the times that have imposed this degeneration. It is the candidate, who has not imposed the terms of political trade he inherited, and has thus fortified the delusion that the result matters less than the outcome of the World Series. </p> <p>Whichever of the eight results happens in two weeks' time, it will matter hugely. If Bush becomes president, however close the call, America will have voted for change. That's how it will be seen. A new era will begin to get its name. After Clinton, Bush. It may come down to only a couple of precincts in Chicago, the ones they always said Kennedy stole to beat Nixon, but the name on the trophy will be definitive. </p> <p>It will bring a lot of consequences. Not just a style and a name and a fearsome collection of interest-groups awaiting their reward for the costliest campaign in history, but, actually, an ideology which, at the edge, favours the rich over the poor, the gunmen over the unarmed, the law of the jungle over the laws of men, and a supreme court that will make such biases come to pass. In foreign affairs, as I wrote on Tuesday, the change of trajectory is set to be much sharper. </p> <p>Can America, sleepwalking agreeably towards this, be made to care? In a tight race, for the remains of an apolitical electorate, much can still happen to change a few minds. In the land of trivia, the most trivial error could swing it. Bush is more capable than Gore of saying something stupid that makes fickle minds think again about the guy around the barbecue. Nothing, though, will match the ball game, to which I will tonight repair for a glimpse of the old testosterone. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",
  "Railtrack's sudden imposition of track closures and speed limits across the country conjures up the doomsday image of vital parts of the nation's infrastructure crumbling away after decades of underinvestment. Passengers are understandably irate when they receive only a couple of hours notice of track closures because of possible risks which must have been known to Railtrack for some considerable time. <p>If there is a risk to passenger safety, then Railtrack is, of course, justified in declaring force majeure. But this does not explain why the track was allowed to get into such a state in the first place, during a period when the company was making enough profits to see its share price surge on the stock market. It would be absurd to blame privatisation for the lack of a modern network of tracks, because successive governments denied the railways the continuous investment needed to modernise. Even if the railways were still in public ownership, lack of investment would almost certainly still be a problem. </p> <p>But privatisation is now almost five years old and, instead of getting better, the railways are patently getting worse - as commuters are rudely reminded every day. Railtrack and the operating companies frequently remind us of their grandiose plans for the future, usually extended over 10 or even 20 years to make them sound even grander. But nothing is seen to happen on the ground. </p> <p>What is on trial now is privatisation itself, as applied to a public service for which people rightly demand much higher standards of safety than they do when they make individual decisions to drive their own cars on roads. Railtrack may be suffering from a systemic design fault - maybe it is not possible for it to generate the profits (and dividends) necessary to keep shareholders happy while at the same time spending the vast sums which are needed to make the railways ultra-safe. </p> <p>Until this problem is resolved, the government would be extremely unwise to push ahead with the privatisation of air traffic control (due to be debated in the Lords today) or privatisation of London Transport in its present form. This is not an issue of dogma or party politics. It is a question of finding the right structure to deliver an efficient, safe and well-funded railway system of the kind that other countries take for granted. We are even further away from that goal than we were before privatisation.</p>",
  "<p>AT&amp;T and British Telecom insisted yesterday they are still trying to work together to improve joint services to corporate clients. </p> <p>The announcement that AT&amp;T intends to spin off its business services division has clouded the future of Concert, the joint venture between the British and US telecoms groups targeted at multinational corporations. </p> <p>US executives have voiced their disappointment at the performance of what should be a lucrative business. To improve the situation both sides are understood to have entered negotiations about merging their business service operations. These talks were understood to have broken down without agreement, however, as AT&amp;T prepared its restructuring efforts. </p> <p>But Michael Armstrong, head of AT&amp;T, refused to rule anything out yesterday when he said the company was still considering \"a lot of options\" to improve its services. Discussions with BT had been held for \"a short period of time\" and were therefore not over. </p> <p>At a press conference to discuss the demerger, he said: \"We think there are better ways to strengthen the construct that we currently have called Concert.\" </p> <p>Analysts have suggested that the uncertainty could end in a split rather than a merger. </p> <p>BT also yesterday insisted, however, that the AT&amp;T announcement did not mark the end of discussions. </p> <p>Analysts and shareholders said that AT&amp;T's announcement turned the spotlight on BT to clarify its strategy as well as its international relationships. </p> <p>Adam Quinton, telecoms analyst at Merrill Lynch, described AT&amp;T's plan as \"strategically, a nightmare for BT\" because of its possible impact on the joint venture and deeper questions it raises. </p> <p>\"A lot of people are going to be saying: the company that looks most like you in the world has just done this, what are you going to do?\" </p> <p>Shares in BT have fallen sharply in recent months as shareholders have grown disillusioned with the company's direction.

  "The shadowy world of British private investigators are a far cry from the Champagne-filled lifestyle of TV detective Magnum PI. <p>Instead, British private eyes are far more likely to be monitoring an errant husband through the telephoto lens of a camera to provide a suspicious wife with proof that her husband is having an affair. </p> <p>The bulk of assignments involve corporate surveillance, such as monitoring an employee who is claiming long-term sick leave. Pre-employment screening is another popular area, where a little delving can reveal the truth about that glowing reference. </p> <p>Timothy Jones, managing director of UK Private Investigators, said the perception of the unshaven, private detective in a dirty mac is a cliche. </p> <p>\"The men and women who work in this industry are highly skilled, often with a background in the police, armed forces or intelligence services,\" he said. \"They have to be able to blend in with any surroundings, whether it is a top class hotel or a rundown housing estate.\" </p> <p>Overseas work is also commonplace, with the bulk of assignments coming from companies wanting staff monitored for unsavoury extracurricular activities, said Mr Jones. </p> <p>\"We had one large company in Dubai that was appointing one of its employees to a senior position,\" he said. \"They were worried about the fact that he made so many trips to Thailand and asked us to follow him to see that he wasn't indulging in anything that might being the company into disrepute.\" </p> <p>One country he is adamant they would not visit on assignment is Cuba, on the grounds that it is too dangerous. He said: \"I doubt whether you would find many British private investigators' firms that would be keen. It's way too risky, given the political set-up and trade sanctions. </p> <p>\"While it is not unusual to send a team of six private detectives on a case, it is unusual - even amateurish - for investigators to be offered\u00a31,000 up front with more, depending on results.\" </p> <p>John Stalker, the former deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester, and now a security consultant agrees.

  "There is something about that raddled old tart of a quality, style, that gives it perpetual currency for women. That makes it a constantly covetable notion. It is, apart from anything else, a characteristic women applaud in other women. While overt sexiness has a subtext of confusing politics (empowering or exploiting? dangerous or endangering? subversive or compliant?), style is widely considered legit. To be stylish is to play by the rules. It is an all-round good thing. Therefore to have style is to be a superior woman. <p>But what exactly is style? In the name of making things a bit easier for us, last spring Vogue commissioned a style poll. Its results, the magazine hoped, would deconstruct the essence of modern style. But, as tends to be the case with these things, the Vogue Style Survey 2001 ended up saying more about its respondents than it did about the status of style in contemporary times. </p> <p>The results, which seeped into the public domain yesterday, revealed that the 2,000-plus respondents considered model-turned-actress Isabella Rossellini to be the definitive style icon of the moment, followed closely by Joanna Lumley. Some may interpret this as a clear indication that style is the unique preserve of the \"experienced\" woman. Indeed, a speed-read of the Vogue report reveals that 87% of the respondents consider the confidence acquired with time to be the major contributing factor of style, while 1% believe it to be a youth thing. </p> <p>In my experience, women aspire towards celebrity super beings who somehow resemble their non-famous selves in the smallest way. Our fantasy alter egos must always be anchored, however minimally, in a sense of the achievable. We need to be able to think: \"If I had her money and wardrobe and access to a personal trainer, and if I squinted a bit when I looked in the mirror, then just maybe . . . \" </p> <p>Thus brunette normal beings will not waste their time wishing they could be Cameron Diaz and, equally, those surveyed by Vogue were presumably not about to start holding up Britney Spears as a style icon, in the knowledge that they passed their sell-by date on that look some time before. The fact that they (somewhat confusingly) then voted overwhelmingly for Jennifer Aniston as Personal Style Icon (as opposed to Most Stylish) speaks volumes about precisely that: Aniston's look, though admittedly developed from sound basic material, is nonetheless a testament to the possibilities of an everyday aesthetic improved by serious grooming. </p> <p>Quite apart from that, Vogue's top 10 stylish women list is a strange combination of fairly random names. Catherine Zeta Jones is at three, with a style ethic (buxom Welsh strumpet?) that seems essentially to rely on a never-ending supply of diamond-encrusted premiere dresses and some studied hair flickery. Jennifer Aniston crashes in at four, with her take on Hollywood smart casual (faded denim, glitzy tops, slut heels and ironed flat hair) and Elizabeth Hurley makes it to five, thanks to her neat line in gratuitous glitzy slapper chic, which, when juxtaposed with her faux aristo public persona, creates a heady sexiness - but does it really qualify as style incarnate? </p> <p>More confusing yet, precisely what style qualities does Aniston share with Gwyneth Paltrow, who makes it in at number seven (jointly with Nicole Kidman) and whose particular breed of pared-down Calvin Klein minimalism and power grooming bears out the belief, shared by 45% of poll respondents, that Audrey Hepburnesque simplicity defines style. Yet Madonna, who sashays in at number six, has done nothing but be extremely un-simple and inconsistent in her aesthetic reinventions, from geisha girl to retro boho trollop and back again in the past two years. </p> <p>It's all terribly confusing, really. Particularly when you consider that, given the current ubiquitousness of the celebrity stylist, famous women are arguably the outward expression of someone else's style. And how often are celebrity women PR-spun stylish public personas? Do we really think Joanna Lumley is stylish, or are we just buying the English cut-glass hauteur associated with her fame? </p> <p>According to hackneyed clich\u00e9, style is a nebulous quality - \"more than just about clothes\", in the words of Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman. But surely there must be some logic behind the possessing of it. By considering the enduring, archetypally stylish women of the last century - Audrey Hepburn, Rita Hayworth, Lauren Bacall - then extracting the common denominators, it is possible to bash out a prototype of sorts. </p> <p> Cheekbones are good, but too-full lips will count against you. If you happen to be blonde, your skin must be perma-pale - neither tans nor blushes will do. And if you're brunette, do as power New Yorkers Plum Sykes and her cronies do, and depilate. Exhaustively. A louche demeanour, poised walk and sleek finish are essential, and lack of cleavage is an advantage - as we've already seen, blatant sexuality and innate stylishness rarely coexist. </p> <p>The stylish are people of few words. They can generally express themselves sufficiently merely by manipulating one fiercely shaped eyebrow. Emotional outbursts do not become them. Sudden movements of any kind, in fact, do not work for the stylish. Unless, perhaps, we are talking about performing a perfectly executed tango. </p> <p>To be truly stylish, you must also be thin. Thinness is always good. It mutters about formidable self-control and the kind of austere personality that wears style best. The stylish often smoke, which is a double whammy of a stylish trait because beyond looking cool (which it does), smoking can help with the thinness. </p> <p>Style, I am widely informed, is about having \"class\" - which in theory has little to do with social class but in practice often does because the kind of affluence that allows you to bunk off the day job and get groomed will certainly help, if not actually guarantee you stylish status. Lady Helen Taylor, who is currently gracing the front of Hello!, alongside the coverline, \"A Perfect Ambassador For Style\", would probably tell you as much.</p>",
  "<p>The City has been volunteered by the chancellor for a health check by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to see if it poses a risk to global financial stability. </p> <p>Mr Brown announced the move yesterday in an attempt to spur other countries into taking part in the so-called financial sector assessment programme (FSAP), which is designed to prevent a repeat of the Asian crisis. </p> <p>Weaknesses in the financial systems of countries such as South Korea and Thailand have been widely blamed for contributing to the panic which spread through the global financial system after the devaluation of the Thai bhat in August 1997. </p> <p>\"I am confident that UK financial regulation is amongst the best in the world,\" said Mr Brown, attending a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Montreal. </p> <p>\"Nevertheless, the UK financial sector is also amongst the most important in the global financial system.

  "<p>A bitterly satirical portrait of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher is back in Britain for the first time since it provoked uproar in an exhibtion at the Tate by lampooning art collector Charles Saatchi and his close connection with the gallery. </p> <p>Mr Saatchi, famous for buying the complete contents of studios of artists he likes, chose not to add this one to his collection. Since 1984 it has been in a private collection in the United States, and has come back on temporary loan to the Painting the Century exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery, which opens today. </p> <p>The painting by the German artist Hans Haacke was the star exhibit in his one man show in the Tate in 1984, and poured petrol on an already blazing arts row. </p> <p>Charles and his twin brother Maurice are portrayed in the cracked plates on the top shelf of the book case. The painting pillories the Iron Lady's assault on cultural institutions, and the Saatchi and Saatchi advertising campaigns credited with winning her elections in 1979 and 1983 - the books on the shelves carry the names of Saatchi and Saatchi accounts. </p> <p>But it also specifically refers to a furious row over the Tate's closeness to Charles. He was a member of its patrons of new art committee, and it emerged that he owned almost all the paintings in two exhibitions the committee organised. The paintings were by Jennifer Bartlett, who had been commissioned to design Saatchi's dining room, and New York artist Julian Schnabel. The exhibitions were seen as boosting sale prices. The paper on the table refers to sales from the Saatchi collection. </p> <p>As a result of the row, the Saatchis broke their connection with the Tate and opened their own gallery of contemporary art in 1985. </p> <p>Yesterday Robin Gibson, curator of the National Portrait Gallery exhibition, said: \"The irony is that 16 years later Charles Saatchi is acknowledged to be one of the strongest forces in the contemporary art market in Britain, and the painting looks increasingly like one of the most memorable images of Margaret Thatcher ever produced.\" </p> <p>Mr Gibson has chosen one painting to represent each year from 1900 to 2000, beginning with a monumentally glum Queen Victoria. </p> <p>The portraits include many of the most celebrated images of the century, including Andy Warhol's double portrait of a gun toting Elvis Presley.</p>",
  "As the organiser of the conference looking at the implications of growing numbers of students resident within the community, it was interesting to compare your article (Two square miles of housing hell, October 24), regurgitating the well-known views of Harold Best MP, with Anne Power's excellent article (City Limits, Society, October 25). The real issues in Headingley fit into the wider picture of inner-city urban depopulation. The only difference with other inner-city areas is that young people actually want to live there. What is more, housing standards are not poor and investment, mainly by the private sector, has been substantial. Over 80% of owners in Headingley meet, voluntarily, a code of standards, which reflects their long-term commitment to the area. <p> Of course rapid social change needs managing. The universities in Leeds, the local authority, the charity sector and local community groups are all making efforts to tackle problems of crime and security, waste disposal and tolerance of different lifestyle issues. Tomorrow's conference is about sharing examples of best practice. </p> <p>Those who are critical of young people living in the inner city represent the same policy-makers who have seen our urban core decline over the last 20 years and who have no alternative solutions. <br><b>Martin Blakey</b><br> Unipol Student Homes  <a href=\"mailto:M.J.Blakey@unipol.leeds.ac.uk\">M.J.Blakey@unipol.leeds.ac.uk</a> </p> <p>\u0095 Both Leeds University and Leeds Metropolitan University were a benign influence in the past, converting large old houses, too big for modern families, to residences and maintaining swathes of open space as playing fields. Now landlordism is biting into established family areas and the results are the kind of squalor seen in your photograph. The idea that students are a \"regenenerative\" influence would strike most local residents as a sick joke - there is not one greengrocer now in Headingley, for instance, though take-aways, pubs and cheap cafes are thick on the ground. </p> <p>The blame lies with the manic pursuit by government of ever-rising student numbers. A real campaign of regeneration would see new student housing developed in south and east Leeds. The universities have a responsibility to develop housing to contain the young people they impose on the city. Nottingham's new inner-city campus demonstrates how positive an influence universities can be in regenerating cities. <br><b> Kenneth Powell</b><br> London </p> <p>\u0095 Your article struck a chord with those of us living in Dunkirk and Lenton, Nottingham. Next year Nottingham council has set itself a target of 220 houses in the whole of the city to be inspected and registered as \"shared houses\" and houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) - fewer than five a week and some indication of the low priority given to tackling a problem which threatens to destroy the inner-city community in which I live. </p> <p>Before universities are allowed to expand further, they should be made to provide suitable student accommodation on their own land and local councils should be given the power to control the numbers of HMOs in any one street (say 25%). More importantly, local councils should require the same standards of provision, in terms of quality, management and fire safety, from private landlords as they expect of housing associations. </p> <p>We want to live in a vibrant, multicultural community: the way Dunkirk and Lenton used to be. The prospect of this diminishes every day.

  "<p>The consolidation and shake-up of ITV continued yesterday as Carlton Communications picked up the contract to handle Scottish Media Group's \u00a3120m-a-year television advertising sales. </p> <p>The company's subsidiary, Carlton Sales, will take over selling airtime for SMG's Scottish and Grampian ITV subsidiaries on January 1 as part of a five-year deal. </p> <p>The agreement gives Carlton control of ITV's advertising revenue and means it will be responsible for almost \u00a31bn of annual advertising income. </p> <p>Carlton will take over from TSMS the sale of Scottish and Grampian airtime. TSMS is the former United News &amp; Media sales house that is being merged with Granada Sales following the \u00a31.75m sale of United's ITV businesses to Granada Media. </p> <p>The merger and loss of the SMG contract will lead to 100 job losses at the combined TV sales house, Granada confirmed yesterday. </p> <p>SMG was able to renegotiate its TV sales business under office of fair trading rules laid down before the alliance between Granada and United. </p> <p>In order to get the merger cleared by regulators, Granada gave an undertaking that it would free the smaller ITV franchises from their existing TSMS airtime sales contracts. </p> <p>TSMS had been handling the Scottish and Grampian accounts since 1994 and the existing deal was due to run until the end of 2002. </p> <p>Donald Emslie, SMG's managing director, said that the company held \"thorough and extensive discussions\" with both Carlton Sales and Granada Sales before awarding the sales contract to the former. </p> <p>\"We went with Carlton because of the deal that they offered in commercial terms and the services they could provide,\" he added. </p> <p>He continued: \"This is good news for ITV and advertisers, creating a balance in the market place between two equally strong sales houses.\" </p> <p>SMG's total TV advertising revenues in 1999, the last full year reported, were just under \u00a3120m, with Scottish and Grampian accounting for 6.1% of ITV's net advertising revenue in that year. </p> <p>Carlton Sales managing director Steve Platt said: \"Adding the Scottish stations to the Carlton stable gives us a stronger sell with a wider reach. HTV and the Scottish stations together bring an other 9m people into the Carlton sell.\" </p> <p>The cuts in the combined Granada Media airtime sales arm will be made by January, with some staff being asked to reapply for their jobs. </p> <p>Granada took over ownership of TSMS on October 4. Staff from TSMS will be moved from the company's west London base in Hanger Lane to Granada's headquarters in Grays Inn Road. </p> <p>Lorna Tilbian, analyst at WestLB Panmure, said she was unsurprised by yesterday's developments. </p> <p>A central thrust of SMG's strategy, she said, has been to maintain its independence from Granada Media, which sits on an 18% stake of the company. </p> <p>Granada Media caused a stir last year when SMG said it was interested in buying radio group Ginger Media. </p> <p>Yesterday's deal makes a merger of equals of Carlton and Granada Media more likely in two years' time when legislation allowing further consolidation in ITV is passed, Ms Tilbian said.</p>",
  "<p>Let's not mince words here. Companies routinely use City analysts to massage expectations of their performance. The most powerful analysts within particular sectors tend to have superior access to executives because companies want favourable coverage from the investment community. Analysts want preferential treatment because it gives them an edge which they can turn into profit through their investment clients. </p> <p>The same goes for newspapers. Journalists want scoops. Their \"profit\" is being ahead of the game - and if that means reining back on the objectivity front, well... </p> <p>One daily paper routinely tells corporate financiers and the like that a sizeable exclusive story will get prominence, an accompanying background feature and a piece of \"independent\" analysis. The so-called Friday night drop for Sunday newspapers, meanwhile, is well documented. </p> <p>The victims here are plain to see: investors who are late to receive price-sensitive information and those who are fooled by unprincipled journalism. The broad split is between City professionals who are plugged in and ordinary retail investors, who are not. </p> <p>Howard Davis, chairman of the City's principal watchdog, wants to blow the whistle on all this. He has noticed the Regulation FD rule on fair disclosure introduced on Wall Street this week, where companies are explicitly banned from releasing information selectively. He wants to remind everybody that selective leaking is already illegal here, and that a crackdown is on its way. </p> <p>Mr Davis and his regulatory army are in a growth industry. Incidents of media manipulation, selective City briefings and blatant insider dealing are for them a daily occurrence. </p> <p>But there are costs in tackling this. Messing with the established flow of information tends to create information \"shocks\", such as profit warnings, which draw knee-jerk reactions in the markets and destabilise companies and their staff. There is also the danger of spending huge amounts of money trying to fix the unfixable. For City professionals the market is their job; for most retail investors the market is a hobby. The average low bet punter will never be in the same loop as someone sitting in the middle of a dealing room. </p> <p>Mr Davies might remember the old central heating system analogy when it comes to information flows. The City's pipes are a bit too full of water, but so long as the pressure release valves are easily located and in good order, the system works. If you start capping these valves the leaks will simply appear in the places you least expect. </p> <p>One or two might even appear in these pages. </p> <p><strong> Losec's lost lead </strong><br> </p> <p> Lying in bed at night, AstraZeneca chief executive Tom McKillop must sometimes ponder whether life would have been easier if the company had never invented Losec - the ulcer treatment which has become the world's top selling prescription drug. </p> <p>Conceived in one of Astra's Gothenburg laboratories in the early 1970s, the product ranks alongside Ikea sofas, Abba and Arsenal winger Freddie Ljungberg as one of Sweden's greatest contributions to modern civilisation. </p> <p>The drug has been phenomenally successful but as it nears the end of its life, Mr McKillop has to spend much of his time tramping around the City insisting there is more to the company than curing tummy aches. </p> <p>His argument appears thinner than ever after yesterday's events. A shortfall of between $200m (\u00a3138m) and $300m has emerged in American sales of Losec and, although profits will still meet forecasts, the company's market value fell \u00a31.5bn on the news. </p> <p>Any wobble from Losec causes another crack in analysts' fragile confidence in Nexium - the group's follow-up product. Nexium is at best a marginal improvement, and AstraZeneca will have a hard job persuading doctors to choose it instead of cheap, generic copies of Losec. </p> <p>The most worrying aspect of yesterday's setback is that AstraZeneca seems to have been completely foxed by its competitors, who surprised the company simply by slashing the price of their rival drugs. AstraZeneca failed to anticipate such moves and has been unable to respond effectively. This does not bode well for the Anglo-Swedish firm's chances of managing the delicate introduction of Nexium in the US. </p> <p>To make matters worse for Mr McKillop, the European commission is still investigating whether the company has been \"abusing its dominant position\", and the finest legal minds of the world are struggling to persuade judges that the company's patent protection on Losec should be extended. </p> <p>Although the company has a very promising heart drug in late stage clinical trials, its immediate future looks about as steady as a flatpack blonde wood wardrobe.</p>",
  "Al Gore may be coming back. Down just a few days ago by 5-7 points in most US polls, he shows signs of surging back into contention, narrowing the Bush lead to three points or less in three national polls and tied dead even in three others. <p>Gore, relentlessly aggressive, is savaging Bush's record as Texas governor every night in television ads in all swing states while the Republican candidate runs soft ads about his commitment to better education. Capitalising on Bush's overconfidence, the Democrat is making this a close race again. </p> <p>George W. Bush has a tendency to take his victory lap too early. Too soon, he amasses a lead and starts to jog around the track expecting the cheers of the crowd. Over-confidence gripped him before and during the Republican convention. </p> <p>He chose Richard Cheney as his running mate during this period, when it seemed that he could choose anyone and keep his lead. Instead, Gore used his selection of the first Jewish candidate, Joe Lieberman, as his vice-president to begin to catch up and surge in front. </p> <p>Now, buoyed by a good performance in the presidential debates he was supposed to lose, Bush seems to be letting up too early, switching to soft media at the time he needs to turn it up a notch to stay ahead of the surging Democrat. While Gore relentlessly pounds on Bush's shortcomings in Texas, the Republican seems to be too complacent and laid back. </p> <p>Gore may well have latched on to the issue that he can use to eat up the Bush lead: Medicare. Since Bush proposes to take the money Gore would spend shoring up the system that provides health care to the elderly and use it for a tax cut, the Republican is highly vulnerable to Democratic attack on the issue. </p> <p>It is axiomatic that, in a political contest, you should use your advertising to attack the opponent and let your candidate stay on the high road. During the debates Gore led the attack, slashing away at Bush. He seemed obnoxious, overbearing, and boorish. </p> <p>The election now boils down to an exchange of advertisements. In the ads Gore can make the points he failed to make in the debates. So what if voters don't like the announcer who delivers the message? The candidate can keep his hands clean while the advertisement guts his opponent. Gore, who failed to win the debates, may be winning the post-debate advertising. </p> <p>In the opinion of many the contest is between a candidate who isn't up to it (Bush) and a candidate who doesn't get it (Gore). In my own opinion, it is between two good men, either of whom would be a fine president. In any case, the similarity of the candidates - each trying to hug the centre - makes it a very volatile race, with the lead seeming to change hands every few weeks. </p> <p>The volatility, in part, stems from a virtual consensus among American voters. The vast majority feel that Bush is the better person but they agree more with Gore on the issues. They admire Bush's character, integrity, and persona more than they do Gore's. </p> <p>They report that Bush is more \"likable\" than Gore but tend to see Gore as the better person to address such American needs as social security reform, Medicare, gun control, education, and the environment. </p> <p>With this kind of split in the minds of most voters, a lead of a few points is most unstable. For all practical purposes, this race is tied and is likely to remain so until the bitter end. This contest is shaping up as one of the closest in US history. And the most exciting. </p> <p>\u0095 Dick Morris was chief strategist for Bill Clinton in his 1996 re-election campaign.

  "<p>Labour's Andrew Smith is a man of few words. However one phrase that may come back to haunt the government was uttered to party conference delegates before the last election. </p> <p>Mr Smith was then the party's transport spokesman and his rousing speech attacked the Tories' plan to privatise Britain's air traffic control service, NATS. To cheers, Mr Smith proclaimed that \"our air was not for sale\". </p> <p>As a leading member of Gordon Brown's Treasury team, however, Mr Smith has been happy to see the government push through plans to sell off NATS. </p> <p>The Lords, perhaps mindful of Mr Smith's earlier boasts and worried over the proposed shake-up of the railways, are in a mood to block ministers' much vaunted Transport Bill - which would end the privatisation of NATS. </p> <p>What is worse is that transport officials are openly questioning whether the four bidders for NATS each posed \"conflicts of interest\". The Department of Transport said the prospective buyers for the \u00a3500m partial privatisation \"would have to show how they would meet this concern\". </p> <p>The department said that it had been holding meetings with the bidders and air traffic controllers to see how the issues could be resolved. </p> <p>The new privatised service is due to be set up by the middle of the year. At stake is a business which earned \u00a3568m last year from supplying air traffic services to airlines and 12 British airports. The four bidders are: </p> <p>&amp;#149 an airline group, including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and British Midland, who say they would operate on a non-profit basis to ensure that there is no threat to safety standards. Critics point out that if these carriers own NATS they could in theory charge rivals more to use air traffic services; </p> <p>\u0095 Lockheed Martin, which supplies the computer systems at Swanwick, the new air traffic control centre due to open in 2002. Computer glitches have delayed the opening for four years; </p> <p>\u0095 Raytheon, a US aerospace manufacturer, with little experience of operating air traffic control in Britain. If Raytheon's bid succeeds, it will have to consider replacing the Lockheed Martin technology at Swanwick with an unspecified new system. This could set back the opening of Swanwick by several years; </p> <p>\u0095 Nimbus, a consortium which includes Arinc, a big supplier of satellite technology to NATS. </p> <p>One of the stated aims of the proposed legislation is to split NATS from the Civil Aviation Authority by separating responsibility for safety from the service provider. But three of the bids would hand over control of NATS to one of its main equipment providers. </p> <p>Paul Noon, leader of the air traffic controllers' union, IPMS, said that all the bids being considered by the government either involved foreign state-owned providers or foreign companies. </p> <p>\"This destroys the argument that private sector status will enable NATS to become a world leader in overseas markets. Just the reverse will happen. They will eat us for breakfast.\"</p>",
  "During the Dieppe Raid in August 1942, Colonel Patrick \"Pat\" Porteous, who has died aged 82, was a captain with Lord Lovat's 4th Commando. Its crucial task was to attack a German six-gun battery located some five miles west of Dieppe near Varengeville, which could bring fire down on the main landing of the 2nd Canadian Division. <p>Lovat landed one small detachment on a narrow beach immediately below the gun battery and the remainder on a larger beach to the west, near Quiberville. The idea was to execute a wide flanking movement and attack the battery from the rear while it was pinned down by the other detachment attacking from the front. </p> <p>Porteous, acting as liaison officer between the two groups, was wounded through the hand and upper arm, but despatched his assailant with his bayonet - thus saving the life of a British sergeant the German was about to shoot. Lovat's main assault on the rear of the battery then took place, across 250 yards of open ground and through barbed wire defences around the gun pits. </p> <p>Under withering machine-gun fire Porteous dashed across the open ground, rallying the men who, inspired by his example, took the battery with a bayonet assault. Although wounded again, this time in the thigh, he directed the destruction of the guns before collapsing through loss of blood. The battery had been silenced, although at great cost. Porteous's VC was announced that October. </p> <p>The son of an Indian Army brigadier general, Porteous was born at Abbottabad on the North-west frontier. Educated at Wellington, where he excelled at rugby union, he entered the Royal Military Academy Woolwich and was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1937. He served with the British Expeditionary Force in France, was evacuated from Dunkirk and joined No 4 Commando in late 1940. Following Dieppe, he was second in command of No 4 Commando when it landed in Normandy on June 6 1944. </p> <p>Porteous's post-war career included service in Palestine, attendance at the Staff College, Camberley, followed by a period as a battery commander, and a posting in Germany. One of the most enjoyable jobs he had was as an instructor and company commander at Sandhurst. </p> <p>This was followed by a two-year posting to Singapore. After this he returned to regimental duties and from 1960-63 he spent a particularly happy posting as commander of the Junior Leaders' Regiment RA. </p> <p>Later appointments included three years on the general staff with the Directorate of Land/Air Warfare. Colonel Porteous's final posting was as commander of the Rheindahlen Garrison of the British Army of the Rhine, after which he retired from the army in 1970. </p> <p>As well as being a first class soldier, Pat Porteous was a modest and unassuming man blessed with a wry sense of humour. Devoted to his family, he loved gardening and, in his younger days, had been a keen sailor. In his retirement he gave a great deal of time and energy to supporting and raising money for the Commando Association and the Army Benevolent Fund. </p> <p>From 1993 he was vice chairman (UK) of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association. Together with fellow holders of these two supreme awards, he attended the Queen Mother's 100th birthday pageant on July 19. His death leaves 22 living holders of the VC. </p> <p>His first wife died in 1953. He is survived by his second wife, whom he married in 1955, and four daughters, one from his first marriage and three from his second. His son from his first marriage died in 1998.</p>",

A free CD is available to order from the site, with details on the awards and a guide to good web design, tutorials and more. </p> <p><strong> Barbie radio</strong><br> Catch the final prelaunch broadcast today of <a href=\"http://www.barbiefm.\">BarbieFM</a>, a net radio station aimed at three to nine year old girls and featuring young girls and a mother-daughter team as the show's presenters. As the name suggests, the station has the backing of Mattel but was the inspiration of a broadcaster who heard his young daughters doing a pretend radio programme with their Barbies. The show plans to focus on things young girls are interested in: apparently, sleepovers, pencil cases, animals, music, friendship, and of course, fashion and beauty. The station goes live next month. </p> <p><strong> Wap hunt</strong><br> Nokia and Excite have teamed to offer a Wap search engine, accessible either from <a href=\"http://www.nokia.com\">www.nokia.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.excite.co.uk.  \">www.excite.co.uk</a>. </p> <p><strong> Design Edge</strong><br> Six women have launched a new style and design site, <a href=\"http://www.definingedge.com\">Defining Edge</a>, which is a combination magazine and shopping zone. Along with articles on subjects such as lighting for the home, the site features a designer and resource directory. </p> <p><strong> Grass roots</strong><br> If you don't know how the institutions that serve you work, you can't influence them. That's the inspiration behind educational organisation Common Ground's new website: <a href=\"http://www.citizensconnection.net/\">www.citizensconnection.net</a> There is plenty of advice not just on how government and other systems work in the UK, but how to use them to go about changing things.

Of course, there's Al (\"Al Gore invented the internet, so he has an edge in the domination of The Arena\") and George (\"The Texecutioner has executed 140+ people by proxy, and was anxious to get his hands dirty in the arena\"). But why not blast away at Ralph Nader, Joe Lieberman, or Dick Cheney as well? </p> <p><strong> Antiques</strong><br> Antiques and collectibles enthusiasts should enjoy <a href=\"http://www.superantiques.com\">Superantiques</a>, which was already getting top ratings in its prelaunch phase. Now it is officially online, and functions as a sort of eBay for antiques and art. Accredited dealers give background information on items offered for sale and there's plenty of educational material as well for those interested in learning about collecting. The only problem is all the dealers are in Southern California. But then, shipping costs never seem to dissuade collectors. </p> <p><strong> New and noted</strong><br> \u0095 The Guinness Book of World Records has a new entertainment site at <a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/\">www.guinnessworldrecords.com</a>. </p> <p> \u0095 People who are the targets of cyber stalkers or mobile phone harassers can join a UK-centric discussion group at <a href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/Anticyberstalkinguk\">www.egroups.com/group/Anticyberstalkinguk</a>. </p> <p> \u0095 Link to the Land Registry and other property-oriented services at <a href=\"http://www.propertyspy.com\">www.propertyspy.com</a>. </p> <p> \u0095 Visit the surreal world of celebrities and non-celebrities at The World of Mr Gibson, <a href=\"http://www.mrgibson.net\">www.mrgibson.net</a>. </p> <p> \u0095 Comparison shop for gas, electricity or mobile phone services in the UK at <a href=\"http://www.uswitch.com\">www.uswitch.com</a>. </p> <p> <strong>Six of the best:</strong> Halloween </p> <p> <strong> Virtual haunted house </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.bonegarden.com\">www.bonegarden.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Ghoulish games and facts</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.spooky.org.uk/\">www.spooky.org.uk</a> </p> <p><strong>Vampire Lestat Fan Club </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.arvlfc.org/\">www.arvlfc.org</a> </p> <p><strong>Samhain lore </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.witchvox.com/holidays/samhain.html\">www.witchvox.com/holidays/samhain.html</a> </p> <p><strong> Pumpkin scratchcards </strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.tombola.co.uk\">www.tombola.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong>Bats, ghosts and more </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com  \">www.nationalgeographic.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The old man had never seen a computer up close before. As countless other first-time computer users had done before him, he picked up the mouse, pointed it at the monitor, and clicked. </p> <p>The hundred computer executives, researchers, and marketers who were watching him laughed out loud. Some of the well-dressed executives even turned red and got tears in their eyes. </p> <p>The poor old guy was approaching a new technology in the most natural way he knew how. But because he didn't conform to the machine's needs, he became the object of ridicule. </p> <p>I won't mention the name of the company where this horrific display took place, because it wasn't the first time I've seen people in the technology business make this same, stupid mistake. Their own insecurity and lack of knowledge about how computers work leads them to laugh at anyone who is even less new-media-literate than they are. It's a way of feeling experienced, and \"with it\". </p> <p>It's also a way of missing out on perhaps the only meaningful information one can derive from such \"user testing\" - namely, how people naturally respond to technologies and interfaces. </p> <p>Were any of the assembled researchers confident enough in their own relationship to technology to take notice, they would have marveled at their test subject's steadfast belief in the ability of the computer mouse to function like a television remote control. </p> <p>In fact, if a majority of people confronting a mouse for the first time really do attempt to use it in this fashion, might there not be an interface idea in there, somewhere? Is there any logic in developing, or at least testing, a mouse that points directly at the screen? No, let's not even consider that. We made the adjustment to mouse-thinking, so the old man must do so, too. It's part of the pain of initiation. </p> <p>I'm not arguing for a new kind of mouse, here, but a new way of understanding how to approach the interface between humans and their machines. It's not a matter of figuring out how to get people to conform to the technologies we've already developed. The people who succeed in the device-driven networking economy of the future will be those who create applications, interfaces, and designs that conform to human need and expectation. The businesses that continue to work on strategies for \"getting people to do this\", or \"figuring out how to make people do that\" will fail as surely as WebTV. </p> <p>The trick here is to put ourselves back onto the human side of the cybernetic equation. What does a person nat urally do with a device in a certain environment? What do people need in airports, for example, in their cars, at their desks, or in their living rooms? </p> <p>Rather than struggling to bring people to technology, figure out how to bring technology to people. Instead of turning the old man into a proper mouse-user, turn the mouse into a proper remote control! </p> <p>After all, the technology is supposed to be serving the people - not the other way around. </p> <p>Get it, businesspeople? You say you do, but I don't believe you - not given what's taking place on cell phones right now. Or on the world wide web, for that matter. Most companies in these spaces are ignoring the way in which people actually use these technologies. </p> <p>Consider something as simple as the size of devices - what we could call their \"scale\". More enlightened user-experience research companies like Creative Good here in New York <a href=\"http://www.creativegood.com\" target=\"_new\">www.creativegood.com</a> have broken down technologies into three major groups: inch devices, foot devices, and yard devices. Each scale of device has a most natural set of uses. </p> <p>An inch device, like a cell phone's Wap interface or a Palm device, is pretty much like a Post-It note. We use it to retrieve a note or record one that we'll use later. We hold it in one hand and enter text with another, and we use it in a public environment, for as short a time as possible. </p> <p>A foot device, like a computer, is where we work with the information we may have recorded on the inch device. It's where we'll actually manipulate our database of contacts, or write the article using the names of user-test ing companies we gathered on the Palm. Yard devices, like televisions and video projectors, are used to present or collaborate about this information with others. </p> <p> Obvious? So then why are wireless companies attempting to shrink the web, through Wap, onto tiny cell phone screens? Don't they know the web was designed for the foot-scaled computer screen, and not a two-line text-only inch device? </p> <p>Apparently not, which is why anyone who has tried to do what one might actually want to do through the internet on a cell phone - like check email or a stock quote - is suffering through dozens of keystrokes and nested screens rather than the simplicity of true inch-scale interfaces, such as those on Palm or Rim devices. </p> <p>It's the same sort of mistake that dozens of streaming media companies have made: believing that the computer screen is a proper place to watch feature length movies. They are mistakenly broadcasting yard-scale media through a foot device. That's why they're all going out of business. </p> <p>This is not rocket science. It's merely a subtle shift in how to think about making new media decisions. Bring your technology to the human being, and not the other way around.</p>",
  "<p>Tuvalu, Moldova, Lithuania, Monserrat, Ascension Island, St Helena, South Georgian and the Sandwich Islands_ What have these countries got in common? A terrific internet suffix. Two lower-case letters could be a cybergoldmine as businesses chase an eye-catching easy-to-remember address for e-commerce. </p> <p>In Tuvalu any registered internet domain name is followed by .tv - the perfect electronic calling-card for any television company. The quick-witted Tuvaluan government has sold its registration rights in a $30m deal. A nice little export earner for the tiny Pacific coral island republic that beats selling copra any day. It was lucky they changed the name from the Ellice Islands. </p> <p>Moldova, sandwiched between Russian and Romania, got a windfall from every doctor on the planet when it got the registration rights for .md. </p> <p>But my hopes rest on Lithuania. They landed .lt. Nothing special in its own right (except for London Transport). But .lt makes lots of appetizing words as electronic des res for sale or rent. I have registered <a href=\"http://www.heartfe.lt\">www.heartfe.lt</a> - ideal for any business which wants a romantic location. </p> <p>Education and training establishments should be fighting for my <a href=\"http://www.perfectresu.lt\">www.perfectresu.lt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bestresu.lt\">www.bestresu.lt.</a> A gym would profit from <a href=\"http://www.wellbui.lt\">www.wellbui.lt</a> and any business can seal bids for my <a href=\"http://www.consentingadu.lt,\">www.consentingadu.lt,</a> no questions asked. </p> <p>I expected many drams from the whisky industry for <a href=\"http://www.singlema.lt\">www.singlema.lt</a>, but when I offered it to the Scotch Whisky Association I got a frightfully stiff letter back from the chief executive, complaining that there was far too much of this sort of thing going on. This sort of thing is called originality and it could help to sell Scotch whisky in a very tough world marketplace. </p> <p>As the island of Montserrat battles to recover from the volcano, it should get some help from its suffix .ms. This should appeal to any feminist organisation, but my eye lit on <a href=\"http://www.grandsla.ms\">www.grandsla.ms</a> for a bridge club or a sporting business. </p> <p>It is simplicity itself to look for a likely domain name. There are hundreds of businesses online willing to check whether your choice is free. Vanity made me look up all the <a href=\"http://www.hellers.UK\">www.hellers.UK </a> The version (quite fairly) was registered by the Heller Machine Tool Campany of Redditch, Worcerstershire, and I wish them well with their horizontal centring range. </p> <p>But the US .com version has been snaffled for no good reason by John Mayes Aviation of Palo Alto, California, and if they do not give it back I shall never fly to Palo Alto again... </p> <p>Having checked the chosen name, the online companies will register it for you with the appropriate agency: it costs typically \u00a350 for an attractive overseas suffix and as little as \u00a310 for a boring old .uk.co. Once registered, the domain name is yours for a year, renewable. You can trade under it yourself or put it up for sale or auction online. </p> <p>My names are registered at <a href=\"http://www.register.com\">www.register.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.virtualnames.co.uk\">www.virtualnames.co.uk</a>. Information on registration procedures for many countries is available at <a href=\"http://www.safenames.com\">www.safenames.com</a>. </p> <p>Some phenomenal prices are sought for apparently desirable names. Someone wants $2.5m for www. onlinechecking.com (on sale by <a href=\"http://www.URLmerchant.com\">www.URLmerchant.com</a>). </p> <p>Any American lawyers could find $1m from petty cash for <a href=\"http://www.USlawyer.com\">www.USlawyer.com</a>, but <a href=\"http://www.ethically.com\">www.ethically.com</a> will cost only one eighth as much for any business self-righteous enough to use it. </p> <p>By comparison <a href=\"http://www.genuinebusinessdeals.com\">www.genuinebusinessdeals.com</a> looks a bargain at \u00a32,000. </p> <p>Most sales are of registrations in the UK or the USA with the drab suffixes .com or .co.uk. Only a few smart lexiconetheads seem aware of the creative word possibilities of less familiar countries. </p> <p>Tiny Ascension Island, gateway to the Falklands, population 2000 not counting sooty terns, has got itself suffix .ac. I tried registering <a href=\"http://www.bigm.ac\">www.bigm.ac</a> - already gone. So was <a href=\"http://www.applem.ac.\">www.applem.ac.</a> So, to my fury, was <a href=\"http://www.Milan.ac\">www.Milan.ac</a>. </p> <p>But. I have registered <a href=\"http://www.SerieA-Milan.ac\">www.SerieA-Milan.ac</a> - open to offers from Italian football fans. </p> <p>St Helena, where nothing exciting has happened since Napoleon, now has a show-off suffix .sh. That is why I confidently expect to <a href=\"http://www.makemoreca.sh\" target=\"_new\">www.makemoreca.sh</a>. </p> <p> Most amazing of all, South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands have an internet registration for their penguins - a highly useable .gs. Someone beat me to the signature of <a href=\"http://www.RyanGig.gs\">www.RyanGig.gs</a> but I am happy enough in the entertainment business with <a href=\"http://www.musicgi.gs\">www.musicgi.gs</a>. </p> <p>However, I am furious with the Italians. They have the mother of all suffixes .it. There is a new exam helpline business called <a href=\"http://www.revise.it\">www.revise.it</a> and the founders have passed the hardest exam of all - getting an .it registration. </p> <p>The Italians have made it fiendishly complex. Even their embassy could not tell me how to go about it. When I did eventually find an online company to handle Italian registrations, it charged at least four times as much as for other countries and sent me a long incomprehensible form from the Italian registration office in Pisa. </p> <p>I have dozens of domain names pining for their .it ending. But if the cybureaucrats in Pisa are going to make an expensive meal of .it they can <a href=\"http://www.stuff.it\">www.stuff.it.</a> Me and my names are heading for Lithuania, where there is al.lt o play for.</p>",
  "<p>The United Nations wants to do for e-commerce what the web has done for information: create a global standard that will allow anyone and everyone to join in. If it succeeds, it should boost e-business everywhere - especially between small companies, and in the Third World. </p> <p>Through UN/CEFACT the UN has been the major force behind the Edifact (Electronic data interchange for administration, commerce and transport) standard. But while UN/Edifact has been successful, it has not taken over in the American market - many US companies still use their own X12 standard - and it has been too expensive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Klaus-Dieter Naujok, chairman of UN/CEFACT, is keen to redress this with a new standard called ebXML. </p> <p>On a visit to London last week Naujok, from San Francisco, was accompanied by Ray Walker, Britain's e-trade guru, DTI advisor, and chair of the UN/CEFACT steering group. They had contrasting styles - Naujok jokey and outgoing, Walker more quietly-spoken - but the same message, and the tendency to finish one another's points that comes from working in tandem. </p> <p>\"We did something for the big companies with Edifact, and that goes on. But it's vitally important that we get the SMEs involved, and that's much more appreciated in the developing countries than it is here. By getting interoperability, you'll be able to do business with anyone anywhere in the world at any time,\" they said. \"It's trade facilitation, basically.\" </p> <p>This was important for countries such as Bulgaria, Iran and Pakistan, \"which have been a bit out of the mainstream. It's a huge step forward in opening those markets up and enabling those countries to participate in world trade,\" added Walker. </p> <p>The UN's initiative is based on XML, the eXtensible Markup Language backed by Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). When Berners-Lee invented the web, the aim was to provide a simple way of sharing texts and pictures across many different types of computer: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) did that. Now companies need to move structured data around - the kind stored in spreadsheets, databases, and accounts packages. XML does that. </p> <p>For real electronic trading, the data also has to be identified and presented so that a machine can read it, and process it. This is not the same as, for example, phoning in a purchase order, or putting the details in an email message. That may be e-commerce, but it usually depends on having a person to accept and probably retype the data at the other end. </p> <p>In an electronic trading system, a computer could place a purchase order with the supplier's computer (perhaps when prompted by a stock control system) and make the payment without a person being involved at either end. </p> <p>That is already possible using Edifact, but it is used mainly by large companies across dedicated networks or Vans (value-added network services). With XML, small companies will be able to do their electronic trading cheaply \"over the internet in a secure way. That's the most important part\", said Naujok. </p> <p>XML, which first emerged in 1996, is rapidly becoming an important open standard. Its leading backers include three major rivals, IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems. Indeed, Microsoft is basing its whole future strategy, called .Net, on XML. </p> <p>But the problem with XML, quipped Ray Walker, \"is that it's extensible. There are three or four hundred different purchase orders out there in XML format. Businesses don't want that: they want one way of going forward.\" So for global electronic trading, businesses must not only use a common language, they must also standardise their data sets and interfaces to provide interoperability. If ebXML takes off, there could be a single XML standard for business, instead of hundreds. </p> <p>Traditionally, big businesses wrote or customised their own software to handle what they perceived as their unique business needs. Wal-Mart would neither know nor care how Marks &amp; Spencer generated purchase orders. That is why the UN project is using business processes as building blocks, rather than terminology, which varies between firms. \"It's a big thing for Wal-Mart to use the same data set as M&amp;S, but we should distinguish between the internal implementation and what it takes to exchange information. At that level there is more commonality than people like to admit.\" </p> <p>Obviously not every company can be involved with defining ebXML, but UN/CEFACT is working in partnership with Oasis, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards, and numerous industry bodies. These include Acord, for the insurance industry, the Auto motive Industry Action Group (AIAG), footwear manufacturers in the Confederation European de la Chaussure (CEC), the Open Healthcare Group, and the Open Travel Alliance. </p> <p>Last month, members of the Global Commercial Initiative (GCI) adopted ebXML, and the membership includes 40 leading manufacturers and eight trade organisations representing a grand total of 850,000 companies. Peter Jordan, a GCI board director and European systems director for Kraft Foods, said: \"It is clear to us that ebXML will soon become the standard for all global trade.\" </p> <p>All the draft specifications have now been drawn up, and should be finalised at meetings in Tokyo next month, in Vancouver, Canada, in February, and in Vienna, Austria, in May, 2001. Naujok thinks off-the-shelf ebXML software could be available by the beginning of 2002, if not earlier. Walker expects prices to start at around $150. </p> <p>Companies that intend to trade with other companies over the web, or have already started trading electronically, can start asking their software suppliers about their plans to add ebXML compatibility. Especially Microsoft, which has so far remained strangely silent about the whole affair. </p> <p> <strong> Web addresses</strong> </p> <p> ebXML official site <br> <a href=\"http://www.ebxml.org \">www.ebxml.org</a> <br> UN/CEFACT  <a href=\"http://www.unece.org/cefact\">www.unece.org/cefact</a> <br> Oasis  <a href=\"http://www.oasis-open.org \">www.oasis-open.org</a> <br> Group 8760  <a href=\"http://www.8760.com\">www.8760.com</a> <br> W3C  <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/XML/\">www.w3.org/XML/</a> <br> XML  <a href=\"http://www.xml.com\">www.xml.com</a> <br> UN-XML  <a href=\"http://www.edi-tie.nl/edifact/xml-edi.htm \">www.edi-tie.nl/edifact/xml-edi.htm </a></p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.jungle.com/\" target=\"_new\">Jungle.com</a> was swinging confidently through the virtual trees expecting an immensely successful flotation on the stock market. But the leading UK e-tailer, like many other dot.coms, was suddenly brought down to earth with a painful bump when hordes of investors began to frantically dump over-valued technology stocks. </p> <p>Seeking extra cash and a concrete strategy for the future, Jungle.com linked up in September with the UK-based catalogue retail group, Great Universal Stores. To take control of Jungle, GUS agreed to pay \u00a337m. </p> <p>This move has been seen as evidence that traditional bricks and mortar companies are now striking back. As dot.coms have tumbled in price, they are swooping down and trying to snap up some virtual bargains. Their aim is to gain quick entry into the online economy, with an established brand and the technology, without having to take on the risk of launching their own start up operations. </p> <p>\"A year ago everyone was saying the new economy is here and the old economy is dead. Now everyone is saying dot coms are dead and the dinosaurs have won. Both of these are overstatements and the truth is somewhere in between,\" says Andersen's UK head of e-strategy, Andrew Mendoza, who expects to see plenty more corporates closing in to acquire dot.coms. </p> <p>For his part, Jungle.com's chief executive and founder, Steve Bennett still feels some disappointment that his company failed to cut it as a stand-alone web e-tailer. </p> <p>'If you roll out five years from now when you will have higher internet penetration, then you will find it easier to be a stand alone online business. Today it makes much more sense to be part of a group,\" he says. </p> <p>Being a part of GUS has relieved a lot of the pressure that Bennett was under. The deal has meant that Jungle.com's marketing and customer acquisition costs have now been considerably reduced. GUS own Argos and it is able to use its purchasing power to introduce more electrical goods to Jungle's site. The company also promotes Jungle's services through its stores. </p> <p>Faced with potential rich pickings from the dot.com world, it can be difficult for bricks and mortar companies to know the exact value of what they are buying. Often the main knowledge about an e- business is stored in the heads of a few of the dot.com directors and predatory corporates have to be careful to hold onto those key staff when they start plotting their mergers and acquisitions. </p> <p>Kingfisher, which owns Comet, B&amp;Q and Woolworths, has set up a dedicated unit to invest in dot.coms. Launching the e-Kingfisher service, chief executive Geoffrey Mulcahy pointed out that sales of more than \u00a311bn in Kingfisher's market sectors in Germany, France and the UK will have moved online by 2004. He wants Kingfisher to \"grasp e-commerce and develop value and service-driven direct channels to customers which respond effectively to their changing needs\". </p> <p>Already Kingfisher has invested in the natural health and body care site, <a href=\"http://www.ThinkNatural.com\" target=\"_new\">Think Natural.com</a>, on the grounds that it complements Superdrug's high street offering. </p> <p>\"They offer us a brand which is in a space we're not in and they offer us online expertise,\" explains chief executive of e-Kingfisher Ventures, Stephen O'Brien. \"I don't think if you're a bricks and mortar retailer you're going to automatically succeed in the online world. We have to make the right alliances and move quickly into the right space.\" </p> <p>He adds that B&amp;Q has invested in <a href=\"http://Improveline.com/\" target=\"_new\">Improveline.com</a> which recommends DIY professionals to help people carry out their home improvements. But does he think bricks and mortar companies and dot.coms are entirely compatible? </p> <p>\"There are slight differences in culture,\" admits O'Brien. \"The dot.com start-ups are usually very lean and have very few people and they are used to cutting through things more quickly.\" He thinks a number of pure internet retailers will succeed on their own but, generally, he feels bricks and mortar and dot.com partnerships can strengthen both parties - especially when it comes to finance. </p> <p>\"In recent times, financial advisers have been much happier when someone like us has been alongside a dot.com,\" he says. </p> <p>The fact that corporates are making their presence felt is largely a symptom of the fact that the internet market is still immature. Steve Bennett acknowledges that bricks and mortar companies have a part to play in the market's development but in the long term he believes stand alone web e-tailers will change the face of shopping. </p> <p>\"When you buy a CD online it is a much better experience than going to HMV or Virgin,\" he argues. \"It's cheaper and you can listen to every track.\" </p> <p>The ability of the internet to cut costs also convinces him that the new medium will transform old business models. He points out that traditional catalogue companies can now send out one-to-one personalised emails taking account of a customer's previous shopping preferences which is much cheaper than shipping out hefty publications. </p> <p>Just recently <a href=\"http://www.LastMinute.com\" target=\"_new\">LastMinute.com</a> impressed web sceptics in the City when it announced the appointment of Allan Leighton as non-executive chairman. His bricks and mortar credentials are impeccable. Until recently he was chief executive of Wal-Mart Europe and before that he was group chief executive of the Asda Group. </p> <p> Martha Lane Fox, Lastminute's co-founder, argues that there is little difference between e-tailers and traditional bricks and mortar retailers. \"We just happen to deliver through the internet. There are obviously some differences but at the same time the same challenges face us all. The focus is on delivering services and value to our customers.\" </p> <p>Needless to say there is likely to be more of a dot.com shake up over the coming months. But in spite of the headline-grabbing failures, the fact remains that bricks and mortar companies and their top executives are now actively seeking out and integrating themselves with a few select dot.coms which suggests that e-business is slowly shaping up to become a real business of the future.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Have you been using computers and the internet for long?</strong> I bought an Atari ST 520 and a sampler with the royalty cheque from my first album in about 1987. I got into the internet in the early 90s. Just the concept that there's all this knowledge available that you can access via the telephone is exciting and it really has empowered us. You can go from looking at pictures of the Mars landings to finding out what your car is all about. From downloading the latest software to listening to jazz radio stations in America. </p> <p><strong> Is the net still an exciting place to be?</strong> I think it's becoming more exciting. I travel a lot and I can't wait for the time when, instead of the boring TV in the corner of your room, you just have a computer. When I left school computer studies was a minor option but now it's almost as important as taking maths or English. </p> <p><strong> Were you disappointed with the poor showing of Wap?</strong> I didn't really bother with Wap as it's not what I was looking for at all. I carry a Macintosh G3 around and hook that up to the internet instead. </p> <p><strong> How have formats such as MP3 affected the traditional forms of music distribution?</strong> It's similar to when they brought DAT (digital audio tapes) in and everyone was panicking about that. There will always be a certain amount of panic when you introduce new technology. I don't like the sound of MP3 as it takes away the high-end frequencies such as the snare drum. It affects reverb as well. In terms of having 20 MP3 files in my laptop as opposed to carrying 20 CDs around then it is quite convenient and I am very much into it. </p> <p><strong> Do you enjoy the relationship between technology and music?</strong> Definitely. When I started making music with my Atari it was a ridiculously feeble machine! I think I composed one advert on that as opposed to now where I've just done a whole album on my computer.

I can check balances and pay regular bills up to month ahead to organisations for which I had made prior arrangement (eg services and credit cards).

  "British diplomats were finally allowed access to a Cuban prison last night to speak to a team of private investigators jailed on suspicion of spying. <p>But political tensions between Britain and Cuba were still strained after the Cuban government appeared convinced that the British private detectives were involved in international espionage. </p> <p>Cuba granted British diplomats in Havana access to the seven detainees following tense negotiations where the country's charg\u00e9 d'affaires in London was summoned to meet foreign office minister Peter Hain. Previously the Cubans had refused all requests to grant access and were accused of breaching human rights. </p> <p>The Cuban authorities are still investigating allegations that the Britons had been hired for private investigation into a case of infidelity involving a Cuban national, for which they were using methods in breach of Cuban law. </p> <p>According to earlier reports, the detectives were hired to spy on Mike Nahmad, the head of Cuba's Genpower firm, a Panamanian company which supplies much of Fidel Castro's regime with electricity. His is the only 100% foreign-owned private company in the country. </p> <p>It was reported that the men were hired to trap the millionaire suspected of adultery. </p> <p>But Mr Nahmad's wife told Channel 4 last night she had no idea about the furore. \"I am married to Mr Nahmad and I don't know anything about what you are telling me.\" </p> <p>Mr Hain, calling the incident \"rather bizarre\", added \"I asked either that charges be brought against the detainees straightaway, or that they be released.\" </p> <p>The six men and a woman - believed to be the girlfriend of a detective - are being held by the department of state security in Havana. They were arrested on October 8. </p> <p>The British charge d'affaires in Cuba attempted to visit the detainees in the state security prison again yesterday. But a Foreign Office spokesman said: \"He was denied access to them by the Cuban authorities. He was assured they were in good health.\" </p> <p>Cuba's about-face came after the meeting with Mr Hain at 5.30pm yesterday when the Foreign Office was told the meeting could take place within two hours. </p> <p>Sources said last night that the team was suspected of spying on Cuba's sensitive network of outdated Soviet-built power stations which are undergoing refurbishment. </p> <p>It was strongly suspected that they were spying on sensitive sites to provide information for other countries, possibly with links to America which still has a hostile relationship with Cuba over trade embargos. </p> <p>Six of the detainees worked for SIP Investigations, based in Snarebrook, east London. They include the firm's owner, Ken Lodge, fellow Londoner, John Fawcett, Derek Pitt from Hertfordshire, two men identified only as Will Smart and Mike, and the latter's girlfriend. </p> <p>British authorities were told of the detentions on October 9 but did not receive written notification until October 13. </p> <p>They were told the Cuban authorities had undertaken to provide access to a lawyer, believed to be local. </p> <p>Last night a source close to the the Cuban department of state security said there had been no official statement in Havana relating to the arrests and the matter had not been reported in the Cuban media. </p> <p>\"Off the record, the government is very much convinced that there is something more beneath the surface than a wife suspecting her husband of cheating,\" said a source. </p> <p>\"The government suspects these Britons may have been used as a way of destabilising the improved relations with Britain. One angle being looked at is they were given a red herring over this matrimonial dispute and dragged into something bigger than they could handle. </p> <p>\"There is a sense of amazement that a team of private detectives could indulge in such a foolish exercise, especially as the man they were tailing was a powerful individual and easily able to get official protection for his privacy.\"</p>"
