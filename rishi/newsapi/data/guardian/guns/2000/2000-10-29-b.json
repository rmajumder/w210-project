  "<p>At the respective ends of the rainbow that curled high over the stadium after this tumultuous match in torrential rain, there was potential gold for Reading but a growing pile of dust for Oxford United. As Reading regained the Second Division leadership with two goals in the last 12 minutes from their substitute, Tony Rougier, Oxford, stranded at the foot of the table, reflected on the likelihood of two divisions separating them from their neighbours next autumn. </p> <p>Yet seldom have a club, described beforehand as 'an absolute shambles' by caretaker chief Mike Ford, come so close to managing a victory that would have ranked as the upset of the season. Without a manager since Denis Smith was forced upstairs, or a point now from nine away games, Oxford are in disarray on and off the pitch. Yet their neat passing, revolving around the industrious Matty Murphy, belied their plight. </p> <p>They started anxiously. Within five minutes Lee Hodges had sent in Jamie Cureton to bang a shot against the advancing Richard Knight and to hit an upright from the rebound. Cureton made a dreadful hash of John Richardson's woeful back pass two minutes later. Reading's first goal came after 28 minutes. When Cureton's drive was blocked, Lee Jarman brought down Darren Caskey, who stroked home the penalty without fuss. Oxford had not threatened a goal until their former goalkeeper, Phil Whitehead, fell on to the by-line as he arched backwards going for Ricky Newman's headed back-pass. As the ball squirmed from his grasp, Derek Lilley overcame his disbelief to slide it into the gaping net. </p> <p>Murphy swung and missed at the chance that could have given Oxford the lead before Reading punished them. Their erratic shooting had not troubled Knight before he dropped a routine 68th- minute attempt from Caskey. Cureton smashed in a loose ball to herald a goal spree. </p> <p>Within a minute Oxford had equalised. Peter Fear's free-kick was driven back by Jarman and turned into his own net by Adi Viveash. In the 72nd minute Oxford did score a goal from the coaching manual when Richardson glanced in Fear's corner. Oxford's jubilant supporters sensed the shock of all shocks. But their team could not cling on, thanks to Alan Pardew's inspired substitution. He sent on Rougier, who obliged by driving in Hodges's corner which fell conveniently for him at the far post. </p> <p>Not content with his first goal for the club, the Trinidadian was no less clinical from Jim McIntyre's subsequent deep cross. The ball bounced tamely clear from Andy Linighan's outstretched leg and in a cloud of spray Rougier buried the wayward clearance to send Oxford away sodden and sad.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday morning's breakfast will not have been a cheery occasion in the Knightsbridge home of Daily Mail editor-in-chief Paul Dacre. A highly personal campaign by his papers to discredit one of British television's high-fliers, Dawn Airey of Channel 5, had just backfired. Late on Friday afternoon, the station announced that Airey was being promoted to become Channel 5's chief executive. The pornographer-in-chief was being put in charge of the brothel. </p> <p>It is a blunt repudiation of the Mail 's highly personal and sometimes vindictive campaign against 39-year-old Airey. It reminds us once again that the moral majoritarians who control the paper, and those who identify with them, have less grip upon the heartlands of Britain than they like to think. </p> <p>Just four months ago, the Mail unleashed a campaign of vilification against Channel 5 for broadcasting Naked Jungle , a gameshow hosted by middle-aged presenter Keith Chegwin with no clothes on. Billed cheekily by Airey as an 'exploration of naturism', the programme was remarkable more for the startling slightness of Chegwin's member than any sauciness from the contestants, who also undressed. </p> <p>The Mail 's blitzkrieg on the show monickered the broadcasters Channel Filth. But six weeks later the Broadcasting Standards Commission conceded that they had received just seven complaints from members of the public. 'It just did not appear to have upset people and generated a tiny response,' said then BSC chairman Lord Holme. </p> <p>If only Channel 5's detractors could see it, it was a classic demonstration of the marketing nous that has made the station a success. After its shaky launch in the spring of 1997 when half its new viewers saw screens of white snow, it now reaches 84 per cent of British house holds, and looks set to challenge Channel 4's market share. </p> <p>'We never quite understand why people happily make all the fuss, but we're very grateful,' said a senior source at the station's chic, but modest, central London head office. 'All we have to do is lob a gentle firecracker. The tabloid newspapers go bonkers. Hardly anything ever gets put in a written press release, so no one can say we misled them. And we get publicity we just couldn't buy. Millions tune in to see our so-called pornography. If 5 per cent of them stay behind for some other programme we're laughing all the way to the bank.' </p> <p>Airey gave a personal demonstration of exactly this tactic when she appeared on Question Time in March this year. Innocently observing that her station's celebrated 'adult output' was being broadcast at exactly the same time as the BBC1 programme, she caused two million viewers to switch over. </p> <p>But what BBC1's disloyal audience would have seen is hardly pornography at all. It is the gentle smut that has been available on adult cable channels across Europe and America for years. If anyone at Channel 5 sits glued to the screen previewing its bought-in late night films, they are extremely unlikely to go blind before its soft-focus footage of boobies and bottoms. </p> <p>It exemplifies the channel under Airey and her team. The ethos extends not just to late-night films, but to gentle middlebrow broadcasting. Daytime sofa chat hosted by Gloria Hunniford, the competition Fort Boyard fronted by Melinda Messenger and her famous embonpoint , and, of course, Chegwin. The five nights-a-week soap Family Affairs - which had its own Marchioness-style disaster - attracts three million viewers a week. </p> <p>Channel 5's high water mark so far was BBC and ITV's notorious 'Black Wednesday' on 8 September 1999. Screening England's crucial Euro 2000 qualifier against Poland in Warsaw, the station achieved an audience of 5.6 million. </p> <p>Current audience share, touching 6 per cent of total TV viewing after just four years on air, demonstrates that many mid-market viewers are rather more astute than Britain's legion of snooty TV critics. </p> <p>While it remains painfully obvious that most Channel 5 programmes are low budget, TV consumers have noticed that this makes them no different from much of the output now also shown on ITV, Channel 4 and BBC1. </p> <p>Last Sunday, with the benefit of the blockbuster film Mrs Doubtfire , audience share rose to 9.2 per cent. That is where Airey comes in. Her predecessor David Elstein, edged out last week with a \u00a34 million share option sweetener, was committed to the 'films, football and fucking' agenda once attributed to Airey herself. </p> <p>However, a colleague of Airey's explained yesterday: 'Dawn does believe that you can grow the entire audience. Some of that will come down to budget and programme quality, but there is a recognition that lifestyle shows and light, but not pretentious, documentaries have a role to play in building audience profile. </p> <p>'You don't always have to have the highest audience to guarantee the highest ad yields if you start picking up ABC1s, even when they're promiscuous viewers. Dawn knows that Channel 5 has no constituency which sits down and turns it on automatically, a sort of lethargy which still benefits the BBC and ITV. We have to win them over almost every time. She wants C5 to become more sticky, so people hang around.' </p> <p>The channel has already launched a series of innocent 'smily' adverts to emphasise its general appeal to family audiences and the late-night boobies are not quite as prevalent as they were. However, there is still likely to be 'creative tension' with Richard Eyre, the devoutly Christian director of strategy for RTL, Channel 5's main shareholder. Eyre, once improbably reported to speak in tongues at a south London Baptist church, insists: 'I would never interfere in programme content on the basis of my personal beliefs.' </p> <p>Airey's determination is not in doubt. Anyone who has observed her in the gym - redfaced and awash with sweat - will gather that she is a woman who takes almost everything very seriously. Indeed. </p> <p>She has supreme self-belief. Last year, she trained at Harvard Business School while continuing to run her fledgling channel. Her personal critics have often apparently been motivated by the unpleasant envy habitual when a woman in Britain does well -she must be unbalanced, or sex-starved or, as novelist Will Self chose to hint in a newspaper interview, lesbian. </p> <p>But Airey gives the impression of appearing not to care. Her matey bonhomie, which makes Mo Mowlam look restrained, is widely admired. And her Cambridge background, just like her predecessor's double-first, is kept well-disguised. What you see, her friends insist, is what you get. Nobody who has studied her previous form - links with Drop The Dead Donkey , Don't Forget Your Toothbrush and The Big Breakfast - can be under any illusion as to the sort of broadcasting she champions. She will also seek to use an increased budget to boost sports coverage. </p> <p>A BBC source has suggested that it might have been an approach from Greg Dyke - a firm admirer - that precipitated C5's decision to promote Airey. But in future she will look over-qualified to be a mere programme controller. The chief executive's job at a merged ITV, expected within the next three years, almost certainly beckons. </p> <p>And while the critics continue to carp at Channel 5, it will still be less from censoriousness than old-fashioned snobbishness. Paul Dacre might be disgusted by its 'Carry On Don't Lose Your Bra' public persona, tempered by a dark touch of Joe Orton - this autumn's scheduling highlights include a weekly post-mortem show - and promoted with the irreverence of St Trinians mischiefmakers. But it all touches a seam in the British psyche. Under Airey, this knowing televisual Bacchanalia is unlikely to fizzle out. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk\">ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Television is bad for us. It corrodes the moral fabric of society and corrupts our children with relentless images of violence. Well, that's what the proponents of increased television regulation - politicians, social campaigners and certain elements of the media- would like us to believe. </p> <p>Yet events on one of the world's most remote inhabited islands tell a different and fascinating story, one which is less palatable to those who seek an convenient scapegoat for the ills of modern society. </p> <p>Five years ago, television arrived on St Helena, in the South Atlantic. Previously, the inhabitants of this isolated British sovereignty, to which Napoleon Bonaparte was exiled, had no access to broadcast television. Amid the excitement of its arrival, there was concern that exposure to television would have a detrimental impact on the island's children, previously shown to be among the best behaved in the world. </p> <p>This event provided researchers with a rare opportunity to examine the effects of television in a real-life setting both before and after its arrival. Previous research had mostly relied on studies in artificial laboratory conditions. Findings have been contradictory, with some studies providing conclusive evidence of links between television viewing and antisocial behaviour, others claiming beneficial effects and some denying any links at all. What all these studies had in common was that they lacked real life. The opportunity to gather pre- and post-TV-watching data using a whole population (rather than samples) of children was gratefully seized by myself and colleagues; here was a real chance toput television on trial. </p> <p>The St Helena research project began collecting data two years before television arrived, chiefly by observing children in classrooms and school playgrounds. Other information came from teachers and pupils themselves. These data showed children to be hard working and very well behaved. After television became available, most of the same measures were repeated in each of the next five years. Additionally, children's viewing was sampled and a content analysis of the programmes watched, indicating the amount of violence seen, was also undertaken. And in the post-TV phase, comparisons were made between viewers' and non-viewers' behaviour. Links were also investigated between children's behaviour and the levels of violence they saw. </p> <p>The project's latest findings, using observations of children's playground behaviour, are being presented today at the international meeting on children's film and media education in Varise, Italy. Contrary to most other research, they show - after five years of viewing - that television does not unequivocally or inevitably influence children's social behaviour in adverse ways. These results are entirely consonant with other findings from the project over the past four years. </p> <p>One feasible explanation for this finding came from a recorded group discussion with older students. They concluded it was difficult to engage in anti-social acts on the island 'because everyone watches you... everyone knows you... you've just got to behave'. Seemingly, family and community social controls were more persuasive in shaping children's behaviour than exposure to television. There is a ring of truth about this reasoning, as most parents will know. </p> <p>In a similar vein, research elsewhere has shown that high levels of social control and strong informal support networks are influential in shaping behaviour. Adults would be involved in both. However, the influence of significant adults is seldom considered when causes of anti-social behaviour are sought. While it hurts to admit that children's flawed behaviour is often shaped by us, a denial of this only masks untoward consequences of considerable changes in our lives. </p> <p>For instance, support networks are less conspicuous now than a generation ago. Families, neighbourhoods and communities have lost much of their unity and influence Many homes are now headed by single parents. Marriages have declined, divorce rates have risen and kinship links have weakened. </p> <p>Levels of care, compassion and togetherness have dwindled in many neighbourhoods and communities. Urban apathy is widespread and children often grow up away from the watchful eyes of close relatives. Increasingly, both parents are away from home during workday hours. And, all too easily, young family members may be left unsupervised in the home and neighbourhood. </p> <p>These changes have given many youngsters unlimited opportunities to learn anti-social traits from their unsupervised TV viewing, as well as freely practise them without fear of detection, let alone retribution. </p> <p>Cases of vandalism, theft, assaults and public-order offences have become commonplace in many of our towns and cities, yet reproaching television succeeds only in deflecting attention from the actual source of our concerns. Quite simply, it is often the case (within and outside homes) that there are too few adults around who are willing and able to supervise and check youngsters' (and others') behaviour satisfactorily. </p> <p>In St Helena, what we are witnessing is how healthy family, neighbourhood and community forces can combine effectively in shaping children's behaviour. Although young viewers can learn anti-social behaviour from television, opportunities to practise it are limited by the presence of watchful eyes. </p> <p>There are lessons to be learned from St Helena. Nevertheless, the dilemma facing most westernised communities is more about how to revive and then utilise these influential forces rather than about current arguments on watersheds and regulatory controls. </p> <p>\u0095 Professor Tony Charlton is a psycologist at the Centre for Behaviour Studies in Cheltenham, and part of the St Helena research team.</p>",
  "<p>Prince Edward's hapless TV career will be in the spotlight again this week as his company prepares to announce substantial losses for the eighth year running. Ardent Productions will disclose that its annual operating losses almost doubled, from \u00a3122,000 in 1998 to \u00a3222,000 last year. </p> <p>Ardent, set up by the Prince in 1993, has now posted cumulative losses of \u00a31.9 million. The firm has paid no corporation tax since Edward launched it with the promise that it would become 'one of the top 12' British TV production houses by 2000. </p> <p>The company's principal current project is a documentary about the sex lives of young British expatriates. X-Pats will include scenes of a financial trader who uses transvestite prostitutes, according to a source at Channel 5, which commissioned it. Ardent is also working on interview programmes featuring veteran singers. </p> <p>Last year, the Prince provoked outrage by telling the New York Times that the British 'hate anyone who succeeds'. Americans responded to his programme proposals, he claimed, 'like a breath of fresh air'. </p> <p>John Whiting, a partner at the leading accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, said yesterday: 'In normal circumstances, if a firm showed losses for six years, that would be an automatic trigger point for [the Inland Revenue] asking questions about why they are losing money. They will want to be satisfied that there is genuinely a loss.' </p> <p>Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes, said: 'It is very curious when any company appears to make losses indefinitely.' He too would expect the Revenue to check on such a company. </p> <p>Ardent pays \u00a350,000 a year in rent to another firm controlled by Edward for offices at Bagshot Park, the Surrey seat of the Prince and his wife, the Countess of Wessex. </p> <p>Local estate agents Chancellor &amp; Sons said offices were available more cheaply nearby. 'A broad price guide would be \u00a310 a square foot, with very reasonable property available for \u00a315,' said the firm's Max Scott. Rent for an ample office for 12 staff could be between \u00a37,500 and \u00a311,250 a year, rather than the \u00a350,000 which Ardent can currently offset against future tax liabilities. </p> <p>There is, no doubt, an entirely innocent explanation, however Ardent chairman Malcolm Cockren was unavailable to comment. </p> <p>It emerged earlier this year that almost \u00a32 million of public money has been spent on refurbishing Bagshot Park since Edward moved in in 1997. The Ministry of Defence, its former owner, funded the repairs after the Prince signed a 50-year lease to rent the property from the Crown Estate. Buckingham Palace insisted the repairs would have been carried out at public expense regardless of who lived in the property, built by Queen Victoria for her third son, Arthur, Duke of Connaught. </p> <p>The London-based building firm C J Sims, which did the refurbishment, went into receivership earlier this year. It said one of its outstanding payments was \u00a3600,000 owed by the Prince. </p> <p>Ardent's new accounts, due to be filed at Companies House by Tuesday, will say its turnover was \u00a3326,210 last year, down from \u00a3424,773, and that its distribution company, Ardent International Sales, made a loss of \u00a328,731. </p> <p>Shareholders, who each provided up to \u00a3200,000 in funding when the company was founded, included the Sultan of Brunei and Sir Tom Farmer, the chairman of the Kwik-Fit car exhaust centres. Farmer insisted last summer that: 'The Prince has definitely got what it takes.' </p> <p>Early Ardent commissions included an appreciation of real tennis, the Prince's hobby, and Annie's Bar, a political soap opera made for Channel 4 but axed after one series. Edward on Edward, a documentary about Prince Edward's great uncle Edward VII, was sold all over the world, as was the Crown and Country series. But both attracted criticism that the Prince was trading on his royal connections. </p> <p>Sophie Rhys-Jones, who married Edward last June, has also been accused of trading on her royal links to help her public relations company, R-JH, which has represented Rover as well as a string of society clients. </p> <p>Last year, Edward was embroiled in controversy after agreeing to sell footage of his wedding to TV companies. A drama about the Queen Mother was cancelled after the subject reportedly protested. </p> <p>The Prince has shown some entrepreneurial initiative in the past two years. He earned a reported \u00a3200,000 fee for a seven-day speaking programme in the United States. He gave an after-dinner address at a \u00a3129-a-head dinner at a London hotel to launch a book accompanying his Crown and Country series. And he was said to have received \u00a330,000 for a lecture on the 1992 fire and restoration at Windsor Castle. </p> <p>The Earl and Countess of Wessex, currently on a trip to Brunei, receive \u00a396,000 a year from the Queen's Civil List payments to cover the cost of official engagements. Last week, the couple and their staff were in Malaysia, where Edward was criticised for putting a trade fair exhibit on his head. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk\">ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> http://<a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk/family/  edward.htm\">www.royal.gov.uk/family/ edward.htm</a> <br>The monarchy's official website</p>",
  "<p>After six goalless hours and defeats to Manchester United and Liverpool, Leicester finally rediscovered their scoring touch to right what had been a season in danger of serious decline. 'It was important to win after the two defeats,' said Peter Taylor, their manager. 'Now the league table looks nice again.' </p> <p>Amid a swirling wind and constant rain, it was a day for close control and fine passing. But all three goals were controlled long-range strikes that gave the two keepers no chance. </p> <p>Derby, without a win and marooned in last place, took a surprise lead against what is still a sturdy defence. Rory Delap was the scorer, receiving the ball 25 yards from goal and turning to arrow a shot past Tim Flowers. </p> <p>But Flowers gained revenge by claiming an assist in the equaliser, his long clearance finding Muzzy Izzet who took the ball in his stride before hammering a 25-yard shot past Mart Poom. </p> <p>Derby had impressed in the first half but faltered in the second. The home side gradually increased in dominance, but when the inevitable goal arrived it was from an unlikely source. Arnar Gunnlaugson, loaned out to Stoke City last season, came off the bench to score with his first touch. And what a touch it was, stroking the ball over Poom from, you guessed it, about 25 yards. </p> <p>'I can understand Leicester supporters being desperate for us to win this game,' said Taylor. 'I presume that if we had not got the three points they might have thought that some of my thoughts were elsewhere, but that is a load of rubbish.' </p> <p>Taylor has to prepare Leicester for games against Crystal Palace and Manchester City in the next week but will have to turn his thoughts to England at some point. He will squeeze in a meeting with his international assistant Steve McClaren to discuss the squad for next month's Italy game. </p> <p>How his opposite number Jim Smith must dream of such distractions. His only worry now is when the axe will fall on his increasingly unpopular reign. For now he is waiting for Colin Todd's expected arrival from Swindon, 'a crazy situation now in the hands of the lawyers'. </p> <p>'We deserved something from the game but they scored with two tremendous strikes,' Smith said. 'It shows that when things aren't going for you that sort of thing can happen. But my lads gave everything in terms of endeavour.'</p>",
  "<p><strong> Taliban football: just do it</strong> </p> <p>The uneasy relationship between the Taliban militia and re-emerging Afghan football worsened last week after armed religious police stormed a match and chased away the players to enforce a new law banning sport in the afternoon. Officials said the match was raided because it had gone 10 minutes beyond the 4pm deadline set by the Taliban supreme leader Mullah Mohammad Omar. </p> <p>The incident was typical of the growing problems since football was re-authorised in 1998 after years of Islamic prohibition - during which the Kandahars football stadium was turned over exclusively to public executions and limb amputation (attracting 35,000 capacity crowds). In July this year, members of a visiting Pakistani junior team were arrested at gun point during a game because they arrived wearing shorts. 'Only five players were able to escape,' said captain Abdul Qayuum. 'The rest were rounded up and had their heads shaven as a punishment.' Supporters, meanwhile, are forbidden to clap, and instead are obliged - again at gun point - to cheer both sides equally with chants of 'Allahu Akbar'. As a result, the game is struggling to re-establish its popularity. 'Executions and punishments here at the stadium are excellent but do not mean the Islamic Emirate is not interested in sport,' says spokesman Mullah Abdul Shukur Motmain. 'I just hope the same number of people will come to see the matches.' </p> <p><strong>Leeds row: the ref was right</strong> </p> <p>'Leeds sold down the Riva' blasted the Star last week after Rivaldo's Champions League injury time goal against Leeds: 'it was a ridiculous amount of extra time'. The Sun - 'Barc-ing mad' - agreed, David O'Leary 'couldn't understand it', the Yorkshire Post said it was 'the kind of overtime which used to pay for miners' holidays', and the Mirror wrote of the 'injustice of the phantom four minutes': 'What should have been a momentous occasion for David O'Leary's young team turned sour... Where the four extra minutes came from will remain a mystery.' Well - not quite. Observer IQ statisticans at Elland Road, using Uefa backed measures, saw straight away that the ref was right. In total, there were 3mins 43 seconds of stoppages - Rivaldo struck with 28 seconds to spare.

According to Dr Alfredo Cahe, 'this is a significant risk - although, I suppose, he cannot stay in Cuba for ever.' Maradona evidently disagrees. After admitting privately to being underwhelmed by the modest size of his new club, Almagro, he's decided to manage them from his Cuban cottage - 4,200 miles away. 'At least someone has made me an offer and I suppose that's something,' he told friends. No-one, though, seems to have warned Almagro president Dardo de Marchi. 'Having Diego here will be like touching heaven,' he said last week.

  "<p> It doesn't take long to find the essence of Alaska. Just get off the plane at Anchorage - if you're lucky it'll be above freezing - and the first person you bump into will more likely than not be called Brad, wear a lumberjack shirt, work in oil, have a pick-up truck with twin gun racks and ask you: 'Did you know Alaska is a third the size of the lower 48 states and it's only got 600,000 people, 300,000 of them are in Anchorage?' The second question they ask is: 'Have you come for the fishing?' </p> <p>Alaskans are rightly proud of their state's size. It oozes bigness. It is wild and it is empty. It has north America's highest mountain, and its last true wilderness. It has the world's most dramatic fjords with glaciers crashing into them. Before I walked from the suburbs of Anchorage up the sharp 4,500ft Wolverine Peak, the taxi driver warned me to be careful of bears. Like yeah, right by the city I thought. </p> <p>'Yeah!', said the few walkers I met, all with their bear-bells tinkling away, before regaling me with stories of bear attacks in the suburbs. </p> <p>Not that bears are the only problem. Last year, a man got trampled to death by a moose outside his son's school in Anchorage. It was caught on video, and, of course, it was shown repeatedly on the news. 'I thought that was a bit tasteless,' said an Alaskan called Brad on top of Wolverine Peak, Anchorage stretching out to the sea below, and endless wilderness behind. </p> <p>Everything about Alaska has bigness, including the people (they have to make their bar stools especially wide). Everyone has a car but they also have two-, four-, six-seater planes. With very few roads, and such vast distances, it is the only real way to get about once you leave the cities. As you drive into Anchorage, you find a lake which is a boatplane equivalent of a car park. </p> <p>Both main airports have vast areas set aside for private aircraft. That's the poor people's private planes. Anyone who is even middle income appears to have their own landing strip in their backyard. As you circle above the suburbs of Fairbanks, Alaska's second city, each house has a car on the drive and a plane on the landing strip. </p> <p>Alaska is the last frontier. On the north coast, you can visit the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This, too, is vast, home to teeming caribou, the nearly extinct pre-historically shaggy musk ox, grizzly bears, golden eagles, moose, polar bears and snow geese. </p> <p>It has been dubbed 'America's Serengeti' but, unlike the Tanzanian park, it has no roads, not even any human trails, huts, or landing strips. It is pure wilderness, as wild as it was before the advent of man. The only way you can visit it is by chartering a plane. As you weave in and out of the mountains and foothills, the pilot will find a gravel bank of a river to land on, drop you, and agree to pick you up at the same time, same place the following week. </p> <p>In between, it's just you, your guide, and Mother Nature. </p> <p>Alaska is famous for being cold, and rightly so. In the little village of Barrow on the north coast last year, it plunged to minus 77C (-107F). It's so cold, the tyres on cars freeze solid. The flat part in contact with the road when you park stays frozen flat as you drive off, giving a bumpy ride and a noise like 'ker-klunk, ker-klunk, ker-klunk' for 10 miles until the rubber warms up. </p> <p>One Alaskan told me he didn't mind the cold: 'I look upon it as population control.' In the spring, people from the rest of the US come to Alaska, fall in love 'but by December, they're usually aching to get back,' he said. </p> <p>And while it's cold, it's dark. In winter you get little or no light - but there is some compensation. Fairbanks declares itself the 'Northern Lights capital of the world', with stunning red, green, blue curtains of light dancing across the sky 220 nights a year. In the newspapers, they carry not just weather forecasts, but aurora forecasts. The dark winter also means a light summer, when days literally never end and merge one into another at the midnight sun. </p> <p>I bumped into the Bishop of Alaska - he said it's the Anglican church's biggest diocese - while he commuted from church to church by plane. As the Right Rev Mark McDonald gave me a lift to the airport in his pick-up, he announced with delight that his wife had got buffalo for dinner: it made a nice change to caribou, which was their usual meat. 'How did she get that?' I asked. 'In the supermarket?' 'Possibly, though she might have shot it,' said the bishop. The Alaskans are big on hunting, but they do it for food. 'The one thing that unites the whites and the natives is disgust at the trophy hunters who come up here from Texas and shoot a moose just to cut its head off and stuff it,' said McDonald, 'It's just such a waste.' </p> <p>Many of the native Americans still subsist off wild animals. The Gwich'in tribe of Athabascan Indians live off the caribou that migrate through their remote land in the far north of Alaska, as they have for the last 10,000 years. </p> <p>In the community of Arctic Village, a hundred miles north of the Arctic Circle, and 100 miles from any other human habitation, the young men spend months dividing their time between hunting caribou and playing computer games. It's a haunting land of stunted trees and moss-clad tundra, encircled by hulking mountains. </p> <p>Two feet down the soil is frozen all year round, forming an impenetrable layer that forces water to coalesce into endless pools, lakes, and meandering, directionless, lazy riverlets. </p> <p>The log cabins of Arctic Village, its store with just a few tins in it, its wooden church, and gravel roads with no cars, have a cosy, friendly atmosphere. You can chat with the locals, whose mother tongue is now English, or walk up to the mountain. I went in surprisingly warm summer days, but a guide told me it was better to visit in winter: it's more unusual, haunting, and you have the staggering, almost endless displays of Northern Lights. </p> <p>The only trouble is that with temperatures so low, your plane may get 'weathered in' and you'll spend more days in there than you planned.</p> <p><strong>Getting there </strong></p> <p>Flights from London to Anchorage start at about \u00a3450, They usually require two changes </p> <p>Internal flights are available from Alaskan Airlines 00 1 800 252 7522 and also Frontier Flying Service 00 1 907 474 0014</p> <p>Tours of Arctic Village are organised by Arctic Village Tours 00 1 907 479 46 48, <a href=\"http://www.arcticvillagetours.com\">www.arcticvillagetours.com</a> or email the company on <a href=\"mailto:alaska@arcticvillagetours.com\">alaska@arcticvillagetours.com</a>.</p> <p>Trips to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are organised by Alaska Wilderness Journeys 00 1 907 733 4444.</p> <p>Other tours are organised by Northern Alaskan Tour Company 00 1 907 474 8600 and North Star Adventures 00 1 570 297 4015 441552.</p>",
  "John O'Donoghue, the Irish Justice Minister, announced the launch last Tuesday of a \u00a34.5 million package designed to combat racism and heighten public awareness of the problem. <p>He told the Dail that the aim of the programme would be 'to help create a more inclusive society in Ireland, where racial prejudice is effectively outlawed and cultural diversity is regarded as a strength'. </p> <p>His words are likely to ring hollow with Aftab Ahmed, whose restaurant in Co Kildare was daubed recently with the words 'Leave or die'. A Pakistani married to an Irishwoman, Aftab opened his Tandoori Empire restaurant a year ago. </p> <p>At first business went well but then he began receiving hoax orders for take-away meals and recently events took a more ugly turn. He has to suffer drunks from a nearby public house urinating against the restaurant and shouting abuse at his customers. </p> <p>Racially motivated attacks have become all too common as Ireland tries to come to terms with its sharp rise in immigrants. Research conducted for the Irish Refugee Council shows that prejudice is also evident in encounters with the police and welfare officers. </p> <p>The anti-racism package has been welcomed as an attempt to initiate a campaign of education. But groups with experience of dealing with refugees say resources over a whole range of services are needed to enable immigrants to access an equal place in society. </p> <p>The number of people applying for asylum has increased sharply. It is running at 1,000 a month but only just over 500 a month are being processed. The backlog has now reached 13,000, compared with 9,000 less than a year ago. </p> <p>Immigration is a relatively new problem for Irish people who, in the past, were better known for their own efforts to seek a better life abroad. The recent success of the economy has made Ireland much more attractive to people fleeing poverty and persecution in their own countries. A stroll down any street in Dublin provides evidence that Ireland is well on the way to becoming a multi-racial society but the official reaction to this challenge has been one of fear and suspicion. </p> <p>The policy of dispersal - housing refugees away from large cities - has been ill-prepared. Local communities, often in small rural villages, have not been properly consulted and the resources needed for extra places in local schools and the provision of health services have been inadequate. </p> <p>A recent statement from the Irish Medical Organisation highlighted the difficulties experienced by doctors, particularly GPs, when refugees arrive in their surgeries speaking no English and unable to explain their previous medical history. Some are severely traumatised and need counselling as well as medical treatment. One doctor described trying to treat a patient by telephoning an interpreter in Dublin who translated what he said to the man, and vice versa. </p> <p>The reaction of local communities depends on the quality of leadership available, usually coming from the Catholic Church. Some groups provide language classes, legal advice and most importantly moral support. But there are problems that can only be solved by government. What most refugees want is to be allowed to work, but they are, for the most part, severely constrained from doing so while their applications are being processed. Trade unions and employers are united in pointing out that Ireland's successful economy is crying out for workers and that it would make sense to integrate immigrants into the workforce, rather than allow them to become a focus for popular resentment because they are perceived as 'sponging off the state.' </p> <p>There has been some progress. Two equality Bills, which ban discrimination in employment and the provision of services, are now law. This month a Dublin bus driver was convicted under the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act but this was the first conviction under a law which has been on the statute books for 11 years. </p> <p>This was an important ruling but it also demonstrates that tough, anti-discrimination laws are of no use unless there is a political will to enforce them.</p> <p><b>Useful Link</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/racism/\">Special report: race issues in the UK</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> Lincoln: a Foreigner's Quest</strong><br>Jan Morris<br>Penguin \u00a37.99, pp224<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502157028,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>When Jan Morris travelled around America back in the 1950s, Abraham Lincoln was everywhere. His sober image adorned advertising bill boards as well as legal tender. The frontier values supposedly represented by the sixteenth President, such as honest hard labour, the pioneering spirit, the triumph of the common man, were celebrated in both primary-school classes and in serious biographical studies. As it turned out, the power of Lincoln as an American icon was soon to wane, but Morris was both repulsed and intrigued by the nationalist cant. </p> <p>For those, like me, who visited America for the first time in the late 1980s it would not be the hang-dog features of Lincoln greeting them at airports and bus terminals, but the Technicolor grin of Ronald Reagan. Hard to imagine an American hero less like Lincoln, or an era less concerned with the value of 'honest, hard labour', yet the country was still steeped in the same defensive self-congratulation. </p> <p>In Morris's personal look at the Lincoln story, she tackles the foundations of the modern American dream with just this sort of scepticism. There is no gratuitous disrespect, but humorous and disruptive comment leaps from every page. Far from venerating the kind of wise and slow-speaking Midwesterner typified by Lincoln, Morris admits they are just the sort she would least like to find herself next to on a long-haul flight. </p> <p>But in the end, Lincoln himself rises untarnished, stove-pipe hat intact, from all the hogwash that is talked about him. Morris can't help both liking and admiring him and she communicates this easily, as well as giving a true picture of his background, with her naughty, breezy style. After all, Lincoln's vision of America is important, even when the reality falls down on the promise.</p>",
  "<p>It was the moustache that told you everything you needed to know. The moment you saw the thing on Rupert Pupkin's upper lip in The King Of Comedy , you knew he was a man who thought he was funny but wasn't. More than that, he was convinced of what a tragedy it would be if the world was robbed of his comic gifts. Scorsese's 1983 classic about a man who wants his shot at fame so badly he'll kidnap his idol is brilliant and funny, yet scary. At the time, people thought the film was a step back from Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. These days, it is possible to argue that The King Of Comedy tackles the same territory as Taxi Driver but more effectively. But what you never foresaw coming out of the film was that Robert De Niro would have the most financially rewarding times of his career in mainstream comedies co-starring Saturday Night Live 's comic veterans. Still less that he would one day share the screen with a cartoon squirrel and moose duo. </p> <p>Nevertheless, there he is in The Adventures Of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle, seeking world domination as the evil, monocled Fearless Leader in the movie adaptation of a surprisingly sophisticated kids cartoon from the Sixties that is little known this side of the Atlantic. Despite the cast (Rene Russo, Jason Alexander, Billy Crystal), it seems as likely to take off over here as a Captain Pugwash film sweeping America. </p> <p> Meet The Parents is a different matter. It has brought sweet relief to a movie industry that was experiencing severe autumn doldrums. The set-up is undeniably old-fashioned: a nervous young man (Ben Stiller) is trying to ask his girlfriend's intimidating father (De Niro) for her hand in marriage. </p> <p>Naturally, everything goes wrong as Stiller trips himself with untruths of spiralling insanity, which isn't wise when the man you are trying to impress has a lie detector handy. Neatly assembled by Austin Powers director Jay Roach, it keeps the jokes coming fast and stays almost schmaltz-free. And it has cleaned up at the box office, securing the number one spot three weeks running and heading comfortably for the critical $100 million mark. Coming after the success of Analyze This, it means De Niro, at 57, is suddenly a bankable film star for the first time. And although he has plenty of big dramatic roles in the pipeline, De Niro has admitted he is in the market for more comedies. </p> <p>That's another thing: these days, De Niro will talk the press. Not often, and when he does, he is still pretty reticent. But it is a start. At least now we know that Abbott And Costello Meet Frankenstein was a formative influence on his sense of humour. Stranger still, he is willing to do contrived magazine photo shoots. It seems he is finally unravelling the mystique he built for himself, one that backfired as the movies got worse and people decided his silence wasn't due to preserving a sense of mystery or privacy so much as truculence or plain dullness. </p> <p>Both Meet The Parents and Analyze This play on the De Niro persona. Analyze This, where he plays a troubled mob boss confessing all to shrink Billy Crystal, is a more direct parody of De Niro past. Meet The Parents just needs us to know, from the moment he appears on screen, that this will be a very intense man. And so it turns out. Equally importantly, De Niro is clearly comfortable working with Billy Crystal and Ben Stiller. Considering both what sort of man and actor De Niro seemed in the late Seventies and early Eighties, his current, self-mocking attitude is an interesting development. </p> <p>Dig a little deeper, and it turns out that comedy Bob predates mythical Seventies method madness De Niro. Almost unrecognisably round-faced and initially credited as Robert Denero, he got his start in a trio of films (The Wedding Party, Greetings and Hi, Mom!) directed by Brian De Palma (the idea that De Palma specialised in comedies back then is even weirder than De Niro's involvement). The first film he was in that involved the Mafia was a comedy called The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight, 28 years before Analyze This. That all changed when he established himself with Mean Streets and The Godfather: Part II. In the late Seventies, it would have been deemed almost insulting to ask De Niro to use his total immersion techniques for mere comedy. These days he is eager to reclaim the humourous edge to those roles. ' Taxi Driver: there's a lot of funny stuff in it. Really,' he insisted recently. </p> <p>No doubt some eager film student is writing a thesis joining the dots between Abbott and Costello and Travis Bickle right now. Still, during the decade of his pomp (1973's Mean Streets to 1984's Once Upon A Time In America) De Niro appeared in nothing that could be classified as a comedy. Which made it all the more surprising when he popped up briefly in Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985). That seemed to launch De Niro's second comedy era, which produced one fine film (Midnight Run) and a notorious turkey (We're No Angels). Midnight Run remains the most underrated film of De Niro's career: in many ways, it's the least mannered performance he has ever given and proved once and for all that De Niro could be funny. Unfortunately, it was followed by We're No Angels. The match-up of De Niro with Sean Penn (and a script by David Mamet) looked enticing on paper but turned out to be a disaster. De Niro went back to interspersing Scorsese reunions (Goodfellas, Casino) with performances in films such as Backdraft and Frankenstein that belied De Niro's reputation as the greatest actor of his generation. One exception was the unsung Mad Dog And Glory in 1993, where De Niro and the masterful Bill Murray rubbed up effectively against each other. In the Nineties, De Niro's attempts to stretch himself were mainly involved trying to show his softer side in the likes of Awakenings and Marvin's Room. But the most his work in those films ever got him was a rather automatic admiration. </p> <p>It was another David Mamet script, for the political satire Wag The Dog, that refloated De Niro's comedy career. De Niro plays it straight, leaving Dustin Hoffman to indulge in unrestrained hamming. Wag The Dog still had the aura of a serious project about it. It was in Analyze This that it became clear he was committed to his comedy reinvention. The film may have been essentially lightweight, but it did the business. That De Niro produced both Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle and Meet The Parents shows he wasn't taking on the roles just for a quick payday. </p> <p>Not that he has stopped doing the serious parts. On its way to us is Flawless, a curiosity in which a bigoted security guard (De Niro) recovering from a stroke befriends a transsexual (Philip Seymour Hoffman). And there is Men Of Honor, in which a bigoted naval diving instructor learns to respect a courageous young black recruit (Cuba Gooding Jr). Whatever else De Niro has managed to come to terms with recently, quality control remains a problem. </p> <p>How much De Niro has really changed recently is hard to tell, simply because we continue to know so little about him. The shift in comedy seems a sharp move, especially since the gilt came off his icon a long time ago. Not only are the bulk of films De Niro appeared in the Eighties and Nineties forgettable if not downright bad, they make you question how good he really was in the good films. That is not to say that Raging Bull isn't a great film, but that Scorsese built his movies carefully around De Niro's limitations. And the extremes of method acting probably never added anything on screen, they just made for good stories. So it is probably healthier that he now seems to regard himself as a working actor, rather than conducting a continuing experiment in changing personalities. And that he can poke fun at his own legend. Which is why De Niro himself, and not just his accountant, is probably happier now he has gone from The King Of Comedy to being the king of comedy. </p> <p><strong> Comic timing: how Bob learnt to smile </strong> </p> <p><strong> Wag the Dog (1997) </strong> </p> <p>When the President is compromisingly caught with a girl scout, a ruthless spin doctor (De Niro) is called in to bury the story by whatever means including faking a war.

  "<p>No matter how you dress it up, the bare facts are that we have to get a meal on the table for several people virtually every day of the year. Or, to be more accurate, several meals and snacks and treats and parties and, just now and again, we might like to have some friends round, too. No matter how much we like cooking and putting food out for others, it is still an unstoppable roller coaster of food, plates, pots and pans - and appetites. When one meal finishes we must start thinking about the next. And the next, and the next and the next. And there's more. We now need to consider the long-term implications of everything we put in our family's mouths; the likes and dislikes of everyone we are cooking for (a nightmare in itself); and cope with the nagging thought, 'Am I doing enough?' </p> <p>We alone know our own families, what they want, need, like and love. We know what they will wolf down uncomplainingly and when we may have to resort to what amounts to a softly-softly attempt at force-feeding. We alone know how far we are prepared to go to please them (answer: as far as we have to and further still). If I paint a somewhat bleak picture, I don't mean to: I mean only to be practical and to bring balance to the rose-tinted cookie-cutter images of family cooking given elsewhere. One thing I am sure of: every bone in my body believes that you should not try to force a child to eat something that he or she does not like. I say this having been one of those children who was forced to eat what my parents thought was good for me. </p> <p>Cooking for the family is more, much more, than simply getting a meal on the table for ourselves. It can and should be much more rewarding (though in truth it rarely feels like it). We can get an even bigger buzz out of it. Yet feeding others on a daily basis is different - we cannot skip supper or open a bottle of wine in lieu. We cannot (quite) put pasta on the table every night. </p> <p>I offer a few practical points here. You can find the cookie-cutter stuff elsewhere. </p> <p>\u0095 It will be easier for everyone if you get the whole family used to expecting the same food as soon as possible. I don't mean inflexibly so (we are surely past that now), but I do think there is much to be said for introducing what are considered 'adult' tastes into children's food as soon as possible. Why grate Cheddar to go on kids' pasta when they are going to have to get used to Parmesan sooner or later? Why introduce them to something that tastes skew-whiff when we are only going to have to put it right at some point anyway? </p> <p>\u0095 Most of us, I expect, don't even want to imagine a life without pasta - especially those of us with children. Whatever the xenophobic meat-'n'-two-veggists say, pasta is now our national dish. The family no longer unites over a joint of beef. It unites over a bowl of pasta. For the sake of all-round peace and harmony, I think it sensible to make the most of this. </p> <p>\u0095 If noses are ever turned up at one type of pasta, then try another shape. This may sound simplistic, but I know my heart used to sink when I was presented with macaroni, while penne (those short, nib-shaped sticks) has always filled me with delight. Noodles are a joy beyond belief (you can even make a silly noise while slurping them up from the bowl), yet they are possibly the messiest way there is to feed a family. </p> <p>\u0095 Nothing sticks to the floor quite like spaghetti with tomato sauce and Parmesan. </p> <p>\u0095 If the entire family likes pasta, you can bet that they will also like rice, potato-based meals and even couscous. All are equally beige and becalming. I mean this in the nicest possible way. All provide a bland and satiating base to which you can add other favourite ingredients and serve with the same bountiful earth-mother generosity as a giant bowl of pasta pesto. </p> <p>\u0095 In winter, a huge cauldron of bean and vegetable soup is something you can dip into and heat up in small quantities any time someone comes in cold and hungry and wanting something 'big' to eat. There is something of the feel-good factor about being the person with the overflowing ladle. </p> <p>\u0095 Introduce the family to your own spaghetti bolognaise before they start to get a taste for the ready-made stuff. </p> <p>\u0095 Get the kids cooking - or at least helping you out a bit - as soon as they show even the slightest interest in the kitchen. </p> <p>\u0095 No matter how much time it may save, don't serve up yesterday's leftovers when you come in from work. You will only feel wretched. Better to cook no more than you need of most things, except mash and boiled potatoes, which make great potato cakes and saut\u00e9ed potatoes - and are often better than they were the first time round. </p> <p>\u0095 Despite the depression that most leftovers bring to the table, I have never found a cold roast has the same effect. There is something quite cheering about finding enough cold meat left on a joint to make a sandwich or a salad. The trick is to bring it to room temperature rather than serve it straight from the fridge, and to add a fresh, pungent sauce and a groovy, knife-sharp salad. Try piquant sauce and some rocket leaves, and thinly shaved Manchego cheese. </p> <p>\u0095 It is worth remembering those dishes that do improve overnight, such as curry, stew and braised lamb. Cook them when you are in the mood and have the time, perhaps at the weekend, then refrigerate them for a night or two, bringing them out for a slow, thorough reheat one evening when you are feeling particularly exhausted. Forty-eight hours in the cool will do wonders for lamb braise and oxtail stew, for example. </p> <p>\u0095 No one can convince me that children do not like strong flavours. I know I did. Think of the tastes children enjoy: tomato ketchup, flavoured crisps, Marmite. They are all incredibly powerful flavours. How can we say olives are too strong for children when they will happily eat a bag of salt-and-vinegar crisps? Children who quail at the idea of garlic are often happy to tuck into your spaghetti bolognaise. In other words, the idea of garlic is often more frightening than the real thing. We just have to start them early enough - though we should probably abandon any attempts at getting them to eat capers. </p> <p>\u0095 Pudding is not essential and I don't think it is a habit we want to get into every day. Fruit is fine if it is ripe and luscious enough. And if you are very good you can have some ice cream, too. </p> <p>\u0095 I see no reason why we can't resort to a little bribery to get children to try something new. I mean, who hasn't occasionally found themselves trading off the odd forkful of something green and healthy for a spoonful of something more appealing? For the record, you get one small ball of Ben &amp; Jerry's for six forkfuls of spring greens. But no amount of bribery on earth would get me to like eggs when I was a child, and I still dislike them to this day. What I shall never know is whether I might have grown to like them had they not been forced down me by a well meaning but ultimately foolish parent. </p> <p>\u0095 I have always been a lone cook, finding 'help' in the kitchen more trouble than it's worth. OK, so I can't delegate, but I do rope people in to help peel the spuds, pull currants from their stalks and top-and-tail gooseberries. The kind of company I do like in the kitchen is someone who stands and gossips while I cook, and keeps the glasses topped up. But it is always nice to be asked if you need a hand. </p> <p><strong>An earthy, meal-in-a-bowl-type soup</strong></p> <p>Deep, dark, bass notes here. One of those swamp-like soups that gives much in the way of sustenance and warmth. I have offered this at big lunches for friends - a vast, bubbling cauldron of it, setting it down among the bread and cheese. Enough for 4 as a main course. </p> <p><strong> 2 small onions or 1 large one </strong><br> <strong> olive oil </strong><br> <strong> 3 or 4 cloves of garlic </strong><br> <strong> a good handful of diced unsmoked bacon or pancetta </strong><br> <strong> a small bunch of flat-leafed parsley </strong><br> <strong> a good 2 handfuls (250g) of green or brown lentils - maybe Puy or Castelluccio </strong><br> <strong> about a litre of stock or water - enough to cover the lentils completely </strong><br> <strong> 2 or 3 big handfuls of spinach </strong><br> <strong> a lemon </strong><br> <strong> a small bunch of mint - leaves only </strong></p> <p> Peel the onions and chop them quite finely, then let them cook over a moderate to low heat with a little olive oil, the peeled and sliced garlic and the diced bacon. You want all to be golden and fragrant. Chop the parsley and stir it in. </p> <p>Wash the lentils thoroughly and pick them over for little stones, then stir them into the onions and bacon. Pour over the stock or water and bring to the boil, skimming off any froth that appears on the surface. You can add a bay leaf or two if you like. Turn the heat down so that the lentils simmer merrily, then almost cover the pot with a lid and leave until they are tender but far from collapse - about 30 minutes, depending on the age of your lentils. </p> <p>Wash the spinach very thoroughly and tear it up a bit. While it is still wet and dripping, put it into a shallow pan over a high heat and shut the lid tightly - you want it to cook in its own steam. After a minute or so, it will be limp and bright emerald green. Lift it out, squeeze it dry (I do this by pressing it against the side of the pan with a draining spoon), then divide it between four warm bowls. </p> <p>Season the soup with salt, black pepper, lemon juice and the torn mint leaves, tasting it as you go. Ladle the hot soup on top of the spinach and serve with more lemon and mint for those who want it. </p> <p><strong>And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong> Haricot and tarragon soup </strong><br> Soak 250g of dried haricots overnight, then simmer them in unsalted water for 30 minutes. Drain and add to the onions and bacon. Continue as in the lentil soup above, but obviously without the lentils. Instead of mint, try tarragon leaves, but add them earlier, say 15 minutes or so before the soup is due to be ready. There is no need to offer more herbs at the table, but the lemon juice will still be welcome, as will some lovely crusty bread. </p> <p> <strong> Cannellini and chilli soup </strong><br> Soak and cook the beans as in the haricot and tarragon soup above but this time add a couple of seeded and chopped fresh red chillies to the onions and bacon. Serve with a slick of olive oil floating on top, plus the lemon and the mint. </p> <p> <strong> Lentil soup with celery and mushrooms </strong><br> Add a stalk or two of celery, finely diced, to the onions and garlic in the basic recipe above. Some button mushrooms, cut into quarters, can be added just before the lentils, so that they colour and sweeten. They will add even more earthy notes to the soup. You may need a little more lemon. </p> <p> <strong> Lentil and bok choi soup </strong><br> Spinach leaves are not the only greens. Use any of the Chinese leaves, such as bok choi, mustard greens or Chinese broccoli. Don't be tempted to try this with the tarragon mentioned in the haricot soup above. It won't sit comfortably. </p> <p> <strong> Other good things to add to the basic soup </strong> <br>Worcestershire sauce; mushroom ketchup (or mushroom seasoning as it is called nowadays); dark soy - stir it in at the end of cooking; a wine glass of Madeira (fabulous) about 15 minutes before the soup is due to be ready; crushed, dried chillies added with the onions and garlic; a few florets of broccoli instead of the spinach - too healthy-sounding, I know, but it is just brilliant if you have used the purple-sprouting sort. </p> <p><strong>A cheap spaghetti supper</strong></p> <p> It's not just that this is a cheap supper but that it is put together from things we tend to have knocking around anyway. Its practical, almost puritan background is a bonus. The point is that crisp bacon and breadcrumbs work brilliantly with the long strings of pasta. It makes a change to have pasta without a sauce. A few glugs of oil at the end are lubricant enough. You can safely use any of the thin pasta family here instead of spaghetti: tagliatelle, tagliarini, fettuccine or linguine. I have used the wide, floppy ribbons of pappardelle before now. They all work. Try to get a mixture of breadcrumb sizes, they are more interesting to eat. </p> <p>Per person:</p> <p><strong> 2 thickish slices of white bread - crusts removed </strong><br> <strong> a thick handful (about 125g) of spaghetti </strong><br> <strong> a thick slice of butter </strong><br> <strong> olive oil </strong><br> <strong> 2 good-sized rashers of streaky bacon </strong><br> <strong> a small bunch of parsley - leaves only, roughly chopped </strong></p> <p> Whiz the bread to rough crumbs in a food processor, or grate it by hand. It won't hurt at all (in fact it will be a bonus) if some of the crumbs are on the large side. Put a big pan of water on to boil, salt it generously and shove in the pasta. Let it cook for about 8 or 9 minutes, till it is tender but chewy. </p> <p>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan with a little olive oil to stop it burning. Cut the bacon into short pieces and fry it in the butter till its fat is golden and the kitchen smells wonderful. Scoop the bacon out with a slotted spoon into a large, warm serving bowl. Add a bit more butter and oil to the butter and bacon fat in the pan and tip in the breadcrumbs. Stir them from time to time in the sizzling butter till they have turned a rich gold. You need to keep an eye on them because they appear as if they are never going to brown, and then suddenly they're almost black. </p> <p>Drain the pasta and toss it with the hot crumbs and any of their butter, the bacon and the parsley, and a little olive oil to moisten and flavour. </p> <p><strong>And more:</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Spaghetti with bacon, breadcrumbs and garlic </strong> <br> Crush a clove of garlic per person into the butter before you fry the crumbs. </p> <p> <strong> And with chillies </strong> <br> Crushed, dried chillies seem to work better here than fresh. The quantity depends on your heat threshold but start with a fat pinch or two per person, stirring them in with the crumbs. </p> <p> <strong> And with lemon and thyme </strong> <br> Remove fine, young thyme leaves from their stalks and add them to the pan with the bacon. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the bowl as you toss everything together. </p> <p> <strong> Thin pasta with anchovies and parsley </strong> <br> Chop two or three anchovy fillets per person and cook them in a little olive oil over a low heat with a small handful of chopped parsley and a couple of cloves of finely chopped garlic. When the garlic is soft and pale gold - the anchovies will have almost melted - tip into a warm serving bowl, then continue with the crumbs as in the blueprint above. A pinch or two of dried crushed chillies, added with the anchovies, goes well here, too. </p> <p> <strong> With roast tomatoes and basil </strong> <br> Toss any of the thin pasta here with some roast tomatoes. I think it worth squashing them a little, and including their seedy juices. Basil leaves, torn to shreds, and some black pepper will produce a heady, sweet-sharp supper. There is nothing to stop you shaking some toasted crumbs over at the end if you fancy. </p> <p> <strong> And with butter and Parmesan </strong><br> For each person grate 60g Parmesan or pecorino. I know this will look like a lot but generosity is the only route to take here. Toss the hot pasta with a thick slice of your freshest butter (you really should open a new packet for this, as the sweetness of the butter is the whole point) and the grated cheese. The two will melt into a thin sauce that will lightly coat the spaghetti. Spoon over more cheese at the table - or on the floor or the sofa or in bed or wherever else you may be eating this. </p> <p><strong>Really juicy, spicy meatballs</strong></p> <p> Do you ever get an urge for food that is deeply savoury, citrus and fiery? I find the pork, lime leaves and chillies that are so much a part of Thai and Vietnamese cooking will usually do the trick. The citrus and chillies turn up in noodle soups, but sometimes the savour I want can only come from meat. These meatballs, which I often drop into a savoury chicken broth, may well be what you are after. </p> <p><strong> a handful of smoked bacon or pancetta </strong><br> <strong> 500g minced pork </strong><br> <strong> groundnut oil </strong></p> <p>For the seasoning: </p> <p><strong> 2 shallots or 4 small spring onions </strong><br> <strong> 3 or 4 small, hot, red chillies </strong><br> <strong> a small bunch of coriander </strong><br> <strong> 4 lime leaves or 2 thick stalks of lemon grass </strong><br> <strong> 3 or 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed </strong></p> <p> Chop the shallots or spring onions finely, then chop the chillies even finer, first removing the seeds if you don't like things too hot. Scrub the roots of the coriander and chop them and the leaves finely, discarding the stems. Roll the lime leaves up and shred them finely, then chop them; if you are using lemon grass, discard the coarse outer leaves, then chop the tender inside leaves very thinly. All this can be done in a food processor. </p> <p>Chop the bacon or pancetta and add it, with the seasoning above, to the minced pork. Mix in a good pinch of salt, then cover with clingfilm (otherwise it will taint everything in your fridge) and leave to rest and chill for half an hour or more. </p> <p>Shape the seasoned pork into small balls. The size is up to you. If you flatten them slightly you will get more of that delectable savoury crust when you fry them. I tend to start with a ball of mince the size of a walnut in its shell, then flatten it slightly. To cook them, you will need to warm a little oil in a heavy frying pan, then lay the meatballs in - without crowding them - and let them colour enticingly on both sides before turning the heat down a bit and letting them cook all the way through. You should find them done after four or five minutes. Test one by breaking it open: the centre should be juicy but not especially pink. </p> <p> <strong>And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong> A European version </strong><br> Perhaps you are after something savoury without the chilli rush. Make and cook the balls as above.</p> <p><strong> a handful of smoked bacon or pancetta </strong><br> <strong>500g minced pork </strong><br> <strong>groundnut oil </strong></p> <p>For the seasoning: </p> <p><strong>a couple of plump and juicy cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed </strong><br> <strong>fontina - or other easy-melting cheese such as Gruy\u00e8re, roughly diced </strong><br> <strong>the grated zest of 1 medium-sized unwaxed lemon </strong><br> <strong>a palmful of leaves of thyme, chopped </strong></p> <p> <strong>And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong> Meatballs in a hot, refreshing broth </strong><br> A hot, herbal, citrus-chilli supper. One of my favourite things to eat involves serving the Thai-inspired meatballs in a hot, herb-scented chicken broth. You will need some good chicken stock - about a large cupful per person, and I really think it should be home-made but I suppose bought stuff will do (sometimes it just has to). Bring it to the boil with a smashed stalk of lemon grass or a couple of lime leaves and a couple of chopped red chillies, then let it simmer for a few minutes while you fry the meatballs. Drop them into a deep soup bowl, strain over the fragrant, piping-hot stock, then stir in some chopped mint leaves and some basil or coriander. </p> <p> <strong> And in a mild, consoling one </strong><br> If you have made the Euro-version with cheese and thyme, you can still turn the meatballs into a substantial soup-supper by using the same chicken broth but flavoured with lots of chopped, vivid green parsley instead of the lemon grass and chillies. </p> <p> <strong>A sponge pudding with its own sauce</strong></p> <p> I believe passionately in the power of sweet, homely puddings to cure all manner of ills. Warm, nannying, becalming. Tucking into a dairy-rich hot pudding is, I am sure, the adult version of breastfeeding. To have some such pudding recipes to hand can prove endlessly useful, especially the good-natured ones like this, where a few grams either way matters less than is usual with baking. I am not sure you will want anything too sturdy to precede this, unless you are in the depths of winter. Enough for 6.</p> <p><strong> 100g butter </strong><br> <strong> 175g caster sugar </strong><br> <strong> 1 lemon </strong><br> <strong> 2 medium-sized oranges </strong><br> <strong> 4 eggs </strong><br> <strong> 40g plain flour </strong><br> <strong> 400ml milk </strong></p> <p> Cream the butter and sugar together until they are light and fluffy and the colour of finest double cream. It is easiest to do this is in a food mixer, though you could do it by hand if your butter is soft and you are feeling athletic. Set the oven at 180 C/Gas 4. </p> <p>Grate the zest from the lemon, making sure none of the bitter white pith comes with it, then cut the fruit in half and squeeze the juice. Do the same with the oranges. </p> <p>Separate the eggs and add the yolks to the creamed butter and sugar. The mixture will curdle but I wouldn't let it worry you. Now add the flour and milk alternately, the mixer on slow to medium, so you end up with a soft, cake-like batter. Stir in the orange and lemon zest and then the juice. </p> <p>Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks with an electric beater, then fold them carefully, so as not to knock out the air, into the batter. Scrape into a heatproof mixing bowl or souffl\u00e9 dish so that the mixture comes about halfway up the sides. Stand the basin in a roasting tin half-filled with hot water, then carefully transfer it to the oven. Bake for an hour or so, until the top is puffed and golden - press it with your finger to test; it should feel spongy - cool for five minutes before serving. </p> <p> <strong>And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong> A lemon pudding </strong><br> Drop the oranges in favour of another two medium-sized lemons. If they are particularly juicy you may only need one. </p> <p> <strong> A chocolate pudding </strong><br> Into a large bowl put 150g self-raising flour, 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, 200g light soft brown sugar, 100g roughly chopped fine, dark chocolate, 200ml milk, a large knob of butter, melted, and a beaten egg. Mix well. Pour into a buttered pudding basin. Mix together 75g dark soft brown sugar, 75g golden caster sugar and 100g cocoa powder and scatter it on top. Pour in 400ml of almost boiling water. Put the pudding in a roasting tin of hot water and bake for 35-40 minutes at 180 C/Gas 4. </p> <p> <strong> A chocolate hazelnut pudding </strong><br> Add 50g finely chopped hazelnuts to the ingredients above. </p> <p> <strong> To serve </strong><br> The tartness of the lemon and orange puddings and the obscene richness of the chocolate version are cooled by the addition of double cream. Serve it by the jugful. The idea is that it merges lusciously with the pudding's intense, integral sauce. * </p> <p>\u0095 Visit <a href=\"http://www.nigelslater.co.uk\">www.nigelslater.co.uk</a> - recipes are updated daily.</p>",
  "<p>My current favourite fantasy is that I buy a certain field, put back the hedges that once quartered it, then plant up the resulting four fields with apples. One of these little sheltered fields would be an orchard with cookers, another with dessert apples, another with dual-purpose trees, and the fourth would have cider apples. Each orchard would be about three acres big with around 100 trees, reaching a slow maturity with free trunks 6ft tall and spaced seven paces apart in each direction. Unlike a modern orchard, where the trees grow in stunted rows like swollen gooseberry bushes, these would be real trees, each capable of bearing hundreds of pounds of apples in maturity. It seems that this combination of the kind of large space that only a tiny handful of gardens can afford with the human proportion of a small field filled with apple trees growing as wide as they are high is the perfect summation of cultivated land. </p> <p>Of course, this doesn't fit with the trend for stunted trees for small gardens, or ballerina trees growing in pots less like ballerinas than Giacometti spinsters, or the honourable training of trees to fit confined spaces as espaliers, cordons or fans. All these things are fine, but none will do. Orchards are the real thing, the marvels in the garden. </p> <p>I had my first orchard in Hackney. I hardly knew what I was doing - which is a great advantage when it comes to getting things done - but made for a wasted opportunity. We grew six apple trees in our garden, although I can't remember which types they were, aside from the Egremont Russet. </p> <p>I don't think I was aware of rootstocks. Consequently, they were a mixed lot of various sizes, but I stuck them in the ground, staked them and they grew and bore lovely blossom, which, in the main, flourished into fruit. Daffodils grew around their base and a little lawn was held within their curtilage. It was a good place to be. No garden has a higher purpose than that. It is irrelevant what the place is composed of as long as it is a good place to be, with all the metaphysical and psychological concomitants of that. For most of us that amounts to a seat in a sunny spot or a bend in the path, but it is invariably the hub of the garden, the reason for it. </p> <p>If you have 20ft square, then you have the room for an orchard and this becomes a field full of trees, a hidden retreat and garden. The starting point is to choose the right rootstock. This is the important part of choosing an apple tree. The box describes what rootstocks are and how to choose a suitable one for your garden. It is not just trees of course. Apple trees without apples are unconsummated. And apples are not just fruit or pudding. They inspire devotion and obsession in the same way that wine or cheese do. I am the least collectable of men, but am bewitched by apples and apple trees. I'm writing this eating a Chivers Delight, a small, orange, twang of hard-edged sweetness, and would forgo all other fruit rather than apples. I line up our 36 varieties like a child with dinky toys, weigh them up in the hand, then sniff them. I possess them. </p> <p>So choose your varieties with care, and forget Cox's Orange Pippin. They are a nightmare to grow, being weedy, scabby, ugly trees that only sporadically bear fruit. When they do, the result is a dream, but you can do better. My current favourite is Ribston Pippin, but you must choose your own. </p> <p>Now is the perfect time to eat your way to your own ideal apple tree. There are more than 2,000 varieties you could grow and at least 100 of those are available from a range of nurserymen. So don't grow the banal stuff from the supermarket, and plant yourself a treat rather than a supply. If you have space for more than one variety, stretch the season out. The first apples, such as Discovery or Tydeman's Early or Worcester, will ripen in August, whereas Sturmer Pippin won't until November. But, if you want a spread of ripening times, you will also have a spread of blossom and, as no apple is reliably self-fertile, each tree will need a pollinator, so make sure that each tree is accompanied by another apple from the same group so that they can cross-pollinate each other. What this means in practise is that an Egremont Russet (group 2) is unlikely to cross-pollinate with King of the Pippins (group 5), but Ribston Pippin, Rev Wilkes and George Cave will all do fine in conjunction with it. Don't be neurotic about this as neighbouring groups tend to pollinate each other and a good rule of thumb is that if there is another apple tree within 100ft, in flower the same time as yours for at least three days, then you should get fruit. But not every year. Many apples are biennial, which in practise means they alternate between good and bad crops. Some fruit will be scabby and others have bitterpit, and the earwigs and wasps and moths will have their day. But that is an important part of their pomaceous charm. </p> <p> <strong> Rootstocks</strong> </p> <p> It is worth trying to understand rootstocks, because it is the controlling factor in the growth and eventual size of the tree. Every apple tree is grown by grafting a bud from the named variety, which will dictate the fruit that is produced, on to different roots chosen for the desired size and vigour of the mature tree. The reason for using rootstocks is that different apples have varying growth habits if attached to their own roots. Bramleys are vigorous, whereas Worcester Pearmain grows slowly and weedy. If you grew trees on their own roots it would be impossible to get suitable spacing. This is true if you grow apples from seed or cuttings, the variety is assured but the vigour unknowable. So the system has evolved where apples are grafted on to crab apple roots of known vigour. </p> <p>Until the First World War, trees were produced on 'paradise' stock, which was originally a dwarfing rootstock from France, but there was no control or classification. 'Paradise' stock from one nursery could be different from identically named rootstock from another supplier nearby. So the East Malling research station set about sorting out rootstocks. The first it produced was called Malling Type 1, which became shortened to M1. Eventually it got to M27, but only about 10 are used at all, and four are common. </p> <p>To confuse matters, another research station, the John Innes Horticultural Institution, based at Merton, also worked on rootstocks, collaborating with East Malling. The results of this work produced stocks that were named Malling Merton, or MM. So that they would not be confused with the M types, they were numbered from 100. Hence the rootstocks MM106 and MM111. </p> <p> <strong> Characteristics of common rootstocks:</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 M27 Very Dwarfing: ideal for containers, but needs rich soil and support through its life. </p> <p> \u0095 M9 Dwarfing: makes for a small tree that comes into bearing early, with early, large fruit. Has brittle roots, so needs permanent staking. Good for cordons and containers. </p> <p> \u0095 M26 Semi-dwarfing: used in commercial orchards because it produces early, large fruit. Tolerates poorer soil than M9, but is a slow starter. Needs permanent staking. </p> <p> \u0095 MM106 Semi-dwarfing: a medium tree that grows and crops well on poor soil. Suitable for semi-standards or large bush-shaped trees. Best for espalier or cordon trees in poor soils. </p> <p> \u0095 MM111 Vigorous: ideal for standard or semi-standard trees and is drought resistant. </p> <p> \u0095 M 25 Very Vigorous: suitable for large standards and produces up to 400lb of fruit. </p> <p>Plant bare-root and pot-grown trees alike into a generous hole, loosening the subsoil and adding some compost or manure. Stake the tree before planting and firm the roots in thoroughly. Water very well. Leave a wide area (at least a metre in diameter, preferably twice that) clear of growth and mulch it thickly with compost. I do not spray or treat my trees in any way other than to prune and thin at appropriate times. These are my top 10 garden dessert apples (followed by their pollinating groups in brackets): Ribston Pippin (2); Jupiter (3); Rosemary Russet (3); King of the Pippins (5); James Grieve (3); William Crump (5); Crimson Queening (3); Chivers Delight (4); Worcester Pearmain (3) and Ashmeads Kernel (4). </p> <p>While my favourite 10 culinary apples are: Devonshire Buckland (3); Arthur Turner (3); Herefordshire Beefing (4); Glory Of England (2); Reverent Wilkes (2); Newton Wonder (5); Bramley Seedling (3); Blenheim Orange (3); Peasgood Nonsuch (3); and Tom Putt (3).</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>I hurt my shoulder. I did it in August, drunkenly lifting weights at midnight. I know, it's pathetic. But there we are, the damage was done and the hurt remains. Only driving, writing with a pen or reaching for anything in bed hurts more than gardening. A couple of hours digging or planting guarantees a couple of days real discomfort. I find this depressing because it cuts out a whole tranche of life that provides happiness. The garden does not always need me, but it rams home how much I need the garden. I have always been an evangelist of muscular horticulture, digging and sweating for a personal victory. Now I potter, trying not to reach for anything with my right hand, in a constant little swamp of pain. This is often on my mind because I have been digging up all the ligularias in the Jewel garden and moving them to the new damp garden to join the hostas that I have also moved over the past few weeks.</p> <p>The 'new' damp garden has always been damp and has never been organised before, so now it is official. As with the hostas, the amazing thing was how much space the ligularias took once they were dug up and transplanted. I split the bigger clumps and left more space than they had been used to, but the transformation is dramatic. I moved them because we had found that even in the heavy soil of the Jewel garden, they only looked happy in wet weather. A day or two without rain and they would wilt and flop. In turn, this has left spaces to be filled in the Jewel garden, but a space is not a loss but an opportunity. Mainly to thin out and redistribute the various grasses that we planted far too close together to get an instant effect for last summer's American magazine that came to do a feature on the garden. </p> <p>We have had a couple of light frosts, but not enough to damage anything other than the basil and not enough to kill off the caterpillars on the brassica. I find that they always start on the green plants, like broccoli, and then move on to the purple plants like curly kale and red cabbage. I am still picking off dozens from these plants which we grow as much for aesthetic as nourishment. But it has been a good season for rocket, all of which I have grown in soil blocks for the first year and planted out, rather than sowing in rows and then thinning. But it seems to be hotter than normal. Is this the weather or the seed? By the way, I like getting email from you, (<a href=\"mailto:montydon@btclick.com\">montydon@btclick.com</a>).</p>"
