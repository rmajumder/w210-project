  "<p>The Republic of Ireland's eventful week came within a whisker of ending with a glorious triumph here in the Amsterdam Arena. </p> <p>The coach, Mick McCarthy, who banned Phil Babb and Mark Kennedy from playing in this match, must have felt his decision was fully vindicated when goals from Robbie Keane and Jason McAteer promised a staggering outcome. But it was not quite to be. Holland fought back, avoiding an embarrassing home defeat with goals by Jeffrey Talan and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, two of the most unlikely marksmen. </p> <p>A torrential downpour in the afternoon had long since given way to a near-balmy evening by the time the game kicked off, with the Republic of Ireland playing towards the goal behind which sat 7,000 of their supporters. </p> <p>Within eight minutes, Robbie Keane was displaying a hint of things to come with a spirited 50-yard dash that began when he left Frank de Boer for dead on the halfway line. Richard Dunne, Mark Kinsella and Roy Keane were all involved in the subsequent exchange of passes before Kevin Kilbane's deep left-wing cross was met by Niall Quinn beyond the far post. His header thudded against the outside of the near-upright to the relief of the majority of the crowd, most of whom were clad in orange replica shirts. </p> <p>Ireland threatened again when Stephen Carr was brought down by Giovanni van Bronckhorst on the edge of the area, but Ian Harte's free-kick carried no great danger for the Dutch. </p> <p>Holland suddenly got their act into order after Frank de Boer had found Michael Reiziger with a pinpoint cross-field pass. The full-back, who faces a Fifa sanction after his pre-match declaration on his website that Holland would try to get Roy Keane sent off, cut inside to fire just wide. As for Roy Keane, he was his usual indefatigable self, cajoling, running, tackling, and doing little to generate animosity among his opponents. </p> <p>Ireland were clearly in the middle of an uncomfortable period, however. There was an anxious moment for Harte when Ronald de Boer tumbled into the area after his challenge. The Slovakian referee waved aside Dutch appeals for a penalty. Ireland's torrid time continued but Richard Dunne managed to get his brow in the way of a goal-bound header from Frank de Boer after a corner from his twin brother. Dunne and Gary Breen were, thankfully, looking sharp in the Irish defence despite having mustered only 80 minutes of Premiership football between them this season. </p> <p>Yet it was another member of the over-worked Irish defence who started the move that led to Robbie Keane's seventh international goal. Carr extricated himself from an unpromising situation near the right corner flag to supply Jason McAteer, who promptly whipped over a cross that was met by Inter's new \u00a312 million signing with a decisive header that gave Edwin van der Sar no chance in the Dutch goal. </p> <p>Renewed confidence surged through the Irish ranks and Harte almost made it two moments later when he sped on to Kilbane's long raking pass only to fail narrowly with a cross-shot. That was more excusable than Quinn's next miss. He could only respond with a weak shot after a slip by Bert Konterman, reminiscent of his wretched contribution the previous weekend for Rangers against Celtic. </p> <p>Holland, now under the control of Louis van Gaal, were still exhibiting the same lack of penetration that proved so costly to his predecessor, Frank Rijkaard, during Euro 2000. Not until the 41st minute, when Dunne blocked a low shot from Paul Bosvelt, did they seriously threaten again. Soon afterwards Patrick Kluivert, having recovered from being dumped on his backside by Dunne near the corner flag, got too much under a cross from Ronald de Boer. Ireland once again cleared the danger but the pressure was back on at the start of the second half. </p> <p>Holland resumed with Clarence Seedorf, on for Barcelona's Reiziger, giving them extra vision and pace in midfield. By the time Van Gaal made another change on the hour, bringing on Arnold Bruggink for his first cap for Richard Witschge, who had made little impression in mid-field, Ireland had gone close again. Quinn flung himself at another cross from Kilbane but was sadly once more off target. Not so McAteer, when the Blackburn player rifled in the second Irish goal from 30 yards with his weaker left foot after a move involving Quinn and Robbie Keane. The Dutch were now seriously up against it, much to the joy of the ecstatic Irish following. </p> <p>Hearts were soon in Irish mouths, however. Talan had been on the field only six minutes as the third Dutch substitute when, with a stooping header, he scored the goal that gave Van Gaal's team a glimmer of hope. The move started when the ball ran kindly for Kluivert out on the left. The Barcelona striker, scorer of the two goals that had ended Ireland's hopes of Euro 96 qualification the last time the nations met, found Ronald de Boer, whose cross picked out Talan at the far post. The midfielder who will shortly be appearing in the Champions League for Heerenveen just beat Harte to the centre. Gary Kelly was beaten again in the 84th minute when Van Bronckhorst swerved a vicious drive into the roof of the net from fully 35 yards. </p> <p><strong> Holland </strong> Van der Sar, Reiziger (Seedorf 46), Konterman (Talan 65), F. de Boer, Van Bronckhorst, Bosvelt, R. de Boer, Witschge (Bruggink 60), Kluivert, Cocu, Bouma.

  "<p>'When I arrived in Johannesburg, I jumped into a hire car and drove up to a game reserve. As I hadn't had time to send the document back to London until I got to the reserve, I parked next to an elephant quietly eating a small tree, and emailed London.' </p> <p>No jokes about trunk calls please, this is Christopher Davis's career he's talking about. And while this sort of surfing safari is not an everyday activity, it's not atypical either. Davis is a virtual solicitor, one of a growing band of teleworkers working from home or other locations far away from their office base. He maintains contact with clients and colleagues worldwide though email, mobile phone and the internet. </p> <p>This year the number of teleworkers like Davis will hit 10 million in Europe and by 2005 the figure will comfortably exceed 16 million - more than 10 per cent of the European workforce. Finland leads the way but, with a quarter of a million new teleworkers since last spring, Britain is catching up fast. These statistics form part of a European-wide survey into teleworking to be published in London later this month at Telework 2000. </p> <p>This is the first time the European teleworking conference has been held in the UK. Peter Johnston, head of the European Commission's information society directorate, who ordered the research, will be among the speakers. He says the EC sees the promotion of teleworking as central to achieving its aim of raising the proportion of Europeans of working age in employment from 61 per cent today to 70 per cent by 2010. 'We have to hit this target if we are to fund social security and pensions in the future and teleworking removes a lot of the barriers to working - particularly for women, older people and disabled people,' he says. </p> <p>The EU is funding research into electronic methods of working to the tune of 50 million euros (\u00a331 million). 'The European Social and Regional Development funds which exist to accelerate development in less-favoured regions of the EU have also been very effective in getting teleworking schemes onstream,' says Johnston. 'Teleworking is not just about greater efficiency and productivity, it is increasingly the most effective way to improve the work-life balance, the way to stimulate creativity and the way to achieve more efficient use of office space and transport infrastructures.' </p> <p>Alan Denbigh, executive director of the TCA (the Telework and Telecentre Association) says: 'The conventional 9-5 workplace is actually unsuitable for work. The buildings are often unhealthy and there are constant interruptions.' He also believes that the traditional office environment with its fixed hours, clothing and hierarchies, all reminiscent of schooldays, is 'infantilising'. He says 'teleworkers are re-empowered and this increases productivity'. </p> <p>'Any major organisation that has still not considered flexible working is going to miss out,' says Ursula Laws of the Institute of Employment Studies. Her organisation's figures show how far teleworking has spread. She says: 'There has been an increase of 22 per cent in employees teleworking and 15 per cent in self-employed, a 12 per cent increase in clerical working despite a general decrease in the clerical workforce and a growth in financial services, the strongest of all sectors, by 34 per cent.' </p> <p>One type of business that could be revolutionised by teleworking is the call-centre, where demand for staff frequently exceeds supply. Only 4 per cent of call centre managers employ teleworkers, but 42 per cent expect to do so in the near future. Next time you break down your emergency call could well be taken by one of the 150 people working in the AA's virtual call centre. Denbigh says: 'It takes 18 months to build a call centre and a couple of weeks to set up a virtual one. Which would you choose? Teleworking reduces the overheads - there may be marginally increased technology costs but these are more than offset by savings in office space - and it increases flexibility as nobody wants to come into the office for just a couple of hours' work, but at home it's different.' </p> <p>He says manufacturers of the technology such as BT and IBM are proving through their own working practices that the technology is up to the job. One former BT employer says: 'For years BT was advocating teleworking but not doing it itself. It has realised this and now lots of BT staff work from home.' </p> <p>The teleworker's teleworker must be Volker Krieger. He lives in Germany and works for a Swiss technology corporate with customers all over Europe and Poland. 'I have at least three offices,' he says. 'Half of the time, it's my lap top which I frequently use in the car hooked up to a mobile phone, 20 per cent of the time I'm at home and 30 per cent of the time I work in one or other of our offices. About half of my work is virtual and half is physical - that is, face-to-face with the client, but that's expensive and time-consuming. I think I can reduce this to less than 20 per cent.' </p> <p>Krieger believes teleworking will become the natural way of operating. 'It's a generational thing. Today's schoolchildren will be natural teleworkers. To them using the tools of teleworking is normal not new.' </p> <p>Currently, transnational teleworking is limited but the European company statute will, when agreed by the EU countries, enable direct employer-employee relationships to be established across the national boundaries. Nevertheless, Denbigh suggests that there may be a geographical limit, at least as far as employees are concerned. 'The AA want all staff to live within 70 miles of the administration centre because of the need for meetings and supervisions.' </p> <p>However, for freelancers even the sky is not the limit. Teleworkers in the UK and Ireland working with US companies simply adjust their own hours to the working day across the Atlantic. </p> <p>Anna Brady works for a company with offices in California and New York from her flat in Dublin. 'Only one or two people in the entire company work on-site,' she says. 'The company runs newsgroups which give you an idea of the history of different projects, and of the personalities of other members of the virtual team. When I visited the US for the first time it was a surprise to see how some of these people looked in real life.' </p> <p>Never having to look at the bloke at the next desk. Now that's a reason to telework. </p> <p><strong>Pros </strong></p> <p> 1 Save time and money on travelling </p> <p> 2 More control over your work and other parts of your life </p> <p> 3 No interruptions, gossip or office politics </p> <p> 4 Improved quality of life </p> <p> 5 Greater opportunity for community involvement </p> <p> 6 Good for environment </p> <p><strong> Cons </strong></p> <p> 1 Need high degree of personal motivation </p> <p> 2 Need space to work in </p> <p> 3 More dependent on technology </p> <p> 4 Potential lack of human contact </p> <p> 5 Could be frozen out in office politics </p> <p> 6 Can never escape from the office </p> <p> 7 Less distinction between work and home </p> <p>\u0095 A new edition of 'The Teleworking Handbook' published by the Telework and Telecentre Association is available now for \u00a319.95.

  "<p>The idea that business and politics don't mix is one of management's most deeply ingrained myths. When people say of a corporation, for instance, or an NHS hospital that 'it's a very political organisation', it's not meant as a compliment. </p> <p>In the same way, 'he or she plays politics', is a damning assessment of a person. But the ideal of a company as a politics-free zone is getting harder and harder to sustain. It was born of an era where rationality and control were the paramount values, and hierarchy and bureaucracy the logical management expression of them. Unfortunately the world is no longer predictable and stable, but chaotic and volatile. </p> <p>The attempt to impose top-down solutions is more a help than a hindrance, so the simplistic vision of management as an exercise in machine-like rationality doesn't wash any more. </p> <p>Dr David Butcher, who leads executive seminars on organisational politics at Cranfield Management School, points out that as long as 50 years ago the theorist Herbert Simon described the behaviour of people in organisations as resembling 'temporary coalitions of interested parties who occasionally do things together'. </p> <p>That view was heretical then, and it is still at odds with much of the conventional theoretical account of the firm. </p> <p>Yet the Simonian notion of organisations as inherently political, says Butcher, strikes chords with managers at every level: junior executives who witness the yawning gap between espoused values such as empowerment and the unspoken command-and-control reality; middle managers who are only too conscious of finding their best ideas squashed because of political considerations; and senior executives who, the moment they reach the top, cannot avoid realising that every decision they make, whether on management appointments, the siting of a new plant or investing in a new internet venture, is political before all else. </p> <p>In fact, says Butcher, once it's accepted that business management is no longer a matter of identifying the one right solution, the parallels between 'politics' with a big 'P' and the organisational variety are greater than commonly supposed - or than the normal language of management allows. </p> <p>Both are fundamentally about resolving the clash of competing causes. In reaching this resolution, drafting white papers, canvassing interested parties, lobbying, leaks and deals in smoke-filled rooms are all part of the political game. </p> <p>But while in democratic politics everyone accepts that when a matter finally reaches Parliament it is really all over bar the shouting (sometimes literally), there is no comparable language, ritual or institution to legitimise the process in companies. The result: years of wasted management effort, frustration and eventually cynicism as decision-making obstinately refuses to obey the rational logic that managers try to impose on it. </p> <p>Treating organisations as political in this sense has far-reaching implications. For a start, it makes management a fundamentally moral activity. </p> <p>This, explains Butcher, is because any democratic political system can only function on the assumption that the competing causes are founded on good faith, not ill will or wickedness. The debate is genuine. It follows that the only difference between 'good' and 'bad' politics is the motivation of the people involved. Most ends are justified if the cause is good. 'Good' politics is about competing to bring the greatest benefits to others; including stakeholders, by definition. 'Bad' politics is what diverts people's energies into negative or self-serving ends. </p> <p>The big step, says Butcher, is to get people to accept that, far from being an aberration, politics is a legitimate and necessary activity in companies - an inevitable part of the daily work of getting things done. Some people never make that step: the shock to the conventional mindset is too great to accept. But only at that point is it possible to start to build the basic political understanding and fluency with which companies can resolve the tension between the warring 'rational' and 'irrational' sides of their decision-making. </p> <p>Once people have made the mindset switch, says Butcher, they are unlikely to switch back again to the old attitudes - although back in the real world of their companies they may have to pretend. Indeed, continuing to deliver according to the old rules of the game, while promoting a different agenda, is one of the key political competences. Others are self-knowledge, being extremely careful about where you put your trust and developing informal ways of managing upward - it's pointless, not to mention career-limiting, to stride into open battle for a good cause against an immediate boss whom you know to be hostile if you can find your way around him or her. </p> <p>Political skills are particularly important for managers in organisations that are in the throes of large-scale change. Since it puts group and individual interests at stake, change is fertile ground for all the elements of political agitation - genuine debate about the company's future options mingles with rumours, hidden agendas and jockeying for position in a vortex of speculation and coalition building. </p> <p>Of course, failure to recognise the political dimension may be one reason why companies find change notoriously hard to manage to a proper conclusion. That at least was the tentative finding of consultancy AT Kearney which, echoing the results of other studies of the same subject, in a recent survey of 300 European companies found that only 17 per cent were achieving change of the extent, timeliness and durability that they planned. </p> <p>Managers, suggests Kearney, persistently overestimate the importance of the rational, economic components of change and correspondingly underestimate the political and social. Organisations are made up of human beings, and all dimensions of their behaviour must be engaged to push change through. It's a lesson we should have learnt by now. What is politics, after all, but the art of the possible?</p>",
  "<p>Were Jason Brown a spinner of yarns rather than balls, he would make a top-notch confidence trickster. He is certainly doing his level best to fleece Gloucestershire, whom one trusts were busy last night sending emails to CelestialBody.com, pleading for a few more obliging bucketloads of the wet stuff. </p> <p>Between the torrents that virtually halved yesterday's ration, Brown and Darren Cousins, the mainsprings of the home attack, claimed four scalps apiece, enabling Northamptonshire to enforce the follow-on. Brown now has 50 wickets at 19.38 in this term's championship, at the unheard-of strike rate - for a modern English off-spinner - of 48.88 balls per wicket. </p> <p>Robert Croft's rate is twice that. Among the southpaws, Ashley Giles stands at 60.7, Phil Tufnell 68, Dipak Patel 74. Granted, Ian Salisbury strikes every 46 balls and Saqlain Mushtaq every 38, yet even Shane Warne only does so every 54. </p> <p>His side's travails did not dissuade that broad-minded coach John Bracewell from expressing his admiration for the slight fellow who has done most to put the Second Division leaders in sight of a senior league title for the first time since they took the Second-Class (now Minor) Counties crown in 1904. </p> <p>Indeed, he reckons Brown could be England's ace in the hole in next summer's Ashes' debate. </p> <p>\"Our batsmen tell me he gets lots of revs on the ball, really rips it,\" enthused Bracewell, showing due appreciation for the gifts of a fellow offie. \"What I like is his line, the way he pitches the ball well outside off, aiming to hit off. That's the right line for Ashes cricket. If there's a weakness in the Australian side, any Australian side, it's against off-spin. </p> <p>\"They always want to work you to the on side, so they're closing the face of the bat early. And they don't like waiting for the ball. Steve Waugh recently decided to take the aerial route - the size of their grounds makes them reluctant to do that - but I think this bloke has the control to cope.\" </p> <p>That said, Bracewell believes the selectors were justified in not selecting Brown for England's first tour of Pakistan since Mike Gatting clashed with Shakoor Rana. \"I don't think you can get away with doing only one thing in Test cricket now,\" he said, referring to Brown's staunchly irresolute batsmanship. Three weeks ago, he confessed that he had not had a net all season. </p> <p>Bracewell, who topped up his 104 wickets for New Zealand with 1,001 runs at 20, including a century against England, offers one worthwhile suggestion. </p> <p>\"Maybe,\" he proposes, \"he should work at being a terrific fielder.\" </p> <p>A quick chat with Roger Harper before the West Indies head off home might not be a bad idea.</p>",
  "<p>Ian Thomas enters the last three weeks of the season with a double mission: to help Glamorgan secure a place in the top tier of the championship and land himself a contract. </p> <p>The 21-year-old left-hander would appear to have every chance of achieving his goals following a highly successful day's work that seems certain to cement the Welsh county's place among the top three to be promoted from the Second Division. </p> <p>Thomas marked his championship debut with a composed 82 after Glamorgan had resumed on 360 for six. He occasionally drove with power and elegance but generally prospered by coaxing the ball into the gaps as Glamorgan totalled 507 for nine declared and earned a first-innings lead of 215. </p> <p>Thomas is currently contracted on a match-to-match basis and due to complete a Sports Development course at the University of Wales Institute, in Cardiff, next May. \"I hope I will be able to do enough to persuade the county to offer me a permanent contract,\" he said. \"No one has yet approached me to discuss such a possibility but this performance might open the door to an offer.\" </p> <p>Thomas, who has averaged around 50 for the second XI this summer, owed his elevation to the senior side to a spate of injuries which robbed them of Matthew Elliott, Adrian Shaw and Alex Wharf. But although he received a slice of luck when on 26, Ashley Cowan putting down a lofted drive after running round from long-on to long-off, he expressed disappointment at not going on to reach three figures. </p> <p>Had he done so, he would have been the first Glamorgan player to achieve the feat on his first championship appearance since Matthew Maynard landed that distinction against Yorkshire in 1985. </p> <p>Thomas was denied emulating his captain when he repeated the stroke which should have brought about his downfall earlier. On this occasion Will Jefferson was not to offer a reprieve as he held the catch just inside the long-off fence. </p> <p>Glamorgan's total was only the second time they have reached 500 against Essex, the other instance being way back in 1948. Their cause was helped by some undistinguished bowling, Danny Law too often sending down deliveries that batsmen could afford to ignore, and Ricky Anderson looking well below his best after a three-month lay-off while recovering from a broken toe. </p> <p>Glamorgan's formidable advantage left Essex facing a huge task even to salvage a draw. Even that, however, seems highly unlikely following a dismal final session, the start of which was delayed by rain. </p> <p>Paul Grayson was caught behind by Maynard - appearing behind the stumps because of Shaw's groin injury - while pushing forward, Jefferson was undone by the guile of Robert Croft and Paul Prichard, having been put down at short leg early on, became Maynard's second victim when sweeping Dean Cosker. </p> <p>Essex reached the close on 75 for three and in serious trouble. Glamorgan, meanwhile, were left scenting a victory which would greatly enhance their prospects of promotion. The two biggest obstacles to such an outcome appear to be Stuart Law and the weather - showers being forecast for today.</p>",

  "<p> \"A new era of great British production... great British production in all genres... great British programmes.\" Britishness runs like a litany through Greg Dyke's MacTaggart Lecture, reiterating the hope that the BBC's distinct national identity may continue to single it out from the dozens of other channel offerings in the digital revolution. </p> <p>Presumably Dyke means multi-ethnic Britishness, not Englishness, although the BBC's royal charter horoscope (January 1 1927) links strongly to the quintessential English national horoscope, the coronation of William the Conqueror on Christmas Day 1066. Both horoscopes have an identical Capricorn sun, making the BBC the cultural crown of the nation. Capricorn's are traditional, reserved, dutiful... the stuffy Beeb and the stiff upper lip.</p> <p>Dyke aims to make this old Capricorn Auntie \"more exciting, more gripping\", but she faces the unanswerable dilemma of justifying a licence fee in an age of commercial channels. He wants universality - free, public service broadcasting - with channel genres and a creative environment for talented people. Will his strategies work?</p> <p>Dyke's realistic, business-oriented Taurean nature (May 20 1947) peppers his lecture with talk of cash for this and cash for that. With the Gemini twins also strong, he should move deftly between public service broadcasting and commercial profit, from analogue past to digital future. </p> <p>The immediate prospects look good. The BBC has tremendous leverage with its vast programme content through pay-on-demand and IT related services. Radical changes can be expected in June 2002 when the Sun joins hi-tech Uranus, favouring creative outsider talent.</p> <p>But there's something missing. Media today has the Jupiterian role once performed by the church or the law, providing ethical and spiritual authority, but this isn't the language of modern times. Dyke's Taurean approach suggests management, not vision. To hold its archetypal place in the nation's psyche, the BBC must take this on board, with Dyke or without him. </p> <p>Email the Media Medium at: <a href=\"mailto:maggie@companyguide.co.uk\">maggie@companyguide.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>You would have to be dead not to feel just a little faint with excitement when you first catch sight of the Aurora, towering in glorious cream-and-gold livery above the heaps of containers on Southampton docks. </p> <p>The brand new Aurora may be nothing more than a 76,000 ton, \u00a3200m floating hotel, restaurant and entertainment complex with a crew of 800 catering for 1,800 passengers -but, oh, what a difference the floating makes. There is something thrilling and glamorous about being at sea, and it doesn't wear off, even after 10 days aboard. On evening three, out in the Bay of Biscay, with a gale blowing up and a swell building, we watched a Euro 2000 match on an enormous TV screen in one of the ship's umpteen bars, with stewards running about with trays of cold beers. The man on the next table said: \"Life doesn't get much better, does it?\" And no one disagreed. </p> <p><strong> Cabins</strong></p> <p> We had a cabin with twin beds and a little balcony. The cabins are not huge but they are luxury; the whole ship is luxury, but I never found a spot I liked better than our cabin. The carpets are thick, the cupboards are huge, the deck chairs on the balcony have plump cotton-covered cushions and the beds are proper hotel beds - firm, with crisp white sheets and massive pillows. Everything is well-finished and sweet-smelling. The bathroom was small, but cleverly designed with huge mirrors, a powerful shower, and two large corner cabinets. </p> <p>Then there was a sofa, coffee table and television (showing four or so videos each day, as well as live footage from the camera at the front of the ship - staff below the waterline use it to check if it's night or day, sunny or rainy). </p> <p>Each cabin has a dedicated steward (shared with 15 other cabins). We had Jerry, a man of saintly patience, who spent 10 days trailing in and out with pots of fresh decaf coffee, extra blankets and fizzy mineral water. These stewards - who are, as is traditional on P&amp;O ships, largely recruited from Goa - do up to nine months at a stretch onboard. They make most of their money - which Jerry, for one, uses to support family in Bombay - on tips (the Guide to Tipping on your dressing table advises you to leave a lump sum in an envelope at the end of the cruise). </p> <p><strong> Sea days</strong></p> <p> Cruising, Brit-style, is still largely the province of white English people of late middle-age or above, and many of the organised activities during days at sea are resolutely un-hip, if not grossly un-PC. In your morning copy of Aurora Today, the ship's newspaper, you will find Masonic meetings (\"Masonic widows should check in at reception\"), bridge classes, coffee mornings, and flower pressing. </p> <p>But none of it is compulsory. By the end of the trip, we still felt we had barely begun to take advantage of such an enormous ship. There's the beauty salon (massages, body wraps and facials, at about \u00a340 a shot), a decent gym with exercise classes (although no yoga), three pools (none large enough to do proper lengths), five-a-side football (every afternoon on sea days), a mini cricket pitch, an outdoor golf simulator (people raved about it), a big room of arcade games, a cinema and a casino. Or you can sunbathe on deck (the pristine, exquisitely-finished wooden deck) or read in the library (a beautiful room with fantastic views of the sea and big leather armchairs). Or you can just lie in bed with the sliding doors to your balcony open and the ocean rushing by. Which is pretty blissful. </p> <p><strong> Days in port</strong></p> <p> We had four days in harbour on our trip. There's a curious pleasure to waking up in the morning, opening your curtains and finding that you're no longer at sea. If the harbour is deep enough, the Aurora draws up alongside a jetty, and all you have to do is get the lift down to deck five, shove a tenner in a machine (pesetas or whatever spew out the bottom) and then trip down the gang plank. If you have to anchor out (which only happened to us in Lanzarote), you're transported ashore by tender (boats that seat about 100 at a time), which is somewhat more tedious. </p> <p>Our first port day was in Vigo, a little Spanish city; we strolled up to the castle at the top of the hill, ate some tapas in a pretty square, had a beer, then went back onboard to watch an afternoon movie. You don't have to show your passport to get on or off, only your \"cruise card\", which doubles as a credit card onboard (the ship is a cash-free zone). </p> <p>Hiring a car at the travel agents onboard is simple and dirt cheap at about \u00a320 for the day. In Lanzarote, we drove up to the island's fabulous volcanic national park - frustratingly you're not allowed to walk about and poke at the lava - and then found a beach with translucent water and white sand. In Tenerife (which is a stunning island, with gloriously jagged volcanic peaks: why does no one ever tell you that?), we drove up high and wished we could be there longer - in fact, we swore to go back. </p> <p>If you don't like doing your own thing, there are lots of organised trips. In Madeira, a much lusher island than the previous two, we went on an off-road Jeep trip up into the densely-vegetated mountains. Again, we vowed to go back - the German guide said it has the prettiest walking in Europe - although the trip itself was all driving; not enough stops and too much high-speed swerving around and bashing up and down. </p> <p>There is only one real danger with all this zero-effort travel: getting left behind. Because the Aurora waits for no man - or woman, or child. She leaves when she leaves, at the time laid down in Aurora Today. </p> <p>In Madeira, one of our fellow passengers was fortunate that the captain of the pilot boat agreed to rush him out to the ship before she had sailed too far from the jetty (this is a ship that, in an emergency-stop scenario, takes almost a mile to draw to a shuddering halt). </p> <p>The no-waiting rule goes for the crew, too; one of the Aurora's officers, resplendent in his whites (gold epaulettes, Richard Gere-style cap, the whole gig), told us that he had once left seven laundrymen behind in some port, which apparently caused no end of hassle. </p> <p><strong> Evenings</strong></p> <p> These are a big deal on Aurora; the whole point really for many passengers. You get two casual-wear evenings (during which everyone wears black tie), a couple of informal evenings (during which everyone wears black tie) and a clutch of formal evenings (during which, somehow, people seem to go a notch above black tie and no one is allowed to take their jackets off in the bars, even at 2am). The \"ladies\", as we are frequently described in Aurora Today, drip with gold and black lace, the men with dickie bows and cufflinks. </p> <p>Weather permitting, the evening begins with a lap around deck seven, the promenade deck, a perfect sunset, a glass of champagne and then a four-course supper. </p> <p>Later, you could go to the show (they have musicals, comedians, talent shows, karaoke; whatever's your bag) or a film, a late-night drink and maybe even the disco. If it's not too windy and the pools aren't spontaneously emptying themselves, the stars are fantastic out on deck. </p> <p>And all this is hugely enlivened by the Opening of External Doors Palaver - as soon as the ship's up to full speed (about 24 knots), opening a door to the deck has the same kind of impact as opening an external door on a passenger jet at 35,000ft: panic, hurricane-force winds, people in evening wear flying through the air, grappling for a hand-hold on anything that's nailed down - high drama. Then, just as abruptly, the door slams shut and all is normal again: you can only tell it ever happened by looking at your hair. </p> <p><strong> Eating</strong></p> <p> Very popular; very easy to do. Basically, you can eat at any time of day and night and it's free. If you don't want to attend the formal sittings in the two main dining rooms, you can do room service or eat in Caf\u00e9 Bordeaux, a 24-hour bistro (which is great and lets you smoke, unlike the other restaurants). During the day, there are buffets or barbecues on deck. Our favourite evening meal was an Indian buffet. </p> <p>The food's not five-star, but they don't aim for that: they aim for no complaints. That means the food is hot when it reaches the table, you can always have anything on the menu, the vegetables are crisp, the rolls are fresh, the service is matchless and there's a good wine list. </p> <p>This is catering on an industrial scale - they have a microwave below-deck that could cook a grown man in under a minute - done with great panache. </p> <p><strong> Children</strong></p> <p> There's a kids' area with its own pool and indoor adventure playground. They play games, charge about and are well shielded from any interference from adult relatives. They go to the early sitting at supper (6pm) and at night children and babies can be left in the kids' area, on a cute little line of beds, until 2am. </p> <p><strong> Seasickness</strong></p> <p> About 3% of us are particularly susceptible, apparently, but even in quite stormy seas the Aurora hardly budges. She has enormous stabilisers swivelling about just under the water on either side to steady her and you couldn't ask for a more comfortable ride. But if you do feel really grotty, there's a little hospital onboard. </p> <p><strong> Costs</strong></p> <p> The price doesn't put people off; it's not unusual to meet someone who's been on more than 40 cruises. Many people said they had managed to secure a 40% discount from Teletext or similar, and then, of course, everything on board (except alcohol, the duty-free shops and day-trips) is included, which is pretty good value if you do the posh dinner-plus-show thing every night. A gin and tonic is \u00a31.75, a bottle of champagne about \u00a320: cheaper than London, at least.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>The Guardian was a guest of P&amp;O Cruises on Aurora for a nine-night cruise from Southampton to Vigo, Lanzarote, Tenerife and Madeira. Fares were from \u00a31,375 for adults. A 12-night \"Canaries Carousel\" cruise from Southampton on December 1 costs from \u00a31,525 per adult. From January 2001, Aurora will be sailing round the world. Fares start from \u00a32,460 for 19 nights from Bombay to Southampton. Aurora returns to Southampton in April and on April 28 sails on a12-night Canaries Cruise. Prices start from \u00a31,695 per person. For a P&amp;O Cruises brochure call 0990 726726.

  "They are the stars of their league, their dazzling skills drawing fame, glory and millions of pounds in their wake. They are not footballers. They are science professors. But they are getting as hard to keep, and as eagerly poached. <p>Even by the standards of the university transfer market, yesterday's announcement that three of Oxford University's most distinguished scientists have signed for Imperial College, London was a severe blow to the older institution. </p> <p>Between them, the trio - professors Roy Anderson, Brian Spratt and Geoff Smith - are moving about 80 researchers from Oxford to London. With them also goes more than \u00a37m in research grants from the Wellcome Trust. </p> <p>Oxford was putting a brave face on the defections yesterday, saying the departure of the professors and their research teams were \"part of the normal movement of academic staff between leading research-intensive universities\". </p> <p>But there is no concealing the setback this represents to Oxford in its struggle to stay at the top of the research league with other science centres such as Imperial and Cambridge. The latest episode comes in the wake of the public relations disaster of the Laura Spence affair, when a talented comprehensive pupil ended up going to Harvard after Oxford rejected her. </p> <p>\"Eighty people will make a big dent in Oxford's reputation and research income,\" said one of those making the move. </p> <p><b> Convenient</b><br> </p> <p> The three professors and their teams have been poached by a new centre being set up by Imperial to study an area of vital interest to mankind - how diseases, from malaria to Aids, spread. </p> <p>The Wright-Fleming Institute is to be housed in an old medical school building at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, supremely convenient for scientists who like the idea of working in London but want to be able to retreat to the dreaming spires of Oxford at the end of the day. </p> <p>The head of the new institute - and the man collecting scientists from places such as Oxford - is Prof Jonathan Weber, who said the merger of west London's medical schools in 1997 had given Imperial the chance to create a world-class centre to study infection, immunology and epidemiology. </p> <p>\"Having a big research centre, with a critical mass of scientists and a clinical outlet, is quite an attractive proposition,\" he said. \"Poaching is, indeed, an ugly word. But it's not uncommon at universities. The point is that scientists of this calibre will only move if they think their research is going to be enhanced by doing so. </p> <p>\"The Imperial site does have a second advantage because of the railway. It does mean you can still live in Oxford and commute, so it's not such a major upheaval.\" </p> <p>It was already on the cards that Prof Anderson would leave Oxford in the wake of his \"neutral\" suspension from his post as director of the university's Wellcome Trust centre for the epidemiology of infected diseases. He was accused by a female colleague of implying that she gained her job through an alleged relationship with a senior scientist. He rejects the accusation. </p> <p>The scandal did nothing to diminish Prof Anderson's scientific reputation as a leader in the mathematical modelling of how viruses such as HIV and BSE spread. Now he takes that reputation with him to London - and another core member of the Oxford institute, Prof Spratt, an expert in the evolution of bacteria. </p> <p><b> Departure</b><br> </p> <p> A spokesman for the Wellcome Trust, which funds the Oxford institute to the tune of about \u00a314m a year, admitted yesterday that the departure of Prof Anderson and Prof Spratt would mean that the Trust, a huge contributor to medical research in Britain, would have to look again at what the institute does. </p> <p>The grants that the individual scientists get from the Wellcome Trust would travel with them, he said, from Oxford to London. \"If a scientist expresses a wish to move institution, we look at the request and agree if it's in their best interests. If they decide to move, they take their grants with them,\" he said. </p> <p>One of the scientists familiar with the background to Imperial's swoop said: \"I think what happened at Oxford made Roy's position there untenable, so it was inevitable, regardless of where the blame lies, that he would leave. It was a question of where it would be good to move to. Geoff Smith was recruited a year ago, prior to the Roy Anderson thing. Brian Spratt was originally recruited by Roy to Oxford and is moving on with him.\" </p> <p>Prof Smith is professor of virology at Oxford's pathology department. He will carry the same title at Imperial. </p> <p>In a short statement yesterday, Oxford pointed out that it had brought in a wave of fresh blood to renew its teaching and research, recruiting staff from Israel, Texas, Australia and Russia, plus two professors from Cambridge and one from Imperial. </p> <p>Prof Weber paid tribute to Oxford's science record, singling out the \"spectacular array of talent\" gathered in human genetics and immunology research there by Prof David Weatherall. </p> <p>So would he be poaching any of them? \"There are no plans at present,\" he said. \"But our new building is very large and we've got lots of space.\" </p> <p> <b>Science hotspots</b></p> <p>According to the 1996 research assessment exercise, Britain's top science universities are Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial College, London, and University College London </p> <p><b> Cambridge </b> is where William Harvey noted the circulation of blood, Isaac Newton worked on gravity and Francis Crick and James Watson deciphered DNA - is a powerhouse of cosmology and biology. Modern physics practically began there with the discovery of the electron, and it is big in electronics. Bill Gates put money into Cambridge's Silicon Fen </p> <p><b> Oxford</b> is star-studded. The ever-fashionable science of ethology - what creatures do, and why - practically began there, and the tradition is kept alive by writer- professor Richard Dawkins. It has the highest number of world-class research staff in a UK university and it pulled in more than \u00a3100m in government and industry research money two years running </p> <p><b> Imperial College</b> is a leader in sciences most people don't even think about, such as population biology and the tricky bits of robotics, in earthquake engineering and petroleum geology, as well as those they do think about, such as epidemics </p> <p><b> University College </b> is home to the pickled cadaver of the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham and it has been making itself useful for decades.

  "The Northern Ireland education minister, Martin McGuinness, pledged yesterday to tackle the problem of racial harassment in the province's schools. <p>He expressed concern over the findings of a University of Ulster report which showed that many ethnic minority groups experience racism in the workplace and schools as a way of life. </p> <p>The study, based on more than 100 interviews with Chinese, African, Indian and traveller communities, found that two thirds of schoolchildren in the province from a minority ethnic background had been taunted by other pupils about their race,and 14% had been assaulted. </p> <p>Mr McGuinness said: \"Racism and racist bullying is intolerable and has no place in our schools. </p> <p>\"My department will continue to work with members of minority ethnic communities to ... continue to improve our service.\" </p> <p>The report makes a number of recommendations to government departments, schools and the RUC on how to meet ethnic groups' needs. </p> <p>Among the problems the study highlighted was a failure of schools to respond adequately to racist incidents. </p> <p>One of the authors of the report, Paul Connolly, said the study showed racism was a greater problem in Northern Ireland than many people had previously acknowledged.</p>",
  "A scaling down of Notting Hill carnival should be considered by the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, because the event is growing beyond police control, the Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Ian Johnston warned yesterday. <p>The call came after two men were murdered in separate incidents at this year's carnival, which saw an estimated 1m revellers flow through the streets of west London over the bank holiday weekend.</p> <p>Mr Johnston said: \"After this year's events we would like to see some modification to the carnival. It has grown so much in recent years it is time for us to reflect where we are going with it.</p> <p>\"It is perhaps growing beyond police resources. Some 278 crimes were committed over the two days of the event, including the murders of Greg Watson and Abdul Bhatti.\"</p> <p>Mr Johnston emphasised he did not want to see an end to Europe's largest annual festival, but urged Mr Livingstone to make changes which could help prevent violence, such as introducing an earlier finishing time.</p> <p>\"The mayor should consider taking the decision about how long it lasts, who takes part and what area it covers,\" he said.</p> <p>Police have been criticised for not intervening enough in incidents at the carnival last weekend - one report suggested two police officers were told to walk away from a scene in which a man was wielding a knife. But Mr Johnston said: \"There is no question of this - on the contrary arrests are up by 84% this year and allegations of crime are up by 27%.</p> <p>\"Two officers on their way to another incident did come across a man with a knife. They were called away and a proper investigation was launched, and the man arrested.\"</p>",
  "<p>You can see the London Eye clearly from The Oval, and if you stare really hard you can see it inch around on its axis. On the pitch, however, the wheel is turning more perceptibly in England's favour.</p> <p>Today's Calypso collapse - five wickets for seven in 22 balls - was particularly special because it encompassed Brian Lara's first golden duck in Tests. Lara strode out, all superstar confidence, playing an immaculate defensive shot to the crowd. Thirty seconds later he had to turn on his heel, outwitted by a searing delivery from Craig White which removed his leg stump.</p> <p>White's revelatory season just gets better and better. He zipped in even more whippily today than he did at Headingley - and on a less responsive pitch - perhaps inspired by the presence of his mother, brother, sister, sister-in-law and nephew who all fly back to Melbourne tomorrow. He has now taken five wickets in an innings in successive Tests. When asked at the press conference why, or from where, he had suddenly found this zing, he replied, \"I feel very comfortable in the team situation. I know that my team-mates rate me and that they expect me to get wickets.\"</p> <p>Maybe this statement will provide some comfort to Nasser Hussain, whose batting is stuck in such a mire that he will need to find some seven-league boots from somewhere to jump out of it. His pair was the first by an England captain since Ian Botham in 1981. </p> <p>He had somehow survived four balls from Curtly Ambrose and ten from Courtney Walsh before finally being put out his misery by Nixon McLean's third ball of the day and, to be honest, it was a bit of a relief. In 2000 Hussain has scored 148 Test runs in 13 innings, at an average of 11. </p> <p>To make matters worse, by the time Graham Thorpe had dragged himself out to the middle, slow step by slow step, three lights were on the scoreboard and the umpires were offering the light. Two minutes later the heavens opened. Perhaps he needs to write this year off as the last of the nasty nineties and join David Gower in insisting that the new millennium doesn't begin until January 1 2001.</p> <p>After the first partnership of the match added 159, the next 19 only managed 247. England are now 212 ahead with eight wickets in hand. If this game follows its likely course, England's 31-year-wait to recapture the Wisden Trophy is nearly over.</p> <p><em>Tanya Aldred is assistant editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly</em></p>",
  "<p>Imtiaz Ahmed has been working as a senior house officer in British hospitals since July 1999. He is a foreign doctor, part of a group of people whose \"English language skills are not up to scratch and [whose] patients are suffering as a result\", according to statements last week from the shadow health minister Liam Fox. </p> <p>Yet, as he speaks from the ward of the department of medicine for elderly people at Whipps Cross hospital in London, Dr Ahmed is the most articulate of men. Like his colleagues from overseas, Dr Ahmed has had to pass rigorous tests to work as a senior house officer in a British hospital. And his English is better than many of those in the beds around him. </p> <p>Originally from Bangladesh, where he studied medicine in English, the young doctor dismissed Dr Fox's comments - the MP and former GP said: \"It is quite clear from talking to patients and doctors that the communications skills of many overseas-registered doctors are simply inadequate\" - as \"rubbish\". </p> <p>What concerns Dr Ahmed and many other overseas doctors is the impact such statements will have on doctors and students abroad who wish to come to Britain to experience working in the NHS. He said: \"Dr Fox's comments will demoralise overseas students if they see that a major party thinks that about them.\" </p> <p><strong> Stringent</strong><br> </p> <p>In its national plan for health, published last month, the government promised 7,000 more consultants and 2,000 more GPs before 2004. With a lack of trained British personnel, some of these places will have to be filled by foreign doctors. </p> <p>Britain has much more stringent English language tests than America and elsewhere. Overseas doctors wishing to practice in the UK must first pass the international English language testing system, where students have to pass sections in listening, reading, writing and speaking. Set by the British Council, doctors must achieve a higher pass rate than that needed in other sectors. </p> <p>After passing the tests, doctors must take the exceptionally difficult professional and linguistic assessment board (PLAB) test, set by the General Medical Council. A pass allows limited registration to practice medicine in the UK. </p> <p>At the end of a week in which their qualifications and language were the focus of debate, foreign doctors have said that Dr Fox's remarks would not encourage young doctors to work in a system already perceived to be racist by many of the 23,000 or so overseas doctors working within it. </p> <p>Surendra Kumar, chair of the Overseas Doctors Association, said: \"If these 23,000 doctors weren't here today there would be no NHS. Dr Fox has confused and misled the issue by putting all foreign doctors in one melting pot.\" </p> <p>Because of EU legislation providing for mutual recognition of qualifications, doctors who are citizens of member states are entitled to register in other member states. There are no controlling mechanisms or checks on their language skills. </p> <p>Dr Kumar said: \"I have known young Spanish, German, and other European doctors walking round wards with a dictionary trying to interpret what is wrong with a patient. If that is the sort of language difficulty that exists then I have no doubt what Dr Fox says, that it will put patients at risk. But I have no doubt his comments were targeted at south Asian doctors. </p> <p>\"For those doctors coming from outside the EU, they have been trained in English, using the same textbooks as their British counterparts. In spite of all this they have to go through very thorough tests before they can work here. Recently, the GMC conducted an audit of 55 British doctors, asking them to sit the PLAB test. Only two passed.\" </p> <p>Sam Everington, a GP based in Stepney, east London, who has studied racism within the NHS, said he has observed \"racial discrimination at every stage of a [foreign] doctor's career\". </p> <p>Aneez Esmail, who is based at Manchester University's department of general practice and has also investigated NHS racism, said: \"I speak better English than Liam Fox does. He is referring to a time in the early 1970s when the NHS was really short of doctors and imported them en masse. </p> <p>\"The country needed them and they came in; if they felt the language was a secondary issue and they wanted the knowledge then that's a choice that they made at the time.\" </p> <p>Sitting in his surgery in Bow, east London, Selladurai Shanmugadasan is disturbed by the aspersion cast on him and his colleagues. Dr Shan, as he is known to his patients, came to the UK from Sri Lanka in 1981. He worked in 10 British hospitals after passing his PLAB test, which he said was \"very stringent\". </p> <p><strong> Asset</strong><br> </p> <p>He feels the door is gradually being closed on non-European doctors.\"A lot of people who talk against foreign doctors were delivered by them and looked after by them as a child. Foreign doctors are highly intelligent people coming here and they are an asset to this country. A lot of the postgraduate exams they pass in their country are more difficult to pass than exams here. </p> <p>\"It's cheaper to have a foreign doctor working in this country than to train a British doctor. There's a big manpower crisis in this country and the NHS will be in trouble if people like Liam Fox continue to lash out against foreign doctors.\" </p> <p>What bothers Dr Shan is the idea that the ability to speak good English makes a person a good doctor. \"You cannot automatically say that every person born in this country and trained here and qualified actually listens and understands their patients. The doctor/patient relationship is very complicated, you need to have character and feel to help people. Just because you know English doesn't make you a good doctor.\" </p> <p><strong>Language check-up</strong></p> <p><strong> A sample question from the academic writing sections says:</strong> <br>Present a written argument or case to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic. </p> <p>The first car appeared on British roads in 1888.

  "<p>There is only one question on the mind of the inquisitive this week: what is contained in those missing 200 words? What joys, gems and secrets did David and Victoria Beckham resort to the law to have removed from Andrew Morton's unauthorised biography? </p> <p>The couple went to court seeking an injunction to stop publication of about half of the 60,000 words of Morton's imaginatively titled \"Posh and Becks\". But after advice from their QC Michael Tugendhat - whose fees make Roy Keane's remuneration look like loose change - the pair settled for only 200 being edited out of the final version. Two hundred words that immediately became real currency. </p> <p>\"We are not allowed to discuss what has been taken out,\" says Michael O'Mara, the publisher of the tome that has so offended England's finest footballer and his wife. \"The only thing I can say is what has been removed I don't give a damn about.\" </p> <p>Which leaves the rest of us speculating. Was it the bit about David giving Victoria singing lessons? Was it the suggestion that Victoria finds all that training business her husband goes in for an unnecessary distraction from the serious world of shopping and film premieres? Or was it the revelation that Brooklyn had signed pre-school forms with Manchester City? </p> <p>In the meantime, in court there was much talk of moral high ground; the Beckhams wanting to protect their privacy, Morton citing lofty principles of freedom of speech. Actually, this is not a debate about ethics. It is significantly more straightforward. </p> <p>Morton is no whistle-blowing champion standing on the barricades to defend the inalienable right of all of us to say what we wish in print. He wants to make money from tittle-tattle about a saleable couple. And if the Beckhams were so anxious that their life remain totally private, it is unfortunate that in the very week of the case, David had invited OK! into his home for an 18-page photo shoot. He is, in case you missed it, a dab hand with the pasta. </p> <p>No, what the case was about was control. Control of image, control of distribution and, most importantly, control of income. Since the football boom, as players have gradually realised there is a fortune in their face as well as their feet (though probably not in David Hopkin's case), a paranoia has developed within the game that vast sums of money are being made by outsiders which should rightly belong in the participants' pockets. </p> <p>As journalists engaged in trying to report on the business are increasingly discovering, faxed requests for media interviews these days often come back with the scribbled message: \"What's the fee?\" And when the putative interviewee is informed that some newspapers don't pay, the standard football-speak response has become: you're hoping to sell papers off me, why shouldn't I get a slice of the action? </p> <p>If the argument seems ferociously mercenary, it is understandable how it arises. This week, after Luis Figo relinquished all his commercial rights to his new employers, the president of Real Madrid, Florentino Perez, claimed that his club would be able to recoup all \u00a337m of the transfer fee for the player by exploiting his image. </p> <p>\"Figo is the first player to cede his image rights to the club,\" Senor Perez said on announcing the Real deal. \"Selling those rights worldwide will be worth a lot of money. I hope Figo will turn out to be free by the end of the six years of his contract.\" </p> <p>Such optimism suggests that either Senor Perez has tapped into a huge reservoir of money in sales of posters, lunchboxes and computer mousemats bearing the face of a popular footballer, or that he is hopelessly naive. But if Perez is right, then David Beckham and his busy wife would be crazy not to make every effort - even going to law - to retain control over the trade in their celebrity. It is not greed, it is common sense. Particularly when it was revealed in court that Beckham's own authorised book - My World - is to be published in the very same week as Morton's effort. </p> <p>All this, however, casts an entertaining spin on Michael O'Mara's other post-court case comment about those excised 200 words. </p> <p>\"The Beckhams,\" he says, \"objected to material describing the way they attempt to control their media image, rather than intimate personal details.\" </p> <p>If O'Mara is right about the disputed content, then evidently the Beckhams were prepared to go far as the High Court to prevent the revelation that they like to exercise control over their media image. It is an irony presumably lost on the couple and their pricy advisers. But it is one the rest of us can enjoy hugely.</p>",
  "When he walked through the door of 10 Downing Street for the first time, Tony Blair must have known the ability to handle criticism was necessary to his new job. <p>But while he was no doubt prepared for censure from the opposition benches, he probably did not expect a regular slating from a good deal closer to home, his father-in-law. </p> <p>In the latest episode of the prime ministerial family washing their its dirty laundry in public, Mr Blair was again yesterday forced to slap down criticism of his government from Tony Booth. Like rather a lot of British pensioners, Mr Boothis none too happy with the government's refusal to restore the link between earnings and the state pension. </p> <p>He doesn't, however, blame his son-in-law directly for the last government-approved increase, which saw a single person's payment rise by just 75p rise in a single person's pension. </p> <p>Mr Booth blames chancellor Gordon Brown and wants Mr Blair to loosen the iron chancellor's purse strings. </p> <p>\"The prime minister is the first secretary of the Treasury,\" said Mr Booth. (Mr Blair is first lord).\"He has the authority to intervene and correct the mistakes and miscalculations of this chancellor and he should do so.\" </p> <p>So incensed is Mr Booth at what he sees as the government's miserliness, that he is lending his support to the National Pensioners' Convention, a group which campaigns for the restoration of the earnings link so poorer pensioners do not have to rely on means-tested benefit. </p> <p>In pursuit of the campaign, Mr Booth yesterday appeared on Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>He said: \"The government can afford it because we know that the national insurance fund has a surplus of over \u00a35bn and by 2002 this will be doubled to almost \u00a310.5bn.\" </p> <p>The prime minister, in Scotland chairing a meeting of the joint ministerial committee before spending a weekend with the royal family at Balmoral, was philosophical. Mr Blair said on Radio Scotland: \"I don't think it will be the first time I had a little bit of grief from Tony along the way. </p> <p>\"If we were to re-link pensions to earnings, broken by the last government, the cost for future generations would be enormous. </p> <p>\"We have to look for more sophisticated and better targeted ways of helping [pensioners].\" </p> <p>If Mr Blair was not exactly receiving succour from his family yesterday, it did not stop him from offering also offered support to Scotland's beleaguered education minister, Sam Galbraith, who is under increasing pressure to resign over the exam results chaos. Mr Blair does not want him to go. </p> <p>\"In my view it would be very wrong if that happened,\" he said.</p>",
  "At least 22 known or suspected football hooligans have been prevented from attending the France v England match in Paris tonight under tough new legislation designed to stop troublemakers travelling abroad. <p>The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), which monitors football hooliganism, said last night that the number prevented from attending the match is likely to increase as police forces around the country step up security at rail and ferry terminals to prevent troublemakers leaving the country. </p> <p>The Football Disorder Act, which came into effect on Monday, gives police the right to prevent even those who have not committed any offence from leaving the country or attending a match if it is felt they may cause trouble at some point. Hooligans can be banned for up to 10 years with orders applying to domestic and international matches. </p> <p>Three banning orders were served earlier this week while another 19 supporters have been served with summonses ordering them to appear before a magistrate for a banning order hearing. They will not be allowed to leave the country until after their appearance. </p> <p>Last Wednesday, Chris Sawford, 21, from Swindon, became the first person to be affected by the new legislation when he was served with a two-year banning order preventing him attending matches at home or abroad. </p> <p>Yesterday Steven Turnball, 28, from Littlehampton, West Sussex, and his twin brother, Christopher, were also served with two-year orders. </p> <p>Under previous legislation only those who had committed a football-related offence could be served with banning orders. </p> <p>Police have the right to detain suspects for six hours before serving them with a notice to appear before a magistrate for a banning order hearing. </p> <p>An NCIS spokeswoman said: \"We expect the number of people prevented from attending the Paris match to increase. The new legislation is exactly what we wanted. For the first time it gives us the power to turn back troublemakers from our own border.\" </p> <p>A security operation was launched at Manchester airport with police on the lookout for known or suspected hooligans. Insp Graham Lennie, of Greater Manchester police, said: \"We are looking for people who are known to us, or who we can check for a history of violence, or who we believe will be at the match to cause trouble.\" </p> <p>England fans have been given an allocation of 6,500 tickets for the match. Police do not expect any serious disorder at the friendly.</p>",
  "<p>In football the tills are alive to the sound of a new music. The air is filled with rejoicing as the leading players - and their agents - consider the lucrative consequences of the imminent abolition of transfer fees. </p> <p>The acceptance by Fifa that the buying and selling of human beings who can kick a ball better than most is contrary to the free movement of labour as laid down in the Treaty of Rome looks set to trigger off a gold rush compared to which the free-for-all which followed the Bosman ruling will seem like diving for pennies. </p> <p>When Sepp Blatter, the president of Fifa, answered the European Commission's challenge to the principle of transfers by admitting that the system had to end he surely wound up a saga which has lasted the best part of 40 years. It began with George Eastham challenging the right of Newcastle United to keep him when he wanted to join Arsenal and eventually winning his case in the High Court, which ruled the old retain-and-transfer system illegal in law. </p> <p>Yet freedom of contract was not accepted by the ante-diluvian Football League until 1978 and even when, five years ago, the European Court of Justice upheld the Bosman decision, which barred transfer fees for players out of contract, clubs continued to pay spiralling amounts to strengthen their squads. </p> <p>The removal of the limit on the number of foreign players teams could field accelerated the process, culminating this summer in the \u00a335m Lazio paid for an Argentine, Hernan Crespo, and the \u00a337m that took Portugal's Luis Figo to Real Madrid. </p> <p>Unchecked, it is clear that the game's plutocrats would quickly take the transfer record towards the \u00a3100m mark, with the clubs who are less well off benefiting from the inflationary feed-down. Now it would seem that this Gadarene rush to pursue a few outstanding footballers with ever-increasing amounts is about to stop. </p> <p>The money will still flow but instead of flowing from club to club, with the financially anaemic relying on selling a player or two in order to stay alive, it will flood out of the game and into the pockets of those relatively few footballers whose talents are in the biggest demand. </p> <p>Ever since the maximum wage was abolished in 1961 (a year which, incidentally, saw the first \u00a3100,000 transfer in Britain when Manchester City sold Denis Law to Torino) the game in England has been increasingly dominated as much by wealth as ability. </p> <p>The prime motivation for the setting up of the Premier League was that fewer clubs would share a financial cake made considerably sweeter by BSkyB money. Next week some of the less well-endowed Premiership clubs will challenge the division of the latest TV windfall, a move bound to renew speculation about a breakaway into a European league by the wealthy few. </p> <p>The prospect of ending the transfer system will further alarm the Premier League's lower-middle classes as much as it is already causing consternation in the Nationwide League. The idea that players' wages could be paid out of the gate receipts is as old hat as brown bowlers. </p> <p>Any sadness Coventry City felt at losing Robbie Keane was softened by the \u00a313m that Internazionale paid for him. Ipswich Town's successful promotion campaign last season was given added impetus by the \u00a36.5m they received from Newcastle United for Kieron Dyer. </p> <p>The notion that a satisfactory system of compensation can be devised for clubs losing players who, like Keane and Dyer, are between the ages of 18 and 24 is fanciful. Even if the EC agrees to Fifa's suggested compromise of abolishing transfers for players over 24, the game will still be stuck with the effects of inflated fees and wages. Most transfer fees are paid by instalments anyway. </p> <p>For the players, doing away with fees will be a mixed blessing. Sure, they will have the basic right to change jobs and work for employers who pay the best wages. But, by the same token, employers will be able to dispense with their services more easily and, in a trade which at present accepts that injured workers can receive full pay for the time it takes them to recover, this could be a worry. </p> <p>For certain players the transfer system has been an extra safeguard against peremptory dismissal. Footballers frequently in bother on or off the field might find they really do become more trouble than they are worth. </p> <p>Unless the EC accepts Fifa's suggestion that players would be allowed to change clubs only once a year, and then only during a specified period, the anarchy always predicted when footballers get more freedom may become a reality. </p> <p>As it is, with contracts lasting no more than a year and players over 24 having the right to end them at any time, the role of the manager might be reduced to pinning up team-sheets and talking to reporters. Managers, in fact, could be the new serfs in football - albeit serfs in Mercs.</p>",
  "<p>When the ferocity of the West Indies pace attack was at its greatest, Andy Roberts, about as mean and snarling as a fast bowler could get, was asked whether he ever thought to employ a slower ball. His quicker one, he suggested, was the bouncer that struck the batsman on the helmet because he played too late. His slower one was the bouncer that struck him on the helmet because he played too early. </p> <p>Roberts was so fearsome that the main role of Richard Lewis, a Hampshire middle-order batsman, was to stand at short leg and help disoriented batsmen to their feet. For the likes of Roberts, Holding or Patterson to identify the need for a slower ball when the unremitting West Indies pace onslaught of the 70s and 80s was proving so destructive was simply unimaginable. </p> <p>Graham Thorpe would be forgiven for wishing for a return to such straightforward times, when men were men and fast bowlers were the most manly of all. To fall to Courtney Walsh's slower ball once this summer was unnerving enough; to do so for a second time yesterday must make him question his faculties. </p> <p>Walsh was once described by John Bracewell, briefly his coach at Gloucestershire, as more at peace with himself than any cricketer he had ever known. Tranquillity is the essence of his slower ball. It is so chilled out that occasionally it has been rumoured to utter the phrase \"stay cool, man\" as it drifts towards the batsman complete with dark glasses and Bob Marley songbook. </p> <p>The Walsh dope ball has certainly made a dope out of Thorpe. His Test comeback at Old Trafford this summer lasted precisely one delivery as he lost the trajectory of a looping yorker that, at 64.7mph, was around 15-20mph short of Walsh's normal speed, turned away in alarm and was lbw. \"It came out of nowhere,\" said Thorpe. </p> <p>The speed gun measured Dope Ball II at 67mph, slightly faster, but to all intents and purposes the same delivery. This time Thorpe willed himself not to turn away, the warning \"slower ball\" messaged around his brain but the inswing struck his ankle as it defeated a fretful, groping push. </p> <p>When it happened yesterday, he had been batting for one-and-a-half hours and, although he was never in touch, might have assumed he was seeing the ball pretty well. </p> <p>Deceived batsmen often console themselves that the ball has passed over the top of the sightscreen, and since Chris Read was bowled for nought by Chris Cairns' slower ball at Lord's last summer, and his batting capabilities were outrageously ridiculed as a result, an additional white tarpaulin has been stretched across the boards at the Nursery End. </p> <p>But English Test grounds could erect sightscreens as tall as the Ostankino television tower and Courtney's slower ball would still befuddle. The action remains as smooth and rhythmical as ever, the trap is silently sprung and the object is instant paralysis. </p> <p>The finest West Indian exponent of the slower ball was arguably Franklyn Stephenson, who estimated in his Nottinghamshire \"double\" year of 1,000 first-class runs and 100 wickets that he had taken about one third of his wickets with slower ones. Brian Hardie was turned full circle by one that bowled him in a Benson and Hedges Cup final. </p> <p>Not every bowler approaching the end of his career has been happy to win praise for his subtlety. Ted Dexter, the former England captain, whose brisk medium brought 66 Test wickets, described the day he realised that his zip had gone. \"I took two catches off my own bowling against Glamorgan and was complimented on my cleverly disguised slower ball,\" he bemoaned. </p> <p>More than one method is employed by the best practitioners. Some use the tips of the fingers, some prefer the palm ball, delivered from deep in the hand. Darren Gough, who has turned more balls this summer than Robert Croft, is now developing one that goes the other way. England, since Duncan Fletcher's arrival as coach, have been encouraged to add the weapon to their armoury. </p> <p>The days of \"running in faster and grunting\" have long gone, and one-day cricket, often pilloried for wrecking techniques, can take some of the credit. Steve Waugh made wonderful use of the slow 'un in the 1987 World Cup, and Ian Harvey's perpetual changes of pace have made a massive contribution to Gloucestershire's run of four successive one-day trophies. </p> <p>The master, though, is Courtney. Every ball is a little slower these days but the slowest ones of all have been one of the delights of the summer. Sleight of hand; great of stature.</p>"
