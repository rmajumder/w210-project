  "<p>England produced what was arguably their finest victory in one-day cricket here last night when, chasing 305 to win the first of their three limited-overs matches against Pakistan, they reached their target with five wickets and 16 deliveries to spare. </p> <p>This was the fourth highest successful chase in international one-day history; only India, Australia (both 316) and Sri Lanka (313) have done better than this. England's previous best was the 286 for four they scored against New Zealand at Old Trafford in 1986. </p> <p>In the most exciting chase since Steve McQueen took to the streets of San Francisco in Bullet, England overcame not only one of the world's leading one-day sides but also some familiar umpiring problems and the early loss of both openers. </p> <p>A partnership of 114 in 18 overs between the captain Nasser Hussain (73) and Graeme Hick (56) made it all possible. But, even when Hussain was fourth out at 164 in the 31st over, England's hopes looked far-fetched. </p> <p>Andrew Flintoff, with 84 from 60 balls, and Graham Thorpe, with an unbeaten 64 off 66, then added 138 for the fifth wicket in 16 overs. </p> <p>Flintoff hit six muscular fours and three sixes. In successive overs he pulled Abdur Razzak and Wasim Akram over the ropes and then - a remarkable shot - he check-drove Waqar Younis for another six before falling just before the end. </p> <p>\"It's something I've wanted to do and been threatening to do for a while - win a match for England,\" Flintoff said, \"and that's why I was so annoyed about getting out.\" </p> <p>But, just when England thought it was safe to go back into the hot water of another Pakistan tour, they discovered it can still leave scald marks. </p> <p>They were four balls into their first meaningful innings in this country for 13 years when something happened that stirred uncomfortable memories of the umpiring of Shakeel Khan and Shakoor Rana, whose dark deeds did so much to dissuade them from returning. </p> <p>Wasim appealed for a catch behind against Alec Stewart. Stewart, who did not appear to touch the ball, stood his ground. The umpire, Riazuddin, did not move either. But then, under intense pressure from the fielding side, the official gave Stewart out, some five seconds after the original appeal. </p> <p>Stewart showed dissent. First he dropped his bat in an abject attitude of disbelief. Then he started a slow, head-shaking return to the dressing room. </p> <p>England's attitude has been commendably positive but just over a week into their tour all those fears, of dazzling batting, fizzing fast bowling and iffy umpiring, not to mention the heat and turbulent tummies, had proved justified. But England's response to this setback was emphatic and heroic. </p> <p>The Pakistan innings was a beast of a thing. It attacked the England bowlers with a chilling voracity at the start and then slumbered in a post-prandial, lip-smacking sort of way before slaying once more in the final overs, the last 10 of which yielded 106 runs. </p> <p>Its pattern was set by the openers Saeed Anwar and Imran Nazir who plundered 21 runs from the first 12 deliveries. The fifty had come up in the eighth over and by the end of the important 15-over stage 92 had been scored. </p> <p>Imran Nazir was third out, at 97, but Inzaman-ul-Haq then added 100 in 26 overs with Yousuf Youhana. By the time Inzamam was fifth out for an 87-ball 71 the remarkable Razzak was into his electric stride. He hit Craig White, Mark Ealham and Darren Gough for audacious sixes and there were also five fours in his 40-ball 75. </p> <p>Gough and White together cost 141. They looked shell-shocked. It seemed unlikely that before the day was through they would be sharing a jig of pure joy. </p> <p>Hussain said afterwards: \"This was my most satisfying one-day win. We did something very special today. Andy Flintoff played as well as he can and showed how fit he was.\"</p>",
  "<p>Halifax has written to more than 200,000 current account customers informing them they risk being penalised with a halt on interest payments, higher charges, and a longer wait for cheques to be cleared. </p> <p>The bank, which admits its letter was misguided, has just embarked on a highly publicised campaign to shake up the staid current account market. </p> <p>While the bulk of Halifax customers are being offered lower charges and a ground-breaking 4% interest rate on accounts in credit, letters sent to about 10% of its 2m current account holders make no reference to the new rates and simply warn that their service is being changed and that costs will rise. </p> <p>\"The period you have to wait before you can withdraw money against a cheque paid into your account will increase by one bank working day,\" the letter informs customers. </p> <p>The charge for processing cheques, standing orders or direct debits which cannot be paid because of insufficient funds is to be raised from \u00a325 to \u00a328 from December. In addition, to withdraw cash amounts of less than \u00a3300, customers will only be able to use cash machines. However, they will not be charged. </p> <p>The recipients of the letter are also told that the name of their account is being changed to Cardcash from January 9 next year, at which point interest payments, currently 0.25%, will be stopped. </p> <p>The letter has been sent to those Halifax customers who possess what the bank terms \"limited facilities,\" such as no overdraft facilities. </p> <p>The bank is also in the process of writing to 2m existing customers of Cardcash, the basic bank account it helped to pioneer for customers who might be turned away from other banks. The treasury has demanded that other banks make such accounts available by the end of this month. </p> <p>The letters sent to Cardcash customers contain details of improved terms. For instance, \"disloyalty charges\" will be scrapped, which might save such customers \u00a312 a year. The Cardcash customers are also informed about the new 4% interest rate current account. </p> <p>A Halifax spokesman last night admitted that the bank had made a mistake in the letters to \"limited facilities\" customers and pledged to write to them again. </p> <p>\"We're sorry. We've made a mistake and we're going to put it right,\" the spokesman said. He denied that the move amounted to a surcharge on one class of customer designed to subsidise its aggressive move to win custom from high street rivals, which the Halifax has said will cost it \u00a350m. </p> <p>Halifax said it would review the details of the customers who received the letters to check their eligibility for the 4% interest rate current account, which it intends to launch next year. To be eligible, the customers must pay \u00a31,000 a month into the account. </p> <p>Halifax is leading a charge on the current account market, which is dominated by the \"big four\" - NatWest, Barclays, Lloyds TSB and HSBC. Between them they control about 80% of the current account industry and generally offer low interest rate payments, as little as 0.25%, to accounts in credit. </p> <p>At the same time, Halifax has been alone amongst the major banks in offering facilities to those with poor credit histories or limited incomes -an area where its rivals are still resisting government pressure to improve their service.</p>",
  "<p>Lembit Opik had a good day at the office yesterday. Perhaps it was the sensual contours of his hand-made leather in-tray that did it, or the way the luxurious (and luxuriously priced) carpet caressed his shoes; or the way the light in the atrium glinted off the water in the fountain. Either way, the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire - usually perceived as a man of rather more apocalyptic temperament, given his role as a key voice in the campaign to warn the world of the catastrophic consequences of being hit by a meteorite - certainly enjoyed his first day at work in what is, yard for yard, Britain's most expensive, and arguably most contentious office building, Portcullis House. \"Despite all the controversy, it feels good and I think it will feel good for our visitors,\" he says of the new Westminster home for 210 MPs. \"And it did feel great walking into the building.\" </p> <p>Once upon a time, the opulent office could be justified - if it needed to be justified at all - on the old-fashioned principles of conspicuous consumption: who could doubt the power and credibility of a government - or a bank, or a management consultancy - that could afford to transform countless tonnes of marble and gleaming steel into a vast, mortality-defying, space-wasting monument to corporate might? But in an age of efficiency, the more likely rationalisation speaks of the need to attract the best talent; to provide them with airy cathedrals in which to worship the god of productivity. Which rather prompts the question: do they work? </p> <p>Luxury has always been a critical part of the subtle lines of power that crisscross every office floor: used aggressively, the ostentatious demonstration of opulence can be wonderfully flattering - or absolutely terrifying. \"The chief executive's office was amazing: awesome mahogany, indescribably deep carpets,\" recalls a former employee of a major London bank. \"If you were summoned, you knew it was because you were pretty special - or because you were in for a serious dressing-down.\" But whether the marble and the gurgling fountains actually make a serious difference to workplace morale and productivity - whether, in other words, Lembit Opik and his fellow MPs would be one iota less effective in their work if a few thousand pounds less had been spent on the office carpet - seems rather more questionable. </p> <p>Those who have worked in similarly plush environments testify to the little jolt of happiness - of being wanted - that hit them every time they showed up for work. \"Every day I worked in that building I walked through the doors and thought: this feels good ,\" says one City worker. \"You walked off the street and immediately you felt special,\" another recalls. </p> <p>Yet complacency settles in pretty fast, even in palaces such as the notorious European Bank of Reconstruction and Development near London's Liverpool Street, where a \u00a366m marble-heavy refurbishment earned it the epithet \"the Glistening Bank\" and was a key factor in the resignation of its president, Jacques Attali. At one point, more had been spent on revamping the office than on the projects the bank had been established to support. \"There was a lot of marble - it was real Bonfire of the Vanities stuff,\" one former employee recalls. \"But, hey - you got used to it.\" </p> <p>Organisational psychologists don't buy the luxury-productivity link either (although that might just be jealousy). \"There are hygiene factors and motivating factors,\" says Dr Rob Yeung, a business psychologist at the consultancy Kiddy and Partners. \"Hygiene factors are things like having a sufficiently warm office, access to food, drink, shelter - the physiological needs. Once these are satisfied, they no longer actually motivate any further or produce greater performance or quality of thought or things like that. Pay, even, is quite often described as a hygiene factor: once people are paid enough to live OK and go on a few holidays, it doesn't actually motivate people to work any harder.\" </p> <p>Forget deep-pile carpets and deeper leather armchairs: quality relationships and control over one's working environment - however grotty - matter more. \"The kind of things that make people work harder are feeling valued, feeling like their efforts are recognised, having a good working relationship with colleagues, customers and suppliers, and feeling their needs for achievement are being met in the workplace.\" </p> <p> Luxurious surroundings \"can make people feel good about themselves, but can have a rebound effect,\" says Dr Valerie Lamont, a chartered counselling psychologist. \"In some people, it creates a sense of 'What am I doing here? This doesn't feel like a comfortable place to work', particularly if there is any discrepancy between the image of the office and the actual working practices.\" </p> <p>Then there is the famous \"lobby factor\" - the predictable tendency for spacious grandeur to be rapidly replaced by low-ceilinged, fluorescent-lit squalor the moment employees pass from the public areas to the private offices. \"The lobby was full of marble and chrome and big fountains with goldfish and lovely plants,\" is a typical observation. \"The communal areas were lovely, but the actual offices were horrid. I had to leave because there was a real culture of terror, backstabbing and bullying that was so awful, the lobby frankly wasn't going to keep me.\" </p> <p>There is, in any case, something almost embarrassingly old-fashioned about Portcullis House's approach to luxury - the armchairs with snooze buttons, the notorious fig trees. The new economy it ain't: ask any of the burgeoning ranks of edgy, up-to-the-minute office designers to work you up a symphony in marble and cascading fountains, and they would drop their laptops in horror. </p> <p>\"Ten years ago, maybe,\" says Arnold Levin, director of the Center for Workplace Innovation, a Washington DC-based office design firm. \"Then, the law firms we designed for would always be opulent; always stone, wood, marble. But even our law firm clients, though they spend a bit more than our dot.com startups, are very concerned that their clients don't get the impression their fees are being poured into the workplace. Across the board, there's so much more money being spent on technology and wiring and cabling that opulence is the last thing on anybody's mind.\" </p> <p>Back at Portcullis House, in his deluxe third-floor office, however, Lembit Opik is understandably keen to emphasise the productivity benefits of all that spending. \"There has been a dramatic improvement in the work environment - it's acoustically well-designed, natural light is used well - it feels good, and that's got to be good for productivity ... It makes very good sense for the long term.\" And perhaps there are other advantages: if a meteorite does ever hurtle from the heavens and land on London, maybe the carpet at Portcullis House will break its fall.</p>",
  "<p>The government is likely to come under renewed pressure to put a stop to the wholesale - and unchecked - employment of locums after the General Medical Council yesterday struck off an anaesthetist whose blunders led to the death of a 10 year-old boy. </p> <p>John Evans-Appiah worked for more than 20 years as an NHS locum doctor before finally getting full registration just a year before the boy, Darren Denholm, died after dentistry treatment. Three weeks later, a woman was put through a nightmare of pain when Evans-Appiah inadequately anaesthetised her for a caesarean section. </p> <p>Despite a devastating report by the audit commission 18 months ago, which said that patient safety was being put at risk by the failure of hospital trusts and health authorities to check employed locums, nothing has yet been done. </p> <p>The audit commission found that although just over 70% of trusts saw references from past employers, only 38% checked them, and fewer than 10% saw certificates establishing the doctors' qualifications. </p> <p>Evans-Appiah was described by the fatal accident inquiry held in Edinburgh, following Darren's death, as one of \"a tribe of wandering locums\". The audit commission report said there could be 3,500 locums working in the NHS on any day. A third of the trusts had reported adverse events of some kind, from very minor to serious, associated with locums in the past year. </p> <p>Evans-Appiah was one of the 70% who qualified overseas - a group considered insufficiently trained to have full status and a permanent job and yet who were employed often without question. The NHS relies upon them to fill its staff shortfalls. </p> <p>The GMC's professional conduct committee found 17 charges proved against Evans-Appiah. Yesterday it said it amounted to professional misconduct and ordered his name be erased from the register. </p> <p>Mary Clark-Glass, chairing the committee, said EvansAppiah had been guilty of \"critical failings\" and failed to meet \"basic standards\" of patient care. The Ghanaian-born doctor, who trained in Ukraine, was also found guilty of dishonestly trying to cover his tracks by creating false medical records relating to Darren's death and trying to get staff at the Peffermill dental clinic to agree to them. </p> <p>The British Medical Association said it had supported the audit commission's call for reform of the locum system. Ian Bogle, BMA chairman, said: \"We said action was needed to provide effective supervision and careers guidance for such doctors early in their careers, otherwise they tend to become permanent locums without access to proper training and study leave. When doctors are moving from post to post, often for short periods of employment, quality checks on their competence are vital.\" </p> <p>Last November, the government published a consultation document on dealing with poorly performing doctors, which recognised that locums represented \"a particular problem because there is seldom an on-going relationship with a single employer\". It suggested \"smart cards\" for locums to prove they had no black marks against them. Last night a Department of Health spokesman said the system needed \"someone to own and be responsible for locums\". </p> <p>Delivering the GMC's decision on Evans-Appiah, Mrs Glass told him: \"You failed to ensure an adequate level of anaesthesia before instructing the dentist to go ahead. When Darren moved you compounded this by failing to administer more anaesthetic. Instead you instructed the dentist to administer a local anaesthetic which [had] adrenaline and which you should have known was contraindicated.\" She said he had failed to adequately monitor Darren's physiological state and to follow even \"the basic life support procedure\". </p> <p>Three weeks later Evans-Appiah had failed to ensure an adequate level of anaesthesia during a caesarean operation on 33-year-old Hazel Woolger. In July 1993, while he was a locum registrar at the Falkirk and district hospital, he had also put a patient's life in danger by mistakenly giving a paralysis-inducing drug for a caesarean, which stopped the woman breathing. He was then put on limited registration on condition that his performance be monitored.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Close-of-play bulletin</strong></p> <p>England pulled off an outstanding five-wicket win over Pakistan in Karachi to go 1-0 up in the best-of-three one-day series. They reached their target of 305 with 16 balls to spare - only three sides have scored more to win a one-day international. Four batsmen passed fifty, but the best innings was played by Andy Flintoff, whose 84 from 60 balls contained the sort of clean hitting he had previously reserved for the county game. He shared a matchwinning fifth-wicket stand of 105 with Graham Thorpe, who finished unbeaten on 64.</p> <p>England began the final 15 overs still needing 106 to win and with the game in the balance. But Thorpe used his feet to drive Abdur Razzaq through the covers on the up, and when Flintoff pulled Razzaq for six in the next over, it began to look as if England could do it.</p> <p>Flintoff pulled a waist-high no-ball from Wasim Akram into the stands at midwicket in the next over and soon after moved to a 39-ball half-century. It was awesome stuff, and a crowd that had heaved with delight during Abdur Razzaq's dazzling 75 not out from 40 balls was reduced to a quiet hum.</p> <p>Thorpe got to 50 himself, from 51 deliveries, and the 100 stand came up in the 42nd over. Flintoff promptly lifted Waqar Younis over long-off for his third six. Maybe England will think twice before sending him home after the one-day series.</p> <p>It looked as if Flintoff would be there at the end, but with three runs needed he edged Razzaq to Moin Khan and left cursing angrily. He needn't have been so harsh on himself: he had just played one of England's great one-day knocks.</p> <p><strong>35-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>England and Pakistan were on course for a tight finish in the first one-day international at Karachi. Set 305 to win, England had reached 199 for 4 after 35 overs, and needed a further 106 to win off 15 overs. A lot depended on Graham Thorpe (35) and Andy Flintoff (13).</p> <p>England were happy to let thnigs tick over at around four an over during the middle of the innings, as Thorpe played himself in busily and Nasser Hussain, coated in sweat, coasted for a while. But the feeling was that the batsmen were taking their foot off the gas just a little bit too much. </p> <p>The pressure finally got to Hussain, who had already got away with a couple of mishits into empty spaces. He lunged forward at Mushtaq Ahmed and was beaten by a ball that didn't turn much. Video replays confirmed Moin Khan's stumping had been successful, and Hussain departed for 73 to make it 164 for 4.</p> <p>Thorpe responded immediately by leaning back and cutting a Mushtaq Ahmed legbreak through point, while Flintoff opened his boundary count with a fierce cut as Waqar Younis dropped short. Thorpe cut Waqar for four in his next over, and England were just about keeping on top of the seven or so runs required an over.</p> <p><strong>25-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>England were making a brave attempt to overhaul Pakistan's total of 304 for 9 in the first one-dayer at Karachi, and after 25 overs had reached 143 for 3. They required another 162 at 6.48 an over. Only three sides have ever chased more to win in an ODI, but, for a while, Nasser Hussain and Graeme Hick played with little regard for history.</p> <p>The 100 came up in the 16th over, and Hussain moved to 50 in the 17th, when he also brought up an excellent century stand off just 96 balls. He was even working the gaps well for the ones and twos - something he hasn't always managed to do in previous one-day knocks.</p> <p>Hick got his half-century with a thumping straight-drive for four off Mushtaq Ahmed via umpire Riazuddin's shin, and after 20 overs England were 118 for 2, compared with Pakistan's 100 for 3 at that stage. England needed Hick to go on and do a Razzaq. Instead Razzaq did for Hick, having him caught behind off a lazy waft with the second ball of a new spell for a 51-ball 56. It left England 127 for 3 in the 21st over - and reliant on Hussain. </p> <p>Andy Flintoff was still to come, of course, but England faced a huge task.</p> <p><strong>15-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>After the controversial dismissal of Alec Stewart, England were in even further trouble when Marcus Trescothick top-edged a pull off Waqar Younis to Mushtaq Ahmed at midwicket for 11 to make it 13 for 2. But Nasser Hussain and Graeme Hick went about batting them back into the match, and after 15 overs England had progressed to 89 for 2. At the same stage Pakistan were 95 for 2. But that was well before Abdur Razzaq got going.</p> <p>Hussain drove Waqar to third man for four and Hick slashed Wasim Akram for another boundary over the slips. Then they began to play some more authentic strokes. Hussain flicked Waqar to the midwicket boundary and straight-drove him for four in the same over. </p> <p>The 50 came up in the 10th over, with Hick in particular working the gaps well, and when Abdur Razzaq, the hero of Pakistan's innings, was introduced into the attack in the 11th over, Hussain really took charge. He drove his first ball through the covers for four, then edged him to third man and forced him through the covers off the back foot for two more fours in the same over.</p> <p>Hick joined in by lifting Saqlain Mushtaq straight for six and hitting Razzaq back over his head for four. It was the sort of approach England had to maintain throughout the innings if they were to get close to Pakistan's 304.</p> <p><strong>England's innings</strong></p> <p>England's pursuit of 305 began disastrously as Alec Stewart fell first ball to the third legitimate delivery of the innings. He was given out caught behind off Wasim Akram in controversial circumstances. A delivery was angled across him, Stewart played at it and the ball carried through to Moin Khan. A big appeal went up, but umpire Riazuddin seemed unmoved. Then, after Wasim had already stopped appealing, the umpire lifted his finger with an almost apologetic raise of the eyebrows.</p> <p>Stewart stood transfixed for a moment before slowly trudging off for a golden duck. Replays suggested he probably hadn't touched the ball. It had taken four deliveries - one a no-ball - for the old mistrust between English batsmen and Pakistan umpires to rear its head once more. </p> <p><strong>50-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>Pakistan finished their 50 overs on 304 for 9 in the first one-day international against England at Karachi. They were indebted to Inzamam-ul-Haq, who hit an increasingly powerful 71, and to a gloriously free-flowing 75* off just 40 balls from Abdur Razzaq. </p> <p>Inzamam, who became the fifth player to reach 1000 runs in one-dayers in the 2000 calendar year, and Yousuf Youhana had added 100 for the fourth wicket when Yousuf tried to cut a quicker from one from Darren Gough and gave Alec Stewart his third catch behind the stumps. Yousuf out for a slowish 35 off 64 balls, Pakistan 197 for 4.</p> <p>The 200 came up when Inzamam pulled a short delivery from Mark Ealham through midwicket, but Ealham had his revenge in his next over as Inzamam lapped a full toss straight to Andy Flintoff at midwicket for 71 (219 for 5).</p> <p>Then Razzaq took over. He lifted Ealham for six the ball after rapping him on the shins with a hefty drive, then mowed White over long-on for six more to bring a screaming crowd to its feet. But when Moin tried to repeat the shot, he succeeded only in picking out Vikram Solanki at long-on for a 12-ball 18 (267 for 6).</p> <p>In the 48th over, Wasim Akram was run out by Ashley Giles without facing a ball (271 for 7), Razzaq moved to a superb 29-ball 50, and Waqar Younis was run out for 1 by a direct hit from long-on, again by Giles (277 for 8). </p> <p>But Razzaq was undaunted. In the final over he clouted Gough for six over wide long-on, and although Gough bowled Saqlain with a ball to go, Pakistan had already passed 300. The final six overs had cost 73. England limped off to deafening roars. They will need to score at 6.10 an over.</p> <p><strong>35-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>Inzamam-ul-Haq and Yousuf Youhana came through a sticky period to lay the base for an all-out assault in the final overs in the first one-dayer in Karachi. After 35 overs Pakistan had moved to 169 for 3, with every stroke cheered to the rafters by a capacity crowd of 45,000.</p> <p>Pakistan had found runs hard to come by after losing Salim Elahi (28) and Imran Nazir (30) in quick succession, but Inzamam and Yousuf know all about pacing a one-day knock. They saw off a fiery burst from Darren Gough (Nasser Hussain's policy today has been to give the quicker bowlers short spells) and began to milk the left-arm spin of Ashley Giles without ever really taking him apart.</p> <p>Craig White returned to the attack after five expensive overs for 35 earlier on, and began well, but when he dropped short and wide, Inzamam unfurled his favourite cut shot and the ball raced through point for four. </p> <p>In the next over Inzamam used his feet to thump Giles through mid-on for another boundary to bring up the 150. But Giles was holding his nerve well, and Hussain felt confident enough to bring on Marcus Trescothick in the 32nd over for some gentle changes of pace. </p> <p>Inzamam moved to 50 from 69 balls with a single off Trescothick. If he stayed in, Pakistan were on course for 280 - or more.</p> <p><strong>25-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>England fought back after Pakistan had threatened to run away with things in the first one-dayer at Karachi. With Mark Ealham settling into a rhythm and Andy Caddick making up for a wayward first spell, Pakistan reached 121 for 3 after 25 overs, having scored just 29 in their previous ten.</p> <p>They had started to lose some momentum after the dismissal of the hard-hitting Salim Elahi for 28 (87 for 2). Five tight overs later it was 97 for 3 when Caddick found some in-swing to bowl Imran Nazir middle and leg through the gate for 30. As so often with Caddick, a wicket meant a transformation, and, supported by some exceptional fielding, he and Ealham (6-0-15-1) began to drag England back into it.</p> <p>They were helped by Inazamam-ul-Haq's reluctance to look for quick singles, but on a flat wicket and in searing heat, it was admirable stuff. The 100 came up in the 20th over, and when Inzamam worked an attempted Caddick yorker through mid-on for four, it was Pakistan's first boundary for 58 deliveries.</p> <p>There's plenty of time left for Pakistan to build a big total, but England have at least shown that they can keep things quiet.</p> <p> <strong>15-over bulletin</strong></p> <p>Pakistan got off to a flyer in the first one-day international against England at Karachi. After winning the toss and batting first on the sort of flat wicket England only ever see on their travels, Pakistan raced away to 92 for 2 after 15 overs. It was a reminder that the comfort zone of skittling Zimbabwe and West Indies on greentops can be misleading.</p> <p>Saeed Anwar can be unstoppable when the ball comes on to the bat, and he worked Andy Caddick's second ball to fine leg for four. In the next over, Anwar took three boundaries off Darren Gough, cutting him hard, then flicking him wristily past leg-slip and whipping him through midwicket. After two overs it was 20 for 0 and Anwar had 19 of them.</p> <p>England didn't help their cause by donating four wides - three of them in a row by Caddick - and three no-balls in the first four overs. But then Pakistan didn't really need much help anyway. Imran Nazir, who had edged Caddick just in front of Alec Stewart behind the stumps, cut the same bowler for four, and after six overs it was 39 for 0.</p> <p>Enter Craig White. With his first ball he found Anwar's outside edge and Stewart held on. With Anwar out for 24, it was 39 for 1. Nazir straight-drove Gough for four, and brought up the fifty next ball with a push into the covers for two - a rare example of a Pakistan batsman not trying to hit the cover off the ball.</p> <p>Two overs later Nazir lofted Mark Ealham over long-on for six, while at the other end, Salim Elahi, who took 120 off just 103 balls when England met Pakistan A on Sunday, was starting to enjoy himself too. He worked White to fine-leg for four, and thumped him over mid-on for four more in the same over. The boundaries were flowing now and the crowd were going wild. This was Pakistan.</p> <p>But Ealham struck in the 14th over to restore some control as Elahi top-edged a cut into Stewart's gloves and departed reluctantly for a 24-ball 28 (87 for 2).</p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com.

  "Malake Kafishe was seven months' pregnant and happily looking forward to the birth of her second child. Then, last Thursday night, as on so many nights in Hebron's old city lanes - among the fiercest battle grounds in the West Bank - she heard gunfire. <p>She froze. \"There was shooting, and then I heard the helicopter gunships coming in and my heart just stopped.\" She began to bleed and ran for the stairs, stumbling over the last few rungs and collapsing in a heap on the doorstep. </p> <p>Her family rang for an ambulance. Because of the shooting and a curfew imposed on 40,000 Palestinians in Hebron's old city, it took an hour to arrive. Two soldiers insisted on examining Ms Kafishe. </p> <p>There were four more checkpoints before the ambulance arrived at Alia hospital. At each roadblock, soldiers swung open the vehicle doors and peered at the ashen-faced woman inside. By the time she reached the hospital, a journey that normally takes five minutes, one and a half hours had elapsed. The baby was dead. </p> <p>\"The doctor told me 'If you had got here 20 minutes earlier you could have saved the baby',\" she says. </p> <p>The Kafishes are among the hidden casualties of nearly four weeks of killing. On October 6, in an effort to choke off protests by Palestinians armed with catapults as well as guns, the Israeli army sealed off the the West Bank and Gaza, consigning nearly 3m Palestinians to an open-air prison. </p> <p>In the old city of Hebron - a particularly volatile flashpoint because of the presence of some 200 Jewish settlers in a fortress-like compound - the restrictions are even harsher. Since October 1, Palestinian residents have been under 24-hour curfew and barred from leaving their homes. The Jewish settlers are free to leave at any time. </p> <p>Aside from the Israeli soldiers hunkered down in watch-towers above the Abraham Avinu settlement, or training their guns on the deserted alleys from their sandbagged enclosures on the rooftops of Palestinian houses, the old city of Hebron was like a ghost town yesterday morning. Shops were shuttered and curtains drawn. </p> <p>There was no sign of life until 1pm, when an Israeli jeep equipped with a megaphone rumbled through a market that in normal times is thronged with people, and announced a four-hour reprieve. It was only the fifth break in the curfew in 23 days. </p> <p>Children cooped up for days tumbled into the streets, women in headscarves and long cloaks scurried out to search for food and men congregated at doorways, smoking cigarettes. </p> <p>The ceasefire proclaimed at last week's emergency summit in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh compelled Israel to gradually lift the closure on the West Bank and Gaza. </p> <p>Now, with the ceasefire in tatters, Israel is tightening its grip on Palestinian territories, severing roads to towns and villages with concrete barricades, and sandbags. Nablus, Bethlehem, Jenin and Ramallah are virtually sealed off. </p> <p>In Gaza, which is ringed by an electrified fence, the closure is total. Yesterday, Israel again shut down the strip's airport, severing the territory's last exit to the outside world. </p> <p>Such measures are among the most hated of the occupation, a reminder that despite seven years of self-rule in Gaza and some parts of the West Bank, Israeli troops remain the real masters of Palestinian life. </p> <p>Some 110,000 Palestinians who work in Israel are idle. Thousands more who work in the West Bank simply cannot reach their jobs. </p> <p>The present closure is the most severe since 1996, according to Amira Hass, an Israeli journalist who covers Palestinian affairs for the Ha'aretz newspaper and author of Drinking the Sea at Gaza. \"It is an inner closure now which is even worse. It disconnects all parts of the West Bank from each other. </p> <p>\"Officials in ministries cannot reach their work, teachers cannot reach schools. You can get to places, but it takes twice as long. In effect, the roads belong only to Jews,\" Ms Hass said. </p> <p>Under the wary gaze of an Israeli sentry on the neighbouring rooftop, Nasiha Abu Dahoud is scrubbing her courtyard. Yesterday, she collected two carrier bags of spent ammunition, including a 3-metre roll of machine-gun bullets. </p> <p>Of all the shut-in families of Hebron's old city, hers carries the indignity of being among the poorest. At the best of times her husband, Naif Mohammed, works just one day a week as a labourer, taking home 100 shekels (\u00a318) a time. With her husband out of work for the duration of the curfew, they are penniless. Most days she feeds her family of six just one meal, a bowl of thick soup doled out by a local charity. </p> <p>\"It has been 23 days, and I still cannot understand why,\" she says. </p> <p>\"Sure, there are kids throwing stones, but is that a reason to put 40,000 people in prison? Why can't they just catch those kids and let the rest of us live in peace?\" </p> <p> <b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a <br> </a><a href=\"http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party)<br> </a><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organization of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "When I first travelled to the Holy Land in 1991, the best friend I made was neither Jewish nor Palestinian; he was English. Shahid was a happy-go-lucky school-leaver from Manchester; like thousands of other Britons who travel to Jerusalem each year, he might have been there to backpack or test his mettle on a kibbutz. <p>But he wasn't. Like myself, he was drawn by a very different force - the pull of Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem, \"the farthest mosque\" as it is known in the Koran and the third most sacred site in the Islamic faith. </p> <p>We were here on pilgrimage and our main purpose was to \"connect\" with the place from where, Muslim tradition holds, the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven in a physical affirmation of the spiritual return each soul aspires to make to his Creator. </p> <p>Visiting a region then in the grip of the intifada does not conform to most peoples' idea of a summer getaway. But for us the violence only validated our choice of destination. There was something all the more fascinating about a holy place for which so many of our co-religionists had laid down life and limb. </p> <p>This dimension - the meaning of Jerusalem to Muslims beyond the Arab speaking nations - has been overlooked in recent coverage of the conflict. Israel's conflict is with the whole Muslim world. Every Muslim from Marakesh to Mindanao has an interest in Al-Aqsa. </p> <p>In Yasser Arafat, Israel has been dealing with a man who has been prepared to sign away vast tracts of the Palestinian homeland but who they know hasn't got an inch to manoeuvre when it comes to the status of Al-Aqsa. </p> <p>It's simple. The mosque is not the Palestinians' to give away. Like other mosques, under Islamic law it is the property of God and its administration and security are the collective responsibility of all believers. </p> <p>Shahid and I are fortunate in that Muslims from western countries (barring refusals to such high profile figures as Yusuf Islam, formerly Cat Stevens) are allowed by Israel to visit the country. </p> <p>But it is a dubious honour to know you can worship in a place which is out of bounds not only for the vast majority of the world's Muslims, but for most Palestinians themselves. Forced to endure roadblocks, permit checks and summary arrest if they try to reach Al-Aqsa, they are treated like prisoners in their own land. </p> <p>The most serious outbreaks of violence since the intifada have erupted each time Palestinian Muslims have perceived a new threat to Al-Aqsa. Since the Israeli right makes no secret of its desire to build a new temple on the ruins of the mosque, every incursion is viewed with the utmost suspicion. </p> <p>In 1996 the discovery of more Israeli tunnel excavations under the raised site, which Palestinians say is undermining its foundations, provoked similar unrest. </p> <p>Six years earlier Palestinian attempts to resist an attempt by hard-line Zionists to erect a foundation stone for the new temple led to the bloodiest scenes ever seen on the mosque complex as soldiers ran amok with automatic weapons. </p> <p>There are many religious reasons why Jerusalem is important for Muslims. But for Muslims the occupation of Jerusalem by the Jewish state is also a symbol of how the international world order is stacked against them, representing the prevalence of might over right, imperialism over independence, subjugation over freedom. </p> <p>Among British Muslims, nothing excites passions like a threat to Al-Aqsa, as several demonstrations in Manchester and London have already shown. Some of the most generous supporters of the Palestinian cause, they have dug deep for lobby groups and charities in the hope that helping those closest to Al-Aqsa is an investment in the future of the mosque itself. </p> <p> But as anger and frustration mount and faith in the peace process withers the mood could easily turn militant. On campuses, the festering injustice of Palestine has been the single biggest force responsible for radicalising Muslim students. </p> <p>In the inner cities there is much that the average Muslim youngster has in common with the foot soldiers of the intifada. Jobless, discriminated against, marginalised and devoid of any hope, he too feels victim to a system that appears to exist only to oppress his people. </p> <p>With this time bomb on our doorstep we should be less worried about the conflict putting a few more pennies on fuel than about the likelihood of a major Middle Eastern conflict unleashing an army of angry young men to vent their frustrations on the streets. </p> <p>Muslims find it difficult to distinguish between the west's component parts when it comes to the relationship with Israel. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a <br> </a><a href=\"http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party)<br> </a><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organization of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a><br> <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Ariel Sharon, the Likud party hawk, meets Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, today to try to harvest the maximum political gain from setting off his country's descent into blood and mayhem. <p>As negotiations get under way for the formation of an emergency government to rescue Mr Barak from a crisis that has unfolded with dizzying speed, Mr Sharon made it plain yesterday that he expects a steep price for his support. </p> <p>A two-hour conclave failed to agree the terms of his participation in an emergency government, largely because he is demanding a veto on security decisions and a guarantee that Israel will not return to the negotiating table with the Palestinians. </p> <p>The talks come a day after Mr Barak declared an indefinite time-out in the peace process, following 26 days of violence which have claimed at least 127 lives. The slaughter was provoked by Mr Sharon's visit to the Haram al-Sharif, seen by Palestinians as an intolerable expression of Israel's determination never to relax its grip on the Muslim holy places of occupied Jerusalem. </p> <p>Events continued to unravel on the ground yesterday as the army blockaded Beit Jalla, a Palestinian village on the southern fringes of Jerusalem, after gunmen fired on the nearby Jewish suburb of Gilo. </p> <p>Overnight, tanks opened up with machine guns, and helicopters fired rockets at several buildings, destroying a factory, a church club, and plunging the village and parts of Bethlehem into darkness. There were also gun battles in Hebron, and 36 Palestinians were wounded at a flashpoint in the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>Amid the violence, Shalom Silvan, a Likud party leader, said that Mr Sharon had demanded assurances from Mr Barak that \"two, three months from now\" he would not return to the offers he made at Camp David in July. </p> <p>Mr Sharon is also unwillingly to be a silent partner in this coalition. If Mr Barak wants his party's support, it will have to toe the Likud line, which is fundamentally opposed to the ideals of trading land for peace that have guided the negotiations. </p> <p>Israeli newspapers reported that Mr Sharon was demanding the post of deputy prime minister, with a power of veto over security decisions. \"We are looking for a partnership which would be on an equal basis between the Likud and Labour,\" said Meir Shitreet, a Likud member of the knesset, the Israeli parliament. </p> <p>However, those demands are unacceptable to Mr Barak's Labour party, which reacted with dismay to the prime minister's decision to embrace a man so reviled by Palestinians. </p> <p>It is clear that Mr Sharon and Mr Barak are eager to do a deal as soon as possible. The prime minister, who commands the loyalties of only a quarter of the members of the knesset, is desperate to hang on to power. Mr Sharon is under pressure to head off a possible Likud leadership challenge from the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. </p> <p>The solution may lie in first declaring an emergency government, in which the Likud will simply help shore up the crumbling Mr Barak for a relatively short term of three to four weeks. The next step would be a true government of national unity, in which the Likud would be able to dictate terms. </p> <p>With the violence in the West Bank and Gaza now virtually on the do13orstep of Jewish west Jerusalem, postures are hardening. Although the Palestinians argue that Mr Sharon's participation in the government would signal Israel's abandonment of negotiations, the government remains unmoved. \"I really do not think that Arafat cares about who is in the Israeli government,\" the cabinet secretary, Yitzhak Herzog, said. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a <br> </a><a href=\"http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party)<br> </a><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organization of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "<b>What is the RIP Act?</b> <br> The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act sets out the government's plans for how the security services can monitor and access communication over the internet. It passed into law hours before the Commons rose for its summer break and has now come into force. <p><b>Why is it so controversial?</b><br> Critics say the act is a gross invasion of privacy which will scupper e-commerce in Britain; the government argues it is necessary to crack down on internet crime and paedophilia. </p> <p><b>What are the key areas of controversy?</b> The first is <b>\"black box\" interception</b>. Security services, such as MI5, will be able to monitor people's internet habits through the collection of \"communications data\". This data is not website or email content, but users' \"clickstream\" - the websites and chatrooms they visit and the addresses of emails they send and receive. If security services suspect criminal activity, they request a government warrant to intercept and decode internet content. </p> <p>The Home Office says the interception procedures are in line with the right to privacy enshrined in article eight of the <a href=\"http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/5e.htm\" target=\"_new\">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR - now part of UK law) and simply brings the monitoring of the internet in line with that of telephone calls. All telephone numbers are logged (call content is not) and some telephone companies are required to enable security services to intercept calls. But web addresses also show exactly what people have been looking at and build up detailed profiles of where people go online and who they communicate with.</p> <p>Under RIP, some UK internet service providers (ISPs) will be asked \"to maintain a reasonable intercept capability\". This will come in the form of the much hyped \"black boxes\", a piece of computer technology enabling the security services to monitor the flow of data. Critics say that the black boxes will be hugely expensive and will have <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,333564,00.html\">difficulty keeping pace</a> with fast-changing internet technology as well as the ever-growing volume of internet traffic. </p> <p>The Home Office claims the power of interception is rarely used. All security service warrants for the interception of data will require the personal approval of the home secretary and must meet stringent criteria - national security must be threatened or serious crime must be suspected. Critics prefer an independent judicial panel, which would provide external checks on the system and ensure spies and governments maintain the rule of law. </p> <p>The second key controversy is the legislation's <b>reverse burden of proof</b>. If intercepted communications are encrypted (encoded and made secret), the act will force the individual to surrender the keys (pin numbers which allow users to decipher encoded data), on pain of jail sentences of up to two years. The government says keys will only be required in special circumstances and promises that the security services will destroy the keys as soon as they are finished with.</p> <p>Human rights campaigners argue the act reverses the burden of proof in UK law. There is also the threat of stiff prison sentences if an individual who has been required to hand over keys tells a third party. However, the Home Office says the burden remains on the prosecution to prove \"beyond reasonable doubt that an accused person is, or has been, in possession of a key to unlock particular protected data.\" The act also contains a defence for individuals who have lost or forgotten a key, and a person is no longer liable if they are judged to have done all they can to help the authorities to recover a key.</p> <p>Critics argue that innocent people could still be jailed for innocently forgetting keys, while drug smugglers and paedophiles would happily settle for a two-year prison sentence rather than face far harsher penalties for being found guilty of the crime they are suspected of.</p> <p><b>What about employers?</b><br> The act also allows employers to intercept emails and internet use by their staff, on grounds such as monitoring for computer viruses. </p> <p><b>Will the act compromise e-commerce?</b><br> Many in business fear the act will scare off e-commerce entrepreneurs. A fiercely critical British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) report estimates the RIP Act could cost business \u00a346bn in the first five years of operation, as ISPs are compelled to install costly black boxes, e-commerce firms are forced out of the country and new firms are dissuaded from basing their operations in the UK.</p> <p>The act's potential to enable unlimited \"fishing expeditions\" in companies' databases compromises corporate privacy, they argue, while security service knowledge of clickstreams and encryption keys could fall into criminal hands, compromising the security of e-commerce. Forcing employees to secretly hand over encryption keys could also breach trust and rules within a company. </p> <p>In turn, the home secretary, <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Jack Straw</a>, says the BCC's figures are \"incredible\" given that the value of UK e-commerce is currently estimated at around \u00a35bn. He prefers to highlight what he says is the overall cost of crime - \u00a350bn a year.</p> <p><b>What do other countries do?</b><br> There is no comparable legislation in the US. Tim Berners-Lee, the British inventor of the world wide web, has said that RIP would have been thrown out of the US \"in a second\". Ireland recently sought to encourage e-commerce by passing a law making it illegal for government to access commercial encryption keys. France has relaxed controls on domestic encryption, while Germany is opposed to restrictions on citizens' use of encryption. Russia, Singapore and Malaysia have passed laws similar to RIP.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.fipr.org/rip/\" target=\"_new\">RIP centre - Foundation for Information Policy Research</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldbills/061/2000061.htm\" target=\"_new\">The RIP bill</a><br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/oicd/ripbill.htm\" target=\"_new\">The Home Office RIP site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/newsandpolicy/ict/index.html\" target=\"_new\">The British Chambers of Commerce information and communication technology page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2000/rp00-025.pdf\" target=\"_new\">House of Commons library research report (pdf)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm\" target=\"_new\">The Human Rights Act 1998 (enshrines the ECHR into British law)</a></p>",
  "<p>The Maben-Mead family have been waiting a long time to fly to Australia, but later this week they will finally leave. After a massive fundraising effort, Jill Maben and Robert Mead are taking their eight-year-old son George to Melbourne in the hope that pioneering brain surgery, not currently available in the UK, will remove a rare form of tumour and transform his quality of life. </p> <p>It is certainly not the first time that friends, family and volunteers have rallied round to support an exhausting wave of sponsored walks, jumble sales and raffles in a bid to raise thousands of pounds to cover the costs of \"miracle\" medical treatment on the other side of the world which is not offered by the NHS. American hospitals, in particular, have been marketing themselves aggressively to vulnerable British patients - particularly to candidates for brain-tumour surgery - even though the outcomes on both sides of the Atlantic have been more or less the same. </p> <p>George has a rare benign tumour, known as a hypothalamic hamartoma, deep inside his brain in the region which controls mood, appetite, thirst, sleep and hormones. The little-known condition has given him severe learning and behavioural difficulties, and up to 15 epileptic seizures a day. There is no known cure, apart from complex surgery to remove the tumour - and even that has been largely unsuccessful, under techniques used in Britain. </p> <p>Then, through an international support group on the internet, Jill and Robert learned of pioneering micro-surgery with a high success rate at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. With the encouragement of the surgeons they have talked to all 12 of the previous patients, and their son is due to undergo surgery next month. </p> <p>George talks like a four-year-old and cannot read or write. His motor skills are poor, though like many people with autism - another effect of his condition - he has an amazing memory, able to recite parrot fashion all the names of his vast video collection. \"George's quality of life at the moment is already very poor,\" Robert says. \"He has no friends of his own age and no interest at all in going out or meeting other people. His world revolves around his Postman Pat and Disney videos. Without the operation, there is no doubt that his condition would deteriorate further.\" </p> <p>The normal development of George's younger sister Lola, who at 19 months is just saying her first words, makes the pain greater still. Though George attends a special school in Essex, some distance from the family's home in Hackney, east London, looking after him is so demanding that Robert has given up his job in a respite home, and spends much time teaching George in a specially-designed playroom in the family's garden. The couple raised the \u00a316,500 needed for the operation in three months, though they must still raise \u00a33,500 to cover accommodation, travel and other expenses. </p> <p>It took three years before George's condition was diagnosed. He appeared slow to develop, and did not walk until he was 18 months old; his speech, when it came at age two, was largely restricted to single words. The local clinic talked of \"general global delay\", and George was investigated for hearing loss and provided with speech therapy. But it was the first major seizure - in the middle of the night, with three of them in the bed - that sounded the alarm. </p> <p>A scan revealed a tumour, and neurologists at Great Ormond Street hospital in London said the rest of the brain appeared normal. Only then did his parents realise that George's odd, staccato-like cries as a baby - which everyone had called \"cute\" - had actually been minor seizures. </p> <p>George was born with the tumour, which grows at the same rate as his brain and is now up to 2cm across. Its presence causes him to have a very rare form of \"gelastic\" epilepsy which results in 10 to 15 \"laughing seizures\" every day as a result of constant electrical activity. </p> <p>Great Ormond Street told them George's condition was inoperable, and energies were directed towards \"symptom management\", keeping his seizures under control by regular medication. But it was a lonely and difficult time for Jill, herself trained as a nurse, who started extensive research in search of information. \"It was a relief to find that there was something there. But I remember sitting in the British Library and reading about 'cognitive decline' in relation to gelastic epilepsy. It was all extremely depressing.\" </p> <p>Next, Jill turned to the internet, and after several months traced six other families whose children had the same kind of tumour. Without treatment, George's epilepsy would be likely to worsen, possibly even leading to \"drop seizures\", where a person literally drops to the ground and risks serious injury; but with the radical Australian surgery - involving a delicate five-hour operation through a 2cm incision in the top of the head - the tumour will be removed completely and, if successful, will end the seizures while also halting learning decline. </p> <p>By the time the surgeon involved, Professor Jeffrey Rosenfeld, sees George next month, he will have operated on 12 children, all of whom are virtually seizure-free. The most recent surgery was carried out just two weeks ago. </p> <p>Jill admits that her own medical background was a help in researching the operation. \"But one of the most important things for us is being able to communicate with other families via the internet, including the 12 whose children have had the surgery in Australia,\" she says. \"Instead of feeling that we were on our own, it has been great to share the experience with so many other people. And the surgeons even sent us their own CVs. The whole thing has been a very open and transparent process.\" </p> <p>Apart from the fact that techniques used in the UK have a lower success rate - sometimes leading to complications such as strokes - NHS funding restrictions would inevitably have meant a long wait for any surgery here, and Jill and Robert do not have time on their side. \"We would rather take George to Australia where there is a proven track record and increasing experience of this very complex brain surgery and where we can get surgery immediately,\" Jill explains. </p> <p>\"We can't risk a further wait which could lead to further deterioration. There is the prospect of a very complex operation and five hours on the operating table, not to mention 26 hours on the plane, which for George is not going to be easy. This is not something we would do lightly.\" </p> <p>George's neurologist at Great Ormond Street, Professor Brian Neville, has been supportive, though he stops short of recommending the surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital says: \"We cannot recommend this operation because it is quite a new procedure which has not had any long-term follow up. But the surgical team in Australia is very highly respected, and we fully support the right of the family to make this decision.\" </p> <p>Now, as they wait to leave, Jill and Robert are, understandably, in an emotional state. \"We are experiencing a mixture of excitement and worry,\" Jill says. \"We don't want to raise our hopes too much. But we are quite tenacious. It is the next, and ultimate step in improving George's quality of life. We could wait another five years for the surgery to be refined in this country, but that is an awfully long time in George's life.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Updates of George's progress will be posted on the web at <a href=\"http://www.gap3.com\">www.gap3.com</a>.</p>",
  "On the dubious premise that newspaper endorsements sway public opinion in US presidential campaigns, both main candidates can at least take comfort that they are being supported in print in their home states. <p>No doubt there are pockets of Democrats lurking in Texas, but they are not terribly visible in the local press. An admittedly quick survey indicates solid support for George W. Bush, encapsulated in the admirably crisp endorsement of the <a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Dallas Morning News:</a> \"The Texas Republican could create a less partisan government, restore integrity to the White House and usher in a progressive-conservative era.

So does an indignant reader's letter, which accuses the paper of \"coddling\" Bush, and indeed everyone else wearing a Republican teeshirt. </p> <p>In Tennessee, Al Gore's state, they do things differently, and not many of the newspapers surveyed offer anything as vulgar as a straight endorsement. The marvellously named <a href=\"http://www.timesfreepress.com/\" target=\"_new\">Chattanooga Times and Free Press</a> is an exception: \"Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have been telling us for some time that this election is about important differences between them. On this point both are right. Mr. Bush proposes a hands-off government that essentially would further enrich wealthier people and give little more than lip service to the needs of ordinary Americans. Mr. Gore actually would roll up his sleeves and work to help Americans take care of their families and improve their education, health care and economic opportunities.\" (Lest this be thought the vapourings of some bleeding-heart liberal rag, the same paper carries a shrill warning that China is preparing for war with the United States.) </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.knoxnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Knoxville News-Sentinel </a> speaks with the authentic sceptical voice of middle America when it urges voters to think carefully about the lavish promises of education spending by both candidates: \"By the time the Republican Congress finishes caving in to President Clinton, federal spending on education could be close to $43 billion, 20 percent more than last fiscal year. The two major party presidential candidates, Al Gore and George W. Bush, promise to spend even more. Clearly, the political consensus is that federal aid to education is a winning issue, but there is a larger, less obvious issue here that is not being addressed: The extent of federal control over public education, by long tradition a purely local responsibility.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://miva.jacksonsun.com/\" target=\"_new\">Jackson Sun</a>, while keeping its preferences primly to itself, carries ominous news for the local hero.

  "It took three and a half years to get round to, and followed increasing pressure from deeply frustrated green groups and big business. But in the end Tony Blair's first speech about the environment since taking office was little more than an emollient rallying call for everyone to come together to address what he called the most pressing and urgent problems of the day. <p>His 35-minute speech to the Confederation of British Industry and the Green Alliance was short on new initiatives - \u00a3150m over three years should marginally boost renewable technologies - but long on why Britain had to move environment up the political agenda.</p> <p>No one could disagree with the sentiment and Blair sought largely to appease increasingly warring parties. There was no contradiction, he argued, between impatient green groups and Britain's drive for prosperity, or between science and the environment. </p> <p>Urging all sectors to work together to harness science and the market to protect the environment, he suggested: \"We could be richer by being greener; and by being greener we would enrich the quality of our lives.\" In fact, he went no further than Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, who has called for a green industrial revolution, or Gordon Brown, who has recognised that green taxes can penalise wrong-doers and reward companies who address environmental problems. </p> <p>But his acknowledgement that global warming was alarming, that millions face drought and disease, that population growth was still a major issue, that wetlands and forests systems were being destroyed and that the global use of resources were unsustainable, made all the right noises.</p> <p>But that was it. Vague talk about moving to a carbon-free economy: but no great change of direction; no substantial new initiatives; no new targets or timetables; nothing to worry polluting business or consumers; no tighter regulations. Just pats on the back for Michael Meacher and Stephen Byers, big business and oil companies who were, he said, getting to grip with the problems; some recognition of the role of green groups; and a pluralistic big-tent vision whereby a combination of education and sensible progress would somehow right the wrongs. </p> <p>Labour's faith in technology and prosperity to get the world out of an admitted crisis is touching, but naive. Technologies in fuel efficiency, carbon-free buildings, pollution control, waste management and environmental remediation are moving ahead fast, but almost all UN research and other indicators suggest the global and national situation is fast worsening for billions of people. Green groups such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth are already working successfully with business. </p> <p>For all the new talk about putting environment at the heart of government, there is little sign of the radical, specific action that almost everyone except the government recognises is needed. The money is there, the need is there, the understanding is there and so are many of the solutions. Environment has all the potential to be the Big Idea of a second Blair administration. But it remains a dream.</p>",

  "<p>Henry Blofeld has struck another blow for cricket's bold, modern image in his new autobiography (A Thirst for Life, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a318.99). Blowers, over-30 years a commentator, has decided that the time has come for him to get something off his chest. Something that has been bugging him for a while. Because much as he loves having women in the box with him (and there have, as you can imagine, been hundreds) \"no-one has yet convinced me that they add more to the commentary than we [men] already have.\" </p> <p>In fact, says Blowers,\"It is perhaps another example of women striving regardless to do anything and everything men used to do on their own.\" (A good test in these circumstances is to substitute the word blacks and whites for women and men - ouch, that hurts doesn't it.) </p> <p>How scandalous that women might want to be able to do the same things as men. To have the same opportunities. And to want to be a cricket commentator really is taking things too far. Next stop, the sperm bank. But even Blowers would have to admit that women on the radio are a good thing - Libby Purves, Sue McGregor, Kate Adie. And that women talking about sport on the radio hasn't exactly been an unmitigated disaster - think Eleanor Oldroyd or Claire Balding. So what is so different about cricket? Perhaps those laws are a little complicated for our pretty little heads. Perhaps we haven't got the concentration for five days. Perhaps we might giggle (\"The batsman's Holding, the bowler's Willey\") and lower the tone.</p> <p>Surely Blowers is missing the point. If the entire Test Match Special box consisted of men of his patrician, fruity tones, he wouldn't be so well loved, or such a novelty in places like Australia. It is the mix of people, the interaction between the team that makes TMS so wonderfully addictive. No-one would now dream of having a commentary team which consisted entirely of people who went to Eton. Not that they wouldn't be any good, just that they would alienate some sections of the audience and would tend to have a certain outlook on life.</p> <p>TMS employed a woman commentator in the summer - Donna Symmonds, the lawyer who runs an all-female law practice in Barbados. She has come joint fifth (with Dermot Reeve) in the favourite-commentator section of Wisden Cricket Monthly's Readers' Poll, to be published in full in December's issue. Not everyone loves her of course. Some find her intensely irritating. But so what? That, surely is the whole point. Different voices for different people.</p> <p>Women <em>are </em>increasingly being heard talking about cricket. Sarah Potter has done women's matches for Sky, Karen Smithies for TMS and Clare Connor for CricInfo.</p> <p>Ralph Dellor, the director of cricket operations at CricInfo says: \"Providing they reach the required criteria, our commentators can be white, black, asian, male, female. We like a variety of voices. But I will employ whoever is best to do the job. I won't have women just for a token or for a novelty and I don't subscribe to the school of thought of gosh isn't it clever we've got a woman.\" </p> <p>Fair enough. Quota systems aren't for everyone. You can't even get a roomful of women to agree upon them, let alone men. But the major cricket stations must have searched high and low for a female voice this winter, especially after the success of Sybil Ruscoe on Channel 4.</p> <p>How many women will be commentating on the forthcoming Test series in Pakistan? Talk Radio have a female producer, Claire Furlong, who sometimes does off-field snippets. But as for women commentators - forget it. Sky? Despite the female faces of their sports' news coverage, there will be no women playing a straight bat or otherwise. From the proposed CricInfo team, proud sponsors of the Women's World Cup? None.</p> <p>Not one of the three British teams covering the cricket could find a single woman who would be willing and able to commentate on England's return to Pakistan. I wonder how hard they looked.</p> <p><em>Tanya Aldred is assistant editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

  "The French-owned rail company Connex will today become the first victim of the industry's strengthened regulatory regime when it is stripped of one of its operating franchises. <p>The announcement will be highlighted by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, as an indication of the government's determination to improve the country's beleaguered rail infrastructure in the aftermath of last week's crash at Hatfield. </p> <p>Connex's south central franchise is expected to be removed after a period in which it has been awarded poor grades by the shadow strategic rail authority. Commuters and rail passenger groups have consistently criticised its poor punctuality and dirty rolling stock. </p> <p>Connex has pledged more than \u00a31bn for improved services for the suburban services from London to Surrey and Sussex, but the SSRA is unconvinced that its plans will work. It lies ninth in the list of the 25 rail companies. Connex will continue to operate its south-east franchise and wants the opportunity to continue expanding in the UK. </p> <p>The removal of the franchise, which is expected to be handed over to the rival Go-Ahead company, will be seized on by Mr Prescott in his first Commons statement since the Hatfield crash as an example of the new power of the industry's regulatory control. </p> <p>But the SSRA has been given little room for manoeuvre in deciding who should get the franchise. The other bidder, Go-Ahead, is involved with Thames Trains, which was associated with last year's Paddington rail crash in which 31 people died. But it also operates the largely successful Thameslink services from Luton to Brighton, for which it receives no subsidy. </p> <p>Mr Prescott is likely to emphasise that safety is of paramount importance and that Lord Cullen's forthcoming report into the Paddington rail crash will set new guidelines for the next decade. </p> <p>Lord Cullen's report is expected to result in the setting up of a independent national rail safety authority for Britain, similar to the airline industry, which is supervised by the Civil Aviation Authority. The move against Connex follows yesterday's decision by Tom Winsor, the rail regulator, to give an extra \u00a3855m of taxpayers' money to Railtrack to make the railways safe. But it must improve its performance. </p> <p>In his first comments since the Hatfield crash, in which four people died, Mr Winsor said that one of the causes was the failure of Railtrack and its contractor, Balfour Beatty, to communicate with each other about the state of the track at Hatfield. </p> <p>The \u00a3855m is part of a \u00a314.9bn package that Railtrack will be allowed to spend on improvements over the next five years. The money will come from \u00a330bn set aside by the chancellor for rail spending in his financial announcement in July. </p> <p>Mr Winsor said Railtrack would spend \u00a38bn of the \u00a314.9bn on maintenance, renewal and replacement of track and signalling. Of this, \u00a33.5bn would go on track maintenance, with \u00a3150m to reduce the number of broken rails. Maintenance and renewal of signalling systems would account for \u00a34bn, while \u00a3500m would be spent on the train protection warning system supposed to stop trains passing through signals on red at up to 70mph. </p> <p>The review is the first since privatisation and it will operate until 2006. The review says that the regulator will consider a target for Railtrack to reduce the number of broken rails from an expected figure of 765 in this financial year to 615 by 2006. This figure may be tightened following a consultant's report due to be handed to Mr Winsor next month. </p> <p>If Railtrack fails to meet this target it could be penalised by \u00a380,000 for each broken rail. Conversely, it would receive \u00a380,000 for every broken rail fixed beyond the 615 target. </p> <p>Mr Winsor said: \"Railtrack has to to improve its performance. It has an obligation to run a safe railway and that is what it must do.\" </p> <p> </p>",

  "There are at points real conflict between the immediate interests of consumption and the longer term interests of the environment; and to be frank, between the politicans' need to woo the electorate a well as lead them. <p>My point is simply this. We must work at resolving these conflicts or finding a way through. And we should recognise that to be environmentally conscious isn't a punishment. It is indeed in our long term interests; and it can also be of benefit, short and medium term too. What's more there is a real concern and desire amongst our people, within realistic bounds, to do the right thing. We have children and granchildren. </p> <p>We care for them. We know that despoiling the environment today will mean hardship, even death for them tomorrow. Call it idealism or even just family values: there is an energy and commitment there we can harness. </p> <p>Where 15 years ago many thought that there would always be a trade-off between progress and the environment, we can now see a way through. What becomes clear is that to preserve what we value most - our local environment, the countryside around us - we must protect the whole earth, and do so by pioneering new ways of building, working, living. New technologies to deliver a low carbon economy; to use our finite resources more efficiently, to reform national and international institutions and create positive incentives to be green. </p> <p>In short, we don't halt progress and retreat into the past, nor do we carry on regardless. Instead we take pride in our progress. Using our creativity in partnership to protect the environment. </p> <p><b>The threat</b> </p> <p>We have made a lot of progress over this Parliament. Through John Prescott's leadership, and the hard work of Michael here on the platform with me, we can point to measurable achievements. We are on track to meet our Kyoto targets. Air quality is improving. London now has the cleanest river of any major city. </p> <p>But we have to face a stark fact. Neither we here in Britain, nor our partners abroad, have succeeded in reversing the overall destructive trend. The environmental challenge continues to grow and become more urgent: </p> <p>\u0095 There are alarming changes in our atmosphere, in global temperatures, in weather patterns, in sea levels and in the protective ozone layer. As a result, across the world millions face drought, flooding, disease. Here in the UK we too face threats - the prospect of exotic diseases becoming commonplace, of increased levels of skin cancer, of floods in some years, droughts in others, of low lying areas being swallowed by the sea. </p> <p>\u0095 Global population growth will put increased pressure on natural resources. The world pop is set to rise from 6bn to 9bn by 2050. So that economies across the world have the opportunity to develop, we must all use resources far more efficiently and switch to clean technologies. </p> <p>\u0095 Fresh water is being polluted or simply used up. Demand is doubling every 21 years while supply is broadly unchanged. </p> <p>\u0095 Soil degradation has affected two-thirds of the world's agricultural lands over the last 50 years, and the situation is getting worse. </p> <p>\u0095 Half the world's wetlands have been lost over the past century and with them their unique plants and animals; and this is accelerating </p> <p>\u0095 One in ten of the world's tree species are at risk of extinction, and increasingly whole forest systems are under threat </p> <p>\u0095 Fishing fleets are still 40 per cent larger than the oceans can sustain and yet it still benefits from subsidies, world wide </p> <p>\u0095 Here in the UK farmland birds are disappearing, the house sparrow, once more cockney than the Cockneys, is now a rarity in London, and congestion means that urban traffic moves at the same speed as in 1890. </p> <p>Of two things I am certain. We are not going to turn this round unless we re-engage the political system on the importance of the environmental challenge. We are not going to be able to engage consumers and business unless we offer them a positive agenda. </p> <p><b>A new approach to the environment</b> </p> <p>We need to build a new coalition for the environment, a coalition that works with the grain of consumers, business and science, not against them. A coalition that harnesses consumer demand for a better environment, and encourages businesses to see the profit of the new green technologies. and a coalition that stretches across national frontiers. </p> <p>The central theme of our approach is a more productive use of environmental resources. It is clear that if we are to continue to grow, and share the benefits of that growth; we must reduce the impact of growth on the environment. Some commentators estimate that we'll need a tenfold increase in the efficiency with which we use resources by 2050 only to stand still. Above all, we need to be clear about our priorities, and the principles that underlie our approach: </p> <p>\u0095 First, the greatest threat to our environment today is climate change. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution has said that the UK will have to cut the CO2 we produce by 60% by 2050 if we are to slow down the pace of change. If there is one immediate issue that threatens global disaster, it is the changes in our atmosphere. </p> <p>\u0095 Second, problems need to be addressed at the right level. A problem like climate change requires international as well as national action. The reason for taking the lead in cutting national emissions, as we have in the UK, is to give us the standing and authority in international negotiations. And developed countries, as the principle producers of greenhouse gases, should set an example for developing ones. </p> <p>\u0095 Third, we should harness consumer demand, not stifle it. We should not be trying to reduce people's aspirations, but rather find innovative ways of satisfying those aspirations. As our societies become more prosperous, so people's demand for a better environment is growing. More and more people want to buy green. We should encourage that, and harness that green consumer power in our environmental policies </p> <p>\u0095 Fourth, we must stimulate science and innovation. I reject the pessimistic notion that most environmental problems can only be managed, not solved. Technological advance does offer opportunities, particularly to counter climate change and provide alternatives to finite energy resources. </p> <p>\u0095 Fifth, we need to use environmental resources more efficiently and to become a low-carbon, recycling economy. We need to become much more effective about how we use finite resources. Stephen Byers set out a radical new direction in his speech to Greenpeace's Business Conference earlier this month, focussing on resource productivity and the Government's programme to boost renewable energy. </p> <p>\u0095 Lastly, we should see protecting the environment as a business opportunity. There is a growing market for environmental goods and services - currently worth an amazing US$335 billion - as large as the world market for pharmaceuticals or aerospace. I am not saying that the interests of business and the environment have become identical. But we should exploit them and develop them when they are. Otherwise, history shows us the environment risks being the loser. </p> <p><b>New Labour's Green Agenda</b> </p> <p>I make no apology for the priority we have given education, health and crime. Yet no other British Government has had a Deputy Prime Minister in charge of environment policy. And no other British Government has put the environment at the heart of its policy-making across the board - from foreign affairs to the national curriculum - in the way this Government has. Since 1997, we have: </p> <p>\u0095 Taken a lead internationally, as at Kyoto. \u0095 Introduced an air quality strategy going beyond even the tough new European standards \u0095 Cleaned up decades of pollution of our beaches and rivers, and given greater protection to important wildlife sites \u0095 Factored environmental considerations into all our legislation and policy, from the Utilities Act to innovative fiscal measures such as incentives and hypothecation \u0095 And as a result of the Comprehensive Spending Review, started to invest billions in transport to increase choice and cut congestion and pollution </p> <p>Yet I would be the first to say that there is still a lot more we could and will do. </p> <p>John Prescott will shortly publish the final version of our strategy on Climate Change. It will set out how Britain plans to deliver its international obligations to cut greenhouse gases by 12.5% and move towards a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions. This will include a 10% target for energy from renewables by 2010. </p> <p>As part of the Climate Change Levy package, businesses will be able to claim capital allowances for investments they make in energy-saving technologies from next April. I can also announce that we will shortly be launching a new Carbon Trust in Britain that will channel up to \u00a350 million a year developing low-carbon technology, partly funded from the Climate Change Levy. We have worked closely with business and the research community since their participation is vital to the Trust's long-term success. The Trust will take the lead on low-carbon technology and innovation in this country, and put Britain in the lead internationally. </p> <p>We will also be setting up an office to export Britain's low-carbon technologies, the Kyoto Mechanisms Office. This was suggested to me at a meeting I had on climate change with business leaders earlier this year. By encouraging the private sector to invest in innovative energy projects abroad, it will help tackle climate change and allow British business to seize new opportunities. The Office will start work in April 2001. </p> <p>Next Spring, we will be launching the first national CO2 emissions trading system anywhere in the world. Emissions trading is one of the most powerful ways of harnessing the market to cut greenhouse gases. The trading system will set overall limits on emissions for CO2 producers entering the system, and allow them to trade \"emission allowances\" amongst themselves, to the profit of the cleanest factories and companies. </p> <p>If we are to reduce our dependence on oil and high-carbon energy, we will need to develop commercially viable renewable energy. I believe government has a key role to play in assisting business build up the economies of scale in these new technologies so that they can compete effectively. Today, we are announcing proposals for \u00a350 million from the New Opportunities Fund to support offshore wind and biomass. The DTI is already providing \u00a339 million for new offshore wind turbines, and the first are about to go into operation off Blyth. Helen Liddle has set up a task force to examine ways of promoting solar energy. And I have also asked the Performance and Innovation Unit to undertake a comprehensive study into the future of renewable energy, with a view to increasing substantially our long-term investment. </p> <p>Any environmental policy has to address the implications of the car. Transport produces around 25% of global CO2 and rising. Making public transport more attractive will take us only so far. The long-term solution is to make vehicles cleaner and more fuel efficient. That is why we have used the tax system to roll out cleaner fuels. Lead in petrol is now a thing of the past, and we are now using tax incentives to promote ultra-low sulphur petrol. Through the EU, we have persuaded manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency by 25%. Vehicle Excise Duty is now linked to vehicle emissions for the first time. Toyota and Honda are now selling \"hybrid\" cars which are twice as efficient as conventional models. Honda's Insight does 80 mpg. Fuel cell powered electric cars will offer even more - truly pollution-free motoring. Both Mercedes and Ford plan to have them in the showrooms by 2004. </p> <p>We will also be doing more to protect Britain's urban and rural environment. Our Countryside and Rights of Way Bill will protect wildlife and sites of special scientific interest. In our forthcoming Rural White Paper we will set out policies for a living countryside which is economically vibrant, conserves wildlife and landscapes and which everyone can enjoy. And the Urban White Paper will set out our National Strategy for Neighbourhood renewal. We are also proposing that the New Opportunities Funds should invest another \u00a350 million for quality of life in urban and rural settlements and for green spaces. </p> <p>On recycling, we want to do more to harness the power of the market. The new Waste Resource Action Programme, led by business, will develop markets for recycled materials. A proposed further 50 million pounds from The New Opportunities Fund will help provide kerbside recycling for 700,000 households. I want to see every local authority offering doorstep recycling to take advantage of these new markets. And the office co-ordinating government procurement will soon begin trialling the purchasing of recycled products, using government purchasing to expand the market. </p> <p>On regulation, our aim must be to raise environmental standards without imposing unnecessary burdens on business. Often, the most effective approach to raising standards is a cross-border one. That is why we are working with the European Commission and other member states to improve the regulatory process in Europe. </p> <p>This brings me to environmental diplomacy. The international climate change negotiations remain a key government priority, and we will be taking a leading role in The Hague next month. I also want to extend the EU's economic reform agenda to new energy saving technologies. And I can announce today that I plan to attend the next Earth Summit in 2002, and I will be encouraging other world leaders to join us there. </p> <p><b>Business, technology and the environment</b> </p> <p>Fifteen years ago, if you said business will help save the environment people would have laughed at you. Today, I believe that is a serious proposition. </p> <p>As BP's John Browne has said, the enlightened company increasingly recognises that there are good commercial reasons for being ahead of the pack when it comes to issues to do with the environment. </p> <p>Environmentally-aware oil companies are finding ways to recapture the CO2 produced by plant and equipment and pump it back underground to enhance the recovery of oil. They are working with car manufacturers on new technologies, from developing fuel cell cars, to putting hydrogen-powered buses on the road in Europe. </p> <p>Shell is playing a major role in the move away from oil in power generation. Like its competitor BP, it is investing heavily in solar power. ABB recently shifted its focus from being a builder of traditional large-scale power plants to focus on small scale renewable technologies. It expects alternative energy solutions to account for US$1 billion worth of business for the company within the next five years. </p> <p>It is increasingly clear that energy generation in the future will become a spectrum: from the cleaner extraction of energy from fossil fuels; through the move from liquid to cleaner gas fuels; new technologies that convert hydrocarbon fuels into energy without combustion; to, at its greenest end, the carbon free technologies of wind and solar. </p> <p>The City and investment community is beginning to recognise the new commercial and environmental realities, and to make money out of them. The return on equity of the new Dow Jones Sustainability Group Index averaged 15%, compared to 8% for the regular index for the first half of this year. And more individual investors are choosing ethical investment portfolios which reflect their values. Legislation earlier this year on Statements of Investment Principles required pension funds for the first time to disclose whether they take ethical, environmental or social factors into account in their decisions. </p> <p>The World Business Council on Sustainable Development, of which many of you here today are members, is driving forward the agenda to increase the efficient use of resources. I would also like to see more reporting on environmental and social performance. The pioneers of environmental reporting - companies like BA, BT, British Gas, and BP - are seeing increasing benefits from both improved efficiencies and public image as a result. This is something that all companies should be doing, and I am issuing a challenge, today, to all of the top 350 companies to be publishing annual environment reports by the end of 2001. </p> <p><b>The role of civil society</b> </p> <p>Increasingly, NGOs are also putting more and more energy into offering solutions in partnership with business and government. </p> <p>For example, the Worldwide Fund for Nature and Unilever have set up the Marine Stewardship Council to protect our endangered fish stocks. Thames Water and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust have converted redundant reservoirs and treatment at Barn Elms into a fantastic new wildlife habitat. Fourteen companies, eight NGOs and three Government departments are working together on the Digital Futures project, to try to ensure that the e-commerce revolution happens in the most environmentally friendly way possible. And eight years ago Greenpeace began research on Greenfreeze refrigeration technology to reduce the destruction of the Ozone layer. It is now a highly successful example of green organisation and industry working together for the benefit of the Ozone layer. Coca Cola and Unilever have just announce they will move towards such alternative refrigerants such as Greenfreeze by 2005. </p> <p>Government, business, the NGOs and the public need to move forward together. That is why we have set up the new Sustainable Development Commission. I have asked Jonathan Porritt to chair it and I am very pleased to launch it today. The members, drawn from business, local government, pressure groups and academia, will build a consensus, monitor our progress, and suggest ways we can reconcile the needs of the environment, the economy and society. </p> <p><b>Conclusion</b> </p> <p>So the outlook is not all bleak. There is real progress. But it is a race against time, lethargy, and indifference. It is an urgent issue. People feel it; but they don't always know how to make a difference. </p> <p>Millions of people around the country are \"green\" in their actions, their beliefs, what they care about. They want the air they breath to be fresh. They want the countryside they live in or visit to be protected. They have respect for the world around them - hate cruelty to animals, hate the destruction of natural beauty. They want their neighbourhoods to have parks and be free from litter, grafitti, kids with nothing to do, and crime. Millions recycle, more would like to. Millions of children care passionately about the environment. That is their politics. But they need to know the \"how\" as well as the \"why\". </p> <p>The root of my political beliefs is the idea of community: of solidarity. Today such an idea can only live on, based on mutual rights and responsibilities. The essence of environmental politics is the notion of responsibility to nature and future generations to protect and enhance the environment. Its why we wrote it into the new Clause IV of our Party Constitution. </p> <p>We have to show how this strongly held belief can translate into practical action. To do that, we need a partnership between government, business and the environmental movement, to extend the frontiers of progress, to show the way through. We need more understanding, more dialogue, a healthy recognition of areas of disagreement, and then a common campaign of explanation, to put across the urgency of the problems and the viability of the solutions. </p> <p>We have one common aim: to show how by doing good to the environment, we enrich our lives, in quality and prosperity. Concern for the environment is not a yoke on our necks. It is the lifting of the yoke. The burden is lighter. The way is clearer. I believe it can be done. </p> <p>Let's sell the new insight - we can be richer by being greener; and by being greener we will enrich the quality of our lives. </p>",
  "<p>Over the past month you will probably have been looking at the murder and mayhem in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza and asking yourselves what kind of people can behave like this? The killing of children, deliberately targeted - what kind of a person could commit such an act? What sort of people could, for years on end, deny the basic human rights of an oppressed nation? And the answer might come to you, for want of any other: heartless, monsters, that's who. </p> <p>I also watch the news, just as desperate and heart-sick, but I do, however, know exactly who is on the other side of those guns, and who is sitting at home in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv watching the events on Israeli television - and why they fail to rise up in rage against their government for perpetrating all this in their name. </p> <p>I went to Israel five times in less than two years, not as a journalist or a tourist or a human rights worker but as a novelist. I didn't go to Gaza or the West Bank because the object of my research - the Jewish war against the British in Tel Aviv in 1946 - wasn't going to be found in either of those places. I didn't set out to discuss the then peace process, but you can't go to Israel without getting an earful, in cafes, buses, taxis. I listened with the ear of a novelist. The psychology of the Israelis was what I wanted to understand. When you ask, why, in Israel, you are asking for a political explanation but the why goes far deeper - the politics is a symptom. I was left with three strong impressions. </p> <p>The first, and easiest to explain, is the mentality of the religious right. In the past month I have read time and again the statement, \"The Jews stole the Palestinians' country, it's as simple as that.\" To the Orthodox however, the facts are the exact opposite. They have the deeds to the country. You probably have a copy, as it happens, in your own home. Take it down from the shelf. It's the first part you want, the Old Testament, and the first chapter, Genesis, which contains the world's first recorded real-estate deal: \"And I will give to thee and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession.\" And if you want to know where that is, here are the ground plans, the map: \"Unto this seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.\" </p> <p>As far as the Orthodox are concerned, they are bunkered down in a tiny portion of what is rightfully theirs. As for how they defend what they have and get their rightful due, the God of the Old Testament who visited 12 plagues on the Egyptians including the slaying of the first-born, is beyond the jurisdiction of Amnesty International. How do you argue with this? You can't. To tell the Orthodox that God's covenant with the Jews, ritually re-enacted at the ceremonies of circumcision and Bar Mitzvah is a fairy story, a myth, is to deprive people who have spent their entire lives locked up in yeshivas, studying the Torah and the Talmud, not just of their beliefs but of their very selves. Without God they are naked and shivering in the world. All you can do is marginalise them out of harm's way, as Barak did when he put together his first coalition. </p> <p>On the first three of my visits to Israel, which were before the 1999 elections, the Orthodox were what everyone wanted to talk about. The religious right had assumed too much power and were interfering in the everyday lives of secular and moderately religious Israelis, preventing them from shopping or taking public transport on Shabbat. The Orthodox were driving people nuts. They were Netanyahu's coalition allies in blocking the peace process and in opinion poll after opinion poll around 70% of the population repeatedly said that they believed there would be a Palestinian state. They didn't necessarily say they supported it, but they agreed on its inevitability. </p> <p>The majority of Israelis have arrived at an uneasy acceptance of the proximity of yet another country full of people they regard as their enemies. This has happened partly because they have been worn down by the intifada, partly because of the success of the long campaign by the Israeli Left in convincing them that they can \"trust the Arabs\" as they put it. And here, I came to think, was the heart of the Israeli mentality. Ordinary Israelis are sick of wars, they are sick of sending their teenage sons to the army, but they are deeply insecure about whether they can risk peace. It isn't the memory of the Holocaust that drives them; it is the memory of over 50 years of Arab nations telling them that they will \"drive the Jews into the sea\". The Israeli terror is that in delivering the justice to the Palestinians that the world demands, they may be signing their own death warrants. \"They call us colonialists,\" a man said to me, \"but if we lose, where do I go? Back to Yemen where my grandfather came from in the 1930s?\" Like fairground distorting mirrors, the world looks at the Israelis and sees a giant, a monster, but the Israeli looks and sees a tiny, cowering figure, the puny kid walking to school, tormented by bullies. He needs a Charles Atlas course. He needs to make himself stronger, not weaker. </p> <p>When the cameras report from Gaza and we see a boy, not unlike a boy we have ourselves at home perhaps, but with a stone in his hands, we are looking at an angry child. That's not what the Israelis see. The boy is a hazy presence, ill-defined. They are peering past him to glimpse the shadowy figures in the windows of the apartment building, the Tanzim, the armed civilian militias and beyond them Hamas, who are the Islamic version of the Orthodox, locked into their rejection of Israel's right to exist. And beyond Hamas is the figure of Sadaam Hussein surrounded by the four million Iraqis who have, in the past few weeks, volunteered to sign up to destroy Israel. </p> <p>When I listened to Israelis on my visits what struck me was how very little they thought about or even mentioned the Palestinians, and this seems to have been true from the earliest days of Zionism. Asking old people, both left and right, what they thought the resident Arab population would make of the longing for a Jewish homeland, they answered, on the whole, \"We didn't think about them at all.\" They were too intent on their war with the British. In his book The Yellow Wind, the Israeli novelist David Grossman, an opponent of Occupation, describes a journey in the occupied territories in the 1980s in which he talked to Palestinians and settlers. Grossman summed up in the mindset of a settler what I think remains today the Israeli refusal to engage with the Palestinians' anguish: \"He does not want to think even for a minute about the situation of the Arabs around him, because he is caught up in a struggle with them, at war, he said, and were he to allow himself to pity, to identify, he would weaken and endanger himself.\" </p> <p>The \"tough Jew\" is not a new phenomenon, it only has a new setting. In another book Tough Jews: Fathers, Sons and Gangster Dreams, the author, Rich Cohen, writes of the world of the American Jewish gangsters in the 1920s and 1930s and what they meant to his father and to his father's best friend, Larry King, growing up as Jewish kids in Brooklyn, listening every day on the radio to bad news from Europe. He asked why his father's generation began to even deny that the gangsters - Arnold Rothstein, Meyer Lansky, Dutch Schultz - had ever existed. The answer, Cohen thought, was that the Jews have always needed iconic tough guys and have always had them, but after 1948 they had the Israeli army, fighters who were legit, who didn't have to break the law. Andrea Dworkin, in her recently published book Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation, describes how the ideal of the Jewish man - bookish, gentle, family-loving - was banished in shame after the Holocaust. They turned themselves into cartoon alpha males. A Jewish boy in a soup kitchen in Jaffa, when I asked him what a Jew was, raised a pimple-sized bicep and said: \"Strong\". </p> <p>So if the Israelis have turned themselves into tough guys, how do they see the Palestinians? If the Arabs - in particular Hezbollah and Syria - are a military threat then the Palestinians are merely an irritant. The ugly truth, I think, is that what they feel for the Palestinians is contempt, that they are losers, and this instinct is built into the founding ideals of the first Zionists. In a refugee camp, David Grossman asks a woman who has lived for 40 years in the same United Nation refugee house if she would be happy if she was given \"a dunam . . . of land in a nice place, with light in the open air. 'Yes, yes - she laughs - of course, but only on my own land'\". Then Grossman remembers, \"how many times Palestinian leaders missed opportunities to gain themselves a homeland: there was the partition proposal of 1936 and the second proposal of 1947, and maybe there were other chances. They - in their blindness - rejected them all\". </p> <p>Deep in the Jewish psyche is the legacy of cutting your losses, moving on, reinventing yourself in order to survive. Deep in the Arab psyche is the attachment to the land, to patience and endurance. A boy tells Grossman of \"his\" house in Jaffa. He has never seen it but his grandfather did. What is Jaffa like, Grossman asks? A place of orchards, the boy replies. Actually it is part of the conurbation Tel Aviv-Yaffo, near the business district, circled with motorways. Why, the Israelis ask, perplexed, can't the Palestinians get over the loss of their homeland, why can't they live for the future instead of the past, like the Jews did? If the Jews have been such a roaring success in 20th-century America it has been, in part, because they left Eastern Europe, which had, after all been their home for centuries and never once looked back. </p> <p>And when they ask themselves this question - why can't the Palestinians be like us? - the only answer they can think of is that the Palestinians are losers. Whatever their strategy it always fails. Invited by the UN in 1947 to form a country, the Jews seized the chance, and declared independence. The Palestinians rejected the opportunity to form theirs and sat back waiting for the Arab armies to defeat the new state. They attacked and lost and the result was that the Palestinians were driven out or fled, washing up in camps where they remain today. When the two sides in the cold war picked their teams, Israel got the US and the Palestinians and the Arabs got the Soviet Union. The latter no longer exists to back them. In the Gulf War the Palestinians supported Sadaam Hussein, currently the world's pariah leader. Some Palestinians have enthusiastically embraced Holocaust denial, their hero the \"distinguished historian\" David Irving. And all this time the Israelis, backed by the only remaining superpower, forged into the new hi-tech age, positioned themselves for globalisation. </p> <p>In their own minds the Jews are better than the Arabs, and this goes further back than the consequences of the grim conditions imposed on the Palestinians by the occupation or the restriction on the civil liberties of the Arab Israelis. The earliest Zionists, coming from Russia after the failure of the 1905 revolution, saw themselves as bringing ideas of soviet socialism to the benighted peoples of the Middle East. Later, when the Yekkes, the Jews from Germany reluctantly arrived, torn away kicking and screaming from the cafes of Berlin, they saw themselves as the Weimar Republic in exile, bringing socialism, feminism, psychoanalysis and cubism to a land slumbering in the Middle Ages. It was another form of colonialism, of course, but a cultural one. </p> <p> How do the mentalities of nations change? Not quickly. Here in Britain we are still dealing with the vestiges of the anger that many feel because we are no longer an empire. It took the Germans until the 1960s, 25 years after total military defeat, before a new generation even began to throw a searchlight on the activities of their own parents. In Austria, it is argued, this process hasn't even begun. What will it take to make the Israelis see the Palestinians as a wronged people in pursuit of justice, the victims of Jewish racism? Not yet another photo of a murdered child, nor even a whole album, but only peace itself will do it, which is why the Israeli left felt so badly let down by the new intifada. Instinctively, they knew that the mass of Israelis can only begin to respect the Palestinians when the threat from them is not to their borders but to their computer industry. </p> <p>\u0095 When I Lived in Modern Times, is published by Granta.

  "Labour MPs last night defied pressure from senior ministers when they voted to elect Michael Martin, a former shop steward from Labour's industrial heartlands, to become 152nd Speaker of the House of Commons - instead of the Old Etonian Tory ex-cabinet minister, Sir George Young. <p>After the father of the Commons, 84-year-old Sir Edward Heath, had rejected pleas for a straightforward ballot to choose from the 12 contenders, it took more than six hours of cumbersome voting to complete the election as even no-hopers took their turn - to the dismay of Westminster modernisers. </p> <p>By the time it was over the once crowded chamber was almost deserted. Mr Martin was never fewer than 76 votes ahead of his 11 rivals and in no serious danger of defeat. </p> <p>With the help of the ministerial \"payroll vote\" Sir George got closest, losing by 317 to 241. Labour's strongest challenger, the sacked cabinet minister David Clark, managed only 192 votes to the winner's 257. Menzies Campbell in the Lib Dem corner lost 403-89. </p> <p>With Tony Blair not voting in person, but privately keen not to be seen to insist on a Labour Speaker, at least 25 ministers, including David Blunkett, Margaret Beckett, Jack Straw and Peter Mandelson, backed Sir George. But the move backfired as angry backbenchers protested at the tactic when the parliamentary Labour party met on the Commons' first day back since July 27. What they saw as inadvertent control freakery may cost another of yesterday's Young-backers, Clive Soley, his job as PLP chairman next month. </p> <p>In picking the 55-year-old MP for Glasgow Springburn as successor to Betty Boothroyd, Labour backbenchers sent a complex series of messages to the government and the wider, watching electorate months before the general election. </p> <p>He is the first Speaker to be an authentic representative of the industrial working class, the child of an impoverished broken home who met his wife in a factory. \"My origin should be no reason for me being elected, nor should my origin be a reason to debar me,\" Mr Martin told MPs yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Martin will be the first Roman Catholic Speaker since Henry VIII's Protestant Reformation, a symbol of old barriers falling as British political culture evolves. As an anti-devolution Scot he may also prove a symbol of the enduring union between England and Scotland. </p> <p>After the traditional dragging of the new Speaker to the chair - a relic of times when it was a high-risk office - Mr Martin last night promised to uphold the rights and duties of the Commons, not least in resisting a government whose huge majority allows it to bypass the House. \"Michael will be tough,\" one close ally predicted. </p> <p>Yesterday's contest was conducted in fierce but fair-minded terms after Sir Edward had resisted calls from senior MPs on both sides, led by Tony Benn, to use his brief afternoon of power to tear up rules not devised for a multi-candidate contest. He expressed \"considerable sympathy\" and offered his own version of a compromise. </p> <p>That was to set out the order in which he intended to call the 12 contenders, who would be voted on two at a time. Unexpectedly he started with the bookies' favourite, Mr Martin. Equally unexpectedly he let the contest run to the bitter end. </p> <p>By general consent Gwyneth Dunwoody made the most impassioned speech and Sir George the most elegant. But Mr Martin did what ex-shop stewards do: won the vote by planning and hard graft. </p> <p>Each rival's name was added as an amendment to the motion: </p> <p><b> Sir Alan Haselhurst (Con)</b> lost by 140 to 345 </p> <p><b> Alan Beith (Lib Dem)</b> 83 to 409 </p> <p><b> Gwyneth Dunwoody (Lab)</b> 170 to 341 </p> <p><b> Sir George Young (Con)</b> 241 to 317 </p> <p><b> Menzies Campbell (Lib Dem)</b> 98 to 381 </p> <p><b> David Clark (Lab)</b> 192 to 257 </p> <p><b> Nicholas Winterton (Con)</b> 116 to 340 </p> <p><b> John McWilliam (Lab)</b> 30 to 309 </p> <p><b> Michael Lord (Con)</b> 146 to 290 </p> <p><b> Sir Patrick Cormack (Con)</b> 130 to 287 </p> <p><b> Richard Shepherd (Con)</b> 136 to 282</p>",
  "<p>BSkyB could be banned from bidding for pay-per-view football rights amid fears that the Premier League could face legal action over the collapse of last week's deal with NTL.</p> <p>Lawyers at the Premier League are already poring over documents relating to the original auction and executives admit that they could face legal action if Sky is allowed re-enter the bidding. </p> <p>A spokesman confirmed that the Premier League was looking at possible legal complications resulting from a broadcaster owning more than one football rights package.</p> <p>He said: \"Our legal team is looking at two issues.

  "<b>What is the RIP Act?</b> <br> The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act sets out the government's plans for how the security services can monitor and access communication over the internet. It passed into law hours before the Commons rose for its summer break and has now come into force. <p><b>Why is it so controversial?</b><br> Critics say the act is a gross invasion of privacy which will scupper e-commerce in Britain; the government argues it is necessary to crack down on internet crime and paedophilia. </p> <p><b>What are the key areas of controversy?</b> The first is <b>\"black box\" interception</b>. Security services, such as MI5, will be able to monitor people's internet habits through the collection of \"communications data\". This data is not website or email content, but users' \"clickstream\" - the websites and chatrooms they visit and the addresses of emails they send and receive. If security services suspect criminal activity, they request a government warrant to intercept and decode internet content. </p> <p>The Home Office says the interception procedures are in line with the right to privacy enshrined in article eight of the <a href=\"http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/5e.htm\" target=\"_new\">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR - now part of UK law) and simply brings the monitoring of the internet in line with that of telephone calls. All telephone numbers are logged (call content is not) and some telephone companies are required to enable security services to intercept calls. But web addresses also show exactly what people have been looking at and build up detailed profiles of where people go online and who they communicate with.</p> <p>Under RIP, some UK internet service providers (ISPs) will be asked \"to maintain a reasonable intercept capability\". This will come in the form of the much hyped \"black boxes\", a piece of computer technology enabling the security services to monitor the flow of data. Critics say that the black boxes will be hugely expensive and will have <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,333564,00.html\">difficulty keeping pace</a> with fast-changing internet technology as well as the ever-growing volume of internet traffic. </p> <p>The Home Office claims the power of interception is rarely used. All security service warrants for the interception of data will require the personal approval of the home secretary and must meet stringent criteria - national security must be threatened or serious crime must be suspected. Critics prefer an independent judicial panel, which would provide external checks on the system and ensure spies and governments maintain the rule of law. </p> <p>The second key controversy is the legislation's <b>reverse burden of proof</b>. If intercepted communications are encrypted (encoded and made secret), the act will force the individual to surrender the keys (pin numbers which allow users to decipher encoded data), on pain of jail sentences of up to two years. The government says keys will only be required in special circumstances and promises that the security services will destroy the keys as soon as they are finished with.</p> <p>Human rights campaigners argue the act reverses the burden of proof in UK law. There is also the threat of stiff prison sentences if an individual who has been required to hand over keys tells a third party. However, the Home Office says the burden remains on the prosecution to prove \"beyond reasonable doubt that an accused person is, or has been, in possession of a key to unlock particular protected data.\" The act also contains a defence for individuals who have lost or forgotten a key, and a person is no longer liable if they are judged to have done all they can to help the authorities to recover a key.</p> <p>Critics argue that innocent people could still be jailed for innocently forgetting keys, while drug smugglers and paedophiles would happily settle for a two-year prison sentence rather than face far harsher penalties for being found guilty of the crime they are suspected of.</p> <p><b>What about employers?</b><br> The act also allows employers to intercept emails and internet use by their staff, on grounds such as monitoring for computer viruses. </p> <p><b>Will the act compromise e-commerce?</b><br> Many in business fear the act will scare off e-commerce entrepreneurs. A fiercely critical British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) report estimates the RIP Act could cost business \u00a346bn in the first five years of operation, as ISPs are compelled to install costly black boxes, e-commerce firms are forced out of the country and new firms are dissuaded from basing their operations in the UK.</p> <p>The act's potential to enable unlimited \"fishing expeditions\" in companies' databases compromises corporate privacy, they argue, while security service knowledge of clickstreams and encryption keys could fall into criminal hands, compromising the security of e-commerce. Forcing employees to secretly hand over encryption keys could also breach trust and rules within a company. </p> <p>In turn, the home secretary, <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/oicd/ftletter.htm\" target=\"_new\">Jack Straw</a>, says the BCC's figures are \"incredible\" given that the value of UK e-commerce is currently estimated at around \u00a35bn. He prefers to highlight what he says is the overall cost of crime - \u00a350bn a year.</p> <p><b>What do other countries do?</b><br> There is no comparable legislation in the US. Tim Berners-Lee, the British inventor of the world wide web, has said that RIP would have been thrown out of the US \"in a second\". Ireland recently sought to encourage e-commerce by passing a law making it illegal for government to access commercial encryption keys. France has relaxed controls on domestic encryption, while Germany is opposed to restrictions on citizens' use of encryption. Russia, Singapore and Malaysia have passed laws similar to RIP.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldbills/061/2000061.htm\" target=\"_new\">The RIP bill</a><br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/oicd/ripbill.htm\" target=\"_new\">The Home Office RIP site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/newsandpolicy/ict/index.html\" target=\"_new\">The British Chambers of Commerce information and communication technology page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2000/rp00-025.pdf\" target=\"_new\">House of Commons library research report (pdf)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm\" target=\"_new\">The Human Rights Act 1998 (enshrines the ECHR into British law)</a></p>",
  "<p>Senior US diplomats have praised the efforts of Tony Blair's government to capture the drive and productivity of Britain's emerging technology and internet sectors and help them turn the domestic economy into Europe's top performer, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. </p> <p>In private dispatches to Washington this year, officials at the US Embassy in London have reported that US firms \"have taken notice of how the one-time 'sick man of Europe' is now the economic leader\" on the continent\". </p> <p>They added that Britain's hi-tech entrepreneurs have cast off the old \"British reserve\" and are now imbued with a new \"can-do\" spirit. </p> <p>A campaign to increase trade between US and British firms should \"go a long way to fulfilling the needs of our new generation of exporters,\" the Americans wrote. </p> <p>The officials wrote in June: \"As New Labour enters its fourth year in power, the government is taking action to build on the macro-economic success it enjoys in having created the strongest UK economy in more than two decades. </p> <p>\"By introducing new policies and legislation to foster entrepreneurs and the emerging technologies needed to transform the economy, the government intends to increase productivity, and hence UK global competitiveness, far into the 21st century.\" </p> <p>In March, the officials had told colleagues in Washington: \"The prime minister and the New Labour government have set out to make the UK the economic engine of the EU, with e-commerce and emerging technologies the means to achieve this goal.\" </p> <p>The reports underline how the embassy has been working closely with the \"highest levels\" of the Blair government to encourage American firms to invest in Britain. Ambassador Philip Lader has met chancellor Gordon Brown and trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers several times. </p> <p>In the spring, a team of embassy officials were tasked to investigate \"Britain's second industrial revolution, the change to an information-based economy\". </p> <p>The diplomats reported: \"The team criss-crossed 'Silicon Fen', the area surrounding Cambridge, to meet the inventors, entrepreneurs, academics, venture capitalists and officials that have turned this area into Europe's leading area of innovation.\" </p> <p>They added that a \"rapidly increasing number\" of American IT and internet companies were seeking business partners in this \"hotbed of cutting-edge technology companies\". </p> <p>The embassy reports were disclosed to the Guardian under the US freedom of information act. </p> <p>They show that the Americans were pleased with a conference which they organised in March this year on new technologies. </p> <p>\"One event, a panel discussion by local 'start-up' business leaders most of whom are now billionaires, epitomised the switch from the old 'British reserve' to the new 'can-do' approach of UK industry - with US technology and partners.\" </p> <p>Despite the diplomatic backslapping, many industry executives are concerned with the latest corporate developments in Britain. Smaller start-ups say provisions for share options in their profit and loss accounts - recommended by the Accounting Standards Board - could cost the industry billions. </p> <p>The government's controversial regulation of investigatory powers (Rip) bill, which relates to computer communications, was deemed so draconian that companies such as Nokia and Yahoo! warned they might move from British shores. </p> <p>The chief executive of one UK internet success story said: \"What the government has got to stop doing is treating the internet as a photo opportunity and more as a serious commercial prospect.\" </p> <p><strong>Live wire ideas</strong></p> <p>Tony Blair pledged to put electronic business at the heart of the British economy. Initiatives included: </p> <p>\u0095Appointment of <strong> Patricia Hewitt</strong> as e-commerce minister. </p> <p>\u0095Working with <strong> Oftel</strong> to foster competition in telecoms markets and drive down the cost of net access. </p> <p>\u0095A 100% first year capital allowances for IT investment by <strong>small businesses</strong> . </p> <p>\u0095Getting <strong> schools</strong> online and fostering students' IT skills. </p> <p>\u0095A national network of<strong> online business advisers</strong>, helping firms go online. </p> <p>\u0095The <strong> Electronic Communications Act</strong> provided for electronic signatures to be admissible as evidence in legal proceedings.</p>",
  "A n independent international report was handed to Kofi Annan, secretary general of the UN, yesterday. The Kosovo Report advocates \"conditional independence\" for Kosovo. Recent events in Belgrade underline the importance of this conclusion. <p>The revolution which overthrew Slobodan Milosevic was a genuine people's revolution. The miners and men from Cacak with their bulldozers and tractors stormed the parliament and the TV station. It marks a decisive break with the past 10 years.The new regime is likely to adopt a peaceful, more legalistic, approach towards solving the conflicts of the region. </p> <p>But Milosevic's fall was not celebrated in Sarajevo, Pristina or Podgorica. So many tragedies have happened - no one can bring back the dead or reverse the trauma of ethnic cleansing. And the Serbia that has been revealed by liberation is a Serbia brutalised by 10 years of isolation and propaganda. Those who voted for Vojislav Kostunica did not do so because they opposed the atrocities but because of the collapse of the economy and the failure of hopes for a Greater Serbia. Those who marched on Belgrade carried Serbian flags and wore the symbols of Serbian nationalism. </p> <p>Nato intervention and the sanctions precipitated economic collapse, but they also diverted attention from what the Serbs were doing to their neighbours. Kostunica is a democrat but also a nationalist. He opposed the Nato bombing and the Hague war crimes trials. On Sunday, he visited Trebinje in Republika Srpska to pay respects at the grave of a Serbian poet, although he also visited Sarajevo. </p> <p>It is often argued that the best strategy for Kosovo is \"constructive ambiguity\". It is more important to normalise everyday life and to defer status questions for later. A period of ambiguity would give President Kostunica time to consolidate his position. But the ambiguity about Kosovo's status, as enshrined in UN Security Council Resolution 1244, which allows self-governing status for Kosovo while Yugoslavia retains sovereignty over it, is far from \"constructive\". It is very difficult to normalise everyday life when Kosovo has no constitution or basic law which could guide decisions on a whole range of issues including security, currency and even planning regulations. </p> <p>This is one reason why it is taking so long to establish an effective administration or provide security within Kosovo and this, in turn, nurtures criminalisation. Minority Serbs are living in armed enclaves among the majority Albanians, there is growing frustration about their exclusion from governance. This week there are local elections in Kosovo and next year there will be national elections. All Albanian parties are united by the demand for independence. If this continues to be thwarted, frustration is likely to grow. </p> <p> </p> <p> T here will also be elections for the Serbian parliament in December; it will be impossible to prevent Kosovan Serbs from participating since they voted in the Yugoslav elections in September. Without clarity about status, it is difficult to see how their situation can be ameliorated. The Serbs will continue to see themselves as part of Serbia with no necessity to accommodate towards the Kosovan Albanians, while many Albanians will continue to regard the Kosovan Serbs as a Belgrade fifth column. </p> <p>Risks arise from the nationalistic stance of the present government. Because this is a time of democratic transition, the Serbian position will be heard with much greater sympathy than before and the ambiguity of Kosovo's position could grow. Both Kostunica and Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the opposition alliance, have talked about bringing Serbia and Kosovo closer together and implementing Res olution 1244, including the paragraph about sending Yugoslav and Serbian troops to Kosovo. Albanian leaders fear that the argument for independence will seem less pressing since Milosevic is no longer in power. </p> <p>Opportunities arise from the democratic character of the new regime. Dialogue is all the more important to open up Serbia and to change the ingrained attitudes of the last decade. \"Conditional independence\" means self-government within an international framework, in which the international community retains responsibility for external security and the protection of minorities. Independence would be based on an \"internal agreement\" negotiated between the international community and the different peoples of Kosovo, and an \"external agreement\" with Kosovo's neighbours. There is a real possibility now to start those negotiations. </p> <p>Baton Haxhiu, editor of Koha Ditore, a moderate newspaper in Kosovo, says there can be no dialogue with Belgrade until the Serb government acknowledges its responsibility for the genocide. But Kosovan Albanians also need to acknowledge their ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo. If there were a serious prospect of \"conditional independence\", it might provide the incentive for Kosovan Albanians to initiate dialogue and, perhaps, to participate in the December elections on a platform of independence. </p> <p> Mary Kaldor is a member of the International Independent Commission to Investigate the Kosovo Crisis.

  "Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, would rather save his own skin than pursue the \"peace of the brave\" to which he committed himself after his election last year. That is the distasteful conclusion that must be drawn from his decision to invite the hawkish Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, to join a national emergency government. Mr Barak appears to have little choice but to seek new parliamentary allies. Without them, his minority coalition is unlikely to survive for long once the Knesset reconvenes next week. Although his One Israel negotiators are also talking to Meretz, Shas, and other, smaller parties, it is the Likud's votes that would most surely guarantee Mr Barak's survival. But the price is too high - and there is another, more honest way. <p>It is true that Mr Barak has been unfortunate in his peace interlocutors, both in Syria and in Lebanon. In Yasser Arafat, Mr Barak has been confronted by a man lacking the courage to lead, who would rather sacrifice Palestine's children than make the difficult choices that peace requires. It is clear that Mr Arafat had no intention of honouring last week's Sharm el-Sheikh ceasefire, preferring to play the liberation hero to the fickle Arab gallery. His renewed talk of declaring an independent state seems like a cruel fantasy, given that it would lack land, funds, a viable economy and recognition - another of his vainglorious duplicities, except this time the dupes are his own people. Nor, during the present crisis, has Mr Barak been well served by a clumsily brutal, badly trained Israeli army that far too often has answered stones with live rounds. Mr Barak has not just lost his majority; he has lost the propaganda war, too. But the answer is not to give up on peace. There is an alternative. </p> <p>The terms under which Mr Sharon may agree to join forces with Mr Barak are unacceptably destructive. As deputy prime minister (and possibly finance minister, too), he would want a veto on all diplomatic and security-related decisions. He would insist that negotiating positions adopted at Camp David, especially on Jerusalem and land transfers, be withdrawn. He would oppose any evacuation of Jewish settlements. And he would accept only an interim future accord confining the Palestinians to the 42% of the West Bank over which they currently exercise full or partial control. </p> <p>Such a regression would convince Arabs that Israel did not want peace at all. It would undermine Egypt's and Jordan's leaders, invigorate extremists, and further alienate Israel's Arab community. And it would encourage the escapist talk within Israel of permanent separation - that is to say, the fencing off, literally, of the Palestinian and Jewish nations from each other; the setting in stone of historic injustice and the institutionalisation of fear and hate. This is another cruel, impracticable fantasy for two peoples who must learn to live together, or suffer alone. Yet there is another way. </p> <p>Rather than duck, Mr Barak should stand and fight. Rather than cut shabby deals, he should tell Mr Sharon and the likes of Binyamin Netanyahu to get lost. If Knesset support cannot be found elsewhere, he should himself call a general election. And then he should force the public to confront the central question it has dodged since 1967: is Israel at last prepared to pay the high price of peace? If not, does it fully comprehend the awful consequences? Given the current mood, it is a gamble Mr Barak might easily lose. But somebody must show leadership and vision, must make the momentous choice clear - and it will not be Mr Arafat or rightwing Israeli has-beens. Peace or no peace? Let the people decide. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "To say Iain Hay Gordon looks haunted is an understatement. But this week, almost half a century after the sensational events which were to shatter his life, the cadaverous 68-year-old Glaswegian is at last set to be cleared of one of the most notorious murders in Northern Ireland. <p>The court of appeal in Belfast will today begin to hear his application to have his conviction overturned for the murder of a high court judge's only daughter in November 1952. Sources close to the director of public prosecutions indicate there will be no attempt to sustain the verdict of guilty but insane. </p> <p>The stabbing of Patricia Curran, 19, whose father, Lancelot Curran, was a former attorney general and Ulster Unionist MP at Stormont, gripped Northern Ireland. Even now, the case is spawning a minor industry in books and screenplays. </p> <p>With Gordon set to be cleared, speculation will turn to who really killed Miss Curran at the Glen, the family's sumptuous house at Whiteabbey, eight miles north of Belfast. Long-time residents of the village believe Doris Cur ran, the victim's late mother, is the leading suspect. </p> <p>Gordon was reluctant to be pulled into that controversy as he focused on the start of a hearing scheduled to last three days. He is staying at a hotel close to the site of the Glen, where several houses have been built since the Currans' house was demolished several years ago. He said: \"I never gave up, and I feel delighted now to be on the point of vindication after all these years.\" </p> <p>His solicitor, Margot Harvey, said his team had eight points which would each demolish the crown's case at the trial in March 1953. The crown is expected to concede that the confession, the only evidence against Gordon, was fabricated, and that the evidence of one witness, which represented a strong alibi, was not disclosed to his defence team. </p> <p>Gordon was 20 and on national service with the RAF at the nearby Edenmore base at the time of the killing. Many colleagues regarded him as a misfit, but he knew Desmond Curran, the victim's brother, the only other character in the drama still alive, through a shared interest in religion. </p> <p>Mr Curran, then a barrister, was later to turn his back on the law and on his Presbyter ian upbringing. He is a Catholic priest in South Africa, and says he still believes Gordon was guilty. </p> <p>Gordon was arrested in January 1953 after Scotland Yard detectives were called in to aid the RUC, under pressure because of the prominence of the victim's father, who was later knighted. Gordon confessed after three days of intense interrogation, when he was told his mother would be told of a homosexual encounter unless he admitted murder. His lawyers, apparently denied evidence which could have cleared him, embarked on the one tactic they felt would save him from the rope. They produced evidence which led him to be found guilty but insane. </p> <p>He was sent to Holywell mental hospital in Antrim, and spent two years in a closed ward. He was freed after seven years, on the proviso he returned to Glasgow, changed his name and never talked about the case. Only after he retired early as a warehouseman in 1993 did he begin his fight to be cleared. </p> <p>From the beginning the evidence never added up. Judge Curran and his son found the body at 2am and quickly moved it to a doctor's home nearby, suggesting to an overawed policeman she was still alive even though her arm was stiff with rigor mortis. The doctor at first suggested she had been shot. She had instead been stabbed 37 times. But there was little blood at the scene, suggesting she had died elsewhere and her body dumped. </p> <p>A pile of her belongings were 10 yards from the body, dry despite the rain, and placed rather than dropped in the scuffle which police had claimed had occurred. Her wristwatch was broken, as if to suggest a fight. But neither the missing hands nor any broken glass were found near the scene.</p>",

A tannery has polluted the drinking water of a nearby town causing children to die of leukemia. The parents have tried for years to get someone to admit responsibility. This is really their story but they are marginalised with Travolta cast as a hot-shot, lawyer who lost everything trying this case. He's brash, cocky, plays by his own rules. In other words he's a Travolta type and no one plays this better than Travolta. Too much of a \"movie\" to move you. </p> <p><strong> Arlington Road</strong> </p> <p>(Mark Pellington, 1998) </p> <p>10pm, Sky Premier </p> <p>Politics lecturer Jeff Bridges has his doubts about new neighbours Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack. But Bridges is himself a loose cannon, grieving for his FBI-agent wife who was killed in a raid, and preaching a radical agenda at college; so is he paranoid, or are the couple across the street terrorists? Pellington keeps us guessing, and although the climax is a tad obvious, this is anintriguing thriller. </p> <p><strong> Pi</strong> </p> <p>(Darren Aronofsky, 1997) </p> <p>10pm, FilmFour </p> <p>In a strangely disturbing, black-and-white version of reality, Sean Gullette's wacky Max sits in his Chinatown apartment trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe - in the form of the mathematical formula that, he believes, governs the stock market.

The twisty plot, taken from a Ruth Rendell story, concerns young Victor (Javier Bardem), imprisoned for the accidental shooting of a policeman: when released, Victor finds the girl he loves married to the now paraplegic cop. The mature Almod\u00f3var has toned down the frenetic heat of his comedies. This is an intimate picture of passion, jealousy and revenge, the characters dignified by real emotion and motivation; and all this allied to the old Pedro's vibrant visual style.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Life of the mind...</strong> A welcome breeze of high culture this week, as peerlessly erudite novelist and raconteur Gore Vidal flits over from his sun-dappled Italian villa to promote his latest novel The Golden Age (the seventh in his series of American historical epics). In fact, the old boy may well already be in town by the time you read this, what with his appointment to give a lecture at The Royal Geographic Society this evening (billed as Europe And The US: A Small Subject), before signing copies of his opus at Hatchards, Piccadilly on Wednesday night. </p> <p><strong> Notes and queries...</strong> Meanwhile, amid the hullabaloo over Cameron Crowe's forthcoming big-screen rock-hack memoir Almost Famous, there could hardly be a better time to greet the arrival of Greil Marcus, world's greatest rock critic and, in his own, professorial way, a man almost as dapper as Gore Vidal. Pitching up next Monday, Marcus is over plugging his new book (there's a lot of it about) Double Trouble: Bill Clinton And Elvis Presley In A Land Of No Alternatives, and then sticks around until Bonfire Night. </p> <p><strong> The devil has all the best tunes... </strong> Which is by way of explaining that German veterans Faust, among the more impressively demented collectives of the Krautrock era, are over to deliver a live soundtrack to FW Murnau's silent classic, Nosferatu, at the Royal Festival Hall tomorrow night. And, like, that's a really weird coincidence when you bear in mind that, after directing his vampire effort, Murnau later made a still massively influential version of ... Faust. See? Isn't that, like, totally weird? </p> <p><strong> They come from a land down under...</strong> Which just leaves time to point out that fey Australian guitar band The Go-Betweens are due over in support of their latest album Friends Of Rachel Worth, playing (perhaps predictably) the Shepherd's Bush Empire on Wednesday night.</p>",
  "\u0095 We are delighted to introduce readers to a New Labour chameleon to put even Mr Tony Blair, the lovable leprechaun of political craic, to shame. He is would-be MP Shahid Malik, and his ubiquity is matched only by his imagination. When seeking selection in Preston (he's also tried Brent East, Tottenham, Leeds Central and others), he wrote: \"Although I was brought up in Burnley, I spent much of my teenage years playing snooker at Preston's Royal Snooker Suite.\" Aha. He announces himself as the first black or Asian person to win election to Labour's NEC constituencies section (news to Diane Abbott), and boasts of \"a role in two of our country's defining moments - the Good Friday Agreement and the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.\" And in a glossy leaflet packed with Michael Winner-style poses with Gerry Adams, Mo Mowlam, Baldrick and others, this intriguing Zelig figure reveals: \"I was born in a mining hospital in Burnley\". A what? What a character. Will someone please find him a seat forthwith? <p>\u0095 BBC1's unbearably exciting breakfast show reveals sound editorial judgment. Yesterday Gore Vidal was on, talking about the American election, and they gave him about 90 seconds before interrupting him mid-sentence in favour of bus timetable news or something equally diverting. Brilliant. Although this column had a spat with Gore a while back (I recall a fax referring to someone as \"Nellie Norman\"), we love this wittiest and most splendid of men to bits. Ah, but if only he hadn't been riven by self-doubt, who knows what he might not have made of himself. </p> <p>\u0095 Many will share the regret of Fatty \"Nicholas\" Soames, Kenneth Roy and others at the lack of deference in modern society. So well done Harrow council, for deciding to gift Harrow public school its own road! Harrow already owns part of Grove Hill, but the council wants to extend this right up to the school gates - and at no cost to the \u00a315,000 per annum school. Harrow claims this is essential for safety reasons, but locals, furious at the council's sycophancy, insist usual calming measures (humps, that sort of thing) would be fine. These people should know their place. Even if they can't bring themselves to line up on Grove Hill on the first day of term and do a bit of hat-doffing, the least the silly arses can do is hold their peasant tongues. </p> <p>\u0095 Thanks to all the readers who have suggested possible cast members for Carry On Up the Cabinet. Our email postbag is bulging, if digital messages can be said to bulge. I'm especially intrigued by the high number of nominations for Hattie Jacques to play the role of weirdo chancellor Gordon Brown. We are likely to stretch this subject out over the months to come, so keep the ideas coming. </p> <p>\u0095 A mayday call has been picked up from the world of high art. The performers behind the acclaimed interpretative show Puppetry of the Penis, running at the Whitehall Theatre in London, have run into a problem. Their insurers are insisting that they take on an understudy as soon as possible. \"Obviously they would need to have a talent for genital origami and an excellent stretch factor,\" says Katherine Camps, a spokesperson for the show. They'd also need an Australian or similar accent. The potential understudies will be called to a closed audition, and may be asked to perform some of the more complex installations, such as \"The Pelican\". Anyone interested should get in touch with the Diary. No photographs, please. </p> <p>\u0095 On the subject of Australian high art, today sees the opening of the magnificent new exhibition by Roger Law of Spitting Image fame at the Rebecca Hossack Gallery (35 Windmill Street, W1). The show's open until November 25, but queues are probably already forming around the block. (Can we please keep the Gerald Kaufman puppet now, Roger?) </p>",
  "<p>Geo Interactive, the Israeli company whose products permit video-quality images and sound to be transmitted to mobile phones and computers, yesterday dismissed as \"pathetic\" a former investor's claim that it was entitled to a 50% share-holding in the firm. </p> <p>\"This claim has no legal merits, it is totally baseless, legally wrong and is totally composed of false statements,\" a statement from Geo said of the claim from the Jerusalem-based software house Malam Systems.</p> <p>\"The sole purpose of their claim is a pathetic and opportunistic attempt to extort Geo into a cash settlement via massive public pressure.\"</p> <p>Geo's stinging indictment was issued after reports of the pending legal action from Malam had knocked its share price back 12%.</p> <p>The statement appeared to calm investors fears and the shares rallied in afternoon, closing down just 5% at \u00a310.10p.</p> <p>The background to the claim is complex but relates to an investment that Malam made in Geo in the mid-90s which was later declared null and void. The investment was made when Geo was just a tiny company and Malam says that it was misled into nullifying its investment.</p> <p>Malam now wants to return to Geo the 1.6m Israeli shekels (\u00a3270,000) that it originally invested and claim 50.1% of the company.

  "Marjorie Evans, the headteacher cleared of slapping a boy across the face last month, will not be charged over separate claims of mistreating pupils, police said yesterday. <p>The fresh allegations of inappropriate emotional and physical handling of pupils at St Mary's junior school in Caldicot, Monmouthshire, were made last month after Mrs Evans, 56, successfully appealed against conviction and a three-month suspended prison sentence for common assault against the 10-year-old special needs pupil. </p> <p>Chief Inspector Nigel Russell of Gwent police said all information from the investigation would be forwarded to Monmouthshire county council for any action it, and the governors, considered appropriate. </p> <p>Mrs Evans has been suspended from her position since the first allegations were made in September 1999. </p> <p>School governors are to meet tomorrow to discuss whether disciplinary action will be taken against her or whether she will be reinstated. </p> <p>Mrs Evans said yesterday that she was relieved that the CPS had decided not to prosecute her but angry that proceedings had taken so long. </p> <p>\"I have lost a year of my life despite having done nothing wrong,\" she said. \"I was an ordinary headteacher, carrying out the same duties as thousands of other head teachers across the country. </p> <p>\"It distresses me to think that any one of the teaching profession could have false or malicious allegations made against them and have to suffer the same ordeal.\" </p> <p>Mrs Evans said she was waiting for the National Union of Teachers to discuss her return to work with the school and the local education authority. </p> <p>The crown prosecution service examined 33 witness statements, video evidence and records of interviews concerning the 10 allegations of assault and cruelty against 11 children at St Mary's. Police were told that there was no realistic prospect of conviction. </p> <p>Mrs Evans's supporters have claimed there has been a witch-hunt, but a CPS spokesman said that police had investigated her case \"without any preconceptions\". </p> <p>At last month's appeal hearing at Cardiff crown court, Mr Justice McKinnon, quashing her conviction following a trial before Abergavenny magistrates in July, said evidence against Mrs Evans was \"conflicting\" and \"unsatisfactory\". </p> <p>The special needs pupil had accused her of slapping him when he became difficult after being told that he could not go swimming with his classmates because of previous bad behaviour. </p> <p>Phil Cooke, director of life-long learning at Monmouthshire county council, said that the school governors had given \"no conditions and no time-frame\" for Mrs Evans's reinstatement when they suspended her last year. </p> <p>Dyfan Jones, a spokesman for the National Union of Teachers Cymru, said that Mrs Evans wanted to return to the school. \"I don't think she'd be able to return at the moment on health grounds. The stress has made her ill,\" he said. </p> <p>Two other teachers at the school who were investigated in connection with the allegations of mistreatment have also been cleared. </p> <p>Janet Bowen, one of the teachers, has been unable to return to work due to illness caused by the stress of the investigation. </p> <p>Gethin Lewis, secretary of NUT Cymru said: \"We had no doubts about Marj's innocence. We don't think the proper procedures for dealing with allegations against teachers were followed in this case. </p> <p>\"It's important to listen to the children but also to recognise that people who work in schools are vulnerable.\" </p> <p>Graham Powell, who lost his post as chairman of governors at St Mary's last month and has been a strong supporter of Mrs Evans throughout her suspension, called for the governors to reinstate her at the earliest opportunity. </p> <p>\"On what grounds can they not reinstate her? The law has decided she's innocent. Failure to do so is open to severe criticism,\" he said. </p> <p>Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT said: \"There are lessons to be learned from the way this matter has been conducted.\" He added that new guidelines on dealing with disruptive children will be distributed to union members this week.</p>",
  "In a Pentecostal church in Dallas, Al Gore took time out from discussing the Middle East and taxation to declare: \"The centre of my life is faith and family.\" <p>While the Democratic candidate was stressing to the congregation the importance of family values this weekend, television viewers saw a new Republican campaign ad featuring the nephew of his rival. </p> <p>\"I am a young Latino and I'm very proud of my bloodline,\" the 24-year-old law student said. \"I have an uncle that is running for president. His name? The same as mine - George Bush.\" </p> <p>With just two weeks until the election, George W Bush and Al Gore are brushing up their image as devoted family men. In sharp contrast to Britain, where a brush with family values in the 1990s put most politicians off for good, familial love has been put at the heart of this year's campaign in America. </p> <p>The dynastic quality of the campaign came to the fore at the party conventions this summer. Members of the Bush and Gore clans gave primetime platform speeches about the candidate as a husband, son, dad, while senior members of both parties were kept on the sidelines. </p> <p>\"Welcome to the next president of America and a fine dad,\" gushed Karenna Gore Schiff, Al's telegenic eldest daughter and the head of Gorenet, an outreach programme for young Democrats. </p> <p>The use of family members is not new in presidential politics. It is simply that this year's campaign has given them all more prominent roles. </p> <p>Marshall Whittman, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a non-partisan public policy thinktank, argues that this is both a reaction to the Clinton administration's scandals and the current state of the American psyche. \"America is economically prosperous but there is a fear that there is a values deficit,\" he said. \"Having a loving extended family is a way to inoculate yourself on values.\" </p> <p>The Gore campaign, in particular, has used the vice-president's family credentials both to humanise him and to distance him from Bill Clinton. It seemed to work in Los Angeles when Mr Gore's passionate kiss with his wife was credited with boosting his ratings. </p> <p>He regularly watches his only son play football on Saturdays, so much so that some of his aides fear that such time-consuming devotion could be costly as the campaign reaches its climax. </p> <p>It would have been hard for candidates from two well-known political dynasties to ignore their surnames. George and Al were named after presidential and senatorial fathers respectively. Several commentators argue that neither man would have been in the running had it not been for their family connection to politics. </p> <p>This adds a whiff of nepotism to the otherwise cheery picture of family life. To that end, Mr Bush Sr has played a relatively limited public role in his son's campaign. Pundits suggest that advisers got rid of him after he referred to a man standing for the US's highest elected office as \"the boy\" during the campaign's early days. </p> <p>Both candidates have been accused of the cynical packaging of family life. Tarek Milleron, who works as a driver and dogsbody for his uncle, the Green party candidate, Ralph Nader, is critical of Ms Schiff's platform performance in support of Mr Gore. \"She is obviously an intelligent person and there she is giving a speech she could have given when she was 14,\" he said. </p> <p>Others believe that this year's campaign is simply a feature of the Oprahfication of US politics, which started with America's best-known political family: the Kennedys.</p>",
  "<p>An impressive spat developed yesterday between Charter, the British engineering group, and Lincoln, the US welding specialist which has been threatening to complete a takeover for six months. </p> <p>Lincoln lapsed its \u00a3386m bid after the market had closed on Friday, provoking a furious statement over the weekend from Charter saying, in effect, that Lincoln had no right to pull out so soon. It added that negotiations over the sale had proved so tortuous that the underlying business had been affected. As a result, second-half operating profits from Charter would now be significantly below expectations. </p> <p>A new statement from Lincoln followed, insisting that the American company was fully entitled to lapse its offer, adding that Charter was made fully aware of its reasons for doing so - in advance. The market's response was swift and brutal. Faced with both a failed bid and a profits warning, the share price was chopped from 330p on Friday evening to 155p at the close of play yesterday. </p> <p>After a couple more statements from each party, the information flow came to a screaming halt, with both sides deep in discussion with their lawyers. The outcome of any legal action may be of interest because the row would seem to turn on whether Charter can somehow claim breach of contract over an as-yet non-statutory rule book - the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers. </p> <p>Working on this basis the Code, as it is known, has served the City well for many years. The European commission wants to put it on a legal footing and standardise rules across Europe. A move in this direction looks inevitable and so the Charter-Lincoln scrap gives us a little taste of the future - thick with lawyers. </p> <p>But there are other immediate aspects of this non-bid which might require certain participants in the London market to consult their defence attorneys. Lincoln's advisers seem to have told their counterparts at Charter that the whole thing was off around Friday lunchtime. Thereafter, Charter's shares began to fall sharply, with a series of trades knocking the price from 380p to 330p. </p> <p>There can be no suggestion that either company or their advisers acted improperly. Yet three hours before a formal announcement on the matter, clairvoyant types at some of the City's most prestigious investment banks were telling all callers with some confidence that the deal was off. </p> <p>Insider dealing is rife in the City; it is more common still in the financial centres of continental Europe. Yet trying to eradicate it completely risks undermining the very thing that lubricates markets - namely, a flow of information. </p> <p>The onus is on companies and their advisers to release information quickly and widely when it becomes clear that something price-sensitive has leaked. The sort of nonsense seen in London on Friday simply hurries the day when draconian measures are introduced like the one which hit Wall Street yesterday. </p> <p>Called Regulation FD (for fair disclosure), this securities &amp; exchanges commission initiative slaps a ban on any selective disclosure of market moving information. </p> <p>It sours the cosy relationship between companies and investment bank analysts, killing off \"guidance\" on trading performance and leaks to friendly news outlets. The idea is to protect retail investors who, for too long, have been dealing at a disadvantage to the big professional players. The price will be increased volatility as news, good and bad, surprises rather than confirms. The market, sadly, will also be a bit less fun. </p> <p> <strong> Feeling Blu </strong><br> Italy's auction of its third generation mobile phone licences has turned into a tale of red, white and blue. The Italian government, generally, is red with embarrassment, while budget ministers there are blanching at the size of the hole that has appeared in their fiscal arithmetic. </p> <p>British Telecom is the one left feeling blue. It tried hard within the limits of its balance sheet and shareholders patience (both fairly stretched) to keep its Blu consortium in the bidding. To no avail. Some of its partners proved to have less of an appetite for risk. </p> <p>As a result its strategy now has a gap instead of a 3G licence. It does still have a foothold in Europe's biggest mobile market via earlier Blu licences but this will slip once its rivals are able to launch UMTS -based services. </p> <p>Yet, for BT the setback could be a blessing in disguise. In Britain it has control of its 3G fate and will be in the same position in Germany when it doubles its stake in Viag to 90%. </p> <p>In Spain, however, it is a minority player - as it would have been in Italy and will be in France if Cegetel gets a licence. BT would do well to consider whether its resources are concentrated in ventures where it calls the shots or scattered more widely into deals where its ambitions are at the mercy of partners which may not share its priorities.</p>",
  "Congratulations to Larry Elliott (Return ticket to state control easily bought, October 23) for arguing what so few commentators have had the guts to say - the privatisation of the railways has been a failure and it's time to do something about it. Insofar as there is any logic to privatisation, it's that competition creates more efficiency and consumer choice. Railway privatisation is a joke: if I'm not satisfied with the only rail company providing a service between Cambridge and London, what am I supposed to do - go to Birmingham instead? <p>Nor am I convinced every business hides endless opportunities for greater efficiency and that only the lack of a profit motive prevents these being recognised. My father worked for Post Office Telephones for 45 years before they were privatised and he, like many of his fellow workers, had a commitment to providing a cheap, effective public service. Surely there's more than one way of motivating people? </p> <p>In any case, \"efficiency\" usually means fewer people working longer hours for less money. Call me old-fashioned, but I have a moral objection to that. Even Tory voters recognise the truth of the old maxim, you get what you pay for. Efficiency usually involves cutting corners - one can always get a job done cheaper if you're willing to accept shoddier standards. But when it comes to rail safety, how many more corners are we willing to see cut? Doesn't anyone remember why the railways were nationalised in the first place? </p> <p>The announcement that billions more will be poured into improving rail safety is welcome. But why do we need to enrich Railtrack shareholders? I'd rather see my money spent on addressing environmental concerns, by making rail travel so cheap, safe and convenient that people will leave their cars at home. <br> <b>Jim Endersby</b> <br> Cambridge  <a href=\"mailto: jje21@cam.ac.uk\"> jje21@cam.ac.uk</a></p> <p> \u0095 Why struggle on with an outdated piece of industrial cast-iron heritage; \u00a314.9bn, \u00a3677 per household, is enough to tarmac 12,000 miles of tracks and give cars and buses, the choice of transport for 85% of voters, unprecedented access to town and city centres.

  "<p>Subject to completion it looks like the sold sign will soon be going up outside the offices of <strong> Countrywide Assured</strong>, the UK's biggest estate agent. </p> <p>According to marketplace gossips, Countrywide, owner of the Bairstow Eves chain, will in the course of the next week reveal the conclusions of its strategic review by accepting a bid from an overseas predator. </p> <p>At least three buyers, including one from Italy and another from North America, are said to have tabled offers for Countrywide, which they view as the perfect vehicle to gain a toehold in the competitive British mortgage market. </p> <p>Aside from the estate agency business, Countrywide has two other legs: an army of financial advisers, which specialise in selling mortgages and life assurance products to new homeown ers; and a property survey business. </p> <p>Apparently, almost 50% of the customers who use Countrywide's 750-strong chain of agencies also buy a mortgage from one of its financial advisers. A large proportion also snap up life assurance, critical illness and home insurance products. </p> <p>However, Countrywide is prepared to walk away from the talks if the price is not right. An offer of 130p would be considered derisory and force Countrywide to consider a break-up or remaining as a listed company. </p> <p>Since delivering its disastrous interim figures back in August, trading conditions are said to have improved with the company on course to make around \u00a360m this year. </p> <p>Should Countrywide opt for a break-up it is likely that the management would take the estate agency and surveying businesses private and trade sale the rest.

  "<p><strong> PSHE/citizenship: key stages 3 &amp; 4</strong><br></p> <p>Queen Victoria is known to have taken cannabis to help relieve her period pains. Today, someone doing that risks arrest, imprisonment and a criminal record. Things have changed, but now the pressure is on the government to re-examine the laws forbidding the possession and use of the drug. </p> <p> <strong> Why is cannabis in the news?</strong> </p> <p> Recently, a senior member of the Conservative party, Anne Widdecombe, called for tougher penalties for people caught with cannabis. Immediately, the police condemned her ideas saying they were \"unworkable\". Then 10 of Widdecombe's political colleagues admitted to smoking cannabis in their youth. It was embarrassing for the Conservatives but the muddle prompted a public debate about cannabis and the law. </p> <p> <strong> What is cannabis?</strong> </p> <p> It is a plant related to nettles. People have grown cannabis for thousands of years both as a medicine and a source of a tough fibre called hemp. It originates in Central Asia and probably arrived in Europe in the Middle Ages. One of its most common forms is marijuana. </p> <p> <strong> What is the effect of using it?</strong> </p> <p> Chemicals in cannabis called cannabinoids stimulate certain brain receptors and seem to affect the body's pain relief mechanisms. What people experience depends on the drug's strength and how it is taken. The drug's effects range from making people happy and talkative to feeling insecure (paranoid). The physical impact of the drug is just as varied. Some people who suffer certain serious illnesses such as multiple sclerosis claim cannabis is helpful because it relaxes muscles. </p> <p> <strong> Why is cannabis illegal?</strong> </p> <p> Some people fear cannabis is dangerous. It increases the heart rate and so can harm people with heart conditions. The National Drugs Helpline says cannabis is not physically addictive, but can make people think they want it. Also, people who smoke the drug often mix it with tobacco, which is highly addictive and causes cancer. However, unlike most other drugs, it is impossible to overdose on cannabis. By contrast over 4,000 people die every year in the UK because of drinking alcohol. The other great worry is that cannabis is a \"gateway\" drug which encourages people to try more dangerous substances such as heroin and cocaine. This argument is weakened if you look at Holland, where decriminalisation of cannabis has not had this effect. </p> <p> <strong> What is \"decriminalisation\"?</strong> </p> <p> In Holland cannabis remains officially illegal, but people are allowed to possess it for personal use and it can be sold in specific, carefully monitored \"coffee shops\". This differs from complete \"legalisation\" which would allow cannabis to be sold anywhere. </p> <p> <strong> What is the law in this country?</strong> </p> <p> Under The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, cannabis is classed Grade B. People caught with it can face anything up to five years in prison and/or an unlimited fine. The penalties are worse if someone is convicted of \"dealing\" - supplying the drug, even to a few friends. Often the police decide to caution people they arrest but this still results in an official police record. Over a million people in the UK are in this position. And having a police record makes certain kinds of jobs (teaching) and countries (America) out of bounds. </p> <p> <strong> Isn't this all rather tough?</strong> </p> <p> Some people think so. They argue it's absurd for otherwise law-abiding people to suffer such consequences, saying penalties are not applied equally across the UK and that tough laws do not seem to be stopping anyone from using the drug anyway. </p> <p> <strong> Who are these critics?</strong> </p> <p> The list includes influential people and organisations such as the British Medical Association which has declared that cannabis is \"very safe\"; senior policemen fed up with asking their staff to do an impossible job and wanting to concentrate on the fight against really dangerous drugs; a House of Lords committee that suggested two years ago that cannabis should be made legal for medical use; and recently the Police Foundation, which recommended those cautioned or fined for cannabis offences should not be penalised with a police record. </p> <p> <strong> Are they being listened to?</strong> </p> <p> Tony Blair is resisting the calls for a Royal Commission investigation into the issue, which could lead to a change in the law. </p> <p> <strong> More information:</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Drugs Scope: <a href=\"http://www.drugscope.org.uk\">www.drugscope.org.uk </a> </p> <p> \u0095 For the most recent enquiry into cannabis visit: <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk\">www.parliament.uk</a> clicking on \"index\", then \"r\" for \"research\" followed by \"House of Commons Library\" and then \"2000 reports\". </p> <p> \u0095 Legalise Cannabis Alliance: <a href=\"http://www.lca-uk.org\"> lca-uk.org</a> </p> <p> \u0095 The Independent Drugs Monitoring Unit: <a href=\"http://www.idmu.co.uk\">www.idmu.co.uk</a> </p> <p> \u0095 Police Foundation: <a href=\"http://police-foundation.org.uk/site/Drugs.asp\">police-foundation.org.uk</a> </p> <p> \u0095 National Drugs Helpline, the 24-hour confidential advice and information service can be contacted on 0800 776600.</p>",

  "<p><strong> Roger Theobald, deputy head at Orleans Park school, Twickenham, London</strong> </p> <p> Sit down with your son - investigate with him why there's a \"personality clash\". Has he done something to upset the teacher? For example, no homework, constant chatter, a casual attitude to work or poor behaviour? This may provoke a discussion on school in general. Does he find the work difficult? Has he sought help and, if so, has he had any? </p> <p>Is there anything specific that the teacher has done to upset your child, wittingly or unwittingly, and is he aware of it? Were you able to speak to the teacher without your son present? Was there a frank and fair exchange of views? Could you agree some strategies to help repair the relationship? </p> <p>You could speak to the head of department, provided he or she is not the same teacher. A more senior or perhaps more experienced member of staff may help to resolve the situation. It might be possible to move to a different geography class being taught at the same time, although don't rely on this. Often school timetables have only one group for a subject being taught at any one time, especially if they're mixed ability classes, as it depends on the availability of a teacher. </p> <p>If it's still unresolved, consider involving the head of year as well. It may be possible to change tutor groups, which could lead to a different geography teacher. However, consider the implications of a move to another class. Your son may no longer be with friends or, indeed, with teachers he likes and with whom he is making good progress. </p> <p>There's often not a simple solution. Sometimes pupils will have to learn to deal with difficulties like the one you've described. This, too, can be a valuable learning process. We all have to work with people we don't always get on with; that's just part of life! </p> <p> <strong> Susan Rees, from the Advisory Centre for Education</strong> </p> <p> It's not unusual for children to make subjective judgments about teachers, but it's rarer - and unprofessional - for a teacher to respond in the same way. Your son's geography teacher should be making the first move to overcome the impasse between them. After all, he is the adult! </p> <p>I'd suggest that you go back into the school, see the teacher about the situation and ask how he or she will address it. You could try holding out an olive branch by asking what exactly your son does to irritate him, and offer to speak to your son. Sometimes it can be due to nothing more than a breakdown in effective communication between teacher and pupil: perhaps quietness is misinterpreted as sullenness or a particular stance wrongly perceived as aggressive. </p> <p>If this doesn't resolve things, try approaching either the head of department or the head of year. In this case, be as specific as possible about what has been happening, ie actual incidents and forms of words used which will illustrate your concerns. It's also a good idea to gather evidence of where your son is behaving well and making good progress, to show that the problem in geography is an isolated one (if it is, of course). It may also be that other parents have raised similar concerns about this teacher, and that the head of department will need to deal with the situation personally. Or it could simply be that your son is moved into another geography class. </p> <p>If a teacher is actually using their position to bully and humiliate a child systematically, this is an obvious occasion where parents should act quickly. Such matters need to be taken to a senior member of staff and nipped in the bud before they escalate, and they represent a serious abuse of the power relationship in a classroom. A teacher who rips up a child's work, or is rude and sarcastic on a very personal level, can set the tone for the rest of the class, who often follow this lead. </p> <p>However, a word of caution. Making a complaint against a teacher is tantamount to questioning their whole professional competence, and can spiral very quickly out of your control. If you feel you can deal with things by having a quiet word yourself, this is often the best way to proceed, at least at the start. </p> <p> <strong> Next week's problem:</strong> My daughter has been caught smoking at breaktime in the school toilets. We have clearly told her at home that we will not tolerate her smoking, and it comes as a bit of a blow to find that she can so easily do so at school.

  "<p>Labour's big idea for tackling the nation's growing shortage of essential economic skills will finally be launched tomorrow. </p> <p>Ufi, formerly known as the University for Industry, will officially be opened by David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, although it has been operational for months now. </p> <p>At events around the country a string of celebrities will sign up for courses via learndirect, billed as Britain's first \"e-learning network\", which is at the heart of the Ufi concept. </p> <p>According to its former chairman Lord Dearing, the lifelong learning flagship promises to be as great an achievement for New Labour as the Open University turned out for the Wilson government, after initial scepticism. </p> <p>The concept has moved on since Gordon Brown, then shadow chancellor, unveiled his vision of a university for industry in the Guardian. </p> <p>A big idea is certainly needed if the latest survey on the national workforce is to be believed. Nearly three quarters of British firms are suffering skills shortages, a jump of 26% compared to the previous six months, according to research published by Reed, the recruitment specialist. </p> <p>This is a record increase in reported shortages since the company began its Skills Index over three years ago. The shortfalls are particularly acute in accountancy and information technology. </p> <p>Ufi's mission is to \"make it easy for everyone to get into learning whenever and wherever they want to,\" says Anne Wright, Ufi's chief executive. \"We're concentrating on what they need for work. The kind of skills we're offering are IT, basic literacy and numeracy, and the skills for small businesses.\" </p> <p>Accessibility is seen as crucial for making inroads on the critical mass of adults who left school with few or no skills and have so far been disinclined to return to education, often because their first experience of it was unhappy. </p> <p>These are the group targeted by the government's \"widening participation\" programme but who have not responded to colleges' considerable efforts to entice them in. </p> <p>So far Ufi and its learndirect network, with an \u00a384m budget this year, have opened more than 600 learning centres across England where the public can come in and start a course straight away or find out where they can go for what they need, says Wright. </p> <p>The centres are situated in venues where people often go anyway, such as shopping malls, pubs, community centres and football clubs. </p> <p>Perhaps the oddest venue is Big Top learndirect, which moves around Birmingham with the Robert Wilkinson's travelling funfair. </p> <p>\"It's sandwiched between the dodgems and the shooting arcade,\" says Wright. </p> <p>So far 36,000 people have registered and 77,000 courses have been completed. These have ranged from a one-hour session on time management to programmes of more than 300 hours. </p> <p>Ufi's other important arms are its website - <a href=\"http://www.learndirect.co.uk\">www.learndirect.co.uk</a> - and the learndirect helpline which has taken more than two million calls in two years.</p>",
  "<p>There is growing international evidence that tuition fees put people off university, and that rising fees and student debts are alienating students from poor backgrounds in particular. These are the central conclusions of one of the first UK based studies of the impact of fees in Australian and New Zealand universities, carried out by researchers at the Association of University Teachers. </p> <p>The paper comes amid signs that English education ministers are increasingly isolated in their contention that students are not being deterred from degree courses by rising financial burdens. The Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies look set to follow the Scottish Parliament's footsteps and split away from what are seen as socially divisive student support arrangements originally established for the whole of the UK. </p> <p>Since introducing tuition fees and scrapping maintenance grants for students two years ago, English ministers have claimed that the main factors affecting university enrolments are the attitudes, values and expectations of students from poorer backgrounds, not the increasing costs of degree courses. </p> <p>This cultural explanation figured prominently in official responses to the Oxford admissions row after the state school pupil Laura Spence failed to win a place there. The government is now, for example, allocating funds to universities to hire recruitment spotters and run summer schools. </p> <p>But some fear that financial factors - particularly loss of grants for students' living expenses - are being overlooked in the university access debate. Vice-chancellors last month made a point of considering the restoration of maintenance grants as part of their university funding inquiry. The latest performance figures for universities meanwhile revealed a drop in mature entrants since fees were introduced, and evidence that financial costs are the key factor in explaining different student drop-out rates. </p> <p>The paper, being presented to AUT's education policy committee this week, concludes that demand for degrees is affected by the income, socio-economic background, and academic achievement of students, but also the 'net price' of courses - the combination of tuition fees discounted by financial aid. Research on university enrolments in the USA shows that lower income groups are the first to be influenced by any price changes. \"There is growing international evidence that economic factors such as tuition costs and expected future returns to education are significant barriers to participation in higher education,\" concludes the paper. </p> <p>In New Zealand, where university fees have almost tripled in 10 years, the cost of courses has proved a disincentive to particular groups, including Maori, Pacific Islanders, mature students and those from poor backgrounds. Increased borrowing per student has led to a major increase in student debt. </p> <p>A two-tier system for rich and poor students, meanwhile, is emerging in Australia, with students from affluent backgrounds more likely to secure places on courses where full fees are charged. In 1997, student fees were raised to contribute to 37% of the average cost of undergraduate courses. Universities are now able to impose full-cost fees for up to 25% of students enrolling on a particular course. </p> <p>Increasing pressure is being exerted by a cartel of leading Australian research universities, like the Russell Group universities in the UK, to consider the complete deregulation of fees. </p> <p>But it may be a political storm closer to home that eventually forces English education ministers to review student funding arrangements. One pledge to emerge last week from the three-year, power-sharing agreement between Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs in the Welsh Assembly is \"an immediate investigation into student hardship and funding\". Northern Ireland MPs, have urged the Northern Ireland Assembly to abolish full-time undergraduate tuition costs and re-introduce means-tested maintenance grants. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the National Union of Students next month plan to hold a national day of action against fees.</p>",
  "<p>Peer into the playground at Rowlatts Hill Primary in Leicester this week, and you'll see lots of new play equipment. If it's break-time, you may also notice the children munching apples in place of biscuits. The changes are just two of the school's latest improvements: but they haven't come from the staff, or even the parents. At the 300-pupil school, it's the kids who are in the hotseat when it comes to making the place better. </p> <p>They haven't got carte blanche on everything, of course (although I have it on the highest authority - one of them - that curriculum worries are next in line for consideration). What it's all about, says the head, Jonathan Evans, is taking children's views seriously via an elected school council. </p> <p>Pupil democracy isn't exactly new - look at Summerhill School, the Suffolk independent school that trail-blazed it decades ago - but it is edging up the agenda, and there's some evidence that the Department for Education and Employment may be about to take it more seriously. Peter Facey, chief executive at the British Youth Council, is in discussion with the department about funding for a body to bring together pupil councils nationwide. \"What we're talking to the government about is the fact that, with voting figures on the decline, introducing pupil councils into schools may be one important way of giving young people enthusiasm for participating in the political process,\" he says. </p> <p>The recent, and much-publicised, report into multi-ethnic Britain provided more evidence of a renewed interest in \"pupil power\". The report, which expressed grave concerns about the treatment of ethnic minorities in schools, praised as most successful those schools it dubbed \"listening schools\" - such schools, it said, \"took time to talk with students ... and took seriously the views students and parents offered ...\" Schools that took pupils' views seriously, it concluded, were less likely to need to use exclusion as a sanction, and were more likely to have staff and strategies in place to deal with tensions. </p> <p>Around 50% of secondary schools and 25% of primaries already have a council - although not all are as effective as Rowlatts Hill in giving youngsters a real say. Facey says: \"I've known schools that let the children debate litter control in the playground, and that's about it. But that sort of thing will only increase their cynicism - they've got to feel they are being listened to, and that their views are making a difference.\" </p> <p>Somehow the idea of school councils seems oddly out of step with the flavour of education in Britain today. We're all aware of the current of authoritarianism at the heart of the government's reforms: sitting in rows and getting back to basics on the three Rs doesn't seem to fit with giving youngsters the right to speak out about things they don't like, still less to actually change them. </p> <p>So what's going on? Why is it that pupil councils are a feature of life in an increasing number of schools, and are increasingly effective? Partly, perhaps, it's a backlash against the authoritarianism of the reforms themselves: partly, it's about a general extension of children's rights, particularly in the western world. But partly, too, it's a response to what might seem like a minor reform planned for our schools in 2002, when citizenship becomes a mandatory subject for secondary school pupils and an optional extra for primaries. After all, say the proponents of school councils, if we're teaching our children about rights, participation and democracy, surely there could be no better way than by putting the whole notion into practice in their most immediate community? </p> <p>Derry Hannam, a teacher for more than 20 years and now an educational consultant and adviser to the DfEE, is convinced that pupil power is vitally important. \"Children have a right to be heard, although that's never been a particularly prominent or acceptable position to take in this country,\" he says. Indeed, one only has to look at the treatment meted out to Summerhill to see quite how unpopular this trend has been in Britain: the tabloid press seems obsessed with the idea of kids ruling the roost and making a hash of things. </p> <p>In fact, says Hannam, the very reverse would seem to be the case. \"School councils are actually a very effective way to improve things,\" he says. \"Children know a lot about what's working in a school, as well as what's going on generally.\" When it comes to change, kids are often a lot wiser than a lot of grown-ups might think - take that decision to ban biscuits in favour of apples, for example. </p> <p>What's more, says Hannam, \"Giving children a voice raises their self-esteem and self-image as learners, which in turn enhances attainment.\" </p> <p>Then there's that curriculum change to include citizenship. \"There are some things that can only be learned through participation, and that includes democracy,\" says Hannam. \"One of the main ideas behind the addition of citizenship to the curriculum is that children should develop participation skills and learn how to act as citizens, and you can only develop these by participating and taking action. There's a mountain of research that shows you can't just lecture about democracy: it's simply in one ear and out the other.\" </p> <p>Not so at Cotham School in Bristol, where the student council has been in place for three years since the appointment of the head, James Wetz, another firm believer in pupil democracy. Cotham is an 11-18 co-educational school with 1,240 pupils on its roll: the council is made up of 100 councillors representing each tutor group in the school. </p> <p>The council is chaired by two sixth-formers, and two of its members are observers on the governing body, where they have a voice if not a vote. They can listen to most business though they have to withdraw before confidential issues are raised. Council meetings are held every five weeks, and aren't seen at Cotham as an optional extra: they're held in lesson-time, important enough for the pupil-councillors to miss a class. </p> <p>Council members also sit on five action teams, which cover the school's catering, facilities, environment, equal rights and charity work. Each team has the support of a teacher, and secretarial and organisational back-up is provided by a parent volunteer. Wetz attends council meetings and hears all the debate and decisions: at a recent meeting, he says, he was struck by a child's remark that \"in the hands of the few, power corrupts\". </p> <p>Like Rowlatts Hill, Cotham has been changed by its student council: it had a role, for example, in awarding the school's catering contract, and Wetz was impressed at how seriously the children took the task of visiting another school to see the would-be caterer in action, and how closely they vetted the contract. Fears that power devolved to children is power unappreciated seem groundless: if anything, kids seem to take decisions more seriously. </p> <p>On the whole, says Wetz, the council has been widely admired and welcomed, and there have been few criticisms - just one or two from parents concerned at children missing lessons for council meetings. He makes no apologies for this: to be given its proper importance, attendance at a democratic gathering must take priority over other work for its members. </p> <p>The years of the council's existence have coincided with a steady and significant climb in the school's academic results, and Wetz describes its latest GCSE and key stage 3 results as excellent. There are a few things he's not entirely happy about - wider participation in the council by other pupils, and children's frustration at not being able to change things overnight - but in general pupil democracy at Cotham works well. </p> <p>Indeed, if it doesn't work well, schools could be doing their pupils more harm than good. According to Hannam, there's nothing quite so guaranteed to lead to cynicism about democracy than a pupil council that's not taken seriously, or which doesn't genuinely allow students' views to make a difference. And with citizenship about to appear on the curriculum, that would seem to be an indefensible mistake for any school to be making. </p> <p> <strong>What the pupils think: </strong><br></p> <p><strong> Rowlatts Hill Primary </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Elise Blockley, 8</strong> </p> <p>It's been fun looking at the brochures to see what we'd like to have in the playground.

  "<p>Last week's announcement that, from 2002, all five-year-olds would be set a compulsory test sparked a furore. Tabloid newspapers immediately offered parents (conflicting) advice on how to get their five-year-olds through the test, while parents' groups expressed concern about this additional pressure on children and dismissed it as \"yet another move towards selection\". </p> <p>So, should parents be worried - is this testing gone mad? The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), which made the announcement, was keen to reassure parents. They studiously avoided using the word \"test\", preferring the more neutral \"baseline assessment\", and emphasised that nothing was set in stone - a consultation process was under way that would include parents. </p> <p>The assessment of young children is, they added, nothing new. Children as young as four have been tested for 10 years. What is happening now is simply a rationalisation of the existing system. Under the new proposals, all schools will use the same assessment method (at present over 90 different schemes are in use) and all children will be tested at the same point in their school career - at the end of the recently introduced \"foundation stage\" of the national curriculum, when they are five (at present, children can be assessed at any time during their first year at school). </p> <p>On the ground, however, the worry feels real enough. Angus Pryor has a four-year-old who has just started school in Kent. His son, Hal, is to be assessed this term, and the school's description of the tests awaiting him provided little reassurance. </p> <p>\"It's only just dawned on me what the assessment is,\" said Angus. \"My concern is they are going to test in a very academic way. At the parents' evening where we were told about the assessment, I asked how Hal was doing creatively and socially. They had nothing to say on that. But we were told about the need to prepare even the youngest children for the 11-plus. It felt like our four-year-old was being set up for selection already. I don't really care if he can form a 'C' just yet; I simply want him to be happy.\" </p> <p>Other parents contacted by the Guardian shared Angus's concerns. \"I don't want him to be in an overly academic environment,\" says Iona Gibson, whose five-year-old son John started school in south London this term and is currently being assessed. </p> <p>\"There doesn't seem to be any singing or playing any more. It's all heads down now that John's left the nursery.\" Gibson admits that part of her concern is a lack of information . </p> <p>\"I don't know what he's doing, I don't know how much to worry.\" John doesn't appear to have been bothered by the assessments, she says, but, like a lot of parents of very young children, she feels left out of the information loop. \"Does this mean that they are going to stream my child?\" she asks. </p> <p>The answer is almost certainly no. Desk setting, where children work together in ability groups, does happen in primary schools, but not with the youngest children and not for all of the time. But it is hardly surprising that she is worried. </p> <p>\"'Test' is a very emotive term,\" says Pat Wills, who chairs Early Education, an organisation of educators who specialise in children of this age. Wills is also headteacher of Claremont Primary School in Blackpool. \"These aren't sit-down examinations, they're based on observation of what a child can do carried out over several days.\" </p> <p>And tots will not face a test in their first week in school as some of the tabloids alleged. \"The assessment will come at the end of the foundation stage,\" said Pat Wills, which for some children could be up to two years into school. Pat Wills is supportive of the proposed national system. It is good for the child, she insists, because now all children will have had at least one year's schooling before they are assessed. And the information will help teachers target their teaching. </p> <p>\"You can't work without some understanding of a child's stage of development,\" she says. \"High-flyers may be able to read at four, but some others will never have handled a book. Teachers need this knowledge.\" </p> <p>And it is also good news for schools, especially those in poorer areas. Baseline assessments are an essential part of the value-added measures that ministers hope will eventually replace league tables based on raw examination results. It is believed that many schools in leafy areas are \"coasting\", achieving good results - and good reputations - simply as a result of the background of their children, rather than from teaching excellence. For value-added information to be complete, some assessment needs to be made at the start of a child's school career. </p> <p>Claremont primary is unusual in having a leading early years specialist like Wills as a headteacher. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the school has gone to greater lengths than many to ensure the foundation stage curriculum and baseline assessments work well. It restructured the early years setting ready for the new foundation curriculum this September, with three classrooms for the youngest children and new staff to support the teaching. </p> <p>\"We've had the national curriculum for 10 years,\" says Wills. \"But there's always been a grey area about when it started. The foundation stage clarifies that they don't start until year 1, giving over a year of school time without things like the literacy hour to pressure the children's day.\" </p> <p>Claremont's three classrooms are full of toys, books and games, but each focuses on different aspects of learning. Some parents are concerned that children aren't moving onto \"proper learning\", but the school firmly believes that structured play is the best learning environment for the four- and five-year-old. </p> <p>A key factor in its success are the two nursery nurses attached to each classroom. \"Here we have a staff:pupil ratio of 1:12,\" says Wills. The extra staff make the observation and monitoring involved in the new baseline tests easier to manage, but Claremont's nursery nurses have not been funded from additional government money. Wills claims that there has been no central government support. </p> <p>\"Absolutely no money whatsoever,\" she says. \"We've had good training from the local education authority, but we've had the find the money for our nursery nurses from our own resources.\" </p> <p>Yet early years is the one area where research has shown clear benefits from smaller classes. A study by London's Institute of Education published this year revealed impressive learning gains for five-year-olds taught in smaller classes. </p> <p>Wills would like to see more money pumped into provision for the youngest children along with a drive to inform parents about the changes. \"Some parents are desperate for their child to begin reading from day one,\" she said. Others are concerned about an early academic diet. </p> <p>But an equal concern is the question of how many schools will follow Claremont's example. The Blackpool primary is a very large school where economies of scale allow the kind of staffing that many rural schools would find too costly. Few heads are early years specialists and there may well be pressure on reception class teachers to implement the kind of academic regime that worries many parents. Will schools be able to run the new tests in the unobtrusive, diagnostic way that Wills argues should be the norm? </p> <p>Iona Gibson has just one priority: \"I just think that play is so important,\" she says. \"That and the opportunity for him to settle into the school environment and enjoy himself.\" </p> <p> <strong>What a five-year-old should be able to do</strong><br></p> <p> This is not a 'test' with right and wrong answers, but a way of assessing each child's development in a number of areas - from basic to more advanced understanding. <br> </p> <p><strong> Reading</strong> Basic level: do they hold a book correctly and understand about turning pages? Difficult level: can they read a familiar book accurately? </p> <p><strong> Writing</strong> Basic: do they know the difference between pictures and text? Difficult: can they write a few simple three-letter words?</p> <p> <strong> Letter knowledge</strong> Basic: does the child recognise his or her name? Difficult: do they know the letters of the alphabet? </p> <p><strong> Number</strong> Basic: can they sort objects into different types? Difficult: Can they add and subtract to a total of 10? </p> <p><strong> Mathematical language</strong> Basic: Can they use paired words like larger/smaller? Difficult: Can they use words like 'plus', 'add' and 'equals'?</p> <p> <strong> Speaking and listening</strong> Basic: Can they describe two events or experiences? Difficult: Can they tell a story they have made up themselves? </p> <p><strong> Understanding sounds</strong> Basic: Can they recite a nursery rhyme? Difficult: Can they write letters to match the sounds of some simple words? </p> <p><strong> Personal development</strong> Basic: Do they play with others? Difficult: Can they have a conversation with adults where they express opinions and ideas?</p>",
  "<p>As the Pete'n'Steve show prepares for its gig in Turin next month, Adam Crozier, the Football Association's chief executive, will be sounding out the three candidates Lancaster Gate has shortlisted for the England job long-term. </p> <p>Two of them are reckoned to be Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Frenchman who has restored pride and success to Arsenal as well as adding a style that was largely missing previously, and Sven Goran Eriksson, the experienced and widely respected Swedish coach of Lazio. </p> <p>The identity of the third man is more of a mystery. Apparently it is not Roy Hodgson, whose success as an English coach in taking Switzerland to the 1994 World Cup was thought to have put him in the frame, while Terry Venables, the popular choice among public and fellow professionals, looks beyond the fringe of likely candidates. </p> <p>The FA's admiration of Sir Alex Ferguson goes back a distance and, although Crozier is a relatively recent arrival, it is a feeling which he, a fellow Scot, will share. Ferguson seems determined to quit football after next season, although Manchester United could persuade him to stay on in some capacity, and is adamant that he is not available for England. But the FA may see no harm in hoping and the England coaching contract will be worth even more than the \u00a31m a year Kevin Keegan was getting. </p> <p>Certainly Wenger, Eriksson and Ferguson all meet the criteria set down by Crozier and his task force. These demand that the next England coach should have a successful record, international experience (presumably at club or representative level), tactical awareness, an ability to handle pressure, focus on the job, make decisions, communicate easily with players, inspire teams, have a long-term com mitment and, not least, be a man of integrity. </p> <p>Timing will be a crucial factor in whatever decision Crozier and his team reach in making the appointment. Wenger's contract at Arsenal, like Ferguson's at Old Trafford, does not expire until 2002. One of Eriksson's attractions is that his contract with Lazio ends next summer. </p> <p>Yet, because it is hard to see anyone the FA appoints being ready to take charge before next June, the question of who runs the team in the meantime, with World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania in March, remains vague. </p> <p>Should Peter Taylor and Steve McClaren get the England team to play as well against Italy as they did, say, against France in September, when a creditable 1-1 draw briefly boosted morale, the case for the pair being asked to resume control for the friendly against Spain at Villa Park in February and the two qualifiers in March will be strong. </p> <p>But would Leicester City and Manchester United be quite so willing to release, respectively, a manager and an assistant manager as the season reaches its climax? And, if not, just how many more caretakers would be available, always assuming that Howard Wilkinson, the technical director, has now been left to spend more time with his clipboards? </p> <p>For England the short-term situation is that the wrong man might be available at the right time and vice versa. Bobby Robson would have been ideal but it is hard to blame Newcastle United for not wanting to let him out of their sight, having at last got the manager they wanted after a series of blunders. </p> <p><strong> Ars\u00e8ne Wenger</strong> </p> <p><strong> Nationality</strong> French. <strong> Age</strong> 51 </p> <p><strong> Success</strong> Won the French championship in his first season at Monaco plus the French cup three years later. Within two years of taking over at Arsenal he led the club to its second league and FA Cup double, transforming that most English of teams in the process. He also taught Steve Bould how to pass. </p> <p><strong> International experience</strong> Geographically wide, having been voted manager of the year in France and Japan. Wenger's European mileage with Monaco and Arsenal is respectable without being spectacular. He is overdue a run in the Champions League and will be disappointed if Arsenal do not at least reach the quarter-finals this time. </p> <p><strong> Tactical nous</strong> Impressive. He has that priceless ability to integrate playing strengths into a tactical pattern while preserving the individuality of talents such as Patrick Vieira and Dennis Bergkamp. Wenger's teams are invariably fluent and flexible, based on strength in defence but only as a means to attack. </p> <p><strong> Integrity</strong> Beyond reproach even if he is facing a 12-match FA ban from the touchline for an alleged incident with the fourth official after Arsenal's game at Sunderland on the opening day. Wenger is prepared to go to court to prove his innocence and, while Emile Zola is no longer around to cry 'J'accuse !' little Gianfranco might put in a kind word. </p> <p><strong> Motivation </strong> He is more likely to inspire teams by what he does not say. Neither a ranter nor a cheerleader, Wenger believes that a quiet word is worth a dozen imprecations. Footballers respect his knowledge even though his own playing career was modest. His conversion of Thierry Henry from winger to striker says it all. </p> <p> <strong> Sven Goran Eriksson</strong></p> <p> <strong>Nationality </strong> Swedish. <strong> Age </strong> 52 </p> <p><strong> Success </strong> Wherever Eriksson has gone he has struck gold. One Swedish championship, three in Portugal and another in Italy, plus an assortment of cups mark him out as a coach with the winning touch. His teams expect to win things, a crucial ingredient for success. He rarely fails. </p> <p><strong> International experience</strong> In his travels from Scandinavia to Portugal, Rome, Florence and so on Eriksson has built up an impressive knowledge of working with some of the world's best players. The fact that most of his career has been spent in Italy, where coaches are on a tightrope, is in itself a prime recommendation. </p> <p><strong> Tactical nous</strong> Eriksson would not have lasted long in Serie A without knowing the wrinkles. In a changing game he has kept abreast of events. Last season his Lazio side struck the right balance of attacking flair and defensive solidity to win the championship narrowly from Juventus. </p> <p><strong> Integrity</strong> No problem there. Eriksson would easily meet the FA's requirement for a coach with integrity plus the ability to focus solely on the job, make decisions, communicate easily with the players (his English is perfect) and handle the media. Of the three on the shortlist he might be the ideal choice. </p> <p><strong> Motivation </strong> Again Eriksson's record speaks for itself. Like Wenger he emits a sense of inner calm which goes down well in dressing rooms before and during big games. However strong the passions may be below the surface, the ability to keep a lid on them can be useful when it comes to making important decisions in the heat of the moment. </p> <p><strong> Sir Alex Ferguson</strong> </p> <p><strong>Nationality </strong> Scottish. <strong> Age </strong> 58 </p> <p><strong> Success </strong> Unique in Britain. Ferguson is the only manager to win league and cup doubles in both Scotland, with Aberdeen, and England, with Manchester United. Last year's completion of the treble of Premiership, FA Cup and European Cup was his supreme moment. That plus six Premiership titles in eight seasons and still counting . . . </p> <p><strong> International experience</strong> Brief and controversial in World Cup terms. Ferguson took over the Scotland team for the 1986 tournament following the death of Jock Stein and left Alan Hansen out of the squad, whereupon Kenny Dalglish withdrew in sympathy. His European record with Aberdeen and United is rather better. </p> <p><strong> Tactical nous </strong> A traditionalist in that he has always maintained a belief in a back four with orthodox wingers. When the wingers are David Beckham and Ryan Giggs Ferguson's style brooks little argument but he so nearly got it wrong against Bayern Munich in the 1999 European Cup final before United won in stoppage time. </p> <p><strong> Integrity</strong> As straight as they come, Ferguson is no dissembler. Those who offend him get both barrels and his autobiography upset one or two former colleagues, but he is essentially a good man of football with a passionate devotion to the game and a fierce defender of its traditions. </p> <p><strong> Motivation </strong> It was said that the dressing room at Aberdeen witnessed more flying saucers than southern California when Fergie was in charge. Either way he has never lost the ability to transmit a deep, burning hunger for success to his players and the fact that even now he can still get angry says everything about his enduring love for the game.</p>",
  "<p>There is growing international evidence that economic factors such as tuition costs are significant barriers to participation in higher education. The evidence from Australia and especially New Zealand shows that financial factors cannot be ignored in the university access debate.</p> <p>Demand for higher education is affected by income, socio-economic background, academic achievement and net price (the combined effect of tuition discounted by financial aid). Econometric research on university enrolments, for example from the USA, shows that lower income groups are the most price sensitive.</p> <p>In the UK, the importance of economic factors in explaining different participation rates has been contested: it is argued that the attitudes and values of lower socio-economic groups towards higher education is a more significant issue. This cultural explanation figured prominently in official responses to the Laura Spence admissions.</p> <p>Rob Copeland is research officer (education policy) at the Association of University Teachers. The article is based on a paper to be considered this week by the AUT's education policy committee.</p> <p>But since then, financial issues have returned to the English discussion on access. The committee of vice-chancellors and principals, for example, has added restoring the maintenance grant to its funding options inquiry. The liberal democrats have come out in favour of abolishing tuition fees and restoring the maintenance grant.</p> <p>There have also been calls for an independent inquiry into the impact of the government's new funding arrangements. Finally, financial costs appear to be a key factor in explaining differential student drop-out rates at institutions.</p> <p>The new evidence from Australia and New Zealand, where differential tuition fees and student loans are firmly established, confirms that economic costs are central to determining university participation rates.</p> <p>The last two decades have seen a dramatic shift in the burden of higher education costs from being borne predominantly by government, or taxpayers, to being shared with parents and students. This so-called 'cost sharing' has taken various forms: tuition fees have been introduced for the first time, or been rapidly increased; student grants have been abolished or reduced, to be replaced by loans; and public institutions have charged 'market' prices for accommodation, books, and other costs of student living that may previously have been subsidised by the government.</p> <p>In 1990 the New Zealand government deregulated the tertiary education sector, allowing institutions to set fees and opening the door to private education providers. Since then, government funding of student tuition has declined annually from around 85% to around 72% of full costs. During the 1990s there were also significant increases in fees ? an average of 14.4% for full-time students over the past 5 years. Increasing participation, higher fees and subsequent increased borrowing per student has led to a major increase in student debt.</p> <p>On most indicators - level of interest rates, threshold for repayment of loans, range of fees and level and availability of student allowances - the New Zealand system is comparatively harsh on students. There is accumulating evidence that the system is a significant barrier to participation for particular groups. Up-front fees and deferred costs of courses are a disincentive to many New Zealanders, particularly Maori, Pacific Islanders, mature students and those from low socio-economic backgrounds.</p> <p>In order to stem criticism on the financial issue, New Zealand's new left-wing coalition government has provided sufficient money to enable every public institution to freeze their fees and compulsory charges in 2001-02. This ends a decade of fee rises which have seen average fees rise 180%.</p> <p>In Australia a small charge was first introduced on overseas students in 1980. Five years later full cost fees were charged. From 1986 universities were allowed to charge fees for some vocational postgraduate degrees and the following year home students were required to pay an 'administration charge'.</p> <p>More significantly, in 1988 the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) system was introduced which meant that students were required to pay a 'contribution' upfront at a discount, or after graduation through the tax system, once their incomes reached a certain level. In 1996 the contribution was 23% of the average cost of undergraduate courses. The following year it was raised to 37%, starting with new entrants. Under the scheme, students can defer what they owe until they are earning more than A$20,000 a year.</p> <p>At the same time, prime minister John Howard's government ended the long-standing ban on public universities charging the full cost of tuition. For the past three years, universities have been able to impose full-cost fees for up to 25% of students enrolling on a particular course. Only a dozen universities have so far decided to offer full-fee places, but the number of institutions and students involved is likely to increase. Students from affluent backgrounds are also more likely to secure places on these leading courses. Over 90% of these 'full-fee' institutions offer lower entry scores for those students able to pay the full amount.</p> <p>The impact of HECS has dominated the widening participation debate in Australia. Some argue that it has a very minor influence, if any at all, on the low participation by poorer socio-economic groups. Others emphasise the importance of the level of student debt. HECS-style deferred systems have a negative impact on student participation when debt grows beyond a certain level. The current Australian system may be approaching this level.</p> <p>Evidence also suggests that postgraduate fees have begun to impact upon participation rates. Research from the mid-1990s found fees to have a deterrent effect on enrolment in postgraduate courses, which in practice helped to direct some groups, particularly women and lower socio-economic classes, towards cheaper courses</p> <p>The debate in Australia also shows some similarities with the UK in terms of the \"cartelization\" of universities according to mission statements. Leading Australian research universities, as with elements in the Russell Group (the UK's 'elite' research universities), are keen to see market-style tuition fees as a way of boosting funding. They favour deregulated fees, a voucher-based funding model and increased university autonomy.</p> <p>Recent trends in the UK (declining numbers of mature students, rises in Scottish applications after fees were scrapped, high student drop-out rates at inner-city, post-92 universities) appear to echo those witnessed in the southern hemisphere. The implication is that, as student debt and fees increase, inequalities are likely to widen.</p> <p>Rob Copeland is research officer (education policy) at the Association of University Teachers.
