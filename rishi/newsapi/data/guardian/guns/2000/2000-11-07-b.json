Subs: Biancarelli, Riise, Gravelaine, Wagneau, Leonard, Prso, Rodriguez. </p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Lubos Michel (Slovakia) </p> <p><strong>1</strong> Rangers kick off. Crunch time for Dick Advocaat and Rangers tonight as they walk the European plank and attempt to salvage their Champions League campaign with victory progression to the second phase. Ditto Monaco, which all makes for a very interesting night at Ibrox.<br> <strong>2</strong> Monaco make an early break down the right flank with Simone.<br> <strong>3 GOAL</strong> Frantic pace as both teams seek to gain an early advantage without actually showing any cohesion in their play. Rangers take up temporary residence in the Monaco half, but the ball comes out to Albertz on the half-way line - he fires it down the left for Ferguson to cross first time. The bounce leaves Contreras flailing and Miller is on the far side of the six-yard box to fire home with a right-foot shot.<br> <strong>6</strong> No let up in the pace after this dream start for Rangers. <br> <strong>8</strong> Monaco look rattled and are making too many errors on the ball. Rangers start to knock it around at the back a bit and manage to calm things down.<br> <strong>9</strong> Rangers taking control of the game as de Boer races on to a long ball and into yards of space on the right; he crosses for Mols who is charging towards the area, but Christanval does well to intercept and clear.<br> <strong>14</strong> Rangers try to work the ball up on the left from a free-kick, to no avail. <br> <strong>15</strong> Mols looks to be struggling a little and is lucky to avoid a booking when he mis-times a challenge and leaves a Monaco player for dead. <br> <strong>17</strong> Despite struggling, Mols performs some fancy footwork to make use of the space that Monaco are allowing Rangers at the back.<br> <strong>18</strong> Rangers come close to a second when Miller shoots from just inside the area; Mols is unlucky with the rebound.<br> <strong>19</strong> Monaco corner on the right. Simone takes and Rangers clear, but Simone recovers the chance and cuts inside for a shot into the crowd.<br> <strong>20</strong> Miller gets away on the left, but his cross is blocked.<br> <strong>24</strong> A brief period of, well, nothing really. A few taps back to keeper by both teams and the game has slows down a bit. That's it until Monaco realise they have a game to win and fire in a couple of speculative crosses that Rangers have no trouble clearing. Rangers get caught offside a couple of times.<br> <strong>27</strong> Giuly starts a move on the edge of the Rangers area that ends with Nonda missing what looked like a sitter after good work by Simone to keep a cross in play on the edge of the six-yard box.<br> <strong>31</strong> Mols again manages to turn a defender in the blink of an eye, but Monaco are making most of the running - shame they can't get their attacking play sorted out. <br> <strong>32</strong> Monaco free-kick 35 yards out. Simone takes towards the head of Contreras in the six-yard box but the ball goes over.<br> <strong>33</strong> A long ball from just inside the Rangers half finds Mols in acres of space and not even one on one, but his right-foot shot goes wide.<br> <strong>37</strong> Monaco push up and win a free-kick 30 yards out to the left. Simone taps for Dabo to fire over the bar.<br> <strong>38</strong> Numan gets up on the left for Rangers and crosses from just inside the Monaco area for Miller to shoot wide.<br> <strong>39 GOAL</strong> Simone whips in a corner from the right and Da Costa meets the ball to head in the equaliser.<br> <strong>41</strong> Rangers reeling now as Nonda turns Vidmar on the edge of the area and drags his shot just wide of the far post.<br> <strong>42</strong> Monaco corner. Simone takes again and the lanky Christanval is unlucky to see his header go over.<br> <strong>45</strong> De Boer glides through midfield, finds Ricksen on the right, picks up the return and wins a free-kick. Monaco break with Nonda but Vidmar gets across to cut him off. Half-time.</p> <p> <strong>46</strong> Nonda kicks off for Monaco and Simone hoofs the ball up to Christenson in the Rangers goal. <br> <strong>47</strong> Monaco almost take the lead after Amoruso dwells on the ball and allows Simone to break through the back line. He runs it too far and after some fancy, but insignificant, jigging around, Rangers clear.<br> <strong>50</strong> Nonda races away from Vidmar down the right, but Vidmar recovers well to chop him down under the guise of well-timed sliding tackle.<br> <strong>52 GOAL</strong> Mols, clean through just inside the area, waits to read the bounce of a high lob over the back line and shoots past Porato to put Rangers in the lead. <br> <strong>56 Substitution</strong> Tugay on for Mols. <br> <strong>57 Substitution</strong> Prso on for Nonda.<br> <strong>58</strong> Rangers corner from the left; Porato gathers easily.<br> <strong>60</strong> Da Costa feeds Giuly on the right but his cross is gathered by Christensen.<br> <strong>62</strong> Monaco coming forward with determination now and it's clear Rangers are going to have to fight to get a result.<br> <strong>63</strong> Rangers have a chance to wrap things up when Numan, on the left edge of the Monaco area, crosses for Ferguson to shoot high into the crowd.<br> <strong>55 Booking</strong> Gravelaine for chopping down Ricksen.<br> <strong>67</strong> Simone finds Giuly in the Rangers area but Numan does well to hustle him out and clear.<br> <strong>68</strong> Giuly now an ever-present threat, but Rangers manage to break as Albertz finds Miller in space on the left. Miller gets into the area and then fluffs his chance to get a second.<br> <strong>70 Booking</strong> Dabo for a challenge on Albertz, who needs to go off for some attention as a result.<br> <strong>72</strong> Monaco are not giving up. Simone is charging around trying to do the job of three men, despite the fact the the three men around him are happy to do their bit. <strong>75</strong> Dabo shoots from 30 yards but only sees it fly into the crowd.<br> <strong>77</strong> Albertz gets on the end of a Miller cross from the right but his shot from the edge of the area is saved.<br> <strong>78 GOAL</strong> Disaster for Rangers just seconds after Albertz's chance. Prso slides the ball through to Simone and he runs across Christensen before putting a shot past the Rangers keeper at the far post. <strong>Substitution</strong> Wallace on for De Boer.</p> <p> <strong>83</strong> Rangers continue to live dangerously as a cross and header by Monaco only just clears the bar. <br> <strong>84</strong> Manic stuff now as both teams try to get the elusive winner that will see them through to the next round.<br> <strong>85 Substitution</strong> McCann on for Albertz. Rangers corner from the left - Gravelaine hooks it clear from the goal-line.<br> <strong>86</strong> Monaco free-kick from wide on the left, but it is too deep for everyone in the area.<br> <strong>87</strong> Wallace controls the ball well 30 yards out, but opts to snatch at a long-range shot instead of looking around him for other options.<br> <strong>90</strong> Rangers free-kick deep on the left; handball given against Rangers. McCann gets away on the left and crosses superbly but Wallace cannot make his shot count. Rangers last chance? Monaco then come close when Bonnal drags his shot wide of the far post. Monaco's last chance? End to end of stuff.... but that's it, full-time. Both Monaco and Rangers go out of the competition, Rangers fate assured after Sturm Graz and Galatasaray potter around for the last few minutes of their 2-2 draw in Istanbul after hearing the result in Scotland.</p>",
  "Today America will begin to say farewell. It will be a long goodbye, one that fits the outsized character of the man. For the United States has three months to let go of a leader who has, by turns, enthralled, appalled and seduced them for eight compelling years. Bill Clinton won't officially become the ex-president till a minute past noon on January 20 2001, but by late tonight he will be yesterday's man. He will lose his throne, either to his appointed heir or to the son of the king he slayed to get there. One of them will be the president-elect and, in a heartbeat, Clinton will slip from emblem of America's present to holdover from America's past. <p>His fellow Americans will miss him - more, perhaps, than they realise. They'll miss the two terms of peace and record prosperity, of course, but they might even miss the psychodrama: an eight-year rollercoaster ride so turbulent that those who followed it become queasy at the recollection. They'll miss the daily triumphs and disasters of a character of Shakespearean complexity, a president who stirred in the American people passions of love and hatred unseen since the days of John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon - and almost never aroused by a single man. Above all, they will miss his signature feature, one which may well have redefined the presidency itself: an almost eerie gift for empathy. </p> <p>I will miss him, too. For the years of Clinton's American journey matched my own. I first came to live and work in the country in 1992, just as he exploded on to the national scene. I watched him run for president, and stayed to see him do the job. From then on, and for several years, I either watched, read or wrote about Clinton nearly every day. Just as future TV documentary makers keen to evoke the 1990s will flash up an image of the president, I suspect that, when I look back on my late 20s or early 30s, I will do the same. And tonight that era will come to a close. </p> <p>The memories come so fast that it's not easy to separate them. That 1992 election alone was so chock-full of scandal and turnarounds, such a vintage campaign, that it's hard to forget any of it - whether it was Gennifer with a G, the Vietnam draft-dodging letter, written by Clinton while a student at Oxford, or Hillary on 60 Minutes insisting she had been no Tammy Wynette standing by her man, and that if you didn't like her husband, then, \"Heck, don't vote for him.\" </p> <p>It was a crazy year, but it was that Clinton gift for empathy which saw him through. I had heard about it before - Republicans had already ridiculed the Arkansas governor's tendency to begin sentences with \"I feel\" rather than \"I think\", a habit that reached its apotheosis in the legendary \"I feel your pain.\" But there was no substitute for seeing it in action. </p> <p>Of course there were the moments widely witnessed, such as those few seconds during one of the televised debates, when the candidates were asked how the recession had affected them personally. Clinton turned the query around, asking the questioner how she had suffered. Meanwhile, his opponent, George Bush Snr, was caught on camera checking his watch. </p> <p>But there were also the tiny episodes, too small to be reported in their own right, which offered a glimpse of Clinton's sheer talent for people. It's perhaps hard, after this year's lacklustre contest, to imagine the excitement Clinton generated that autumn. \"The failed governor of a small southern state,\" the Republicans had called him. But the voters didn't see it that way. I remember two moments from a Clinton-Gore bus tour through the American heartland. It was a swing through southern Georgia and the buzz was palpable. People didn't just attend rallies, they lined the highways in crowds to catch a glimpse of the man who would be president. Some held banners urging the young governor with the gargantuan appetite (he can eat a whole apple in a single bite) to stop awhile and sample the local peaches or peanuts - and he always did. </p> <p>His aides would get enraged, every stop delaying the tour by a few more crucial minutes. By the end of a campaign day, Clinton would be running four or five hours late, but it didn't matter. In the town square at Valdosta a crowd that had gathered for a 9pm rally waited till 2am. Under floodlights on that September night, they cheered themselves hoarse. </p> <p>Earlier that day, we'd been in a small town called Tifton. Clinton had delivered the usual stump speech, his throat sore, when it began to pour with rain. The reporters ran for cover, inside a makeshift press room where there was the usual supply of chicken drumsticks and Diet Coke. Eventually an Israeli journalist tapped me on the shoulder. \"Come outside,\" he said. \"Look at this.\" </p> <p>The candidate was still out there, shaking the hands of fewer than a dozen elderly voters who had stayed out in the rain. He was talking to each one - not just a \"Hi, how are you,\" but a proper conversation - as the rain streamed down his face and theirs. His aides were urging him to hurry out, desperate to whisk him on to the bus and into a new shirt. This was not a pose to show how much he cared about ordinary people: there was not a single camera to record it. Besides me and the Israeli, no one saw it. But Clinton did it all the same. </p> <p>Who knows why? Maybe the legend was right: maybe Clinton believed that so long as he met every single voter in America, they would all vote for him. Maybe his childhood (widowed mother, alcoholic stepfather) had left him with a near-addictive need for human contact, affection and adulation. Maybe he just cared. </p> <p>Either way, it worked and worked. The crowds got bigger, his voice got hoarser and the empathy gift won that election. I returned to London determined to get work in America that would let me see the next chapter of the story: how Clinton the candidate would become Clinton the president. </p> <p>The transition was not easy. A dozen books have recounted the political errors of those first months. Day one saw a promise to let gays into the military, a move which only confirmed the brass's worst suspicions about the new, draft-dodging commander-in-chief. Later Hillary Clinton took control of healthcare reform - a move that would bring the administration's greatest defeat. The first lady presented Congress with an almost comically complicated blueprint for a new system: expressed as a diagram, it looked like a circuit-board for the space shuttle. The fact that the plan had been hatched by a taskforce of wonks meeting with Hillary in secret added to its Soviet-era aura. By 1994 the plan was dead, and the Clinton administration badly wounded. </p> <p> Things were no easier for the president himself. The Washington establishment was not sure what to make of this brash southern newcomer. They were both excited by and disdainful of him. They sniffed at the Arkansans who piled into town, supporting their beloved Razorbacks football team with the uncouth chant \"Oooo pig soo-eeee!\" For the Washington elite, Clinton and his friends were hicks, plain and simple. </p> <p>The greybeards also disdained his way of doing business. They heard that the president would have long \"bull sessions\" more akin to the college seminar room than the Oval Office. They saw the pizza delivery bikes skidding up to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, as the young, novice staff worked through the night. While Bush had been a grown-up, Clinton's White House seemed to lack adult supervision. </p> <p>The word of the hour back then was \"unpresidential\". The Washington snobs disliked Clinton's habit of answering reporters' questions while still out of breath, pale thighs wobbling. They winced when he answered an MTV inquiry about his taste in underwear: \"Boxers or briefs?\" </p> <p>What the scolds did not realise was that all this \"unpresidential\" behaviour was connected to the president's greatest strength: his common touch. He was comfortable with people. So when a little girl, invited to the Oval Office to take part in a candle-lighting ceremony to mark the Jewish festival of Chanukah, yelped as her hair caught fire, guess who put out the flames and calmed her nerves? Not an aide, but the prez himself. </p> <p>Clinton was like that Star Trek character, the empath, who can psychically read the emotions of those before him; he had a mind-reader's ability to see into the hearts of any individual or group he faced. </p> <p>I saw the trick at work in Baltimore, when the president was out selling his healthcare package. He was addressing an outdoor crowd of thousands of hospital staff. I was standing among a group of nurses, who began chatting and whispering. Their minds were wandering. Somehow, from faraway, Clinton sensed it. He suddenly declared that his plan really mattered, that it would affect all of them, nurses especially - and that they all had to listen up. The women around me hushed. </p> <p>The gift did not save him from the failure of the healthcare programme, a defeat that was endorsed by 1994's mid-term elections, which the Republicans won by a landslide. Overnight Newt Gingrich became the hottest politician in America, cheerily explaining that he would be prime minister to Clinton's now largely ceremonial president. Soon Clinton was forced to tell a press conference why he and his office were still \"relevant\". </p> <p>But the mood changed. On April 19 1995 a right-wing extremist detonated a bomb at a government building in Oklahoma City, leaving 168 dead. Suddenly the anti-government bile of Gingrich's revolutionaries left a much harsher taste in the mouth: America had seen where such talk could lead. </p> <p>Clinton stepped forward as the calmer voice, leading the Oklahoma families in mourning. Perhaps for the first time, he looked presidential - a father of the nation at a moment of crisis. Just then, America needed a leader who would feel their pain. </p> <p>In fact, though no official would ever say it out loud, mourning worked well for Clinton: he gave good funeral. He knew how to touch just the right nerve. I remember a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, dedicating a memorial to those who had died in the Lockerbie bombing. He spoke well, as always, but it was afterwards that he came into his own. A huddle of relatives gathered around him. He spoke to each of them, but then he extended his big hands to reach the ones who had not pressed forward, the ones too shy to approach the president themselves. He encouraged them and beckoned them closer, his eyes finding the hesitant widow or retiring father who was holding back. Again, I looked around: no cameras. The TV crews had already got their pictures; Clinton was not doing it for appearances' sake. He stayed there a full hour over schedule, maddening his handlers and listening to the stories of bereaved loved ones - and not a word was ever written about it. </p> <p>This talent or knack or psychosis - whatever it was, it secured Clinton's position as president. Groups who had once been suspicious began to like and eventually adore him. </p> <p>Take black Americans. In 1992 they had big doubts about Clinton. He was a white politician from the deep south, a Democrat who had signalled his \"centrist\" credentials by attacking black rapper Sister Souljah and by breaking off from the campaign to return to his home state - to order the execution of a retarded black man convicted of murder. </p> <p> Yet within a few years Clinton would be hailed by Toni Morrison, the African-American Nobel laureate, as \"our first black president\" and by the rapper Ice-T as \"a brother\". What had changed? Clinton had saved affirmative action from the Republican axe, but he'd also signed a welfare reform bill which hit black families hard. No, it wasn't policy which sealed the bond between Clinton and black America. It was a more subtle connection. The president displayed a comfort with black audiences that was unheard of among white politicians. He could deliver an impromptu speech-cum-sermon from the pulpit of a black church that had civil rights activists admitting they had heard nothing so inspiring since the days of Martin Luther King. The result is a white president who enjoys 95% approval ratings among African-Americans to this very day. </p> <p>Jewish voters tell a similar story. They were wary of a southern baptist Democrat in 1992: they feared he might be another Jimmy Carter, too sympathetic to the Palestinians. But Clinton reassured them, using his secret weapon: emotional intelligence. It was his instinct and body language that led to that 1993 handshake on the White House lawn between the PLO's Yasser Arafat and Israel's Yitzhak Rabin. And when Rabin was assassinated two years later, it was Clinton who knew how to massage Israel's wounded spirit. He spoke to them, via TV, in their own language, addressing the dead Rabin with the words \"Shalom chaver\" - goodbye friend. The phrase had not existed in Hebrew before then; now it's common Israeli parlance. And so, in 1996, Jewish Americans turned out - alongside blacks and women and Hispanics and trade unions and every other group who felt understood by Clinton - to give him four more years. </p> <p>I took that as my cue to head back to Britain. I reckoned we'd seen the best of Clinton. The second term would be more of the same, only less so. And for the first year, 1997, I seemed to be vindicated: the economy prospered on auto-pilot and Clinton barely had to break a sweat. But in the first weeks of 1998 the sky fell in. The allegations of a dress-staining affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, the finger-wagging denial, the talk of perjury and impeachment - it all came so fast. The Washington punditocracy predicted that the Arkansas hick would be sent back to Little Rock by the end of the week. But they forgot who they were dealing with. Clinton was not just the Comeback Kid, the Houdini who had survived a thousand scrapes. He was also the empath-in-chief, and now he got the return on his investment: the American people empathised back. </p> <p>They had already forgiven or ignored the waves of scandal that had broken with every season of the first term: Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and all the other gates never really swung. The American people apparently felt the same way about the president as a former Arkansas state senator I once interviewed. He had worked with the then governor throughout the 1980s and had little sympathy for him politically. But he was adamant: \"Bill Clinton doesn't give duck crap about money.\" Americans could see that for themselves: they had a president who had never owned his own house (he had lived in the Arkansas governor's mansion since he was 32, moving from there directly to the White House). He may have been a shameless hustler after votes, but few voters believed Clinton was ever in the business of lining his own pockets. That's why all the stuff about Whitewater never stuck. </p> <p>Zippergate was different: Clinton may not have lusted after cash, but Americans knew he lusted after flesh. They knew, too, that he had an indisciplined, selfish, self-indulgent streak. They knew he could be reckless and self-destructive, taking a risk he must have known could have ended his presidency. </p> <p>But here's where empathy became a two-way street. Despite a year-long hammering from the Republicans, and a press united in its disgust for the president's actions, the public stood by him. Americans told pollsters they hated what Clinton had done but, from the first revelations in January 1998 to the senate trial a year later, they remained consistent, approving his performance as president and insisting that he should not be removed from office. </p> <p>They understood him, just as he had understood them. He had always seemed to cut them a little slack, and now they returned the compliment. In the autumn of 1998 they watched the tapes of a beleaguered president assaulted by excruciatingly personal questions from Kenneth Starr's prosecutors - grainy footage with the visual grammar of a hostage video - and they sided with him. Just like Hillary, they stood by their man. </p> <p>Once, when speaking about his faith, Clinton described the God he believed in as \"the God of second chances\" - and he let out a little smile. That was the Clinton of early 1999: a lucky man, blessed with forgiveness. </p> <p>In the end, he was less Houdini than Rasputin. The Republicans tried and tried to kill him, but they failed, destroying themselves in the attempt. Where are his enemies now? Gingrich was forced out of the Speaker's chair after the impeachment debacle, so was his successor. The rest of the president's persecutors in the House are in tight congressional races today, desperate just to hold on to their seats. </p> <p>And as for Clinton, this is his last day in total command. I can look back now on the last eight years and admit that we, those of us who covered him, were spoiled. We saw a president with towering political skills and a serious intellect - a man who could rattle off the fine-print detail of any policy programme anywhere in America and discuss the domestic politics of most countries in the world, a leader who would think nothing of calling up the great academics and writers of the day, often in the small hours, for a late-night, unarranged t\u00e9-te-\u00e0-t\u00e9te. </p> <p>And there was that gift for people. I admit it, it spoiled me - it even skewed my judgment. I came back from America to cover Britain's 1997 election, and was soon whispering to friends my anxiety that Tony Blair's success was far from assured: he got such little enthusiasm from the crowds. I'd got used to winning candidates getting a Clinton-sized response. Now I can see that I had witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon. Like someone who heard Sinatra sing in the 1950s or watched John McEnroe play tennis in the 1980s, I had seen a maestro at the height of his powers. Clinton was the Pele of politics, and we might wait half a century to see his like again. </p> <p>Today America is choosing between two half-Clintons. They can have a version of his smarts, in Al Gore, or a version of his warmth, in George W Bush. Clinton wants the voters to choose Gore, of course, to protect his legacy. But if America picks Bush, that will be a kind of compliment, too. For it will prove that an ability to connect, which Bush has and Gore does not, is now an indispensable part of the job - thanks to Clinton, the king of empathy. </p> <p>Smarts or warmth, one or the other is on offer today. Voters who want both will just have to wait. Or they can take one last look at the man from Hope - and remember.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q:</strong> You appear to leap from genre to genre, do you programme those leaps into the development stage?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Looking for some juicy new genre to attack? It hasn't necessarily been problematic, but I think there's two things that have happened as the years go by. One related to the nerd side of me, which is an engagement with the film's historical record and the traditions, and many of them are Hollywood traditions that Hollywood itself has just forgotten as the fads pile up. I think the engagement with that, those tasks, is very enriching for me personally. For Ang it's a different tack, but it's also quite similar, to rub up against those traditions, to continually test your craft, to treat yourself as a craftsperson as well as an artist. There's a certain luxury associated with that exercise. So I think that the generic imperative is going to continue, we don't necessarily have one that we're dying to do next. Although musicals have been bandied around a bit. . .</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>But we haven't really decided yet.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> That's the beauty of working with James, I think, a film professor. You know, whenever I am tired of doing this one, abundant sources come my way. Swoosh! So writing the script is the least interesting thing to us. It's what film we're going to create, what fun we're going to have, what kind of angle are we going to put on it, what juice are we going to put in. That was the real fun, not genre or script writing - you know, craft, what fun we're going to have. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon seems to be a big leap of faith. What was the danger? The financial risk?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Of course it was a big risk. A lot of stress. It was something I've wanted to do for a long time, but didn't really have the skill until I'd made six films. Then I was ready to take the challenge. I think the biggest challenge I had was doing a genre film that takes a lot of money to make, and on top of that I want to make A-grade drama, and see if I can keep a balance and have both of them benefit each other. On top of that, I want to do a big landscape in China. So all of that is very challenging. To me it is important after three English-language films that I go back to my cultural roots, to fulfill my boyhood dreams. But it also a new adventure, because that kind of film-making is low budget in America but is titanic in China. There are no rules. We get to make the rules. There's no producer to look over my shoulder. There is no set standard. Of course, I keep testing the limit. </p> <p>James will tell you the story of how much each area would give for an Ang Lee film with Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh. Then they would give us a number and we would come up with that budget. James can fill you in. It's a very interesting process, the financial process, and what's at stake. Once the money's raised, we're OK, we're making the movie. But for the investors, the movie has to make $60m to break even. No Chinese film has ever come close to that. It's a kind of mission impossible. But it's what we want to do. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/4.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a>] (1 min 45)</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Well, these were interesting circumstances to go asking for money in Hollywood for Ang for a Chinese-language film. Namely because after the 'blockbuster' success of The Ice Storm and the 'firestorm of praise and heaps of money' that showered upon us after Ride with the Devil. . . Basically, if this film didn't work, Ang would be directing segments for Fox TV's Scariest Animal Moments. . . so there was a little bit of iffyness involved. And the Taiwanese billionaire who pledged to put up all the money, I don't know, maybe it was a bad mahjong day or something. . .</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> It was the Asian economic storm. . .</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> The virus. Anyhow. So we had to pull numbers out of Europe, and particularly a lot of long-standing friends and the distribution community here, who still had faith in Ang, and prove with those numbers that this film could support a budget of X dollars. At that point we brought in Sony Pictures Classics in the States, another Sony - the Columbia Pictures, Asia and then the Sony entity of Columbia Pictures International in order to pick up the other territories, including the Asian territories and Latin America. There was this corporate family who came in to put the pieces together and help us make the film. But at that point it was also a corporate family whose cookie jar was empty. So we had to bank all these contracts, we had to find a bank that was crazy enough to do that, and that was in France. Then we had to get a bond company to insure the movie, because the bank wouldn't give us any money until we had an insurance policy that said we would deliver this wacky movie that was being shot all over China. So they were in Los Angeles. And then we had the Taiwanese production end. But in order to close the deals, for tax reasons (it's a complicated story), they had to set up a subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands. Our limited liability corporation, that we set up in the United States, had the sub-licence to English-language rights. So we ended up with literally thousands of pages of legal documentation, all of which had to be signed in a circular way - one of those things where the guy in Italy isn't going to sign until the guy in France has signed. Meanwhile they were in Beijing already, pre-producing the movie and more or less mortgaging Ang's house. So it was a little iffy.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> All of which could have been put at risk by one or two tiny accidents, like Michelle Yeoh messing up her knee quite early on in the shoot?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Yes, second week of shooting, unfortunately. Doing a spinning flying-kick, something she did thousands of times. But she didn't pay attention and it was at the end of a night's shooting, and 'crack', she snapped her knee ligament and has to be sent away for surgery. For about 2 1/2 months we have to reschedule everything. It was a nightmare. The movie started out shooting in the Gobi desert - it was just a logistical nightmare - sandstorms, lost in the desertand flood. In the desert. Two weeks of rain!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> The locals went up to our producer, Bill Kong, who had been burning incense each day for good luck and getting none of it. They said, 'Thank you so much for burning that incense, because that's what we do when we want rain!'</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> So the whole production was like that. Nothing worked. Every little detail I had to, like, kill myself, kill everybody, just to make it work. The whole production was like that. I thought I was dying sometimes. I don't know how I lived through that. When people ask me about a sequel. . .</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>It's just insane. <br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/5.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> (1 min 37)</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the novel of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon available here?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> We're trying to arrange it. . . well, there was an abridged version of the novel published in Taiwan and they're trying to arrange a translation of that abridged version. Of course, that abridged version was copyright piracy. . . Oh yeah. .. So who knows if they'll cut through that.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are you both fans of the martial arts genre, and if so, which are your favourite directors in the genre?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> I grew up with it. I'm a big fan. When I was younger it's the storytelling that really grabbed me, the fantasy storytelling, about power, about personal transcendence, about romance. Morality tales. A secret joy we had when growing up. As I grew a little older, the Hong Kong choreographers took over the genre and made fantastic fight sequences. Of course, they don't really care what's in between the fights. So that film language really fascinated me as a young film student. So it really fascinated me in both ways. I really wanted to hit the high notes of the Hong Kong action standards, while I have the fantastic movie and the applause and everything else. So that's something I've always wanted to do. </p> <p>Among those directors, King Hu is more of a director to look up to, and Chang Che is one of them. The recent ones, they don't really influence me except some of the really classic fighting sequences - the stories I didn't care for much.</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> I saw a fair amount when we were researching the film. My current favourite is Chang Che, who was working in the 60s and 70s, and if you ever get the chance to score a tape of One-armed Swordsman. . . These are incredibly brutal, queer, kind of sadomasochistic fight movies, with all these greased-up guys chopping each other to bits. They're pretty fun!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I heard you were planning a prequel next year and also is it true that Chow Yun-Fat has declared that he is taking a break from film for the next year and a half?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> If I were Chow and had made this movie with this guy - I wouldn't work again.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Not next year. I couldn't take it anymore. I'm so exhausted. I probably need to make one or two English-language films to recover from it. Physically I can't take it anymore.</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> But don't worry, they'll be 20 other Chinese movies with the title Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - the Prequel, coming out next year. . .</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You portray very interesting female characters in your movies. You don't see that very often in films, so where do you get your ideas from?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> From my wife, I suppose. Seriously. And my ex-girlfriend. Actually I was brought up in a very chauvinist, traditional Chinese male way, but at heart I guess I'm just not a macho guy. I'm not going to be John Woo. Strong women attract me in real life, and in dramatic context. A strong woman, when her heart is broken, it breaks my heart. It's something that speaks for me very well. When there are such characters in the text, I just tend to grab them. I don't know why. It's just chemistry find that I do a much better job with strong female characters than anything else. </p> <p>Somehow in Asia, I notice, women make up 80 per cent of my audience. So you see women with crouching men sitting next to them [pulls the face of a very quiet, small man]maybe at The Wedding Banquet you'll see a couple of guys. </p> <p>I think it is also a refreshing angle to check into repressed male-dominated society. Particularly for this one, which is a very macho genre, it just gives a different angle. There is a deeper emotional depth because we are taking an emotional tour with the heroines. I just like that. It's the best thing I can offer, I suppose. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/6.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> (2 mins 25) </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Could you speak about the fight sequence in the forest at the end of the movie - how long did it take?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> It took two weeks to shoot that scene. Most of it is on the editing floor. . . it was just a crazy idea that I had and everyone refused to do it for months. There is no shortage of swordfighting in bamboo forests, because bamboo provides a very romantic environment. In China, bamboo symbolises righteousness - it shoots straight up, it's elastic, like the swordsmanship. Also it provides a very interesting foreground. But normally no-one ever gets up there because it's undo-able. That's why I wanted to do it.</p> <p>The colour of green is really the Hidden Dragon for me in the movie, against the colour of red in the desert flashback. The crouching one, the forbidden one to me is really green. The Green Destiny, Jade-eyed Fox. Anything green, with a little bit of white, is very sexy and taboo-ish for me. So I thought the bamboo choreographed sequence really, in an abstract way, is mesmerising. It's not really a fight. I thought it was a good place to do it. You know, we live in a place with gravity. I sort of underestimate that. </p> <p>It's very painful for the actors and I worry about their safety. They were down in the bamboo forest in the southern part of China, in the valleys. It's hard to get a big construction crane in there. We managed to get four or five in there and hang the actors up. There's the valley and the creek, so they're really high up there, and we had to build platforms for the tighter shots. Once you cut the bamboo, the leaves dwindle. Only on drizzling days can you shoot for half an hour, then you have to change the bamboo again. It's really painful But it's a crazy idea.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I wasn't really sure about the flashback scenes. Why did you spend so long in the desert when it didn't seem to be crucial to the film? And also, how does scriptwriting work in terms of there having to be a constant translation between English and Chinese?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> I can answer the first question about the flashback: It's a big mistake, we're sorry.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>It was a very big topic for us. In general, every time I see the movie, which is less and less (but he [Ang Lee] sits through it all the time!) I think, 'I can't believe we got away with this!' All of a sudden, for 20 minutes, they go back there. . . and it's completely unapologetic, it's like cut/back, cut/back. We're ready to take it on the chin a bit, hence my feistiness. But there are a lot of reasons why we love the flashback. </p> <p>But I'll tell you a little about the scriptwriting process. It was extremely educational for me, and extremely painful for Ang. We started with a Chinese-language draft, and then Ang made a precis of the parts of the fourth volume that were most important to him. Then I wrote this completely entertaining swash-buckling romantic adventurous epic movie, that was a joke to the Chinese who reading it. I use the analogy that if a Chinese person wrote a John Wayne western, and he rides into town, gets off his horse, walks over to the sheriff, says 'Howdy' and then, like, kow-tows nine times. . .</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>But the structure was there. I think if I was Chinese it would be a nightmare parody of my entire culture. But structurally, I think, it still ended up working. Then Ang and Hui-Ling Huang really took it over and from inside-out really transformed the film, and really got into a lot of the cultural references, indices - the soul, which I had misread. Even though I'd read a lot of Chinese stuff in English translation and seen a lot of movies, I misread almost every cue. So it was great that the process became six months of mutual torture through bad translation . . .can you imagine trying to write your script and have somebody who had been fired from the UN doing bad translation? . . . I always thought we were going to make a movie that was understandable to westerners, but still very Chinese, and I still think essentially it's a Chinese film. But in a way I also recognise that why the film has been so massively successful in Asia is not because it retained its Asian identity, but because of all these wonderful new things that came about in discourse with the west. Especially in regards to the female characters and the romance, which are very foreign to the genre. I think that one of the things I find people responding to here in the west is precisely the fact that you get to see a two-hour Taoist action movie. The Chinese-ness of it, even if it's not always entirely comprehensible because of the subtitles, I think that's what's so profoundly new about it. So in a way we ended up making an eastern movie for western audiences and in some ways a more western movie for eastern audiences. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/7.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a>] (2 mins 27)</p> <p> <strong>AL:</strong> To me, James is the best writer I personally know of. Take this film, it has to hit Asia like a summer blockbuster, but at the same time it has to be in the art-house cinemas and the New York Film Festival. So from the New York Film Festival to Asian blockbuster is a big range to cover. James doesn't know Chinese, but the structure and the film logic and the sellability, marketability and the pure grade of how good the script is. I do need his help, that's just the bottom line. It's painful for me to say so, but Goddamn it, it's so true.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I just have a comment, not a question.

  "<p><strong>NN:</strong> Let's start with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This is based on the fourth of a five-part novel sequence, a sort of Chinese Pulp Fiction. At what stage did you see the possibility of a film within this?</p> <p> <strong>AL:</strong> I read the book through a friend of mine who knew I was a fan of this particular writer in 1994. The fourth volume, which is the story of a young girl, Jen, struck me that there was a movie there. When there is a strong woman character in a story - that always grabs me. Especially in this very macho genre, which since boyhood I've wanted to do. It felt as if it took six movies for me to even begin to earn the right to make this kind of movie. Of course, I'm growing up, I'm an established film-maker, known for making family dramas about personal relationships, I cannot go all the way and make a purely genre film, I've got to throw everything I know into the movie - like a combination platter. The key is to keep the balance. </p> <p>I think the book struck me in a few ways that I thought very interesting to pick it as my first martial arts film. It has a very strong female character and it was very abundant in classic Chinese textures. Usually these pulp fiction books are set aside from the lawful society - they create a world called Giang Hu, which is an entanglement, a relationship with the underworld, with swordsmanship - almost like a fairytale. But this one is not quite that way, it is very abundant in what I care about - and also to do with the process of Chinese history, which has been lost, classic Chinese textures, which I know from history, my parents, from movies. It gives the impression of China which is kind of like the hidden dragon in me, in some ways, and I feel I want to pursue it. </p> <p>At the same time I was offered Sense and Sensibility - I couldn't refuse that job, it was just too good a job - so I made that. Meanwhile, the Ice Storm was still in development, And that was something I really wanted to do, and frankly I don't think I was ready to do a big production like this. Then I did another movie, Ride with the Devil, and then I thought I was ready. Going back after three major league productions, English-language films, including one somewhat action film, Ride with the Devil, I thought I was ready. I was, you know, tougher. And then James can tell you about the scripting process. There's the script and financing. Meanwhile, I went to Beijing and started to do location scouting. It's a process of two years. Five, six months of pre-production, then five months of shooting and five months of post-production and then seven or eight months in promotions.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> The remarkable thing about this being a Chinese production is that there are resonant myths with the west. For example, the Green Destiny sword can be compared to Excalibur in Arthurian legend. And there seem to be bits of Hamlet dotted all over the film. Was this embedded in the text itself, or was it something you drew out in order to make it more universal?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> I think people are universal. I took the name Green Destiny from - well there is such a sword called Green Destiny. It is green because you keep twisting it, it's an ancient skill, you keep twisting it and knocking it and twisting it until it is very elastic and light. Swoosh! It swings like that, you know? </p> <p>Green Destiny is a name which is derived from the book, and I took the name and I go further with the Taoist philosophy. The jade fox - the old green, the murky green that's what the green really means. It is the ultimate yin-ness. Yin and yan where everything exists in and derives from. . . this is hard to explain. The most mysterious feminine factor, the existence that we men, we don't know. It's woman. It's feminine. That's what the sword is about. That's the symbolic meaning of the sword. Even in Chinese you probably don't get that. . . I don't know. But that's for me. Anything green is hidden dragon, desires and repression. . . something weird when you dig into the depth. I think there is something like that in Excalibur, for example. . .</p> <p>We didn't exactly have that in mind for a western audience. For a western audience, I think between James and me, the bouncing passing forth between Chinese and English, I think it is a good exercise to make it reasonable for a worldwide audience - not just a western audience - a worldwide audience and to some degree a modern Chinese audience as well. Things and logic that we used to take for granted in the Orient might not be that logical today. It's a good exam - how to tell a story with a global sense. That means more layout of the texture of society, more explanation of rules of the games. For example, the first fight does not ensue until 15 minutes into the movie. To a Chinese audience it must feel like 30 minutes - 'Are we gonna see a fight or what?' Usually with this genre the first thing that happens is a good fight sequence to show that you're in good hands. So we broke that rule. I think a lot of that comes from the western audience. </p> <p>I also I didn't want to make just a martial arts film, you know, there's drama in it. I think there is somewhat of a western three-act structure that lays things out. Starting with a crisis or an action, things like that, or verbalising a relationship. </p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> James, I know you've worked on all of Ang's scripts, aside from Sense and Sensibility, but you've worked on all of Ang's films. But never anything like this. What sort of a challenge was it for you to tackle the stunt aspect of the script?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> It was an amazing challenge, because in fact I didn't do it. </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>On the first draft of the script I had a little preamble. As you go through the scenes and get to the fight scene, I remember exactly the language I used - 'They fight'. The preamble said, 'While I fail to explain the fight scenes, I can assure you that they will be the greatest fight scenes ever written in cinema history. Period.' And that was our pitch to the distributors we were selling the film to at that time. I knew two things. One was that Ang was going to insist on crafting fight sequences that were not simply the kind of western fight sequences where there's a bad guy who wants to kill the good guy, while the good guy doesn't really want to kill the bad guy - but in the fight the bad guy gets the upper hand, and it looks like the good guy's going to die, but at the last minute the good guy kills the bad guy. Only he doesn't kill the bad guy he just disables him, then the bad guy finally gets out of the tub with the knife and the good guy has to kill him. </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>So I knew that they were going to be expressions of relationships and meaningful. Because in most of the fights in this movie, one person really doesn't want to fight. So it's a really interesting situation, having to make dramatic fight scenes when they are more or less than that. So I knew that Ang, and in particular our martial arts choreographer, Yuen Woo-Ping, would work all this stuff out on set in pre-production. It's one of those great ironies that when we mention Yuen Woo-Ping over here in the west it's always suffixed by 'of The Matrix fame'. Because he did do the choreography for The Matrix, which we loved, but of course we know him as the guy who created Jackie Chan's career and Jet Li's career. And it's amazing to see 30 years later, full circle, the cultures revolving, and so Yuen Woo-Ping returns to us as the guy who did The Matrix.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> As the film was being put together there were reports about the different castings. I gather that Jet Li was in fact considered for the main role and I understand that you were planning two language versions - one in English and one in Mandarin. Is that true?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> That was just a thought. Is it do-able? I don't know. Has anyone done it before? I don't know. It seemed to be a waste of time to shoot two versions. Am I going to direct them with equal intensity? All of the actors had better Chinese than English. Are they going to struggle with their English? Production-wise it doesn't make sense. Unless there were, like, 50 lines in the movie, then maybe I could manage to do that. But there are too many lines in the movie. So I decided not to do that and stick with Mandarin.</p> <p>Yeah, Jet Li, the first thing you think about when doing a martial arts film is him. But at that time it was a much smaller project, I really intended to make the movie as Sense and Sensibility with martial arts [laughs]. . . a two woman story. . . So the men are just generally supporting roles, just a touch, just a vehicle for their romance and conflict. So Jet Li was invited . . . but it didn't work out. . . </p> <p>Anyway, Chow Yun-Fat was the next big movie star. I don't see that as a Jackie Chan part.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>Chow Yun-Fat said he will never play a period piece. Will never shave his head and have a ponytail. He's never held a sword before. But I know he's a good actor, and drop-dead gorgeous and everything, so I show him the script and, at that stage, he is willing to take the job. So I was very moved. So he is not going to do tumbling and all kinds of fantastic Jet Li-styles of fighting, so the fighting gets reduced and his part gets really beefed-up. His relation with Michelle Yeoh really gets beefed up, and the part really becomes a romantic lead. I think, thinking back, we were lucky to have him. The movie is more a romantic drama. </p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> So the fact that you cast him changed the emotional weight of the movie?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Yes. I always do that. Sometimes it happens in the writing, sometimes in the directing. Like Zhang Zi-Yi, the young girl, she didn't turn out to be the way I see the part, so I have to veer the movie towards her and make it work. I think I am the actors' tailor. As far as casting is concerned, until the last moment of the music is composed, the job is not done. The whole process is casting. You have to make them look like they're perfectly cast. </p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> Your last four films have been based on novels. Rick Moody's The Ice Storm, Austen's Sense and Sensibility and Daniel Woodrell's book Woe to Live On and now this. When you have a source material to work from, do you think in a different way when you approach the script? James?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Oh, me?</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> Well, both of you. . . </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> It's running out of things to write about. That's why I adapt. . . </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Well essentially it means I can get away with a first draft just by ripping off somebody else. . . </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>Which is a great comfort. Because that first stage is just going through and underlining all the juicy bits and then trying to run them in some kind of order that makes sense cinematically. Then the hard part actually does take over, and you realise that novels don't simply translate into movies. Assuming that the world the novel created for you is the basis for the enjoyment of the script and the film is a deadly error. Because that world doesn't exist once you're dealing in cinematic terms - you have to create it every step of the way. It's like film production itself. </p> <p>My partner Ted Hope, at Good Machine, who started as an assistant director, the guy who ran the set, used to say it's like a Phillip K Dick novel, if you don't think about the floor, it's not there and you fall through it. And to a certain extent it's the same adapting novels, you suddenly realise you've forgotten what you need to do to make it into a movie. So it's an interesting process, it's a good process for lazy people, because the first stage is so easy, and it's a good process for procrastinators, because you already have a draft before you even start thinking about making a movie.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> Does this mean that we're not going to have any more original Ang Lee scripts?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> There could be an original James Schamus script. . . I don't care about writing really. When I started out, nobody gave me scripts, so I had to write. . . That's why I wrote family drama - I'm a domestic person, it's all I know! Now I'm kind of established as a director, I much prefer directing to writing. Writing's lonely. Directing, I get all kinds of inspiration. It's working with people. It's a lot more fun. When I have a full schedule like that, I don't see myself sitting there for a couple of months, doing the research, going through a painful process, it's just not my thing anymore. I grab the life I have to direct as many movies as I can. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/1.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a>] (58 seconds)</p> <p> <strong>NN:</strong> Let's look at that early stage, about 1985. You were at NYU film school, you had a couple of scripts, you were not being able to get films made. So you sent two scripts into a competition run by the Taiwanese government. These scripts were Pushing Hands, which won the first prize, and The Wedding Banquet, which won second prize. Not a bad way to start! That gave you the impetus to get a film made. Enter Good Machine, James's company. How did that meeting of minds come about?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> When I sent those scripts, that was the lowest point of my life. We'd just had our second son, and when I went to collect them from hospital, I went to the bank to try and get some money to buy some diapers, the screen showed I've got $26 left. Terrible. Anyway, my first Chinese script was The Wedding Banquet, it was written six years before it was made into a film. At that time making a Chinese-language film in America was inconceivable, no-one would give me money, no matter how small it was. And it was gay-related subject matter, so I couldn't raise the money in Taiwan either, so it just sat there. </p> <p>Then at the end of 1989 a friend of mine saw an advert that that year they were expanding the script competition to off-sea Chinese. The top award was equivalent to $16,000 - good money. I had this idea of Pushing Hands and the old Tai-Chi master for a long time but I never wanted to write it. I felt like in that six years I was sitting there like an old Tai-Chi master at home, going nowhere.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>I never meant to make that movie, but I know that if I write that movie I can win the top prize from the Taiwanese government. So I wrote it for the sake of the competition. So I won it, and they sent me a ticket to receive the prize in Taiwan. So when I arrive they say, the studio, that they want to make three movies. It's related to the government, called Central Motion Pictures, and it had just changed management. They say they want to make three movies, one is going to be done by a new director, we know we're going to lose money so just do what you want.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>'The American wife in that part? Just don't choose anyone too ugly.'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>A third of the budget was funded by the government, a third is a video package deal they had, so there's only equivalent to $100,000 investment, so they said go ahead and do it. The story was set in New York, and I took the money, but I said, 'Give me a couple of days, I dunno if I want to do it.' I'd been waiting 10 years. . . I didn't want to make a flop. Anyway, I took the money and I was looking for a line producer, and through a friend of mine I knew Ted. And then there was Ted and James at the new-found Good Machine. They shared two tables with another company, I think. So I did my pitch. And they did their pitch. They told me that they were the kings of no-budget film-making in New York.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>James looked like a used-car salesman and a professor. . . And they said, 'Pay attention. We said 'no-budget' not 'low-budget'. Your money, about $400,000. . . </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> 350</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> '$350,000 is luxury for us.' They offered something very tempting to me. They said they were director-centered producers. They wanted to teach the directors how to make the movies that they can afford instead of spending time in development hell - and I'd just spent six years in there. . . so I know how that tastes. And over the years I'm just glad that these two guys, I'm just glad they're not crooks!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>And they did keep their promise. They did grow together with me and they still teach me how to make the movie I can afford. All the movies you see - small ones, bigger ones. . . they fumble along the way like I do. They're learning how to deal with bigger people and different situations, international money-raising and sales. The first movie, Pushing Hands, didn't make any money except in Taiwan, so James said, 'Let me help you with the script for the second one.' And that hit. The Wedding Banquet was international, and we were capable of doing one after another, Chinese, English. . . It is a very fruitful and nurturing relationship that we get to grow together. I now want them to teach me how to make Terminator 3. . . </p> <p> <strong>Sound clips</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/1.ra\">'I don't care about writing really.

Two more were arrested \"in and around\" the river Thames, where the robbers had a powerboat waiting to speed them from the scene, Scotland Yard said, and armed police in Kent detained five more men.</p> <p>In scenes reminiscent of the James Bond film The World is Not Enough, the raiders used a bulldozer to break into the dome.</p> <p>But officers from Scotland Yard's elite Flying Squad knew in advance about the raid and were lying in wait.</p> <p>Scotland Yard said that the robbers used the earth digger to crash through the gates of the dome and enter the money zone where the diamonds were located.</p> <p>Police said that the intelligence-led operation had been planned for several months and involved more than 100 officers.</p> <p>Detective Superintendent Jon Shatford, who led the Flying Squad operation, said: \"If this had been carried out in accordance with their wishes, this would have been the largest robbery in the world.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for De Beers's London office confirmed there had been an attempt to steal the Millennium Star and a collection of 12 blue diamonds, the Millennium Jewels, which are also on show.</p> <p>Kate Evan-Jones refused to discuss security measures for the gems at the dome, including whether they are left in the money zone overnight or removed for safety.</p> <p>The Millennium Star is \"priceless\" because it is a flawless, pear-shaped 203-carat gem, said Ms Evan-Jones.</p> <p>\"It is impossible to put a value on it because of its rarity and uniqueness.\"</p> <p>The Millennium Star played a central role in the opening ceremony for the dome on New Year's Eve. At ten minutes to midnight laser beams were directed at the gem which filled the dome with sparkling shafts of light.</p> <p>Police officers arrived at the site in Greenwich, south-east London, at around 9am today. The dome, which would normally have opened at 10am, was closed to the general public, but most of the site was reopened late in the morning.</p> <p><b>Related story</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/dome/article/0,2763,394044,00.html\">Timeline: how the heist was foiled</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/dome/article/0,2763,394084,00.html\">Background: Britain's biggest robberies</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.dome2000.co.uk/static/flash/\" target=\"_new\">The Millenium Experience</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.debeers.ca/\" target=\"_new\">De Beers</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.adiamondisforever.com//\" target=\"_new\">Diamond Information Centre</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.britannia.com/tours/dome/\" target=\"_new\">Tour of the Dome</a></p>",
  "Flying Squad officers took months to plan today's operation but just minutes to foil the daring diamond heist. <p>\u0095 The display of the world's finest diamonds, including the priceless 203-carat De Beers Millennium Star, arrived at the dome on December 31 1999, in time to appear as one of the centrepieces of the opening night celebrations. </p> <p>\u0095 Police said today's intelligence-led operation was several months in planning and involved more than 100 officers including members of the Metropolitan Police's elite flying squad. </p> <p>\u0095 The chairman of the New Millennium Experience company, David James, said police had alerted him of the \"possibility of an attack\" five weeks ago. Officers had already alerted the NMEC chief executive, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, who was cooperating with security plans. </p> <p>\u0095 There were approximately 24 \"risk days\" when the attack could have taken place, Mr James said. </p> <p>\u0095 De Beers switched the \u00a3350m diamonds with crystal replicas last night after being warned by police that a raid was imminent. </p> <p>\u0095 At 9am today the dome opened for business as usual - but with armed undercover officers, some dressed as cleaners, mingling with the unsuspecting general public and up to 200 staff on duty. </p> <p>\u0095 The area was surrounded by armed officers who were lying in wait backed by air support and police river launches. </p> <p>\u0095 The robbers \"were totally surrounded\" and officers were ready to act if there was any threat to the public, said Detective Superintendent Jon Shatford. </p> <p>\u0095 London Underground shut North Greenwich station, which serves the dome, after receiving an call from the Met saying a security alert at the Dome would necessitate its immediate closure. London Ambulance was also put on standby. </p> <p>\u0095 Just after 9.30am, raiders used a bulldozer to break into the dome and flying squad officers began the swoop which led to six arrests. </p> <p>\u0095 Four of those arrested were allowed to enter the Money Zone vault where they backed themselves into a dead end, encircled by officers and were arrested at gunpoint. </p> <p>\u0095 Two further arrests were made \"in and around\" the Thames, where the robbers had a powerboat waiting at the Millennium Pier to speed them from the scene, Scotland Yard said. </p> <p>\u0095 By mid-morning, armed officers from Kent police's serious crime squad arrested a further five men in two raids in the villages of Collier Street, near Yalding, and Horsmonden, west Kent, as part of a joint operation with the Met. </p> <p><b>Related story</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/dome/article/0,2763,393971,00.html\">Police foil dome diamond raid</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/dome/article/0,2763,394084,00.html\">Background: Britain's biggest robberies</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.dome2000.co.uk/static/flash/\" target=\"_new\">The Millennium Experience</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.debeers.ca/\" target=\"_new\">De Beers</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.adiamondisforever.com//\" target=\"_new\">Diamond information centre</a> <br><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1010000/1010992.stm\">BBC: the dome's diamond attraction</a><br><a href=\"http://www.britannia.com/tours/dome/\" target=\"_new\">Tour of the dome</a></p>",
  "<p>In breaktime at Abraham Moss High school in Greater Manchester last Friday, staff threw a party to celebrate the resignation of Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools. Copies of the Guardian's front page, \"Woodhead sent packing\", were neatly cut out and stuck up on the staffroom walls. Staff were whispering, \"fantastic, fantastic\" while pouring cups of tea. </p> <p>\"They've eaten 15 packets of my best biscuits and 8lbs of bananas and satsumas,\" said the head teacher, David Watchorn, who provided the food in the 20 minute break between lessons. Woodhead's bespectacled face looked down helplessly from the broadsheets stuck on the noticeboards while teachers clutching chocolate crunch creams laughed and said they wouldn't mind aiming spit at him. </p> <p>In a new version of the John F Kennedy/death of Diana moment, everyone could remember where they were when they heard the news. </p> <p>\"I was on my way home from school,\" said Madeleine Brierley, who teaches English. \"I had left late on be half of 120 pupils I had taken to the theatre. I was going to be late home because of all the work I had put into the trip. And I was delighted that while I had been working so hard, Woodhead, who had criticised teachers so heavily, had left. The other day, I was writing about inspections and my spell check rejected the word Ofsted, suggesting 'ousted'. Quite ironic really.\" </p> <p>Lynne Wilson, head of design technology, was up late, preparing work linked to inspections, when she heard about Woodhead's resignation. \"Sometimes I'll work until 1am, trying to do everything as well as possible because of Ofsted. I'm always thinking, 'prepare well, you never know what they'll pick up on'. When the news came on TV, my daughter brought me a cup of tea, and I smiled for the first time that day.\" </p> <p>Julie Rudge, a trainee teacher, spoke as a parent and a former parent governor. She said, \"When I heard the news on the radio, I responded as a parent first, trainee teacher second. As a mother, I recognise that his influence was not all negative. It is probably a good thing that schools have become more accountable, because as a parent, you obviously want the best for your child.\" </p> <p>But at the inner city comprehensive with over 1,000 pupils - 65% from ethnic minorities, and some who are refugees who have difficulties with English - elation among the 70 staff soon evaporated with the prospect of who would fill Woodhead's shoes and what would become of Ofsted. </p> <p>Assistant head teacher Pam Thompson, heard the news on the radio while she was driving home after a long, stressful day. \"I get into school at 7am and I'm not the first. Often I don't leave until 6pm and I'm not the last to go. The last time Ofsted inspected, the inspectors were in my class for 17 minutes. They made a judgement on me in just over a quarter of an hour. It wasn't all celebration at the thought of Woodhead leaving. I'm annoyed we have to wait until February for him to go. And there is a very strong chance we could end up with someone even worse.\" </p> <p>She said the \"Woodhead effect\" of moral-crushing criticism of teachers would last for a long time, and the only way to change Ofsted was to replace Woodhead with someone who had a concept of what teachers at the sharp end faced in schools. </p> <p>\"We encourage kids to work and succeed. We don't have a philosophy of punishing failing pupils. Teachers should have a leader for standards who is interested in what we deliver, not just criticism. I would like to see someone highlighting the positive,\" she said. </p> <p>Over the bakewell biscuits, a cluster of teachers said they would have preferred to have seen Woodhead sacked than resign. \"I would rather have seen his head on a plate,\" said one. \"There's a guillotine in my office, but I don't suppose his head would fit in it,\" said another. </p> <p> On the other side of Manchester, at Stamford High School, the staffroom made do without streamers and balloons but teachers said they would never forget the day they turned on the Today programme at 6am, while scrabbling in the dark to find their clothes, and heard that the most criticised member of the education establishment was leaving. </p> <p>Head teacher Phil Taylor cited Woodhead's continual comments on matters like standards in A-levels as an example of years of throwaway public comments that have undermined confidence in teachers and schools. </p> <p>\"This is why he will make a good columnist. It's clear that he will feel at home in a world of people who don't analyse, just shout their mouths off, as that is what he likes doing,\" Taylor said. </p> <p>Taylor speaks from the experience of a head who has worked in several different comprehensives and observed procedures at a school in \"special measures\". </p> <p>\"Students felt that the constant monitoring was harming them. They sensed that the teachers were always on display, and that they were not getting their real personalities, but a show. Staff were leaving because they were fed up with the pressure and students become very sensitive to that.\" </p> <p>Stewart Hankinson, head of music, who has taught for 20 years, said he was surprised to learn of Woodhead's resignation while flicking through Teletext. </p> <p>\"He put the teaching profession under a great deal of stress. I don't mind change, and I'm sure a lot of teachers think change is a good thing, but being faced with new initiatives all the time is difficult at ground level. I feel the next step for Ofsted must be a period of calm and reflection, to take stock of the whole inspection process.\" </p> <p>Many felt Woodhead should have gone earlier, especially when it was alleged that he had had an affair with a pupil while she was still at school. </p> <p>Peggy Saul, head of humanities said the government would have to review its education policy in the light of mixed messages teachers had been sent by Ofsted. She said on one hand, Tony Blair wanted to encourage applications to the profession, and on the other Woodhead had called for 15,000 failing teachers to quit. </p> <p>Saul, who has taught humanities to 11- to 18-year-olds in several schools, was on the way to an evening class in history when she heard of Woodhead's departure. </p> <p>\"I was heading to an evening class to improve my knowledge of my subject and to teach better. </p> <p>\"The government now has to start helping us regain the respect of students and parents that we lost during the Chris Woodhead years. All this criticism has altered perspectives to teachers and made our jobs much harder. Students are not brought up to respect teachers as they were in the past and that can make classes of adolescents hard to control, because they know how we are viewed. Woodhead is going but Ofsted still has a lot to answer for.\" </p> <p><strong>Don't leave me this way...</strong></p> <p>Judy Jones, assistant head at Cliffe Hill primary school in Halifax, is one of the few teachers we asked who said Thursday was a sad day. She had been settling down to watch Hope and Glory on the television when she heard the newsflash. \"I thought, they have finally got their way. They've got him out. I was very disappointed.\" Having met Woodhead, she felt he was \"a man who has his head screwed on right\". </p> <p>\"He is not an unapproachable person. He visited the school and the staff found him very pleasant. Generally, they are sad he is going, but we know it's politics.\" </p> <p>Jean Heslop, head of Cliffe Hill school and Mixenden school, also in Halifax, was at home by the time she heard the news. \"I felt sad, because I doubt whether he will get the accolade he deserves for bringing about development in schools.\" </p> <p>Heslop met Woodhead about four years ago when she contacted him in protest at his calls for 15,000 ineffective teachers to quit. She told him to come up to Halifax and experience life at the front line. He did, and they struck up a good professional relationship. Woodhead visited Cliffe Hill four weeks ago to open a new computer centre paid for with prize money from a national teaching award. </p> <p>\"Chris had an unenviable job,\" says Heslop. \"But on reflection he made a great number of improvements. Ofsted got a lot of things right, and positive things came out of Chris's methods of inspection. Schools and teachers have become more accountable.\" </p> <p>Heslop said she would like to see improvements at Ofsted after Woodhead's departure. National test results should reflect the involvement of the school and there should be more contextual evidence included in Ofsted reports. She said the expertise of Ofsted inspectors needed to be credible and matched to individual schools.</p>",

  "The polling stations have opened on the east coast of the US for today's presidential election that is still too close to call after the tightest race in 40 years. <p>Exhausted by the effort, the candidates, Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W Bush, have now surrendered their fate to the voters. </p> <p>Mr Bush, the governor of Texas and son of former president George Bush, is topping most of the polls, but the outcome is uncertain.</p> <p>Mr Gore, who has been the US vice-president for eight years, put in a final push of campaigning in Florida, a key state to win.</p> <p>The earliest results are already in from the two New Hampshire towns where votes are traditionally first posted. </p> <p>In Dixville Notch, the result was Bush, 21, Gore 5, and the green candidate, Ralph Nader, 1. In nearby Hart's Location, it was Bush 17 and Gore 13, with one vote for a write-in candidate. </p> <p>\"It's not close here, but I believe it will be close in New Hampshire and across the country,\" said Stephen Barba, a Dixville Notch voter. </p> <p>Mr Bush will cast his ballot in Austin, Texas, and has been making calls to west coast radio stations to urge voters to turn out. He also was calling voters in Michigan, Oregon, Florida, Iowa and Wisconsin. </p> <p>After his pre-dawn campaigning in Florida, Mr Gore was voting in Carthage, Tennessee. </p> <p>Voters were choosing between Mr Bush's promise to be a \"uniter not a divider\" and Mr Gore's assertion that he alone has the experience to \"fight for you and win.\" A new Congress was also being decided at the polls. </p> <p>Before that election day ritual in New Hampshire, the candidates had barnstormed the country one last time. </p> <p>Mr Bush hit four states - Tennessee, Wisconsin, Iowa and Arkansas - that voted for Bill Clinton and Mr Gore in 1992 and 1996, but which polls suggest could go Republican. </p> <p>\"If people do what I think they're going to do, you're looking at the next president of the United States,\" the Texas governor told an audience of several hundred supporters after returning to Austin.</p> <p>For his part, Mr Gore engaged in a marathon 30-hour campaigning flurry through crucial Iowa, Missouri, Michigan and Florida. In Florida, he said that the crowd of tens of thousands who greeted him in Miami's fashionable South Beach left him with \"no doubt whatsoever\" he'd finish the day as president-elect. </p> <p>\"Americans are coming together and making a very powerful decision that we are not going to allow ourselves to go back to the policies of the past,\" Mr Gore told the crowd. \"We're going forward with the policies of the future - a bright future that includes all Americans.\" </p> <p>A cast of stars - Glenn Close, Robert De Niro, Stevie Wonder, Billy Dee Williams, Ben Affleck - were there to boost his final campaigning. </p> <p>From Miami, Mr Gore headed to a decidedly more sombre event, holding a pre-dawn meeting with nurses at a Tampa cancer centre, where he sat around a table and talked health care. </p> <p>Mr Gore also was rallying workers on their way to \"get out the vote\" before heading home to cast his own vote at a small school in Carthage. </p> <p>Behind Mr Gore and Mr Bush was the most expensive election in history - $3bn (\u00a32bn) on presidential and congressional races, about $30 for every vote cast - but one that failed to stir much excitement. </p> <p>President Bill Clinton predicted that Mr Gore will emerge victorious on the strength of the economy and a hoped-for large turnout among black people, Latin Americans, immigrants and the working poor. </p> <p>\"He's run a good campaign on his own,\" Mr Clinton said, before taking off from Washington bound for his new home in Chappaqua, New York, where he planned to vote. \"Especially the last couple of weeks, I think he's really been in gear and you also see a lot of our people getting energised. I think he'll win.\" </p> <p>In addition to replacing Mr Clinton, the people were deciding control of the house of representatives and senate, both narrowly held by Republicans. </p> <p>Voters were picking all 435 members of the House, 34 senators and 11 governors and members of state legislatures.</p> <p>For the first time in history, a president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is seeking election to the Senate. She faced Republican Rick Lazio in New York, nominated when prostate cancer caused the mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, to abandon plans to run. </p> <p>With peace and prosperity both at hand and not big issues, the fight was chiefly over how to divide the spoils of prosperity. Mr Bush proposes tax cuts and Mr Gore favours shoring up federal pensions, health care and education.</p> <p><br><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/\">Comment: Liberals torn over Nader</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/columnists/\">Columnists: Missing Bill already</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393871,00.html\"> Election day</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/graphic/0,5543,393512,00.html\">Map</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393605,00.html\">What the US papers say</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393898,00.html\"> Explained: How the US chooses its president</a><br><a href=\"  http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7931a\">Talk about it</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,376827,00.html\">Who would you vote for?</a><br><br><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Official site: Al Gore 2000</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bush2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Official site: George W Bush 2000</a><br><a href=\"http://www.votenader.com/\" target=\"_new\">Official site: Ralph Nader 2000 <br></a><a href=\"http://www.fearthis.com/\" target=\"_new\">Site of the day - fearthis.com</a></p>",
  "There are two universal threads running through the mass of election coverage: the frantic, frenzied nature of the campaign's final 24 hours, and the utter impossibility of predicting the outcome. <p>As the campaign dust finally settles and Americans set about choosing their new leaders, some of the papers are casting around for entertaining sidebar stories.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Los Angeles Times</a>, for example, is already looking ahead to how ex-president Clinton will be filling his time.

From the start of his run through mid-October, the Texas governor had spent $138 million, including $56 million on radio and TV ads, according to the Campaign Study Group.</p> <p>\"Gore was at $94 million overall, including $41.5 million for broadcast ads.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.herald.com/\" target=\"_new\">Miami Herald</a> looks at another modern campaigning tool: the pre-recorded telephone message.</p> <p>\"Tens of thousands of such messages, recorded by candidates and their celebrity supporters, have hit answering machines across the nation.</p> <p>\"Some voters, like Jason Cottrell, are unimpressed: 'If I got a call from a real person, I would talk to them,' said Cottrell, who also received recordings from gun control advocate Sarah Brady for Gore and former presidential candidate John McCain for Bush.

My answering machine is sort of personal'.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.wvgazette.com/\" target=\"_new\">Charleston Gazette</a>, in the 'swing' state of West Virginia, urges its readers to use their votes, and has no doubt where they should go: \"A vote for vice president Al Gore may actually make a real difference in this tight election.</p> <p>\"Gore will need every popular vote and every electoral vote he can win in his battle against Texas Gov George W Bush. A Gore victory would mean a lot for West Virginians.</p> <p>\"Gore will keep the nation headed on the right track, continuing the unprecedented prosperity the United States has enjoyed for the last eight years.\"</p> <p>The paper runs through its endorsements in the other elections, and finally exhorts: \"As soon as you finish reading this newspaper, go vote.

This is a factor often seen as a major contributor towards non-PC users' despair at internet browsing, particularly when their first reaction is to pick up a mouse and use it like a TV remote control. </p> <p>The Freeserve innovation was a welcome ray of sunshine for a company that has had a difficult time in recent months.</p> <p>The market gave an immediate thumbs-up to the announcement with shares rising. </p> <p>Buttons on the mouse mat connect users direct to their pre-set favourite websites. But perhaps one of the crucial elements of First Click is that it contains a smart card for secure e-commerce transactions. For new users going online this Christmas, this should go some way to easing shopping concerns. </p> <p>The announcement that Dixons is selling First Click mouse mats exclusively through Dixons Group stores should not come as a surprise to anyone. But at \u00a329.99 per mat, is Dixons going to make a killing in the stocking filler sector this year?</p> <p>John Pluthero, chief executive officer of Freeserve, said: \"By simplifying access and use of the internet and all the e-commerce sites it has to offer, our proprietary First Click device will drive to the Freeserve portals those users who are inhibited by technology and who might not otherwise contemplate shopping online.</p> <p>\"First Click is another exclusive advantage for Freeserve customers to enjoy, and further demonstrates how Freeserve is colonising internet use in the UK.\"</p>",
  "<p>Arsenal's new 60,000 seater stadium could be vetoed by London mayor Ken Livingstone because of fierce opposition from local residents.</p> <p>Earlier today, Arsenal executives unveiled blueprints for a \u00a3100m new stadium and leisure complex at Ashburton Grove, to be built by the 2003-2004 season. But if local residents get their way the stadium won't be built at all.</p> <p>Despite Arsenal claiming to have the full support of Islington council, it is Livingstone - in his role of mayor - who has the final say over whether the plans will go ahead - and angry Islington residents have urged him to block the club's plans. </p> <p>\"This is not a local issue for a local council to decide and it is not just about football, said Alison Carmichael, press officer for the Islington Stadium Communities Alliance (ISCA) which represents 12 local groups.</p> <p>\"A stadium of this size would be the biggest built in such a densely populated area, anywhere in Western Europe. Only 5% of Arsenal fans at the recent home games against Liverpool and Charlton games actually live in Islington - half came from outside the M25. </p> <p>\"And with 60,000 fans coming and going from a huge multi-use stadium, with all the attendant policing, and disruption that will mean, will be too much for the narrow residential streets found in this part of North Islington,\" she added.</p> <p>\"If you look at other major stadium developments in recent years, like in Milan or, more to the point, Sydney, you will find that they are always well away from residential areas like ours,\" she continued. \"We are prepared to take this all the way. We want Ken Livingstone to decide on this. It is an issue for the whole of London.\"</p> <p>Greater London Authority spokesman Sean O'Curneen, admitted that by law the matter would have to be put to London's mayor, and added that Mr Livingstone would have the power to veto the decision should Islington council choose to accept the planning permission.</p> <p>\"For a proposal this size the mayor must be consulted and, should he deem the plans unacceptable he will be able to prevent the move from going ahead,\" he said.</p> <p>But Arsenal are still hoping the new stadium will be approved. They argue that the move will ensure their survival among the elite in European football - and also claim that it will transform a run-down part of London.</p> <p>Club director Ken Friar said: \"Our proposals will act as a catalyst for the regeneration of the wider area by safeguarding and creating 3,500 jobs, providing over 1,000 new homes and injecting over \u00a3400m of investment into the area.\"</p> <p>\"For over 20 years the Lough Road area has been a blot on the Islington landscape. These proposals will provide substantial public benefit and, unlike previous failed schemes, can be delivered.\"</p>",
  "<p>Playing the lead in a comedy is not where you'd expect to find <a href=\"/Film/Player/Player_Page/0,4159,45424,00.html\">Linus Roache</a>. Acclaimed for his riveting performance as the tortured Father Greg in 1994's Priest, and as the flawed journalist-gigolo in Iain Softley's adaptation of The Wings of the Dove, the 36-year-old actor is associated more with the intense and brooding shades of the acting spectrum than the lighter, comic ones.</p> <p>Yet, he tells me one wet afternoon in a dark Leicester Square bar, what attracted him to the lead role in Siam Sunset was its humour. \"I really wanted to do a comedy, but a lot of the comedies I'd seen or read were formulaic. Siam Sunset felt so off-the-wall and different and fresh and new, and had so many different qualities to it. It also had real drama, and an element of magic and mystery.\"</p> <p>Siam Sunset is indeed far from formulaic. Part road movie, part romance, part thriller, part farce: it's a truly black comedy that explores what happens to a man after his wife dies in a bizarre accident - the kind of bizarre accident that you think is only an urban myth. </p> <p>Perry (Roache), an industrial chemist who creates colours, believes that someone has \"got it in\" for him. After a lorry crashes through his living room, he decides to get away from it all, and heads for Australia on a touring holiday won at a bingo game. But his troubles are far from over. He finds himself on an antiquated coach with a variety of misfits led by driver Bill. Also along for the ride is Grace (Danielle Cormack), on the run from her drug-dealing boyfriend. The Siam Sunset of the title is 'the colour of peace' that Perry hopes to create. Phew. </p> <p>\"I hadn't done a film that actually gives people joy and fun. It's great to be in cinemas and watch people respond,\" explains Roache. \"...it was great fun and it surprised me as well what happens at the beginning still makes me laugh now.\" He adds that he's been instructed not to reveal quite how his unfortunate 'wife' meets her end. </p> <p>Passing unnoticed in the throng of Leicester Square, Roache is a slight figure, who is casually dressed and friendly and relaxed. He looks far too good for someone who's getting over jetlag and a non-stop seven month run of stage performances. He's just returned from Tokyo where he has been touring in productions of Richard II and Coriolanus, acting opposite Ralph Fiennes. He's in town today for the London Film Festival screening of Pandaemonium, in which he plays the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. </p> <p>However, Siam Sunset is uppermost on his mind. Made over two years ago, and premiered at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, Siam Sunset was Australian actor John Polson's directorial debut, but it has been sitting on the distributor's shelf for some time now. Roache acknowledges that it's a difficult film to sell: \"It's a challenge because it's not clearly this kind of movie or that kind of movie, it's a road movie, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce, it's all these things. Maybe it's very ambitious in that way, it does make it hard to find your audience, but I think there's something in there for everybody.\"</p> <p>I ask him about the filming. With the final third of the movie set in the desolate desert of the Australian outback amid extreme heat, it must have been a gruelling shoot. </p> <p>Not really, he tells me. He remembers the experience fondly. \"We were having a great time. We were a bunch of actors who really got on well with a director who's the kind of guy who makes you want to work for him, with a real sense of fun. It's an old metaphor, but it's a true one and it works: this guy ends up in the middle of nowhere with nothing, and there he finds peace. I liked that, and it's kind of true - you're in the desert and there's just the ground and the sky.\" </p> <p>With roles extending from an accident-prone industrial chemist to one of England's greatest romantic poets, and then on to Shakespeare on stage, Roache - unlike his famous father Bill (who, as Coronation Street's Ken Barlow, is the world's longest-serving soap opera actor) - seems determined not to be defined by any one period or role. How does he choose his projects? \"Sometimes out of reaction to what you've just done. If you've just done Wings of the Dove, you don't want to go near the next Merchant-Ivory, but quite often you do get asked to do the same sort of thing immediately again. So I did Shot through the Heart [in which he played a Croatian soldier] after Wings of the Dove, which couldn't be more different. And then Siam Sunset came along.</p> <p>\"I don't have a game plan, a strategy. You just smell your way around. I'm not in a position to just have the pick of the crop, but I am lucky enough to be able to take my time and choose a good job ...something I connect with. Basically I look for a good story.\" </p> <p>Three years ago, critics were salivating over his performance in the Henry James adaptation Wings of the Dove, and Hollywood was calling. His breakthrough role in Antonia Bird's Priest in 1994 also led to acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic. So why has he not headed west? Does he envy the international success of his long-time acting associate Ralph Fiennes? \"A few years ago I would have said yes,\" he confesses, but he's not so sure now. \"Ralph is extraordinary. I really admire him - we've just spent seven months working together. But as well as carrying it all off, he's got all the responsibilities of a leading star - the publicist, the PA, the lawyers, he's got the whole machine and I don't want all that. I want to make films, I want to do bits of theatre, and do the things that I want to do... It's a lot to handle. I just want to enjoy my freedom and be able to be creative and do more movies. I'd like more choice - I'd like more power in that way, but I don't want to have to deal with all that.\"</p> <p>But, he does admit that he would love to work in America, should the right thing came along, whatever that may be. \"It's not necessarily an art film,\" he says. \"I love a lot of mainstream movies. I love The Matrix - a genius, brilliant film. I'd love to be part of something big like that. I'd love to work with an American crew and experience a real Hollywood blockbuster. Not having to worry about using up too much film stock and doing too many takes.\"</p> <p>Which was a problem he had to contend with on the Julien Temple project. \"Pandaemonium was pandemonium,\" he laughs. Filming began straight after Siam Sunset, and \"it was great to go and do something with such a different energy... [Coleridge] is such an extrovert, outwards character, and a lot of the characters I play are introspected, so that was a great shift.\"</p> <p>I wonder whether Temple had a personal vendetta against Wordsworth, who is portrayed as a mean-spirited pedant who'd be more fitted to writing parking tickets than soaringly beautiful poetry. \"Yes, Coleridge comes out very well,\" agrees Roache. \"I think that was Julien's aim - to redress things. He feels that Wordsworth has been given all this respect for not much, and that, really, Coleridge was the genius.\" I suspect that Wordsworth fans will be up in arms, while Roache's involving performance as the opium-addicted Coleridge will do wonders towards rejuvenating his appeal, even if Temple's story bears little relation to reality. </p> <p>Having worked across film, theatre and TV, is Roache one of those actors who claim they only really feel 'alive' on stage? Not so, apparently. \"I prefer film, definitely. I like the concentration, the whole atmosphere round the film set, that you're constantly in a state of rehearsal.\" He compares it to theatre where \"every night you have to go the whole nine yards and deliver. But in film, you've got your big scene, and you know it's coming up, and you work towards it, and you work it on that day, and then it's done. There's a certain freedom in that.\"</p> <p>But don't most actors claim the opposite, complaining of a lack of freedom and control on the film set? \"Yes, it can be frustrating, and I understand completely why actors end up directing and producing, because you are at the mercy of the editor and the director. But I don't have a burning desire to have that kind of power, and I'm quite happy to put myself in the hands of other people. I've been lucky - I've been in good hands, and most of the time I've been enhanced, not reduced by their work.\"</p> <p>Roache's disinterest in the 'glamorous' side of the film industry is well documented. After the release of Priest, he ducked out of the limelight to take an 18-month trip through India. When asked how he feels about the flipside of his fame, he counters with, \"What do you mean by glamour? What is glamorous about it? If there's glamour there I haven't seen it. Sure, sometimes you get treated very well and stay in nice places, but that's not really glamour.\" </p> <p>But surely he feels something about the fact that his chiselled good looks are used to sell movies? \"Is it inevitable to be a pin-up?\" he muses. \"How can you say no to that side of it? It's just the way it is. It's neither good nor bad. I don't court it. I just do that job.\" He tells me of his recent trip to Tokyo. \"[Ralph and I] turned into pop stars. But it's not real. It's some worship thing that's projected onto you. It takes a lot to stay sane in the middle of it all... I'm not going to push it all away, but at the same time I'm not going to start feeding on it or adding to it. It just is what it is.\"</p> <p>Roache credits much of his sanity to the spiritual organisation known as FACE (Friends of Andrew Cohen Everywhere) with which he became involved on his Indian pilgrimage. The group teaches spiritual enlightenment and independence through self-enquiry, and Roache is more than happy to talk about it: \"Andrew Cohen is a big part of my life - the foundation of my life.\" </p> <p>Does he worry about seeing himself and his beliefs ridiculed, as has happened in the past, with the organisation demonised as a cult, and Cohen vilified as a dangerous megalomaniac? \"Well, people can read the magazine (What is Enlightenment) and find out for themselves,\" he says. \"There's a lot of cynicism in the world today, but I can't let that stop me. What's wrong with investigating the nature of reality and truth in an unbiased and unprejudiced way?\" </p> <p>As far as his acting's concerned, Roache reckons his beliefs have made him \"more relaxed, much less needy.\" Not that he's pretending it's solved all his problems: \"I'm not totally free from all paranoias of acting, but I have a much saner relation with it. </p> <p>\"It's like a wheel - you can go on forever. I'd done film, I'd done TV, I'd done the West End, I'd done the RSC, and it's like: well, ok, what's next? A BIG movie. What's next? Another B-I-I-I-I-G movie. An Oscar! Ten! I thought, 'I don't want that'. So I took the time out to travel and look at things from a different perspective. A lot of people thought I was insane. But you follow your instincts.\"</p> <p>Roache strikes me as someone who is incapable of doing anything but follow his instincts. Thinking back to Siam Sunset, he laughs as he remembers that despite his intention to do comedy, he found himself again playing the tragic figure.</p> <p>\"I was so excited to be in a comedy that I started goofing around. The first few days I was throwing a few comic looks and so on, and looking at the rushes, John said, 'I want you to be the tragic figure, the straight man, walking through all this. Let everybody else do the comedy, and let the situation be funny.' And that was quite a renunciation for me because I was wanting to be a little bit goofy as well.\"</p> <p>I like the idea of him being a little bit goofy. Maybe the opportunity will present itself. But whatever happens, I feel sure that as long as Linus Roache the man follows those instincts, Linus Roache the actor will continue to be taken seriously.</p> <p>\u0095 Tickets for Thursday's charity premiere of Siam Sunset are available on 020-7419 8109. Siam Sunset is released on November 10. Pandaemonium will be released early next year.</p>",

  "<p><strong> By Jeff Randall, Sunday Business, May 21 2000</strong>.</p> <p>I was intrigued by the fuss over Andrew Marr's appointment as the BBC's political editor. As a former Labour party member and devotee of the Blair mission, his hiring has caused concern among some Conservatives who fear less-than-impartial reporting from him.</p> <p> I suspect this will prove unfounded. Marr may not be a great newspaperman - his brief editorship of the Independent was a disaster - but he is long on integrity and will bend over backwards to be fair to those whose views he does not share.</p> <p> The point here, however is that the BBC does not need Marr to set it on a leftward leaning course, because running through the corporation, from top to bottom, like the word Blackpool through a stick of rock, is a liberal agenda, set by patronising, middle-class, guilt-ridden do-gooders who dominate its corridors.</p> <p> The worst examples can be heard daily on Radio 4. If this were your only source of news and information, you would inevitably conclude that happily married Anglo-Saxon, heterosexual law-abiding tax-payers are a dying breed on these islands.</p> <p> No doubt, someone from the BBC will dub me a homophobic racist for saying so - a charge I reject - but Radio 4's programming displays an obsessive obsequiousness to the interests and concerns of social and ethnic minorities, the unemployed, and those who enjoy denigrating conventional values.</p> <p> The BBC should, of course, cater for all sections of Britain. And that includes financially secure, hard-working citizens (ie, the vast majority), who are proud of this country, content with their lot, and do not regard the Union Jack as a symbol of evil.</p> <p> Politically correct Radio 4 gives far too much credence to the claims of professional gripers who want compensation, usually in the form of government hand-outs, simply for being less well-off than they would like.</p> <p> By contrast, the flagship station's coverage of business matters is almost non-existent. The Financial World Tonight was shunted off to the graveyard slot of 11.15pm on Radio 5 long ago.</p> <p> Business is rarely covered in Radio 4 news bulletins, unless it is a story about a beastly multi-national making workers redundant or fat-cat directors collecting outrageous salaries.</p> <p> It is as though this country's executive class, whose taxes underpin the funding of the BBC, does not exist.</p> <p> The BBC's new director general, Greg Dyke, made a personal fortune from business. It's about time he looked at the corporation's institutionalised bias against free-enterprise wealth-creators - and did something about it.</p>",
  "The government has after weeks of debate decided to face down the fuel protesters, but is to offer instead a mix of concessions designed to speed a restructuring of the haulage industry. <p>Ministers have decided to freeze <b> fuel duty</b> for the general motorist - in effect a real terms cut of 2p - since duty will not be uprated in line with inflation. The freeze may be extended for a further year. </p> <p>In view of the huge hike in fuel prices even since the last September protest, this hardly represents a major concession. Fuel prices have risen by between 2p and 4p in most petrol forecourts over the past few weeks. </p> <p>Lord Macdonald, the transport minister, has rejected evidence of 30% over-capacity in the industry, arguing the statistics are four years out of date and based on doubtful methodology. Nevertheless, he appears attracted to the idea of <b> scrappage allowance</b>, under which the government would pay hauliers to leave the industry. This would be linked to an increase in the cost to hauliers of the special licence needed to enter the industry. He has also examined the degree to which foreign truckers are penetrating the British industry and concluded competition in hauling goods across the channel has become more intense. </p> <p>This suggests he will accept the case for a <b> Britdisc</b> in which foreign hauliers will have to pay a tax to use British roads. The proposal will not breach EU law so long as the disc is also imposed on British hauliers, but matching compensation would be offered to British hauliers through lower rates of vehicle excise duty. </p> <p>Ministers also want to help rural motorists more dependent on petrol. The government has rejected lower<b> vehicle excise duty</b> based on the owners' postcode. </p> <p>But ministers are attracted to relaxing business duties on rural petrol stations, many of which could be regarded as a social service. </p> <p>Some form of <b> windfall tax</b> on the oil companies is also ruled out. The measure would hit some marginal seats in eastern England and Scotland. </p> <p>It would also infuriate the powerful oil barons many of whom have been investigated by the competition authorities only less than two years ago. </p> <p>However, the office of fair trading may give the oil companies a blast for trying to squeeze out independent petrol retailers.</p>",
  "The pressure is piling on. Tomorrow Gordon Brown will give a pre-Budget report which will be seen as both a response to the fuel protests of September and a groundlaying exercise for the next election. He has to offer a package which somehow neutralises the arguments of the petrol blockaders and makes sense to everyone else. <p>As our poll shows today, that will be no mean feat. A majority, though declining, still supports the protesters in their demands and even, it seems, their methods. And yet, when asked whether public resources would be better spent on pensions or a cut in petrol duty, voters chose the elderly. In other words, we want to have our cake and eat it: somehow Mr Brown has to give us both. To make matters more complex, a targeted pension boost, aimed at the poorest, will please most voters - but not the pensioners themselves. They continue to favour an across-the-board rise - and to back the Tories by a whopping, 49-29 point margin. Politically, the chancellor has his work cut out. </p> <p>Yet the government's task is larger even than the petrol vs pensions dilemma. Labour has to address something more nebulous than the hard data of this morning's poll - but potentially more dangerous. It needs to arrest the vague, but accelerating sense of chaos - the fear that a combination of floods, broken railways and petrol queues has left the country falling apart. The clamour is rising: a panic that Britain is crumbling, that nothing works. </p> <p>Of course, the sage voices will wave aside such talk as hyperbole. In reality, they say, the current \"chaos\" is merely a convergence of separate, explicable problems. The floods are no one's fault, the railways needed repair work and are now getting it, and the petrol crisis is a manmade one - the hauliers could remove their threat in an instant. But the government should not be so complacent. For Britons submerged in floodwater or marooned by trains that do not run will not always be so cool-headed. Instead, and this sentiment is growing, they will lash out at those meant to be in charge: they will blame the government. </p> <p>Labour needs no history lessons in this area. It knows the election-losing damage wrought by the winter of discontent; it knows how Edward Heath paid when he lost control in 1973. So the government must do more than survive this current anxiety: it has to reassert its grip. </p> <p>It is easy to point out what should have been done already. Of course, Labour should, by now, have explained and implemented its \"integrated transport strategy\", so that the haphazard shutdown of our railways would not have been possible. It could have done that even without ripping its own two-year straitjacket of Tory spending limits: it could have unveiled a plan in 1997, spending no new cash till 1999. Instead it has let transport be an area which has not only failed to improve under Labour, but which has actually got worse. </p> <p>Still, that is in the past. The task now is to make up lost ground. The government has a plan, unveiled earlier this year, which needs executing with merciless drive. The quicker it bears fruit the better. But Labour can also learn from its practice in other areas. It talks endlessly about standards in education, publicly excoriating teachers who fail to meet them. Why not apply the same approach to the beneficiaries of transport privatisation, the franchise holders and others who have, in some cases, so visibly failed to live up to their promises?

  "The French are not by nature a litigious nation, but amid an ever-escalating consumer fears about the safety of their steak-frites, the state now is facing at least two law suits alleging that it failed to take sufficient action to prevent the spread of mad cow disease in France. <p>Add to that a warning today by the junior health minister, Dominique Gillot, that the country should prepare itself for \"several dozen\" cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the fatal human variant of BSE, and it is no wonder that sales of beef in the home of the faux filet, the chateaubriand and the tournedos have plummeted.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9's small farmers' union, the Confederation Paysanne, claims that successive governments have turned a blind eye to the fact that some 14,000 tonnes of potentially dangerous British meat and bone meal was illegally imported into France from 1993 to 1996, despite a ban imposed in 1990.</p> <p>Mr Bov\u00e9, whose colourful campaign against \"la malbouffe\" -which could be politely translated as \"crap food\" - has made him a popular and respected figure in France, wants every agriculture minister since 1988 put in the dock as \"accessories\" to allowing the imports, which are documented in customs reports, to continue.</p> <p>Separately, the parents of a young victim of nvCJD have said they plan to sue the state for \"poisoning\" their son, who was shown in the final stages of the disease in a harrowing French TV documentary on Monday.</p> <p>\"Officials asked us to be quiet,\" said the mother of the young man, identified only as Arnaud. \"But people made mistakes, and there is no reason why they should not pay for them.</p> <p>\"Every day, we hear farmers crying because their herds have been slaughtered. They are compensated and can buy new cows. We can't buy a new son.\"</p> <p>Poisoning is a heavily loaded term in France: it was the charge originally brought against three government ministers accused of ignoring scientific warnings and allowing HIV-contaminated blood to be used by the national transfusion service, the country's biggest public health scandal to date that cost hundreds of lives.</p> <p>Fuelled by a steadily increasing number of BSE cases uncovered in France, fears are mounting.</p> <p>More than half the schools in Paris and a dozen other large cities like Toulouse and Lille have outlawed beef from their canteens, a major chain of steak restaurants refuses to serve beef on the bone, and sales of the suddenly suspect meat have fallen by 30% across the country.</p> <p>Poland has now joined Hungary and Russia in banning imports of beef from France, adding to a wider collapse of public confidence in the quality of French food.</p> <p>\"Food: the French no longer trust it,\" said Le Parisien newspaper yesterday - an extraordinary admission in a country that has for so long viewed itself as the hub of world gastronomy.</p> <p>But are such fears really necessary? The answer is yes - but only partly. On the one hand, the scale of the BSE epidemic in France does not even begin to compare with that seen in Britain.</p> <p>So far, two people have died in France of vCJD, against more than 80 in Britain, and there have been a total of 166 cases of BSE compared with some 80 a day in Britain at the height of the scare.</p> <p>What's more, the recent surge in the number of in French cases is due almost exclusively to a new and stringent testing programme unique in the EU.</p> <p>On the other hand, there are several reasons to suspect French beef may not now be as safe a British beef. The agriculture minister, Jean Glavany, has said there is \"no question\" of France following Britain and banning beef on the bone.</p> <p>Instead, officials will look into different ways of curing the meat to separate the ribs from the potentially dangerous spinal column.</p> <p>Equally, France has not, so far, imposed a 30-month rule banning from human consumption all meat from cows more than two-and-a-half years old, and neither has it outlawed meat and bone meal from all animal feeds as Britain did in 1996.</p> <p>At present, meat and bone meal can still be fed to pigs and chickens -despite the fact that almost all cases of BSE identified in France can be attributed to cows being fed, inadvertently or deliberately, meal meant for other animals.</p> <p>The current Gallic mad cow scare is, in all probability, exaggerated. A leading independent expert believes existing safety measures are enough to ensure the disease is eradicated in 2002.</p> <p>But the public fear, and the court cases that threaten to flow from it, will at least have the benefit of forcing the French out of their complacency.</p> <p>In the words of Le Figaro newspaper, consumers feel betrayed. \"The veil is being lifted from the fraud, the fiddling and the cynicism that have for so long reigned from one end of our food chain to the other.\"</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:jon.henley@theguardian.com\">jon.henley@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/concorde/0,7368,347037,00.html\">Concorde crash</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=jon+henley&amp;Query=jon+henley&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=Vdkpublicationdate+desc&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Jon Henley</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://tout.lemonde.fr/\" target=\"_new\">Le Monde</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.liberation.fr/\" target=\"_new\">Lib\u00e9ration</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/\" target=\"_new\">Le Figaro</a><br><a href=\"http://quotidien.nouvelobs.com/\" target=\"_new\">Le Nouvel Observateur</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.leparisien.fr/\" target=\"_new\">Le Parisien</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.lesechos.fr/\" target=\"_new\">Les Echos</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.afp.com/english/home/\" target=\"_new\">Agence France-Presse</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.tf1.fr/\" target=\"_new\">TF1</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.radio-france.fr/\" target=\"_new\">Radio France</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.goodmorningparis.com/\" target=\"_new\">Good Morning Paris</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.paris-web.com/\" target=\"_new\">Paris web</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ladocfrancaise.gouv.fr/cgi-bin/multitel/CATALDOC/accueil_df  \" target=\"_new\">La Documentation Fran\u00e7aise</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.politicalresources.net/france.htm\" target=\"_new\">Political resources</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.elysee.fr/\" target=\"_new\">The Elys\u00e9e palace</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.premier-ministre.gouv.fr/\" target=\"_new\">French prime minister's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.internet.gouv.fr/francais/index.html  \" target=\"_new\">French government</a></p>",
  "A millionaire businessman murdered his wife in the bath of their home and then claimed an intruder was responsible for her death, a court was told yesterday. <p>Nadine Phillips, 34, was found naked and face down in the bath in the family home in Putney, south-west London, in May. </p> <p>Bruises on her arms, hips and back indicated she had been \"forced down\" into the water, the pathologist who examined the body said. </p> <p>Her husband, Alun Phillips, 36, denies murder. In a statement to police, he said he had \"no reason or motive, financial or otherwise, to kill my wife\". </p> <p>The couple had been married for seven years at the time of Mrs Phillips's death and had three children, Nicholas Hilliard, prosecuting, told Southwark crown court. They owned two children's nurseries in Fulham. At the beginning of this year, they sold one for more than \u00a31m. </p> <p>The couple slept in separate beds in their semi-detached, three-storey house. Mrs Phillips's bedroom, which had an en suite bathroom, was on the first floor. Mr Phillips slept in the office on the top floor, the court heard. </p> <p>On May 15 a friend of Mrs Phillips, who telephoned her at 8.37pm, said that she sounded \"very cheerful and her normal self\". </p> <p>Mr Hilliard said: \"This is the last time the prosecution can say for certain that Mrs Phillips was alive.\" </p> <p>At 7.50am the next day, a school bus driver, who came to the house to collect one of the children, told the court that he was greeted by Mr Phillips and two of his children. The driver said that Mr Phillips would usually put a note on the door asking him to knock rather than press the buzzer when his wife slept in. There was no note on the door on May 15. </p> <p>At 10.30am, Mr Phillips telephoned for an ambulance and said there was \"a problem\" with his wife. </p> <p>Mr Hilliard said that a member of the ambulance crew told Mr Phillips that the temperature and stiffness of his wife's body suggested she had been dead for several hours. </p> <p>\"The defendant started shouting and said his wife had been involved in an incident the night before with a 'fucking nutcase',\" Mr Hilliard said. </p> <p>The jury of six men and six women was told Mrs Phillips had made an appointment with her doctor at 9.30am that day. </p> <p>In a statement to police, Mr Phillips claimed that at around 8.30pm on May 15, his wife had told him that she had seen a stranger at the front door of their home. </p> <p>\"He also told police that his wife had described the man involved in this incident as weird... and he said he had been worried recently about someone hanging about the house,\" Mr Hilliard told the court. </p> <p>Mr Phillips told police that he had found the front door open at 11.30pm and set the alarm just before midnight. He did not check on his wife until the next morning. </p> <p>The court heard that the alarm went off just before 1am. It was deactivated moments later and not reset for the rest of the night. </p> <p>Mr Hilliard said that Mr Phillips was \"very security conscious\". </p> <p>The family home was fitted with protective grilles, an alarm, a video entry system and the front door had several locks and bolts. </p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",
  "The government is reviewing the safety of over-the-counter cough and cold treatments following US fears over one of their key ingredients. <p>Ministers have instructed the medicines control agency (MCA) to conduct urgent checks on brand names such as Day Nurse, Night Nurse, Contact 400, Sinutab, Benylin and Vicks.</p> <p>The products will remain on sale but the Department of Health last night advised concerned members of the public to contact their GP or chemist.</p> <p>The alarm was raised after the American food and drug administration determined that an ingredient called phenylpropanolamine (PPA), used in drugs to suppress patients' appetites was unsafe. It has been linked to the deaths of between 200 and 500 people under 50 in the US.</p> <p>The Department of Health said last night: \"These concerns have been raised in the states because PPA is used at very high levels in appetite suppressants. At a much lower level, it is used in cough and cold medicines. The amount of ingredient manufacturers are allowed to use in this country is much lower.</p> <p>\"Having said that, we have asked the MCA to conduct a review of the safety of PPAs, discuss their use with the FDA and report to us as quickly as possible.\"</p> <p>Medicines would remain on sale for the time being and people should not feel \"unduly concerned\" but a department spokesman added: \"If anybody is concerned, they should discuss it with their pharmacist or GP and they will get the best possible advice.\"</p> <p>The department said the ingredient was not available as an appetite suppressant in this country in an over-the-counter product.</p> <p>The FDA's action came two weeks after a scientific advisory committee reviewed a new study that made a connection between PPA and an increased risk for stroke, especially in young women.</p> <p>The committee advised that PPA could no longer be \"generally recognised as safe\" according to the results of the study by Yale University.</p> <p>The drug industry has generally fought the FDA regarding the safety of phenylpropanolamine, arguing that it has been used for decades and that evidence of a possible risk is unconvincing.</p> <p>Bu the recent test findings are in line with other research going back 20 years, suggesting there might be problems. It showed that people aged 18 to 49 who took PPA had a small increased risk of stroke.</p> <p>American consumers were yesterday advised to avoid certain products until the ingredient has been replaced and to check labels carefully. \"We don't want to be alarmist, but it is important for consumers to know there are real risks associated with taking this ingredient. The adverse effects are rare, but they can be fatal while the conditions treated by the ingredient are not,\" said Charles Ganley, director of the FDA's non-prescription drug division. He said the FDA's action was not a recall, but a request for drug companies to voluntarily take products with PPA off the market. The agency would propose a formal new rule limiting the use of PPA.</p> <p>It is the second review to be called by the British govern ment in a week following a FDA verdict. Food standards chiefs and veterinary advisers are checking the safety of Baytril, a medicine used on poultry because it contains an antibiotic that appears to generate resistance in humans to drugs designed to fight food poisoning.</p>",
  "In Brooklyn's Crown Heights, Sandra Brathwaite stands at the top of her block and delivers an ethnic inventory. \"That side is all Jewish,\" she says, pointing to the right. \"And this side is black... well a mix of African-American and Caribbean really. But the Jews have started moving over.\" As she continues down Eastern Parkway, her vocal audit keeps pace with her stride. \"This house is black, that house is black, that one is Jewish, the next three are black, the one after that is Jewish... I could go on.\" <p>On one side of the street, the African-American flag flies from the black firefighters hall; on the other, inscriptions on an ambulance and posters on lamp-posts are in Yiddish. Geographically close yet culturally distant, politically united yet mutually antagonistic, once economically interdependent, now socially stratified - the story of the relationship between African-Americans and Jews is long and complex. It is a narrative stretching back through the last century and beyond, which has veered from the inspiring to the horrific. They were once great allies during the civil rights era and within the Democratic party, but more recently have been bitter and sometimes bloody foes. </p> <p>But now black-Jewish relations seem to be entering a more optimistic, if uncertain phase. The nomination of Joseph Lieberman, a Jewish senator from Connecticut, as running mate to the Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore, has proved an unlikely catalyst for a desire on both sides for greater understanding, if not reconciliation. Lieberman's nomination received the warm endorsement of the Reverend Jesse Jackson - once reviled in the Jewish community for referring to New York as \"Heimie town\". Lieberman in turn has extended an olive branch to the leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan - the man who branded Judaism \"a gutter religion\" and called Hitler \"a great man\". Farrakhan looks as though he may accept. \"I would welcome a meeting... it could be a bridge between the black community and the Jewish community,\" he said. </p> <p>There has been as much pragmatism in this as principle. African-Americans are the most loyal constituency the Democrats have. Since the second world war the Democratic party has only once won the presidency - with Lyndon Johnson in 1964 - with a majority of the white vote. One of Lieberman's first visits after being officially nominated this summer was to the Congressional black caucus. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Farrakhan's church is struggling to overcome high-level defections, following accusations of adultery and federal lawsuits alleging sexual harassment. Farrakhan, who is suffering from prostate cancer, is in search of a meaningful legacy. His attempt to cement one earlier this month through the Million Family March failed, thanks to a poor turnout. Reinventing himself as a religious and racial healer rather than an anti-semitic firebreather may be his last hope. </p> <p>Embarking on this new route has not been without its obstacles on both sides. Explaining the rationale behind Lieberman's selection, Harlem's black newspaper, the Amsterdam News, wrote in an editorial: \"The reasoning in the Gore camp went out all over the world to Jews of means: 'You've got to show me the money.' The word went out... that the major protector of Jews in this world, the American government, is now available.\" Meanwhile, two major Jewish lobbying organisations, the Anti-Defamation League and the Republican Jewish Coalition, urged Lieberman to stay away from Farrakhan. </p> <p>One reason for this climate of mistrust and antagonism is economic. Pogroms and poverty sent a large number of Jews to America from eastern Europe at the beginning of the last century; roughly the same time that racism and poverty delivered African-Americans from the south to the north. As is the case in Crown Heights today, they often lived cheek by jowl. With access to mortgages, loans or a decent education denied to most African-Americans and granted to Jews - because they were white - an unequal economic relationship soon developed. </p> <p>James Baldwin, in his essay The Harlem Ghetto, wrote of Jews, particularly Jewish landlords, \"They operate in accordance with the American business tradition of exploiting negroes and they are therefore identified with oppression and are hated for it.\" In short, the standard tension between landlords and tenants or employers and employees took on an ethnic dimension. As Jews advanced economically and moved out of black areas, this particular relationship died, but the prejudice continued. </p> <p>This is reflected in polling data. \"There are certain stereotypes that black Americans are more likely to believe about Jews than white Americans,\" says Tom Smith, a social scientist at the university of Chicago. \"Namely, that Jews are 'unscrupulous in business' and 'mean about money'. In all other aspects they are no more negative than white Americans.\" </p> <p>Nor, some are keen to point out, does the fact that both groups endure discrimination mean that they cannot also inflict it. Jews are still white, and African-Americans are still gentiles; the former can still be racist; the latter can still be anti-semitic. Nowhere was this clearer than in Crown Heights almost 10 years ago, after a Hasidic driver ran over a seven-year-old African American boy and was then attacked by a mob. A Hasidic ambulance arrived first and took care of the driver while the boy and his injured cousin had to wait for a city ambulance. The boy died. Hours later black youths killed a rabbinical student in revenge. Riots ensued. </p> <p>Add an organisation like the Nation of Islam to the mix, says David Bositis, a senior political analyst at the joint centre for political and economic studies in Washington, and the possible points of conflict grow. \"Muslims and Jewish people are at odds. Jews are basically white and the NOI's creed is that the devil created white people. On those grounds alone you wouldn't expect them to get on.\" </p> <p>Bositis believes that to concentrate on Farrakhan's anti-semitism is to misunderstand both his function and his importance. \"He's said a lot of things that are anti-semitic, but the question is, does it represent anything significant about black politics? The answer is no. It may be central to his message but not to his meaning.\" </p> <p>None of this makes solidarity between Jews and African-Americans impossible. Far from it. Jews were overrepresented in the struggle for civil rights, partly because they had a keen sense of what it meant to be denied rights. There was an element of self-preservation in it too: the principal target for southern bigotry was blacks, but Jews were not far behind. When legislation came to remove many of the legal barriers to equality, Jews would benefit too. </p> <p>Because Jews have experienced discrimination first hand, Bositis says, \"On balance they are less racist than the typical white person.\" It is facile to trade off the two groups' completely different experiences of oppression, as though the Holocaust and slavery were two chips in a poker game of victimisation. This not only belittles the suffering but insults the sufferer. In 1926, Louis Marshall, a Jewish jurist and supporter of black rights, addressed the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People with tales of massacres of Jews in Europe. \"We were subject to indignities in comparison with which to sit in a Jim Crow car is to occupy a palace,\" he said to a stunned and angry audience. </p> <p>Never were these differences more apparent than in the post-civil rights era of Black Power. \"Black people felt they had to assert control of the movement, and there wasn't much room for any whites, including Jewish people, in that,\" says Smith. </p> <p> The two groups became estranged by class as well as race and religion. Jews, as a community, got wealthier, while blacks, on the whole, remained at the bottom of the pile. \"There are class differences as you would understand them in Europe,\" says Smith, \"in terms of whole culture, education, expectations, rather than just money.\" </p> <p>This created tensions that have been most evident around affirmative action - a matter of great importance to African-Americans. Smith says, \"Jews are more likely to believe that affirmative action might exacerbate differences than assuage them.\" </p> <p>Some say this is because before the war many universities established quotas to restrict Jewish entrants. The quotas were removed, thanks to the struggle for civil rights, but because Jews fought against them on principle then, many still oppose them now. As the commentator Jerome Chanes says: \"For Jews, quotas were a way of keeping people out; for African-Americans, quotas were a way of letting people in.\" </p> <p>Either way, Lieberman's selection was not a subject for intellectual debate but a matter of urgent political significance. He headed straight for the Congressional black caucus because he had made remarks supporting a Californian proposition to outlaw affirmative action in all state programmes. Moreover, for four years he had been chairman of the Democratic leadership council, representing rightwing Democrats, which often found itself in opposition to liberals such as Jesse Jackson. It was vital that Lieberman kept African-Americans on board. </p> <p>\"He said it is one thing to be the leader of a faction, but another to represent the whole organisation,\" says Ron Walker at the University of Maryland. \"He did convince people that whatever he might have said, he had an impressive voting record on these matters.\" </p> <p>Whether this new era of cooperation, if not friendship, will last after the election has yet to be seen. Voltaire said: \"One regards the Jews the same way as one regards the negroes, as a species of inferior humanity.\" Having faced the common enemy of intolerance, there is hope, in some quarters at least, that they may once again find common cause.</p>",
  "Tobacco giants Philip Morris and R J Reynolds are being sued in a New York court for their alleged involvement in smuggling cigarettes into the European Union, it was announced yesterday. <p>In an extraordinary move, the European Commission said the two US corporations - named for the first time in this unprecedented case - were accused of breaches of the US Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organisation Act. </p> <p>Under these laws, introduced to wipe out mob crime, the EU can claim three times the amount of lost revenue from unpaid customs duties and VAT - believed to run into billions of dollars - in compensation. </p> <p>The development adds to the legal difficulties faced by big tobacco companies, recently hit by huge punitive damages awards. </p> <p>Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco company, is best known for its Marlboro brand. R.J. Reynolds' products include Camel and Winston cigarettes. </p> <p>Michaele Schreyer, the EU budget commissioner, said Brussels was also seeking an injunction preventing further smuggling. </p> <p>\"The present case is a new step in our strategy to fight against fraud and financial irregularities,\" Ms Schreyer said in a statement. </p> <p>Philip Morris yesterday said it would vigorously contest the EU's smuggling allegations and attacked the \"unprecedented\" use of US law courts by a foreign government. </p> <p>The company blamed the fact that it had not seen the lawsuit, which was filed in New York, for its inability to comment on the specific EU allegations. </p> <p>But, in a statement, David Davies, European spokesman for the company, said: \"Philip Morris Europe does not understand why, either as a matter of law or practice, the European Commission has chosen to address this issue in a US court rather than through regulatory and co-operative actions within the framework of the European Union.\" </p> <p>But Clive Bates, director of Ash, the anti-smoking lobby group, said last night: \"The authorities are finally getting to grips with the real commercial drivers behind smuggling - and that's the tobacco companies. These really are the Mr Bigs.\" </p> <p>Last week the Department of Trade and Industry ordered an investigation into allegations that British American Tobacco orchestrated cigarette smuggling. </p> <p>Yesterday's decision to sue Philip Morris and R J Reynolds was taken by the European Commission last July in its role as guardian of the treaties and of the community's $95bn annual budget. </p> <p>It followed a two-year inves tigation by the EU's independent fraud-busting office, Olaf, together with national police and customs authorities. </p> <p>Cigarette smuggling constitutes the biggest single fraud against the budget, with a single container of cigarettes worth almost 1m euros in tax. </p> <p>The civil action was filed last Friday in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Individual European governments may launch similar actions. </p> <p>In some countries, contraband cigarettes account for 10% of all sales. Italy, where the business is run by highly organised Mafia gangs, has a very serious problem with smuggling. </p> <p>Outside the EU, illicit cigarettes are the mainstay of the Montenegran economy, undermining efforts to push through reforms in a country that is already heavily dependent on western aid. </p> <p>Suspicions of tobacco industry involvement in cigarette smuggling have grown since 1997 when researchers demonstrated, by comparing annual global exports with global imports, that about a third of all cigarettes entering international markets each year could not be accounted for.</p>",
  "Americans do not just vote for a president today. They also elect a new House of Representatives, one third of the Senate, eleven state governors, and thousands of local council, school board and other posts in hundreds of towns, counties and states. In addition, voters in 39 states must decide on more than 180 state-wide ballot propositions as well as hundreds more at local level. <p>By far the most important of the other elections is the battle for the 435-seat House of Representatives, all of whose members will be elected today - as they are every two years. </p> <p>Ever since the Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich, swept to power in the House in 1994, the Democrats have struggled to regain ground in subsequent contests. However, in 1998, at the height of the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, the party cut the Republican majority to 11, and hopes were high at the start of the campaign of ousting the Republicans from control. </p> <p>The Democrats have put more resources than ever into their efforts to win the House. Nevertheless, the latest projections suggest that they may fall a seat or two short of ousting the Republican speaker Dennis Hastert and replacing him with Richard Gephardt. </p> <p>Most of the battle for the House centres, as usual, on two dozen or so \"competitive\" seats, scattered widely across the country and reflecting all sorts of local issues and demographic features. </p> <p>Among the most closely watched are one in Florida, where the Republican congressman Clay Shaw is struggling to hold on, and another in California where one of Mr Clinton's House prosecutors during the impeachment trial, James Rogan, is at risk. </p> <p>In the Senate, where the Republicans have a 54-46 majority over the Democrats, 34 seats are at stake and there is speculation that the Democrats may win enough to tie the arithmetic in the new Senate. </p> <p>By far the most attention has focused on the New York battle between Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio, a seat the Democrats already hold. Last night it was still too close to call with Mrs Clinton slightly ahead, in the polls but within the margin of error. </p> <p>But the real political contests are in states such as Florida, where the Democrat Bill Nelson is ahead of the Republican Bill McCollum - another former House prosecutor of Mr Clinton - in a vacant Republican-held seat. </p> <p>Other key Senate contests this year include Nevada and Virginia, where Republicans have hopes of ousting the Democrats. In Virginia, the Democrat Chuck Robb, who survived a stiff challenge from Colonel Oliver North in 1994, looks vulnerable to former governor George Allen. The Democrats hope to oust Republican incumbents Rod Grams in Minnesota, William Roth in Delaware, Conrad Burns in Montana, Spencer Abraham in Michigan, and Slade Gorton in Washington. </p> <p>Attention is also likely to focus on Missouri, where a dead man, Mel Carnahan, may make history by defeating the incumbent Republican John Ashcroft. Missouri's governor has said he will appoint Mr Carnahan's widow Jean to the seat if her husband wins. </p> <p>The Democrats could end up sending four new women to the Senate. As well as Mrs Carnahan and Mrs Clinton, Maria Cantwell (Washington) and Debbie Stabenow (Michigan) are in with a chance. </p> <p>The Senate arithmetic would be complicated further if Joe Lieberman becomes vice-president. In that case, Mr Lieberman's Connecticut senate seat would become vacant and be filled by a Republican. </p> <p>In the governors' races, the Republicans hope to win Missouri and North Carolina. The Democrats hope to take Montana and West Virginia.</p>",
  "George W Bush practically swaggered into today's presidential election with a visit to Tennessee intended to taunt Al Gore in his own home state. <p>Whether or not he is ready for the presidency, it was clear yesterday that the Republican Texas governor has emerged from the 18-month quest for the White House as a ruthlessly effective campaigner. </p> <p>By the time he flew in to Chattanooga - on his final lap before returning to Austin, Texas to await the results - his get-out-the-vote speech had become a composite of all the applause lines from a thousand previous appearances. </p> <p>Most of those lines fed the desire for revenge among the Republican rank and file after eight years of Democratic administration, by ridiculing Mr Gore - born and raised in Washington to a liberal senator on whose Tennessee farm the son spent family holidays and helped with the work - as a standard-bearer for the \"Washington elite\". </p> <p>\"He forgot his roots,\" Mr Bush told cheering supporters mustered at an aircraft hangar at Chattanooga airport. \"He forgot where he's from. He trusts Washington. We trust the people.\" </p> <p>\"It's always important to have a place from which to run from. I, of course, come from Texas and I plan to carry my home state. My opponent vows to win in his home state. Well he might win Washington DC, but he's not going to win Tennessee.\" </p> <p>On the eve of the vote, polls showed Mr Bush ahead by 49% to 45% in the state where Mr Gore has spent much of his adult political life, as a congressman and then as a senator. </p> <p>Tennessee's 11 votes in the US electoral college which ultimately decides the presidency will be important in a race that seemed to be getting even closer in the final hours. </p> <p>But the real purpose of the lightning Bush visit was to convey the opposite impression - that the tide was running against the Democratic vice-president, even among those who supposedly know him best. To that end, Mr Bush also put in an appearance in President Clinton's home state, Arkansas, as well as two other states which voted in for Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996: Wisconsin and Iowa. </p> <p>Demographically speaking, Mr Gore's troubles in Tennessee are hardly surprising. He got himself elected here as congressman (in 1976) and then senator by campaigning as a rightwing Democrat, a proud tobacco grower who was against gun control and abortion. </p> <p>\"The whole point is that he's not the same person he was back then. He no longer fits the cultural values of this state,\" Robin Smith, a state Republican activist, said. </p> <p>Lewis Weeks, a retired hospital administration worker who had woken up before dawn to catch sight of Mr Gore's Republican rival, put his dislike of the vice-president in blunter terms. \"I absolutely can't stand Al Gore. I hate the ground he walks on.\" </p> <p>Mr Weeks said this was because Mr Gore advocates a strong role for the federal government - a widespread belief, according to the polls, despite Mr Gore's protestations and Mr Bush's record of expanding state government in Texas. Mr Bush seems to have succeeded in getting his message across better. </p> <p>Tennessee is a state in which a substantial majority believes, in the words of one of Mr Bush's warm-up speakers, \"God should write all public policy\", and the Bush campaign has been effective in portraying the Clinton years of sexual embarrassment as a time of darkness. By this means the Texas governor has also been able to depict a country in crisis despite the record economic growth of the Clinton era. </p> <p>Speaker after speaker on the stage in Chattanooga, spoke of the need for national moral redemption, and Lorretta Lyn, a Tennessee country singer, cooed about \"putting America back on its feet\". </p> <p>Another technique, used extensively at the Republican convention and at every campaign stop since, has been to position black Americans directly behind the candidate. The TV cameras recording this a racially inclusive backdrop seldom capture the whiteness of the rank-and-file. In Chattanooga, where racial politics run deep, there were three black Tennesseans on the Bush podium, but none I could see in a 5,000-strong crowd. </p> <p>The only other blacks in the area were on the far side of the airport fence - two members of the local steelworkers' union holding a lonely demonstration. One of them, James Muckle, declared: \"Our vice-president supports the union, and the working man.\" </p> <p>African-Americans swung Tennessee for Bill Clinton in 1996, but some doubt they will do the same for an understudy, who has never had the same rapport with minorities as his mentor.</p>",
  "The government could easily afford to restore the crucial link between state pensions and the rise in average earnings, according to an analysis by its financial advisers showing a surplus of more than \u00a38bn in the national insurance fund. <p>A report by the government actuary will fuel pressure from Labour leftwingers, union leaders and pensioners who are due to lobby parliament today on the eve of Gordon Brown's pre-budget statement. </p> <p>The Treasury has been signalling a likely increase of \u00a35 a week for single pensioners and \u00a38 for couples. This would be well above the rate of wage inflation over the past year, but would fall short of restoring the long-term link with earnings, as the Labour conference requested in a defeat for ministers in September. </p> <p>The actuary's report - to be published on Thursday - follows a successful amendment by Lady Castle to the social security bill that became law in the summer. It obliged the government to publish an estimate of how much money would be available in the national insurance fund over the next five years to pay for pension increases linked to the rise in average earnings. </p> <p>Figures prepared by Andrew Young, the deputy actuary, are understood to show there would be enough in the kitty to re-establish the link - at least throughout the five years of the next parliament. </p> <p>There was a \u00a38.43bn surplus in the fund last year as income from national insurance con tributions continued to exceed outgoings. Although this could be expected to shrink if above-inflation increases are introduced next April, the surplus would build up again unless the earnings link was restored. </p> <p>Jack Jones, president of the National Pensioners Convention, said: \"That money should be used to increase the state pension and restore the link with earnings. It is money accumulating year by year, paid in by today's workers for pensioners to draw just as those pensioners paid in when they were at work for others to withdraw. That is the basis of national social insurance. The principle is at stake and we have to defend it.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Social Security said ministers were aware of the surplus. </p> <p>Before any announcements by the chancellor this week, the government was already committed to spend \u00a32.5bn more on pensioners than would have been required to match increases in average earnings. But the extra was being spent on the minimum income guarantee, free television licences and other targeted benefits, she said. </p> <p>An indication of the government's nervousness on the issue came when leaders of the pension campaign were invited to separate meetings with the prime minister and chancellor during today's lobby of parliament. </p> <p>Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, said 106 MPs including 86 Labour backbenchers signed a Commons motion demanding restoration of the earnings link.</p>",
  "<p>Proton, the state-owned Malaysian car maker reported to be talking to MG Rover, yesterday denied reports it was planning to float its 80% owned Lotus sports car company. </p> <p>Rumours of a possible sale had been triggered by a \u00a340m fundraising exercise by Group Lotus which required it to re-register as a public limited company. The issue of floating rate notes was 70% oversubscribed. </p> <p>Proton said that it had no intention of selling its stake in Lotus Cars, with which it planned to develop a two-litre sports car. The Malaysian group owns 80% of Lotus Group International, which owns 100% of Group Lotus and its Lotus Cars subsidiary. </p> <p>However, Proton made no mention in its formal statement of reported negotiations with MG Rover, the troubled British car maker seeking an alliance with a larger manufacturer. </p> <p>Chris Knight, Group Lotus chief executive, told a Malaysian newspaper that the proceeds of the notes issue would be used to maintain the existing business and ensure future growth. </p> <p>\"We are committed to consistent, year-on-year growth of Lotus. In the last two years alone we have invested heavily in the business by constructing new manufacturing facilities, tripling production capacity and building a state-of-the-art research and development centre. </p> <p>\"In addition, we have been making strategic acquisitions of engineering facilities in Coventry and testing facilities in Michigan. The funding will ensure that the group maintains this growth.\" </p> <p>Mr Knight said that while Group Lotus had to become a public listed company for the notes issue to be traded, no equity was being issued and the firm's ownership would not be affected. \"Proton continues to control Group Lotus.\" The Malaysian government is considering selling up to 30% of Proton to foreign companies.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Small firms not ready for euro</strong><br> About 600,000 British small firms with trading links to the European Union have made no preparations for working in the euro even though the currency will be in circulation in 14 months, the Treasury said yesterday. </p> <p>The Treasury's fourth report on euro preparation found that only 28% of small and medium-sized enterprises that trade with Europe had made any plans, leaving nearly three quarters who had not even begun to address the issue. </p> <p>A survey carried out in April this year suggests that the government's waning desire for early UK entry to the euro has persuaded small firms in England, Scotland and Wales to put the issue on the back burner. It showed that just 1% more of such firms had begun preparations for the euro from last year even though the day when they will be directly affected by the eurozone's use of the euro as its only operating currency is fast approaching.</p> <p><strong> Italian deal for Clifford Chance </strong><br> Law firms Clifford Chance, based in London, and Italy's Grimaldi e Associati said yesterday they would merge, in the latest example of consolidation in the legal sector. </p> <p>The merger, due to take effect on January 1, comes after the two firms originally set up a joint venture in Italy seven years ago called Grimaldi e Clifford Chance. </p> <p>Clifford Chance has already expanded overseas after its merger last year with New York-based Rogers &amp; Wells and Germany's Puender, Volhard, Weber &amp; Axster. </p> <p><strong> Water council 'lacks bite'</strong><br> Ofwat's National Customer Council has said the new independent Consumer Council for Water must have stronger powers than those proposed in the draft water bill published yesterday. </p> <p>ONCC chairman Sheila Reiter said: \"I am not convinced that a 'one size fits all' approach to regulation and customer protection in the utilities is practicable or sensible.

  "It is becoming less and less likely the government's public-private partnership (PPP) to improve and expand London's tube will see the light of day. <p>Here comes Bob Kiley from New York as transport commissioner and with him a chance to resolve the funding question once for all. He demonstrated that investment in a municipally owned urban railway can be secured and he knows how to do it. Mr Kiley, in London yesterday full of doubts about the government scheme, starts full-time in January. </p> <p>The PPP proposed three separate 30-year contracts with private companies which would do track and signalling plus a fourth public company running trains. Even before the Hatfield crash it was unpopular and poorly understood. </p> <p>The crash eroded confidence in the ability of a private company to manage a railway. The inquiries into Paddington and other accidents may or may not conclude that privatisation was a factor but the general public will see PPP as more of the \"fragmentation\" that ministers have themselves condemned. It is also inconsistent to devolve power to a London authority, then expect the mayor and commissioner to be responsible for deals negotiated for them by Whitehall. </p> <p>In any case, the sheer complexity of negotiations make it uncertain the PPP deal will be completed by the latest target date - April 2001, already a year late. Labour faces the prospect of an election campaign without having achieved any of its 1987 objectives for the tube, whilst incurring vast expense on consultants. </p> <p>There are two alternatives to PPP. One is to simply keep the tube under the direct control of central government. This could have been accepted without more ado from the beginning. A much more sensible alternative would be to pass it to the mayor and leave him to decide how to pay for investment. Mr Kiley's proven experience teamed with Mr Livingstone's strong electoral mandate should be quite a force. </p> <p>But how to pay? Some new method needs to be found and while the American experience of using revenue bonds is useful, there is work to be done to establish such a scheme in the UK. </p> <p>The ball has to land in the Greater London Authority's court. Contrary to popular belief, the PPP relates only to the underground as it is and the GLA will have to find ways to finance any new tube lines. Second, the mayor is committed to introducing congestion charging. This will make much more sense as part of transport strategy if part of the revenue can be capitalised to finance trains and buses. </p> <p>A \"plan B\" is going to be needed anyway. The government can proceed with the PPP only if the independent health and safety executive says it is safe and the national audit office certifies it gives value for money. The absence of either could stop the PPP and it would be intolerable to suffer further delay. </p> <p>A different approach would involve issuing bonds under the GLA's auspices. Two types are possible: government-guaranteed bonds (such as those for the Channel tunnel rail link) or \"revenue bonds\", backed by dedicated revenues, without government guarantee. The Americans use a \"public benefit corporation\" through which government retains control but management and finance are done separately. New York's metropolitan transportation authority is an example. </p> <p>Here trusts were common in the 18th century as a means of funding and procuring local services - they were the very beginnings of local government. The port of London authority was created in 1908 as a public trust agency with the capacity to issue its own bonds, secured by port revenues. It still exists. The London passenger transport board, existed as a trust from 1933 to 1948, with Treasury authority to issue bonds for capital investment. </p> <p>For argument's sake, if a London body issued bonds for a term of 30 years paying 7.5% a year, London Underground's operating surplus of \u00a3250m a year could support a bond issue of approximately \u00a33bn. Every \u00a3100m a year of added cash would support bonds worth \u00a31.2bn. That added cash could be government grant (which would be forthcoming in any case under the PPP) or special fees or levies. This type of financing structure could accommodate other kinds of capital spending as London's local government develops. The chart shows how income from fares generates a surplus over running costs, but not enough to pay for needed investment. </p> <p>The counter argument is that bonds would leave London Transport's poor-quality management intact. But Mr Kiley will expect to seek efficiencies and it would be perfectly possible for bond issues to be invested in pro jects where private firms are brought in to manage projects or goods and services procured using the best business practice. </p> <p>The point is that there are precedents for almost any financing structure. One of the advantages of the way we are governed is that almost anything can be created - though enabling legislation might be required. It is a matter of government deciding how, realistically, it wishes to achieve its ends. When that is done, Treasury rules and local government financing restrictions can be varied to accommodate the policy, as has happened often enough in the past. All it needs is the GLA and the central government to sit down together to design a workable capital funding arrangement for London. </p> <p>Stephen Glaister is professor of transport at Imperial College, London </p> <p><a href=\"mail to:s.glaister@ic.ac.uk\">s.glaister@ic.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "Pakistan will hold one of the world's biggest defence shows later this month, making its first attempt to break into the lucrative international arms export market. <p>The military government hopes to sell tanks and ammunition to countries such as Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Indonesia and Malaysia, and administrative bodies such as the Palestinian Authority.</p> <p>At least 34 countries with a combined arms budget of $20bn (\u00a313.8bn) will send delegations to the four-day \"Arms for Peace\" exhibition in Karachi.</p> <p>\"The delegations coming are for business.

  "I voted this week. I dug through a pile of papers to find my absentee ballot, scribbled a quick \"x\", and jammed the forms into an envelope before I could change my mind. It was very exciting. It was very painful. I voted for Ralph Nader for president of the United States. <p>It wasn't an easy decision. The person I realistically want to win the election is Al Gore. And if he loses to Bush, a Catholic sense of guilt inherited from my father (minus the actual Catholicism) will leave me feeling that I am personally responsible. But even if Bush becomes our next president, I do not believe my vote will have been wasted. Nader's candidacy will have left an indelible mark on the American political script. </p> <p>It was thanks to Nader that I started paying attention to the elections. I spent the early months of the race doing my damnedest to avoid it. I refused to vote in the primaries. </p> <p>Then I heard this summer that the Green party was running a candidate and that he was doing pretty well. I started looking for election stories. I scanned magazines for profiles of Nader. What I found, to my great relief, was someone echoing some of my own concerns - reasserting the supremacy of democracy over capitalism, universal health care, support for trade unions - and being taken seriously. By September, when I went back to the States for a visit, I was determined to register for an absentee ballot. </p> <p>Voting for Nader felt like a tiny step into a broader movement, an act that connected me with protesters in Seattle and Prague. While I was in the States I gave the Greens a small donation, my first to a political party. Just for good measure, I also gave a little to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Hardly revolutionary acts, but they are a modest start and far more than Gore could have inspired me to. </p> <p>The last time I was this excited about voting was in 1992 when Bill Clinton was first running for president, promising to end what seemed, from my 20-year-old perspective, like an endless Republican reign in the White House. I imagined Clinton would throw open the White House doors and let a fresh breeze of liberalism air out a stale den of conservatism. </p> <p>Then came the don't ask, don't tell policy. Then the collapse of the health-care project. Then welfare reform. Then Monica Lewinsky. It became obvious that Clinton is not a champion of the left, but a page boy for a nebulous centre. </p> <p>Just because you're enthusiastic about the person you're voting for, it doesn't mean you'll get a fairytale ending. Idealistic voting doesn't always work. Gore's supporters won't let us forget that. \"A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush,\" they shout, like it's a campaign slogan. There's some truth to that. If Nader weren't around and the race was still this close I might have been frightened into voting for Gore. But what is the value of a vote cast out of fear? </p> <p>The Democrats are treating their liberal supporters as though the only thing they have to do to earn our votes is conjure up the spectre of a Republican presidency. That's not enough. My vote is my power as a citizen of a democracy. If I allow the Democratic party to convince me that I have no choices at the polling booth, then I allow them to strip me of that power. The only way to make the Democratic leadership pay attention is by showing them I can take my vote elsewhere. The wonderful thing about this election is that liberal Americans have finally been offered an elsewhere. </p> <p>It's not easy to vote for Nader. The potential consequences are serious. But then, it only matters when it hurts. What are the \"a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush\" people trying to suggest? That you should support a third party only if it has no impact on the race whatsoever? What would be the point then? For the ideas that Nader and the Green party represent to have an impact, it's got to sting a little. </p> <p>That sting is already making a difference. Gore has been forced to acknowledge Nader's presence. With enough votes, maybe Nader and the Greens can keep that momentum going, get the left organised again into a more viable political force. </p> <p>Or we could simply vote for the lesser of two evils. But then we shouldn't be surprised if we always end up with evil. I think it's worth giving idealism another try. </p> <p>\u0095 Tara Mack is an American journalist based in London </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Right, have I got everything? Plenty of wood for the fire; black coffee; snacks; matches (for lighting up if it's tense, for propping open eyelids if it's boring); whisky for drowning sorrows (probably); pens; map of the United States for colouring in the results, TV doofer (where's it hidden THIS time, then?) to switch to CNN if the BBC gets really irritating . . . <p>No, I'm not sad; perfectly happy, actually. I love election nights, whenever and wherever. The psephologist David Butler once said that, for him, they were the equivalent of cup finals. In the case of American elections, the analogy is an exact one for us ballot-omanes. We don't really have a direct interest but pick a team anyway, and pretend we're really bothered. </p> <p>An American election has to be second-best to our own because no other country - it is a small British boast - gets the comedy-drama of election night as right as we do. We cannot reasonably expect to see anything on TV in the early hours of tomorrow as cathartic as the eclipse of Portillo. Nor will the next leader of the United States have to stand next to a defeated candidate with a bucket on his head, as John Major did when the Huntingdon result was declared in 1992. </p> <p>Indeed, we will not see any results being announced at all. Screeds will appear on the screen, announcing that 3% of the precincts have been counted in Mississippi or somewhere; network analysts will crunch the numbers and then hand Mississippi to Bush. If it's close, it may take longer. But the human factor will be absent. This may be one reason why less than half of US adults vote, compared to 75% in Britain. </p> <p> Close votes are the best, no matter what the occasion. The tension in the final stages of the referendum on Welsh devolution, when everything depended on the response of a handful of voters in Carmarthen, was mind-blowing. For an ideal election night, though, you need a closely-fought front-line battle and innumerable subplots. The problem with American elections is that the real subplots - ie the sub-subplots - won't make it on to TV at all. </p> <p>Most politics junkies like to pretend that their hobby is actually IMPORTANT, unlike sport, which is entirely TRIVIAL. But Americans long ago concluded (another reason why they don't vote) that it makes no difference who the president is. If elected, George Dubya could theoretically get confused between Russia and Moscow and, say, Rusholme and Moss Side, and blow South Manchester to smithereens any time after January 20 next year. But the world survived eight years of Ronald Reagan. Al Gore may be more clued-up about global warming. However, if he gets in, he will still want to carry Michigan in 2004, so he is unlikely to raise fuel tax much, even if Congress would let him. </p> <p>In so far as this election matters to Americans, it matters on levels way beneath our radar. The main election issue in Pawnee County, Kansas, (I see from the Great Bend Tribune) is whether large-scale dairy farms should be allowed there. Meanwhile, Louisiana is voting on Amendment 4, which would let local government hand over money dedicated to economic development directly to companies that agree to move to the area. The Opelousas Daily World is against it. Their world is a small one, but they ain't stupid. \"It will open the way to cronyism. Enough said.\" </p> <p>There is a fierce battle to be county prosecutor in Cheboygan County, Michigan. Tim MacArthur was appointed (by his ex-law partner, opponents note) when the job fell vacant, but now has to face the voters. \"My family has lived in Cheboygan County for over 130 years,\" he says, \"and I was raised here with old-fashioned values.\" A local cop, however, claims that McArthur knows nothing of criminal law while his opponent, Ms Mickey Castagne, is a tough prosecutor: \"The choice couldn't be clearer if keeping our community safe from crime is your primary concern.\" </p> <p>In North Dakota (says the Devils Lake Journal), Mary Eksteen is hoping to be the first Democrat to be elected state auditor since 1892. The Idaho Statesman tells us they do have a Democratic sheriff in Ada County, Idaho. Many Republicans there like Frank Walker, but their state party chairman, Trent Clark, is cross with them: \"It's one thing having a get-along go-along Democrat who works well with his colleagues. But Frank Walker is very partisan. He campaigns on weekends for Democrats. His kids put up signs for Democrats. Frank Walker will hurt us.\" . </p> <p>And so on and on and on . . . from sea to shining sea. We won't hear the outcome of any of these contests before dawn tomorrow. But some of these results might actually affect the voters - rather more than Gore v Bush. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk\">matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk</a></p>",

  "A schoolgirl yesterday took her estranged father to court in an attempt to force him to pay her private school fees. <p>Nicole Lavelle, 16, told Stirling sheriff court that her father, Callum, was happy to pay \u00a312,000 a year for her to attend an exclusive school of his choosing, but withdrew his support when she decided to go to a cheaper school closer to her mother's home. </p> <p>Miss Lavelle said that her father, who lives in Dunblane, near Stirling, told her that she must decide between a relationship with him and a relationship with her mother. </p> <p>As she took the stand, dressed in her navy school uniform, Miss Lavelle said she had tried to find equal ground between her parents when they divorced in 1998. But she could think of no other reason for her father's actions than the feud between her parents. </p> <p>She is suing Mr Lavelle for the \u00a36,600 a year she needs to continue her education at King's School, Worcester. </p> <p>If Miss Lavelle is successful, she will become the first child in Scotland to use the \"right to aliment\", which is contained in the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985, to force a parent to pay private school fees. </p> <p>The court heard that when Miss Lavelle's parents split up she decided to stay in Scotland with her father, a computer executive in Stirling. </p> <p>Initially the pair lived together in a rented flat. But the pressures of Mr Lavelle's job made him decide to send his daughter away to school. </p> <p>\"My dad said I had to go to a boarding school because he worked abroad a lot and there would be nobody at home,\" she told the court. \"He said it was in everybody's best interests.\" </p> <p>While her father stayed in Dunblane and remarried, Miss Lavelle studied at Harrogate Ladies' College, North Yorkshire. Although she initially enjoyed her time there, she became increasingly unhappy as she watched the day girls return to their homes each evening. Believing she was missing out on a home life, Miss Lavelle tried to enrol in Cheltenham Ladies' College so that she could be on \"neutral ground\" with her parents. </p> <p>She told the court that she planned to spend weekends with her mother and sister in Peopleton, near Worcester, and longer breaks with her father. The court heard that her father was amenable to this, but then he visited her at Harrogate and told her he had changed his mind. </p> <p>She said her father gave her an ultimatum; she could stay at Harrogate or have a relationship with her mother and never see him again. </p> <p>She said her father, who is reported to earn \u00a385,000, told her that he had been contacted by the Child Support Agency. \"He told me that people who were contacted by the Child Support Agency committed suicide,\" she added. It was at this point that Miss Lavelle moved to the school closer to her mother, Belinda, with whom she now lives. </p> <p>Later, Mr Lavelle told the court he had initially agreed that he would fund his children through boarding school. </p> <p>\"I simply cannot meet the regular fees for private education at this moment in time,\" he said. The court's decision will be issued within 28 days.</p>",
  "A young man in tracksuit bottoms and grubby trainers is slumped against a wall. In his hands is a piece of cardboard with the scrawled words: \"If you really want to help me, call Change a Life 0845 60 61 62 3\" <p>Mo Mowlam, the Cabinet Office minister, standing beside the posters to launch the government's campaign on begging, kept urging photographers to \"get the number\". </p> <p>But other numbers were preoccupying the media yesterday. The Express trumpeted \"startling links between begging and crime\" - unpublished government figures said that 75% of arrested beggars had criminal records, it claimed. The BBC reported another figure: 86% of rough sleepers were drug users, it said. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Shelter, which declined to take part in the government campaign, said: \"If we are told that this isn't an anti-begging campaign, then why were two hardline figures leaked to the media in advance of full publication of the research ? </p> <p>\"They did not leak the one that said over a third of people are looking for assistance with a drug problem, or issues about family breakdown in the background, or about finding accommodation.\" </p> <p>It was not surprising that many homeless people have criminal records, the spokeswoman said, as the problems of housing ex-prisoners were well-known. As for drugs, the government research quoted by the BBC was less dramatic than the bald figure suggests. While 86% of rough sleepers reported some drug-taking, only 57% were \"problem drug users\" who regularly abused a hard drug. </p> <p>Launching the Change a Life campaign yesterday, Ms Mowlam insisted that the government was not telling people not to give. \"It's rubbish that we are telling people not to give. We are saying, If you want to give, please give. But if you want to give in a way that will change a life, think again.\" </p> <p>The \u00a3240,000 advertising campaign will encourage the public to donate to a fund split equally between four homeless charities - Centrepoint, Crisis, the National Homeless Alliance, and the Salvation Army. </p> <p>Ms Mowlam and Louise Casey, director of the Rough Sleepers Unit, spoke of the hold that drug dealers have on the homeless. </p> <p>\"Every time I walk home from the House of Commons after a late vote, I walk down the Strand where I see the homeless being hassled by pushers,\" Ms Mowlam said. \"If someone on the streets isn't an addict, they will be.\" </p> <p>Shelter has warned that discouraging giving to beggars could lead to an increase in crime. In some parts of the country there is a waiting time of up to six months for rehabilitation, it says. </p> <p>Shaks Ghosh, chief executive of Crisis, was keen to see the debate shift away from the controversy over begging. \"The campaign must be part of a wider response and much more needs to be done to help people battling drink or drug problems.\"</p>",
  "Jimmie Davis, who has died at the reputed age of 101, stood largely alone in the murky world of Louisiana politics. The apparent author of one of the world's best known songs, You Are My Sunshine, he twice served as state governor. At last year's celebration of his 100th birthday, one of his successors, Edwin Edwards - who spent most of his final term on trial for corruption - paid an awed tribute. \"Just imagine,\" he said, \"Jimmie served two terms as governor and was never indicted. That's a genuine achievement.\" It was also a pretty close-run thing. <p>Yet, in the appalling political culture established by the Long family, Davis's legislative record was surprisingly benign. In a state still described as \"America's banana republic\", suffering some of the country's highest cancer, Aids and premature death rates, he introduced free school milk, accelerated hospital building, special care for the mentally ill and 6,000 miles of new roads. </p> <p>Davis claimed, at different times, to have been born in any year from 1899 to 1902. As sharecroppers in north Louisiana's cottonfields, his parents jammed 12 children into a two-roomed shack, and remained uncertain of the order of their birth. Davis said he had never slept in a bed until he was nine, and recalled a Christmas gift the children once received - a skinned blackbird and a dried pig's bladder. \"We ate the bird, and played ball with the bladder. I've never been happier with anything I've had since.\" </p> <p>Davis studied hard, at primary school, high school, and Louisiana College, graduating in education. After a year teaching at his old primary school, he enrolled at Louisiana state university for a master's degree. Throughout this period, he also pursued his musical career. </p> <p>In 1929, he became clerk to Shreveport city court. Huey Long had just become governor of Louisiana, exerting his demagogic power and offering his share-the-wealth policy of social services and vast public works - which were mostly a mechanism to siphon off huge sums for himself. For 10 years, Davis quietly consolidated his own political career, combining it with increasing popularity as a singer. In 1938, he won his first election, becoming commissioner of public safety for Shreveport - controlling the police and fire services. </p> <p>He soon moved to the state public service commission, a body at the heart of the Long family's financial shenanigans. From this key position, he emerged as the likeliest figure to unite the state's bitterly feuding political factions, the Long family and those they had ousted from their lucrative state pickings. </p> <p>In 1944, with most of America's attention fixed on the second world war, Davis launched one of the most eccentric gubernatorial campaigns in US history. Relying on his musical reputation, he took his band across the state, concentrating primarily on giving the crowds a good time - and romped into the governor's mansion. </p> <p>One of his first acts was to introduce driving licences to a population which had never thought them necessary. Though he successfully advanced the social measures being advocated nationally by his old ally President Truman, he was criticised for frequent absences from the office, not least to star in a 1947 Hollywood film about his own life. </p> <p>Unable, under state law, to succeed himself, he concentrated throughout the 1950s on a musical career. But in 1960, with the explosive issue of desegregation filling the political horizon, he was again elected governor as a compromise candidate. </p> <p>Davis then seemed to act as just another redneck bigot, calling five special sessions of the state legislature to combat federal desegregation orders, and eventually seeing this rearguard campaign struck down by the US supreme court. He later justified his actions on the grounds that they offered the least bad option. \"Everybody ran on the segregation ticket. You couldn't be elected without it. When desegregation came, we did it without having anybody killed. We didn't even have a fist-fight\". </p> <p>His first wife died in 1968. He is survived by his second wife, Anna, and a son. </p> <p> <b>Tony Russell writes:</b> Jimmie Davis always maintained that You Are My Sunshine was his bright idea. When reminded that other artists had recorded the song before him, he invented even earlier sessions at which, he claimed, he had recorded it, but, unsatisfied, vetoed its release. </p> <p>The truth seems to be that Davis bought the song for $35 from a musician who needed to pay his wife's hospital bills. Its brilliance all but conceals a period when Davis specialised in suggestive songs like Jelly Roll Blues and Tom Cat And Pussy Blues. </p> <p> He began singing in quartets at college, and in 1927-28 had a radio programme on station KWKH in Shreveport. His first records were sentimental cowboy songs, then came raunchy narrative blues, such as She's A Hum Dum Dinger From Dingersville or Bear Cat Mama From Horners Corners, decorated with mellifluous yodelling in the style of the contemporary country singer, Jimmie Rodgers. </p> <p>Davis sang blues, and associated with blues people; unusually for the period, he was accompanied on record by African-Americans, the guitarists Ed Schaffer and Oscar Woods. In 1934, he recorded the wheedling love song Nobody's Darlin' But Mine. A crossover hit before the term was coined, it was covered by Bing Crosby and in Britain by Ambrose's orchestra. </p> <p>Thereafter, Davis turned his back on the blues, but did not sever his low-life connections. As commissioner for public safety, he put his bandleader and other musicians on the local payroll and, many contemporaries believe, used his position as police chief to drop charges against arrested musicians if they signed over the rights to their songs. </p> <p>Certainly, the catalogue of songs credited, or part-credited, to Davis includes many to which his claim is legal rather than authorial. The country singer Floyd Tillman, half of whose income from his song, It Makes No Difference Now, went into Davis's pocket, told me with a contemptuous sniff: \"Jimmie Davis never wrote a song in his life.\" </p> <p>Until the early 1940s, Davis was a country music star of almost Gene Autry magnitude. After his first term as governor, he stopped playing in dance halls but continued to broadcast and record, now leaning towards gospel music. He sang from the stump in subsequent campaigns, but, when it failed to work in 1972, quit politics and devoted himself to his extensive publishing interests. </p> <p><b> Jimmie Houston Davis, musician and politician, born September 11 1899; died November 5 2000</b></p>",
  "In April 1943, during the latter phase of the Tunisian campaign, Lance Corporal John Kenneally, who has died aged 79, was a Bren gunner with No 1 company, 1st battalion, the Irish Guards, part of 24th Guards Brigade, when General Sir Harold Alexander ordered the final assault on Tunis. On Alexander's proposed route lay the German-held and heavily fortified rocky feature, Djebel Bou Azoukaz. <p>The 24th Guards attacked on April 27, but just failed to secure the Bou. Next day, the Irish Guards gained a foothold on a strategically vital, mile-long ridge. It was imperative that Kenneally's company - with fewer than 200 men - should hold their ground while further attacks were organised. </p> <p>Spotting a company of Panzer Grenadiers forming up below the crest, Kenneally took them on. Firing his light machine gun, he charged down the bare forward slope - and the enemy company broke and ran. </p> <p>On April 30, this time with a non-commissioned officer from the Reconnaissance Corps, Kenneally again spotted a German force preparing to attack. Both men charged and, again, the enemy scattered, but, on the way back up, Kenneally was shot in the leg. No one realised he was wounded until he was seen hopping from position to position supported by a fellow guardsman. He refused to give up his firing position. That August he was awarded the Victoria Cross. </p> <p>John Patrick Keanneally was not his real name. Born Leslie Jackson, he was the son of an 18-year-old Birmingham girl and a wealthy Mancunian textile manufacturer. He was brought up in one of the roughest districts of Birmingham, but his mother managed to give him a good education, at King Edward's School. By 1939, he was a Territorial army gunner. Transferring to the Honourable Artillery Company, he overstayed his leave and spent a period of detention at Wellington barracks. </p> <p> There he saw the Irish Guards, and, impressed with their bearing, requested a transfer. When this was refused, he simply deserted and joined up with a group of Irish labourers. Through them, he acquired the identity card and insurance number of a man who had returned to Ireland and, as John Patrick Kenneally, promptly enlisted in the Irish Guards. </p> <p>After the fall of Tunis, he was promoted to sergeant and, during the Anzio fighting in February 1944, was again wounded. Just as the war was ending, he joined the 3rd battalion in Germany. The life of the occupation forces was not much to his taste, so he volunteered for the newly-formed 1st Guards parachute battalion. After training, he went to Palestine, where he served with distinction in the last days of the British mandate. </p> <p>On his return to England in 1948, Kenneally requested a posting nearer his wife and family, but none was forthcoming, so he bought himself out of the army in July 1948. He built up a successful career in the motor industry, but always retained his links with the Irish Guards. </p> <p>With not a drop of Irish blood, Kenneally was immensely proud of being identified as a \"Mick\", steadfastly loyal to his regiment. He was a modest and unassuming man, greatly liked by all who knew him. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter. A third son predeceased him. </p> <p> <b> John Patrick Kenneally VC, soldier, born March 15 1921; died September 28 2000 </b></p>",
  "As a shortlived agent for the Australian Security and Intelligence Service (Asis) in Timor, Frank Favaro, who has died aged 65, played a curious role in the 1975 dismissal of Australia's Labour prime minister, Gough Whitlam. <p>In 1971, Favaro, having visited what was then Portuguese Timor, bought a hotel there. By 1974, when the Portuguese revolution paved the way for Timor's decolonisation, his family were residents and, in March 1975, he was recruited by Asis. Garrulous, and well-known locally, he was an unlikely agent. </p> <p>As the nationalist Fretilin party gained control, Favaro negotiated with them on the evacuation of Australians, was in contact with the Indonesians and assisted the media mogul Kerry Packer land by boat. During the 1975 civil war, he organised evacuations, visited prisons and appealed to Fretilin to cease beating prisoners. Besieged at Maubisse hotel, he made Molotov cocktails and instructed staff: \"If those bloody savages come over those walls, just light the blooming wick and throw.\" He was fired by Asis in late September 1975. </p> <p>In October 1975, Favaro's Asis file was leaked, but foreign minister Don Willesee denied that the businessman was on the intelligence payroll. When Whitlam discovered this was false, he blamed Asis director Bill Robertson and fired him. Favaro, interviewed last August, claimed that, when Asis recruited him, he had been told he was directly answerable to Whitlam. </p> <p>In November 1975, Governor-General John Kerr dismissed Whitlam. The new Liberal prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, said that the Robertson sacking was \"a powerful argument that Whitlam was not fit to govern\". </p> <p>Born in Australia of Italian immigrants, Favaro's early years were marked by hardship. He went to primary school in Darwin, worked as a mechanic and later built up a successful Fiat dealership in the city. He is survived by his wife Margaret, whom he married in 1955, and five children. </p> <p> <b> Frank Favaro, intelligence agent, born June 21 1935; died October 2 2000</b> </p>",
  "Dr Ambrose King, who has died aged 98, will be best remembered for modernising the study and treatment of venereology in the United Kingdom, which is a role model of care worldwide. <p>Ambrose was born in Hackney, east London. He and his brother were educated by the Jesuit Fathers at St Ignatius College, Stamford Hill. Ambose admired their self-abnegation, dedication and teaching abilities, qualities he shared. He followed his brother to study medicine at the London hospital (now the Royal London) and qualified in 1924. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1929, again following in his brother's footsteps. </p> <p>However, Ambrose decided against surgery and considered specialising in venereal diseases - then described as \"diseases of gentlemen's lavatories\". Following the first world war, venereal disease services in many hospitals were divided into two groups - one, dealing with syphilis, which was managed by skin specialists, and the second, dealing with gonorrhoea, managed by urologists. It was the latter group that sparked Ambrose's interest. </p> <p>In those days, the London county council was responsible for the venereal service provided by the London hospital. Unhappy with the split arrangement, it pressurised the hospital to provide a fulltime venereal disease service. It took courage to enter this unpopular speciality; resources were sparse, the standards of care were often poor, and staff were held in low esteem, coming in for such ribald titles as \"pox doctors\". The situation was aggravated by the perception that patients should be seen in rundown premises, tucked away from the mainstream of clinical care. </p> <p>Against this background, in 1930, Ambrose became one of the chief assistants at the London hospital's new venereal disease service. With dedication and compassion, he strove for better facilities, and was appointed as director of the London's venereal diseases department, and later senior physician, in 1945. </p> <p>Ambrose had married in 1931 and, in 1939, he and his wife, Susannah, were commissioned into the Territorial army. During the war, she served as camp commandant with emergency services in the London blitz, while his expertise was seized upon by the War Office and the US government, as venereal diseases were causing manpower shortage and hampering the war effort. He became officer-in-charge, venereal diseases division, at the Victoria hospital, Netley, and specialist in venereal diseases to the TA's southern command, reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel. </p> <p>During his career, Ambrose wrote a standard textbook, Venereal Diseases (with Claude Nicol and, later, Philip Rodin), which was used worldwide, and produced the first edition of the Recent Advances In Venereal Diseases series. He was an excellent teacher and trained a new generation of venereologists at the London hospital; he brought distinction to the department, which is now aptly named the Ambrose King Centre. He also established a training programme in Johns Hopkins hospital, Baltimore. </p> <p>From 1959-69, he was consultant adviser in venereal diseases, first to the Ministry of Health and then to the Department of Health and Social Security. It was a widely held - though erroneous - view in the 1950s that the arrival of penicillin and other antibiotics would lead to the disappearance of venereal diseases. But Ambrose believed that, because of human nature, more than the ready availability of antibiotics would be required to control venereal diseases. This was a prophetic warning in the light of the increase in sexually transmitted diseases over the past 40 years. </p> <p>Ambrose ensured that venereal diseases services in this country did not suffer whenever government was tempted to cut expenditure. The continuing success of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV services in the UK could be traced to his effort, and those of subsequent consultant advisers. </p> <p>Ambrose King devoted his working life to his subject in a non-judgmental way. Despite his achievements, he was a humble person, with a deep religious faith and a sense of humour. He retired to his country cottage in East Sussex in 1966, and wrote a book with his brother, Strong Medicine: Doctors At Home and Abroad, detailing their colourful and productive lives. </p> <p>Susannah predeceased him. He is survived by a daughter and two granddaughters. </p> <p> <b> Ambrose John King, venereologist, born April 19 1902; died September 25 2000 </b></p>",
  "Children whose brains are damaged in serious accidents can develop into acutely anti-social teenagers after years of normal behaviour, doctors will reveal today. <p>But new techniques in scanning for the exact location of injuries in young people may help defuse the time bomb that later reveals itself in uncontrolled frustration and violence. </p> <p>The children could get extra training in social skills before the age they might veer into aberrant behaviour, researchers at the Institute of Child Health in London suggest. </p> <p>Prospects for future treatments of such children are being considered following studies of two teenagers. A 15-year-old was almost expelled from school because of his inability to control his anger and the threat he posed to classmates, while the other, by the time he was 17, had a criminal record for petty theft and problems with drink and drugs. </p> <p>The first was hit by a falling brick when he was four and the other was struck by a car at the age of six. Both suffered injuries to the area of the brain above the eye sockets and suffer from epilepsy. Their behaviour did not cause serious concern until they were 13 or 14, though they had relatively low IQs, poor memory, language skills and attention spans. </p> <p>The researchers, whose findings will be presented to a conference for the Society of Neuroscience in New Orleans, believe a key function of that part of the brain in controlling impulsive behaviour, and thus learning appropriate social skills, only emerges in puberty. It may be that undamaged parts can be trained to play that role instead. </p> <p>Faraneh Vargha-Khadem, who led the team, said: \"We may be able to identify such cases by brain scans following the accident. Not only might we be warned of problems but we may be able to correct them.\" </p> <p>\u0095The conference heard yesterday that a sweet tooth and an urge to drink alcohol may be two sides of the same genetic coin. </p> <p>Scientists have found that genes play a central role in determining preferences for sweet tastes and alcohol. </p> <p>The discovery raises the prospect of screening children for a predisposition for alcoholism by testing their desire for sweets. It also suggests there might be a way of controlling alcohol cravings with the help of sweets. </p> <p>The US scientists found that 19 pairs of twin brothers shared a liking for sweets and alcohol despite having different life experiences, indicating that the link was mainly genetic, and not the result of learned behaviour. </p> <p>The scientists now hope to design a test which can predict those at greatest risk of developing alcoholism.</p>",
  "\u0095 For all concerned by the disappearance of Heather Rabbatts, mayoral hopeful and rising New Labour star not long ago, there is good news. After making Lambeth council a beacon to the world as its chief executive, she left \"the worst job in the public sector\" in March to join internet company iMPOWER (that really is the spelling). \"iMPOWER will help you cut through the red tape and enable you to take control of when and how you deal with national and local government, and other public services,\" boasts the website. \"We are working to provide online access to information and public services, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\" What a splendid idea. \"Our first online application for fishing licences ( <a href=\"http://www.fishing\" target=\"_NEW\">www.fishinglicence.co.uk</a>), was launched on August 28 2000.\" And that's it so far from the front line of this online revolution. First reactions are encouraging: \"I am glad to see finally,\" says one respondent, \"that someone has had the sense to make fishing licences available online\". Finally. But why so long? <p>\u0095 Word arrives that the Sunday Express is still being published, and that its magazine has enjoyed a triumph. On page 4 on Sunday, the regular A Good Walk feature advised readers to \"take a stroll about Guy Fawkes's birthplace, York city\". An excellent idea. York is \"readily accessible by train\", after all. \"Cross the Ouse by Lendal Bridge,\" is one recommendation. </p> <p>\u0095 A Sun leader heightens concern, meanwhile, about alopecian editor David Yelland. Dismissing the George W Bush drink-driving story as an irrelevant smear, it declares: \"We hope you've noticed that the Sun doesn't rake over people's private indiscretions unless there is a justifiable public interest\". Not a shred of irony. In that same edition, penis size-obsessed showbiz hack Dominic Mohan reports that Ronnie Wood has fallen off the wagon. Doubtless if he came to the phone David could explain why an old rock star's drink problem is more in the public interest than a would-be US president's. He won't, however, and until we see the neurologist's report on residual damage from the subway door shutting on his Irish jig, we'll need to keep a closer eye on Old Slappy. </p> <p>\u0095 A fax addressed to \"Matty lad\", on Daily Telegraph paper and simply signed (as if from a peer) \"Henderson\", arrives at home. The author seems cross. \"What marvellous certainty you have,\" his Lordship begins. \"Petrol protesters are charlatans, the C of E is run by imbeciles . . . Stephen Glover is a bore . . .\" And so on. He's not pleased. \"When people see you waddling along Goldhawk Road,\" (a neighbouring West London thoroughfare) with that capacious arse hanging out of your pants, exhibiting that air of effortless superiority, I'm sure they can make up their own minds about you. They do.\" Capacious arse? If anyone has any idea who Henderson might be, and how he managed to steal Telegraph writing paper, do get in touch. </p> <p>\u0095 The C of E run by imbeciles? What a thought. You will recall the leaflet sent to those attending the General Synod later this month. Apart from warning them that November can be chilly and they should bring warm clothing, it also has information on accommodation. \"The Union Jack Club (Waterloo) is the cheaper, with a large restaurant and an even larger bar,\" it explains. \"It has tight military security and is hung around with tanks and pictures of VCs. An 'en suite' is recommended, as you may not wish to compete with paratroopers for the bathroom.\" Just right for those who need reminding to wear coats when it's cold. </p> <p>\u0095 A courageous bank robbery has ended unluckily in Lyons, where Jean Tournier was close to making good his escape with \u00a315,000 in cash when a customer dived and, in rugby tackle style, took his legs.

  "Serb inmates angry about poor living conditions and a possible amnesty that would apply only to jailed ethnic Albanians held talks with justice ministry officials yesterday, after a riot that forced guards to pull back to the outer perimeters of their prison. <p>The riot, in the prison at Sremska Mitrovice, 50 miles northwest of Belgrade, began late on Sunday at one of the jail's three buildings.

The far-right National Alliance, the descendants of Mussolini's blackshirts, suggested that he should stay in Naples.</p> <p>Mr Martone, a judge at last May's Cannes film festival, resigned last week after accusing colleagues and politicians of smears and intimidation. In an open letter to the mayor of Rome, he said that an \"infamous campaign\" had made his tenure impossible.</p> <p>His decision to stage a series of plays dealing with Islam in the middle of the Vatican's jubilee flushed out intolerance, he said.</p> <p>Blaming the board's two rightwing members, he said they were backed by their parties, which control the province of Rome and region of Lazio</p> <p>Walter Pedulla, president of the board, said fringe topics had alienated audiences and led to financial meltdown - a claim denied by the director.</p> <p>The four leftwing board members, backed by the city of Rome, were unable to protect him.

  "A proposal by the world's leading pharmaceutical companies to slash the cost of Aids drugs in Kenya is \"cynical and hypocritical\", the chairman of the country's Aids control council said yesterday. <p>Even if the cost of HIV and Aids drugs was reduced by up to 85%, as the \"big five\" companies - including Britain's Glaxo Wellcome - were suggesting, it would only bring prices down to European levels, and would make almost no difference to the number of people able to afford treatment, said Dr Mohammed Abdullah, after meeting representatives of the companies in Nairobi. </p> <p>Earlier this week the Kenyan minister of state, Marsden Madoka, estimated that the Aids pandemic was costing Kenya's barely solvent econ omy more than \u00a31.8m a day in medical care, lost labour and funeral expenses. In less than five years the figure would be almost \u00a317.5m a day, he said. </p> <p>Given that Aids drugs made up a only tiny fraction of those costs, the proposed price reduction could not touch the problem, Dr Abdullah said. </p> <p>\"If the international mafia - the drug companies - really mean business, they should waive their patent rights and let developing countries make the drugs themselves under their supervision. Kenya already has the capacity to make most of these drugs. It is the big five who are stopping us.\" </p> <p>In the west, anti-retroviral drugs have delayed the development of full-blown Aids by up to 10 years, turning a killer disease into a chronic illness. But in sub-Saharan Africa, where 90% of the infected people live, they are out of reach and unknown to the vast majority. </p> <p>Government figures show that up to 25% of Kenyans are HIV positive, but only 2% can afford the recommended cocktail of anti-retroviral medicines. </p> <p>At about 432,000 Kenyan shillings (\u00a33,800) for a year's course, the cost of treating all the infected Kenyans would exceed the national budget. </p> <p>\"Instead, our people are left to succumb to what doctors in Kenya have become adept at doing: simply managing their decline and death,\" Dr Chris Ouma of the charity Action Aid said. </p> <p>\"The ministry of health cannot provide the most basic medicines,\" Dr Abdullah said. \"It cannot treat malaria, it cannot treat diarrhoea, and it will never be able to treat Aids at any western price.\" </p> <p>The World Trade Organisation (WTO), which draws more than three-quarters of its members from the developing world, sets the patent controls that have, in part, maintained current price levels. </p> <p>In January Kenya must agree to extend its patent protection from the seven years stipulated in British colonial law to the WTO's 20 years, sealing the western pharmaceutical companies exclusive rights to anti-retroviral treatments for several generations of Aids patients. </p> <p>Dr Sophie-Marie Scouflaire, head of the Access to Essential Medicines campaign for M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), agreed that price cuts were not the answer. </p> <p>\"Price reductions are just a tool of the multinationals to try to stop Africa producing its own drugs,\" she said. </p> <p>\"We want to see patent law change entirely, to see all drugs produced locally or imported from cheaper producers, currently outside patent law. A Kenyan drug company has offered to start making anti-retrovirals for us for free, but our hands are tied by the WTO.\" </p> <p>MSF estimates that an annual course of anti-retrovirals could be produced in Brazil or Thailand for $200 (\u00a3140). </p> <p>\"Extraordinary means call for extraordinary measures,\" Dr Abdullah said. \"We must [re-examine] the whole patenting issue. If the disease continues unchecked it will be like exploding a neutron bomb in our country. There will be buildings but there will be no human beings.\"</p>",
  "<p>The recent report into the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) crisis said that the so-called \"Mad Cow Disease\" became an epidemic because of a farming practice: feeding the remains of dead animals to other animals. So would we better off if all British agriculture was organic? </p> <p><strong>What is organic farming?</strong> </p> <p>Organic farming avoids using any artificial chemical fertilisers or pesticides. Animals are reared without the drugs such as antibiotics and wormers which are used in most traditional livestock farming. All organic food production and processing is also governed by strict guidelines set down by law. Detailed records must be kept so that you can find out how the food got from the farm to your plate. </p> <p><strong>How do organic farms deal with pests?</strong> </p> <p>Organic farmers aim to make their soil healthy and fertile, and they grow a mixture of crops. They hope this will attract a wide variety of insects - such as ladybirds - and other wildlife which will benefit the crops by acting as natural predators on pests. Earthworms, and other very small animals or insects - micro-organisms - keep soil healthy. </p> <p><strong> What are the benefits of organic farming?</strong> </p> <p>The Soil Association - which controls organic farming - believes that this type of farming is important for the well-being of animals, the environment and humans alike. Organic animals can graze in fields, are provided with comfortable bedding and are not housed in cramped conditions. </p> <p>Surveys by government departments like the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) have shown that organic farming can be good for wildlife. This is because the chemical pesticides used in large-scale farming often destroy the useful organisms in the soil, and the helpful plants and insects as well as those which attack the crops. When the pesticides destroy natural habitats like this, it means fewer food sources for other animals, birds and insects. </p> <p>Studies have also shown that organic food has more vitamins and beneficial chemicals, for example iron or zinc - known as trace elements - than food not grown organically. </p> <p>Some of the pesticides used on non-organic foods can even be extremely poisonous to humans. Scientists have said what the safe levels are, but there has not been much research into what happens when pesticides are mixed together. </p> <p><strong>Would organic farming have prevented the outbreak of BSE?</strong> </p> <p>Scientists do not know how cattle first came to be infected with BSE, so it can't be said for certain that organic farming would have prevented the disease. However, in 1983, long before the crisis began, the Soil Association banned the use of animal remains in the feeds of cud-chewing animals - known as ruminants - such as cows and sheep. There has not been a recorded case of BSE in any herd that has been fully organic since before 1985. </p> <p><strong>How much of British farming is currently organic?</strong> </p> <p>MAFF calculates there are currently 540,191 hectares of land either in full organic use or in the process of being converted; this is about 3% of all the UK's agriculture. Consumer demand for organic food has risen for the past two years at a rate of 40%. But the estimated total of organic food sales in the UK for 1999/00 is \u00a3546m - only 1% of all food sales. </p> <p><strong>What are the drawbacks of organic farming?</strong> </p> <p>Organic food usually costs more to produce and so is more expensive than non-organic foods. Many people say that organic foods are a luxury. But traditional farmers say they could not produce the amount of food needed and at a cheap price without pesticides. </p> <p><strong>Could we produce enough food to feed the world's population using organic processes? </strong> </p> <p>The Soil Association says that Britain is already self-sufficient in many foods and produces more than we need in others. Farmers sometimes throw milk away to avoid producing more than they are allowed to by the government. </p> <p>European Union agricultural legislation has led to \"butter and beef mountains\" of surplus food. The EU also believes the world already produces enough food to feed the population of the planet. The truth behind famine and hunger is that not everybody has equal access to land, Europe's ministers believe. </p> <p>Farming systems which aim to be self-sufficient offer the best hope for the future, they say. But those against organic farming argue that this is not realistic. They think that if developing countries converted to organic farming now, then food shortages would be even worse. </p> <p><strong>Curriculum links:</strong> <br>KS3 food technology, geography and PHSE.</p> <p><strong>More information:</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org.uk\">The Soil Association</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bseinquiry.gov.uk\"> The BSE report</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nfu.org.uk\">The National Farmers' Union</a> </p> <p> \u0095 First Edition is a current affairs series for schools on C4 presented this week by Phil Gayle and produced in association with Guardian Education.

  "<p>I had a strange experience last night. I saw people in a different light. Or rather I didn't see people. I had gone back to college to retrieve my glasses, having put them down somewhere and then gone home without them. I don't know how I managed to do that, but that is not the point. The point is that I became a voyeur, if only a blurred and reluctant one. </p> <p>I should have realised that things were not quite right when I gazed up at the college building that evening. Each room contained a group of active students and an animated teacher doing things with an overhead projector. It looked like learning was taking place. I rubbed my eyes. This was not the college that I knew. </p> <p>I wandered through the building in search of my missing spectacles. I peered through the window of room 301, where only hours before I had been exploring a Hamlet soliloquy out loud to myself while my students slept. Now the tables had been pushed aside and an assortment of women in leotards were waving ribbons on sticks to a disco beat. </p> <p>\"Blokes like you need locking up,\" slurred a voice at my ear. I turned to face Travis, one of the caretakers. His trademark red bandanna, thick stubble and RayBans were for once a welcome sight. </p> <p>\"Oh hello. I need to get into the staff lounge,\" I said. </p> <p>\"No need to do that,\" smiled Travis. \"You can get an even better view from inside the stationery cupboard. After the tea break they rolls down their socks and does scissor kicks.\" </p> <p>\"No, it's my glasses,\" I laughed politely. </p> <p>\"That's all right, I got binoculars I can lend you.\" </p> <p>Travis disappeared as quickly as he had arrived. I decided to check out the cafeteria in case I had sent my glasses in on a tray to be washed up. </p> <p>To my surprise I saw one of my own students, Roxanne, sitting at a table nursing a hot chocolate and reading a book. She must have noticed me groping along the sides of the salad bar. She called out to me, but by now I was literally seeing double. Fortunately I guessed right when I walked over to the left-hand version of Roxanne. </p> <p>\"You haven't lost your glasses again?\" she said accusingly. </p> <p>\"What are you doing here?\" </p> <p>\"Evening class in English Lit.\" </p> <p>\"But you do that full-time during the day,\" I said, \"in my class.\" </p> <p>\"Do you have a problem with that?\" rasped one of the Roxannes. </p> <p>I made my excuses and left. In another classroom I caught sight of Kevin from Hospitality and Catering. Except there were three of him and one of those was circling the other two. Kevin appeared to be running an origami demonstration. Packed ranks of two-headed students were following his every fold and twist as a giant paper stork or tulip or Pok\u00e9mon character emerged from his clever handiwork. </p> <p>\"That's boring,\" Travis whispered into my ear. \"They got their socks down and they're doing cartwheels in 301,\" he gasped. </p> <p>\"I need the key Travis,\" I said. </p> <p>\"No problem,\" and he darted off down the corridor. \"I've found your glasses. They're down in the stationery cupboard. Hurry up.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hardly anyone disagrees that there is an urgent need to change the way UK universities are funded. How could they when faced with the facts? </p> <p>Public funding per student has fallen by 50% since 1980. Universities have responded by increasing productivity - we not only teach more students, but have also increased our market share of international students and raised the status of the UK science base. Nonetheless, the adverse effects of two decades of declining public funding are plain: </p> <p>\u0095 Academic salaries are low, compared with non-academic jobs and with salaries of academic staff overseas. Recruitment and retention of high quality staff is difficult and getting harder; even if they are attracted into academia, many of the most talented are easily tempted overseas. </p> <p>\u0095 Student: staff ratios have increased and average class sizes have doubled. </p> <p>\u0095 Notwithstanding the recent funding pulses via the Joint Infrastructure Fund, there has been a serious lack of capital investment over the last 20 years, especially when compared to international competitors. In 1995, the UK spent 0.7% of GDP on higher education. The OECD average was 1.5%. The US invested 2%. To increase UK expenditure to the OECD average would require additional public funding of \u00a35 bn a year. Neither government nor taxpayer are likely to make this a priority. After all, \u00a35bn a year could buy around 200,000 more teachers or 240,000 more nurses. </p> <p>No change in the status quo will also mean no funds for all-important new initiatives, such as e-learning and biotechnology developments. We will lag behind our international counterparts in these innovative and exciting areas. And if the reputation of UK higher education that attracts 200,000 international students to the UK each year is compromised we will quickly lose ground. </p> <p>The present system already falls short on other counts: </p> <p>\u0095 Although student numbers have more than doubled, universities are almost as socially exclusive today as they were 20 years ago. Just 10% of 18-year-olds from unskilled and partly skilled backgrounds enter higher education. For 18-year-olds from senior managerial and professional backgrounds, this figure is 80%. </p> <p>\u0095 The current system is incredibly inefficient. Government control over use of public funds grows ever more intrusive. This is both expensive and slows down the speed at which the system can respond to new initiatives (e-learning and biotechnology again). So a new system must not only increase funding available to universities from non-government sources, but should also reduce social exclusion and wasteful regulation and enable higher education to be more market sensitive and compete internationally. </p> <p>What is the answer? Several options are debated in the report, Funding Universities to Meet National and International Challenges, by Professor David Greenaway and Dr Michelle Haynes (<a href=\"http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/economics/funding\">www.nottingham.ac.uk/economics/funding</a>). </p> <p>But the only realistic option is to ask beneficiaries of higher education to pay more to provide it, although public money must remain a central part of the funding. Any decent state will invest in its youth. And the benefits to graduates themselves are huge. They are more likely to be employed than non-graduates, and they will earn more - on average \u00a3400,000 more than non-graduates over their working life. </p> <p>Enabling different universities to charge different fees for different courses, according to market demand and cost, would draw extra funding into the system. Even if the government set an upper limit on fees, the extra funding would be substantial. With, say, a fee cap of \u00a34,000, more than \u00a33bn extra would be generated each year. And the Greenaway/Haynes report suggests all universities, not just the old ones, would benefit. </p> <p>If students were able to contribute more by drawing on future earnings through risk-free loans to be repaid only when they could afford to, it would ensure extra income at no public cost. That is, providing the finance up front would also ensure no one was denied access because of cost. Another benefit of additional income is that universities could then start building up scholarship funds to broaden access further. </p> <p>Of course, these proposals need further development to ensure we increase funding and broaden access. But we cannot sit on our hands indefinitely. The competition is getting stronger all the time. </p> <p>\u0095 Sir Colin Campbell is vice-chancellor of Nottingham University.</p>",
  "<p>POWs, refugees and front line troops awaiting parachute drops come to mind when you hear talk of food parcels? Well, think again. Beleaguered students have now joined the ranks of those deserving emergency food aid. </p> <p>Late October is when the realities of living away from home start to break through the euphoria of fresherdom. With wide-eyed shock, students across the land, outside the safety net of catered accommodation, are coming to the chilling realisation that cupboards and fridges do not spontaneously fill themselves. </p> <p>So, it is with impeccably good timing that food retailer Iceland has launched the Save Our Students (SOS) Survival Pack - a scheme enabling parents to shop at a distance for their provision-challenged offspring. </p> <p>The idea belongs to Ben Dutton, a 21-year-old student of Spanish and public relations at Leeds Metropolitan University. It was while on secondment with Iceland that he dreamed up the idea. He suggested the company should adapt their homeshopping facility to create a standard set of student supplies. These could then be ordered and paid for from a parent's address and delivered to their son's and daughter's digs. Ben's colleagues were so taken with the notion that they gave him a budget and suggested he did some research. </p> <p>A thousand students at four universities - Loughborough, Leeds, Bristol and Brighton - were quizzed about their shopping and eating habits and what emerged would chill any parent's heart. \"Seven in 10 were receiving contributions from home towards their food, but 45% of the students we questioned were skipping meals,\" said Ben. \"This figure climbed to 78% when it came to breakfast.\" </p> <p>The survey revealed that many students were going hungry and resorting to bizarre food combinations as their supplies dwindled. Among the most unappetising concoctions were Weetabix with peanut butter and sugar sandwiches. Even more worrying was the amount students claimed they diverted from their grocery allowance for drink - 22 per cent of a weekly average outlay of \u00a329.82. </p> <p>Ben feels these curious priorities make total sense in the context of university life: \"A major part of being at uni, especially at the start, is about getting out and meeting people. Something has got to give and that something is often healthy food. The Iceland scheme is not promoting laziness.\" </p> <p>His view is supported by recipient of an SOS parcel, Liverpool student Gemma Davies: \"Students have to spend a lot of their money socialising. Anyone making food their priority and staying in all the time to eat it would quickly fall apart - it can be very lonely going away to study.\" </p> <p>The Iceland SOS initiative resolves these problems by bringing one of two standard supplies - meat or vegetarian - right to the door. \"For \u00a340, parents can send two weeks' worth of groceries,\" explains Ben. \"And all the student needs to do is be there during a pre-arranged two-hour slot to receive the goodies.\" </p> <p>The food parcels do not contain much that requires refrigerator space. And as well as various staples, there is room for chocolate biscuits and loo rolls. The venture - presumably designed to persuade students that Iceland is a hip, happening company and to educate everyone that their range extends beyond frozen cheesecake - is being well received. </p> <p>\"It's a wonderful idea,\" said consultant nutritionist Azmina Govindji. \"The worse thing is that students are missing meals - above all else they should be eating regularly. My one concern is that these set grocery lists might contain an unnecessary amount of salt.\" </p> <p>Beth Blackie, Gemma's mother, was full of praise: \"It's a great relief - you send them off with a full box of food, but you cannot be visiting them regularly to rummage in their cupboards.\" </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the SOS idea gets its highest approval rating among students. \"It's needed; people here are always skimping on food - there is so much else going on,\" says Durham law student Stephen Beattie. </p> <p>\"It can be nightmarish, particularly in the first year when you are having to juggle so many new demands all at the same time.\" </p> <p>Toni Dicks, a student union representative at Northampton University, said: \"This is brilliant - I hate supermarkets.\" </p> <p>Of course, getting a food pack is one thing, actually cooking it is another. Simple meal suggestions are included with each delivery, but the scheme is up against a lot when it comes to students' culinary blindspots. \"Many arrive at university with little or no experience of feeding themselves,\" says Leicester senior student welfare officer Clare Taylor. </p> <p>Her view is reflected in the tales of woe most students can report about disastrous attempts to prepare food. Durham English Student Emma Taylor tells of a flatmate resorting to a mallet in an effort to detach portions of mince from a large frozen economy block: \"The whole house was shaking. He never did manage to chip a piece off and the whole thing went in the bin.\" </p> <p>There is also no guarantee that students will spend the money saved on fruit and vegetables - still a rarity, according to the most recent Health Education Monitoring Survey, in the diets of over 50% of young men and 40% of young women. </p> <p>Such carping aside, there is no doubt getting a food parcel is a source of many pleasures to students: \"I spent four hours tantalising the girls I live with - unpacking and re-packing my box,\" said Gemma. \"And since it came, I have never been so popular.\" </p> <p>But, meanwhile, things are tight for Ben Dutton. He is back at college and his grant has been delayed. \"My food supplies have really run short this week, but my mum and dad are on holiday.\" </p> <p>A public service broadcast is needed: \"Will the parents of Ben Dutton currently travelling in America please arrange an urgent delivery of a food parcel - your son is seriously contemplating a sugar sandwich.\" </p> <p>\u0095 For full details of the Save Our Student Scheme contact the order line on 0870 242 2242.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Zhanara Begum </strong><br> <strong>Second-year student at Cambridge University studying English literature</strong> </p> <p>Zhanara is the model of a successful student. Bright, from a working-class background in the West Midlands, she passed her A-levels with flying colours and got a place at Cambridge. </p> <p>Educated in a state school in Walsall, West Midlands, a Cambridge education is a dream come true for Zhanara. </p> <p>\"Cambridge is absolutely great. It has broadened my horizons both intellectually and socially,\" she says. \"I've been able to learn things I wouldn't otherwise have been able to. I am having a great time.\" </p> <p>A hard-working 19-year-old, she is a prominent member of her department - both academically and in extra-curricular activities. </p> <p>An ardent fan of Shakespeare, she has already travelled around Europe with a Cambridge student theatre group performing the role of Paulina in The Winter's Tale. </p> <p>But life has not always been so good. Getting to Cambridge was an arduous struggle for Zhanara which had nothing to do with her academic ability nor the much-hyped elitism of Oxbridge. Like many female students of Asian background, she was almost prevented from going to university by her family, who were afraid that she might be \"led astray\". </p> <p>\"My family were afraid that I may stray from Islam. I would be going out with guys and be drinking etc, etc. This is why they discouraged me from coming to university,\" she says. </p> <p>Zhanara's parents were adamant about her not going to university, even though it was vital if she was to fulfil her ambitions of becoming a diplomat for organisations like the EU or Nato. Both strict Muslims, they were happy for her to complete her A-levels and then stay at home until they found a suitable husband. </p> <p>But there was a huge difference in the treatment of Zhanara's three brothers compared to herself and her three sisters. Her elder brothers were allowed to go to university and all are pursuing successful careers. </p> <p>Although it is a case of double standards, she says her parents' fears were understandable as in Asian households the reputation of a family rests on a daughter's \"decency\". </p> <p>With a passion for literature from early childhood, Zhanara struggled to persuade her parents to let her read English at Cambridge. In the end, her elder sisters stepped in to persuade her parents to let her go. She believes she was lucky - her sisters' persuasion and the prestige of Cambridge helped convince her parents to comply. </p> <p>\"Also, my parents trust me. I am quite religious, and they know I won't get up to anything un-Islamic.\" </p> <p>She believes it is this religious conviction that won her parents' consent more than anything else. They trusted her strong faith which they believed would keep her away from the \"immoral\" excesses of university life. </p> <p>At university she prays five times a day. All her friends at Newnham College are aware of her religious commitment and respect her for it. She even went to the May ball wearing her hijab (veil). </p> <p>Although Zhanara managed to continue into higher education, her three elder sisters, like countless other Asian girls, did not. Despite achieving better A-level results than Zhanara (two As and a B), they were discouraged from going further. </p> <p>In fact, it was the elder sisters' bitterness at not going to university that was the chief catalyst in ensuring that Zhanara succeeded. </p> <p>Although Zhanara's parents give her full support now, they say their anxieties are something that every Asian, or at least Muslim, parent feels. Her mother Sufia, a housewife, says: \"We are Muslims and want to live like Muslims. I don't want my daughters to move away from the traditional lifestyle. </p> <p>\"At university, students are exposed to alcohol, drugs and sex all the time. We didn't want our daughter ruined by such a lifestyle.\" Her worst fear is that of \"free love relationships\". </p> <p>In fact, she still hopes her daughter will settle down to an arranged marriage straight after her studies. She is not so keen on her pursuing a career after university. \"We don't expect our daughter to feed us. She should get married first, and then she can do whatever she likes.\" </p> <p><strong> Herpreet Kaur </strong><br> <strong> Second-year student at Brunel University studying multi-media</strong> </p> <p>Herpreet, 19, from Ilford, Essex, has to make the tortuous journey from the edge of east London to Brunel University on the other side of the capital every day. Like many Asian female students, she is forced by her family to live at home and commute to campus. </p> <p>\"It's frustrating. It takes me at least an hour to get to campus, but there's no other way,\" she says. </p> <p>Although her parents wanted her to go to university, they insisted it must be near home. Brunel wasn't her first choice, but she had to compromise. Her parents, who own a small retail business, were even willing to buy her a car so she could commute more easily. </p> <p>Her parents' fears are similar to Zhanara's. They just want their daughter to have an education, and not get involved in the university lifestyle. \"They want me at home so they can keep tabs on me. They don't like the idea of me drinking and mingling with boys,\" she says. </p> <p>Herpreet says she loves her parents too much to upset them. \"They genuinely care for my education, and they think that being at home I'll study better,\" she says. </p> <p>Herpreet's parents are especially cautious because they have seen too many cases among their friends and relatives where the daughters have gone to university and started smoking, drinking and going out with boys. </p> <p>But the over-protectiveness does not always work, as often \"what Asian girls tend to do is lead a double-life. They behave very restrained at home, but act totally wild at uni,\" Herpreet says. </p> <p>\"I know a lot of Asian girls who go to uni just to have a good time, because they know these are the only few free years they'll ever get. After that they'll have to get married.\" </p> <p>Although restricting girls from going to university is very common in the Asian community, to date there have been no investigations in this area. </p> <p>Bodies like the NUS and UCAS are unaware that the issue exists, and have no staff or resources to deal with it. One surprised NUS spokeswoman said: \"I didn't realise this was a problem.\" </p> <p>Indeed, most organisations believe the contrary - that more and more Asian girls are entering higher education. And UCAS statistics prove it. </p> <p>\"The number of UK female students from Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani backgrounds applying to university has been steadily increasing over the past five years, generally at a rate faster than the total female population of higher education students,\" says Anthony MaClaran, deputy chief executive of UCAS. </p> <p>But the percentage of Asian females applying to university is lower than that of males. For instance, last year only 947 female students with a Bangladeshi background entered university, compared to 1,102 males from the same background. </p> <p>Figures for Pakistani and Indian students show similar discrepancies, which contradict the national trend in the gender balance of university applicants, where more females are applying than males. </p> <p>Dr Zaki Badawi, principal of the Muslim College of Britain in London, says this is bad news for the Asian community. \"Educated women are a valuable asset to society. They are essential for the family as well as the rest of society.\" </p> <p>He acknowledges that Asian parents do stop their daughters from going to university. He says it is harmful, as it prolongs the oppression of women. </p> <p>\"There's prejudice against women learning in the Asian community. It is a form of male domination,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Often the fears of daughters going astray or becoming corrupted by all sorts of influences is an excuse to hide that prejudice,\" he adds. </p> <p>Dr Badawi, who has taught Islamic studies around the world, admits that Asian parents are right in fearing the \"moral decadence\" on campuses, but says they must trust their daughters. </p> <p>\"All societies have decadence. But it is up to the individual to stay away from it.\"</p>"
