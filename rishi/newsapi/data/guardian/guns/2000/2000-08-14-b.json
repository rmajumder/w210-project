  "<p>If you have friends who work in the university world, chances are they have been acting rather strangely over the last few months. Looking abstracted; muttering angrily to themselves; tearing out their hair. Another RAE - research assessment exercise - is coming up. </p> <p>The scheme came into existence a decade ago. What happens is that every four years, each university department the length and breadth of Britain is required to list the scholarship it has produced since the last RAE. Every member of the department is expected to come up with four items - ideally four books if you're a humanist, four better mousetraps if you're a scientist. The lists have to be in by this December. </p> <p>On the basis of the submission, an external panel grades the departments, creating gigantic sets of league tables out of the country's 110 or so universities. These are published next April, when the hair-tearing will begin again. </p> <p>Grades run on a seven-point scale. A handful of winners get glory and research cash (what's called \"R\"). They will, over the next four years, have to raise less of their money from student enrolments (what's called \"T\", or teaching). Easy street for the top departments. Hard times, however, for the many losers. More classroom grind. And those colleagues who let the department down (no four books) may go to the wall. </p> <p>The RAE was born out of the late Thatcher era, when some bright spark in Whitehall realised that competition and league tables were ways of getting quality without the pain of investing money (just as \"naming and shaming\" is a way of fighting crime without the expense of hiring more police). </p> <p>With the RAE, you simply told the universities to slug it out like gladiators. Last one standing was the winner. And the effort to beat the opposition (or at least get a higher grade than last time) would, it was fondly thought, produce improvement. Competition is the law of the universe. Darwin taught us that. </p> <p>It is a lousy system. Survival of the fittest may work for the animal kingdom, but it's bugger all use for tertiary education. Since the RAE was introduced, British universities have got a lot better at competing with each other, but have fallen behind in world competition - notably vis-\u00e0-vis their American counterparts. </p> <p>It's analogous to Association Football. Britain has the most elaborate and fiercely competitive league system in the world. It takes the announcer a quarter of an hour to trawl through the results at five o'clock on Saturday. And yet we can't beat Portugal. The problem that faces British universities is not that they have become fat and lazy, but that they have been starved beyond lean efficiency into inanition. </p> <p>Belatedly, the government has acknowledged the fact with one of its periodic (and pathetically inadequate) attempts to stanch the scientific brain drain. Four million pounds doesn't qualify as a finger in the dyke; you could find that much in the Dome petty-cash box. </p> <p>Competition - like whipping a horse - undoubtedly stimulates performance. But if you don't feed the horse, you can whip all you like. You won't have a winner (although it may do well against other underfed nags). </p> <p>There are worse effects of the RAE. It leads to a crudely quantitative view of research and \"productivity\". (\"Do you have your four items?\" colleagues will nervously ask one another - whether they're any good or not is a secondary consideration.) The war of all against all creates rivals out of natural allies. The scholars at neighbouring Birkbeck English department are not the opposition. But the RAE makes me think of them that way. </p> <p>It skews appointments. Many departments, under intolerable pressure to raise their grade, go head-hunting for stars. What they don't want is the young scholar who won't have any listable piece of research for 10 years. Long-term investment in human resources? Forget it. We want our five-star next April. Appoint Professor Trendhound from the University of Cutting Edge - even if you have to break the bank to get him (oh, and by the way, he doesn't want to do any teaching and wants you to find a job for his partner). </p> <p>Like the Ofsted inspections, RAE leads to human tragedies. Most departments will have colleagues who are intensely learned but for one reason or another don't write a lot. You can't cut learning into four listable items. Fire the bum - ah, Professor Trendhound, I do hope the red carpet was to your liking.</p>",

  "<p>These are truly interesting times for newspapers. At first glance, the link between falling sales, a new magazine distribution deal and a report by the National Economic Research Associates (Nera) on media ownership legislation may not be apparent. Two of them are a consequence of the insistent economic pressure on newspaper companies to adopt a more rational attitude towards global capitalism and, ironically, the third is the result of the continuing move towards monopoly in retailing. Those who live by the sword must die by the sword. Essentially, the result for the potential buyer will eventually mean less internal competition (less choice), greater consolidation (less diversity) and more cost-efficiency (fewer outlets). </p> <p>Let's start this dismal tale with the latest set of officially audited circulation figures and concentrate on the long-term trend. In spite of all sorts of massaging - price-cutting, bulk giveaways, cut-price subscriptions - there are many more minuses than pluses. In the six months from February to July, the 10 London-based national dailies sold an average of 12.72m copies, compared to 12.89m over the same period a year ago, 12.97m in 1998 and 13.21m in 1997. A loss of 490,000 copies over a four-year period is not a spectacular fall, but the fact that the downward trend appears to be inexorable, in spite of all manner of gimmicks designed to halt it, is very significant indeed. </p> <p>The British newspaper market is gradually shrinking, and that puts immense pressure on the weaker titles, especially at the inevitable arrival of that awful moment in the cycle when a downturn in advertising is accompanied by a rise in costs. </p> <p>Whether or not the three Express Newspapers titles are in play or not, they are among the most vulnerable. What they require is sensible investment and there is precious little sign of it coming just now from the current owner, Clive Hollick's United News &amp; Media, which is cash-rich after the sale of its TV interests. It is to be hoped that Hollick hasn't learned the wrong lesson from the Daily Star's excellent sales figures in the last couple of months. It has managed to turn itself around on a shoestring, with the smallest editorial staff and an absence of promotion. If he thinks the Daily Express, not to mention its poorly performing Sunday stablemate, would benefit from a further starvation of resources he will be in for a shock. However well the Star has done, its success is modest and no journalist working for it believes it has benefited from United's strategy. </p> <p>The two Independent titles are also finding it tough going, but their owner is in it for the long haul and shows no sign of raising the white flag just yet. Instead, we might ponder the fate of the Telegraph pair. It is difficult to understand what owner Conrad Black is up to nowadays. He has sold off titles in North America and has hinted about buying a provincial group, Regional Independent Media, here. His lordship-in-waiting can't be making a fortune from the Daily and Sunday Telegraph, given the subscription deals offered to readers: only 570,000 people pay full rate for the daily, while a mere 265,000 do so for the Sunday. Some 50,000 Daily Telegraphs are given away on planes and in hotels. Could Black be the first to crack when the cold wind blows? </p> <p>Incidentally, the decline of the Sunday circulations is even worse than that of the dailies. Using the same criteria as before, in four years the six-monthly average of the nine London-based titles has dived from 14.85m to 13.57m, a fall of more than 8.5%. </p> <p>Some papers are, of course, performing well, but the overall trend is clear and the dangers are obvious. When the bad times arrive, cost-cutting is also much more difficult to achieve in nationals than in regionals, which are solving the problem through consolidation. </p> <p>The regional industry's energetic and far-sighted mouthpiece, the Newspaper Society, is now calling for a radical overhaul of the current ownership regulations and the termination of specialist media controls to ensure that more mergers and acquisitions can occur. Rules largely drawn up in the 1960s are now considered to be totally inappropriate, according to Tim Bowdler, chief executive of Johnston Press, the fourth largest regional group. He argues, somewhat unconvincingly in my view, that the threat to the regional press from \"the new media\" makes it imperative that the government dispense with all regulation. He and his fellow owners (though not, it must be said, the smaller ones) have been supported by a Nera report which recommends that newspapers should be subject simply to general competition law. </p> <p>There are sensible changes suggested by Nera, such as some relaxation of cross-media ownership regulations. And to allow a complete free-for-all, treating papers like soap powder or baked beans and ignoring the special public interest reasons for producing newspapers, may be fine for those who believe the industry is all about making money, but it's surely against the desires of those of us who wish to enjoy continuing diversity. Logical, if ruthless, demands by shareholders for higher profit margins are inimical to the demands by readers and advertisers for choice in the marketplace. As consolidation moves forward, it is already the case that the largest 20 regional press publishers now own 84% of all titles and account for 95% of total weekly circulation. These are not bad companies and their senior executives are sincere in their belief that the benefits of size enable them to produce better quality papers. But the good in this generation may well not carry over to the next. </p> <p>Size, and the power it provides, is not always conducive to the public good, nor to the health of newspapers. A putative deal between two giants - Tesco supermarkets and WHSmith, the newspaper wholesaler - threatens to rob people of the opportunity of obtaining their morning paper. If the deal goes ahead, WHSmith will exclusively distribute magazines to all Tesco stores, overturning the current way in which 102 wholesalers across Britain distribute papers on a regional basis, a system which serves the best interests of buyers because they can pick up a paper at their local newsagent. </p> <p>It is feared that such an agreement would be followed by other supermarkets and then be extended to newspapers too. By choosing a single national wholesaler, the likely result would be a closure of hundreds of little newsagents. That, in turn, would mean people have to go to a supermarket for a paper and would also threaten home delivery services. This would threaten circulations still further, turning that gentle downward drift into a spiral. It's possible to see the Tesco-WHSmith plan as the natural next step in the erosion of the corner shop, an understandable development of that economic system newspaper owners all applaud. But do we really want it? Perhaps Mirror editor Piers Morgan, the greatest enthusiast for polling his readers, might like to ask them.</p>",
  "In a show of force in Kosovo, international peacekeepers swept into Serb-held Mitrovice early today to shut down a lead-smelter that was pumping toxic fumes into the air. <p>Hundreds of Nato-led troops cordoned off the 200-square-yard area around the smelter, part of the Trepca mining complex, in a pre-dawn raid likely to heighten tensions in the region. Vast clouds of black and white smoke belched from the aging chimney-stacks while Italian carabinieri and soldiers from France, Britain, Belgium and Denmark swept in. </p> <p>It was the most vigorous action in Kosovo by Nato forces for some time and was led by the French, who have been criticised in the past for failing to control the volatile city. Mitrovice, divided between Serbs in the north of the city and Albanians in the south, has repeatedly been the site of clashes between Serbs in the north of the city and Albanians in the south. </p> <p>Twenty-five miles from the provincial capital, Pristina, Mitrovice is one of the few in the province in which a significant Serb population remains. Control of Trepca has long been disputed between Serbs and Albanians, and Nato troops today took pains to reassure Serb workers that they would continue to be paid even while the smelter was shut for repairs. </p> <p>Peacekeepers - some wearing face masks because of the smoke - moved to within yards of the crumbling facility located in a predominantly Serb area before being stopped on a footbridge leading into the facility. After hours of negotiations, peacekeepers took over, UN spokesman Michael Keats said. Serb sources said that up to 800 Nato troops took part in the takeover, though Nato sources put the number slightly higher. </p> <p>The smelter is part of a vast mining complex, a collection of about 40 mines that produce gold, silver, lead, zinc and cadmium. Trepca is an emotional symbol for Kosovo, which is struggling to rebuild its economy after last year's bombing campaign. </p> <p>\"We were not surprised by this action,\" said Oliver Ivanovic, the Serb leader in northern Mitrovice. \"We do not believe it should harm relations so long as Serb workers are not fired and they do not try to bring Albanians back to the north.\" </p> <p>Last week, UN officials said that the plant was spewing pollution into the air, raising lead levels to 200 times the accepted World Health Organisation norms. But Mr Ivanovic claimed that the lead scare was being used as a pretext for the UN to take over the Zvecan plant. Though it was within the UN mandate to take such actions, Mr Ivanovic said that the Belgrade government should also have a say in the matter since the mine has always been under Serbia's jurisdiction. </p> <p>\"The takeover was a direct result of ethnic Albanian pressure on Nato troops,\" he said.</p>",

  "Britain today admitted that the tone of the country's recent asylum debate could encourage racial prejudice. The acknowledgement came as the government was criticised by rights groups at a UN meeting in Geneva to discuss racial discrimination. <p>Britain \"remains attractive to migrants precisely because it is seen as a tolerant and diverse society,\" delegation leader Sarah Marshall told the 18-member committee on the elimination of racial discrimination. </p> <p>She noted that Britain received 71,160 asylum applications last year, up 55% on the previous year. Although the government has tightened asylum policies, the Conservatives have attacked Labour for making Britain a \"soft touch\" for migrants and called for asylum-seekers to be put in detention centres. </p> <p>\"Effective immigration control systems remain the crucial platform from which more positive policies can be considered,\" Ms Marshall said, adding that Britain is working toward a more pro-active policy to integrate refugees.</p> <p>But she acknowledged that the tone of the debate may have stoked prejudice. \"There have been incidents of friction between local communities and groups of locally housed asylum seekers, and the tone of some debate around asylum has led, we recognise, to incidents of racial harassment against settled minority communities,\" she said. </p> <p> Ms Marshall said legislation introduced last year should improve the situation by speeding up processing of asylum claims. But a group of 29 British rights organisations said in a statement that the revised law is \"an example of where immigration legislation and policies have created racial tensions rather than racial harmony\". </p> <p>They claimed that Britain \"has failed to take adequate measures to protect the human rights of ethnic minorities, leaving millions of people vulnerable to discrimination, violence and social exclusion.\" </p> <p>But Ms Marshall defended government policy, saying that British authorities and police have learned from the 1993 murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence by a gang of white youths, and the failure of the police to investigate his death adequately. </p> <p> Ms Marshall insisted that extremist groups are \"not a significant part of the picture\" in Britain. \"The worst incidents of race-hate violence in recent years were the Brixton and Soho nail bombs last year,\" she said. White supremacist David Copeland was given six life sentences in June for the 1999 bombing campaign against minorities in London that killed three people and injured more than 100 others. </p> <p>The UN committee is meeting to review the records of some of the 150 states that are party to the 1969 international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination. Britain submitted a 72-page report - its 15th - to the panel, which is expected to issue its conclusions on August 25.</p>",
  "A Russian nuclear submarine was today trapped on the bottom of the Barents sea with more than 100 crew members aboard. <p>A spokesman for the Russian navy said that the Oscar-class submarine had \"malfunctioned\" while on operations in the Barents Sea.</p> <p>The vessel was not carrying any nuclear weapons and there was no immediate danger of radiation leaks or an explosion, said Igor Dygalo, head of the navy press service. The navy declined to give details on what had gone wrong with the submarine. The vessel's two nuclear reactors had been shut down, he said. </p> <p>The submarine could not move, but it was not clear why, said Igor Babenko, a spokesman for the Northern Fleet, to which the submarine belongs. </p> <p>The submarine, named Kursk, was built in 1994 and went into service in 1995, making it one of the newest vessels in the Russian navy. It is a nuclear strategic submarine that can carry up to 24 nuclear surface-to-surface missiles, used mainly in an anti-ship role. </p> <p>NTV television news, citing unnamed sources, reported that water gushed through the submarine's torpedo tubes during a firing exercise and flooded the front of the vessel. The submarine was trapped about 100 yards below the surface, the network said. </p> <p>Rescue ships were rushing to the area to assist the stricken submarine, which was in radio contact with surface vessels, officials said. </p> <p>The incident happened yesterday, according to Vladimir Gundarov, a submarine specialist at Red Star, the official daily newspaper of the Russian military. The depth of the Barents Sea ranges from 50 yards to 170 yards, Mr Gundarov said. </p> <p>In an emergency, a submarine would normally surface. But the navy said that the vessel had been forced to descend to the ocean floor, indicating that the crew had lost control. If the submarine cannot surface, getting the crew out could be very difficult, Mr Gundarov said. The crew may be able to use rescue capsules, but in the worse case would have to try escape by swimming out through the torpedo tubes, he said. \"It is extremely risky, but they are all trained to do this,\" he said. </p> <p>The submarine was carrying a full crew, navy officials said. The Kursk carries a crew of 107 personnel and weighs about 14,000 tons, according to Jane's Fighting Ships, a guide to warships.</p>",
  "<p>Joel and Ethan Coen first approached George Clooney with the script for O Brother, Where Art Thou? while he was in Phoenix working on Three Kings. \"I was nearing the end of a very tough five-month shoot, really ready to go home, and Joel and Ethan flew into Phoenix and handed me the script,\" recalled Clooney. \"They told me they'd written it with me in mind and asked me if I'd do it. I said yes without even reading the first page.\" </p> <p>Clooney had just ended his five-year run on ER to concentrate on a film career and was amazed the Coens had thought of him. Of their directing style he says: \"You think they're both going to direct at the same time. Then you discover they don't direct you a lot. They'll come over and say, 'Yeah, um, let's do it again. Yeah, you know. Yeah.' They play dumb a little, but they let you figure it out. In the morning you get the storyboard, so you know how it'll look. They're open to trying things, and you can suggest things and they say, 'OK, you can try that,' but they've already covered all the bases.\" </p> <p>The filming took place all over Mississippi and was followed by studio work in Los Angeles. It was completed in October 1999. </p> <p>When the Coens first talked to director of photography Roger Deakins about the movie, they explained that they wanted it to look \"brown and dirty and golden, like a period picture book of the Depression\". But when Deakins was told that the film was being shot in Mississippi, he pointed out that it was \"one of the greenest parts of the States\". So, to get the look that the brothers were after, the whole movie was digitised in order to take the green out of it. \"We gave it an ochre feel,\" said Deakins. \"I kept having to say to them: 'Just imagine it'll be all yellow.' \" </p> <p><strong> Scene 1: The chain gang</strong><br> </p> <p>The Coens are preparing the film's opening shot. It is of a chain gang of black convicts in faded striped uniforms, swinging picks in unison against rocks at the side of a road in the middle of the flat Mississippi Delta countryside. They chant Po' Lazarus as they work in the noon sun. </p> <p>A few miles from the location, scores of black extras are clustered in a tent in leg irons. Some are drinking Cokes, others are sitting patiently as a make-up woman smears them with \"sweat\" and \"dirt\". A few of them walk over to look at the storyboard titled Po' Lazarus Boys. Then a signal is given for all the extras to get up and file out on to a coach that is to take them to the location. </p> <p>The men arrive at the location. It is on a levee on the delta in about 100-degree heat. The production managers have to try to keep 200 people from dehydrating. There are little canopies to protect many of the crew from the sun. Ethan and Joel are wearing straw hats and sunglasses. Joel is wearing a grey T-shirt and shorts. Sweat is staining their shirts. They look along the line of extras like prison warders. There is a man with a gun on a horse patrolling the chain gang. </p> <p>Joel briefly explains to the convicts what they're going to do. The assistant director shouts, \"Playback!\" and the singing of Po' Lazarus fills the air, as the extras swing their picks, mouthing the words. Joel watches impassively. Roger Deakins, in a black fedora, dollies along beside them on a special track built for the camera. </p> <p>The assistant director shouts: \"Cut!\" The extras are handed water bottles to slake their thirst. Then the water bottles are taken away and they line up again to break rocks. Ethan grins to himself and strokes his ginger beard. He rarely speaks. The playback of the song, as well as the sound of rocks being hammered, starts up again. The picks swing in rhythm. </p> <p>Before the next take, Joel tells them: \"The rhythm really has to be on.\" \"OK, chain gang, one more time,\" shouts the assistant director. Nobody believes the \"one more time\". Suddenly she notices they are missing a convict. \"There's a hole in the line. We have an escapee,\" she laughs. \"Go without him for this take,\" says Joel. </p> <p>Everybody is drinking a lot of water out of plastic cups. While a crane shot is being prepared, Joel sits down in the shade on his director's chair, which is beside Ethan's, both of which are marked with their names and the title of the movie. Ethan takes over the direction for a while or, at least, he is indicating to some of the extras where to move. </p> <p>After another take, the assistant director shouts to the \"prisoners\": \"You can sit down if you want. We'll bring you water.\" Ethan, Joel and Roger Deakins watch the rushes on the monitor and laugh a lot. </p> <p><strong> Scene 2: The escape</strong></p> <p>The cock-eyed caravan moves on. There are wheatfields on either side of the road on the way to the next location. Sunflowers stare up at the blue sky. The team arrives at a burnt-out forest area. The scene, about 10 minutes into the film, takes place outside a lone farmhouse. Everett (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Nelson), chained together, are advancing on the farmhouse, which belongs to Pete's cousin, Wash Hogwallop. \"If your cousin still runs this-here horse farm and has a forge and some shoein' impedimenta to restore our liberty of movement\" says Everett, before a rifle shot rings out. On the porch is a grimy-faced boy, about eight years old, in tattered overalls, holding a gun almost as big as he is. \"Hold it rah chair!\" he shouts. \"You men from the bank? Daddy told me I'm to shoot whosoever from the bank!\" The trio convinces the boy, who turns out to be Wash Hogwallop's son, they're not from the bank. </p> <p>The team is gathered outside the farmhouse. Ethan is wearing the same shirt as yesterday, or rather it has the same pattern. He has a neat haircut and trimmed beard. Joel's beard and hair are unkempt, but he has changed into a clean shirt. Clooney, wearing a brown cap, is tanned, has a five o'clock shadow, a pencil moustache and grey streaks in his hair. They are sitting around talking and laughing with the Coens, waiting for the shot to be set up. They are called for the scene. Scene 12, take 1. The three cons walk towards the shack. Then Clooney misses a line and apologises. Joel pats his star on the back reassuringly. Clooney then goes over his lines again in a huddle with Turturro and Nelson before the next take, while the make-up girl makes repairs. Ethan tells Clooney he must talk like someone who enjoys talking. \"Yeah, yeah, got you,\" says Clooney. On take two, Clooney dries. \"Sorry,\" he says. Turturro and Nelson nod sympathetically. They don't have such convoluted dialogue. Ethan paces up and down. </p> <p>The actors gather their chains to advance on the farmhouse once more. They get through their dialogue without a hitch until the shot rings out and hits a bottle on a branch of a tree. After the fourth take, which seems to have met with Joel's satisfaction, Turturro asks for another. In any case, Deakins wasn't sure the bottle was in shot. </p> <p>Joel is yawning. \"Let's actually do a rehearsal in time. See how it feels.\" He has a word with the little shaven-haired boy. The boy grins. Joel shows him how to hold the gun to make it seem heavier. Joel knows about guns. After a rehearsal in which everyone is word perfect, the boy gets begrimed by the make-up person for the first take. The boy is great. </p> <p>A group of locals have gathered on a grassy knoll, many with cameras, to watch and ogle the short scene where the three cons come out of a store just as a man in a boater emerges from his car and enters the store. Everett waits for the man to disappear, signals to the others and they pile into the man's car and drive off. </p> <p>Perhaps there would have been less interest in the shoot if George Clooney had not been in it. He signs hundreds of autographs and poses with people for photographs. \"I grew up in a small town in Kentucky where they shot a series called Centennial,\" he says, \"and I followed Raymond Burr around everywhere he went. I know what it's like to see someone in person who you've watched on television or in the movies, and I don't get upset when people approach me.\"</p> <p>O Brother, Where Art Thou? premieres at the Edinburgh film festival on August 23.

  "<p>Volvo's V70 estate was already well-established and highly popular when, three years ago, someone at the company stood up and said, \"Let's off-road!\" And along came the V70 Cross Country - an out-and-out rural vehicle, with four-wheel drive and a thick metal rack on the roof to strap dead deer on to, and with the chunky look of those all-terrain vehicles which are so popular these days on the streets of, among other places, London. The Cross Country, now available in a revamped model, is essentially the V70 with lots of thick plastic cladding on it - in particular at the front end and around the wheels - so that you don't ruin your paint-job on the brambles, or, as may be, on the stray trolleys in the car park at your local Asda. </p> <p>No matter what people actually end up using it for, this is a vehicle built to climb every mountain, ford every stream - and probably to follow every rainbow, if you've got the time and can afford the petrol. It clings tenaciously to Tarmac, clay and riverbed alike. It perches 20cms off the ground, which ought to give the rabbits a sporting chance, and there's an aluminium plate bolted to the car's underside to prevent gravel, bull-rushes, voles etc from gumming up the engine. </p> <p>Test driving a spanking new clean model, with the whiff of freshly stitched leather in one's nostrils, seemed a somehow false or irrelevant experience - although a high percentage of the V70 XC's putative owners will, one imagines, keep the car neatly valeted and only go near gravel when it crops up on someone's drive. Clearly, though, the car's design insists that the wheel arches should be permanently stucco'd with mud spray. The interior should smell of wet dog and Wellington. And every time you turn a corner there should be an almighty clatter as various bridles, shooting sticks, discarded Puffa jackets, and maybe the occasional Young Farmer in a drunken stupor, slew from one side of the boot to the other. </p> <p>The boot, incidentally, is large enough to serve as a stable. Indeed, I calculate you could get a full-grown horse and two foals in there, albeit lying down and with one of the foals on top of the other. Alternatively, you can collapse the back seats and give the second foal all the space it wants. The V70 pictures a life exorbitantly stuffed with children, animals and skis, and then, big-heartedly, caters to it. (Which makes it, incidentally, very difficult to reverse into small spaces.) </p> <p>And yet it still goes very fast. I wasn't expecting what is, in effect, an elongated horsebox, to steam away so quietly and effortlessly. But I was forgetting that this is, of course, a turbo-charged, 2.4 litre, elongated horsebox, capable of beating almost anything its own size to the first jump. And, because Volvo think of everything, it has immaculately swift and unterrifying brakes as well, so you can steady yourself when the first jump looms unexpectedly fast. </p> <p>Thanks to some assiduous image cultivation, the word everyone directly associates with Volvo is \"safety\". Since the 70s it's what this famous Swedish company has been most famous and Swedish for, apart from selling fewer records than Abba. Volvo, we warmly agree, make a \"safe\" car. Of course, there can be no genuinely \"safe car\" in the absence of genuinely \"safe drivers\", and what is really meant by \"safety\" in this context is, more realistically, \"protection\" or \"idiot-proofing\" - slightly less seductive aspects from a marketing point of view, but appealing in their own way. </p> <p>Partly because of the received wisdom, but also because of the vehicle's patently obvious solidity, there is something uniquely reassuring about sitting at the wheel of a Volvo. You feel quietly confident that you are piloting the finest padded cell that Swedish research can come up with - a car with air-bags and anti-crumple zones in places you didn't know cars had places. In the V70, you feel strangely - perhaps even dangerously, which would be ironic - impervious. Pretty much whatever you hit in this car, you imagine, be it pothole or cattle, is going to come off worse than you do. </p> <p>Of course, what you're likely to hit depends upon where you drive and here Volvo and the marketplace do seem to be interestingly at cross purposes. The V70 XC is a car built to be up to its axles in slurry, but is just as likely to end up at ease on its tyres in Surrey. Its smoothness and peacefulness are a major corrective for anyone who thought all-terrain driving was about the thrill of feeling the uneven road beneath your feet and the underside of the roof on your head. Has the off-roader ever been so thoroughly pampered - so lavishly furnished with pop-out drinks holders and ticket clips and coin cubby-holes and directional air-conditioning nozzles (even for your passengers in the rear)? The driver's seat is electronically adjustable to fit the individual contours of your backside, and I don't think I have felt more comfortable in a car. I didn't set one off to find out, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least if the airbags were padded with goose down. </p> <p>Then again, maybe Volvo have simply been smart enough to spot how, for the motorist, the gap between country and city is closing - and canny enough to pitch a car neatly into what remains of the divide. Even in urban areas, the spread of traffic-calming devices makes driving any distance at all a kind of off-road experience and calls out for vehicles with big clearances and high-performance suspensions. How else are you to maintain a steady 55 through those humps and chicanes? Hell, these days, wherever you are, it's a jungle out there. The V70 Cross Country is your machete. </p> <p><strong> The lowdown</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Volvo V70 XC </strong></p> <p><strong>Price:</strong> from \u00a328,910 </p> <p><strong> Maximum speed: </strong> 130mph </p> <p><strong> Acceleration:</strong> 0-62 in 8.6 seconds </p> <p><strong> Consumption:</strong> 26.9 mpg (combined) </p> <p><strong> At the wheel:</strong> John Craven </p> <p><strong> On the stereo:</strong> Clannad </p> <p><strong> En route for:</strong> Iceland (the shop)</p>",
  "<p>For years there had been talk of \"the gap in the women's magazine market\". Everyone over 40 or so (think Jerry Hall, Helen Mirren, Mo Mowlam, Michelle Pfeiffer) still interested in sex, life, fashion, beauty and intelligent reading matter, thought magazines ignored us. </p> <p>But last May, amidst a fanfare of publicity masterminded by Brown Lloyd James, a new women's magazine arrived on the racks. Called Aura, it came from Parkhill Publishing, based in Grays Inn Road, its editorial director (who was also the chairman of Parkhill) was former Sunday Mirror and Sunday Express editor, Eve Pollard. </p> <p>It was she who garnered most of the publicity, despite being one of four partners. But with her flair, charm and high profile that was to be expected. Eve Pollard is married to Nick Lloyd, the former editor of the Daily Express, and the Lloyd in Brown Lloyd James. </p> <p>Aura was aimed at women who had long outgrown Cosmo and Marie Claire, but didn't feel the Good Housekeeping image was what they had in mind to complement their kitten-heeled mules and Agent Provocateur bra. Even if some of them were size 16 plus, warm, good women with two or three kids, in their minds they were Agent Provocateur material. </p> <p>A masterstroke by one of the launch editors, the ex-Woman's Journal editor Deirdre Vine, resulted, after endless transatlantic negotiations, in Aura's cover shoot with Hollywood actress Susan Sarandon - draped across the floor, arms flung back, hair extensions tumbling around her head, legs in the air, wearing a feather boa, fishnet tights and high heels. This was, perhaps, the first time an adult, intelligent woman had been portrayed on a cover looking really sexy. </p> <p>More than 100,000 women and quite a few men bought the magazine. They ignored the pedestrian layout and design, and once they'd read Germaine Greer, Fay Weldon, Leslie Kenton, Cherie Booth, Erica Jong and Paula Yates and pored over David Bailey's pictures, hundreds of them wrote and emailed. </p> <p>\"The writing's brilliant\", they said. \"The fashion and style are great\", they enthused. \"We love the tone, the honesty and it's not full of ads\", they trilled. </p> <p>The poignant confessions of Germaine Greer went straight into a double-page spread in the Daily Mail, arranged by Brown Lloyd James. Yes, they did overlook the um, little matter that there'd been no prior arrangement with Greer to sell on her story to the Mail. But it was great publicity for Aura, and something was sorted out with Ed Victor, Greer's agent. </p> <p>The June issue had pictures of Joanna Trollope - with legs in the air, wearing, er, fishnet tights and a feather boa. Celebrity interviewer Chrissy Iley wrote a blisteringly good profile and Brown Lloyd James again gave it to the Mail. </p> <p>Great for Aura publicity, but Iley fumed in Hollywood. Joanna Trollope and her agents were livid in London. \"I specifically told Nick Lloyd not to offer it to the Daily Mail because it would cause huge problems with my Sunday Times contract,\" says Iley. \"I did the piece for Aura out of loyalty to Kate Carr [ex-Sunday Times commissioning editor and one of Aura's launch editors]. She's totally trustworthy. I always sign a first rights deal for many reasons: it may upset the Sunday Times and also the person I'm interviewing. They may be happy to appear in a woman's magazine but hate the thought of appearing in the newspapers.\" </p> <p>Richard Burton, the managing editor, recalls that \"there was a bit of a fuss\" over Iley's complaint, but thought it had been \"sorted out\". </p> <p>More good names came thick and fast: Lynne Truss, Kathy Lette, Trudie Styler, Muriel Gray, Terry O'Neill, Edwina Currie, Roz Miles. Paula Yates started her agony column. Vanessa Feltz, four stones lighter, posed for swimsuit shots and wrote a marvellously humorous piece for the July issue. The Daily Mail loved it. It made the front page plus another spread for Aura. But Deirdre Vine, editor of Aura, was horrified as no prior agreement had been reached with Feltz. </p> <p>\"Vanessa trusted me,\" she says. Did Nick Lloyd care? Did Eve Pollard care? \"They seem to have a complete disregard for people's rights,\" says Kate Carr. </p> <p>Iley calls Pollard and Lloyd \"an amusing but sinister double act\". \"They lack moral courtesy. They're cavalier and arrogant. Celebrities who thought they were going to appear in a glossy woman's magazine could find themselves strewn over the tabloids like dirty knickers. I'm never writing for Aura again.\" </p> <p>But subscriptions were piling in. In their hundreds. But then on July 27, as the August issue hit the stands, Parkhill Publishing, which also publishes the well-received Wedding Day, told the staff the company was running out of cash and the directors were looking for a buyer for both titles. The staff were sent home and Eve Pollard got on a plane and went to her home in the south of France. </p> <p>There was an eerie silence from the press. Strange considering Pollard's high profile? \"Not strange,\" says Iley. \"Nick Lloyd is a fully paid up member of the old boys' network. Current editors always take their calls and do their bidding.\" </p> <p>The Evening Standard used its media page that Wednesday to promote Eve, the rather dazzling new BBC entry into the grown-up woman's market. The Times's media diary was cluckingly sympathetic about Pollard's media proprietorship. \"The staff of Parkhill have grown quite fond of her in the frenzied past few months and are genuinely sad for her,\" it said. One devotee (could this be a Brown Lloyd James employee?) was quoted as saying: \"A lot of people found Eve difficult to get used to, but she really is a brilliant journalist who deserved better than this.\" </p> <p>The journalists' trade magazine, Press Gazette, blamed those two old enemies, time and money. Oh yes, and the seasonal August slump and the money being spent on Red and Eve. Nobody attached the slightest blame to Pollard, nor the way she was running her company. They wouldn't dare. </p> <p>Brown Lloyd James, writing press releases and handling all inquiries, assured everyone that the \"staff salaries\" have been paid until the end of July. But there is a sea of freelance writers, designers, photographers, stylists, assistants, contributing editors, make-up artists and even the printers who've been waiting weeks and months for their money. </p> <p>Some are furious, some are worried sick, some are resigned to not being paid. They're people with mortgages, kids, money worries, commitments. They tend not to be people like Eve Pollard and Nick Lloyd with homes in Hampstead and the south of France. But it has long been a Parkhill joke that no freelancers ever got paid until it was absolutely necessary. </p> <p>Pollard has pledged that everyone will be paid and that there is enough money in the Parkhill kitty. Most people simply don't believe her. In fact, Burton explains that there is \"a large debt book\". </p> <p>This time nobody, except staff who happened to be in the office on the day the suspension of publication was announced, has even been officially notified. Contributors may have read it in the papers or been phoned up by colleagues. </p> <p>Aura beauty editor Sarah Standing says: \"Call me unworldly but I assumed if a magazine you were working on suddenly folded and you no longer had a job, someone would let you know. I'm staggered not to have a received a letter signed by Eve Pollard. This would never happen at Cond\u00e9 Nast. Her lack of manners simply amazes me. Particularly as I'm still owed money.\" </p> <p>Some contributors are owed hundreds of pounds, some thousands. When the suspension of publication at Parkhill was announced to staff, they were told to clear their desks and go within the hour. Many refused. One editor said they had loyalties to the people they'd commissioned to do work, they had their own professional integrity and reputations at stake. They'd called in favours and the least they could do was ring people and inform them. Pollard said, in a sudden burst of empathy: \"I know exactly what you mean. I feel awful that I asked Margaret (Baroness) Jay to write a piece.\" </p> <p>What, apart from a breathtaking lack of responsibility, went wrong? From the beginning, just about everything. In the spring of 1999, Pollard, who'd been unemployed for five years save for her novel writing and fellow director David Sinclair, a former financial editor and her deputy at the Sunday Express, went to the City for venture capital. </p> <p>\"Markets were buoyant,\" says former Parkhill group ad director, Fiona Davidson. \"They raised money easily from Phildrew Ventures. Eve is brilliant at marketing and self-promotion.\" </p> <p>Davidson thought the business plan far too ambitious, devised by people who knew nothing about magazines. It is true that the management team were steeped in newspaper backgrounds. Magazines and newspapers are very different animals. But it seems Sinclair was confident that his plan - a small company, the latest technology, a small staff with the rest of the work done by freelancers or people on short-term contracts and very tight cost control - could work. </p> <p>Certainly Phildrew was impressed to the tune of over \u00a31m. So Pollard, Sinclair, Jane Sproul from the Mail on Sunday and Charles Thompson from Granville investment bank were in business. Champagne corks popped, media pages took note and the Mogulette, as Nick called his wife, was back in the hot seat. </p> <p>From day one, according to insiders, Pollard thought of it as her own company and it went \"completely to her head\". The business plan was \"blown out of the water\", said one. She hired a personal PA and a \u00a350,000-a-year executive editor, refused to use the technology and wouldn't agree to hire anyone her fellow directors had chosen. She spoke of \"your people\" versus \"my people\". A typical Pollard speech would go: \"Look, I'm the chairman of this company. I'm entitled to get what I want. I'm sure Lord Rothermere gets what he wants. Tina Brown gets what she wants.\" </p> <p>One of her team says: \"Her ego went into overdrive. Board meetings were a shambles. She refused to allow anyone to set up a management structure. What shocked me about the whole enterprise was when Phildrew came in I assumed they'd keep an eye on management, which they utterly failed to do. They were so dazzled by Eve.\" </p> <p>Within six weeks, David Sinclair had left the company. In the spring, Jane Sproul and Charles Thompson also left. The previously gung-ho and enthusiastic advertising director, Fiona Davidson, resigned on May 15. </p> <p>\"Miracles had been performed by lots of people for the first couple of issues,\" she says. \"But you just could not continue with a complete lack of structure and no business plan. I was working seven days a week\". Parkhill couldn't admit to another senior walk-out. Nick Lloyd put out a press release to the advertising industry saying that \"the board has lost confidence in Fiona Davidson and asked her to leave\". </p> <p>Next, Deirdre Vine and Kate Carr, highly intelligent, principled editors, handed in their notices, though Vine did stay on as a part-time consultant and helped to recruit an editor - former You magazine executive Jane Phillimore - who was hired too late to start work. Aura didn't have a publisher, or an advertisement director. And there wasn't a circulation director. You couldn't make it up. Ab Fab meets Fawlty Towers. </p> <p>But a new managing editor, Richard Burton, was found. It has to be said that experienced editorial jaws dropped with amazement when Burton, a back-bench sub at the Daily Telegraph, was appointed managing editor of Parkhill and managing director designate early in the year. </p> <p>Considering that he had never worked full-time on a magazine in his life, and knew nothing whatsoever about beauty or fashion shoots, or page rates, or indeed anything that might have been in a job description for managing editor of a magazine company, you could say in fairness that he did his best. </p> <p>It's true that he had acted as a contract magazine consultant and had a little business experience. He worked long hours. He said no to everyone who wanted to spend money. As he says: \"I cancelled photo shoots and pulled out of a \u00a312,000 cover-mount to ensure that we'd be solvent.\" He went to endless meetings, interviewed new staff and he tried very hard to keep Pollard happy. </p> <p>Burton says now that when the circulation director walked out after a few weeks \"in retrospect, it was foolish not to have appointed someone else\". But he, too, insists there is enough for people to get paid and says it's his \"personal crusade\" to see that they do. He is a decent man who feels morally responsible for all the staff. He's given his home and mobile numbers to everyone concerned to know what's happening and has pledged to inform them and fight on their behalf. </p> <p>Kate Carr says there was lots of money when she and Vine joined Aura in November of last year. But it became obvious, once invoices came in, that they weren't being paid. Then it snowballed. \"No one understood magazines,\" she says. </p> <p>\"They didn't understand you had to pay writers even if you didn't use the piece. As time went by, I realised I was compromising all my contacts. I was promising writers and publicists things I wasn't confident I could control. I know it will be presented as 'Parkhill, brave little fish, against all the big sharks'. But it was so unprofessional.\" </p> <p>Phildrew finally installed a financial monitor at Parkhill. The words stable door and bolted spring to mind. No one ever doubted Pollard's energy, her terrific tabloid instincts, her gift for promotion and her ability to get people to do things for her. She slapped flattery on with a trowel if she needed you. But did she have management skills? </p> <p>One of her former fellow directors thinks not. One of her longest serving Parkhill editors says: \"Whilst on a personal level she could sometimes be utterly charming, her management style is that of a Sherman tank. Browbeating, bullying, intimidating and humiliating. She rarely listened to what you said and if she didn't like what you said, she'd put her hand in front of your face to stop you speaking further.\" Ex-director Sinclair sadly reflects that it was a missed opportunity: \"The way Eve treated people meant that team spirit disappeared.\" </p> <p>Yet Pollard is genuinely baffled by the attacks. Though unwilling to speak on the record until the company's future is certain, she did say: \"I didn't have a major spat with anyone. There was no time to have a big ego because we were all working so hard. It's so easy to target La Bollard.\" </p> <p>Burton, quite separately, agrees: \"Every editor and senior executive has their own style. When you work with Eve Pollard then you know you're going to get Eve Pollard. The problem was money, not Eve's personality.\" </p> <p>Pollard was disappointed by losing Sinclair but points out that he left the company because he wished to work partially from Ireland, which was unacceptable. One of the key problems, according to both her and Burton, was the failure to obtain \"secondary funding\". Pollard adds: \"Frankly, we just didn't sell enough advertising.\" Both are convinced that Aura could find a buyer very soon, proving that it was a worthwhile magazine. So far, only one subscriber has asked for her money back. </p> <p>Wedding Day has been bought, \"for a reasonable sum\" by Crimson Publishing. Its managing director, David Lester, discovered enough to realise that it is a viable magazine but he was less sanguine about Aura. Even so, it is known that when he returns from abroad he may well reconsider. One other potential buyer is also in the offing. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Burton says his phone rings night and day with calls from contributors, agents and former staff. Having generously made himself the only point of contact, he has also received solicitors' writs. Pollard, meanwhile, is back in the south of France. </p> <p>\u0095 Marcelle d'Argy Smith was a contributing editor on Aura. Additional material by Roy Greenslade</p>",

  "<p>* What a good job Charles Allen has decided to sort out ITV's web presence as a matter of some urgency. News reaches the diary of a very senior ITV executive who is embracing the network's new enthusiasm for new media wholeheartedly. Let's not mention, then, his early forays into what the young people call \"surfing\" back in February. \"How do I take a look at what this Martha Lane Fox is up to?\" he asked a more clued-up colleague. \"Just type the address 'www.lastminute.com' into the browser,\" replied the long-suffering subordinate. \"But it's not working,\" complained the senior suit, who had laboriously typed out the \"www.lastminutedotcom\" into his Internet Explorer. </p> <p>*Any journalists feeling frustration with the August silly season might like to check out a new website where hacks are invited to put press packs to their very best use ever - as airborne weapons against PR flunkies - in a web-based Shockwave game.

It must have been inevitable, then, that as the twin towers at Wembley are finally demolished, their televisual cousins are set to go the same way. For just weeks after Sir Christopher Bland assured the select committee that it had no plans to move Panorama or the 9pm news, Salmon now admits that some episodes of the current affairs show could be shoved off to BBC2 and the news shifted to 10pm.

It's a pity, though, that Sky types have never noticed that unraised screens and unbanked seating mean that half the audience can only see backs and heads; and that the unreconstructed 1950s hairstyle of BSkyB silverback Tony Ball, who topped and tailed the highlights tape, makes him look more like someone trying to sell you a telly in Dixons than the embodiment of the dizzying possibilities of the television of the future. </p> <p>*We do like it when our recommendations are taken to heart.

Imagine our surprise, then, to hear that discussions about such a possibility are indeed under way. If Endemol, the format owner, can be persuaded to agree a fee, we could be watching Nasty Nick's adventures all day long before the end of the run.</p>",
  "<p>Sitting opposite a sign on the wall of his office that reads \"The only safe thing is to take a chance\", and nursing a bottle of iced tea, is the man who could hold the key to the first US presidential election of the new millennium. Bill Hillsman, the maverick adman who created the \"best political commercial in history\" and who has been hired to run the presidential campaign of consumer advocate and Green party candidate Ralph Nader, is ready to throw some grenades into what has so far been a lacklustre race. </p> <p>\"We're really paying the price in this country for all these years of insipid political discourse and insipid political advertising,\" says Hillsman, sitting in the offices of the ad agency of which he is president in the Warehouse district of Minneapolis. \"Corporations are being blackmailed to give money. It's gotten to such a nadir that good people don't want to run for office any more.\" </p> <p>Hillsman is famous in the advertising business for masterminding the campaign that took the wrestler and Reform party candidate Jesse Ventura to the governorship of Minnesota and for a number of other imaginative campaigns for Democrats, such as Senator Paul Wellstone, that have made a virtue of operating on a tight budget. His very funny ad for Wellstone, which showed the candidate in pursuit of his embarrassed opponent, won the \"best political commercial in history\" award from readers of Campaign magazine. </p> <p>Around $250m will be spent this year by the candidates for the White House, with Gore and Bush each accounting for more than $100m. \"More and more money is being spent and fewer and fewer people turn out,\" says Hillsman, 47, a former journalism professor who comes from Chicago but has made his home and copywriting reputation in Minnesota. \"I'm not being paranoid, but the beneficiaries of this are the Democrats and Republicans, and the people who are in league with them. I've always looked for a term like the military-industrial complex to describe them, but it's the political consultancy industry in Washington which is... filthy, totally corrupt.\" </p> <p>Hillsman believes that the opinion polls which drive so much of political debate and strategy are skewed to benefit the two main parties and that political advertising is so poor partly because ad agencies make their money on a proportion - 15% - of what is spent on buying airtime; thus the more they spend on production values, the less they have to buy commercial spots and consequently the smaller percentage they get. Hence, according to Hillsman, the low and cliched standard of much political advertising: \"There's an inherent conflict of interest.\" </p> <p>The \"nadir\" of political campaigning - Hillsman, like a good adman, notes the pun - has led to Nader running. His campaign is already making waves, causing the Democrats to warn that if Nader does well - he is around 7% in the polls - he could let George W Bush into the White House by drawing votes away from Al Gore. Hillsman is not concerned about that scenario and has even offered the Democrats, for whom he has done much work in the past decade, his services to mastermind a negative campaign against Bush. It sounds as though he has already written his first draft. </p> <p>\"George Bush is a walking corporation who has never done anything in his entire life except to have people take care of him,\" he says. Bush has already spent around $60m. This week his campaign ads have shown him in an open-necked shirt mingling with students while he intones: \"It's easy just to spend more. Let's start by expecting more.\" </p> <p>The standard of political advertising is abysmally low, according to Hillsman. \"The people who practise political media consultancy really don't understand modern communications. They are using advertising theories that were de rigueur in the 50s and the 70s.\" The former style was the repeated mention of a unique selling proposition, \"the notion that if you kept hammering away [the message] would eventually bludgeon its way into people's consciousness.\" </p> <p>In the 70s, the style was to keep mentioning the brand name and focus on the \"pack shot\". Both methods, Hillsman says, are now off-putting to a visually sophisticated audience. \"I think it's insane. The prevailing philosophy seems to be that you can annoy someone into voting for you.\" </p> <p>What many, including Hillsman, believe were the most effective presidential commercials were those run for Ronald Reagan in 1984, shot on film using a big budget and creating a warm, feel-good, homy atmosphere under the slogan of \"It's morning again in America.\" Hillsman says of the mood in the ads: \"There would be a small-town parade; people would be running the flags up the flagpole. It was total propaganda but it was so well done that it was almost impossible to resist. Meanwhile, [Walter] Mondale was doing the same old crap and not breaking through at all.\" </p> <p>George Bush senior used negative ads to effect against Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988, most notably with a commercial showing prisoners moving through a revolving door to create the impression of someone weak on crime, always seen as a vote-winning issue. Four years later, Bush was the victim when the Clinton campaign in 1992 mocked Bush's earlier claim of \"read my lips - no new taxes.\" But there are risks in negative campaigning nowadays. \"There is more backlash against it now; it's being put more and more under scrutiny by the press,\" says Hillsman. The real negative damage, he says, is now \"below the radar\", a tactic which Bush last used against this year's defeated Republican candidate John McCain. </p> <p>Al Gore's best bet, Hillsman believes, is to have a one-to-one debate with Bush. \"The Gore people are struggling. At this point they are really hoping that the [three planned live television] debates will be the turning point in which Gore [could exploit] Bush's lack of fire power upstairs. I would not do much different for Bush. I think they're doing a very adroit job of trying to move Bush towards the centre, a typical Republican strategy, trying to soften his image - compassionate conservatism - and totally ignoring the actual truth of the situation.\" </p> <p>He dismisses the Gore camp's claims that a Nader vote will be wasted, because the Nader voters, in Hillsman's estimation, come largely from the 50% of the electorate who do not bother to vote for a president: \"They don't accept the idea of voting for the lesser evil. They don't want to vote for evil at all.\" </p> <p>On other forms of reaching the electorate, he says: \"It's an open book on how effective the internet sites are going to be in politics.\" Those using the internet to gather information on politics, he says, are almost all independents. \"They don't believe the information they get from the two main political parties and they don't really believe the established media any more.\" He believes that this will aid the Nader camp. \"Because people have such a low opinion of politicians, you start below zero on the truth meter if you're a politician. In Ralph's case, you can't get him to not tell the truth. That's a powerful weapon. He is arguably the most trusted man in America.\" </p> <p>In the current Adweek, the industry paper, Debra Goldman asks: \"Can democracy withstand a campaign so excruciatingly long that voters die of boredom long before election day?... The budget of a third-world country has been poured into a campaign that no one is watching.\" </p> <p>Hillsman may have only around $5m in his kitty, but he is able to talk persuasively of how Nader could start to reach 10% in the polls, then 15%, then 18%, then... well, he does believe that the only safe thing is to take a chance. Come November, he could be the man exposing Bush's \"lack of fire power\" or the man who frustrates Gore. Either way, the scenery on the long and expensive journey to the White House should have become a little more entertaining - and the politics a little sharper.</p>",
  "<p>The BBC marked the death of Sir Alec Guinness by rescreening a Parkinson interview from the late 70s. His conversation was urbane, educated, literate. In general, though, actors are the most difficult interviewees to be found among public professionals. This is because their talent is for disguise and borrowed lines. Expecting an actor to impress as himself imposes the same limitations as insisting the Home Secretary discuss prisons with John Humphrys only in the persona of the Prince of Denmark. </p> <p>For this reason, hopes were low for Channel 4's Starstruck, a four-part series about acting. But while the fault of many interviews with actors is to exaggerate the perils and risks of what they do - that notorious thespian tendency to compare a supporting role in Chekhov to swimming through shark-infested rivers - this series from Emmas Hewitt and Cahusac concentrates on genuine dangers. </p> <p>For example, this week's opening night show focuses on the sexual (and usually sexist) dynamics of casting. Renee Simone, a Hollywood hopeful, is seen living on a regime of sweat-out and water-in as she struggles to lose the final 10 pounds (she's already shed 51) which may bring her closer to the industry's anorexic definition of sexiness. For actresses, it's a paradox of casting directors that the more you vanish the more they see you. </p> <p>Renee's acting career fails to progress, but the agents and advisers around her seem certain to be cast in the next satire from Woody Allen or David Mamet on the movie business. One of the joys of the programme is that Renee's entourage are all fluent in the cinematic gangsterese which is now the lingua franca of Beverly Hills. </p> <p>One of the agents advising Renee specialises in muscular but impenetrable metaphor. \"What she projects is beach-blanket bingo,\" she complains of the still insufficiently skeletal Renee, \"and that's so OUT right now!\" As bad news continues to come in from the gym and the scales, the advisors decide temporarily to abandon the strategy of melting Renee towards leading-lady weight. \"We're going to put glasses on her and have her be a nerd. There's lots of freaks and geeks out there... Until we're ready to unveil the moth, we'll show her as a butterfly or she'll be a swan.\" </p> <p>The beach-blanket bingo butterfly is last seen going nowhere on a gym nasium treadmill and seeking a new agent. Her story is funny - especially the dialogue - but disturbing in its implications. As you watch, you want her to raise two fingers to the Hollywood system but you fear that any digits lifted would soon go down her throat. </p> <p>Renee's English co-star in the documentary is Ella Kenion, an actress from among the middle-higher dress-sizes who watches the big parts going to small women. Filmed auditioning for a Scandinavian emulsion commercial, she is warned by her agent that, in order to win the role of the screen wife watching paint dry, she mustn't come across as \"an eager beaver or a nag\". She nervously checks with the documentary's director that the cardigan she's chosen doesn't make her look \"enormous\". </p> <p>The film's thesis that cinema and television are cast as wet dreams for men isn't new, and could be as thin as the actress who wins out over Ella in selling paint to Swedes. But the power is in the evidential detail of the anecdotes - the casting session where the room was dominated by a giant mattress on which the director conducted horizontal interviews; the ageing famous actor who, as a matter of routine, pressed his erection against the backs of the junior actresses as they waited in the wings; the young American actresses now apparently having plastic surgery as an investment towards possible celebrity. </p> <p>In a therapeutic reversal of professional convention, unknowns take the lead roles in the documentary while stars have soundbite bit-parts. Where the experience of Renee and Ella demonstrates the pseudo-sex of casting, established performers describe the etiquette of faking sex on screen. </p> <p>Withnail And I writer Bruce Robinson recalls his experience as a young actor on a Zefferelli film when - failing to simulate excitement to the degree the maestro wanted - a box of strap-on phalluses of different sizes was proffered by the props man. Fay Ripley from ITV's Cold Feet reveals a kind of Geneva Convention within the profession relating to the rehearsal and performance of sex scenes. Verbal permission should be sought before the tongue is employed and teeth should be cleaned if filming after lunch. </p> <p>Ripley also admits that she was disappointed when the actor playing her husband failed to become erect during a mock marital grappling. This anecdote is reckless candour but serves the main theme of the piece, which is that actresses are encouraged to judge themselves by their ability to arouse men. There are sub-plots which might have been explored - the tendency of actors playing lovers to mate for real, the eating and dieting agonies of the prettier male stars - but, unlike most of the acting profession, the programme consistently works. </p> <p>Starstruck, Wednesday, 9pm, Channel 4.</p> <p><strong>New for old</strong></p> <p>Later this year, writer Robert Hughes updates one of his hit TV series in The Fatal Shore Revisited. And another of his titles - The Shock Of The New - is punningly extended by Piers Gough in his history of British architecture, The Shock Of The Old (Sunday, 8pm, C4). </p> <p>The expert overview has become a controversial form of TV because of industry prejudices about economics (long documentary series consume money), democracy (should so much time be given to a single voice?) and populism (can viewers still appreciate dense ideas?). </p> <p>The biggest difficulty of such a series is deciding the level at which the information should be pitched. In book publishing, there is a clear division between works for experts and populist primers. A TV history must anticipate being watched by both. Any line in the script may be received simultaneously on two different sofas as patronisingly simplistic and excludingly difficult. Andrew Graham Dixon's Renaissance was criticised for being too heavy, Peter Jay's Road To Riches for straining too hard towards lightness. </p> <p>Gough, whose thesis is that British architecture has been consistently innovative, relies on the popularising device of the contemporary parallel, visual and verbal. The Triumphal Arch which admitted the Romans on to Watling Street is aped in the Trafford Shopping Centre. The Roman Baths were \"not so very different from a health club\". </p> <p>The opening episode is best when overturning expectations. Roman mosaic floors are cited as examples of shoddy workmanship. The huts in which Britons lived before the Romans are shown to have been surprisingly sophisticated homes. </p> <p>Gough's encomium to old technology also benefits from the new: graphics - including the 3D computer fly-through - allow an unusually vivid impression of how buildings would have looked. The first episode of The Shock Of The Old doesn't quite earn the cheeky identification with Hughes' art series, but solid foundations are there.</p>",
  "Senior politicians in rival parties yesterday closed ranks behind William Hague's call for tougher penalties for paedophiles after weeks of recurring street violence over the \"naming and shaming\" of sexual offenders against children. <p>Although neither John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, nor Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, endorsed the Conservative leader's detailed proposals, they were notably conciliatory in welcoming Mr Hague's suggestions - ideas that should be \"considered\" in the current review of the law, he suggested. </p> <p>After outbreaks of mob violence on some estates where ex-offenders have been housed, notably in Portsmouth, Westminster politicians have been nervously keen to lower the temperature and discourage people from taking the law into their own hands. \"However strong and understandable the emotions of those parents on the Portsmouth housing estate are, the resort to the rule of the mob is absolutely wrong,\" declared Mr Hague. </p> <p>After months when he has sought to make the political weather with a series of populist pronouncements on law- and-order issues, that appeared to draw a distinction between public debate and behaviour that threatens lives and the rule of law. </p> <p>In an article for the Sunday Times, sister paper of the News of the World, whose campaign triggered the recent disturbances, the Tory leader suggested mandatory life sentences for the worst first-time sex offenders, so they would be on licence after release. </p> <p>In a package designed to ally public concern after the murder of Sarah Payne, whose memorial service was held in Guildford Cathedral on Saturday, Mr Hague also proposed: </p> <p>\u0095Obliging those convicted of paedophile offences abroad to register their return to Britain; </p> <p>\u0095Extending supervision beyond the current 10-year maximum and possibly introducing the tagging of offenders for an indefinite period; </p> <p>\u0095Preventing released offenders living near or making contact with victims, \"one of the greatest fears of victims\". </p> <p>In reality there was little in the Hague article that is not under active consideration, officials later signalled. But the conciliatory gesture itself was significant after the partisan exchanges this summer over asylum policy and such issues as the jailing of Tony Martin for murdering a burglar. </p> <p>Speaking on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Prescott, in charge of the government while Tony Blair is on holiday, welcomed Mr Hague's contribution and called for a consensus between the political parties in the review. </p> <p>He denied that he had ever blamed the Tories' rhetoric for creating the vigilantes. But he was quick to add: \"We all deplore what has happened, but at the end of the day, there is a kind of atmosphere which leads to insecurity and fear, which I think perhaps the Tories have tended to influence by some of their statements.\" </p> <p>On the same programme, Michael Ancram, the Tory chairman, said Mr Hague was trying to turn debate away from the \"understandably emotional\" reaction to Sarah Payne's murder by strengthening the law \"not by resorting to what we've sadly seen over these last few weeks which has been, effectively, the rule of the mob\". </p> <p>Mr Hughes, a criminal barrister like Mr Ancram, was less polite. He welcomed \"closing the loophole\" on overseas offenders and better supervision. But in language echoed by the National Association for the Care and Settlement of Offenders, he insisted: \"Mr Hague's ideas for mandatory life sentences are misleading and wrong, just as campaigns for naming and shaming are simplistic and wrong.\" </p> <p>The News of the World is facing the threat of legal action by people who were wrongly identified by members of the public as paedophiles during the paper's campaign.</p>",
  "<p>World fish stocks are seriously depleted. More and more vessels are chasing fewer and fewer fish, and prices are soaring. Attempts to control overfishing and save the industry from collapse have failed for 30 years. Over the next three days Guardian reporters assess the crisis and ask what can be done </p> <p> Hundreds of thousands of people once dependent on the fishing industry are looking for work and many more are struggling to replace once plentiful food supplies. In Britain alone, sea fishing now employs fewer than 18,000 people. Fifty years ago it was nearly 48,000. </p> <p>Despite bigger boats with better technology, and fleets that are able to range over any stretch of the oceans that cover two-thirds of the planet, world fish catches are going down. Big species such as tuna and cod are disappearing, fished to virtual extinction in many places. </p> <p>Two years ago the UN estimated that nearly half the world's fish stocks were fully exploited and if stocks were to have a chance of recovery one in three of the world's fishing boats would have to stop fishing. Nearly 70% of the world's stocks are in need of urgent management, the UN food and agriculture organisation said. </p> <p>In June all nine of the North Sea commercial fish stocks were described by European scientists as \"outside safe biological limits\" and 67% of all stocks in the north-east Atlantic were severely depleted or in danger of becoming so. And with bigger fish in serious decline smaller species, mackerel, sardines and anchovies, are now the main targets. </p> <p>Much of this fishing effort on smaller species does not go to the shops but to make food for fish farms. With stocks of larger wild fish species decreasing, fish farming is a worldwide boom industry. This year fish farming will provide one quarter of the fish sold for human consumption. </p> <p>But in Europe, in the supermarkets, consumers will hardly notice. Prices are going up and fish is already far more expensive than meat. The varieties have changed too, but there is no obvious shortage of supplies. </p> <p>Europe's stocks of fish are badly depleted because of 20 years of disastrous EU fishing policy. Annual ritual rejections of scientific advice about reducing catches to safeguard stocks, coupled with the ducking of difficult decisions on cutting fleet sizes, have led to mismanagement on a scandalous scale. </p> <p>Elliot Morley, British fisheries minister, admits that politicians have in the past failed to prevent the depletion of stocks, but denies the EU's claim that the UK has been one of the worst offenders. </p> <p>The European commission revealed this summer that the UK fleet has been cut by only 1% in the last three years instead of the 11% the government promised in 1997. Mr Morley says \u00a350m has been spent and the fleet is down. \"Despite what they say we are cutting fishing effort,\" he said. </p> <p>Controlling net sizes, the number of days boats can go to sea and effective satellite monitoring to combat cheating could all play a part in managing stocks, Mr Morley added. </p> <p>But Franz Fischler, the EU fisheries commissioner, is angry that carefully negotiated reductions among 13 fishing nations have failed to make any impact on fishing effort in Europe. He said: \"If anything the increase in technology in that time has made it easier and easier to pinpoint and catch the few fish that remain.\" </p> <p>Cod stocks in the North Sea are down to one tenth of the level of 30 years ago and in danger of extinction. The cod quota this year is 34,301 tonnes. Catches to July 13 were 13,305 tonnes, so low because fishermen just cannot find the fish. </p> <p>But the EU has disguised its chronic inability to manage once abundant fish stocks by using its financial clout to ensure that in Europe there is always enough fish to meet consumer demand. Its fleets now deplete the fisheries of Africa and South America. They deprive local people of food and work, and as they destroy once healthy stocks round the globe, they compete with other rich nations for ever-dwindling supplies. </p> <p>The fishing boats that are stripping the world's seas are not small local vessels seen in picturesque Cornish harbours, but giant floating freezer factories equipped with the most sophisticated radar locaters and satellite technology. Fish have no chance of escape. Entire shoals are surrounded by nets and sucked in for processing and freezing, leaving nothing left in the sea to breed and replenish the stocks. </p> <p>Around \u00a370m a year is paid to developing countries to allow 1,300 European boats to fish in their waters. A similar amount is paid to ship owners in subsidies to build new superboats. The excuse is that these subsidies to shipyards and boat owners finance 20,000 direct fishermen's jobs and another 50,000 in shipbuilding and processing plants in Europe. Mr Morley says this has to end but so far Britain has been outvoted. </p> <p>It is not just a European problem. Around the world from Japan to north America ever bigger trawlers fish and freeze 24 hours a day to take advantage of faraway fishing grounds. They then dock to sell their catch at the nearest port for export to distant cities. Exotic species are being introduced to home markets to satisfy a demand that can no longer be met from fished-out local seas. </p> <p>More than half the fish consumed in Europe is now imported because of depleted home water stocks. The EU has \"bought\" a share of the stocks of 14 African countries and is looking for more. The EU can and does outbid the Russians and other rival fishing fleets for a share of the less developed fisheries. </p> <p>In theory this should be good news for both the European consumer and the long- term health of the fish stocks because the EU claims it believes in sustainable fisheries. But the community's record is appalling, according to its detractors. </p> <p>While the EU argues that \"export\" of the surplus fishing capacity from the North Atlantic by buying fishing rights in developing countries is an extension of a traditional distant water fishing effort of countries such as the UK, Spain and Portugal, there is increasing anger at misuse of the system both in Brussels and in countries that are the \"victims\" of the fleets. </p> <p>Morocco has thrown out the EU from its waters after years of allowing exploitation by Spanish boats. The EU has paid the Spanish compensation and told them to tie up their boats while they try to buy more rights elsewhere. Chile responded by closing its harbours to EU vessels. </p> <p>Euan Dunn, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds' fisheries officer, said: \"We are exporting our own mismanagement of Europe's fish stocks to the developing world. We are moving from stock to stock, systematically destroying it and moving on to the next. The EU fishing policy stinks and there will soon be very few fish to catch.\" </p> <p>Evidence is mounting that once a fish stock is overfished it may never recover. The best example is cod in the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, once the most prolific fishery in the world. </p> <p>Despite repeated warnings from scientists, the politicians allowed fishing to continue until the cod stocks collapsed. The fishery was closed in 1992 to allow stocks to recover, throwing more than 40,000 people out of work. </p> <p>At worst the fishery was expected to be closed for three years. Eight years later the cod have not come back. </p> <p>There are a number of theories why this should be, from the wrong water temperature for breeding, to seals eating them, but the most likely is that the cod's niche in the sea has been taken by other species. Predators such as dogfish eat their eggs and they may never recover. </p> <p>Despite the fact that cod stocks continued to decline, the politicians in Canada refused to take scientific advice to keep the fishery closed, and suppressed a report it had commissioned that recommended the cod be declared an endangered species. </p> <p>And there is increasing evidence that once cod are taken out of the eco-system the balance changes. </p> <p>In both Newfoundland and on the shores of the UK, where cod stocks are in dire straits, shrimps and longuistinas, the food that cod usually eat, have ballooned in numbers. In Scotland, for example, this group of prawn type species - nephrops as they are known - are now as important a catch as haddock, and sold as scampi are far more numerous and valuable than cod. </p> <p>This targeting of smaller and smaller but suddenly more numerous creatures, once the prey of larger fish which have nearly all been caught, is called \"fishing down the food chain\". Initially it leads to higher catches but then that source too is exhausted. </p> <p>The Norwegians have recently suggested harvesting the plankton, the smallest living organisms of the ocean which include the larvae of many fish and shellfish, in order to provide food for fish farms. </p> <p>Mr Dunn said: \"This is taking fishing down the food chain to its ultimate conclusion and wiping out all stocks at source, literally emptying the oceans of life and preventing any recovery. It cannot be allowed to happen.\"</p>",
  "The British owner of the Thai guesthouse where the backpacker Kirsty Jones was murdered denied from his prison cell last night having anything to do with her death, and said the results of DNA tests would prove his innocence. <p>Andy Gill, 32, who was questioned for several hours by detectives on Saturday, claimed that at the time Kirsty was strangled he had been drinking in a bar. He had arrived back at the Aree guesthouse at 1.45am on Thursday, he said - 45 minutes after other residents had been woken by her screams.</p> <p>Speaking on a mobile phone from inside prison in the hill resort of Chiang Mai, he said yesterday: \"I had nothing to do with Kirsty's death. We will find out on Tuesday when the results of DNA tests come through. I had no idea about her murder until the next day.</p> <p>\"When I met Surin [the guest house manager] he asked me: 'Did you hear anything last night?' I said: 'I wasn't here.' He said: 'We heard some sort of yelling and came downstairs.' \"</p> <p>Mr Gill said he decided to disappear after Kirsty's body was found in a downstairs bedroom because he does not have a visa. \"I didn't want to hang around for the police to find me because of the visa issue,\" he said. He did not know Kirsty personally, he added. \"I met her before she went trekking. I was there when she checked in. We were very busy that day.\"</p> <p>Thai police arrested Mr Gill, who bought the guesthouse illegally last November, on Saturday afternoon while he was drinking in a bar nearby. He was taken into custody and appeared in court yesterday charged with overstaying his visa by two years. He was also interrogated over Kirsty's murder. \"I can confirm he is one of the suspects,\" police colonel Suvit Khunprasert said.</p> <p>Recounting his movements on the night of the murder, Mr Gill said he visited an internet cafe before moving on to the Viking bar in downtown Chiang Mai. He met two friends, Andy and Mick. He had some food, and arrived back at the Aree with another Thai friend, Fai, who knew his Thai girlfriend. \"She is my alibi,\" he said.</p> <p>He then went to the room next door to Kirsty's to remove a lamp he had lent to another guest, he claimed. \"I didn't notice whether the door was locked,\" he added.</p> <p>Staff at the Viking last night confirmed that Mr Gill, who is from London, had visited on Thursday night with two English friends. They said he left at \"around 1-1.30 am\".</p> <p>\"He was alone when he left,\" the Thai owner added. After his arrest on Saturday and that while in custody Mr Gill said that he \"volunteered\" to give a DNA sample in a local hospital.</p> <p>Officials from the British embassy in Bangkok visited him yesterday in his cramped prison cell with a wooden floor that he shares with 14 other inmates, most of whom are charged with drug offences.</p> <p>They include Stuart Crichton, an Australian backpacker who was staying at the Aree last week. He was arrested after Kirsty's murder when police allegedly found heroin and cannabis in his room.</p> <p>Mr Gill yesterday said he had spent much of his life abroad and had no family at home apart from an uncle. He had visited Thailand \"on and off\" for 12 years. He bought the guesthouse - in contravention of Thai law, which prevents foreigners from owning property - after selling a house he owned in Andorra that he had been renting out. \"I had been living off the rent money here,\" he said.</p> <p>Police investigating Kirsty's murder and rape are pinning their hopes that DNA samples taken from \"three or four\" foreign backpackers will lead them to her killer. The results are expected tomorrow or on Wednesday. They have so far interviewed at least five suspects: two Britons, two Australians, and one Thai.</p> <p>Mr Gill's ground floor room at the guesthouse, No 10, looks directly on to the back window of room four, where Kirsty was staying. The two rooms are six feet apart, separated by a narrow corridor. The inside of his door is decorated with pictures of Thai girls wearing bikinis. Yesterday a half-read Robert Ludlum novel and a pile of clothes had been left casually on his bed.</p>",
  "Sarah Payne's murder will have triggered alarm bells in homes up and down the country. Once again we are reminded of the need to keep our children close, constantly in view, for the loss of a child is every parent's ultimate nightmare. Few of us can imagine the pain of loss with which Sarah's parents and brothers and sister must be living. Like countless other parents I have felt the need to remind my children of age-old maxims - don't talk to strangers, never accept sweets from strangers, and never, ever go anywhere with anyone unexpectedly. Allowing my 11-year-old out to walk the dog alone for half an hour suddenly takes on a darker, more threatening hue and I wonder whether it's wise to be letting her out at all. <p>When child death was a common cultural experience, devastating but seemingly determined by God, parents had little choice but to accept that a child's welfare was out of their control. Now we know better. We know more about the nature of infection, rely more on medical advances and expect our children to survive us. We do everything humanly possible to keep our precious children safe, with stair gates, car seats, socket covers and curly flexes for the kettle. </p> <p>Conscientious mothers regularly detoxify kitchen surfaces, even toys, in order to cut down risk of infection. We never let them out of our sight, drive them to schools where they are locked in for their own welfare and we never stop telling them to \"be careful\". </p> <p>It is largely because of our success at keeping them alive that all those other more hidden and uncontrollable hazards, or chance happenings of life seem disproportionately threatening in the public imagination. Paedophilia, child murder, meningitis, even the carcinogenic properties of sunshine preoccupy us because they are beyond our control. But are we actually doing more harm than good through this obsessive, modern need to keep them so close and so safe when the real world they have to negotiate is riddled with risk, danger and, of course, the fickle finger of fate? </p> <p>Detoxification, lunchboxes made from antibacterial plastic and banning pets may limit infection but exposure to some dirt is essential to build up immunity. Structured play and learning may be good for them educationally but there is also evidence that too much can limit their imagination. Children who are left alone at times learn self-sufficiency, the ability to create something out of nothing. Watching over them constantly is impossible but countless parents try in order to protect them from hurting themselves, in spite of the fact that minor accidents teach small children far more than words. </p> <p>The toddler who has never been allowed to fall over cannot find the balance required in order to be able to stand properly. The child who has never touched the side of a kettle cannot really understand the meaning of \"it's hot\". The child who is driven everywhere never learns how to cross a road with an adult before he or she attempts it alone. They also never learn how to buy a bus ticket or how to rub shoulders with silent, anonymous strangers. </p> <p>Our relentless concern for our children means that we can easily fall into the trap of overprotecting them and that can have damaging consequences for their development. Children who have everything done for them never learn how to do things for themselves. \"We don't want children to fight their own battles, even when they are very little,\" says child psychotherapist Asha Phillips. \"When there's a problem with friends or teachers we step in too quickly to try and sort things out for them and that means that children do not know how to solve social difficulties for themselves.\" </p> <p>The same is true of risk. Without an understanding of risk, there is no achievement, there is no sense of the need to strive for things and no sense of how to cope when they fail. </p> <p>Risk is crucial to life - we risk failure or humiliation with every audition or job interview, we risk physical accident with sports and competitions but that does not mean that we shouldn't try. Children have to be allowed to fail, to face risk, even danger at times, in order to recognise the emotions triggered by those events, find ways of coping with them and develop their own judgment. </p> <p>When a small child loses a parent in the playground, even for a few moments, he or she may feel fear and anxiety and have to stop and consider what to do. If, when he finds that parent, words are used to give the experience meaning: \"Were you worried when you couldn't find me in the playground?\" Such an open-ended question allows the child to understand that these feelings are normal and solutions can be discussed for the next time a child feels similar anxiety; for example: \"Don't panic, stay where you are and I'll find you, or ask another mummy close by to help you find me.\" But if that parent is so over-anxious about the child's welfare, if she assumes that he must have been frightened because she was, the child learns only that the big bad world is a place to fear, a place where he cannot survive without her and strategies for survival are likely to be thin on the ground. </p> <p>Loving parents like to eliminate as many negatives as possible from a child's life. We soothe upsets, we like to see them happy. But children who have never been allowed to feel negative emotions lack the resources to deal with bigger difficulties as they get older. They are denied opportunities to develop internal controls or to trust their own instincts. </p> <p>Jeannie Milligan is a psychotherapist who works in the adolescent department at the Tavistock Centre, London. \"I see kids who have a distorted view of life as something traumatic has happened to them and that really interferes with their capacity to develop judgment on a solid basis. \"They lose their reference points if they have had too many odd experiences without parents talking to them adequately about what is going on. But, if you flip the coin, there is a similar paralysis for children who have always had their parents step in to protect them. It's about building up a repertoire of experience as you grow up, coming to recognise what fits with your best view of your world and what is at odds with it, and each child does that uniquely.\" </p> <p>When children haven't developed a solid basis of judgment in the face of risk, adolescence may be harder to deal with. In fact, we may be unwittingly sowing the seeds for greater health-risk behaviour in teenagers due to our reluctance to let them experiment as younger children. They have to be allowed to develop their own internal controls and that comes from practice and experimentation. Parents cannot stop teenagers from taking drugs or drinking too much; they have to learn their limits for themselves. \"Taking risks is part of growing up and doing things that you haven't done before and so may be creative,\" says Milligan. \"But you also need to develop a sense of when pushing those boundaries stops being creative and becomes disturbing or self destructive. You also need to develop the confidence to know that you don't have to go along with things and that is true for a whole range of things, from whether to go out with a boy, where you need to trust your own instinct but you also have to have a go, to resisting heroin.\" </p> <p>If you are used to having everything done for you, how then do you manage the inexorable drive for autonomy that is integral to adolescence and cope with growing up? \"How do you leave home, cross the road alone or cope with the painful fact that a friend has let you down or betrayed you?\"says Milligan. </p> <p>And if children are so emotionally embroiled and dependent on parents for survival, the normal rejections and rebellions of adolescence become more complex, the emotional loss of childhood harder to bear. \"It is harder for over-protected teenagers,\" says Asha Phillips, \"partly because you feel that your parents know and control everything and partly because you need them more. You've been protected all the time and therefore don't want to lose that protection through conflict or rebellion.\" </p> <p>Such adolescents are also likely to be more secretive about their activities and find it harder to confide in, or seek guidance from, parents in case their honesty provokes upset, misunderstanding or rejection. </p> <p>We give our children so many mixed messages. We tell them not to talk to strangers yet they see us talking to strangers every day. Media obsessions with sex, drugs, violence and television soaps create the impression that daily life is awash with trauma and extreme danger and children can pick up a distorted view of life, unless given adequate explanations by parents. Yet we shy away from these subjects, reluctant to discuss them in case they should shock, frighten or offend. Without adequate discussion, children have no way of knowing that the murder of Sarah Payne was an extremely rare case. Last year, five children between the ages of five and 14 were murdered in England and Wales. \"We're constantly conveying to them that other people are untrustworthy and that only the family is safe, which often isn't true,\" says Phillips. Children are statistically at much greater risk of being abused or hurt when they are at home alone with a stepfather or Uncle Fred than by strangers. </p> <p>Our need to preserve childhood as something precious and innocent means that we have a tendency to romanticise it. But we have a duty as parents to bring up children so that they can survive and succeed within the world as it is, rather than in the idealistic fantasies of our imaginings. </p> <p>Separating our own emotions from their needs is crucial. Never letting them out alone may appease our own fears and anxieties but such a strategy fails children and denies them a fundamental human right to explore and discover for themselves. From the moment the umbilical cord is cut, parents embark on a slow process of letting the child go. There is weaning, learning to walk away, spending that first night away from home and going to school. Allowing a child out alone feels like a monumental step to take when there is so much danger out there to threaten their welfare. But, gradually, they have to go. </p> <p>When my 11-year-old daughter is 10 minutes late back from walking the dog, I imagine her being run over by a car and then abducted by paedophiles. I am at the window waiting for her to return. Sometimes I even walk out to the corner to see if I can spot them walking home. When she knocks, I smile as I open the door and have to stifle the words on the tip of my tongue (Where have you been? I've been worried sick ...) because this is my panic, my anxiety, my concern and not hers. She has had a great time, as she should have. </p> <p>Kate Figes is the author of Life After Birth, published by Penguin, priced \u00a37.99.</p>",
  "William Hague's call yesterday for the worst first-time sexual offenders against children to be given mandatory life sentences is probably at least partly in response to a public perception that the criminal justice system deals too leniently with sex offenders. But matters to do with sexual behaviour, whether legal or illegal, are rarely straightforward, and this is especially apparent when sex offending against children is involved. A failure to address these complexities, however, does not make society any safer for our children. <p>The role of the courts is not only to punish, but also to provide protection from offenders. This latter task has been made more clear in relation to sex offenders through recent legislation allowing for \"longer than normal sentences\", extended supervision in the community following prison release, and the creation of a sex offender register. </p> <p>However, punishment and protection are not the same thing, and they at times can pull in opposite directions. While there is something undoubtedly satisfying about the clunk of a jail door closing behind the convicted child molester, society is kept safe from him only as long as he remains behind bars. In the longer term, it is what happens to him while he is in custody, and then how he is managed following release, that determines whether or not he remains a danger. </p> <p>It has long been a complaint of those who must deal with sex offenders that short-prison sentences can do more harm than good, leaving little time for appropriate treatment (and, in respect of those sceptics who would say \"so what, treatment doesn't work anyway\", it is worth pointing out that there is now a reasonable amount of evidence to show that they are wrong). </p> <p>Of course, one could solve this problem by simply giving every convicted sex offender a life sentence. But why single out one type of crime in this way? Why not sentence all violent offenders to life imprisonment? As awful as any sex or violent offence is, we recognise that some are more serious than others, and there needs to be proportionality in how they are punished. In any case, even life sentence prisoners get out one day. In reality, one would be exchanging determinate sentences for tariffs, being lulled by the apparent greater ferocity of \"life (with a tariff of 12 years)\" compared with a 10-year fixed sentence. </p> <p>Of course, offenders serving life sentences are at least kept in prison until they are thought to be less dangerous, bringing us back again to the blurred line between punishment and protection. The problem is, not all sex offenders represent a high risk of reoffending. Overall, about one in five are convicted a second time, and even though some will reoffend without being caught, it is still the case that the majority do not offend again. Furthermore, probation orders, provided they include close monitoring and treatment input, also reduce risk, and it is very uncommon for sex offenders to reoffend while on such orders - prison cells are not always needed to stop an individual from attacking children. </p> <p>Surveys in a wide variety of countries have invariably found that there are many more victims of childhood sexual assaults than there are convicted offenders to account for them. Thus, while there are over 100,000 men living in England who have convictions for sex offences against children, there is almost certainly an even larger number of men who have offended against children but who have not been detected, and who are on no one's list. Those men who do come before the courts are just one element of a much greater problem. </p> <p>It is an illusion to believe that communities will be safe if we simply identify and remove a few individuals, either through naming and shaming them or through automatic prison sentences. Is it all right for children to accept rides from strangers, or to accompany someone home whom they don't know, so long as they are not on a sex offender register? Protecting children from sex offenders means being able to make an accurate assessment of the nature and degree of risk offenders pose so that appropriate treatment, monitoring, and containment can be made. </p> <p>But probably even more important is better education - of children, their parents, and those who work with them in a variety of settings - so that offences do not occur in the first place, or are discovered quickly. Retribution also has a role to play in public protection, albeit a limited one, although without question it does serve to make us feel better. </p> <p>\u0095 Don Grubin is professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Newcastle. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The Beehive on the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth is friendlier than it looks. Described by one local as \"rough as arseholes\" the landlord prefers to refer to it as a family pub. There are goats, rabbits and birds in the back for children to look at and at the bar a strange face attracts more conversation these days than hostile stares. <p>And what the conversation loses in logic it more than makes up for in moral certainty. </p> <p>Paedophiles, agree Dave and Mike (not their real names), \"need a slap\" because they have committed \"the mother of all crimes\". But nothing, they say, can condone the rioting on the estate that made the headlines last week. The trouble, they insist, with young people today is that they get away with too much. \"In my day if you got in trouble at school you'd get the cane,\" recalls Dave. \"At home you'd get the slipper and in the street then a policeman would give you a clip round the ear. But you're not allowed to hit kids nowadays and they just run riot.\" </p> <p>In short, there is so much violence because there is not enough violence. Between them, a few pints and a few hours, they come up with a wish list of things needed to put the country right that is long and broad as their tattooed arms. They flit between national service, longer prison sentences, greater parental control and order in Northern Ireland. They are no more contradictory or less cogent than barroom philosophers anywhere else in the country and their arguments are held together with the same strong, thin thread of political reasoning. It is called populism; and increasingly, in the presence of new technologies and the absence of meaningful, mainstream agendas, it is dominating the British political landscape. </p> <p>The latest example is the News of the World campaign to avenge the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne by \"naming and shaming\" paedophiles and establishing \"Sarah's Law\". But before then there was the drive to keep Section 28. And in between came Tony Martin, the Have-a-Go Harry who earned brief folkloric status when he murdered a teenage burglar, dump the pump and the standoffs at Drumcree in the north of Ireland. </p> <p>Not all have been successful, since, where populism is concerned, success depends not on the power of the argument or the possible benefits of any particular outcome but on the degree to which those involved manage to locate the right nerve at the right time and in the right way. That is the very art of the populist. To tap a nerve that pits the wrath of the many against the perceived vested interests of a few. Dump the pump failed miserably; Sarah's law has made a definite but ill-defined impact; Section 28 still stands in England. </p> <p>Whatever the outcome they share some common attributes. Each has at its root some visceral, atavistic nugget of \"common sense\" - \"a man has a right to protect his property\", \"life should mean life\" or \"homosexuality is not natural\" - through which any shaded argument, empirical evidence or moral alternative is first refracted to the point of distortion and then eliminated. And in order to have any hope of success each has had to rely on lowest common denominator politics that are necessarily crude and majoritarian. </p> <p>Populism, while not a coherent set of political beliefs is nonetheless a coherent political strategy for cohering disparate forces. It draws its legitimacy from the support in enjoys among the working class. But it rarely draws its leaders from them. The campaign against Section 28 in Scotland was bankrolled by millionaire Brian Souter; in England it was lead by the unelected Lords. If populism's proletarian footsoldiers behave themselves they are idealised as \"ordinary folk\"; if they misbehave, as they did in Paulsgrove, their former allies disown them as an \"uncouth mob\". </p> <p>Therein lies both the strength and the weakness of populism. It stands above party and beyond many, but by no means all, established social and economic constituencies in a bid to galvanise large numbers of people over one issue. Very occasionally its targets might be privileged and effete - high street banks, fox hunters or fat cats - but for the most part they comprise the weakest and the most vulnerable - asylum seekers, drug addicts, single mothers or gays and lesbians - who are less well equipped to defend themselves. </p> <p>These scapegoats are never picked at random or in relation to the threat they may pose at any one time - none of the mothers in Paulsgrove could recall the last time there was a sex offence against a child in the area. They are deliberately identified as the group which would attract the broadest swathe of opposition and the deepest levels of resentment at any one time. </p> <p>So while there is nothing intrinsically reactionary in populism, it rarely lends itself neatly to progressive causes either. Ken Livingstone and Jesse Jackson are two of the most talented populists on the left. But the list on the right, which would include Ian Paisley, Silvio Berlusconi, J\u00f6rg Haider and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is far longer and more powerful. </p> <p>Wherever they exist, the populist cause has been greatly facilitated by both the internet and special phone lines. It is from the web that the list of \"paedophiles\" in Paulsgrove emerged and through it that the ill-fated dump the pump attempted to organise. Which shows that with the right subject it has the unique ability to create, forge and mobilise political communities literally out of thin air. </p> <p>They have also taken to erecting parallel and impromptu pastiches of democracy to endorse their position. Brian Souter financed a \"referendum\" in Scotland; most news-based websites invite you to vote on an issue of the day; tabloids publish telephone referenda as a daily affair on anything from Hague's pints to the nation's paedophiles. </p> <p>At a time when attendance at the polls is plummeting we have become a dial and click democracy. The number of votes cast last week to evict either Caroline or Thomas from Big Brother is only fractionally below the number of votes cast in both Scotland and Wales in last year's European elections. By the end of this week it will almost certainly have overtaken those who voted for London mayor. </p> <p>The reaction of the political class to this new wave of populism has been uneven. The Liberals have stood consistently aloof. Labour, which is obsessed by focus groups, showed mettle on Sarah's Law but buckled over asylum seekers. Hague meanwhile has been a feather for every wind that blows. Slavish and opportunistic at every turn, he has rushed to grab every bigoted placard that comes his way, be it against asylum seekers, paedophiles or gays. </p> <p>But the best is yet to come. For within a few years we will see the populists dream - a referendum on the single currency. On one side, will stand the unions, Labour, the Liberals, big business and the free marketers in favour; on the other will be the hard left, small business, the tabloids, the hard right, xenophobes and Tories. Those with concerns about sovereignty and accountability will take second place to those with a knack for demagogy. And like the conversation in the Beehive, there is no saying where it will all end up. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gary.younge@theguardian.com\">gary.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The choice is between chive pancake spirals and tapenade crostini at the regular must-go-to Friday evening rooftop bash in central San Francisco thrown by the internet's news magazine, the Industry Standard. </p> <p>As the margaritas and chat of the latest start-ups flow, the free frisbees are handed out and the weekend beckons, it is hard to imagine that all is not well in the capital of the dot.com world. </p> <p>But resentment is stirring in Silicon Valley. Earlier this month a petition bearing 20,000 signatures was delivered to San Francisco's department of elections, heralding a new fight between the clashing cultures of one of the world's great cities. </p> <p>The signatures mean that later this year voters will decide whether to call a halt to the flood of e-commerce companies taking over the city and making its residents and artistic community homeless. </p> <p>On the other side of the city, in Portrero Hill, the unfinished canvases lean against the wall of Debra Walker's studio. Ms Walker, a well known local artist, has just been named in the annual awards of the Bay Guardian as a \"local hero\" for her campaign against the developers. As a founder of the Coalition for Jobs, Arts and Housing, she is one of the people behind the proposition that would limit office development, provide affordable housing and require landlords to let a percentage of space to artisans and non-profit organisations. </p> <p>\"The whole cultural world of San Francisco is being rocked,\" she said. \"What is happening right now could affect the whole future of the city. Theatre groups, artists, dance companies - every venue is at risk. Even the blue-chip art galleries are closing, and all that will be left here will be museums. Where we are now is the result of unmitigated development.\" </p> <p>Nowhere are the changes clearer than the district where she works. Originally an industrial area, it evolved into a home for print shops, laundries and studios. Ms Walker moved into her studio in 1984. But as Silicon Valley prices soared, the new companies sought cheaper space in San Francisco. E-commerce companies like Dotcomix, Red Ladder and Spinner, the free music company, have arrived and the nearby restaurant caters very specifically for the laptop-bearing newcomers, with smoked salmon filone for breakfast and meeting-places for the nascent companies. </p> <p>\"San Francisco will be like Singapore in five years,\" said David Adams, of Earthjustice, the non-profitmaking environmental law firm which has its offices in Montgomery Street, in the city's central area. \"There will be nice hotels and shops but all the atmosphere and the culture - both underground and accessible - will be elsewhere. It will be a city of commerce and banking. </p> <p>For the last decade, Earthjustice has been at the hub of the city, but the office building it leases a part of has now been sold for $98m and the market rate for office space in the area has gone up to $80 a square foot. This means that the charity's rent would rise from $360,000 to $1.6m million a year. It will therefore have to move. All the non-profit organisations and charities that have served San Francisco face the same threat. </p> <p>The release of figures last month by the California Association of Realtors showed that the median sale price of a condominium in the city had risen by 32% in the past year, to more than $500,000. </p> <p>\"There are people who are casualties of what has been going on,\" said Eric Savitz, an executive editor of Industry Standard, which charts e-commerce's ups and downs, as well as throwing the industry's best parties. </p> <p>He agrees that even the shakeout of companies has had little effect on property prices. \"It's taken the froth off the top of the market, but it's still pretty brutal.\" </p> <p>While the hi-tech companies move into the city, their workers have already colonised the most desirable residences in the valley. Mark Cowan, a manager in Silicon Valley, is typical - he bought his home in Santa Clara and Porsche Boxster with the money from stocks he cashed in. </p> <p>Many of the party-goers on the magazine's rooftop are sympathetic to the plight of those being driven out, such as teachers, fire-fighters and police officers, who now have to live many miles away. </p> <p>Inventive dot.com minds have come up with solutions for many of life's problems, but so far no one has quite worked out how to preserve the soul of the city at the heart of the boom.</p>",
  "<p>Welsh water and electricity group Hyder said yesterday it may suspend trading in its shares before the market reopens because of a debacle over a bidding contest for the company. </p> <p>The takeover panel on Friday failed to declare whether US joint venture Western Power Distribution or Japanese investment bank Nomura International was the highest bidder for Hyder because of a dispute over sealed bids. </p> <p>Britain's takeover regulator said its request for sealed bids yielded a response only from WPD, which bid 365p per Hyder share to trump a previous offer of 360p by Nomura. </p> <p>The highest offer should have won the day to take control of Wales's biggest company and its 9,000 staff. </p> <p>The battle between Nomura and US-controlled group WPD has now seen shareholders' stakes almost double in value over the last four and a half months. </p> <p>The panel allowed the bid to proceed even though it was not received within the specified time, but said it was calling a meeting to consider an appeal from Nomura. </p> <p>According to reports yesterday, that meeting is scheduled for Monday. </p> <p>A Hyder spokeswoman said that the company might suspend its shares unless the panel resolves the dispute before the stock market opens today. </p> <p>\"If they don't clarify the latest position we might have to ask for our shares to be suspended,\" she said. </p> <p>The contest has been troubled by claim and counter claim. On Friday there were hints that Nomura was unhappy as WPD did not make its raised offer public by 4.30pm - one of the rules of engagement laid down by the panel. </p> <p>There were also reports over the weekend that if the panel decided against Nomura, the Japanese bank would call on it to reopen the bidding contest with Japanese bank wanting both sides to put forward a \"best and final offer\". </p> <p>However there was speculation that the eventual loser will try to take the takeover panel to court. </p> <p>The loser is likely to seek a judicial review and may even sue the panel for damages. </p> <p>Institutional investors and merchant banks have also expressed dismay over the way the panel handled a procedure intended to produce a clear winner by Friday. </p> <p>WPD missed the deadline for submitting its offer after a disagreement with the panel over the bid's wording, the Independent said.

  "<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is poised to splash out up to $5bn (\u00a33.3bn) for 10 US regional television stations. </p> <p>In a deal that would give the company control of 32 stations in total, News Corp is expected to announce today the acquisition of Chris-Craft Industries and its BHC Communications and United Television subsidiaries. </p> <p>The expected purchase, for a price of between $3.5bn-$5bn, follows Friday night's surprise withdrawal from the takeover battle of Viacom, the media conglomerate owned by Sumner Redstone. </p> <p>Viacom, the world's second biggest media company after Time Warner, owns MTV, VH1, United Paramount and Paramount Studios and recently acquired the CBS network. It has been negotiating for several years to buy the stations from Chris-Craft. </p> <p>But in a short statement on Friday, which sent Chris-Craft shares crashing by 11%, Viacom said it \"has ended discussions with Chris-Craft and its subsidiaries regarding any acquisition\", leaving the field clear for News Corp. </p> <p>\"We liked the assets, but only at a price,\" Redstone said. \"The price wasn't right, and we decided to walk.\" </p> <p>After the market closed, Chris-Craft confirmed that it was in merger talks with another company. A deal would give News Corp access to previously untapped markets, including San Francisco, Baltimore and San Antonio, as well as allowing cost savings in markets where it already operates. </p> <p>Under new rules adopted last year, media companies can own two stations in a single market as long as there are a sufficient number of \"media voices\", which include all radio and television stations, large daily newspapers and cable systems. </p> <p>However, the federal communications commission still limits station groups to ownership of stations that cover no more than 35% of the nation's households. </p> <p>The Murdoch-owned New York Post reported that News Corp would have to sell several smaller stations to comply with the rule if he succeeds in buying the new stations. </p> <p>Chris-Craft, a former boat-building business, is owned by Herbert J Siegel, 72. The company owns 80% of BHC Communications, which in turn owns about 59% of United Television, which owns most of the stations. </p> <p>News Corp's shares closed on Friday down 87 cents at $49.75, reflecting fears that Mr Murdoch may be paying too much for the business.

  "Large scale football violence is becoming increasingly common with hooligans using the internet and mobile phones to arrange confrontations. <p>Figures released by the national criminal intelligence service, show that violence is again marring the domestic game, much of it taking place away from grounds or after matches have finished. </p> <p>The figures will embarrass government and football officals who have insisted that hooliganism usually takes place abroad when the national team is playing. </p> <p>While the overall number of arrests for hooliganism fell slightly to 3,137 last season, from 3,341 in the season 1998-1999, attacks were more violent and better organised, often involving weapons. </p> <p>Last season, there were 83 particularly violent incidents. In one of the most serious confrontations Stoke City and Cardiff City supporters battled throughout the day and into the night when the two teams met in a second division match. Other organised confrontations involved supporters of Wolverhampton Wanderers, Chelsea, Sunderland and Manchester City. </p> <p>There were a number of mass arrests with dozens of hooligans being rounded up to prevent trouble. In one incident, 168 Chelsea fans were arrested as they planned to attack Tottenham Hotspur fans. </p> <p>The number of arrests for racist chanting also increased with 34 people arrested compared to 25 during the 1998-99 season. Missile throwing also made an unwelcome return with 88 fans arrested for the offence last season compared to 42 the season before. </p> <p>Sunderland top the arrest league with 223 arrests last season followed by Chelsea, with 168 arrests. Macclesfield and Wycombe Wanderers had no arrests at their grounds while Manchester United had 88 arrests from a total crowd of 1.04m who attended their matches last season. </p> <p>There were 1,461 arrests in the Premiership, 831 in division one, 586 in division two and 259 in division three. </p> <p>With CCTV cameras installed at all league grounds and many matches heavily policed, the criminal intelligence service said most violence now takes place away from stadiums, particularly in town centres or as fans are travelling to or away from matches. </p> <p>The stereotype of the hooligan is changing, with many from middle class backgrounds working in the professions. The organisers are also involved in other criminal activity such as drug dealing and theft and are using technology to arrange confrontations. Bryan Drew, head of strategic and specialist intelligence at NCIS said: \"Football hooliganism is more sophisticated than it was. </p> <p>\"Invariably, the incidents are away from grounds and are therefore more difficult to police. The criminal hooligan element often know when a game is going to be 'police free' and far from being mindless they are often organised and adept at exploiting spontaneous situations.\" </p> <p>With the English football season starting last Saturday and the Premiership begining this weekend, police and football officals are hoping that the Football Spectators Act which comes into force next month will curb hooliganism. </p> <p>The law will prevent known hooligans from attending matches, either in Britain or abroad, and police will have the power to detain those they suspect of planning violence. </p> <p>The Home Office minister Lord Bassam said on Radio 4's The World this Weekend: \"Ten years ago we had something like 10,000 arrests (for football hooliganism) annually. Now that is down to around 3,000. We should not be complacent. There was a big problem at Euro 2000 and we have taken measures to stop it. </p> <p>\"The overall total number of arrests maybe down but the hooligans are still with us and there is clearly a hard core of thugs trying to have weekly pre-organised fights some way from the stadium.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Football Association said: \"They are not football supporters, they are criminals.\"</p> <p><b>Trouble spots for fans</b></p> <p><b> Cardiff City v Millwall, August 9, 1999, Nationwide League Div 2 and return fixture December 12</b> </p> <p>At Cardiff, a six-year-old girl received head injuries after being hit by a missile after clashes between 500 home fans and Millwall supporters. </p> <p>The return fixture saw trouble all day.

  "The Republican presidential candidate George W Bush said yesterday that he saw nothing improper in the weekend revelation that his running mate Dick Cheney has been given a \"retirement\" package worth $20m by the Texas oil multinational at which he has worked for less than five years. <p> The payment was agreed by the Dallas-based Halliburton Corporation on July 26, the same day that Mr Bush announced he had selected Mr Cheney. Had he resigned, clauses in his contract could have forced him to forfeit $10m or more in stock options and compensation. </p> <p>The news of Mr Cheney's latest windfall comes as details of the extent of the former US defence secretary's personal wealth from the oil business continued to emerge. It drew angry attacks from the Democrats. </p> <p>\"They'll turn the Oval Office into the Oil Office\", Al Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, said yesterday, adding that the question was whether Mr Cheney's ties would affect US energy and foreign policy under a Republican administration. </p> <p>Mr Bush told the Los Angeles Times in an interview that he saw no reason for Mr Cheney, 59, to stay out of energy-related policy deliberations because of his ties to the industry. </p> <p>But he added: \"What I want him to do is not be owning oil stocks so he benefits from decisions we make in the administration. He'll follow the same rules I'll follow and that is we'll put all of our assets into blind trusts.\" </p> <p>Like Mr Bush, Mr Cheney has amassed great personal wealth from the oil industry. His salary at Halliburton, which he joined in 1995, was $2m a year, but he also owns or has options on more than 1m Halliburton shares, worth $51m at current market prices. In May, Mr Cheney sold 100,000 shares, at a $5m profit. </p> <p>Mr Cheney has made clear that he has no intention of selling his other shares unless he is elected in November. \"Why not? I'm not on the government roll yet, I have no control over policy,\" he said last Friday. </p> <p>Mr Cheney is also entitled to $2.1m in \"deferred compensation\", which earns 10% interest while it goes unclaimed. </p> <p>\"The American public should be pleased that they have a vice-presidential nominee who has been successful,\" Mr Bush's spokeswoman Karen Hughes said yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>Steve Bennett shook a sheaf of yellow ignition wires out of a bag on to a pitted wooden lab bench. They cost about a pound each. In less than 18 months, he will literally bet his life that DIY warehouse components like this can do what only government billions have done before: send a man - namely, himself - shooting skywards in a multi-stage rocket. </p> <p>For Nasa's vast Cape Canaveral assembly halls, downsize to a crowded workshop at Salford University. For the steppes of Baikonour, substitute the sands of Morecambe Bay at low tide. And for Yuri Gagarin and Wernher von Braun rolled into one, accept, if you will, Mr Bennett. </p> <p>The would-be pioneer rocket pilot has a burning conviction that rocket science is ... well, not rocket science. In November next year he plans to prove it with his Nova rocket, which will fly to 10,000ft in 30 seconds with him squeezed into a capsule on top, before returning launch vehicle, capsule, and hopefully him to earth for reuse. All this for a mere \u00a3250,000. </p> <p>\"A lot of what we use we can actually pick up at B&amp;Q,\" said Mr Bennett, 37. \"The nuts and bolts don't have to be aerospace grade.\" </p> <p>Mr Bennett prides himself in the uncomplicated, tried and trusted bits and pieces which will make up Britain's first manned rocket, the design of which is seen here for the first time. </p> <p>Despite university backing, despite modest sponsorship from firms like Microsoft, despite 10 out of 12 of his unmanned rocket launches going as planned, the reputation of an unhinged amateur boffin clings to Mr Bennett - \"the Eddie the Eagle of rockets\", as he says resentfully. </p> <p>There is something of a Wallace and Gromit atmosphere in the workshop. Apart from a mock-up of a space capsule for a future, three-person rocket, and various smaller nose cones and sections of fuselage, the most visible apparatus is a fridge and a kettle. \"That's how I keep the team going. Free tea, free biscuits,\" he said. </p> <p>Then he fetches a small cardboard box from a store cupboard and brings out something about the size of a toilet roll. </p> <p>It is solid rocket fuel,as used in Nasa's space shuttle, imported from Nevada for \u00a3100 a slug. It's a reminder that, far out as he seems, Mr Bennett is the only enterpreneur in Europe to be making real rockets, like the two stage Starchaser-Discovery which roared into the north-western skies in July. </p> <p>It is thanks to Mr Bennett that British amateur rocketeers can legally import the fuel, classed as an explosive. And it is due to him that the government is being forced to change the law, which now allows anyone, in theory, to fire rockets into the skies over Britain any time. </p> <p>Mr Bennett now directs his efforts towards cadging sponsorship and free materials, persuading experts to give their time, and rallying a band of helpers. </p> <p>Nova is an intermediate step toward realising Mr Bennett's dream of winning the $10m X Prize, offered by a group of Americans to the first non-government organisation which can take three people 100 km - 62 miles - above the earth, bring them back safely, and reuse the spacecraft no more than two weeks later. </p> <p>The plan is for Nova to be launched on an unmanned test flight next summer before Mr Bennett straps himself in. If Nova succeeds, his company, Starchaser Industries, will go on to build its X Prize rocket, to be named Thunderbird after the sci-fi puppet series which fired Mr Bennett's imagination as a child. </p> <p>At 12, he opened an account with a laboratory supplies company and began launching miniature rockets from behind his family's council house in Dukinfield, Greater Manchester. </p> <p>After various jobs, including a spell in the army, he settled down as a soap and toothpaste analyst at Colgate Palmolive. Some of the time at Colgate was spent manufacturing rocket fuel out of sugar on the sly.\"I guess as a kid I was a closet pyromaniac,\" he said. \"My favourite time of year was bonfire night. The alchemists and wizards, they summoned up demonic forces and made them do their bidding. That's just what rocketry is all about.\"</p>",
  "Rule number one for all who fish in these waters: never attach too much significance to a single opinion poll. What matters is the trend. If a poll is out of line with the trend, breathe deeply and wait to see if later polls confirm a new trend is upon us. Which means that the Conservatives should not be too disconsolate, nor Labour too overjoyed, at the Gallup poll in the Daily Telegraph at the end of last week which suggested that the government's summer blip might be over. The time for joy or disconsolation will be tomorrow, when the Guardian will give the results of its latest ICM poll. <p>Our guess is that the figures may give rather more pleasure to Labour than to the Conservatives. This comes from the sense that Labour in the past two or three weeks has wrested back control of the agenda. Before that, William Hague had been making the running and Labour was running scared. But then came Gordon Brown's announcement of a hefty, and overdue, boost for public spending. That thumped a message across which most people were eager to hear. We know, it said, that the services you depend on are nowhere near good enough and we plan to deploy all the resources we can to give you the deal you deserve. It is only a promise, of course, and promises have been broken before, and saying you mean to do something is a long way from delivering. But here at least was a message of hope: and engendering hope is good for political parties. </p> <p>A further aspect of Gallup needs noting in the light of Labour's midsummer panic. The persistent theme of all those lugubrious memos - Philip Gould several times to Tony Blair, Tony Blair to his close associates - was that Labour had drifted out of touch with the electorate. Gallup seems to endorse that: 65% of respondents agreed with the Blair/Gould judgment that Tony Blair and his government were \"somehow out of touch with gut British interests\"; 32% disagreed. In a further show of solidarity with Labour's memo-producers, 55% per cent did not trust the government, against 41% who did. </p> <p>These are worrying figures for a government not so far away from a general election. And yet they are only part of the picture. What Gallup suggested last week was that, while 65% faulted the government for failing to tap the national gut, a commanding 47% still none the less thought they would vote Labour in a general election tomorrow, against 32% (hardly better than at their nadir in 1997) who would back the Conservatives. And Labour had a 10-point lead over the Tories as the party best equipped to steer the nation through economic trouble; and a mighty 87% (including 79% of intending Conservative voters) backed the boost for government spending. Crucially, too, though this poll was taken too early to reflect any possible lift for Mr Hague from the news of his drinking feats in Rotherham in his youth, almost half the electorate rated Tony Blair as the leader best equipped to run the country, against just 22% (10 points below the figure of those who said they would vote Conservative) who think Mr Hague is the man for the job. </p> <p>In other words: the government is not perfect; there is much that it needs to work on; but the nation sees it, quite rightly, as streets ahead of the only real alternative. On this evidence - we shall need to watch whether subsequent figures confirm the pattern - the kind of nervy improvisations which followed Philip Gould's warnings a couple of months ago may be at least as great a threat to its reputation as any of the omens that so much trouble its leader.</p>",
  "<p>What we would like to call the boss and what professional protocol demands of us might be two very different things. Two men with novel attitudes to their status in society have recently tested office attitudes to 21st-century formality. </p> <p>First up was newly knighted Financial Services Authority chairman Howard Davies, who, by practising modesty in the workplace, is also raising funds for his favourite football team, Manchester City. Davies has imposed a penalty of \u00a31 on anyone who dares calls him \"Sir\" - a title that no doubt comes loaded with one too many school-day memories. </p> <p>It was an anonymous source that spilt the beans on their rather less reticent senior at BT, where Sir Peter Bonfield was apparently prepared to go global with his new title. Insiders claim that he has tacked his knighthood on to his email address - it now reads, rather loftily, sir.peter.bonfield@ ...</p> <p>But who decides what we call the boss - them or us? Popular titles through the ages differ in sentiment and have included variations on guv, chief, boss, cheese, honcho or just plain old wanker. Opinion seems to be divided on how a name is arrived at. </p> <p>\"I think that it's not so much that you are obliged to call a boss by their title - I'd say if it was a very senior manager, you would address them as they wished,\" says Julie Amber, conference manager for the Industrial Society. \"Partly because of their seniority and partly through courtesy. Titles confirm hierarchy and those that use them want that hierarchy emphasised.\" So what does she make of bosses who want to be addressed by their title? \"I can understand that if someone has worked hard for a title and are proud of it, they would want it acknowledged, but I wouldn't do it myself,\" she says, diplomatically. </p> <p>\"It's certainly not a very empowering way to work. It creates an us-and-them situation with work ers and management, which usually results in people feeling that they don't really have a stake in their organisation. Hierarchy is a way to command and control and it certainly doesn't sit very well in the 21st century,\" Amber explains. </p> <p>Rank and position aside, even the formal use of \"Mr\" is proving to be a bit too last-century for most. Judy Fisher, of recruitment consultants Judy Fisher Associates, says of her experience: \"Of all our current clients I can think of only one boss who likes to be called Mr. It's very unusual these days for anyone not to be called by their first names. Our temps even call Sir Richard Eyre 'Richard'. </p> <p>\"I can only ever remember one of our clients, an elderly peer of the realm, who insisted on being called by his title. Even then everyone called him Lordy.\" </p> <p>Richard Grace, managing director of secretarial recruiters Gordon Yates, believes that there is, however, a place for more formal attitudes in the office. \"Titles are a bit like verbal dress codes. Nine times out of 10 you would formally address the boss the first time you met them as Mr, and Ms is always a good compromise,\" he says. \"I would advise that you should not take too many liberties with names and to always err on the side of caution, unless otherwise advised.\" </p> <p>Rachel Finbow, operations manager of Recruitment Employment Services, recommends waiting for a hint from the boss. \"We tend to tell our workers to address bosses how they refer to themselves. Ninety-five percent of our bosses are referred to by their first names. It's only the old fashioned companies, such as surveyors, accountants and law firms, and usually the older clients, that want you to call them 'Mr So-and-so'.\" </p> <p>Finbow believes that the thorny issue of whether to address a female boss as \"Miss\", \"Mrs\" or \"Ms\" can be avoided with an informal touch. \"We've got lots of female bosses and I can't think of one who wants to be referred to by their surname,\" she says. \"I would never advise using the term 'Ms'. People aren't comfortable with it and it certainly doesn't flow very easily.\" So, if \"Mr\" is too formal, and \"Ms\" too tricky, who could blame office workers for coming up with a name of their own? \"Sir\" and \"Old fart\" could, after all, be interchangeable titles.</p>",
  "Tensions were rising in the northern Kosovo town of Mitrovice yesterday amid signs of an imminent security operation described by UN officials as an attempt to \"regain control\" of the region. <p>A company of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, was reported to have been drafted in from its base in Pristina. </p> <p>Ten people were arrested in the Serb-dominated part of Mitrovice on Saturday night and a cache of grenades, ammunition and radios was seized by French K-For troops. </p> <p>At the same time, a Serb radio station, Radio S, was ordered to close after UN officials said it had failed to apply for a broadcasting licence. </p> <p>Reports in the local press have been predicting a raid on the lucrative Zvecan smelting works, which is part of the Trepca mining complex and has been blamed by the UN for high pollution levels in the town. </p> <p>The factory, which ethnic Albanians long to control, is currently run by Serb authorities and employs at least 4,000 people. </p> <p>UN sources have confirmed that more troops are being brought into Mitrovice to seize control of the factory; the commander of British troops in Pristina was seen talking to UN officials in the town yesterday. </p> <p>Danish soldiers positioned to the north of the town are also expected to be redeployed to Mitrovice. </p> <p>Officials say that the operation will be part of a broader attempt to establish the UN's control of the region; municipal authorities are expected to be targeted, with members of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling Serbian Socialist party, who have been accused of trying to wrest control of the town, arrested and expelled. </p> <p>Mitrovice has been an embarrassment to the UN's mission in Kosovo since its peacekeeping troops took control of it in June 1999. Serb men, known as \"bridge watchers\", equipped with Motorola radios appear to control much of Mitrovice, stopping cars and checking people's identities. </p> <p>The self-appointed leader of the Serb community in Mitrovice, Oliver Ivanovic, has predicted an angry reaction to plans to take over the smelter. </p> <p>Mr Ivanovic said he was planning to hold demonstrations today if the factory is taken over. </p> <p>\"We have to deal with people's fear for their jobs. They are afraid for their future. They are afraid that K-For and [the UN administration] Unmik will bring in Albanians to the north [of the segregated town].\"</p>",
  "<p>Buildings: without them you'd get cold and wet. And people would be able to nick your stuff when you went out (not that it'd be going \"out\" if there was nothing to exit from). And you'd have to mark out your territory with piles of jackets like make-do goalposts in the park lest someone invaded your space when you weren't there. Or you could live in a cave, but there aren't as many as there used to be. Which begs the question: where have all the caves gone? </p> <p>Of course, it's not just practicality that makes buildings great. It's the aesthetic that captivates us, inspires awe. Architecture, is, as Goethe said, frozen music. In <strong> Building Of The Year</strong> (C4, Sun), Waldemar Januszczak gave us a tour of the contenders for the Stirling Prize, the Royal Institute of British Architects' accolade for the greatest new building, and each, in its own way, was a glacial concerto. </p> <p>From the Kilder Belvedere deep in the Northumbrian forest to the London Eye and Canary Wharf Station, from Latern House in the Lake District - which looked like JK Rowling had had a hand in its design - to my personal favourite, the Great Glasshouse at the National Botanic Garden of Wales, these were constructs which defined the here and now and will be how posterity remembers the early days of the 21st century. All curves, circles, domes and crescents, with nary a phallic tower among them, these buildings perhaps say more about our aesthetic development than any other field of art. </p> <p>Yet all the while the camera fetishised the curves of steel and arcs of glass, there was the nagging feeling that each building would be a bugger to clean. How would the Shuttleworths keep the crescendo of windows on their Los Angeles-esque home smearless? Short of sending in a team of acrobats armed with Mr Muscle, how would the giant spokes of the London Eye maintain their gleamy whiteness? And how long before dust, dead bluebottles and litter sullied the underground cathedral of Canary Wharf Station? The panes of glass in Wales's Great Glasshouse were so strong you could walk on them, we were told, and so would be easy to clean. But what a lot of newspaper and vinegar you'd need. </p> <p>Who would have thought arthouse film-making methodology could be made so interesting, funny and smart? Yet this is exactly what <strong> The Name Of This Film Is Dogme 95</strong> (C4, Sat) achieved. Under the auspices of Richard Kelly, the film was a wholesome treat - vitamin-enriched ice cream, if you will - topped off with nuts (or at least, the slightly crackers Lars von Trier) and a sprinkling of Paprika Steen, Dogme 95's leading actress. </p> <p>Explaining the Dogme movement's \"vow of chastity\" between clips of films like Festen and The Idiots, Kelly's documentary pastiched its subject whilst illuminating it wonderfully. With input from film-makers, critics and the excellent Paprika (whose porn name might indeed be Cumin Mee), this was exemplary stuff. And oddly funny, especially when Soren Kragh-Jacobsen, one of the original Dogme brotherhood, compared the movement to Eric Clapton Unplugged. </p> <p>The<strong> Movie Virgins</strong> (C4, Sun) continued on their compelling-as-a-car-crash missions to make their first feature film. Alex was in Cannes trying to persuade Jude Law to star in his movie, while things were getting fraught in Leon's house as filming got under way, Leon coming over all autocratic and visionary. You could only laugh. </p> <p>The best moment of schadenfreude came when Alex actually met Jude, and Jude was snootily non-plussed by the wannabe director. As Jude and wife Sadie Frost were interviewed by Barry Norman - presumably to publicise their complete turkey of a movie, Final Cut - Alex waited patiently for a word in the actor's shell-like. He got half a syllable in before Jude stalked off with Nick Moran, shrieking \"Does anyone have any cigarettes?\" (Bizarre how these people are considered famous when the last thing Nick Moran did was a Barclays ad). As it turned out, Paul Nicholls read for the part, and we are on tenterhooks as to whether he'll take a part in the \"clubland thriller, Sorted\". We can only hope not. </p> <p>The thieving ways of Yogi Bear are alive and well in the bears of Yosemite National Park as <strong> Wildlife On One </strong> (BBC1, Sun) demonstrated. Like actors, bears are wonderfully cute until you see them at close quarters, when they are needy and snarling. Not a pretty sight at all.</p>",
  "The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is considering making a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission over a Mail on Sunday story which claims the college believes that having an abortion can increase a woman's chances of developing breast cancer. <p>The college is incensed by the front page story, which it describes as \"very inaccurate\" and \"the worst kind of journalism\". </p> <p>\"To say we have 'agreed there is a link' is completely false,\" said Allan Templeton, the college's honorary secretary and chairman of its guidelines development committee. \"This story will cause great anxiety, and we probably need to go to the Press Complaints Commission because it is totally inappropriate.\" </p> <p>The newspaper claimed that, after analysing US research, based on 28 separate studies, \"the RCOG has agreed there is a risk of developing cancer after a termination\". </p> <p>Millions of women would be warned by their doctors of the \"worrying link\", and the British Pregnancy Advisory Service - the biggest provider of abortions in the country - would echo this anxiety. </p> <p>Some 180,000 terminations are conducted each year in England and Wales and 12,000 in Scotland, with at least a third of all women having an abortion by the time they reach 45. </p> <p>But yesterday, the royal college said that, after assessing two reviews of all the available research on the subject, it was still not satisfied there was a link. </p> <p>\"We concluded that the evidence as it stood was inconclusive, that there was no evidence definitely pointing towards a link and that, on the other hand, there was much evidence that suggested there was no link at all,\" said Professor Templeton. </p> <p>The Mail on Sunday's story had been based on research, conducted by Joel Brind of the City University of New York, which suggested that women who terminate pregnancies run a 30% greater chance of developing breast cancer. </p> <p>But Prof Templeton cast doubt on the validity of this work, since it relied on case control studies in which women are required to be honest about whether they had had an abortion. </p> <p>Separate research has found that women with breast cancer are more likely to admit to having had an abortion, in the hope of shedding light on a possible cause, than healthier women, who are more preoccupied with stigma. </p> <p>In contrast, studies based on linking national registers of induced abortion with instances of breast cancer were less open to bias, said Prof Templeton. \"Two such studies have not shown any significant association,\" he added. </p> <p>He continued: \"The newspaper has taken one study out of context of the rest of the evidence ... When only those studies least susceptible to bias are included, the evidence suggests that induced abortion does not increase a woman's risk of breast cancer in later life.\" </p> <p>The consultant obstetrician also dismissed the newspaper's claims that, while pregnancy protects a woman from breast cancer, having an abortion deals a \"hormonal blow\" by exposing immature breast cells to carcinogens. </p> <p>The British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which sees 50,000 women a year, said it was \"infuriated\" by the claims made in the newspaper. </p> <p>\"This is dishonest journalism and we would certainly support the royal college in pursuing a complaint,\" a spokeswoman, Ann Ferudi, said.</p>",

  "It is easy from the comfort of a liberal enclave to condemn the anti-paedophile-mob violence (Leader, August 11). But such witch-hunting, however irrational and counter-productive, strikes a deep chord in the national psyche. All parents want their children to be safe and most know how hard it is to create real security. Mob hysteria is fuelled by the psychological mechanism of projection.

  "The South African government is expected to reject public clamour for a paedophile register in new sex offence legislation aimed at curbing some of the highest rates of child abuse in the world. <p>Public frustration with the authorities over a series of horrific crimes against children in recent weeks has focused on the case of Phillipus Briel, a convicted rapist due to appear in court today on charges of murdering his 15-year-old step-niece. </p> <p>Briel, who has been jailed several times for sex crimes, escaped from Sterkfontein psychiatric hospital three months ago. The police made no attempt to look for him even though he was considered a danger to children since committing his first rape at 15. </p> <p>Briel was living openly with his wife and her niece, Edith Erens. He allegedly strangled the girl before dumping her in a cemetery, and police suspect he raped her several times in the preceding weeks. Edith's murder is one of several cases that have fuelled demands for drastic measures to stop child abuse. Nearly 40,000 assaults on children were reported last year, a fraction of the real total. The rape of girls and boys under seven is sharply higher. </p> <p>Last week a mother and stepfather were convicted of selling their three young daughters for sex for as little as five rand (50p) a time. One of the girls was seven when she was first raped. Child welfare officials were disturbed that the only person prosecuted for abusing the girls was their stepfather's brother. </p> <p>On Friday, a Johannesburg school gardener and his assistant were remanded in custody accused of raping a 12-year-old pupil. The same day, two men appeared in court accused of kidnapping five children and imprisoning them in a cave for two weeks. </p> <p>Among extensive legal reforms to protect children will be a broader definition of rape to include any kind of sexual penetration, including with fingers and objects. And legislation will be changed so as to shield boys as well as girls. </p> <p>But Joan van Niekerk, chairperson of South Africa's Childline and a member of the committee drafting the legislation, says the law is unlikely to require a register of sex offenders. </p> <p>\"There's all this hype about registers but no one is looking at the hard core issues like who goes on to it and what difference does it make to sexual offences that are committed. </p> <p>\"The evidence from the US is that it [a register] doesn't reduce the number of offences. In a country like ours which has limited resources, why put our money into something that doesn't work simply because it's an emotional response to the problem?\"she asked. </p> <p>One reason a paedophile register is deemed of limited value is that the vast majority of sexual offences against children in South Africa are committed within the family. </p> <p>Mrs van Niekerk says the more urgent need is to ensure that paedophiles are monitored and treated after their release from prison because so many return to live with the children they assaulted. </p> <p>The government has already taken some steps to curb child abuse, including lengthening sentences for the rape of minors and introducing special courts in some areas. </p> <p>Mrs van Niekerk says the new courts are welcome because the judicial system has often proved an added abuse of the victims. The average child sex abuse case takes 18 months to come to trial, and victims are frequently subjected to gruelling court appearances. </p> <p>But persuading children or their parents to report sexual assaults is difficult. \"We see children grossly intimidated by the men in their families who commit these crimes, or gangs. It can be very dangerous for them. We have children and families in hiding because they have reported sexual crimes,\" Mrs van Niekerk said. </p> <p>Pressuring magistrates to change their attitudes can also be a problem. Child protection agencies were outraged recently when a retired soldier, Ian Middleton, walked out of court with a fine of 6,000 rand (\u00a3600) for luring boys onto his luxury yacht and raping them.</p>",
  "Litigation made the name of journalist Simon Regan, who has died aged 58. His most distinguished plaintiff, in 1993, was John Major. Regan, in his magazine Scallywag, had falsely accused the then prime minister of having an affair with Clare Latimer, a Downing Street caterer. Major and Latimer issued writs against Scallywag, its distributor and printer, and against the rather longer established New Statesman. Later Regan, and Scallywag's distributors, were worsted in a legal action brought by Julian Lewis, now a Conservative MP. <p>While legal matters gave Scallywag's founding editor a high public profile, they did not boost its life expectancy. It was, observed Regan in 1999, \"libelled out of existence by actions against innocent retailers\". But, he went on to argue, it had first published many allegations which later received wider publicity. </p> <p>In the 1980s, Regan was living in Weymouth, working as a PR and editing, as a one-man operation - supported by Smartie the parrot and Smokey the cat - Butterfly News. With this magazine, he took on Coca-Cola, the National Farmers Union and the butterfly establishment. </p> <p>Scallywag too began in Dorset. Regan was inspired by Private Eye of the early 1960s, but his magazine started with a narrower range of targets: estate agents, local councils and the nearby brewery. </p> <p>Some 66 issues later he returned to London. With two of his brothers he set up Scallywag as a London, and then, purportedly, a national magazine. Unlike Private Eye, which had succumbed to the lawyers' embrace and in his opinion had been tamed, Scallywag took its chances. But, as anyone who has had connections with such magazines can testify, this is a brisk path to the law courts. There was understandable talking up of its success. Alleged print-runs fuzzed into circulation figures; there was hope, when Major launched his legal attack, of a 100,000 circulation. </p> <p>Regan was born and raised in Hampstead in a multi-tenanted mansion owned by his grandmother, surrounded by card-carrying communists and eccentric east European intellectuals. Educated at Haverstock Hill Comprehensive school, he began his writing career in his teens with poems in John O'London's magazine. He became a journalist in Weymouth before joining the News of the World in 1967. </p> <p>The NoW (\"as British as roast beef and Yorkshire pudding\" as its veteran editor Stafford Sommerfield proclaimed) was one year away from takeover by the then Australian Rupert Murdoch. But its 1940s-austerity diet of sex and scandal was boosted by Regan with his \"probes\" into counter-cultural drugs, debauchery and Trotskyite student conspiracy. He was, he explained in the Guardian this year, smoking a lot of dope, and turning on senior NoW staff, Sommerfield included, with his cannabis-infused cake-mix gateaux. </p> <p>Regan left the NoW in the mid-1970s. Undistinguished biographies of Prince Charles, Princess Margaret and Rupert Murdoch followed. In 1981 he attracted considerable publicity when he obtained what he claimed were transcripts of affectionate phone conversations between Prince Charles and his fianc\u00e9e Lady Diana Spencer. An injunction followed. Then came the return to Weymouth, butterflies and Scallywag. </p> <p>After its death on the news-stands, the magazine lived on, until two years ago, on the Internet. It was a curiously contemporary resort for a journalist whose career was the stuff of George Gissing's great Victorian novel of hackery, New Grub Street. He penned a sub-Auberon Waugh column dedicated to misogyny; through all that work there is a pervasive tone of desperate, old-devil Tory nihilism. But what would one expect from a man who described himself as a \"rude, farting, lob-sided, unmarried, unemployed drunken bastard with three balls and a kinky rib\"? </p> <p>He married three times and had eight daughters. </p> <p>\u0095 Simon Regan, journalist, born August 7 1942; died August 8 2000</p>",
  "We escaped from the holiday tourists swarming around the crash and thunder of Aira Force to the lonely quietude of Gowbarrow Fell. Just below us, on the Ullswater shore, was \"the margin of a bay\" where Wordsworth saw his host of golden daffodils, around the head of the lake clustered the Helvellyn heights and, across the water, the steeps of Place Fell filled the sky. <p>Away from the crowded excitements of the waterfall we heard nothing, apart from the mewing of a buzzard soaring in slow spirals overhead, and we saw nobody on the two-mile walk to the summit. But there was, indeed, much to be seen. Far below our steadily rising track stretched the three reaches of Ullswater, which many consider the most beautiful of all the lakes, and, dotted along the surface, like butterflies on a pond, were dozens of yachts. They were barely moving - it was a windless day - but, returning along a similar route an hour or two later, we could see that the flotilla seemed to be creeping in the opposite direction. Clearly, some sort of a race, but an extremely leisurely one.</p> <p>Halfway to the summit, and still marked on the map, is a relic of Victorian sporting days, a shooting box. Forty years ago this substantial, roofed structure was a convenient shelter in bad weather: today, it's just a tumble of stones. Dawdling along the track that almost encircles the fell I remembered great days in summer and winter, climbing and skiing on the surrounding heights, and also a July day 45 years ago when, from the Glenridding shore, I watched Donald Campbell lift the world's water speed record to 200 miles an hour. And, 12 years later, a sad January morning when I watched him, an old friend, somersaulting to his death on Coniston Water at 300 miles an hour. Exciting memories, although Gowbarrow Fell - apart from its crashing Aira Force - is hardly an exciting summit, just a lonely one. But Green Hill, on the way down, is a superb viewpoint if you want to look at lakes and mountains in all their glory and the rising footpath, behind Lyulph's Tower, an easily-attained delight. </p> <p>\u0095 The Coniston Tigers - Published by Sigma Press</p>",
  "If police corruption merited an entry in the Guinness Book of Records, Arturo \"El Negro\" Durazo, who has died aged 80, would be a strong contender for the title. In Mexico, where the words police and corruption are inseparably linked in the public mind, Durazo's six-year reign as the capital's police chief (1976-82) turned him into the definition of the phenomenon. <p>Yet he is also remembered fondly by many as the man whose mano dura (strong-arm) methods made the streets of Mexico City safe for ordinary citizens. </p> <p>Born in the northern border state of Sonora, Durazo moved to the capital very young. He studied business administration and worked in the central bank from 1944; in 1948, he discovered his vocation as a policeman, switching careers to traffic inspector and then to being an agent of the much-feared Federal Security Directorate (DFS). He was credited with uncovering the activities in Mexico of Cuban exiles under Fidel Castro; in the mid-1950s they plotted the overthrow of the Batista dictatorship. </p> <p>The DFS arrested Castro, along with Che Guevara and other members of the group, but they were eventually released due to political pressure. Durazo was DFS commander from 1958-62. He went on to found the Crime Prevention Investigations Division (DIPD), whose brutality terrified both criminals and the urban guerrillas who were active in the early 1970s. </p> <p>The stroke of luck that sent Durazo's career into the stratosphere was the nomination of his childhood friend, Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo, as presidential candidate for the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 1976. Durazo became L\u00f3pez Portillo's personal security chief, and when the man assumed the presidency he was rewarded with command of the Mexico City police. </p> <p>Eleven months earlier, as L\u00f3pez Portillo well knew, Durazo had been indicted by a US grand jury on narcotics charges. But the president's prime consideration, as he once declared, was that he knew Durazo would protect him with his own life. El Negro had a well-deserved reputation for placing loyalty to his friends above everything else. Once he was in the job, he reported directly to the president, bypassing his ostensible boss, Mexico City's mayor. </p> <p>\"Durazo converted the police into a racketeering empire that made his predecessors' performances seem positively innocuous,\" wrote Alan Riding in Distant Neighbours, his book about 1980s Mexico. The sources of his rapidly growing illicit wealth were many, from the bribes paid by every cop in the city to the cocaine trade and kickbacks on the purchase of police equipment. </p> <p>The president granted him, by decree, the rank of general and El Negro began to behave like a mini-dictator. When his convoy of vehicles was on the move, roads were sealed to ensure his security and speed his progress. </p> <p>But despite the excesses, Durazo was much admired - both at home and abroad - for his crime prevention. A Soviet delegation went so far as to declare him \"the best police chief in the world\". </p> <p>Mexico's inhabitants mostly neither knew nor - presumably - cared about the methods his dipos (as the DIPD detectives were known) used to keep crime under control. But when the bodies of 12 Colombians, alleged to be bank-robbers, were found in the Tula River with clear signs that they had been tortured and executed, questions began to be asked. </p> <p>Durazo's downfall came in 1982 with the accession to the presidency of Miguel de la Madrid, who had made moral renewal a theme of his campaign. El Negro then prudently left the country, but the details of his wealth, and its origins, were revealed in a book by his former personal aide, Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3nzalez, which became a runaway bestseller. Durazo later won a libel case against G\u00f3nzalez - from inside his prison cell. </p> <p>During his ascendancy, Durazo had built himself a $2.5m mansion on the outskirts of Mexico City, with a horse-racing track and a replica of the Studio 54 discotheque in New York. In the Pacific coast resort of Zihuatanejo, his cliff-top retreat, complete with classical columns, was nicknamed the Parthenon. </p> <p>In January, 1984, he was finally charged (in absentia) with tax evasion. Two months later the charges were expanded to include extortion, smuggling and possession of illegal weapons, and the government formally sought his extradition from the US. </p> <p>He was arrested in Puerto Rico later that year, extradited to Mexico and sentenced to 25 years in prison, although in fact he served less than eight. His Mexico City palace was opened as a museum of corruption and proved a popular attraction. </p> <p>Paroled in 1992, he retired to Acapulco and, by some accounts, spent his declining years helping alcoholics to kick the habit. At his memorial service, former president L\u00f3pez Portillo (himself one of the most reviled political figures in the country) defended El Negro. Praising his courage and honesty, he said he had lost \"a friend and a great collaborator. He was a magnificent policeman, by vocation and by devotion.\" </p> <p>Durazo is survived by his wife, Silvia Garza, and their four sons. </p> <p>\u0095 Arturo Durazo Moreno (El Negro Durazo); police chief turned criminal, born 1920; died August 5 2000</p>",
  "As Birmingham University's deputy director of physical education from 1946-59, Peter McIntosh, who has died aged 84, was influential in developing Britain's first PE degree. He also drafted the paper delivered by Nobel Peace Prize-winner Lord Philip Noel-Baker at the 1960 Rome Olympics, which led to the formation of the International Council of sport, science and physical education. <p>Probably his best known book was Sport In Society (1963). Updated in 1987, it became an A level PE and sports studies text. McIntosh enthused generations of teachers, and that book was a remarkable social analysis of sport across history. </p> <p>The sixth child of a family from Acton, west London, he won a scholarship to Mill Hill School, and then graduated in classics from Lincoln College, Oxford. That background helped establish him as a leading historian of sport and PE, well-known for his studies of games in ancient Greece and Rome. His chapter on the sociology of sport in the ancient world in Luschen and Sage's Handbook Of Social Science Of Sport (1981) drew parallels between social issues contextualising sport in ancient and contemporary societies. </p> <p>McIntosh was a key figure in the formation of the Sports Council and served on it from 1966-74. Straddling the PE and sports worlds, he was a senior PE inspector with the Inner London Education Authority (1959-74) leading a team which revolutionised the activity. </p> <p>The ILEA turned again to McIntosh to lead a 1988 inquiry, when it was under pressure because of the debate over competition in school sport and PE. McIntosh's highly regarded report, My Favourite Subject, was a thoughtful, direct analysis showing that children liked PE and arguing that curriculum time should be given to PE and sport. </p> <p>McIntosh was a man of principle, a pacifist who worked in the Friends Relief instead of military service. As a professional, he created opportunities for participation in physical activity, especially for the underprivileged. </p> <p>He and his wife Eunice shared five children from their first marriages. </p> <p>\u0095 Peter Chisholm McIntosh, physical educationalist, born November 25 1915; died July 22 2000</p>",
  "Beaujolais Nouveau lovers, be warned: the producers of France's most-hyped young wine say that unless they find an extra 30,000 grape-pickers soon the annual cork-popping ritual of the third Thursday in November may be somewhat muted this year. <p>\"I'm not sure what exactly the problem is,\" the president of the Beaujolais wine board, Marc Le Brun, said, \"but it seems no one wants to pick grapes any more. I wouldn't quite say we're panicking, but there are only about two weeks to go before harvest time and we're a long, long way short of the 40,000 people we need.\" </p> <p>Made from Gamay grapes harvested in early September, 55m bottles of two-month-old Beaujolais Nouveau are rushed to 190 countries in time for the annual festivities. With a flavour that has been compared to bananas, crushed raspberries, and even English humbugs, the wine offers the first official taste of the new French vintage. </p> <p>This year, however, the regional growers - including producers of such serious wines as Morgon, Moulin-\u00e0-Vent, Fleurie and Pouilly-Fuiss\u00e9 - just cannot get the staff. </p> <p>The students who used to end their summer holidays with a week in the sun are turning their noses up at the backbreaking work, and with France in the middle of an economic upswing the unemployed are not much interested in the pay. </p> <p>One grower, Jean-Pierre Monnot, said an additional factor was that EU regulations meant few producers could accommodate and feed their pickers without breaking the law. </p> <p>Unless matters improve, Mr le Brun said, the Burgundy growers will have to consider using machines, currently denied any grower who wants to retain his vital appellation control\u00e9e status, although the regulatory body has promised to listen favourably to growers' arguments at its next meeting, in the third week of November.</p>",
  "A 10-year-old girl is being tipped to become the spiritual leader of Brazil's most famous Afro-Brazilian religious community. <p>In Candomble, the animistic religion developed by slaves from west Africa, the house of worship known as Gantois, in the eastern city of Salvador, has a special significance. If Andrea Millet is named \"holy mother\" there, she would become an important national symbol of black culture. </p> <p>The succession will be decided officially by the throwing of six seashells and seeing how they land, which in the religion's culture is how the gods make their choice known to the material world. </p> <p>However, the tradition at Gantois has always been for leadership to be passed down to a close female relative. There is strong speculation that the gods will chose Ms Millet, the granddaughter of the previous holy mother. </p> <p>Worshippers have just finished a week of ceremonies marking the 14th anniversary yesterday of the death of their penultimate leader, which clears the way for the new selection within 30 days. </p> <p>Gantois is the best known community of Candomble. Services are often held in Yoruba, an African language, using songs that have been passed down over hundreds of years. </p> <p>The importance of Gantois is due to Maria Escolastica de Nazare, known as \"Mother Little Girl\", who was holy mother there for 64 years before her death, aged 92, in 1986. </p> <p>The country's most charismatic and longstanding Candomble leader, she oversaw the religion's transformation from a hidden cult to an accepted and cherished part of Brazilian heritage. </p> <p>Mother Little Girl was also one of the first Candomble leaders to attract the interest of the white middle classes, when leftwing intellectuals sought refuge within Candomble communities amid the climate of intolerance of the 1950s. </p> <p>Prominent Brazilians including the novelist Jorge Amado, the singer Caetano Veloso and the senate leader Antonio Carlos Magalhaes - all sought her counsel and consider themselves \"children of Gantois\". </p> <p>\"She modernised Candomble without letting it be exploited by tourists. She had prestige because of the credibility she inspired. She never gave up her convictions,\" the historian Cid Teixeira said. </p> <p>Brazil's economy was based on slavery for centuries. The country received more slaves than any other in the west, with most coming through the northeastern state of Bahia. Almost 80% of the population of the state capital, Salvador, is black or of mixed race. </p> <p>Despite Candomble's underground popularity in Bahia, its followers suffered persecution until a law requiring police permission to hold ceremonies was scrapped in the 1970s. </p> <p>The liberalisation coincided with a dramatic growth in worship. In Bahia there are now 3,670 separate Candomble communities. </p> <p>\"I have no doubt that the state has more Candomble houses than it has churches,\" said Antoniel Ataide Bispo, secretary of the Bahian Federation of Afro-Brazilian Worship. </p> <p>In Brazil overall, about 80% of the population is Catholic, making it the world's largest Catholic country. </p> <p>Candomble is now an important part of black identity. In Salvador there are giant sculptures of its orixas - its gods - in the city centre lake. </p> <p>After Mother Little Girl's death the Gantois leadership was passed to her daughter Cleuza. With Cleuza's death in 1998 the house has been in the transition period between holy mothers that can take up to three years. </p> <p>Because of the history of Gantois - the name comes from the French slave trafficker Fran\u00e7ois Gantois who had a property on the land where the house is situated - there is wide regional interest in the succession. </p> <p>The two women thought most likely to be chosen are Cleuza's sister Carmen and Andrea. Cleuza's daughter has reportedly ruled herself out. </p> <p>There is concern that Andrea is too young to take on the job of holy mother, which gives her the responsibility to dispense advice and coordinate the rituals. Mother Little Girl was 28 when she started. </p> <p>Shortly before she died Cleuza appeared to single out the youngest relative. </p> <p>\"Andrea has such a capacity for looking after the [religious energy] that has surprised me. She is only seven, but she is very dedicated and serious,\" she said.</p>"
