  "<p>An unfamiliar line-up but, for Manchester United, a familiar outcome. Their third humbling of Bradford in little more than eight months hoisted the champions to the Premiership's summit here last night and on this evidence they will take some shifting. </p> <p>Their objective was achieved with the minimum of fuss, courtesy of two goals from Teddy Sheringham and Quinton Fortune and one apiece from Andy Cole and David Beckham. Poor Bradford hardly knew what hit them. </p> <p>A combination of injuries and, in Roy Keane's case, suspension meant Sir Alex Ferguson fielded an - ostensibly - weakened team, one more in keeping with United's usual dips into the Worthington Cup than the Premiership. </p> <p>So Jonathan Greening, Ronnie Wallwork and Fortune were elevated from the reserves while Beckham continued where he left off in Paris at the weekend by operating in his preferred central role. </p> <p>As United had grossed eight without reply in their two previous meetings with Bradford, it was no surprise Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes started on the bench. </p> <p>After a strangely muted opening the hosts were quickly into their rhythm and once Cole had put them ahead in the 11th minute the first waves of deja vu must have gripped away fans. </p> <p>It was a goal owing much to luck but after his Parisian labours Cole will not complain. Scampering clear on the right of the penalty area,. Cole was found by Sheringham's inch-perfect pass. Cole's first-time shot should not have carried much danger to Matt Clarke but the ball ricocheted off Peter Atherton's instep, looping over the stranded goalkeeper into an empty net. </p> <p>If Bradford felt hard done by, it was nothing compared with the bristling sense of injustice oozing from every Yorkshire pore when United doubled their lead 12 minutes later. </p> <p>In the build-up Gary Neville had won possession by scything through the back of Dean Windass's calves. Inexplicably, it went unpunished by the referee Rob Harris and United steamed upfield. Beckham crossed from the right and, even though Cole missed his header, Fortune was loitering to pounce on the leftovers with an emphatic left-foot shot. </p> <p>By that point United's accountants had probably seen enough to start counting out another round of win bonuses. Beckham, efficient but unspectacular, had a free-kick turned against the post by Clarke and for all Benito Carbone's intelligent promptings Bradford's counter-attacks were few and far between. </p> <p>After the interval United could even indulge in some show-boating, Fabien Barthez shooting from a free-kick 70 yards out before Fortune showed him how to do it with a tremendous dipping shot on the hour for United's third. </p> <p>Eleven minutes later Sheringham made it 4-0 with a spectacular right-foot volley from 20 yards out. Then on 81 minutes the veteran forward completed a personal double with a far-post header from a Greening cross, to the delight of a 67,447 crowd. </p> <p>When Beckham added the icing on the cake with a 20-yard bobbling shot, the roar might have been heard at empty Maine Road.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Patricia White, 24 </strong> IT consultant </p> <p>I once worked on a project where I was told by a contractor that we'd never get the job done in time. Rather than going back to my boss I braved it out, convinced that we'd finish it on schedule. I was wrong and the project was a month overdue. My boss was furious. I was about to start work on a similar project and, fearful that I might lose my job, I wrote a proposal of how I would update my boss every week and would notify him of any problems. I think if you make a mistake not only have you got to say, \"It won't happen again,\" you have to prove it. </p> <p><strong> Sarah Stowe, 38 </strong> editor </p> <p> I used to work for a publishing house where you were allocated an art editor per issue from a studio team. I always got the useless one because everyone else complained about her. I felt used and sent a memo to the MD and head of the art department explaining how I felt. Because I'd made a formal complaint I was hauled up in front of the board. Everyone knew this woman was rubbish, but for some reason they couldn't sack her. The MD was furious. The whole situation taught me to be a little bit more diplomatic. </p> <p><strong> Steven Jensen, 56 </strong> marketing consultant </p> <p> I used to work for an import/export company and forgot to include the distributor's profit margin in the calculations. When the first shipment arrived, I realised that something was horribly wrong and saw what I'd done. I tried to build in some extra profit without telling my boss, but it just wasn't possible. In the end I had to be brutally honest and own up to my mistake. I managed to hold on to my job mainly because I just owned up. </p> <p><strong> Sally Fisher, 29 </strong> recruitment consultant </p> <p> I used to work as a catering manager and it was my responsibility to check my section every night. I didn't notice that one of my staff put about \u00a32,000 worth of frozen food in a fridge by mistake and the next day it was ruined. I went to my boss and told him about it as if it were a bit of salacious gossip. I tried to blame the person who'd made the mistake, although he worked for me and I was ultimately responsible for his actions. After that I was put on a trial period because my bosses wanted to see if I could take my responsibility seriously. I learnt that it's your attitude to mistakes as much as your actions that bosses assess. </p> <p><strong> Clare Morris, 31 </strong> PR executive </p> <p> I once jammed up the switchboard for the whole of the West End after I told a journalist that a particular stockist number had four or five lines when I knew it only had one. Consequently, my boss had the editor of a national newspaper yelling at her on the telephone. Looking back on it now I cringe, but at the time I was really cocky. I just shrugged my shoulders and said: \"Well the client got loads of publicity didn't he?\" I just brazened it out. I think my boss was so taken aback that she didn't mention it again. Sometimes you have to brush these things off and just get on with your job.</p>",
  "Voters were given a taste yesterday of the general election battle ahead when William Hague unveiled his outline manifesto, including plans to reform the basic state pension. It prompted a swift Labour warning that the Tories would endanger people's financial security in retirement. <p>In an echo of the pensions row which killed John Major's election campaign in 1997, Labour accused the Tories of planning backdoor privatisation after Mr Hague announced plans to allow young people to opt out of the basic state pension. </p> <p>The Labour onslaught, involving three cabinet ministers led by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, was launched within hours of Mr Hague's launch of the pre-election manifesto. Mr Prescott said the plans would lead to public spending cuts of \u00a316bn, a charge rejected by the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, who described the document as fiscally neutral. </p> <p>However, Mr Portillo refused to spell out the Tories' tax and spending plans, saying they would have to wait till later. </p> <p>One of the most eye-catching ideas in the document is a plan to encourage young people to save for retirement through a state-funded alternative to the basic state pension. Those who opt for the scheme would be given a monthly sum - equivalent to the amount which would fund their state pension - to place in a private or occupational scheme. </p> <p>David Willetts, the shadow social security secretary, denied that the plan amounted to privatisation by the back door. He insisted that nobody would be forced to opt out of the state pension. </p> <p>\"We want to make it easier for people to put more money into real funded pensions by giving them this freedom to opt out from the basic state pension and instead put that money towards a personal pension,\" he said. </p> <p>The social security secretary, Alistair Darling, called the proposal a \"privatisation agenda for the basic pension\". </p> <p>In the document, entitled Believing in Britain, the Tories signalled their determination to cut public spending in every area apart from health and education. Mr Hague plans to: </p> <p>\u0095 End local authority control of schools by funding them directly from Whitehall; </p> <p>\u0095 End state funding of universities by setting up independent endowments funded by future government auctions; </p> <p>\u0095 End day-to-day ministerial control over the NHS by restricting the government's role to setting a strategic framework for the health service; </p> <p>\u0095 Restricting public spending increases to the growth in the economy, which would see a cut of 1.1 percentage points on Labour's planned spending. </p> <p>\"As businesses become more mobile, Conservative Britain will be cutting taxes,\" he said. \"We may be the fourth largest economy in the world, but you wouldn't know it if you visited some of our schools.\" </p> <p>He made clear that he hopes to tap into growing Euroscepticism by resisting attempts by Brussels to impose a \"fully integrated superstate\". He pledged to legislate to prevent the EU interfering in key areas such as taxation. </p> <p>\"Let me set the Tories a \u00a316bn challenge,\" Mr Prescott said. \"Name the schools you will shut, name the hospitals you will close, name the law and order budget you will cut.\"</p>",
  "<p>The eyes of the global oil markets will be on Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia when he takes the rostrum at the United Nations millennium summit in New York today. Dealers will be scrutinising every word to see whether the world's biggest producer is prepared to open the taps and pump enough oil to bring down the price of a barrel of crude, which is running at more than $32 - the highest level since Iraq invaded Kuwait 10 years ago. </p> <p>With dearer fuel pushing up inflation in Europe and casting a shadow over the US presidential elections, the west is hoping that the Saudis will turn up at next week's meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in Vienna with a plan that will persuade the more hawkish members of the 11-nation cartel to join an agreement that would allow higher production. </p> <p>America has been putting most of the pressure on Opec to raise production but the European Union is concerned enough to float the idea of a world competition authority which would bust the cartel apart. </p> <p>The signs that Opec will relent and raise production are not good. Although the Saudi oil sheiks have always been a moderating influence in Opec - even during the two oil shocks of the 70s - they are reluctant to be seen as poodles of the United States. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the president of Opec, the Venezuelan energy minister Ali Rodriguez, has been touring the world's oil producing countries pushing the case for keeping prices at current levels. In a world that is witnessing an ever bigger gulf between rich and poor, Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, said last month: \"We don't want prices to drop below their present level. Lower prices would be like passing a death sentence on ourselves and our people.\" </p> <p><strong> Global demand</strong><br> </p> <p>Venezuela - and some other Opec members - say the west should take some responsibility for the high price consumers pay at the pump, and that rich nations could blunt the impact of rising crude if their finance ministries chose to be less greedy. In the wealthy countries that make up the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, fuel duties account for 60% of the pump price while crude oil accounts for just 12%. Environmentalists, who support higher duties, point out that very little of the revenue raised from fuel duties has found its way into investment in the development of new and clean energy. </p> <p>The economic reasons for rising oil prices are simple. Global demand has picked up since the devaluation in Brazil in early 1999 marked the end of the financial crisis that started in Thailand 18 months earlier. America has defied the gloomy pundits, European growth has been robust and even Japan has shown some signs of emerging from its 10-year period in the doldrums. At the same time, Opec - while by no means the force it was when it brought an end to the long post-war boom with a fivefold increase in oil prices in 1973 - was forced by the dramatic slide in the cost of crude to less than $10 a barrel to stitch together a deal limiting supply. It has chosen its moment well, with stocks in the US at historically low levels. Stronger demand plus restricted supply equal higher prices. </p> <p>The question is: how high can they go? Insiders say talk of prices hitting $40 or even $50 a barrel over the next few months is alarmist, and that any efforts by Opec to hurt the west would be self-defeating, triggering a recession that would lead to another collapse in oil prices. </p> <p>The Saudis are warning their fellow cartel members that higher prices only encourage non-Opec members to explore for new reserves which reduce prices, and Opec's market share. Should the more militant members of Opec try to force Saudi Arabia into adopting a more aggressive stance, there would be a real prospect of the cartel breaking up. </p> <p>On the other hand, there seems little prospect that prices will ease back towards the $25 a barrel benchmark favoured by Riyadh even if Saudi Arabia - the only Opec member with significant spare capacity - achieves a small production increase. The emergence of big non-Opec oil producers such as Russia and Norway does not alter the demand-supply position because Norway has no spare capacity and the Russians are incapable of pumping any extra oil because of the ramshackle state of their industry. </p> <p>The concern in the west is that Opec could do in 2000 what it did in 1973 and trigger a big recession in the industrialised world. Already, it has helped push inflation in the 11 countries of the euro zone above its ceiling of 2% and prompted the European Central Bank to raise interest rates, a move that might take the momentum out of Europe's recovery. </p> <p>French fishermen have already shown what they think of the rising price of diesel by blockading Channel ports in protest, with the queues of boats as potent an image of the impact of rising prices as the footage of motorists queueing at the pumps in the 70s. </p> <p>The world has changed since 1973 and the west is much less dependent on oil than it was a quarter of a century ago. There are some economists who believe that higher oil prices are just what the doctor ordered, because they will provide the sort of check on the booming US economy that has not been forthcoming from Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve. But as the price creeps up, nerves in Frankfurt, Tokyo and Washington have started to jangle. For some policymakers, it all seems worryingly familiar.</p>",

  "At least the members of the Scottish parliament got the important legislation out of the way early. Last year, on the historic first day of sitting, the newly elected members of the newly devolved institution agreed on the following: that they should all receive a bronze commemorative medal to mark their role in history. Exhausted by the legislative process, they then took a two-month holiday. Though not before deciding it would be a fine idea to commission a \u00a3200m building in which to conduct their future activities. <p> Tomorrow, when they start their second year in business, the members of the Scottish parliament will have a somewhat more rigorous agenda. Over the summer, the political news has made alarming reading for them. Take these headlines from the Daily Record, Scotland's biggest-selling daily paper, last Wednesday: \"Beleaguered ministers careers take turn for the worse exam chaos spreads waiting lists soar union chiefs threaten autumn of discontent\".</p> <p> Meanwhile, Alex Salmond , the leader of the SNP, the official opposition party, has been spending the summer telling everyone who will listen that, technically, the Scottish economy is about to enter recession: receipts are below expenditure, imports above exports, with economic growth too low to mop up the difference. As birthday messages to mark the second year of devolved government go, the Scottish parliament could hardly have chosen a less complimentary one: much of the superficial evidence suggests this is a country which cannot rule itself.</p> <p> In truth, walking round the streets last week, Scotland does not look on the verge of economic collapse. Edinburgh in particular, with its endless new bars and restaurants and a housing market approaching London levels of ludicrousness, looks in rude economic health. In Glasgow, too, the buoyant central business district is full of busy corporations such as Scottish Power, Scottish Widows and Scottish Gas, whose nomenclature identifies them firmly with the sort of self-confident nationalism which would be reckoned business suicide south of the border. And, since everyone living outside the central belt is always quick to point out that Glasgow and Edinburgh are not the real Scotland, it seems advisable to report that business-wise things are pretty cheery elsewhere too.</p> <p> \"Shell has just announced a big increase in investment up here,\" says Amanda Harvie, of the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce. \"Without wishing to suggest we are approaching boom times, I'd say there was overall an upturn in confidence at the sharp end. That is not to pretend there are not real challenges ahead.\"</p> <p> As its defenders would point out, it is the challenges that the Scottish parliament has been set up to address. Success can get on by its own, it is failure that needs sorting out by government. And - impending recession or not - Scotland has enormous challenges beyond an apparent inability to mark examination papers properly. Bad health, bad housing, bad diet and drug abuse are endemic. It is a nation, too, identified by division: north/south east/west Lowland/Highland rural/urban. Many of the divisions are even enshrined constitutionally: this is a country which still legislates to ensure Catholics and Protestants are educated separately.</p> <p> And it doesn't seem as if its globally expansive corporations are keen to help. As Stagecoach, Scottish Media and Scottish Power colonise the corporate world with a voracity to match their empire building forebears, they seem to have all but forgotten the local community from which they draw their wealth and expertise. In the past, Scottish business success was characterised by huge public projects (Andrew Carnegie was the typical Scottish philanthropist). Now success is marked by the size of directors' remuneration. Tellingly, the lottery-funded Museum of Scotland which has just opened to great acclaim in Edinburgh, is the only grand cultural building to be built in this grandest cultural city in the last century. Unless you count Murrayfield.</p> <p> Still, in case it may have forgotten the many challenges it faces, the Scottish parliament can always rely on its media to remind it. In an over-crowded newspaper market, Scottish papers seem to have decided that bad news sells. For his own political reasons, Andrew Neil has ensured his Scotsman keeps its teeth never far from the jugular. Even the traditionally Labour-supporting Daily Record has administered almost daily assaults on Donald Dewar and his team since the moment they took office. The failures of the examination system or fears of impending recession are given far greater prominence than the revelation that 29 new schools are being built in Glasgow alone. And always - with every piece of bad news - the new parliament is held accountable.</p> <p> \"There is a real schizophrenia in this country,\" says Frank McAveety MSP, the deputy minister for local government. \"The Scottish press corps lobbied harder than anyone for a devolved parliament, now they've got it, they're queuing up to give it a good kicking.\"</p> <p> For many observers of the Scottish scene - Billy Connolly for instance - there is nothing new in this symptom of a split national personality. In the new Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow's Exchange Square, it is there for all to see. Housed in a glorious legacy from the city's mercantile past, the gallery is full, not of the art of a self-confident, newly semi-independent country, but of gloom and pessimism. Albeit producing fascinating, visually arresting work, young Scottish artists seem obsessed with national shortcomings, failure and self-loathing. In their view everything appears to be wrong with Scotland, from its housing to its way with sex. The misanthropic whole is summed up by Ron O'Donnell's brilliant painting featuring a man bedecked in tartan, sitting in a room decorated with the memorabilia of plastic patriotism. He is slumped in an armchair, can in hand, watching the big match on television. Instead of a head he has a football. The painting is called The Scotsman.</p> <p> \"I think that painting's got it right: football really is an important metaphor for Scottish life, not least because we are so obsessed with it,\" says Sandy Ross, managing director of Scottish Television. \"For instance, you can't ignore the effect the 1978 World Cup had on the collective psyche. We went there saying we could beat the world and we were humiliated as only we Scots can be. I reckon Andrew Marr was right when he said this sense of 'we're crap and we know we are' which resulted from that campaign completely destroyed any chance of devolution the last time it was on the cards in 1979. We simply thought we weren't up to it.\"</p> <p> And if it isn't football, it's Thatcher. The 80s were a bleak time for Scotland, battered by recession, steam-rollered by brutalist economic theories, then spat on as the laboratory of the poll tax. For many in Scotland, it was easy to point the finger for failings. Though to be fair, it is not just paranoia: the English really do appear to have little concern for what goes on over the garden wall.</p> <p> \"Since I came to Scotland 10 years ago,\" says Gavin Stamp, senior lecturer at the McIntosh School of Architecture in Glasgow, \"I've become much more aware of English indifference to Scotland. I have friends who proudly tell me they have never visited Scotland in a way they would be ashamed to admit if they had never been to Paris.\"</p> <p> However justified, loathing of English control over a land for which there was minimal interest became endemic the manner in which the Scottish Office doled out the money in an unaccountable fashion from Westminster was identified as the root cause of every evil visited on the country.</p> <p> \"The country became irresponsible, plagued by a moaning, defeatist culture,\" says Andrew Jaspan, editor of the Herald on Sunday newspaper. \"Every problem was blamed on London.\"</p> <p> Blame: an important word in the Scottish vocabulary.</p> <p> \"Oh yes, we're always looking for someone to blame,\" says Sandy Ross. \"The New Labour honeymoon was far shorter up here. We were already suspicious that Blair would desert us long before he was even elected.\"</p> <p> For the Scottish politicians who arrived after devolution in 1999, getting to grips with blame is part of the new job description.</p> <p> \"The Thatcher years distorted politics in Scotland,\" says Frank McAveety. \"It made it easy. We could all agree we hated her and she was to blame for everything. Now that's all over, there is a much more difficult job: deciding what we stand for and whether we can do it.\"</p> <p> Not that there is a general faith abroad that the parliament is the body to sort much out at all. It is hard to find anyone - unless they are employed by Holyrood - who has a kind word to say about the new Scottish political institutions. If there is any feeling at all for the parliament on the streets, it is the one neatly summarised by Billy Connolly who calls it a \"wee pretendy parliament\". Yet for some observers, the very fact Scotland at last has a parliament to sneer at is a major step forward.</p> <p> \"We may have a mess now with all this summer's cock-ups,\" says Andrew Jaspan, \"but at least it's Scotland's mess. For years it's been easy to say it's someone else's fault. Now people have to face up to it. And I think that's brilliant.\"</p> <p> Jaspan points to the debate about Section 28 as a perfect example of what he calls a \"growing-up process\" instigated by the arrival of the parliament. The debate was an ugly, divisive one. The bus billionaire Brian Souter bankrolled a campaign against its abolition which quickly ran out of control. Posters suggested that if Section 28 was removed from the statute books, buggery would become part of the syllabus. With the willing endorsement of the Catholic church and parts of the Church of Scotland, the anti-abolitionists whipped up a virulently homophobic fervour.</p> <p> \"A lot of people said that the debate over Section 28 was a disaster,\" says Jaspan, \"but I reckon it was probably the best debate Scotland's had for years. It challenged a lot of people who assumed we were a tolerant, liberal society to really look at themselves and defend the issues.\"</p> <p> Gordon Macdougall, the political editor of Scottish Television, agrees.</p> <p> \"A lot of my English friends told me that the Section 28 business showed what a backward, ugly nation we really were,\" he says. \"But at the end of it, Section 28 has been abolished up here and it is still on the statute books down south.\"</p> <p> For all its symbolic importance, however, Section 28 was still, in essence, an intellectual issue. When it comes to the nitty-gritty of finance, health, housing and education, the parliament does not yet appear to have proved that it can run things better than Westminster.</p> <p> \"A year is too soon to tell,\" says Frank McAveety. \"But I believe we are putting in place legislation which, in the long run, will change Scotland for the better. I think people had such high hopes of immediate change, there is inevitably a sense of anti-climax, but legislation takes time. I'm relaxed about the slagging off. It is a legitimate job of the press to examine. And you could say it's that good for the first time they really have something to examine.\"</p> <p> It would help, some observers feel, if the parliament could get its own PR right. Not just stopping blunders such as its self-important first day in office, but being much more active in explaining to voters just what it is up to. But in the meantime, for the first time in Scotland's parliamentary history, the boys and girls returning to Holyrood for the new term tomorrow have to face up to this issue: a summer of relentless bad news has got to be resolved not at 400 miles distance, but by them, on their fellow citizens' doorstep.</p> <p> \"It is the big question: can the Scots govern themselves? and we shall have to wait for the answer,\" says Gavin Stamp. \"Mind you, population of less than five million, edge of Europe, crap climate: the Norwegians seem to manage it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Whatever your experience as a student, there will be times when things go wrong. Sometimes these are just minor problems and sort themselves out. But sometimes you may want to complain about your experience. If you do, this is when the world of student experience collides with the world of university administration. And it is not a pretty sight.</p> <p> Postgraduate research students often have particularly bad experiences due to the nature of their supervisory relationships, inherent isolation and the length of their study. Often postgraduates feel disempowered in the academic community and reliant on not rocking the boat, since they feel this may threaten the successful completion of their research. But it is much more damaging to keep quiet and let problems compound over time. If you do complain, then the situation is anything but clear. </p> <p> Complaints procedures in universities are in a mess. There are two aspects here: internal and external procedures. Internal mechanisms for dealing with complaints are being improved now. The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAAHE) launched a Code of Practice for dealing with internal complaints in May this year (available at <a href=\"http://www.qaa.ac.uk/\"> http://www.qaa.ac. uk/</a>). But external mechanisms are often archaic, confusing and unfair. </p> <p> If you ask what the system is for external complaints, there are two answers. Older universities set up under royal charter are bound by decisions of the visitor, an external and arguably independent person whose authority on dispute resolution is upheld by the courts. New universities are subject to judicial review separately through the courts. Why two systems? Historical accident and a certain arrogance by some universities that the system was working and didn't need changing. It wasn't and it does. </p> <p> If your university is governed by the visitorial system, who are these \"visitors\"? They include the Queen and various other royals, the archbishops of Canterbury and York and a selection of lords and earls. But don't expect a visit from the Queen if you want to complain about your supervision. These cases will be dealt with by the Privy Council Office or the Lord Chancellor's Department in Whitehall. Visitors very rarely visit a university and have been known to pass judgment on cases simply by writing to students and telling them that their case has been rejected with no explanation. </p> <p>Don't expect the system to be fast, either. Some cases last years without resolution. It is not surprising that students who have been forced to deal with some university complaints procedures have strong views such as: \"Though universities don't have universal grievance procedures, they do seem to have a cynically consistent protocol for stitching up 'strident' students.\" In a National Postgraduate Committee survey on student complaints in 1998, when institutions were asked if they had a complaints procedure, 34% said no. When asked why, one university responded that it didn't need a complaints procedure because it never received any complaints. </p> <p> So surely the solution is for universities to change their procedures? But only the government can alter the visitorial system, through legislation. Unfortunately there was no will to do this until May this year, when higher education minister Baroness Blackstone acknowledged that \"it is time for a modern, open, transparent system\". This was surprising since, in the same month, the Department for Education and Employment was saying that the government had no plans for change. </p> <p>So why the change of heart? This probably has something to do with the forthcoming Human Rights Act, which comes into force on October 2. Universities and the government have a certain incentive now to reform the system to avoid unnecessary expense, if not severe embarrassment. So how should student complaints be managed? The Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals has proposed various alternatives in recent years from arbitration to independent review panels.</p> <p> However, opinion now seems to be swinging firmly in favour of a single system for all UK universities in the form of a national ombudsman. Coincidentally, the NPC and the National Union of Students have been calling for such a solution for years. Owain James, NUS president, says: \"Students are now consumers. In no other sector would you pay for a service and not expect to have the option of complaining if the quality was not up to scratch.\" New legislation to establish an ombudsman for higher education would be a positive move to eradicate the archaic and anachronistic practices infesting the sector. Universities must face up to their responsibilities to students and deal with complaints effectively and fairly. </p> <p> Even if change was agreed this would not protect students immediately. But there are some things you can do to avoid ever having to deal with complaints mechanisms. The best solution is to deal with problems as soon as they arise at as low a level as possible. Be honest with yourself and with staff such as your supervisor. If you are having problems with your supervisor, speak to the head of department, someone in the postgraduate office or at the students' union. Be sure to keep records of your meetings with staff and supervisors, what was agreed, and write out regular progress updates for yourself. If things do go wrong this will provide strong evidence to support your complaint.</p> <p> Whatever you do, don't hide from the problems. They won't go away and might get much worse. If you deal with things quickly you can move on positively. There is finally light at the end of the tunnel and signs of radical reform to sweep away the ancient and inept procedures that universities have clung to for so long. More important than the procedures themselves is the need for a significant shift in attitudes. Universities and their staff should welcome and encourage comments at all levels and bring an open and non-judgmental attitude to complaints. </p> <p>Adopting a defensive and overly formal stance from the outset causes frustration and animosity and encourages confrontation. Complaints are something to learn from to improve services and practices. And that is something we can all hope for, whether students, staff or administrators.

  "<p>One day soon, universities may find themselves being forced to submit to inspections by the school standards watchdog, Ofsted. Its controversial chief, Chris Woodhead, is carefully preparing the ground, both privately and publicly, and this week Ofsted told the Guardian: \"We are not aware of a national demand for Ofsted to inspect universities - yet. But, if asked, we would consider the proposal sympathetically.\" </p> <p>Ofsted also said it has a foothold in universities. It inspects parts of university teacher training courses, and Woodhead's contempt for many of those who run them has been freely expressed. Woodhead has already run successful campaigns to widen Ofsted's empire. Three years ago he took over inspecting further education colleges. Then, more recently, the formation of the Adult Learning Inspectorate was overshadowed by the announcement that it would have to play second fiddle to Ofsted in any institutions where anyone aged between 16 and 18 were taught - which is most of them. </p> <p>That's why the appointment earlier this month of David Sherlock as the Adult Learning Inspectorate boss attracted little attention. It hardly matters, and higher education minister Baroness Blackstone rubbed it in when she announced it. \"It is essential that we secure as rigorous an inspection regime for adult education as Ofsted provides for schools\" she said, deadpan. </p> <p>Inspection of universities is currently split between two bodies: the Quality Assurance Agency, which inspects courses, and the year-old Institute for Learning and Teaching, which accredits individual teachers. The agency is furiously and regularly attacked by vice-chancellors, and the institute is suffering from serious neglect because few top academics have taken any interest in it. </p> <p>\"The institute desperately needs public support, not just from the new universities, but from the prestige institutions as well,\" says Paul Cottrell, deputy general secretary of the Association of University Teachers. </p> <p>\"Either the higher education community puts its back into the institute and makes it work, or we have to live with whatever the government imposes on us as an alternative. </p> <p>\"There are disturbing signs that that could be Ofsted and Mr Woodhead. Universities will then find that they have jumped out of their own frying pan into someone else's fire.\" </p> <p>Woodhead's carefully publicised attack on universities last week - \"vacuous courses\", \"this kind of failure is unjustifiable,\" \"Can confidence be restored in the university as a centre for liberal education?\" - was not, as most people imagined, a typically arrogant piece of posing about a subject on which he has no standing. Nor was it made because - as he disingenuously suggested - the products of the schools, for which he is responsible, often end up in universities, so he has a duty to comment on universities. On that basis it would be just as appropriate for him to lay the law down about prisons. </p> <p>The real subtext is clear. Woodhead was saying in a coded way that the institute and the agency have failed. So send in Ofsted, armed with draconian powers. </p> <p>Is that what the universities want? From their behaviour, you would have thought so, but it is more likely that until now, the strategy has been so subtle that university chiefs have failed to notice Woodhead smiling in the shadows. If they had, they might have tempered their scorn for the agency, whose boss, John Randall, is considered by many of the more ivy-covered vice-chancellors to be the devil incarnate. </p> <p>The Warden of New College Oxford, philosopher Alan Ryan, spoke for many colleagues in the prestige universities when he said: \"If vice-chancellors had any gumption, the agency would be closed tomorrow.\" </p> <p>When approving a course, he complains, the agency \"insists on truckloads of supporting bumph, and sends out inspecting teams whose members would not make the shortlist for a job at the very institutions they inspect.\" </p> <p>The heads of Cambridge University, University College London and other prestige institutions have regularly kicked the agency around with no less glee than Ryan. </p> <p>On the Institute for Learning and Teaching, their silence has been deafening. The institute is entirely voluntary. No university teacher is forced to get a teaching qualification, and only about 2,000 of Britain's estimated 150,000 eligible staff have done so. If it were made clear that the universities valued a teaching qualification, and were more likely to appoint or to promote people who had it, this might change. But the public support for its work from the top of the academic profession has not been there, and in private they are often scathing about it. </p> <p>Their discontent with the various assessment procedures was so freely and fruitily expressed that the Higher Education Funding Council commissioned a report, released last week, which found that the procedures were too expensive, the regime was inefficient, and there was too much bureaucracy. </p> <p>School heads, weary from the endless form-filling and denigration they get from Ofsted, might be inclined to tell universities: \"Always keep ahold of nurse, For fear of finding something worse.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's been said that taking drugs to fight depression has the opposite effect to drinking alcohol. With alcohol you get the good bits first and the hangover later. With antidepressants you get the unpleasant side effects first and it can take up to six weeks to feel the benefits. It's no wonder that many people get fed up and stop taking them, leaving depression as not only one of the most common medical problems around, but one of the most under treated. </p> <p>So it's handy that a paper in last week's British Medical Journal suggests that there may be an alternative pill for treating depression. Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort), a herb used in ancient Greece to cure demonic possession, may be as effective as routine antidepressants in relieving depression. In a German study of 324 patients with mild to moderate depression, those who took St John's wort for six weeks reported nearly half as many side effects as those on routine antidepressants and only 3% stopped taking the herb. About 16% of those taking antidepressants stopped because of side effects. </p> <p>\"We've known for a while that St John's wort works for depression,\" says Patricia White, spokeswoman for the Depression Alliance. \"In Germany it has been prescribed for 20 to 30 years. Patients don't seem to be told about it in the UK, which is a shame because some people may feel it's more acceptable to take a herbal remedy before trying antidepressants.\" </p> <p>National surveys show that people are reluctant to take medication for depression, according to Dr Paul Bebbington, professor of social and community psychiatry at University College, London. \"People often think they should be able to deal with it without taking tablets - that they should just pull their socks up. When you are depressed you have a low tolerance for side effects anyway. People particularly dislike having a dry mouth and feeling woozy.\" Other common side effects include blurred vision, headaches, constipation and nausea. \"But some symptoms that people attribute to the antidepressants, like tiredness, are actually due to the depression,\" says Bebbington. Stephen Harrison, a 42-year-old teacher, now retired on medical grounds, has been taking St John's wort for depression for two years, after being on antidepressants for six years. It took him over a decade to be diagnosed and given any treatment at all. \"I probably had my first major depressive episode in my early 20s,\" he says. \"It seems pretty obvious that was what it was now but then my doctor called it burn out. I was on a graduate trainee banking scheme and I just felt this unhappiness creep over me. I went to bed for a week - I couldn't face getting up.\" </p> <p>He left banking and became a teacher, moved to Gloucestershire and got married. He was well until his 30s when the symptoms of depression started creeping back. \"They were classic symptoms - although I didn't realise - I didn't want to get up in the mornings, I was sad and tearful, in my worst moments I felt suicidal. I went off my food, I lost weight. But I was still in denial about my depression.\" His new GP was direct with him. \"He immediately said, 'Come on, this is depression,'\" says Harrison, \"My reaction was relief that someone had put a name to it.\" </p> <p>Prozac didn't help but other antidepressants did. \"I wouldn't run them down but I reached the stage where I didn't want to fill up my system with these drugs. They made me feel drowsy and I got a little confused at times. My short-term memory seemed to go a bit. I heard about St John's wort and knew people who were taking it so I thought I would give it a try. I didn't tell my GP until afterwards and he said, 'Fine if it works for you.' I got the right dose by trial and error, taking different brands and different strengths. I don't get any side effects with it. I get the odd day when I feel a bit depressed again but that's all it is. I have found it to be incredibly effective for me.\" With his depression under control Harrison feels obliged to be open with people about his ill ness. \"Everyone who knows me knows what I have suffered from. There is still a stigma around depression, especially for men. It's unfortunate we use the word depression to cover such a range of feeling. We say a film is depressing but it's not in the true sense of the word.\" </p> <p>The Depression Alliance estimates that one in four people will suffer from depression sufficiently badly to benefit from taking antidepressants of some sort. Many don't even see their doctors. \"Depression can be a relapsing condition and it is bad news to suffer from it without treatment, says Bebbington. The causes are not clear; genetics and circumstances both play a part: \"It's probably due to a range of factors. I tend to think a lot of it is down to adversity and social circumstances.\" </p> <p>\"We find lots of people with depression have had an adverse life event, such as bereavement or redundancy,\" says Patricia White. Why these things work on the brain to reduce levels of serotonin [a neurotransmitter - a chemical messenger between nerve cells] in the brain is unknown. But antidepressants work for over 75% of people. They generally block off receptors in the brain so that people with depression can reuptake serotonin at the same speed as everyone else. It's a biochemical disorder. Some people don't like the idea of taking drugs that interfere with chemicals in the brain.\" </p> <p>It's not clear how St John's wort works - it has at least 10 compounds that may contribute to its pharmacological effects such as flavinoids and xanthones. Its side effects, such as confusion and stomach upsets are generally mild, although it can react dangerously with other drugs such as warfarin (a blood thinning drug) and tetracycline (an antibiotic). Despite its pharmacological activity it is sold as a food supplement and not registered as a drug in the UK - so preparations are not standardised or available on the NHS. \"In Germany it is registered drug with standardised preparations,\" says Edward Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at the university of Exeter. \"In the UK the amount of St John's wort in a preparation can vary from 100% to zero. Doctors know very little about how to use it and what doses are needed.\" </p> <p>If the Medicines Control Agency was to consider registering St John's wort as a medicine, the herb may never make it. \"It is difficult to register any herbal drug,\" says Ernst. \"There are toxicology problems; each herb has many compounds, not a single clean one. How can you know which compound you have to supply toxicity data for? A third category may be needed that falls between registered medicines and food supplements.\" </p> <p>Even without registered medicine status, doctors may feel it's appropriate to suggest St John's wort as a first line drug for mild and moderate depression. \"But you would have to treat it like a new drug and be rather careful, especially as it is not subject to the normal surveillance system for drug side effects,\" says Bebbington. \"There are side effects that only emerge when the drug is used in clinical practice as opposed to trials.\" </p> <p>\"We think the most important thing is that people have an informed choice about which medication they take,\" says White. \"We would also suggest they have a talking therapy as well such as psychotherapy or counselling. Antidepressants lift your mood but they don't cure depression. It's important that people develop their support networks.

  "<p>Pity the poor parent now facing the prospect of having their child vaccinated against meningitis C. Last autumn, when the new, life-saving jab was launched against a disease that held only terror for anybody with a family, it all seemed so simple. People were camping out in their GP's waiting room, determined to get their child protected. They wrote furious letters to the authorities, demanding to know why only babies and teenagers could be vaccinated. They were outraged by talk of vaccine shortages. </p> <p>But that was a few short seasons ago. Since then, a slow and soggy summer - in terms of news stories - has turned all that hope and conviction into a quagmire of uncertainty. First the Express and then the Observer have alleged the meningitis C vaccine is not as safe as the experts insist. The Observer said 11 deaths had been linked to the jab, and there had been a cover-up. </p> <p>The chief medical officer went into an apoplectic spin, and with some justification. These stories were based on data from the yellow card system - not the smartest way of recording side-effects from medical treatment, but the only one the UK has. Doctors are asked to send in a yellow card to the Medicines Control Agency if any of their patients has an unexpected reaction while on a drug or medication. So when a patient dies suddenly and they have recently been vaccinated against meningitis C, some GPs will feel moved to send in a yellow card. </p> <p>What the MCA is collecting is raw data. It needs investigation. Each of the 12 (not 11) deaths reported on yellow cards in which vaccination was mentioned has been investigated. And, say the committee on safety of medicines and the joint committee on vaccinations and immunisation, who issued a high-level rebuttal, none of the deaths were due to the jab. So why did these 12 people die? Seven were babies who died of sudden infant death syndrome - cot death - which peaks in the age group being given the vaccination. Two died of meningitis B - time and again public health officials have warned that the C vaccine does not protect against the B strain. One had pneumococcal septicaemia, one died of bronchiolitis and one from pneumonia. </p> <p>It's pretty hard to support the hypothesis that the meningitis C vaccination caused all these deaths once you know the facts - although the conspiracy theorists who abound in the anti-vaccination lobby would no doubt still try. But if newspapers can get it wrong, how are people with much less access to those in the know supposed to get it right? </p> <p>The fact is that vaccinations are scary. The big hard truth about them is that each one of us, in taking our child along, is being asked to do the sort of risk assessment that for decades we were not thought grown-up enough to tackle. Doctors used to do it for us and lay down the law - vaccination saves lives, even if some people suffer side-effects from it, and therefore you will be vaccinated. That is not on any more. </p> <p>But we are in transition. Because doctors used to refuse to admit there were risks, we still do not believe them when they tell us there are risks, but they are tiny in comparison to the horror of children's deaths. To complicate matters further, we are asked not to consider the risk to our own child - but the safety of the entire vulnerable population. Vaccination only keeps disease at bay if the whole herd is immunised. Public health officials fear a measles outbreak is imminent because of parents' reluctance to take children for the MMR jab, born of what they claim are groundless fears. </p> <p>If we are to be able to make a cool, calm, rational judgement about any vaccination, we need absolute openness. All the facts have to be on the table. The MCA has always been the most secretive of government agencies, suspected of being hand in glove with drug companies. That has to change. The meningitis C vaccine has already cut meninigitis cases by 85% among those vaccinated - seven in the last three months instead of 45 last year. But for such vaccinations to continue to save lives we need to be able to trust the people who tell us we have nothing to fear.</p> <p>\u0095 Sarah Boseley is the Guardian's health correspondent.

  "<p>The sponsorship opportunities being bandied around at this year's Olympics make Anthea and Grant's recent efforts look like child's play. From Coca-Cola to Kodak, Time to Telstra, everyone seems to want a piece of the sporting action.</p> <p>The main sponsors of the event - the so-called \"TOP\", or The Olympic Partnership sponsors - are estimated to have paid upwards of $40 million. For that the sponsors, which include McDonald's, Coca-Cola, IBM and Visa, get the global exclusive on advertising Olympic tie-ins for their sector, and the right to a physical presence at the Games.</p> <p>Of course, it does not include the cost of the actual advertising to be done throughout the world on television, print, posters and the web, which will doubtless run to many, many more millions.</p> <p>So is it worth it? McDonald's seems to think so. It has just signed up for the 2002 Salt Lake Ciy Olympics and the 2004 Athens Summer Games at a reported cost of $55 million.</p> <p>But IBM has dropped out of TOP, and the organisers of the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics are said to be having trouble finding sponsors because of the bribery scandal surrounding the selection of Salt Lake City for the 2000 Games.</p> <p>The other problem is that not everyone is prepared to pay for the benefit of association with the Games. This year the International Olympic Committee has tried to regain some control over advertising relating to the Games after a Nike campaign that ran during the 1996 Olympics. The campaign, which featured lines such as, \"You don't win silver; you lose gold,\" was criticised as being antithetical to the spirit of the games.</p> <p>The criticism gave rise to the term \"ambush marketing\", a practice the IOC is keen to stamp out. The committee drew up a code of practice for advertisers. But recent campaigns from Qantas and the National Australia Bank, another non-sponsor that has run ads linking itself to the Olympics, have proved the code to be pretty ineffectual.</p>",

  "William Hague today promised to set Britain free from big government, big bureaucracy and Brussels, as he launched the Conservative Party's pre-manifesto document in a desperate attempt to erode Labour's comfortable lead in the polls. <p>In sketching the outlines of Believing in Britain, Mr Hague said that the Tories' new social agenda was based on \"one very simple, very Conservative principle: Freedom.\"</p> <p>Mr Hague's speech rehashed tenets held dear by Conservatives, minimum government, low taxes and cutting regulation.</p> <p>But the Tory leader may have promised more than he can deliver when he said that the Tories will reduce \"the burden of tax and spend more on public services.\"</p> <p>On Europe, he pledged to stop Britain drifting into a European \"superstate.\"</p> <p>The pre-manifesto document included a promise to enshrine in legislation the ring fencing of powers in certain policy areas, such as taxation and defence, which could not be ceded to Europe. </p> <p>Today's document, which will form the basis of the party's election manifesto proper, also promised a range of new rights for parents in the schooling of their children, as well as a radical revamp of higher education.</p> <p>It set out Mr Hague's ambition to establish Britain as a world-class centre for the new economy. </p> <p>Introducing the document, Mr Hague sought to paint his party's policies toward Europe as a defence of Britain's national identity. </p> <p>\"Extraordinarily, the Conservatives will be the only major party fighting the next election determined to stop the surrender of our most precious right as a country - the right to govern ourselves,\" said Mr Hague. </p> <p>The pre-manifesto document said that a Tory government would amend domestic law to include \"reserved powers\" - preventing European Union law from overriding the will of parliament in areas where it did not voluntarily transfer powers to the EU. </p> <p>A Conservative administration would also seek to ensure that any future government which wished to surrender any of Parliament's rights and powers to Brussels would first have to secure the electorate's approval in a referendum.</p> <p>The document warned: \"Conservatives strongly support the enlargement of the EU and regard it as a high priority.</p> <p>\"With the prospect of such enlargement, the EU has reached a fork in the road. Down one route lies a fully integrated superstate, with nation states and the national veto disappearing.</p> <p>\"This is the route down which Britain is gradually drifting.

  "Peace campaigners will finally leave Greenham Common this week after exactly 19 years of continuous presence at the site. <p>But they are already laying down plans for a memorial to commemorate their battle against the nuclear weapons which were once based there. </p> <p>The missiles finally left the Berkshire common in 1991, though many protesters stayed on until the perimeter fences of the old base were taken down earlier this year. </p> <p>Today the last caravan belonging to the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp will leave for good, 19 years to the day after the protesters arrived. </p> <p>Some of the buildings have been let to businesses and the control tower, which once followed the movements of missile-laden aircraft, has been earmarked for a visitor centre. </p> <p>The rest of the site has been returned to common land and the camp's Commemorative Fund Appeal Collective is busy co-ordinating plans for a memorial area, which will include a ring of Welsh stones, sculptures and a special garden. </p> <p>Fund spokeswoman Sarah Hipperson said: \"I'm glad we can leave on a positive note and I feel this next stage is also historically important. </p> <p>\"We need to leave something there that will be a reminder to all peace-loving people. The name Greenham Common is synonymous with the resistance against nuclear weapons.\" </p> <p>Greenham Common was requisitioned for use as an air base in 1941 and from 1968 onwards was occupied by the US Air Force. The site gained notoriety in 1980 when the Americans were allowed to store 96 cruise missiles there - a decision which caused such concern to a group of women from Wales that they travelled to the site and chained themselves to the fence. </p> <p>After the missiles were removed, the women stayed to ensure the land was handed back to the people. It was finally sold to the Greenham Common Trust in 1997 and much of the land was then passed back to the local council for just \u00a31.</p> <p>The Peace Camp women will mark their departure today with a day-long picnic.

  "William Hague will today prompt new accusations that he is embarking on a Thatch-erite tilt to the right when he outlines Tory plans to end state funding of universities. <p>Speaking at the launch of the Tories' pre-election manifesto, Mr Hague will declare that a Tory government would fund universities by handing over billions of pounds raised in government auctions. </p> <p>The money, similar to the \u00a320bn raised in the recent mobile phone licence auction, would be used to set up a series of endowment funds for individual universities across Britain. The universities would not be allowed to touch the capital, but they would be allowed to use the interest \"to make whatever financial arrangements they like\". </p> <p>The money would replace the hundreds of millions of pounds provided by the state each year through the higher education funding council. A typical university, with a total income of \u00a3200m a year, receives about \u00a350m from the council. </p> <p>Mr Hague believes that his proposal, entitled Recovering Excellence, would give British universities the financial freedom to restore their reputation as the finest higher educational institutions in the world. His proposals would allow universities to set their own pay rates \"to attract the world's best academics and researchers\" - but they would not be allowed to set their own rate for tuition fees. </p> <p>The Tories hope to put each university in Britain on the sort of financial footing enjoyed by Oxford and Cambridge colleges which benefit from huge endowments. Apart from endowments and state money, universities raise the rest of their funding through tuition fees for overseas and British students, research projects and private sector links. </p> <p>The proposal - in the man-ifesto, entitled Believing in Britain - says: \"Britain's best universities used to be the best in the world. Our most advanced educational institutions must recover their excellence.\" </p> <p>However, Mr Hague's proposal is likely to provoke claims that the Tories want to create a two-tier university system. Under his plans, universities would have to apply for an endowment which would mean that top tier institutions, such as Oxford and Cambridge, would stand a good chance of securing the first endowments. </p> <p>A Tory spokesman denied the proposals would create a new tier of elite universities. \"We would be very careful to make sure that there is a broad cross section of universities in the first wave,\" he said. \"We would want to have universities with a strong arts background along with science- based institutions.\" </p> <p>Mr Hague's controversial proposal is designed to take the election battle directly onto Labour territory. Private polling by the two parties consistently show that the government enjoys a strong lead over the Tories in education after the prime minister's pledge to place \"education education education\" at the top of his agenda. </p> <p>Mr Hague hopes that his plan will indicate that the Tories are determined to inject serious money into education, but in a way which will show the Thatcherite torch is still burning. The Tory document says that the eventual sell-off of today's television airwaves - when digital television cov ers the whole country - could raise up to \u00a350bn for the university endowments scheme. </p> <p>\"Endowments are a sensible, prudent use of future one-off capital receipts, such as future radio spectrum auctions, analogue TV switch-off and privatisations,\" the document says. \"They represent better value for money than simply putting those receipts into paying off government debt because, invested in universities, they would generate a better return than the rate of interest on government debt.\" </p> <p>Educationists are likely to express fears that leaving university funding to the vagaries of the market could provide an unstable base for institutions to plan their future.</p>",
  "<p>It's one of the Queen's less glamorous jobs, shared with the Queen Mother, the Duke of Edinburgh, several bishops, a couple of hereditary peers, the Master of the Rolls and Mary Archer. As university Visitors, they are ultimately responsible for arbitrating students' appeals and complaints. But not, it seems, for much longer.</p> <p>If the idea of a student dissatisfied with his or her degree result petitioning Her Majesty had a certain quaint charm, in practice the system had led to growing criticism and scandalous delays. Talks about reform got nowhere for years - universities were not keen to make it easier for students to complain. Now, however, David Blunkett, the education secretary, has been warned that the whole archaic series of arrangements is about to collapse as the European Convention on Human Rights is incorporated into English law next month. </p> <p>Baroness Blackstone, the education minister, has signalled clearly that she would like to see an ombudsman as part of a reform of the way student complaints are dealt with, and has asked the higher education sector to come up with proposals by the end of the year. Next week the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals is to discuss the issue. It appears to be moving towards the idea of an ombudsman - something the NUS has been pressing for for some time. </p> <p>But the government may not have that long before the system breaks down. From October 2 any student challenging a university's Visitor in the courts would be \"almost certain to succeed\", says Dennis Farrington, a leading legal expert in the field, in a report to the Department for Education and Employment. </p> <p>He urges the government and the universities to establish an ombudsman to determine appeals, believing it to be the fairest system for both the students and the institutions and the best way of complying with theHuman Rights Act which brings the European Convention into play. </p> <p>Confusion and uncertainty surround the Visitor system in the minds of the Visitors themselves, let alone students, according to Farrington, an education consultant to Lawfords solicitors. (At one unnamed Oxbridge college, the rules setting out the procedure are in Latin.) </p> <p>Not all universities have Visitors - students at the former polytechnics have to go to court if they cannot get satisfaction from their university authorities. (Hertfordshire University has, however, appointed Lady Archer as its Visitor, although she is not one in law.) </p> <p>The old universities and Oxbridge colleges (though not, confusingly, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge) have a variety of Visitors, and the Queen acts either through the Lord President of the Privy Council or the Lord Chancellor at different institutions. Some are elected by their governing bodies, which raises the question of whether they are truly independent, while others are hereditary. There are no ethnic minority Visitors. </p> <p>Farrington's survey of universities found wide discrepancies facing students at different universities if they wanted to take their case to the Visitor. Not only does the Queen have two totally different methods of dealing with appeals or complaints, but the bishops and others appeared to be evolving their procedures as they went along. Some, like Sheila Cameron, QC, who acts for the Archbishop of Canterbury, hold oral hearings, though most do not. </p> <p>Underfunding has led to cases dragging on for years. Appeals to the Privy Council were at one point being taken home by a junior civil servant at weekends to be studied, Farrington revealed. The Lord Chancellor's department apologised to Bath postgraduate student Neil McDougall for failing to provide guidance on procedure and timetables. </p> <p>Getting access to the Visitor in the first place is a straightforward process in some places which mention it in the student handbook; but a number of universities said there was no need to tell students about the existence of the Visitorial process because there were no complaints. \"There is some confusion over the legal powers of the Visitor,\" says Farrington, noting that some Visitors appear to be exceeding their common law authority. And although the Privy Council has drafted procedural guidelines in clear modern English, not all the universities concerned knew of them. </p> <p>He adds that the language of the statutes - even when it is in English - is often difficult to follow, and in some of the older colleges actually rule out appeals from students (apart from scholars and exhibitioners when deprived of their awards). Universities in Northern Ireland and Wales appeared to have better information than those in England. </p> <p>Concluding that the Visitorial system was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, Farrington said that unless there was legislation or a government commitment to legislate, a student told to pursue a claim to a Visitor after October 2 would almost certainly succeed in mounting a challenge in the courts: \"I continue to advocate the establishment of a single system to act as the ultimate recourse for students who remain dissatisfied with the institutional response to an appeal or complaint.\" </p> <p>An ombudsman would not be used often if universities had adequate internal procedures and considered alternatives like mediation. </p> <p>Jeremy Hoad, general secretary of the National Postgraduate Committee, is backing the ombudsman proposal to end the \"bizarre, byzantine and archaic\" Visitor system. He urges universities to see complaints as a way of improving teaching and supervision of postgraduates rather than a threat. </p> <p>But there is still considerable support for tradition. Michael Scott-Joynt, the Bishop of Winchester, is Visitor to five Oxford colleges as well as the independent school Winchester College, and is not convinced that a uniform national system is needed, provided that all students have access to speedy and effective remedies. </p> <p>Delays in the Lord Chancellor's department are not a reason for abolishing all Visitors, he says. </p> <p>The bishop has only once been called on to arbitrate a dispute between a don and his college. He appointed a lawyer as \"commissary\" to adjudicate and the matter was resolved. </p> <p>The Oxbridge colleges feel the Visitorial system is quicker and cheaper than the courts or an ombudsman, says Scott-Joynt. The role of the Visitor is not primarily to resolve disputes but to see that the founder's wishes about the character of the institution are maintained, he says. </p> <p>\"Educational institutions might want to see their independent Visitor count in certain circumstances be an important element in any argument about character or independence.\" </p> <p><strong>Cause for complaint</strong></p> <p><strong> Neil McDougall</strong>, a former postgraduate student, has been involved in an eight-year dispute with Bath University, alleging poor supervision, inadequate exam procedures and maladministration. His appeal to the Queen as visitor was handled by the Lord Chancellors' department, which took 19 months to consider his case and earlier this year apologised for \"misplacing\" his file. </p> <p>Six requests for guidance by McDougall were ignored - the department acknowledged its failure to provide guidance on timetables and procedures for presenting his petitions. From May to August 1997 pressure of work for the incoming government meant there was an embargo on visitorial work, and for more than a year only one member of staff was available to deal with cases, and she was \"subject to other ministerial priorities\". </p> <p>McDougall may have received an apology but the Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine concluded that \"administrative weaknesses do not justify further visitorial intervention\" and he regarded the matter as closed. </p> <p><strong> Kevin Wilkinson</strong> moved his wife and two children from Dubai, where he had a well-paid teaching job, to begin a PhD at Aston University in 1997 - only to find his agreed supervisor was not available. After a long and acrimonious dispute he moved to Norwich, where he is studying for his doctorate at the University of East Anglia. Michael Wright, the vice-chancellor, apologised and agreed to refund Wilkinson's fees: \"I agree that your experience was far from satisfactory and that the department of languages should have acted more expeditiously to put satisfactory alternative arrangements in place.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson won legal aid to sue Aston for \u00a3100,000 in damages, and the case continues. The university declined further comment. </p> <p><strong> Francis Foecke</strong>'s dispute with Bristol University has lasted 14 years, since he was accused of cheating in his final exams for computer sciences and maths. He got first-class results in all 13 papers. A committee set up by the university's board of examiners ruled after a two-day hearing that he had cheated in parts of answers to three statistics questions. There were alleged similarities between some of his solutions and model answers prepared by the examiners. He got an ordinary degree. </p> <p>Foecke took his case to Bristol's visitor - the Queen acting through the Privy Council - who in a brief letter upheld the university's decision. \"The visitor is an establishment body and looks after its own side,\" he commented. His lawyers attempted to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights but his application was rejected. Foecke says he now has no further legal options to clear his name unless he can obtain lecture notes from fellow students on his statistics course in 1985/86. These would, he believes, show that he could have produced his answers legitimately. </p> <p><strong>Who are the visitors?</strong></p> <p> <strong> The Queen</strong>, acting through the privy Council of the Lord Chancellor. Enough said. </p> <p><strong> The Queen Mother</strong>. Now that her 100th birthday celebrations are over, she'll be happy to give you her full attention. </p> <p><strong> The Duke of Edinburgh</strong>. Overseas students might think twice. </p> <p><strong> The Duke of Kent</strong>. Best not to call during Wimbledon fortnight. </p> <p><strong> The Archbishops of Canterbury and York</strong>. The hotline to God should see you all right. </p> <p><strong> The Bishops of Durham, Ely, Exeter, Lincoln, Oxford, St David's and Winchester</strong>.

  "<p>There isn't a professor on the planet who doesn't know the feeling of lecturing a roomful of bored, listless students, their eyes so heavily glazed over they look more like doughnuts than budding philosophers and politicians. </p> <p>Some of those professors, hoping to pump oxygen into the room, pepper their lectures with hip cultural references. They urge their students to see the parallels between the lives they are studying and their own. They drop references like Watergate into a lecture on the Clinton impeachment, for example, the Kennedy assassination in a class on Macbeth, or the similarities between sixties feminist Gloria Steinem and eighties Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>Except in the United States, professors now find even this doesn't work any more. Those eyes continue to glaze. Watergate? Isn't that a hotel? The Kennedy assassination? Aren't they a rock band? Margaret Thatcher? Wasn't she, like, Clinton's girlfriend at Oxford? </p> <p>And so, behold <a href=\"http://www.beloit.edu/~pubaff/releases/Mindset-List-2004.html\" target=\"_NEW\">The Mindset List</a>. Created in Wisconsin at Beloit University by humanities professor Tom McBride, it is a list of modern cultural references teachers need to know when lecturing, and is the hottest topic in American academia since Chelsea Clinton chose Stanford over Yale. Since its release last week, it has been faxed, emailed and posted to desperate university professors all across the country. </p> <p>\"We drew it up because we found more and more that our professors were making references that were getting blank stares,\" says Professor McBride. McBride says for students entering university this September, all born in 1982, references to the Berlin Wall, Yugoslavia or vinyl LPs are going to fly over their heads like B52s (which they think is a rock band anyway.) \"Today's 18-year-olds have had a narrow experience with popular culture and we can't presume they understand certain references that are second nature to us. The list reminds the faculty of the gap that may exist between generations.\" </p> <p>The Mindset List is 50 points long, but McBride said he has found certain statements resonate with professors everywhere, regardless of subject they teach. Among them are: </p> <p>\u0095 lf they vaguely remember the night the Berlin Wall fell, they are probably not sure why it was up in the first place. </p> <p>\u0095 The Kennedy tragedy was a plane crash, not an assassination. </p> <p>\u0095 A 45 is a gun, not a record with a large hole in the centre. </p> <p>\u0095 They never knew Madonna when she was like a virgin. </p> <p>\u0095 Punk Rock is an activist movement, not a musical form. </p> <p>\u0095 Wars begin and end quickly; peacekeeping missions go on forever. </p> <p>\u0095 They have never referred to Russia and China as \"the Reds\". </p> <p>\u0095 Women sailors have always been stationed on US Navy ships. </p> <p>\u0095 Woodstock is a bird or a reunion, not a cultural touchstone. </p> <p>\u0095 Coming-out parties celebrate more than debutantes. </p> <p>\u0095 They have never seen white smoke over the Vatican and do not know its significance. </p> <p>\u0095 They have never used a bottle of White Out. </p> <p>\u0095 Spam and cookies are not necessarily foods. </p> <p>\u0095 They feel more danger from having sex and being in school than from possible nuclear war. </p> <p>\u0095 Yugoslavia has never existed. </p> <p>\u0095 The moonwalk is a Michael Jackson dance step, not a Neil Armstrong giant step. </p> <p>\u0095 They don't think there is anything terribly futuristic about 2001, and were never concerned about the year 1984. </p> <p>And he points out that he doesn't think the necessity of a list is a uniquely American problem. \"My guess is professors in the UK are running into the same wall. They have students who probably think that only the Royals have scandals, and have never heard of the Profumo affair.\" </p> <p>Professor McBride, who is also the director of Beloit College's First Year Initiatives, compiled the list with contributions from faculty and staff. He first started thinking about a cheat sheet for professors five years ago, while teaching a liberal studies course: \"We taught a course called Facts, Fictions and Regions in Between. We chose two texts, Macbeth and Case Closed (about the Kennedy assassination), as both illustrate problems with facts and fictions. And it became obvious to me that the Kennedy assassination did not resonate with the students. Of course this doesn't prevent them from learning, as you can learn about many things you don't live through, but it gave me pause.\" </p> <p>And so two years ago the first list came out, but with each year is getting longer, and this year went into wide circulation. McBride says that while academics really love the list, students, when they read it, tend to get a tad defensive. \"One student recently told me, 'The list is wrong, we do use White Out. We do use pens, from time to time!' \" </p> <p>Yes but only when their computers crash. McBride says the problem of today's first-year university students arriving in September with a limited database of cultural references is due in part to the explosion of media and the arrival of the Internet. </p> <p>\"I have been teaching for 28 years, and there is a bigger disconnect now between students and teachers than there has ever been. Students today are exposed to so much more information, but it's all so chaotic. There are more magazines, more television networks, and their attention spans are being shaped by MTV and the Internet.</p> <p>\"We have lost of a sense of great books, for instance. Students today glean what they know from a more decentralized set of information banks, so finding a common discourse is more difficult. Twenty years ago I would teach a first-year class about substance and shadow, truth and illusion, and students would know I was referring to the story of Plato and the cave. I don't think you could assume they know that today.\"</p> <p>McBride says that if experience is any guide, professors take the list more seriously than they admit. Last year some said they dropped references to Watergate from history lectures, or made time to explain what it was. \"They see you simply can't drop these cultural touchstones in lectures any more, you must explain them. The point of the list is that we want to keep professors from getting hardening of the references,\" he jokes. </p> <p>Napier University, Edinburgh, addresses the problem in a course for lecturers which alerts them to approaching subjects from the students' point of view. \"Jokes are dangerous when you go cross-cultural,\" admits Shirley Earl, head of teaching development. \"But if lecturers can't show humour and character, things would be very dull.\"</p>",
  "<p>If the return of alarm clocks, pencil cases and bells is filling you with misery, take comfort, you are not alone - about 10 million pupils return to school this week. Your teachers, too, will be getting reacquainted with the classroom whirl and a life measured by piles of unmarked books. Pretty dismal, eh?</p> <p> But it need not be. The new term is a chance to start all over again. Some of the tips below may help. </p> <p> <strong> Back pain</strong> As many as 40% of schools have no storage facilities for their pupils and yet in workplaces special rules state that adults should not carry anything weighing 20% of their body weight for more than 10 minutes. But not so in schools. The charity, BackCare, says that such limits do not apply in schools, where a great many children are regularly carrying up to a quarter of their actual body weight in bags.</p> <p> If you have to cart your possessions around, forget fashion. Get a rucksack and wear it properly on your back. Hanging a heavy weight from one shoulder is a great way of guaranteeing you'll end up as a lop-sided grown up. School furniture, too, is often \"pretty appalling\", says BackCare's Karen Penny. Most British pupils have to sit at flat desks in chairs that encourage them to hunch over their work - a disastrous posture for those whose spines are still forming.</p> <p> \"When sitting down, a person's bottom should be higher than their knees and the writing surface should be angled too,\" she says. Contact BackCare for more details on 020-8977 5474. </p> <p> <strong> Bullying</strong> Thousands of young people suffer bullying. Between 1998 and 1999, Childline had 23,332 calls on the subject. But the longer it goes on, the harder it is to stop it. If anyone tries to menace you or put you down, act quickly - tell an adult. </p> <p>If they exist at your school, you may want to go to a \"peer mediator\" - an older pupil trained to listen and help people settle in. Bullies often have serious problems themselves and so the sooner their behaviour is challenged the sooner they can be helped. Contact: Kidscape: 0207 730 3300, Childline 0800 1111. Childline Scotland has a special line for people being bullied: 0800 441111. </p> <p> <strong> Ditch the diet?</strong> Don't listen to classroom dieticians. Recent figures suggest 33% of girls between 13 and 15 are trying to lose weight - although half of them in that age group say their weight is \"about right\". Researchers suggest peer-pressure may be to blame - dieting because it's fashionable. So have you got good reasons for dieting? There are far better ways to get slim and be slinky!</p> <p> <strong> Exercise</strong> There are real fears we are turning into a nation of slobs. So, stop skulking at the back of the gym. Bring your trainers and remember your kit. Over half a million hours of PE have been cut from primary school timetables in recent years to include new parts of the curriculum and only a quarter of 14- to 15-year-olds get the minimum amount of exercise they need. We should all take 20 minutes of physical exercise at least three times a week - are you? </p> <p> <strong> Sleep </strong> In June this year, the Journal of Sleep Research reported that 25% of 9- to 14-year-olds do not feel \"rested\" at school and that 15% had sleep problems. Miss your regular dose of eight hours' shut-eye and you may find you are more irritable and depressed. </p> <p>Professor Gregory Stores, head of research in child sleep disorders at Oxford University, puts much of this sleeplessness down to the TVs, computers and videos in bedrooms that keep children up late and prevent them \"winding down\" at the end of the day. 'Bedrooms should be places to sleep, not places to entertain yourself,\" he said. </p> <p>You don't have to sling all your electrical goods out of the window, just turn them off earlier. And if your homework is keeping you awake to all hours, there's something wrong and you need to talk to your school about how much you are being set. </p> <p> <strong> Study</strong> However old you are, you need to have some goals. For example, you cannot become a fluent French speaker overnight but by learning a few extra words every week your vocabulary will be \"formidable\" by the end of the year. The greatest skill you can gain at school is the ability to learn. Study expert Tony Buzan* recommends not working for more than half an hour at a time. When working at home, take regular breaks and set yourself reasonable targets. </p> <p> If you have problems following lessons, check where you sit. Research by Heriot-Watt University in October 1999 showed many UK classrooms have \"dead spots\" - places that are so poor acoustically that pupils sitting there missed nearly half the teacher's words. </p> <p> <strong> Sun</strong> If it's hot this autumn think twice about topping up your summer tan. If you must turn sun-worshipper between lessons, use enough suncream to make it work. If you are running around, reapply it frequently. </p> <p> Every year 40% of school age children get sunburnt and, according to cancer researchers, it takes only six bouts of childhood sunburn to double the chance of skin cancer in adulthood. </p> <p> <strong> Smoking</strong> </p> <p> Just don't get started. Cigarette companies need to recruit thousands of new young smokers every year because lots of their old customers die. If you are hooked, hearing lots of grisly facts and seeing images of diseased lungs is not likely to make a difference. You will only be able to give up when that is what you want to do. </p> <p>It does not help when schools give mixed messages. It is crazy that smoking is still permitted in 60% of school premises and that 10% of students can claim to have seen teachers smoking when they have visited the staff room.

  "<p>Our images of the seasons were fixed long ago by poets. Zingy spring is the year's number one erotic zone when young men's fancies lightly turn etc. </p> <p>Come misty autumn, everyone is mellow and knackered. September is about as sexy as the Citizen's Charter. </p> <p>But it's just not true, as anyone knows who has invested in one of those enticing booklets which pop up on newsagents' shelves as the summer starts to fade. </p> <p>For years now, autumn for the British has been the season for flicking through guides to local evening classes and musing: \"Hm. Scuba or Sanskrit? French or fretwork? Which will bring romance? </p> <p>\"Practical cake decoration or Proust? Where will I pull? </p> <p>\"Law or lace-making? How will I get my le...\" </p> <p>Stop! You can take alliteration too far. And what crass exaggeration! Every autumn, countless people embark upon an evening class with a single aim in mind: the pure pursuit of knowledge. Learning for its own sake. To improve the mind. Elevate the spirit. </p> <p>Of course they do. </p> <p>But many others idly flicking through these catalogues are not so focused. They want to learn something, sure, but they also want to meet sympathetic types. And maybe after class they might find themselves in a pub with one of their fellow students. And if perhaps the new mutual desire for the Etruscans is suddenly overtaken by a different sort of magnetism... </p> <p>Nobody knows how many people go to evening classes in the hope or expectation of finding love. </p> <p>That may be the next task for Professor Richard Scase, of Canterbury Business School, whose recent research into dating agencies revealed that one in five single Britons now use them. </p> <p>But probably not, because one senses an unwillingness to acknowledge the erotic potential of learning. </p> <p>Why? The notion that learning should be pushed for its own sake to adults is laudable, but nobody believes it, least of all the government. </p> <p>Ministers dubbed it \"lifelong learning\" and have been telling us that if we don't all dose ourselves up regularly with it, we're doomed. This minatory approach hasn't scared kiddies off hard drugs and may prove as fruitless with learning. </p> <p>And so there is a hip new line: learning is good for health. But if that strategy worked we would all be eating green vegetables five times a day. </p> <p>So far nobody has fallen back on the commonest advertising pitch: learning can bring you love. It is plausible. Much more so than: if you buy this particularly nasty looking leather sofa, the blonde woman with beautiful legs lounging on it in the ad is going to start dropping in on you. </p> <p>Finding yourself week after week in a room among people with a shared interest and struggling with similar problems gets you past those daunting initial hurdles. It gives you a topic of conversation and a legitimate reason for pursuing it. The rest is up to you. </p> <p>But how would such promotion work? Once one college or adult ed institute tried it, they would all have to follow. And the punters would want more information. And that, in education these days, inevitably means league tables, not just ranking institutions, but topics. </p> <p>Eventually the public would be told which courses virtually guaranteed amorous success and which were dead ducks. Tango for Beginners would no doubt regularly score highly. But what about taxidermy? </p> <p>You never know. A lonely Irish colleague on my first newspaper calculated that Holiday German looked most promising. The morning after his first class his glum look said it all. It had been an entirely male turnout. </p> <p>I, on the other hand, honestly did not hold out hope for Arabic. I was simply going through a T E Lawrence phase. But there were three young air hostesses in the class that first evening. They had all joined a middle eastern airline and wanted to be able to stand at the top of the steps and say: \"Welcome,\" or \"Goodbye,\" to their passengers. </p> <p>We covered that in the first lesson. They never came back.</p>",
  "<p>It's been a good year for Malcolm Wicks, and he was due for one. An expert in social policy and the welfare state, he was shadow social security minister before the election, and was bitterly disappointed not to get the social security job, or any other job, after Labour's 1997 election victory. He was probably passed over because he was thought too Old Labour, with his belief in universal welfare benefits and his ability to say \"socialism\" with no apparent embarrassment.</p> <p>Today he can see the silver lining. He wouldn't be happy running social security in a government which has gone down the road of means-tested benefits: he's spent a lifetime saying that welfare benefits were not just for the poor and dispossessed, but a right of citizenship. \"Poor people's services tend to be poor services,\" was how he put it. </p> <p>Instead, last year, he was pitchforked into education as Minister for Lifelong Learning, with (so it's said) an additional brief of reconnecting Labour with its heartlands. At first he felt like a fish out of water, but a few weeks into the job he realised that lifelong learning was a crucial aspect of social policy. He's probably also noticed that the more disillusioned Labour's heartlands get with Blair, the more indispensable Wicks becomes. </p> <p>He has successfully steered the learning and skills bill through parliament, with much less fuss than was expected. Like most politicians, though, he'd rather talk about the next frontier than about consolidating the last one, and he admits that the next few months are going to be hard work. He says he has to get the new councils to work - many of them don't have chief executives yet - while ensuring that the TECs and the Further Education Funding Council work effectively, even though they are about to be abolished. He admits the funding council has already encountered problems. </p> <p>And the new councils have to make sure colleges run the courses they identify as necessary, which won't always be easy. If local colleges won't run them, someone else will have to be found, he says, and it's clearly intended as a warning to colleges. </p> <p>In August, so quietly that no one has yet noticed, he acquired an additional responsibility, for basic skills. This means that it will fall to him to bring in a package of measures in the autumn designed to end adult illiteracy and innumeracy. For the moment, he's on the up escalator. </p> <p>The opposition to the learning and skills bill seemed to crumble before him. It is generally welcomed on Labour's left (unlike Labour's policy for schools). Colleges see it as heralding the day when further education ceases to be the Cinderella sector. And the Conservatives got themselves hopelessly impaled on Section 28, so that on the last day, after hours of filibustering, Wicks was able to jibe that they had kept everyone in the House of Commons until 3am, a time when anyone who gave a damn about family values would want to be at home with their partners and children. </p> <p>And the package incorporated at least one of his own pet ideas, the Connexions strategy, which gives every young person between 16 and 19 a personal adviser, to help them make not just educational and career choices, but life choices, too. (Connexions is supposed to be spelled that way. It's the old way of spelling it, says Wicks, though uncharitable commentators think some spin-doctor thought a clever graphic might come out of the X.) </p> <p>Business leaders at first welcomed Connexions, seeing it as a way of ensuring that skills shortages were put right, but grew progressively less enthusiastic as it became clear that Wicks saw it as a way of countering social exclusion. \"You've got 157,000 young people - almost one in 11 of our 16- to 19-year-olds - who are not in education, training or work\" he says. Everyone is supposed to benefit from Connexions, but it will focus especially on those 157,000. </p> <p>As it happens, he met one of them recently - a girl in his Croydon constituency, who had found her own place in a sixth form to study for A-levels, but had a small baby and did not know where to turn for childcare. Wicks sorted it out, but not every girl in that position would find her way to her local MP. That's what personal advisers will be for. </p> <p>Wicks sees education not as a grey matter of standards, exams, qualifications, but as \"potentially the most effective battering ram against social inequality.\" He's not so much moved from social policy to education, as brought a social policy training to bear on education issues. He recalled for me that Lord Beveridge, whose report at the end of the second world war signalled the birth of the welfare state, identified \"five giants\" which had to be slain: want, idleness, disease, squalor - and ignorance. More than half a century later, the Moser report reveals widespread adult illiteracy, and \"it's really wrecking people's lives.\" Ignorance remains to be slain.</p> <p>That's probably part of the reason why, in Labour's heartlands, his area of responsibility is less under attack than most. He spectacularly wooed this year's conference of the further education lecturers union, Natfhe, and cemented the relationship over lunch with the discovery that he and Paul Mackney shared a passion for Bob Dylan - the magical bonding effect of which can only be understood by fellow fifty-somethings. Mackney later sent him a copy of Dylan's new release, symbolically called Things Have Changed. </p> <p>He's the unions' favourite education minister, given their growing distrust of Blunkett and their edgy relationship with Wicks' predecessor, George Mudie. But they want a great deal more than he's delivering. He's found an extra \u00a350m for lecturers' pay, but it will still leave them a long way behind schoolteachers, and he has failed to deliver a right to paid time off for study. But \"we're getting a hearing now, and he's committed to lifelong learning\" says Mackney. </p> <p>That may be the result of his own education. The son of the last Labour chairman of the old London County Council, Arthur Wicks, young Malcolm was sent from London to a rather strange private school in Guernsey, which he disliked, and where he did badly, getting poor O-levels. (He failed British Constitution, \"just the right background for a government minister\" he says.) So he did A-levels at the North West London Polytechnic, making him one of the first people to discover that further education was a much more adult way for a 17-year-old to study. </p> <p>\"Further education gave me my second chance,\" he says. \"Suddenly I was in a much more adult, mature environment, with lots of overseas students. But because of my poor O-levels, most universities would not consider me.\" Fortunately, the London School of Economics, where he did his degree in social policy, proved the exception, but he says: \"That's when I realised that one should not put hurdles in front of people - you should have a second, third and fourth chance at education if you want it.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's that time of year again: university clearing is in full swing; headteachers are anxiously checking their staff lists; and university departments are photocopying like crazy for the new term's intake.</p> <p>And this year, as every year, engineering, maths and physics departments face the annual shortfall in qualified applicants, while other faculties gear up to teach remedial maths to chemistry, biology, economics and psychology students who can't cope with the basic textbooks. And it's the time of year, too, when teacher training colleges find their phones ringing off the hook as frantic headteachers call in the hope that somehow, somewhere, there might be a bright new maths teacher on offer. </p> <p>Maths education in this country is in crisis. For decades now England and Wales have been caught in a spiral of decline. At GCSE level, less than 20% of students now follow the \"top\" GCSE course, which contains some appreciable algebra and geometry. This is little more than half as many as in 1993. It is also a considerably lower percentage than used to do O-level maths. The result: fewer than 20% of our students are in a position to go on to A-level maths, and of course, not all of them do - currently about 9% of the cohort, a figure that has been static for years. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the gap widens between supply and demand for the mathematically trained, and especially the mathematically trained teacher. Recruitment onto maths PGCE courses has been plunging for years. Large numbers who do qualify never teach; numbers leaving maths teaching have risen hugely. Successive governments lower recruitment targets, and then fail to fill them - even this year's salaries for trainee teachers have not brought the maths graduates in. Heads know just how many classes they are having to staff with non-specialists who are teaching at the edge of their own mathematical knowledge. </p> <p>Does it matter? Yes, enormously. As colleagues and I argue in a new book published today, what is happening threatens our economic prosperity, the quality of our universities and the intellectual development of our young people. Worse, many of our elite simply do not understand the problem. Government spokesmen respond to research on students' mathematics problems by citing the national numeracy strategy. But when mathematics has disintegrated, no amount of arithmetic teaching is going to put things right. </p> <p>Let's look at Sally, for example, co-ordinating a big department in a major City investment bank. She was a student on a financial mathematics course. Students were asked: \"If you take \u00a3100, and add 8%, you get \u00a3108. What happens if you take 8% off the answer?\" To which Sally - and she was not alone - replied, \"I know the answer's not \u00a3100, but I've always wondered why. I thought it was because numbers were weird.\" </p> <p>Teach percentages once: students forget them. Teach them again (and again and again): adults will still be fumbling for the rule, and panic at anything but the simplest calculator-friendly question. That is the problem with concentrating on numeracy. </p> <p>But get beyond just following the rules - get, in fact, to the point where you understand some mathematics, and the desperate scrabbling in your memory stops. Instead, you are operating well inside the knowledge envelope - you can show why 8% off \u00a3108 isn't \u00a3100, not just check for yourself that, this time, it isn't. You can work out the formula to take VAT out of prices, not just add it onto them. You may even have more success than I did in a screaming match with my 10-year-old son, who insisted, \"Percentages have to be less than 100. They have to. Miss says.\" </p> <p>Mathematics isn't a collection of miscellaneous rules. It teaches people to identify structures and describe relationships - and it is for this quality of thought that top consulting firms such as BCG recruit over whelmingly from science and engineering graduates. For the great mathematician Alfred North Whitehead, mathematics was \"the most original creation of the human spirit\", which he loved for the way it lit up the unobvious. The rest of us can share some of this - there is a real kick to be had in proving that something has to be the case, that you've got a general relationship, not just some arbitrary sets of numbers. </p> <p>Of course, people do need to be numerate. The fortunately short-lived fashion for not teaching children their tables was crazy. But so is the reaction. Instead of worrying about maths, our politicians worry obsessively about numeracy. Perhaps it is because so many are lawyers and historians whose own maths is so limited. Perhaps it is those headlines comparing British and Japanese children's performance on arithmetic. But the result is an obsession with number, compounded by a passion for \"real life\" contexts that mostly aren't real at all. Do we really help students by turning every question on fractions into one about pizzas? </p> <p>The rest of the developed world treats proper, taught mathematics for all upper secondary students as a given. But for our 16- to 18-year-olds, the flagship policy of two successive governments has been the introduction of a \"key skill\" of \"application of number\" - alongside their A-levels or other post-GCSE qualifications, all students are to be assessed in areas like numeracy and literacy.</p> <p>Key skills go national this month, with schools being offered strong financial incentives to encourage all students to take part. But that doesn't mean they are all finally going to learn some maths. Instead, they are expected to rush around collecting examples of number work from their other subjects, topping the exercise off with a short multiple-choice numeracy test. </p> <p>Our first, most desperate priority is more good teachers: maths, of all subjects, doesn't teach itself. Instead, we are losing those we have - like the old college friend I ran into the other week. After years of teaching in further education, she was quitting. Her further maths A-level class had been dropped as unprofitable, and she was worn out with endless GCSE re-sit classes, drumming in the same material and knowing that almost all the students would fail again.</p> <p>Our shrunken mathematical base means there are no quick solutions. Attracting and training good maths teachers involves a long-term, expensive commitment. But to continue as we are flouts economic common sense, deprives our students of opportunity, and guarantees a bigger problem a few short years ahead.</p> <p>\u0095 Alison Wolf is professor of education and head of the Mathematical Sciences Group, Institute of Education.

  "<p>Most parents find primary school a breeze. They can do the homework, know their way around, occasionally chat with their child's teacher and are on nodding terms with the head. The schools generally welcome them; in the classroom, at assemblies and on outings. Yet while the move to secondary school is acknowledged to be traumatic for children, their parents can also feel lost and alienated.</p> <p>An ICM poll earlier this year found that while many parents were happy with their children's primary school, they became less satisfied with their education and teachers at secondary level. \"Secondary schools are not terribly keen on parental involvement,\" says Margaret Morrissey, spokeswoman for the Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations. \"They like the PTAs to raise money but there is no ethos of parents being welcomed into the classrooms like in primary schools. You have to rely on what your child comes home and tells you about what's going on at school - there is no easy contact with teachers. </p> <p>\"Unlike primary schools where there is just the child's teacher and headteacher involved with your child, there may be 15 people teaching your child during the week. At parents' evening, you're lucky to get five minutes with a teacher in a large school hall where whoever is passing can hear what's being said, when really you need half an hour in a private room.\" </p> <p>This was certainly Joanne Dyer's experience. When her daughter started secondary school she was surprised by the lack of communication. \"We felt the school was high-handed. With the uniform, for example - we studied the list we were given closely and bought a pair of trousers that seemed suitable, only to have them banned because they weren't the right fabric. We felt they just changed the rules as they went along.</p> <p>\"And then, later, when my daughter kept getting detentions whenever she forgot a book, I had a real struggle to change their attitude. Eventually I persuaded them that if she had a problem with maths they would help her, and they should be more cooperative with her organisational difficulties, too - but it took weeks even to get to see anyone.\" </p> <p>But things may be set to change. Increasing parental involvement in secondary schools is high on the Department of Education and Employment's agenda, and the education secretary, David Blunkett, is expected to launch a major new initiative to encourage just that next week. And it is not just parents' hurt feelings they are worried about. </p> <p>Educational research in the US and UK shows that parental involvement improves children's reading and numeracy scores and promotes long-term academic achievement and positive attitudes and behaviour. It may also encourage life-long learning. These benefits are seen particularly at secondary school level. As a way of raising standards, it is not only effective but cheap. </p> <p>\"Parents may have the perception that children don't need them to be involved so much at secondary school but its not true,\" says Morrissey. \"It's just less hands-on. If you know your child is failing at school, then in theory you can work with the teacher to improve your child's work and raise standards. And the more the school understands your child's life outside of school the better they will be able to give them the personal and social education they need to prepare them for life in their community.\" </p> <p>According to Ted Wragg, professor of education at the University of Exeter, there are studies from 40 years ago that show the positive effects of parental involvement. \"One study persuaded some schools to invite parents in to see lessons and their children's work, and the other schools carried on as usual. The schools that involved parents saw reading scores go up. The other schools' reading scores stayed the same except one, whose head had been so horrified by his school's scores taken before the study started, that he employed an extra teacher and a classroom assistant. These were the measures needed to raise the reading scores to the same level as the schools that invited parental involvement.\" </p> <p>Prof Wragg believes that parents shouldn't be put off if they can't understand their children's secondary school homework. \"It's different when you are reading a book with your child at primary school to when your teenager is doing GCSE physics, but it is the actual level of interest parents show that is important,\" he says. \"It is the parental attitude that has a strong influence on children's achievements, not their knowledge of particular subjects. Parents should ask their children to explain to them what they are doing. Kids learn by explaining.\" </p> <p>Secondary schools have increasingly involved parents over the past couple of decades, says Prof Wragg. \"Successive legislation has given parents the right to be informed about their child's school, which is why all secondary schools have prospectuses, why there are parents' evenings and why parents have to make up a quarter of the schools' governing body. We have come some way since there were lines in school playgrounds beyond which parents were not allowed to go.\" </p> <p>Dr John Dunford, former headteacher of Durham Johnston Comprehensive School and general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, says that schools are getting better at reporting to parents. He points out that some schools have more parents on their governing bodies than they are required to have by statute, giving them influence over the financial management and policies of the school. </p> <p>\"We have moved from a situation where parents were held at arm's length. They are now seen as an important partner in the education process,\" he says. \"We try to open up schools so parents feel more confident about contacting the school. Their own memories of school may prevent them from getting involved. </p> <p>\"We try to get them involved in target-setting; for example, some schools invite parents in to discuss with their child and their child's teacher at key stage 3 (when the child is 14) which GCSEs the child should do. Some schools invite parents in during the day to see what their children are doing. My school held evening events about school subjects where parents came in and did the work their children were doing. Parents don't always know how hard their children are working and it's tremendously important that children know that their parents understand their work and any problems they have at school. </p> <p>\"When there is that understanding, then you have a constructive triangle between the child, parent and teacher and it's a success. There is no question that it is harder for a child to succeed in school if the parents have no interest,\" Dunford says. </p> <p>Richard Fawcett, head of Thurston Community College (which takes pupils at 13) and president of the Secondary Heads Association, claims there are lots of examples of good practice, particularly around the move from primary to secondary school. \"We have links with the middle schools and our heads of houses and heads of departments go into these schools in the final year and meet the children and discuss with their teachers any circumstances we should be aware of. </p> <p>\"We invite parents to come for an evening before the start of school to hear about the school's organisation and to meet their child's tutor. At that meeting I say 'please get on the phone and come in and talk to us. We want to meet you at an early stage'. </p> <p>\"Our tutor system is different in that we have mixed age groups, of eight year 9 pupils (13-year-olds) and eight each of years 10 and 11. Each tutor, who is designated to look after and support the children, only had to get to know eight new pupils. The child stays with that tutor for three years. If they have a brother or sister at the school then they join their tutor group, so we get to know the family. A child who is in difficulty at school may have difficulties at home.\" </p> <p>He points out that there are probably 50 statutory requirements around the information that schools have to provide for parents, including the school's arrangements for reporting on their child's progress, the exams they have and the arrangements for homework. </p> <p>His school, like many others, provides homework diaries which parents must sign weekly, \"but receiving paperwork and understanding what is going on are different things,\" says Fawcett. \"If you get the relationship right between the school, home and pupil then it is powerful and it works. The ideal relationship is one that is open and confident, with both sides respecting each other's views, which can share success and talk about problems openly.\" </p> <p>Some parents, of course, prefer to leave well alone. Clare Bennett, whose son William goes to Highgate School in London, believes she is as involved in her son's education as she needs to be. \"William gets a report every month with grades for effort and achievement, and every term I get a long written report. The school sent me lots of information about their policies. I have one parents' evening a year. Frankly, it suits me not to be too involved - I am very busy. Like many parents I work longer hours now than when the children were younger. I don't want to get as heavily involved in their secondary school as I was in their primary school.\" </p> <p>But many others will welcome a national strategy on how and when parents should be involved. Margaret Morrissey, for one, will be delighted. \"There is an urgent need for a strategy on how schools consult with pupils and inform parents at a secondary school level. Teacher training courses should include courses on how to communicate with parents.</p> <p>\"Some teachers are excellent at talking to children, but it is a different skill to communicate with parents. We always hear about aggressive parents but if parents are invited in for good things in the school and develop an understanding of the school, then when they have to go in because their child has a problem, they are less likely to be aggressive.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Names of parents and children quoted have been changed.</p>",
  "<p>When Kevin Macdonald and I first discussed making a film about the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, we were clear as to why we wanted to do so. It didn't take much research to realise that neither the full extent of the tragedy nor a true account of what actually happened had ever been told in such a way as to make an indelible mark in people's memories. Perhaps the problem was best summed up by the chirpy words of former German government spokesman Conrad Ahlers who, midway through the crisis, referred to it as \"an unfortunate interruption\" which \"will all be forgotten in a few weeks\". Amazingly, it seems he was right. </p> <p>The challenge was how to tell the story without being sidetracked into the quagmire of the Arab-Israeli conflict, while treating the subject with the balance it demanded. We knew we had a responsibility to offer Palestinians, Israelis and Germans equal opportunity to speak. We didn't need much nous to realise our only chance of making the film we wanted to was to research the hell out of it. </p> <p>In Israel, the situation was straightforward. We knew who we wanted, and we knew we could interview them. But it was downhill from there. Conflicting reports made it hard to ascertain whether one, two, or none of the supposed surviving Palestinians were still alive. What was clear was that whoever was alive had never talked, and that our chances of persuading them to were minimal. Without a credible Palestinian voice, we had no film: therefore, that voice became a priority. When, several months later, we got wind that one man was alive and might speak to us, we simply didn't give up until we got him. </p> <p>In the meantime, we embarked on what we assumed would be the relatively easy process of finding the right people to interview in Germany. Wrong. With the notable exceptions of Walther Troger, mayor of the Olympic Village in 1972, and General Ullrich Wegener, the aide-de-camp of Federal Minister Hans Dietrich Gensher, we were met by total non-cooperation. In some respects, the wall of silence was so deafening it suggested more was being covered up than we were aware of. Our suspicions increased when Kevin flew to Germany to meet a group of strangers and was told \"we know who you are, we know what you are doing, and we will not talk to you\". We had more fixers in Germany than anywhere else and still we could not persuade key people to cooperate. </p> <p>Things changed only when veteran producer Arthur Cohn joined the team. Having made several feature documentaries, Arthur used his unique powers of persuasion and fluent German to their best, working feverishly to persuade people to be filmed. The culmination of his work came one week before we finished editing (eight months after filming began) when Gensher finally agreed to give us a \"statement\" on film. He sat down, said one sentence, refused to answer any questions, and left. </p> <p>We didn't want to make an anti-German film - to do so would have undermined the entire project. Also, as both Arthur and I are Jewish, the film could be dismissed as obviously pro-Israeli if it seemed to pick on the Germans. But sadly, the behaviour of the German authorities had been such that telling the story any other way would have distorted the truth. The events in Munich had been swept under the carpet and that, we learned, is exactly where the German authorities wanted them to stay. </p> <p>Given our obsession with even-handedness, the reaction thus far has been mostly gratifying. There has, however, been criticism. In Israel, some say the film is biased towards the Palestinians, with some of the victims' families accusing us of \"humanising\" a terrorist. In the Middle East, some say it is biased towards the Israelis - none more so than the Palestinian intellectual Edward Said. Said fired various criticisms at us, concluding that the film was \"bad cinema, bad politics and bad thinking\", and accusing us of ignoring the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict - thus ignoring the fact that our film is not about that history. What we do is offer one of the Palestinians involved the opportunity to contextualise the Palestinian position at the time. </p> <p>As Said feels he has a point to make, he does himself a disservice by making it in an article full of untrue accusations. If you accuse people of filming a subject in shade in order to dehumanise them, you need to check the subject did not insist on being filmed in shade. If you accuse a production company of not working with Arabs, you need to check the credits carefully before you do so. And, if you accuse a film of having no new information, you might like to check the recent archives to see a front-page story in a Sunday broadsheet featuring one of the many revelations from the film. Ultimately his attack on us is not much better than the German journalist who lambasted us without mentioning that he had neither seen the film nor spoken to us. Said had seen the film, and should have known better than to use it as a political platform for the 50-year war. </p> <p>We always knew there would be people who did not like the film. What we tried to do was tell a tragic story in such a way as to make sure it never needs telling again. We feel that we met our goals as best we could and, with files full of good reviews , as well as an Oscar sitting in the producer's and director's living rooms, we assume we must have done something right.</p> <p>\u0095 One Day in September, 9pm, BBC2</p>",
  "The leadership of the Ulster Freedom Fighters yesterday vowed to support Johnny Adair, the notorious commander returned to jail two weeks ago, scuppering hopes of an immediate end to the murderous feud with the Ulster Volunteer Force on the Shankill Road in Belfast. <p>The UVF had indicated at a rally on Saturday it was ready to make peace with the UFF if it took tough action against its second battalion's C company, led by Adair.

European internet growth is accelerating as the cost of bandwidth falls, more people and businesses come online and the European telecoms market is liberalised. </p> <p>CityReach takes a \"modular\" and almost militaristic approach to construction, containerising its generators and air conditioning units at an off-site location in the Netherlands and simply dropping them into place by crane. A 150,000sq ft facility can be built from scratch in six months for around \u00a320m. </p> <p>Visitors to CityReach's internet hotel on the outskirts of Schipol airport in Amsterdam face a daunting check-in at reception. Passport identification is needed, cars are searched for bombs and visitors must pass through metal detectors. Inside, CCTV cameras cover every angle and infrared alarms are triggered if a ceiling or floor tile is moved. </p> <p>Security has to be high: CityReach guarantees customers that their servers will be active 99.9999% of the time. \"If the servers are down for more than eight minutes in any one year customers are entitled to claim some of their money back,\" said its chief financial officer, James Lewisohn. </p> <p>The race to build exchanges could, however, be stalled by a lack of power, Mr Lewisohn warned. Each server consumes large quantities of electricity and has to be constantly cooled by chilled water systems. </p> <p>Mr Lewisohn said that Britain could miss out on hundreds of millions of pounds of new economy investment if power firms did not themselves reverse years of underinvestment in generating capacity. </p> <p>\"The internet has been a toytown in the first few years of its genesis. Unless we can guarantee the internet won't fall over and connections are constant, like telephones, it will be just like CB radio.\"</p>",
  "<p>Attempted political interference in the re-franchising of the railways was yesterday brought into focus by the looming crisis over the handling of the first important contract, that for a large slice of London commuter services. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, is seriously concerned that the two final bidders for the south central franchise are Connex, one of the worst performing rail companies, and Govia, which operates the Thames Trains service at the heart of last year's Paddington rail disaster. Mr Prescott is furious that the shadow strategic rail authority, which is responsible for awarding the 20-year contract, could have boxed itself into a position where the two final bidders come with tainted baggage. </p> <p>Officially the government has no influence on the deal. It is down to the SSRA's chairman, Sir Alastair Morton, to decide who willwin. </p> <p><strong> Time bomb</strong><br> </p> <p>Sir Alastair has still to make up his mind but has already made clear that he is unhappy with Connex's performance. Far from improving, it is getting worse. </p> <p>Connex's misfortunes have tended to hide the potential timebomb ticking away under Govia, Connex's main rival for the franchise. Govia is an efficient and successful company operating Thameslink, probably the best run commuter train service in London. </p> <p>Unfortunately, it is associated with Thames Trains. The driver of the Thames Train, which sped into the path of an approaching Cheltenham to London high speed express at Ladbroke Grove, was said at the crash inquiry to have been given little or no written instruction on train paths into Paddington station. </p> <p>Mr Prescott has no powers to force the SSRA into making a decision. The organisation is independent of government and says that it will make up its own mind, but Sir Alastair has a fraught few months ahead of him as he decides which, if any, of the two companies he decides to promote. </p> <p>The Conservatives last night took advantage of the delicate political situation to drive home several points about the awarding of the new contract. Their transport spokesman, Bernard Jenkin, wrote to Mr Prescott suggesting that the renewal of the London south central franchise was \"very sensitive\" and a \"very important one to get right\". </p> <p>While he held no brief for either company, Mr Jenkin said he was concerned that the tender process should be fair and transparent. \"Any hint of political interference would certainly undermine the entire re-franchising process,\" he said. Mr Jenkin reminded Mr Prescott that he had set up the SSRA, appointed a new rail regulator and a new chairman of the Heath and Safety Executive, with the ultimate responsibility for safety on the railway. </p> <p>Why, he asked, should the government interfere if the SSRA thought it was all right for both Connex and Govia to bid for the new franchise? </p> <p>The answer is that the government is only taking a reasonable precaution. The industry is privatised and the government no longer has the hands-on influence it used to wield when rail was under state control. But it is still paying out more than \u00a31bn a year to the industry in subsidies and would argue that it has a right to have its voice heard in a situation which could result in a political backlash for ministers. </p> <p>There is a possible solution. For some reason, known only to the SSRA, greater emphasis is being laid on handing out new franchises without waiting for a new strategy for the industry. </p> <p>But Connex's existing franchise does not expire until 2003. The government may want to see action and progress, coupled with more investment, but there is no reason why the new contract has to be awarded in such a hurry. </p> <p>Some ministers are beginning to suggest that if Connex and Govia are flawed, then the SSRA should put the process back into the melting pot and re-franchise. This would give other companies the opportunity to come forward and head off problems which are bound toarise. The first for Connex is the next list of punctuality and reliability statistics from the SSRA. For Govia, the problem is Lord Cullen's forthcoming report into the Paddington rail crash. </p> <p><strong> Quick fixes</strong><br> </p> <p>With a general election approaching, the government is anxious for quick fixes on transport. It would very much like to notch up a few successes, but they are not easy to come by. </p> <p>It is unfortunate that the London south central franchise has been singled out as a \"must do\" project, because it is flawed. Connex, owned by the French multinational Vivendi, stressed yesterday that its bid was a serious one and that it was not running down any services. </p> <p>It said that it had not made drivers redundant, rather that they had been poached by other companies and that it was short of skilled workers. </p> <p>Govia's senior managers believe Lord Cullen will be far more critical of Railtrack's role over Paddington and say that they have done their best to deal with a difficult situation. </p> <p>This may be true, but the present re-franchising process has exposed the pitfalls of rail privatisation: not enough well-respected companies in the field which have produced the goods for passengers.</p>",
  "Being Britain's most popular politician was, in the end, not enough to save Mo Mowlam. Public approval ratings topping those of Tony Blair reflected the cabinet co-ordinator's love affair with the public but at Westminster they fuelled rivalries that were to help bring her down. <p>As the Redcar MP's husband Jon Norton put it yesterday: \"Popularity is not always the most popular thing among one's colleagues.\" </p> <p>Ms Mowlam's decision to quit follows a long whispering campaign that saw her health and ability questioned by senior figures in the government, with even the prime minister said to be frustrated by his star attraction. Her spectacular announcement yesterday came only a month after she used a New Statesman interview to insist that her political obituaries were premature. \"I don't plan to go. No,\" she insisted in early August. </p> <p>Yet Labour colleagues in north-east England had been privately speculating for months that she could go despite again easily topping the Guardian's cabinet popularity poll this summer. </p> <p>The support of millions of voters could not save her from sniping from some of Labour's most senior figures, which appears to have left her fed up with Westminster and ready for a new challenge. </p> <p>And it was claimed last night by a senior member of the government that last October she made a bad career move, turning down a chance to become health secretary after leaving Northern Ireland in favour of a Cabinet Office post she was to find \"humdrum\". </p> <p><b> Standing ovation</b><br> </p> <p>In truth her position within the government has been on the slide almost since Mr Blair's mere mention of her name during his keynote speech to the party's 1998 conference won her an extraordinary standing ovation. </p> <p>Sympathisers claimed No 10 could not cope with a minister more popular than the prime minister and had to bring her down a peg or two; critics argued she became out of control, believing she was untouchable and refusing to toe the line. </p> <p>The result was a series of stories in the media questioning her health and ability, at times fuelled by Ms Mowlam talking of her own problems, which reduced her to tears and, despite the official denials, exposed a growing rift between Downing Street and one of its biggest electoral assets. </p> <p>Earlier this summer she was rebuked by No 10 after repeating calls for the royal family to quit Buckingham Palace and move to a new home. Last January Ms Mowlam found herself in the middle of a row over drugs after admitting she smoked pot in her youth, the following month urging the police to target \"killer\" drugs rather than cannabis. </p> <p>Her decision to appear at the dog wedding on Channel 4's So, Graham Norton show raised eyebrows. If she had not jumped, in all likelihood Ms Mowlam would have been pushed after the election. </p> <p>Cash-strapped since Mr Norton lost his job in banking, the couple will keep their grace and favour flat in Whitehall's Admiralty House, and she has a deal reputedly worth up to \u00a3350,000 for her autobiography. </p> <p>That deal and an imminent biography by journalist Julia Langdon, the details of which Ms Mowlam checked, suggested that she was thinking of life after politics. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson, who replaced her in Belfast last Autumn, and Jonathan Powell, the No 10 chief of staff dubbed the \"Downing Street poisoner\", are expected to be accused by Ms Langdon - despite denials - of undermining Ms Mowlam. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson made clear his irritation with Ms Mowlam last week. \"If she chooses to co-operate with somebody like that and an exercise like that,\" he said, \"well that is her judgment.\" </p> <p>Ms Mowlam, 51 later this month, denied her health played any part in the decision to quit and maintained she had recovered from the brain tumour diagnosed shortly before the 1997 election. The whig has gone but at a party barely two months ago she appeared unsteady on her feet, being helped up and down a platform no higher than 12 inches. </p> <p>In Northern Ireland, Ms Mowlam can claim a genuine part in reviving a flagging peace process using her chameleon personality to charm both sides of the sectarian fence. She first risked offending the Catholics by allowing the unionist march through Drumcree following Labour's election. She also entered the Maze to treat with the Protestant paramilitaries. But her informal style and determination to bring Sinn Fein into mainstream politics gradually pushed her beyond the pale of unionist opinion. </p> <p>Her remarks questioning the principle of consent were too much for David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader. He found her dreamy, vacillating, offensive, and pro-Catholic. Within five months or so, he refused to negotiate with her on big issues demanding to speak directly with the prime minister or Mr Powell. </p> <p>Seamus Mallon, the deputy first minister, recalled: \"The first set of negotiations were in Hillsborough Council. I got the shock of my life. This was Mo's house, the place where she lived. Yet during those negotiations you had the secretary of state wandering about the corridors with other people wondering what was going on in the negotiations.\" </p> <p>Once her historic task of bringing Sinn Fein back to the negotiating table had been achieved, Mr Blair took on the minutiae of the talks. From that moment, ironically the height of her public popularity, her political star began to wane. </p> <p>Ms Mowlam's removal from Northern Ireland was deferred last summer when she protested over a planned reshuffle by Mr Blair and went on holiday to Turkey, but she was eventually forced to make way for Mr Mandelson's return to cabinet last October. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson and Ms Mowlam did not subsequently speak, a silence that spoke volumes about their relationship, whatever warm words were uttered in public yesterday. </p> <p>Maybe she could have had the health job. At all events, she ended up in a political cul de sac as Cabinet Office minister, an odd jobs posting with a bizarre collection of unrelated responsibilities. Some say she could have made more of the new job. Others say there was no true cabinet-level job to do. </p> <p>Those close to her said she found the Cabinet Office's essential task of co-ordination - she eschewed the term enforcer - deeply frustrating. In part, the gifts required were much too similar to those that had been needed in Northern Ireland where she was trying to liaise between different parties, rather than initiate her own policies. In the Cabinet Office job, she was again asked to liaise, but not arbitrate, between warring Whitehall departments. </p> <p>This lack of independent power left her short of genuine room to make policy. The backroom, nitty gritty role, also seemed entirely inappropriate for her gifts of warmth, intelligent informality and communicating with the public. </p> <p><b> Animated </b><br> </p> <p>In theory in charge of drugs policy, she became genuinely animated by the issue, but found the home secretary, Jack Straw, and Downing Street blocking her desire to adopt a more liberal approach to the possession of cannabis. </p> <p>She also grandly had the job of co-ordinating the government policy to combat social exclusion. But much of the work was undertaken by the vigorous director of the social exclusion unit, Marjorie Wallace. The unit reported directly to the prime minister and many of the key decisions on its work programme were decided inside the Downing Street policy unit. The Treasury and Gordon Brown also rarely let any anti-poverty programmes out of their sight. </p> <p>Similarly, she nominally controlled policy on GM technology, but many of the big battles took place between the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Trade and the Department of the Environment. </p> <p>The same story could be said of rural policy, something she monitored, but did not control. </p> <p>It was Lord Falconer, her Cabinet Office colleague and Mr Blair's personal friend, who did much of the screening of cabinet committee papers. Lord Falconer, a barrister, is a consumer and synthesiser of papers. Ms Mowlam's commitment to detail, by contrast, was more sporadic. </p> <p>She also boobed by failing to halt (or if some are believed, encouraged) speculation that she could be Labour's candidate for mayor of London. Not only did she undermine Frank Dobson's prospects of defeating Ken Livingstone, she signalled her lack of interest in the post she held. </p> <p>Although temperamentally a Blairite - she was his campaign manager for the leadership - she never quite took the public lead on new thinking inside government, even though the Blair thinktank, the performance and innovation unit, operated from inside the Cabinet Office. </p> <p>This all left Ms Mowlam with bits and pieces: reducing red tape, modernising the mechanics of the civil service, the People's Panel, visits to drug rehabilitation centres, worthy plans to put government services on line. </p> <p>Her friends and critics in journalism also say she became her own worst enemy. Successive newspaper interviews with her focused on the supposed whispering campaign against her, the winning personality, or her political indiscretions. But she did few big serious interviews about her political ideas or policies. </p> <p>One lobby journalist on a broadsheet daily, friendly to her, asked to do an interview on her drugs brief, in the hope that it might project her as a weighty player, but she said nothing new. The reporter was reduced to recycling the stories about the supposed briefings against her, leading to a distressed complaint from Ms Mowlam the next morning. Some of the most scathing attacks on her also emanated from briefings she herself inadvertently gave, including a piece in the Independent on Sunday based on a briefing she gave to the paper's editor. </p> <p>Her martyrdom and fight against the brain tumour inadvertently became Mo Mowlam's own story. <br></p> <p><b>The gossip: More spinned against than spinning?</b></p> <p><b> Peter Mandelson</b> </p> <p>Cold and calculating, he is a different beast from the freewheeling woman he replaced as Northern Ireland secretary. </p> <p>Relations were strained from 1994 after Ms Mowlam, who publicly ran Tony Blair's Labour leadership bid, discovered that Mr Mandelson - codenamed \"Bobby\" - was privately calling the shots. </p> <p>The friendship broke down last year when Mr Mandelson pulled off a cabinet comeback and replaced her in Belfast. </p> <p>He denied being behind the whispering campaign questioning her health and judgment and her role in the peace process, but his form as a spin doctor puts him at, or near, the top of any list of suspects. </p> <p><b> Jonathan Powell</b> </p> <p>Tony Blair's chief of staff clashed with Ms Mowlam over Northern Ireland where he was No 10's man in the talks. </p> <p>Dubbed the \"Downing Street poisoner\" by Ms Mowlam's supporters, Mr Powell was frustrated by what he saw as her failure to grapple with crucial details and her poor relationship with the Ulster Unionists. </p> <p>He promoted Ms Mowlam as Labour's candidate for mayor of London in what was viewed as an attempt to get her out of Belfast but Mr Powell vehemently denies being behind any whispering campaign. </p> <p><b> Spin doctors</b> </p> <p>The official line is that Alastair Campbell and Labour's spin doctors have never said a bad word about Ms Mowlam and all assertions to the contrary are \"c-r-a-p\". </p> <p>The official line from a Millbank spin doctor on Sunday, when asked about speculation that she was about to quit, was: \"It has absolutely no basis in fact.\" It had and she did, and the party's high command was again caught out denying something that was true. </p> <p><b> Jealous colleagues</b> </p> <p>Her very popularity with the public made Ms Mowlam unpopular among a number of Labour backbenchers and ministers with lower profiles. While they conform, in the hope of climbing the greasy pole, she was unconventional and could reach people turned off by identikit politicians. </p> <p><b> Ulster Unionists</b> </p> <p>David Trimble and many Unionists were glad to see the back of her in Northern Ireland, complaining she was too close to the nationalists and republicans. The leader of the Belfast assembly made no secret of the fact he wanted her replaced, even touting Mr Mandelson's name shortly before Mr Blair shuffled his pack. </p> <p><b> Mo Mowlam</b> </p> <p>She can, admit some of her friends, be her own worst enemy. Ms Mowlam talked about her troubles instead of bottling them up, spreading at least some of the damaging media gossip about her health, life and work. </p> <p>The down to earth Ms Mowlam that won over voters is the same Ms Mowlam who can be short with Whitehall officials and anger cabinet ministers unused to such a blunt approach. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.cabinet-office.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a></p>",
  "A Ghanaian convicted cocaine importer has launched a high court challenge to the decision to deport him to his home country, claiming it would violate his right to family life under the European convention on human rights. <p>Ernest Doku, who was granted parole in June after serving four and a half years of a 12-year sentence, argues that the move would breach his human rights by separating him from his British wife and son, and from his two British daughters from an earlier relationship. </p> <p>Yesterday his counsel, Cherie Booth QC, failed to persuade a high court judge to release Doku on bail pending his application for judicial review early next month. His case is expected to be one of the first challenges to come to court after the Human Rights Act comes into force on October 2, incorporating the European convention into English law. </p> <p>Following a trial at Isleworth crown court, west London, in December 1995, Doku was convicted of being knowingly concerned in the importation of five kilograms of cocaine. He was jailed for 12 years and his deportation was recommended. </p> <p>He was granted parole in June but he continues to be held at the Verne prison, Portland, Dorset, while the papers for his deportation are being processed. </p> <p>For about 10 years before he came to the UK in 1976, Doku, 64, worked as a barrister for the Ghanaian ministry of justice. He married his British wife, Suzie, who lives in Wembley, north London, three years after arriving in the UK. Their son, Ernest, is at university. His daughters are in their 20s. </p> <p>Doku, who has a masters degree in social sciences and international relations, established a successful business exporting commodities and building materials to Ghana. He was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 1983. </p> <p>Ms Booth told Mr Justice Jackson that Doku had been a model prisoner, and had successfully completed a programme that helps prisoners develop a sense of self-respect and responsibility. He had since helped other prisoners complete the programme. </p> <p>But the judge refused him bail, saying there was a risk of absconding, particularly if the decision in a similar case to be heard shortly before his own went against him. </p> <p>The courts are bracing themselves for a raft of claims under the Human Rights Act, with immigration and deportation predicted to be a fertile area. </p> <p>Under the convention, the right to family life is not absolute. The state may legiti mately interfere with it for a number of reasons, including \"for the prevention of disorder or crime\". But the state must not go further than is necessary to achieve that aim. </p> <p>The European court of human rights in Strasbourg held in one case that there was no violation where the applicant brought his deportation on himself by breaching immigration controls.</p>",
  "One of Britain's most senior police officers is accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a darkened office during a series of incidents which left her and a female colleague feeling \"frightened, abused and vulnerable \" . <p>The deputy chief constable of Surrey, Ian Beckett, 54, allegedly put his hand inside one victim's underwear, groped the breast and bottom of another and made lewd remarks about knickers, Southwark crown court heard yesterday. </p> <p>The jury was told that Mr Beckett was \"unable to control his sexual behaviour\" and thought he could get away with his conduct towards the two civilian workers because he was second in command of the force and contemplating promotion. </p> <p>Mr Beckett, of Chertsey, Surrey, is accused of four indecent assaults on two women - given the names Miss X and Miss Y as they cannot be named for legal reasons - between December 14 and Christmas Eve, 1998. </p> <p>He has denied the charges, claiming the allegations are lies and fantasy. </p> <p>\"He took advantage of his position of seniority,\" Sallie Bennett-Jenkins, prosecuting, said. \"These assaults were committed in the belief the victims would never be able to complain. He was a man who abused his position of authority to carry out sexual assaults of increasing gravity.\" </p> <p>The women were allegedly attacked on December 14 1998 at Surrey's headquarters, Mount Browne, near Guildford. Miss X told the court yesterday that she was summoned into Mr Beckett's office, where he told her that the then chief constable of Surrey, Ian Blair, had been tipped by a newspaper to succeed Sir Paul Condon as head of the Metropolitan Police. </p> <p>She said they agreed Mr Blair, now deputy commissioner of the Met, would apply for the post, a move which would leave Mr Beckett in charge of Surrey. </p> <p>\"I got up to go and walked towards the door,\" said Miss X. \"At that point he moved ahead of me as if to open the door. In fact, he locked the door, and because it was daylight, he switched the lights off. I was very frightened. </p> <p>\"He was facing me and he put both his arms around me. My body was in contact with his. I said 'Mr Beckett, the chief constable is likely to walk in, you know he is. This is stupid'. </p> <p>\"He just smiled, let me go and unlocked the door. Afterwards I thought about what happened. I became very, very angry that he had threatened me. His behaviour worried me considerably.\" </p> <p>Miss Bennett-Jenkins said Mr Beckett targeted Miss X again on Christmas Eve and is alleged to have rung her the day before to ask if she would wear red knickers for him. </p> <p>On Christmas Eve, he called Miss X into his office and asked whether she had recovered from a recent illness. </p> <p>\"He hugged her,\" said Miss Bennett-Jenkins. \"He pinned her arms and put his left hand up her skirt. She said 'no, please, I have no energy to fight you'. The defendant said 'let me touch you'.\" </p> <p>Mr Beckett allegedly put his hand inside Miss X's under wear and assaulted her. She protested again. </p> <p>\"He let her go and wished her a happy Christmas,\" said Miss Bennett-Jenkins. \"Understandably she found this attack intolerable in the extreme.\" </p> <p>The court heard that after the first incident Miss X spoke to the chief constable, Mr Blair and said she felt physically vulnerable around Mr Beckett. </p> <p>He allegedly warned her to think carefully before making any formal allegations because it was \"a big step to take\". </p> <p>Miss X decided to pursue the complaint but her appointment with a senior personnel officer was not until January 5, 1999. Unknown to her, another woman had also accused Mr Beckett of assaulting her on December 14. </p> <p>The woman was in the assistant chief constable's office when Mr Beckett allegedly approached and said: \"You know I have always been fond of you.\" </p> <p>Miss Bennett-Jenkins added: \"As she walked towards the door he put his hand on her bottom, open handed underneath her buttock, almost between her legs.\" </p> <p>Mr Beckett is accused of assaulting Miss Y again a week later. On this occasion, Miss Bennett-Jenkins said, she was sitting at her desk when he crossed the room and \"without hesitation put his hand on her breast and kissed her on the lips.\" Miss Y immediately knocked his arm away. </p> <p>Mr Beckett was suspended on January 8 1999. </p> <p>He is said to have told investigators Miss Y might have been motivated by revenge because he had reprimanded some staff over the sending of an obscene email which depicted a snowman with an erection. </p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "\u0095When the histories of New Labour come to be written, the smear campaign against Mo Mowlam - one tolerated, if not actively commissioned, by that \"pretty straight guy\" Mr Tony Blair - will rank among the basest achievements of that poisonous little cabal. Whatever the reason for our most beloved Mo's departure, let's hope Mr T and the boys feel some residue of embarrassment. Yesterday, meanwhile, provided Nicky Campbell, presenter of Radio 5 Live's outstanding morning phone-in, with a journalistic triumph worthy of the Times' news editor Michael Govey. (It was Govey whose ground-breaking biography of Polly Portillo made no mention of his varsity experimentation, and Govey also missed the defection to Labour of Ivan Massow, his recent flatmate.) Even he would have been proud to have interviewed Mo's husband Jon Norton about his forthcoming art exhibition, without pressing him about the rumours. The interview ended at 11am - just as Downing Street made its announcement about Mo. <br> \u0095The News of the World political column of Sion Simon, who also writes in the Daily Telegraph and the Spectator, is a typically splendid read, not least for Sion's gift for reading the Labour leadership's thinking on every conceivable issue. Honestly, it's so uncanny one begins to suspect telepathy. One small point, though. To negate the risk that readers might be misled, wouldn't it be better if Sion considered changing his name by deed poll to Alastair Campbell?  \u0095I am surprised by the Bookseller's diary's response to the item here about Anthony Cheetham and the Fatty Cheetham song ... the ditty traditionally sung sotto voce to the tune of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, whenever the much-loved head of Orion enters a party. \"Wide, low, Fatty Fatty Cheetham, Fatty Fatty Cheetham we love you,\" goes the chorus. \"And our Fatty Fatty Cheetham, Fatty Fatty Cheetham loves us too ... Bang, bang, Fatty Fatty Cheetham, our fine four-bellied friend,\" and so on. Mistaking our tone, my so-called rival accuses us of \"sniping\" and announces the Friends of Cheetham - a body set up \"to lobby for, at the very least, a quiet life for this great bookman, and at best a knighthood\". We're behind that, and to end the confusion will make the first donation.  \u0095A recent front-page report in the Yorkshire Post comes to our attention. \"Ms Evans says her findings could prompt a revolution in traditional views about the British and their origins, although her views have been met by scepticism from scholars who believe her claims are based on scanty evidence,\" writes Mike Waites, \"and that the Egyptians had neither the technology nor the desire to travel to Britain.\"  \u0095The time has come to say goodbye to that fecund August space-filler, the dangerously exciting tourist attraction. We all know the Keswick Pencil Museum and the Yelverton Paperweight Centre, but here is a name check for a few others that surely deserve a visit: the Cardew Teapottery (\"Home of the World's Most Collectable Teapots!\") in Devon; the Salt Museum (\"Britain's only salt museum!\") in Northwich; the House of Marbles (\"masses of free parking\"), another Devon corker; St Helens' World of Glass (\"experience the mystery\"); the Chess Museum on Grimsey Island, north of the Arctic Circle; and, finally, the Mus\u00e9e du B\u00e9ret, \"unique au monde\", in Nay (Nay and thrice Nay), northwest of Lourdes.  \u0095It's also farewell to what was, I think, a very good inaugural Gerald Kaufman Month. Well, perhaps we can postpone it a little. Relentless plugging of Roger Law's forthcoming exhibition, in the hope that he will give us the Spitting Image Gerald as a competition prize, will ensue shortly. Meanwhile, we have done a deal with Cadbury's, and in pursuance of that the final picture of Gerald will appear tomorrow. Otherwise, that's it.",
  "The Labour MP Audrey Wise, who has died of a brain tumour aged 65, was a socialist, a feminist and a fighter. <p>She fought against whatever she felt was wrong and she thought that a great deal about the organisation of society was very wrong. She fought authority in general, oppression in capitalistic society in particular, and took on on all-comers. </p> <p>Born in Newcastle, the daughter of a former Labour councillor, she lived and breathed politics every moment of her life. She grew up with a profound belief in the need to recognise the proper role of women in society. Proudly, she described herself as a \"shorthand typist\", and continued to use that description as an MP - partly in the apparent belief that it might encourage other shorthand typists that anything was possible and partly to demonstrate her support for all women workers. </p> <p>At the age of 21, she became a Tottenham borough councillor in north London. In February 1974, she became Labour MP for Coventry South West, and soon attacked the authoritarian enemy on all fronts. She had already made a name as an opponent of the Vietnam war, and other foreign political causes she took up included Chile and Nicaragua. </p> <p>At Westminster in the 1970s she was regarded as something of a left-wing nuisance , a state of affairs that she viewed as necessary and desirable. She was part of a delegation to meet a representative of the Official IRA, she often voted against the then Labour government's economic policies, and was arrested on the Grunwick picket line, in that struggle to establish trade union recognition. </p> <p>Most significantly, with Jeff Rooker she co-authored the Rooker-Wise Amendment to Chancellor Denis Healey's 1977 finance bill. This introduced retrospective inflation-proofing on tax allowances, which led to \u00a3450m being handed back to taxpayers. It was an astonishing victory for two back-benchers and a testament to the power of a committed, hard-working, single-minded woman. </p> <p>Her most important work was that for which Wise received the least recognition among her political peers. It was on the behalf of women, children and families and, most specifically, about the way in which women experience childbirth. She lost her Coventry seat in the 1979 general election and was out of parliament until 1987. </p> <p>Once back, for Preston, she was made a member of the health select committee and persuaded her fellow members to hold an inquiry into maternity services. This led to a landmark 1992 report, which prompted the Conservative government to endorse the committee's findings and led to policies which offered women more choice and control of their circumstances during pregnancy, birth and post-natal care. </p> <p>The National Childbirth Trust's head of policy research, Mary Newburn, said that it was the impact of Wise's approach that had changed maternity services to become \"woman-centred\" and which has since led to a change throughout the NHS: the lives of women everywhere have been touched by her campaigning. </p> <p>From 1982 to 1987, Wise was a trouble-making Labour national executive committee member and a forceful figure in a number of the party's campaigning organisations. She was a member of the shopworkers' union, Usdaw - which was once her father's union - and was quietly proud of becoming its first woman president, from 1991 until 1997. </p> <p>Fiercely protective of her close, fond family life, she married her husband, John, a dispensing optician in 1953. </p> <p>When she found out about her illness last April, she was optimistic about the outcome and applied as much vigour to resisting it as she had all her life to her many political causes. As her family said yesterday: \"This was one fight she did not win.\" Audrey Wise would have appreciated the irony. </p> <p><b> Hilary Wainwright writes:</b> </p> <p> Audrey Wise's manner was that of a campaigner, an indefatigable activist, but many radical socialists, especially socialist feminists, will also remember her as a thinker of real insight. She listened. </p> <p>In her early 1970s pamphlet, Women and Workers' Control, she describes how women who say they don't want equal pay are dismissed as \"backward\". Equal pay was being proposed on the basis that women should accept the same conditions as men; for example, working nights. She recalls such a \"backward\" woman saying to her: \"If the economy wants women to work nights then I need a different kind of economy.\" </p> <p>\"We should encourage attitudes like that,\" said Audrey, who believed equal pay was important, but not enough. </p> <p>Her life combined the per sonal with the political in an exemplary way. The creative humanism of her socialism was apparent in everything she wrote. For example, take her 1970s article, Trying to Stay Human, in the socialist feminist magazine Red Rag. If nurseries were really to meet the needs of women and children, she insisted, it was not enough to demand them from the state: the state should provide resources, but the management should be under community control. She had no faith in the existing state, but a profound belief in democracy and the capacities of ordinary people. A radical extension of democracy was a constant theme of her life. </p> <p>I came to know her as one of the moving spirits behind the Institute for Workers' Control and because of her support for workers such as those at Lucas Aerospace who developed plans for saving jobs by turning arms factories over to the production of medical, environmental, transport and other socially necessary goods. But I was influenced by her through the bridging role she played between the women's liberation movement and the trade unions. Sheila Rowbotham invited her to speak at the first women's liberation conference at Ruskin College in 1970, and she stayed connected. The last time I heard her speak was at a meeting where she stressed the need for the left to take seriously the preservation of biological diversity. </p> <p>She was one of the many people dismissed as \"old Labour\" who were always thinking creatively about the future. If modernisation meant all power to the corporations, she needed a very different kind of future. And she contributed much to achieving that future. </p> <p>She is survived by her husband, son and daughter. <br> \u0095 Audrey Wise, politician, born January 4 1935; died September 2 2000</p>",
  "<p>Britain's leading employers' organisation is calling on the government to face down demands for paid parental leave and enhanced maternity rights, warning that the prospect of more employment red tape is the biggest single deterrent to investment in the UK. </p> <p>Digby Jones, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said that his members feared extra workers' rights legislation was being planned for the Queen's speech later this year in an attempt to woo Labour's core supporters in the run-up to the election. </p> <p>\"Enough is enough,\" Mr Jones said in an interview with the Guardian. \"We have had 16 pieces of employment legislation in two years. I hope Tony Blair and Gordon Brown will behave like statesmen and put the country first.\" </p> <p>Calls for further employment legislation, including paid leave for both parents and the right of women to return to work part time after maternity leave, will be on the agenda at next week's TUC conference in Glasgow and are also being pressed hard by grassroots campaigners inside the Labour party. </p> <p>However, with the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, announcing last week that the Conservatives will make cutting the regulatory burden on business a main plank of their economic strategy, senior ministers are concerned that new laws could jeopardise their cordial relations with the CBI and other employers' groups. </p> <p>In a clear effort to put pressure on the government to mothball any plans for further legislation, Mr Jones said that red tape was a common worry among CBI members and exacerbated the impact on busi ness competitiveness of the strong pound. Labour's attitude over the next six to nine months would be a test of its pro-business credentials. </p> <p>\"This government might talk about how it's business friendly, but they are coming into an election year and - notwithstanding a big majority and a big lead in the opinion polls - they are looking to their heartlands for support. </p> <p>\"The trade unions are saying that their support comes at a price and part of that price is more employment legislation.\" </p> <p>Mr Jones said the CBI would be producing a business manifesto at its national confer ence in Birmingham in November that would outline what was needed from the next government. </p> <p>He said that the CBI wanted assurances from Mr Portillo that the Conservatives would not renege on Labour's commitment to spend more on transport and to beef up regional development agencies, but that red tape was a key issue, particularly for small businesses and inward investors. </p> <p>\"I hope that the Queen's speech does not pander to Labour's core support and give away to the trade unions so many things in legislation, spending and tax that will do absolutely nothing for the competitiveness of Britain, nothing to create lasting jobs and nothing to show the boardrooms in Tokyo, Johannesburg and Detroit that we are the best place to do business. </p> <p>\"I fear there will be some parts of the government's legislative programme which will have some of the characteristics of their predecessors. </p> <p>\"The TUC has shown responsibility. It has dedicated itself to making Britain more competitive and we can see that coming through. I hope the unions don't lose the plot.\"</p>",
  "At least the members of the Scottish parliament got the important legislation out of the way early. Last year, on the historic first day of sitting, the newly elected members of the newly devolved institution agreed on the following: that they should all receive a bronze commemorative medal to mark their role in history. Exhausted by the legislative process, they then took a two-month holiday. Though not before deciding it would be a fine idea to commission a \u00a3200m building in which to conduct their future activities. <p>Tomorrow, when they start their second year in business, the members of the Scottish parliament will have a somewhat more rigorous agenda. Over the summer, the political news has made alarming reading for them. Take these headlines from the Daily Record, Scotland's biggest-selling daily paper, last Wednesday: \"Beleaguered ministers careers take turn for the worse; exam chaos spreads; waiting lists soar; union chiefs threaten autumn of discontent\". </p> <p>Meanwhile, Alex Salmond, the leader of the SNP, the official opposition party, has been spending the summer telling everyone who will listen that, technically, the Scottish economy is about to enter recession: receipts are below expenditure, imports above exports, with economic growth too low to mop up the difference. As birthday messages to mark the second year of devolved government go, the Scottish parliament could hardly have chosen a less complimentary one: much of the superficial evidence suggests this is a country which cannot rule itself. </p> <p>In truth, walking round the streets last week, Scotland does not look on the verge of economic collapse. Edinburgh in particular, with its endless new bars and restaurants and a housing market approaching London levels of ludicrousness, looks in rude economic health. In Glasgow, too, the buoyant central business district is full of busy corporations such as Scottish Power, Scottish Widows and Scottish Gas, whose nomenclature identifies them firmly with the sort of self-confident nationalism which would be reckoned business suicide south of the border. And, since everyone living outside the central belt is always quick to point out that Glas gow and Edinburgh are not the real Scotland, it seems advisable to report that business-wise things are pretty cheery elsewhere too. </p> <p>\"Shell has just announced a big increase in investment up here,\" says Amanda Harvie, of the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce. \"Without wishing to suggest we are approaching boom times, I'd say there was overall an upturn in confidence at the sharp end. That is not to pretend there are not real challenges ahead.\" </p> <p>As its defenders would point out, it is the challenges that the Scottish parliament has been set up to address. Success can get on by its own, it is failure that needs sorting out by government. And - impending recession or not - Scotland has enormous challenges beyond an apparent inability to mark examination papers properly. Bad health, bad housing, bad diet and drug abuse are endemic. It is a nation, too, identified by division: north/south; east/west; Lowland/Highland; rural/urban. Many of the divisions are even enshrined constitutionally: this is a country which still legislates to ensure Catholics and Protestants are educated separately. </p> <p>And it doesn't seem as if its globally expansive corporations are keen to help. As Stagecoach, Scottish Media and Scottish Power colonise the corporate world with a voracity to match their empire building forebears, they seem to have all but forgotten the local community from which they draw their wealth and expertise. In the past, Scottish business success was characterised by huge public projects (Andrew Carnegie was the typical Scottish philanthropist). Now success is marked by the size of directors' remuneration. Tellingly, the lottery-funded Museum of Scotland which has just opened to great acclaim in Edinburgh, is the only grand cultural building to be built in this grandest cultural city in the last century. Unless you count Murrayfield. </p> <p>Still, in case it may have forgotten the many challenges it faces, the Scottish parliament can always rely on its media to remind it. In an over-crowded newspaper market, Scottish papers seem to have decided that bad news sells. For his own political reasons, Andrew Neil has ensured his Scotsman keeps its teeth never far from the jugular. Even the traditionally Labour-supporting Daily Record has administered almost daily assaults on Donald Dewar and his team since the moment they took office. The failures of the examination system or fears of impending recession are given far greater prominence than the revelation that 29 new schools are being built in Glasgow alone. And always - with every piece of bad news - the new parliament is held accountable. </p> <p>\"There is a real schizophrenia in this country,\" says Frank McAveety MSP, the deputy minister for local government. \"The Scottish press corps lobbied harder than anyone for a devolved parliament, now they've got it, they're queuing up to give it a good kicking.\" </p> <p>For many observers of the Scottish scene - Billy Connolly for instance - there is nothing new in this symptom of a split national personality. In the new Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow's Exchange Square, it is there for all to see. Housed in a glorious legacy from the city's mercantile past, the gallery is full, not of the art of a self-confident, newly semi-independent country, but of gloom and pessimism. Albeit producing fascinating, visually arresting work, young Scottish artists seem obsessed with national shortcomings, failure and self-loathing. In their view everything appears to be wrong with Scotland, from its housing to its way with sex. The misanthropic whole is summed up by Ron O'Donnell's brilliant painting featuring a man bedecked in tartan, sitting in a room decorated with the memorabilia of plastic patriotism. He is slumped in an armchair, can in hand, watching the big match on television. Instead of a head he has a football. The painting is called The Scotsman. </p> <p>\"I think that painting's got it right: football really is an important metaphor for Scottish life, not least because we are so obsessed with it,\" says Sandy Ross, managing director of Scottish Television. \"For instance, you can't ignore the effect the 1978 World Cup had on the collective psyche. We went there saying we could beat the world and we were humiliated as only we Scots can be. I reckon Andrew Marr was right when he said this sense of 'we're crap and we know we are' which resulted from that campaign completely destroyed any chance of devolution the last time it was on the cards in 1979. We simply thought we weren't up to it.\" </p> <p>And if it isn't football, it's Thatcher. The 80s were a bleak time for Scotland, battered by recession, steam-rollered by brutalist economic theories, then spat on as the laboratory of the poll tax. For many in Scotland, it was easy to point the finger for failings. Though to be fair, it is not just paranoia: the English really do appear to have little concern for what goes on over the garden wall. </p> <p>\"Since I came to Scotland 10 years ago,\" says Gavin Stamp, senior lecturer at the McIntosh School of Architecture in Glasgow, \"I've become much more aware of English indifference to Scotland. I have friends who proudly tell me they have never visited Scotland in a way they would be ashamed to admit if they had never been to Paris.\" </p> <p>However justified, loathing of English control over a land for which there was minimal interest became endemic; the manner in which the Scottish Office doled out the money in an unaccountable fashion from Westminster was identified as the root cause of every evil visited on the country. </p> <p>\"The country became irresponsible, plagued by a moaning, defeatist culture,\" says Andrew Jaspan, editor of the Herald on Sunday newspaper. \"Every problem was blamed on London.\" </p> <p>Blame: an important word in the Scottish vocabulary. </p> <p>\"Oh yes, we're always looking for someone to blame,\" says Sandy Ross. \"The New Labour honeymoon was far shorter up here. We were already suspicious that Blair would desert us long before he was even elected.\" </p> <p>For the Scottish politicians who arrived after devolution in 1999, getting to grips with blame is part of the new job description. </p> <p>\"The Thatcher years distorted politics in Scotland,\" says Frank McAveety. \"It made it easy. We could all agree we hated her and she was to blame for everything. Now that's all over, there is a much more difficult job: deciding what we stand for and whether we can do it.\" </p> <p>Not that there is a general faith abroad that the parliament is the body to sort much out at all. It is hard to find anyone - unless they are employed by Holyrood - who has a kind word to say about the new Scottish political institutions. If there is any feeling at all for the parliament on the streets, it is the one neatly summarised by Billy Connolly who calls it a \"wee pretendy parliament\". Yet for some observers, the very fact Scotland at last has a parliament to sneer at is a major step forward. </p> <p>\"We may have a mess now with all this summer's cock-ups,\" says Andrew Jaspan, \"but at least it's Scotland's mess. For years it's been easy to say it's someone else's fault. Now people have to face up to it. And I think that's brilliant.\" </p> <p>Jaspan points to the debate about Section 28 as a perfect example of what he calls a \"growing-up process\" instigated by the arrival of the parliament. The debate was an ugly, divisive one. The bus billionaire Brian Souter bankrolled a campaign against its abolition which quickly ran out of control. Posters suggested that if Section 28 was removed from the statute books, buggery would become part of the syllabus. With the willing endorsement of the Catholic church and parts of the Church of Scotland, the anti-abolitionists whipped up a virulently homophobic fervour. </p> <p>\"A lot of people said that the debate over Section 28 was a disaster,\" says Jaspan, \"but I reckon it was probably the best debate Scotland's had for years. It challenged a lot of people who assumed we were a tolerant, liberal society to really look at themselves and defend the issues.\" </p> <p>Gordon Macdougall, the political editor of Scottish Television, agrees. </p> <p>\"A lot of my English friends told me that the Section 28 business showed what a backward, ugly nation we really were,\" he says. \"But at the end of it, Section 28 has been abolished up here and it is still on the statute books down south.\" </p> <p>For all its symbolic importance, however, Section 28 was still, in essence, an intellectual issue. When it comes to the nitty-gritty of finance, health, housing and education, the parliament does not yet appear to have proved that it can run things better than Westminster. </p> <p>\"A year is too soon to tell,\" says Frank McAveety. \"But I believe we are putting in place legislation which, in the long run, will change Scotland for the better. I think people had such high hopes of immediate change, there is inevitably a sense of anti-climax, but legislation takes time. I'm relaxed about the slagging off. It is a legitimate job of the press to examine. And you could say it's that good for the first time they really have something to examine.\" </p> <p>It would help, some observers feel, if the parliament could get its own PR right. Not just stopping blunders such as its self-important first day in office, but being much more active in explaining to voters just what it is up to. But in the meantime, for the first time in Scotland's parliamentary history, the boys and girls returning to Holyrood for the new term tomorrow have to face up to this issue: a summer of relentless bad news has got to be resolved not at 400 miles distance, but by them, on their fellow citizens' doorstep. </p> <p>\"It is the big question: can the Scots govern themselves? and we shall have to wait for the answer,\" says Gavin Stamp. \"Mind you, population of less than five million, edge of Europe, crap climate: the Norwegians seem to manage it.\"</p>",

  "The government proposed a thorough shake-up of the United Nations yesterday, including new guidelines allowing it to intervene quickly and with force in countries embroiled in humanitarian crises. <p>In a joint statement with the Liberal Democrats, it said the UN security council should be enlarged to include Germany, Japan and representatives from Latin America, Africa, and Asia, joining the US, Russia, China, Britain, and France, as permanent members. </p> <p>The joint statement from the Labour and Liberal Democrat joint consultative committee reflects the government's enthusiasm for intervening and its frustration at failing to secure international support. </p> <p>After pointing to the 1994 Rwanda genocide and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, and seizing on last year's statement by Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, that \"no legal principle - not even sovereignty - can shield crimes against humanity\" it said: \"Our two parties believe profoundly that it is no longer acceptable at the beginning of the 21st century that massive human rights violations and genocide go unchallenged.\" </p> <p>In what they called a \"framework for intervention\" they stated: \"When a government has shown that it is palpably unwilling or unable to cope with an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe, we believe that the international community has a duty to intervene.\" </p> <p>They added: \"The use of force must be collective and only in exceptional circumstances should it be undertaken without the express authority of the security council of the United Nations.\" </p> <p>Challenges in the statement to existing notions of sovereignty were echoed yesterday by the international development secretary, Clare Short. </p> <p>\"The old idea of national sovereignty, of being an island unto yourself _ is gone. The world is one,\" she told the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. </p> <p>But the principle that intervention in a country's sovereign affairs could be justified on humanitarian or human rights grounds is unlikely to be accepted by China if only because of Taiwan and Tibet. Russia, faced with Chechen demands for independence, is also unlikely to welcome it. </p> <p>Yesterday's statement conceded that UN reforms, including circumstances in which the UN's existing principle of sovereignty could be challenged, would require the unanimous agreement of the current five members of the UN security council. </p> <p>The UN's inability to mount speedy and effective military and civilian peacekeeping operations - shown up in Sierra Leone and Kosovo - must be addressed by developing \"standby arrangements\" and better UN training and leadership programmes. \"No longer must UN 'blue helmets' stand by while the most serious crimes against humanity are being committed,\" it said. </p> <p>The joint statement urged all countries to ratify the statute setting up an international criminal court (opposed by the US), the international conven tions against torture and racial discrimination, and the treaty outlawing landmines. </p> <p>It proposed a decommissioning body to control the destruction of small arms - responsible for more than 80% of casualties in modern warfare. </p> <p>Patrick Wintour writes: Liberal Democrat activists claimed that the proposals to restructure the UN security council breached party policy and had been specifically re jected by the party. The Liberal Democrats have called for regional seats on the security council with the current British seat being handed to the EU. Donnachadh McCarthy, a federal executive member, claimed the party's foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, sought unsuccessfully to shift the party's policy towards Labour's.</p>",
  "Emperor Hirohito was not the unworldly figurehead and reluctant warrior that he was painted by Japanese and western leaders after 1945, a new American book claims. <p>Rather, he was a much more enthusiastic supporter of expansionism and military aggression than it suited either Japanese or American interests to acknowledge, then or since. </p> <p>From the end of the second world war until his death in 1989, the American historian Herbert Bix writes, Hirohito was at the centre of an assiduous effort to present him as a remote leader who bore no personal responsibility for Japan's war aims and deeds, against China in the 1930s and the US and its allies in 1941-45. </p> <p>This version of history is little more than myth, he says. Hirohito's role in defining, urging and supporting Japanese war aims, and the active part he played as commander-in-chief of the armed forces in wars which cost the lives of 20m Asians and more than 3m Japanese, make him \"the central symbol of his people's repression of their wartime past\". </p> <p>In Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan Mr Bix argues that \"secrecy, myth and gross misrepresentation\" surrounded the emperor, above all in the attempts to depict him as a constitutional monarch with little direct role in policy making, and in the creation of the fiction that he was a pacifist who opposed the attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941 and was eager for a dignified surrender in 1945. </p> <p>Conservative Japanese and American cold-war interests converged in the effort to establish this version, the book argues. General Douglas MacArthur, who headed the US occupation after atom bombs were dropped on Japan in 1945, persistently argued to Washington that the emperor must remain on the throne if the US was ever to bring its forces home again. </p> <p>Much of the basis of the post-war myths, says Mr Bix, a professor at Hitotsubashi university in Tokyo, is in the \"Monologue\" on his wartime role which Hirohito dictated to MacArthur's aides in March 1946. It was not published until after Hirohito's death. </p> <p>He wrote that \"as a constitutional monarch under a constitutional government\" he \"could not avoid\" approving the decision to go to war. Elsewhere he described himself as \"virtually a prisoner and powerless\" in his dealings with \"the militarists\". </p> <p>But, Mr Bix writes: \"Hirohito omitted mention of how he and his aides had helped the military to become an enormously powerful political force pushing for arms expansion. </p> <p>\"He ignored the many times he and his entourage has made use of the Meiji system of government by consensus to stifle a more democratic, less militarised political process. </p> <p>\"He intentionally fudged the details about his role as both a military leader and a head of state, blurred his motives, and obfuscated the timing of his actions and the logic that informed them. </p> <p>\"He was silent too about how he had encouraged the belligerency of his people by serving as an active ideological focus of a new emperor-centred nationalism that had grown up around him.\" </p> <p>Hirohito was \"smarter and shrewder than most people gave him credit for\". Never was his cunning used more effectively than in the last 40 years of his life, when he became the only wartime enemy leader to retain his post and to be rehabilitated both at home and in the west. </p> <p>But the image of the remote poet-emperor and marine biologist which preceded his visits to Europe and the US in the 70s was classic spin doctoring. </p> <p>From late 1937 onward Hirohito became \"a real war leader,\" Mr Bix writes, influencing strategy and helping to appoint commanders. </p> <p>The history of his rule before 1945 is \"inextricably bound up with the history of Japanese militarism and fascism\". </p> <p>After 1945, \"it is connected to efforts by ruling elites to roll back [American] occupation reforms, check Japanese pacifism, and regain the attributes of a great-power state.\"</p>",
  "An elderly woman had her right leg amputated above the knee after a doctor failed to diagnose gangrene in her foot, the General Medical Council heard yesterday. <p>Ndalai Majiyebo Abaniwo saw June Cockburn, then 65, in his surgery and at her home but gave no indication of the seriousness of her condition, the GMC's professional conduct committee heard. </p> <p>Zoe Johnson, for the GMC, said Dr Abaniwo, a GP at the Five Elms Surgery in Dagenham, Essex, had put her discoloured big toe down to poor circulation and advised her to get more exercise. He did not get her to make a follow-up appointment. </p> <p>Dr Abaniwo's notes of the appointment on March 31 1998 suggested he had diagnosed peripheral vascular disease but had not informed Mrs Cockburn or her husband. </p> <p>Mrs Cockburn continued to experience severe pain and the discolouration spread. Two weeks later her husband, Robert, called Dr Abaniwo to their home. Ms Johnson said: \"Despite the obvious deterioration in her condition, Dr Abaniwo ... failed to explain the potential seriousness of her condition.\" </p> <p>Four days later Mrs Cockburn's daughter-in-law, Sherie, called the surgery and Dr Abaniwo said he had done all he could and that Mrs Cockburn needed to go to hospital. </p> <p>Ms Johnson said this was the first mention of the need for hospital treatment and of the possibility of gangrene. </p> <p>Mrs Cockburn went to the accident and emergency department of Oldchurch hospital and three days later her right leg was amputated. </p> <p>Dr Abaniwo denies serious professional misconduct and failing to safeguard his patient's best medical interests. He rejects failing to indicate how serious Mrs Cockburn's condition was. He also denies that the record of his home visit was \"confusing, and untruthful\". </p> <p>Dr Abaniwo told the hearing he had warned Mrs Cockburn at his surgery that if she did not stop smoking she would end up with complications and this could lead to amputation of the toes. He told her and her husband to make an appointment to see him again if there was no improvement. </p> <p>On his home visit, he said: \"I asked about going to the hospital but she refused.\" </p> <p>The hearing continues today.</p>",
  "Russia's summer-long struggle for control of national television turned sharply towards victory for President Vladimir Putin yesterday when the influential Russian media mogul, Boris Berezovsky, announced that he was surrendering control of Russia's main state channel. <p>The concession, coupled with a searing attack on Mr Putin's campaign to tame the free media, left the Kremlin confident that the two most important television channels in Russia and the most formidable sources of opposition were being brought to heel. </p> <p>In what was seen as a big victory for Mr Putin, who has made control of the media, particularly national television, a central plank in his campaign to entrench his political power, Mr Berezovsky said he was surrendering his 49% share of ORT, the main state television channel, to \"journalists and intellectuals\" after coming under intense pressure from the Kremlin and being presented with an ultimatum. </p> <p>In a letter to Mr Putin, leaked to the Interfax news agency, Mr Berezovsky said one of the president's most senior aides had told him he had a fortnight to get rid of the ORT shares. Mr Berezovsky alleged he was threatened with imprisonment if he continued to defy Mr Putin. </p> <p>While Mr Berezovsky stressed he was surrendering his shares into the care of ORT journalists, his letter appeared to be an admission of defeat, crowning a summer of media wars between the Kremlin and the two big national television channels. </p> <p>ORT, meaning \"public Russian television\", is the equivalent of BBC1 and the only Russian channel broadcasting to the entire country. </p> <p>Vladimir Gusinsky, Mr Berezovsky's rival and the owner of NTV, the country's biggest private channel, is in exile in Spain after being briefly jailed, having his offices raided, and being pressured to transfer control of the station to Gazprom, the gas monopoly which is acting as a proxy for the Kremlin. </p> <p>\"We share Berezovsky's concern for the future of the freedom of the press in Russia,\" Mr Gusinsky's Media-Most company said in a statement last night. </p> <p>In an outspoken attack a fortnight ago, Mr Putin accused both magnates of being liars and thieves and rounded on both stations for their coverage of the Kursk submarine tragedy. </p> <p>Mr Berezovsky's letter stressed that he was forced to surrender control of ORT, arguing that Mr Putin had confronted the public with \"a very important question - whether or not non-state mass media have the right to exist in Russia\". </p> <p>He said the Kremlin aide presented the ultimatum last week. \"I should either transfer my ORT shares to the state within two weeks or follow Gusinsky\" - he was obviously referring to prison. </p> <p>Mr Berezovsky pointed out that if he accepted the ultimatum, \"television information will come to a halt in Russia, to be replaced by television propaganda controlled by your advisers\". </p> <p>Mr Berezovsky has exploited his control of ORT to promote his political agenda, which last year included putting Mr Putin in power. He has since fallen out with the Putin administration, resigned his Duma seat, and launched a new movement of \"constructive opposition\" to the Kremlin. </p> <p>Both Mr Berezovsky and Mr Gusinsky are widely reviled as super-wealthy \"oligarchs\" by the public and Mr Putin remains hugely popular among Russians. </p> <p> <b>The rise and fall of a media mogul:</b> <br> \u0095 In a Byzantine political culture where backroom dealing is the preferred modus operandi, Boris Berezovsky, left, is Russia's foremost schemer </p> <p>\u0095 He rose to prominence in the early 90s following the collapse of communism by diligently cultivating Boris Yeltsin and his influential daughter Tatyana Dyachenko </p> <p>\u0095 He built his fortune in the car and oil industries, benefiting from the corrupt privatisation process in Russia in the early 90s and the \"loans-for shares\" arrangements agreed between Russia's political and business elites in the mid-90s </p> <p>\u0095 As part of the partial privatisation of ORT, the main state television channel, Berezovsky acquired a 49% share of the only broadcaster with a nationwide reach and used that clout to promote first Yeltsin and then Putin. He also extended his media empire to ownership of several newspapers </p> <p>\u0095 With Yeltsin trailing in the polls in 1996, Berezovsky and his media rival Gusinsky joined forces to put the two big channels at Yeltsin's disposal and win him a second term against the odds </p> <p>\u0095 Last year he performed the same trick for Putin, destroying the president's rivals through a vicious television campaign of character assassination </p> <p>\u0095 A Swiss inquiry into claims that two of his companies were siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars from the national carrier, Aeroflot, have been repeatedly stymied and last month the Russian prosecutor investigating the allegations was sacked </p> <p>\u0095 Berezovsky and Putin have increasingly been at loggerheads since March. Berezovsky appears peeved at losing his place in the Kremlin inner circle and has been using his media to attack Putin on Chechnya, policy toward the regions, big business, and on the handling of the Kursk tragedy </p>",
  "<p>At one time, passing the medical examination before a big-money transfer was nothing more than a formality for the British professional footballer. Of the stars of yesteryear only the lank-haired 70s maverick Frank Worthington truly botched one, missing out on a move from Leicester City to Liverpool because of high blood pressure. </p> <p>In Worthington's estimable autobiography One Hump Or Two, the elegant striker puts his condition down to overexcitement created by a week of sensual excess in southern Spain. A look at the book's photo section suggests another possible cause: over-tight knitwear. When you've an orange-and-brown striped tank-top cutting off the circulation to your arms, doing The Bump in a Malaga nightspot is likely to send all that displaced haemoglobin shooting out of your ears. </p> <p>Alas, such easy-going attitudes to transfers are now a thing of the past, as John Hartson discovered on Thursday at Ibrox when he flunked his second high-profile fitness test of the past six months. On the previous occasion this happened, last season at White Hart Lane, a \u00a37m move collapsed as the result. On that occasion the chunky Welshman's agent Jonathan Barnett commented bitterly: \"Even Mother Teresa would have failed that fitness test.\" </p> <p>No wonder Barnett was disappointed. Though George Graham's insistence that new signings have a thorough knowledge of theology and are willing to sacrifice personal comfort to minister to the sick (insert your own Darren Anderton joke here) is commendable, it speaks volumes for the insane world of modern football that the game's rulers now expect the honest British pro to display more stamina and athleticism than a dead Albanian nun. </p> <p>In the days of Worthington and Co things were very different. Fitness tests were less sophisticated. Character was the thing, the ability to withstand pain, hardship and the interminable Norman Wisdom impressions of the team's dressing-room joker. Usually the prospective new signing was simply shown a picture of the Scandinavian sex bomb Britt Ekland in a bikini and if he responded with a hoarse \"Phwoar!\" he was considered to have all the attributes necessary for the red-blooded hurly-burly of the Football League. </p> <p>After all, when centre-backs trundled about the pitch like runaway traction engines and referees displayed as much compassion towards the victims of violence as Caligula, fitness was a transient thing. There was little point in wasting a doctor's fee to find out a player was in prime condition when two weeks later he was likely to be lying in a hospital bed contemplating a career as a publican with an ankle joint that offered a more accurate prediction of coming damp spells than Bill Giles at the London Weather Centre. </p> <p>Players were cheaper too. In those days purchasing a pre-owned centre-forward was a bit like buying a used car. You approach the motor with a look on your face that you hope conveys a mixture of steely toughness and extensive mechanical knowledge. You lift the bonnet, scratch your head, kick the tyres and if no bits fall off you cross your fingers and hand over the cash. Now signing a player is more like investing in a house. You have to have a thorough independent survey before the bank will advance the money. </p> <p>Insurance is the key, of course. Terms and premiums are based on risk. If Fifa hadn't outlawed the tackle from behind, forwards might all have become as hard to secure cover for as a firework factory on the slopes of Mount Etna. As it is the expensive but fragile likes of Ruud van Nistelrooy still put the wind up the insurers. </p> <p>It is possible that all this effort might end up working in the clubs' favour in an unexpected way, of course. After all, now that Uefa seems about to scrap transfer fees for players over the age of 24, big-money buys such as Luis Figo will be allowed to simply walk away from a club after 12 months. In this situation the club becomes like a householder with negative equity. An insurance settlement may be the only way to recoup an investment. </p> <p>A couple of likely lads, the keys left in an obvious place and the next thing you know your expensive playmaker's been left a burnt-out shell. Or been clattered from behind by an uncompromising No5 in exchange for a backhander. Either way it's the kind of pay-off that will keep those shareholders happy.</p>"
