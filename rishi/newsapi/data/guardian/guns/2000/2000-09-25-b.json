  "<p>A flyer in the match programme describes this season as \"likely to be the most successful in the club's history\" and though premature talk can often lead to lasting embarrassment, the only question remaining after this performance is how soon it will be before Fulham secure promotion. </p> <p>Andy Hessenthaler had few doubts about the performance he had witnessed from close quarters. \"They are the best side we have played so far, we just couldn't get near them,\" he said. \"They taught us a lesson and I'm quite pleased it was only 3-0. A lot of Premier League sides could come here and not get anything.\" </p> <p>Gillingham's chirpy player-manager, who three days earlier played a part in their honourable draw at Manchester City, saw his gutsy team finish a distant second to the leaders Fulham, who in the process equalled the eight straight league wins they managed under Kevin Keegan at the start of the Second Division championship season of two years ago. </p> <p>Not that their player-coach John Collins is getting too carried away. Indeed his comments were a measure of how far Fulham have come in a short space of time. \"It was below par today and we've played better than that,\" he said. \"We were a little bit slack with our passing in the first half.\" </p> <p>Ten seasons back Alan Dicks's relegation side waited 11 games for their first win while as recently as February 1996 Fulham plunged to second bottom of the Third Division before Ian Branfoot was shunted upstairs and Micky Adams took control of the team for the visit of Exeter. </p> <p>That game was won 2-1, Fulham moved up a place and so began an ascent which seems certain to realise Premiership football for next term. </p> <p>\"We are passing teams off the park. There are a lot of players here who could play in the Premier League,\" Collins added. \"We believe that if you pass for 90 minutes teams tend to tire. It's been the case in the previous seven games. But it takes a lot of hard work in the first half to make it look easy in the second.\" </p> <p>So it came to pass on a sunny afternoon which saw the ground staff watering the pitch until five minutes before kick-off to minimise any chance Gillingham had of hustling the hosts out of their stride. </p> <p>Fabrice Fernandes could have got the ball rolling for Fulham early on but his shot hit the inside of a post and after Louis Saha finished a fine run with a chip which whistled over, it was left to Steve Finnan to produce a testing cross which the unmarked Barry Hayles chested down and lashed into the roof of the net. </p> <p>Hayles then slipped a ball through to Lee Clark who drew Vince Bartram before lifting the ball into the corner. And late on the striker added his second when he got past three defenders before firing into the top corner. Another job done.</p>",
  "<p>As I get older and perhaps wiser, I realise more and more what I do not know. I still don't know what makes people happy although I am a good deal more knowledgeable about what makes them sad. I don't know now whether there is a God, when once I did believe and with a passionate conviction. I don't know whether good mothers are born or made, what turns some people into leaders and others into the led, nor whether in my lifetime we will see the cure for cancer, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. </p> <p> What I do know is what it is like to be a man. However, as I reflect on how I learned about masculinity and manhood, I realise that almost all the teaching was implicit and all the learning by way of a kind of osmotic process. I don't recall anyone, my father, my mother, my teachers, my peers, saying 'This is what it means to be a man, a son, a brother, a lover, a dad'. Yet I learned very early on that what a man does; his work is as important as, even more important than, who he is; that a man is defined in modern capitalistic society in terms not of being but doing. </p> <p> My career, particularly my medical career, was always portrayed and interpreted, by others as much as by myself, as more important than spouse, family, friends. During my undergraduate and postgraduate training, first in medicine, then in psychiatry, I never ever witnessed a male colleague admitting to putting his family first. Male colleagues would blithely arrange late evening meetings of this or that committee and be surprised and irritated when female colleagues pointed out that domestic duties made their attendance impossible. For a male to make such a statement would have marked him as someone not committed to his job. Most male colleagues were busy demonstrating how they worked all the hours God gave them. It was like chimps beating their chests and baring their teeth. Often, it was just about as productive. </p> <p> In an interview published in the New York Times back in 1912, Carl Jung observed that the libido of American men: </p> <p>is focused almost entirely on his business, so that as a husband he is glad to have no responsibilities. He gives the complete direction of his family life over to his wife. This is what you call giving independence to the American woman. It is what I call the laziness of the American man. That is why he is so kind and polite in his home and why he can fight so hard in his business. His real life is where his fight is. The lazy part of his life is where his family is. Jung was writing of American men at the turn of the last century. He could as easily have been writing of manhood, career and family life some 80 years later. He certainly could have been writing about mine. Yet, given the nature and extent of the feminist analysis and the sexual revolution of the second half of the twentieth century, much would appear to have changed for - women. But what has happened to men? </p> <p> As a young psychiatrist in the late 1960s and 1970s I regularly encountered the phenomenon then known as the 'empty-nest syndrome'. It afflicted married women who, having given their lives to the rearing of their families, found when they reached their fifties that their children had grown up and gone and their spouses were off living a life of work and golf. Now, in the 1990s, I don't see so many women from empty nests. Rather I see middle-aged men, who gave their lives loyally to this company or that corporation, who sacrificed everything for it, now ruthlessly put out to grass, compulsorily retired, downsized, rendered redundant. Bewildered, they look around but their children have flown and their spouses are otherwise occupied. It is the women who now play the golf, who have jobs and friends at work. It is the men who cower in the empty nest, nervously facing what an eloquent Irish businessman friend has termed 'the forgotten future'. </p> <p> From the outset of public life as a male - at school, university, medical school, debating union, postgraduate research centre, hospital - I learned to compete and pretend to a confidence I didn't often (didn't ever) feel. That is what men are required to do. As a result, one of the commonest fears of mature men is that they will be 'found out' in some mysterious fashion. As a young father, I shouted at my children in order to feel powerful, and covertly and sometimes overtly declared that manly boys didn't complain but had to be strong and responsible and suppress vulnerability, particularly if they were to avoid being bullied by other boys. As a young husband, I loved my wife and was, or so I believed, a sympathetic and liberated 'new' male. Now I am not so sure. She sacrificed much to be a committed and full-time mother. I sacrificed little to be a peripheral and very part-time dad. But I was the family provider and that counted for a great deal - to me at any rate - and I was a father to my children, even if I would have been hard put to define precisely what being a father was. </p> <p> Now, the whole issue of men - the point of them, their purpose, their value, their justification - is a matter for public debate. Serious commentators declare that men are redundant, that women do not need them and children would be better off without them. At the beginning of the twenty-first century it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that men are in serious trouble. Throughout the world, developed and developing, antisocial behaviour is essentially male. Violence, sexual abuse of children, illicit drug use, alcohol misuse, gambling all are overwhelmingly male activities. The courts and prisons bulge with men. When it comes to aggression, delinquent behaviour, risk taking and social mayhem, men win gold. </p> <p> And yet, for all their behaving badly, they do not seem any the happier. Throughout North America, Europe and Australia, male suicides outnumber female by a factor of between 3 and 4 to 1. The rise in the number of young men killing themselves in much of the developed world has been rightly termed an epidemic. For the old, the situation is no better. For every 6 elderly women in every 100,000 who kill themselves each year, 40 elderly men take their own lives. And these suicide figures are viewed as the tip of an iceberg of male depression, an iceberg hidden only because men are seen to be either too proud or too emotionally constipated to admit when their feelings are out of control. Men renowned for their ability and inclination to be stoned, drunk or sexually daring, appear terrified by the prospect of revealing that they can be - and often are - depressed, dependent, in need of help. </p> <p> It will be said that it has always been thus and that all that is changing is that men are coming out of the emotional closet. Men, so this argument goes, having ridiculed, demeaned and patronised women's supposed emotionality, now accept the importance, the maturity, of not merely acknowledging feelings but expressing them in a civilised and open way. </p> <p> Others argue that there is a genuine rise in male dissatisfaction for which there is no shortage of suggested causes. Top of the list is the growing assertiveness of women. As a consequence of the feminist revolution, so this argument goes, women are no longer prepared to be the property of patriarchal men. In this feminist revolution, male power is being overthrown. Men, like colonists seeing their empire crumble, don't like what is happening. Few women have much time for such an argument. After all, the gains that have accrued to women remain pretty miserly. Men still outnumber women in positions of power across the globe, still glower downwards through the glass ceiling, still strut the cabinet and boardrooms in every developed country in the world, the seeming masters of their fate and everybody else's. In the developing world the situation is even more unequal. The gender disparity in sharing the burden of unpaid work is stark, and for all the talk of equality women throughout the world continue to work longer hours than men and are paid very much less for it. The colonists are still in command. </p> <p> In the circumstances, female impatience with male sensitivities is understandable. But it may be missing the point. It is true that patriarchy has not been overthrown. But its justification is in disarray. The colonists have not been displaced but the colonised are planning, discussing, organising, and, in a number of small, well-planned uprisings, have demonstrated their capability. There is a sense, certainly in the outlying areas of the patriarchal empire, that the time for male authority, dominance and control is up. Beneath the surface, male power is being subverted. Throughout Europe - in primary schools, through secondary education and right into the universities - girls are outperforming boys. In the European Union, 20 per cent more women are graduating than men. On leaving school and university, women's prospects of employment exceed men's. In Germany, for example, between 1991 and 1995 twice as many men as women lost their jobs. Women actually gained 210,000 jobs while men lost 400,000. Some teenage boys reassure themselves that later on, in their twenties and thirties, the right order reasserts itself, and men regain their rightful place - on top. But that reassurance, for a variety of reasons, is sounding increasingly hollow. Women are on the march and, even if they still have a long way to go, many men, already threatened, are reacting with aggression directed at women and at themselves. </p> <p> And if changes in education, training and work are not sufficient to demoralise the average man, there is the sorry, dismal, public soap opera of man's relationship with his penis. Men, who in most other areas of their lives make such a fetish of being in control, seem unable to remain masters of their sexual appetites. More darkly, there is little respite from exposure to the more savage side of male sexuality - rape, molestation, sexual violence - manifested overwhelmingly in aggression by men against women and children. Not surprisingly, many innocent men, like the relatives of torturers and killers, find themselves apologising for crimes they have not themselves committed. </p> <p> But are men fearful of their feelings and, if they are, have they good reason to be? Do men feel contempt for women and, if they do, what is fuelling such contempt? It has been argued that misogyny, the hatred of women, is an inescapable element in the development of men and that, quite simply, there are no good men. Might the fear and contempt be related to a deeper fear, a more profound anxiety about male sexuality itself? Here one is treading on dangerous ground. Put a foot wrong and one risks being accused of blaming women for men's inability to control their sexual feelings and to harness their aggression. That is what many men believe and some act upon it. Women are feared, despised and sometimes even destroyed because of what men perceive women to be doing to them. To such men, their own sexuality is exciting precisely because it is unpredictable, capricious, dangerous - and women end up being blamed for provoking it. To such men, women, by their very presence, represent a most disturbing challenge to self-control. Given the extent to which control is for many men the defining mark of their masculinity, any suggestion or threat of being out of control challenges the very essence of what being a male is all about. Bill Clinton's sexual behaviour revealed that the Garden of Eden myth is alive and well and flourishing in the heart of the American empire. Men fall because women tempt them. This remains the explanation of male sexual behaviour most favoured by men. Rather than expose to a genuinely rigorous analysis the nature of male sexuality and its relationship to power, social status, aggression and control, most male commentators retreat into a self-pitying and ultimately depressing moan about the difficulty of being a full-bloodedly sexual man in a dynamic relationship with a woman in the new post-feminist world of gender equality. </p> <p> In an interview with Germaine Greer in 1989 I wondered whether she accepted that behind the bluster and the posturing many men were not really as confident as they might appear. 'I don't care much about phallic insecurity', she tartly replied, adding that, after all, men created the dream of the phallus. It's men who are worried about whether the phallic department is adequate. The women are perfectly happy with all the other stuff - with social status, power, intelligence. She is absolutely right. Men do remain preoccupied with 'whether the phallic department is adequate'. They worry about the size, shape and erectile potential of their genitalia. Men, young and old, are disconcerted by mocking references to what Sylvia Plath dismissively referred to as 'old turkey neck and gizzards'. The highly successful British film, The Full Monty, explicitly drew an analogy between male inadequacy consequent on the loss of a job and male anxiety concerning genital potency. Men must bond, share, emotionally relate, must reveal themselves in full nakedness to each other and to women if they are to be fully human; so went the movie's message. Then came the ultimate copout in which everything was indeed revealed to the cinema audience - save 'old turkey neck and gizzards'! </p> <p> Male preoccupation with their penises would appear to be based on fear, right enough: not on the Freudian fear of castration, but on the Adlerian fear of ridicule. Are we up to it? ask today's men anxiously, peering at their shrivelled cocks and analysing their social skills; are we up to competing, succeeding, achieving, conquering, controlling, asserting, pontificating, as well as getting it up? And there is of course the unavoidable gender inequality, the fact that, unlike the female orgasm, the male erection cannot be faked. The obvious visibility of the male genital organs, their state and size, roused and flaccid, are readily measurable and comparable. Hardly surprising, therefore, that the arrival of Viagra has been accompanied not merely by dodgy humour and gruesome double entendres but also by po-faced and panicky political discussions about the possible bankrupting of health finances due to a stampede by men to get their hands on the latest 'old turkey gizzard' stimulant. </p> <p> The one biological difference between the sexes on which everybody is agreed is that whereas women possess two X-shaped sex chromosomes, men possess one X and a little Y-shaped chromosome. The Y chromosome accounts for superior male strength, stature, mass of muscle, sleight of hand, speed of foot. These attributes have been of considerable value in a world dominated by a need for physical power and energy and a raw, brutal, martial strength. We have become accustomed to thinking of 'real' men as those who labour in the iron, steel and coal industries, in shipbuilding, lumberjacking, pre-mechanised farming. Our martial heroes have been almost entirely male, in the fantasies and the realities of hand-to-hand combat, of sheer physical guts, the will to survive, athletic derring-do. What price all that brute strength, might and energy now, when more people are employed making Indian curries than mining coal, when computerised robots and not sweating men assemble cars and when the male predilection for violence, far from saving national pride, threatens world survival? </p> <p> There is hardly anything to be done in today's society that cannot be done by women. 'So what!' say women, not unreasonably, given the age it has taken to establish such a state of affairs. So what, indeed. The problem is one for men and particularly for those men - and they have been the majority - who have defined their lives, their identities, the very essence of their masculinity in terms of professional and occupational achievement and have prided themselves on the work that only they as men could do. My father's generation prided themselves on being providers - for their spouses, families and themselves. Today, providing seems no longer required. Married women increasingly reap the benefit of education, harness their intelligence and generate their own incomes. In one-parent families women press hard for workplace creches and better childcare facilities, as well as social security payments to compensate for male-generated finances. Not merely is the role of provider under siege, the role of father is threatened. The second millennium has ended with man's claim to a significant role in procreation and child-rearing seriously diminished. The rise in the number of single mothers suggests not merely that men are inadequate as partners and fathers but that they are simply redundant. Women are asserting that they can conceive and rear children on their own. They don't need men to father their children. The development of assisted reproduction, including techniques such as in vitro fertilisation, artificial insemination by anonymous donor and surrogate motherhood, together with the highly political and controversial assertion that single parenting is as good as that provided by two parents, raise the question - whither fatherhood? If conception, pregnancy, delivery and child-rearing can be perfectly well accomplished without the active participation of the male, then why bother with him at all, given the heartache, the trouble, the sheer cussedness of today's man? Once so proud of his penis (Freud, after all, argued that women envied it), contemporary man now finds he is being reduced to the role of support seed carrier, as women occupy centre stage not merely in the creation of new life (they have always been there) but in its nurturing. It is hardly surprising that there are some men who seriously suggest that the only way they can again play a reproductive and parental role of any significance is if they can be assisted by science to have babies themselves! </p> <p> A century ago, a peevish Sigmund Freud, perplexed by a seeming epidemic of hysterical, depressed, lethargic and dissatisfied women, asked, 'What do women want?' He asked it at a time when to be a woman was to be pathological, to be male was to be health personified. A century later it is not women who are seen to be pathological, but men; it is not women's wants, but men's, that mystify us. But before we can begin to answer what men want, deserve or need, it is necessary to reassess what we know about men. What is it that the Y chromosome, the cause of all the trouble, is up to? Are men innately and incorrigibly violent? Must the issue between the sexes be for men a case of dominate or be dominated, for women a choice between being resistant or submissive? In a world of equal opportunity for the sexes, can men renegotiate the relationship with themselves and with women? Is there anything left of the male role as provider and protector? Do we need men? Do we need fathers? And if we do, what kind of men, what kind of fathers do we need? </p> <p> The contemporary world is still, for the most part, divided into two spheres - the private sphere, inhabited for the most part by women, and a public sphere where men find and cultivate their identity and assert their dominance. The power of patriarchy, that set of relations of power that enable men to control women, is grounded in the belief that the public takes precedence over the private. Women struggling to escape the constraints of patriarchy are drawn into a tacit acceptance of the superior value of the public, the business, the profession and the office, and a devaluation of the private. Men, as a consequence, feel little need to reassess the priority they give to the public; indeed, the very desire of women to establish their own public legitimacy is interpreted as further proof that the public is indeed superior and the private is legitimately regarded as inferior. </p> <p> In exploring the challenged state of masculinity in this book, I have chosen the term 'phallus' very deliberately. The penis is an anatomical term referring to the male generative organ. The phallus is an anthropological and theological term referring to its image. The penis is an organ with biological functions, the phallus is an idea venerated in various religions as a symbol of male power. Phallic refers not merely to the penis but incorporates notions of potency, virility, manliness, strength and power. It has been seen as the 'signifier of signifiers', the mark which positions the individual as male and locates him in terms of authority, control, dominance'. The phallus 'signifies what men think they have and what women are believed to lack'. Man's penis is not at issue, except for its possible redundancy as a tool of procreation. But phallic man, authoritative, dominant, assertive - man in control not merely of himself but of woman - is starting to die, and now the question is whether a new man will emerge phoenix-like in his place or whether man himself will become largely redundant.</p>",
  "Let me say first of all: it is because since 1997 we have put our Labour values and our priorities into action that Britain has greater economic stability, rising investment in health, education and our public services, a national minimum wage for the first time, and the lowest unemployment for a generation. <p> And here in Brighton today, again speaking the language of priorities, I want to discuss with this conference and, from this conference, to discuss with the British people the economic challenges our country still faces. The difficulties we must still surmount, the new world pressures we now have to tackle and the long term choices we as a country have to make on the future of our economy, the future of public spending, the future of pensions and the future of taxes</p> <p> Choices that we must make by heeding the call of principle and hearing the voices of the people as we listen and, as is our ambition and duty, to put ourselves at the service of the hard working people of Britain.</p> <p> And I want the message to go out from Brighton this afternoon that if we, the Labour party, make the case for our values; and if by our service we show the British people we are worthy of trust then we can aim higher, and in our time and generation build a Britain of full employment. One where there is educational opportunity for all. A Britain where we abolish child and pensioner poverty, create a safe environment for all our children and show that the best health service for each of us is a national health service run for all of us.</p> <p> A Britain where, true to our values, not just a few people but everyone has the chance to fulfil their potential and share in national prosperity.</p> <p> In 1997 we said that the future depended upon first building strong and long term foundations for economic stability.</p> <p> We all remember the early 90s.</p> <p> It was Britain's hard working families -the one million who lost jobs in manufacturing, the one million businesses that went under, the million homeowners with negative equity. It was hard working families who paid the price and bore the brunt of economic failure. And by 1997 with the deficit nearly 30 billion, the national debt doubled, debt payments bigger than the schools budget, inflation rising, and the economy on the way back to the old familiar cycle of boom and bust, we resolved to, and under Tony Blair had the strength to, take difficult long term decisions</p> <p> Bank of England independence. Tough controls on public spending. The difficult decision to raise fuel taxes. The decision to pay back debt and cut the costs of debt.</p> <p> Breaking from the chronic and flawed Conservative short-termism and implementing Labour values; planning for the long-term; economic responsibility; building from strong foundations. Determined to protect hard working families from a return to boom and bust.</p> <p> So it is not by accident, but by our actions, that we now have the lowest inflation for over 30 years and around the lowest long term interest rates for 35 years, and a mortgage bill on average \u00a31,000 lower than under Tory interest rates.</p> <p> And it is not by default but by design that unemployment among men is the lowest since 1980, unemployment among women the lowest since 1976, long term unemployment now the lowest since the 1970s, youth unemployment now the lowest since 1975. For the first time in years, unemployment among single parents and the disabled is now falling, as we make the right to work a reality. And I am determined that no one is excluded.</p> <p> And because we have cut the costs of unemployment and debt, it is not by coincidence, but by choice that we are now tackling the long-term neglect of under investment in Britain and spending on health is rising by 7 per cent, education this year by 10 per cent and public investment in Britain is rising this year by 30 per cent, years of Tory underinvestment now replaced by a Labour plan for sustained long term investment.</p> <p> These things did not just happen. The priorities and tough decisions of a Labour government made them happen.</p> <p> And it is precisely because we have taken the time and trouble to build the long term foundation for success, precisely because we have resisted short term lurches in policy, that we can today steer a course of stability at a time of uncertainty in the world economy without putting growth at risk.</p> <p> So we will not return to the old short-termism.</p> <p> There will be no sudden lurches in tax or spending policy.</p> <p> And there will be no irresponsible pre-election sprees or pay demands that put youth jobs or any jobs at risk. No change in our policy on Europe, support in principle for the single currency, in practise the five tests that have to be met. And no relaxing our fiscal rules.</p> <p> We will not put hard won economic stability at risk. No return to short-termism. No return to Tory boom and bust.</p> <p> Now, the Tories used to say a Labour government meant recession and unemployment but now Mr Portillo is pushing a new argument: to accept there is economic stability and growth but then to say this is nothing to do with the government. </p> <p> I ask Mr Portillo and these Tories: if economic stability was so simple to achieve, why did the Tory party give Britain twenty years of stop-go, twenty years of boom and bust? It is Labour that is now the party for stability and growth.</p> <p> If falling unemployment was so simple to achieve, why did their policies give us three million unemployed and why was it never below today's level on any single day in two decades of Conservative government?</p> <p> And if prudence in public finances is so simple, why did the Tories land us with a 50 billion deficit, the worst in our history and double the nation debt?</p> <p> These things didn't just happen. The flawed values of a Tory government made them happen.</p> <p> And amidst their mismanagement when all these mistakes were being made is it nor right that we ask where was Mr Portillo?</p> <p> When it came to imposing VAT on fuel, is it not right that all of us ask, where was Portillo?</p> <p> I'll tell you. At the treasury, imposing VAT on fuel.</p> <p> When it came to imposing twenty-two Tory tax rises, is it not right that we all ask, where was Mr Portillo?</p> <p> At the treasury, imposing twenty-two Tory tax rises.</p> <p> When it came to imposing the poll tax, is it not right that we all ask where was Mr Portillo?</p> <p> I'll tell you. A local government minister imposing the poll tax.</p> <p> When it came to the biggest ever cuts in public spending and public services, it is right that we ask where was Mr Portillo?</p> <p> At the treasury imposing cuts in public services.</p> <p> But our duty to the people of Britain is greater than avoiding Tory boom and bust, or even achieving stability for a year or two.</p> <p> So we will stick with our long-term task - to build for the first time in a generation in Britain a culture that, by entrenching low inflation and long term stability, builds prosperity for homeowners, small businesses and all those in work and in need of work.</p> <p> It is because we understand the difficulties that the weak Euro and strong pound has caused for manufacturers and exporters that we have introduced new tax incentives for manufacturers and exporters, and in every pre-budget report we look carefully at the needs of manufacturers and business.</p> <p> And I say to all who want to avoid a return to economic instability, even when events like rising oil prices and unstable exchange rates challenge us, we will do everything we can with our international partners to promote stability.</p> <p> A 300 per cent rise in oil price in 18 months cannot be justified and I understand the difficulties it is causing for motorists, business and consumers in Britain as it is in every continent of the world.</p> <p> That is why when I was in Prague, we fought for and secured an agreement from all countries, oil producers and oil consumers, that oil production had to increase and that oil prices had to come down.</p> <p> And I will report further on this and other issues in my pre-budget report and in the budget.</p> <p> And just as we have had the strength to make hard long term choices based on Labour values to build stability and growth, so too we have put in place a long term employment policy based on difficult choices, not just about the right to work but the responsibility to work. And we made the hard decisions the Tories would never make - to charge a windfall tax on the utilities, so that some of the richest companies helped the poorest communities.</p> <p> All my life I have seen in the town I grew up in, and in the constituency I serve, unemployment scar the lives of far too many people.</p> <p> In these years the unemployed people I met did not lack talent, did not lack initiative, did not lack the will to work, they lacked a government on their side.</p> <p> That is why in the first days in government David Blunkett, Andrew Smith and I went out and talked to young unemployed men and women about a new deal. I knew then our challenge was to prove to these young people they finally had a government on their side. A government that worked for them.</p> <p> With us today is Lee Ford, aged 23, from Barnsley.</p> <p> Unemployed under the Tories, now in work under Labour.</p> <p> And not just a job, but now with his fianc\u00e9 buying their first home.</p> <p> And we pledge that on behalf of Lee Ford and thousands like him,- what we have built up in the new deal we will never let the Tories destroy.</p> <p> Remember our pledge card, our posters about jobs for young people moving from welfare to work.</p> <p> I can report to this conference that we will next year be able to put on every billboard on the country: 250,000 young people who have moved from welfare to work.</p> <p> And I am now determined that we build not one million jobs but build full employment for our generation.</p> <p> Unemployment in Scotland, Wales, the north and midlands is the lowest for more than twenty years.</p> <p> But we will not rest our efforts as long as there are people and places excluded. With \u00a3500 million for the regional development agencies in every area of Britain, our aim is full employment not just in one region but in every region of the country.</p> <p> But if we are to achieve and sustain full employment, we must together - industry, unions, government, public services - address new world pressures and overcome the old British problems of short-termism and under investment, low productivity, inadequate skills and restrictive practises, wherever they are.</p> <p> Already, to promote enterprise, \u00a31 billion for science. A 10p rate of capital gains tax, a 10p small business tax rate. Employee shares for all, 180 billion for transport.</p> <p> And enterprise open to all. For high unemployment inner cities and regions our pre-budget report will propose new tax cuts allied to spending increases to replace deprivation by enterprise, poverty by employment, neglect by new business.</p> <p> Labour: the party of enterprise.</p> <p> And all the time demonstrating that enterprise is not at the cost of fairness but that enterprise and fairness go together.</p> <p> And because the Tories did not understand that efficiency and justice are not enemies but vital allies in the battle to raise productivity, they wrongly denied workers rights, women's rights, equal rights - and they said a minimum wage would cost a million jobs.</p> <p> Yes, a minimum wage, and yes, a million jobs.</p> <p> Let us tell them - in 3 years with the minimum wage in place we have not destroyed a million jobs, Britain has created one million jobs.</p> <p> And the only jobs the minimum wage cost were those of the Tory MPs who opposed it.</p> <p> And let us pledge here at this conference to work to make sure that these are jobs that are not coming back.</p> <p> And because the evidence now demonstrates that economic efficiency and social justice are not at odds but go hand in hand, I can tell this conference today of a further priority for next year: Steven Byres has asked the low pay commission to report next year on a further rise in the minimum wage as we secure fairness at work.</p> <p> And I give you this pledge as we celebrate 30 years of equal pay legislation, it is now the right time to ensure that in future no woman will have - as in the past -to wait years for their right to equal pay to be realised.</p> <p> And because family friendly employment is good for both employers and employees, there will be new measures for maternity pay and leave, and with new investment, our commitment to high quality accessible and affordable child care, a national childcare strategy for Britain.</p> <p> And never again do we want mothers and fathers refused time off to see their sick children, so the right to time off when a family member is ill. That is what a good family policy is all about.</p> <p> And one of the best family policies of all - the working families tax credit.</p> <p> With us today, Fozia Afzal from Preston, mother of three children. On poverty pay under the Tories. Now, as result of the working families tax credit, \u00a325 a week better off this year alone.</p> <p> The Tories would abolish the working families tax credit. I tell you today we will expand it.</p> <p> Let us pledge for Fozia and one million others we will never let the Tories abolish the credit and push her and one million others back into poverty.</p> <p> In the 1980s and 1990s, thousands of men and women over 50 were thrown on the employment scrapheap. Age discrimination is wrong. Today half a million people over 50 are back in work. And I give you this pledge - we will do all we can to end age discrimination in employment and help older workers back to jobs.</p> <p> Now when we came into power we decided that the right thing to do was to put the poorest pensioners first.</p> <p> And in this parliament we are spending \u00a36 billion more. More than the earnings link, most to those who need it most, most to help lift the poorest pensioners out of poverty</p> <p> It was not wrong to put the abolition of pensioner poverty first.</p> <p> But I know that we have more to do, much more to do.</p> <p> We have to do more not just for the poorest but for millions more, all those pensioners who have yet to share enough in the rising prosperity of the country.</p> <p> We will build upon the basic state pension: the basic state pension is now, and will remain, the foundation of everything we do.</p> <p> We will fight against the Tories' plan to opt out, to break up, to destroy the basic pension.</p> <p> And let me tell this conference today that in the pre-budget report, it will be a priority that we do more, with by 2003 a new pension credit that will get extra help not only to the poorest, but to the millions who have lost out in the rising prosperity of the country.</p> <p> And in the meantime as the statement to this conference which Alistair Darling and I put to the economic policy commission last week, says there will be transitional arrangements to the benefit of all pensioners. And we will publish a detailed plan in the next few weeks.</p> <p> Let me explain the new pension credit. Just as the working families tax credit is getting extra money directly to lower and middle income families, so too our new pension credit will reward saving and get cash directly to millions of lower and middle income pensioners.</p> <p> Each year, more cash than either an inflation rise or an earnings link would provide.</p> <p> More money for retired men and women with small works pensions, more money for widows with modest savings, more for men and women who have worked hard and saved all their lives, but who struggle to get by, and whose cause is our cause.</p> <p> Everybody knows that we are having to tackle extremes of pensioner poverty and also rising pensioner inequality that has demanded new thinking:</p> <p> Today in the year 2000, one in 6 pensioner couples retire on more than 4oo a week</p> <p> Soon that figure will become one in five, and in time, one in four and then one in three.</p> <p> It is a progressive principle that we should do more for those who have the greatest needs.</p> <p> So if we are to plan for the future, our priority cannot be that the wealthiest get exactly the same as the neediest.</p> <p> A flat rate increase will not do enough to help pensioners on modest incomes and do nothing to diminish growing inequalities but instead reinforce them.</p> <p> We will build upon the basic state pension.</p> <p> For the poorest pensioners, we are drawing up plans to raise the minimum income guarantee to \u00a390 a week.</p> <p> And our pension credit will ensure that we reward and do not penalise saving and will ensure that all lower and middle income pensioners will receive extra help, get more than the earnings link, year by year.</p> <p> We will spend more and we will spend more fairly.</p> <p> And I want it to be said of us:</p> <p> This was the generation that had the determination and commitment to abolish pensioner poverty in our country. But not only that, by all our measures taken together, we ensured every pensioner shared in the rising prosperity of the nation.</p> <p> I say to this conference, I want a Britain where what matters is not the privilege you were born to, but the potential you are born with, I want a Britain where what matters is not the school you went to but the skills you are prepared to acquire.</p> <p> It is a Britain where what is valued is not the connections you inherit but the contribution you are prepared to make.</p> <p> What drives us forward, what inspires us to action is not the Britain we are but the Britain we can become, the causes yet unworn, the potential yet unrealised, the vision yet unfulfilled, the future yet to be born.</p> <p> And because these values challenge us to higher efforts, I tell this conference that in the months ahead, the months up to the coming election we will work every day every week to convince the British people that we deserve a new mandate for a purpose: with already 1.2 million children lifted out of poverty, we can aim higher, we will seek a simple and fundamental mandate to eradicate child poverty in our generation. And give every child best possible start in life.</p> <p> So there is a Tory way - tolerating child poverty - and there is a Labour way - ending it.</p> <p> Already there are hundreds of thousands more students in higher and further education, but we can aim higher. We will seek a mandate to enable a majority of young people to go to college or university. And educational opportunity truly for all.</p> <p> So there is a Tory way - education for an elite, and there is a Labour way - lifelong education for all.</p> <p> With the health service now allocated more resources year on year than ever before, we can aim higher for an NHS true to its central founding ideal - that the best NHS for each of us is the health service free at the point of need for all of us in every part of Britain.</p> <p> So there is a Tory way - the road to privatisation and cuts and there is a Labour way - investing in a national service run in the public sectors by the best public servants as a public service, and Labour internationalism, not Tory isolationism is our goal.</p> <p> That is why yesterday in Prague led by Clare Short and by this party we pressed for and agreed a new plan to wipe out the debts of the 20 poorest countries by December this year. And unlock millions of the world's poor from the chains of unpayable debts. But as long as there is poverty suffering and injustice we must never relax our efforts our cause endures - a virtuous circle of debt relief, poverty reduction and economic development that helps all the worlds poor.</p> <p> The abolition of child poverty.</p> <p> An end to pensioner poverty.</p> <p> Full employment.</p> <p> Educational opportunity truly for all.</p> <p> The best health service for each of us.</p> <p> Great causes worthy of our party's ideals.</p> <p> Great causes today shared, I believe, by the British people.</p> <p> An essential foundation for our country's future.</p> <p> Causes that now challenge indeed call us as a party and as a country to action.</p> <p> Causes for which we will work every day to earn a new mandate from the people of Britain.</p> <p> But let no one be in any doubt - to achieve these goals requires the country to make a choice.</p> <p> It is a choice facing us, which goes beyond decisions on any individual tax or spending programme</p> <p> The choice is this.</p> <p> Is our national priority today to build long term stability and invest in hospitals, schools and strong public services for all?</p> <p> Or is it to put both stability and public services at risk by irresponsible tax promises, which if implemented will cut billions from hospitals, schools and our core services?</p> <p> And there should be a great national debate about this choice.</p> <p> When I became shadow chancellor I said to you then, as I say to you now, that we will never tax just for taxation's sake, that spending decisions will never again be made in isolation from how we pay for them, that all spending and tax decisions must have a sound justification in principle, and that we are prepared to make difficult decisions so that Britain can enjoy stability in our public finances and invest in our public services - the hospitals, schools, public transport and the policing the country needs.</p> <p> But it is because this country needs full employment that with the 10p rate, with cuts in employers and employees national insurance, and with the new working families tax credit, we have targeted tax cuts to encourage and reward work.</p> <p> It is because we want to promote investment and savings and encourage and reward entrepreneurs that we have introduced a new 10p small business tax rate, a new tax cut for innovation research and development and cut capital gains tax for long term investment to as low as 10p.</p> <p> It is because we want a tax system that is fair to working families and tackles poverty that we are introducing a new system of family support, which while giving \u00a315 to every child will give \u00a350 a week for the poorest child.</p> <p> It is because we want to safeguard the environment that we have cut pollution through the climate change levy and cut car tax on the 4m least polluting cars and targeted tax incentives on ultra low sulphur diesel.</p> <p> It is right that we target tax cuts on the countries priorities. And in future budgets we will have targeted tax cuts again.</p> <p> But what we rule out is blanket irresponsible tax promises that cut into the \u00a34 billion extra investment in transport, the \u00a312bn in education and training, the \u00a314bn in health, we will not put the long term future of our public services at risk.</p> <p> For however difficult the decisions we have to make, the country will never forgive us if we lurch from one opportunist tax decision to another and retreat to the old short termist ways of the past</p> <p> We will do nothing that puts this country's stability and public services at risk.</p> <p> So I tell you the country does face a choice. And there should now be a great national debate. </p> <p> Not a debate simply conducted in Westminster or Whitehall; this is a debate, the outcome of which will affect every part of this country, and so it must take place in every part of this country.</p> <p> As we debate this choice - and in the annual pre budget consultation - we will listen and we will also make our case.</p> <p> With the farmers and hauliers - and also with the nurses and health service workers, the teachers and public servants, people working in manufacturing service and exporting sectors, and all those who depend upon our public services...all the hard working families of Britain.</p> <p> This national debate is too important to ever be decided by those who shout the loudest or push the hardest. The British way, the Labour way is that every voice must be heard.</p> <p> Friends, they said in one term we could never simultaneously create stability, one million jobs, abolish 800 hereditary peers, create devolution for Scotland and Wales create a minimum wage for Britain and take a million children out of poverty.</p> <p> But we have.</p> <p> Now they will say we cannot achieve our priorities.</p> <p> Full employment. Abolish child and pensioner poverty. Build world class public services. Prosperity for all.</p> <p> I say we can and we will</p>",
  "<p>Want a really daft theory on why Britain has failed to win an Olympic swimming medal for the first time since 1936? It has nothing to do with lack of facilities or training or the rest of the world getting faster. It is all down to television. </p> <p>Many years ago, when cameras were heavy and unwieldy beasts and the most-covered sports were those which lent themselves easily to coverage from fixed points, swimming was a regular fixture on Grandstand (Those were the days when Grandstand had a virtual monopoly of viewers and sports.) It was not exactly riveting Saturday afternoon entertainment, but on cold, rainy days between the live rugby and the football results, it introduced millions of youngsters to the graceful art of competitive swimming. How many were inspired to take it up seriously, entered competitions and formed the pool (so to speak) of talent from which Olympic champions are drawn? And how many fewer have been similarly inspired since swimming gradually faded from the small screen? </p> <p>Show-jumping, too, was a staple diet of peak-time Wednesday evenings. There are many who date Britain's enthusiasm for this sport from its only gold medal of the 1952 games - in front of a growing television audience - soon followed by a dramatic Horse of the Year jump-off watched live by millions. </p> <p>I appreciate that there are flaws in this theory. Television can't really take the credit for our swimming medals in 1948, and television exposure of double trap shooting or canoeing has not been conspicuous over the past few years even on Sky Sports 31 or Eurosport. But even a few minutes of mass audience television coverage can have a dramatic impact on the numbers taking up a sport. A trivial example: the number of affiliated volleyball players increased by 500 per cent in the five years following the start of regular coverage of the sport on BBC and Channel 4 in 1984. In the five years before that, it had risen by 70 per cent. </p> <p>Which brings us to the main issue. Professional sport is big business, and commercial television is even bigger. You can't expect the BSkyBs and Granadas of this world to kick football aside to make way for tiddlywinks. But the vast majority of sports are run by amateurs for amateurs on shoestring budgets, and we still have a significant public service presence in broadcasting which has all but abdicated responsibility for trying to convey some flavour of these obscure pastimes to a wider audience. </p> <p>While the BBC tries to play catch-up with ITV on inflated rights for big events, Channel 4 has carved out its niche with cricket and horse racing. </p> <p>The decline of Channel 4's aspirations in this area is saddest of all. Remember American Football? Channel 4 was single-handedly responsible for bringing to the UK audience not only an intelligible explanation of the rules, but also a real understanding of its visceral role in American popular culture. Ditto sumo wrestling: it is the rituals as much as the sports that are so fascinating. </p> <p>More important, if less memorable, was a series of programmes launched by Channel 4 in the Eighties called Challenge to Sport, which gave previously untelevised sports a chance to demonstrate their appeal through their own eight-minute video. It was clear that some sports would not make an easy transition to the screen: neither orienteering nor archery quite managed to conjure up the drama of a thrilling soccer match. It did, however, give such underexposed activities as tenpin bowling, karate and even tug-of-war a wider audience. And who knows how many karate enthusiasts were spawned by those precious eight minutes? </p> <p>In its first 10 years, there was a vision and a purpose to Channel 4's sports coverage consistent with its statutory duty to innovate and cater for minorities. Today's Channel 4 uses sport to further the channel's image rather than contributing something different or unique to the country's sporting heritage. </p> <p>Television still has a crucial role to play in promoting the myriad number of minority sports which never make it past the ratings-obsessed gatekeepers of terrestrial channels. If Channel 4 and the BBC can rediscover their public service enthusiasm for sport across the board, we may have a few more Olympic medals in 16 years' time. As I write, Britain has just won its first ever medal in badminton. I cannot remember the last time badminton was on telly. I said it was a daft theory.</p>",
  "<p>A penny for your thoughts. Or, depending on your pricing structure, 5p or \u00a35, chargeable per minute and billable to other people's credit cards or phone bills. You're an expert, you see, and all that separates you from customers willing to pay for your specialist knowledge - on finding a reliable builder, perhaps, or overcoming baldness - is a website which allows them to find you. </p> <p>Wait no longer: \"expert exchange\" websites are the latest hot business models heading our way. Drawing on the internet's extraordinary ability to link individuals to their peers, these \"peer-to-peer\" sites do for specialist knowledge what Napster does for music and eBay for car-boot junk. By restoring human guidance to the tricky business of researching information online, they have built strong traffic by finding individuals who can answer other people's questions. Yet there is one question that, even at a premium, these sites cannot yet answer with confidence: will enough people be willing to pay for web-delivered content to make a viable long-term business? </p> <p>There is no shortage of sites trying to find out. <a href=\"http://www.askme.com\" target=\"_NEW\">AskMe.com</a> promises \"great answers from real people\" in categories ranging from pets to the paranormal (currently recruiting experts in the Olympics, MP3 and Rosh Hashanah). <a href=\"http://www.Exp.com\">Exp.com</a> offers \"real experts; real help\" on subjects including US immigration law (advice at $1.10 a minute) and marathon running. </p> <p>Search engines think there's money to be made here: Ask Jeeves was among those which put $33m into Exp.com in a recent funding round. Yahoo has also entered the market, with experts.yahoo.com, featuring such specialists as \"Roumster\", a 25-year-old woman keen to talk about dating problems. The New York Times has its own \"knowledge network\", Abuzz (top questions: what really happened to that Russian sub and whether geraniums work as house plants). <a href=\"http://www.KnowPost.com\">KnowPost.com</a> promises \"meta-knowledge\" on the Wizard of Oz and web-browsing technology. </p> <p>Many of these sites rely on advertising as their business model, others customise their services for corporate customers. But it is the convergence of web and telephony that is currently exciting investors. Two phone-enabled expert exchanges are coming to London, betting on our willingness to pay by the minute to talk to specialists. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.Keen.com\">Keen.com</a>, a San Francisco-based start-up that claims to be \"the live answer community\", has joined with Benchmark Capital in a $15m investment to form Keen Europe. Users will browse its subject listing, choose an expert, and then click on a \"call now\" button - and the site connects both parties by phone, taking a 30% commission on the call fee. Ten months after launch, parent site Keen.com claims 500,000 members, with 1.4m unique monthly visitors. </p> <p>Up against Keen is <a href=\"http://www.Questico.com\">Questico.com</a>, a DM14m (\u00a34m) German start-up founded in April that is soon to launch in the UK. The company claims to combine \"the Internet's advantage of speedy information retrieval with the opportunity to instantly take part in a one-on-one dialogue over the telephone, putting an end to the long and difficult search process one often encounters\". As with most of these sites, users rate the experts once they've bought the advice to ensure some measure of quality control. </p> <p>These sites also benefit from the willingness of users to spend money on the telephone: premium-rate calls, after all, have been among the main money makers for companies such as the 365 Corporation, and relatively high per-minute call charges have not dented the growth of the mobile-phone sector. What is really exciting the investors is the mobile's promise to become the major means of accessing the internet in a year or two. </p> <p>Keen.com's chief executive, Karl Jacob, has a vision for these information exchanges. \"What eBay did for people selling what's in their garages and attics, Keen.com will do for people who want to sell what's in their heads,\" he says. The idea is attractive but what will determine the future of these sites is our willingness in enough numbers to abandon that tenet of web use: the public does not like paying for content. </p> <p>\"Every single site in the world that has tried to charge for content has rejected it - except the Wall Street Journal,\" notes James Ledbetter, newly arrived in London from New York as editor of the Industry Standard Europe. \"The brilliance of Napster is it's free. To introduce that [peer-to-peer exchange] on a paid model is admirable, risky, but I suspect for a lot of people doing it, not ultimately successful.\" </p> <p>I'm not so sure: for very specific information that can be delivered digitally or by phone - tips on a business plan, for instance, or professional advice on a medical problem - customers will be willing to pay a premium. And if you're still not convinced, for \u00a31 a minute I'd be happy to tell you why.</p> <p>\u0095 David Rowan is editor of Guardian Unlimited<br> <a href=\"mailto:david.rowan@theguardian.com\">david.rowan@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>News photographers and photojournalists are increasingly turning to the web in a bid to secure their independence amid growing uncertainty sparked by a wave of controversial takeovers by the picture industry's largest agencies. Concerned by what they see as the beginning of an unprecedented corporate buyout, and taking advantage of the proliferation of cheap, readily available digital technology, an increasing number of photographers are turning freelance to create their own independent online picture agencies.</p> <p>Last year's acquisition of the respected Paris-based Sygma agency by Bill Gates' giant Corbis operation kicked off a scramble among major players to scoop up smaller agencies and led to a degree of dispute between photojournalists and executives seldom seen in the world of news photography. </p> <p>\"What we've been seeing is a calculated drive to buy up the picture market,\" says Neil Burgess, picture editor of Network, one of the UK's few remaining independent outfits. \"The big agencies - Corbis, Getty, Hachette - are each attempting to corner the market and diversify their own collections with the photographs from the smaller, specialist libraries. This way, eventually, they'll be able to undercut on price and offer images of just about anything, all from one place.\"</p> <p>Several well-known Sygma photographers - including Allan Tannenbaum and Andrew Lichtenstein - recently quit over what they describe as unacceptable market domination, poor contracts and representation: \"When Corbis took over [Sygma] there was a feeling they would attempt to restore it to its former glory,\" says Tannenbaum, staff photographer with the agency for almost 20 years. \"Instead they went on a search and destroy mission.\"</p> <p>He argues that far from using its size and influence to negotiate universally higher editorial rates, Corbis may have attempted to drive industry prices down in order to acquire greater market share; and in doing so it adversely affected the interests of photographers and squeezed out smaller, independent agencies. The situation was compounded earlier this month when Hachette Filipacchi Medias of France announced it was to buy the international Katz agency, \"to ward off alternative approaches from US market leaders.\"</p> <p>The defectors from Corbis claim that the big agencies' primary aim is to sell the greatest number of single photos to the greatest number of buyers in the shortest time scale, something not in keeping with the photojournalists' tradition of perfecting picture stories over a longer period of time. </p> <p>\"The photographers and - more importantly - the photographs, are becoming irrelevant. It's about profit and market share,\" one photojournalist \"just hanging on\" with Corbis-Sygma says. \"This is why photographers are taking the risk, getting wired and going it alone.\"</p> <p>\"The industry is in a state of flux,\" says Linda Royles, executive officer of the British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies (BAPLA). \"This is partly attributable to the recent mergers and acquisitions, but also due to the wider effects of digitisation. Many of the UK's [estimated 900] existing picture agencies are having to rethink their approach in light of the new technology, as are those setting up new agencies.\"</p> <p>Recent BAPLA figures illustrate the perceived importance of the web among those operating picture agencies: 70% have an online presence, 30% with fully searchable databases. </p> <p>\"The number of picture agencies launched is increasing, one recent month spawning 14 new outfits,\" says Royles. \"Many are single photographers looking to market their work so they're planning extensive, or at least partial, web presence.\" The photographers' bids for autonomy have been made possible by high street access to increasingly inexpensive technology. </p> <p>\"For as little as the cost of a decent computer, digital camera, scanner and - if you're prepared to do everything yourself - a server and basic software for a searchable database, you can be up and running as a small independent outfit,\" maintains Andrew Wiard, founder of his own <a href=\"http://www.reportphotos.com\">reportphotos.com</a> agency. \"If you've got money to spend, however, there's effectively no upper limit.\"</p> <p>While many freelance photographers use established internet service providers or web companies - Imagenet, for example - specifically geared towards the needs of online picture libraries, others are more creative. Photojournalist Howard Davies launched his own specialist online picture agency, <a href=\"http://www.exileimages.co.uk\">exileimages.co.uk</a>, in July, exploiting little more than a trusty computer and a colleague's web design skills to make available more than 15,000 images. </p> <p>\"I had to commission a database which is unique to the agency, but sales have already covered the [web] design and maintenance costs,\" he says. \"It was a case of utilising this newly available technology to undertake an idea that I'd had for years.\"</p> <p>Davies says the prime motivation for going it alone is control and being able to deal direct with clients. \"I'd become a bit disillusioned with sales from the big agencies, so pulled some stock images out. Now I take 100% rather than negotiate for 50% or 70%.\"</p> <p>Despite the online project he still maintains distribution deals with a couple of big agencies. \"I've not had too rough a deal - they do pay,\" he says but admits fears brought about by the recent string of acquisitions are becoming increasingly visible: \"A young photojournalist approached me to undertake work; when I asked why he'd chosen such a small, specialist agency, he said it would be better not to have to negotiate with the bigger, more traditional outlets - ten years ago that would have been unheard of.\"</p> <p>Such views are echoed by Gary Trotter, founder of Images Sans Frontieres (ISF) - the UK's first reportage agency to launch entirely via the web: \"I've built up a network of about 30 freelances who don't wish to work for major players where the struggle to retain intellectual [property] rights and control becomes harder than obtaining decent shots.\"</p> <p>Despite the apparent success of ISF and Exile, staff at the (decreasing) number of established agencies are sceptical about the long-term viability of freelance projects: \"There's not enough agencies willing to take on photojournalists anyway so it's logical they try to go it alone,\" says Network's Burgess. \"Unfortunately, without a glowing track record, they're likely to disappear - retain their editorial independence certainly, but run the risk of being forced off the market.\"</p> <p>One way round the problem, according to Andrew Wiard, is to identify a unique niche and specialise. \"If you can build up a reputation for covering a particular area - Scotland, for example - then people will come to know you for that and visit your web library before trying other 'one-stop shops'.\" Another answer, he says, is more fundamental. \"It's easy to forget that even with the best technology in the world for presentation and delivery, you have to deliver quality products. You still have to be able to take a decent shot.\"</p>",
  "<p>Cilla Black's Moment of Truth may have died against the BBC's talent show Star for a Night, but ITV hit back this week with its big gun in the Saturday night showbiz war.</p> <p>ITV's karaoke stalwart, Stars in their Eyes, returned for its autumn run at the weekend and helped the commercial broadcaster to its highest weekly share for nearly four months.</p> <p>At 6.9m viewers and a 40% audience share, the 12th series of Stars in their Eyes at 6.55pm easily beat off BBC1's similarly themed amateur talent-fest hosted by ex docu-soap star Jane McDonald (4.5m, 26%). ITV had 37.8% of all viewing in the seven days to Sunday (September 24).</p> <p>Later on Saturday night, the return of Charlie to Casualty drew a healthy 8.4m (40%) from 8.05pm, against Family Misfortunes (7.2m, 36%) and Family Fortunes (6.1m, 29%) on ITV. </p> <p>At 9.30pm, ITV's Lily Live limped off with 4.6m, a 23% share.

Later, Abba tribute band documentary Abba: Bjorn Again drew 1m (6%) from 5.35pm. A whole day of 6% share should make the shareholders happy - particuarly when the whole day was a repeat.</p>",
  "<p><em>Reg May, 77, is the scorer for Cambridge University, the British Universities and Cambridgeshire in the Minor Counties league.</em></p> <p>\"Last winter I went to South Africa with the British Universities. We spent two and a half weeks in Port Elizabeth, which was lovely - but unfortunately they're not going anywhere this year.</p> <p>\"So what I'll mainly be doing is catching up on cricket stats. I have them all on pen and paper but I do check the first-class and minor-counties ones on the internet as well. I've already had to send the Cambridge University non-first-class results to Harriet Monkhouse, the deputy editor at Wisden. </p> <p>\"For the last few winters I've also been going back through the Cambridgeshire Minor Counties records. It all started a few years ago when we were playing Lincolnshire and one of their players was playing in his 100th match. Someone asked me how many matches one of our long-timers had played but I didn't know because I didn't have the records. So now I'm trying to bring everything up to date, with the help of my wife, Diana, of course. She likes cricket, especially when the weather is good and she has a deckchair and a book. Though I'm not sure she watches that much. </p> <p>\"I've got a few health problems at the moment. I've got a form of leukaemia which they were hoping to keep in control but it has flared up again so I've been on a fortnight of steroids. They've actually made me feel a lot better, though I think I'd be disqualified from the Olympics. Next I think it will be another dose of chemotherapy.</p> <p>\"But at least I've got plenty to do - I'm mostly indoors in my study or gardening. But doing statistics is easier than gardening. It is all voluntary though I do get a little honorary fee from Wisden and a copy of the Wisden Almanack. I also do the books for my wife's cousin who runs a golfing business in Bury St Edmunds. </p> <p>\"I've been retired 18 years and it's been a wonderful retirement. I've been scoring for 15 of the 18 years and have got to know all the first-class cricketers and scorers and, apart from Cambridge, have scored at Lord's more times than anywhere else. </p> <p>\"I was a meteorologist before I retired and spent most of my working life with the RAF - including three years in Singapore and two in Bahrain. Then I spent the last few years at the London Weather Centre helping the oil and gas industry. When I started my career they were looking for oil in the North Sea but by the time I retired in November 1982 they had found it and I used to fly out to the production platforms.\"</p> <p><em>Reg May was talking to Tanya Aldred.

  "This is an important week for all of us. The media are saying we are downbeat. Well I\u0092m not downbeat. The Party\u0092s not downbeat, and neither is the Labour government. <p> And why? Because we\u0092re proud of what this Labour overnment has achieved. It has been delivery, delivery, delivery. </p> <p> On May 1st 1997, we won the election on a radical programme for the environment, transport and local government. As the first step, Tony Blair created a new government department, whose very purpose is a better quality of life for the people of this country. And I\u0092ve got an excellent team of ministers who are putting it into action. </p> <p> Conference, all our policies will count for little if they are not delivered centrally, regionally and locally. That is why it\u0092s so important to bring decision-making closer to the people it affects. We have brought devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. And a strategic authority back to London. And we\u0092ve taken steps towards the sort of regional government I have always believed in. All English regions are enjoying greater prosperity. The new Regional Development Agencies have already saved 35,000 jobs. </p> <p> But the Tories want to abolish them. So let\u0092s ask them why they think development agencies are good for Scotland and Wales, but not for the English regions? </p> <p> And let me say this, I\u0092m proud of the work our 10,000 Labour councillors do for their local communities, up and down the country. I want to see the potential of local government liberated. </p> <p> We abolished compulsory competitive tendering. </p> <p> We ended the Tory \u0091capping\u0092 regime. </p> <p> We offered new modern choices in the way councils work, including a directly elected Mayor if local people want it. </p> <p> Of course there are still problems. But local councils are now better funded than ever before. They have new freedoms. And they have more responsibility too. </p> <p> Local government is our partner - no longer 'the enemy within'. </p> <p> That's Labour democracy in action. </p> <p> We\u0092ve given local councils new powers to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of their communities. The environment is central to our quality of life. Under the Tories, Britain became known as 'the dirty man of Europe\u0092. We\u0092ve changed all that. </p> <p> I\u0092m proud of what this government has done for the environment, at home and abroad - cleaning up the air we breathe, the water we drink, our seas, our rivers and beaches \u0096 all far better under Labour. Cutting water leaks by a quarter-saving enough to supply London for a year. Protecting our wildlife and the beauty of Britain\u0092s countryside. </p> <p> But the environment doesn\u0092t just begin at the edge of town. It starts when you step out of the door. </p> <p> That\u0092s why we are improving people's homes, neighbourhoods, public services, how we travel, and how we live. Not just as individuals, but as part of a community. </p> <p> As our Constitution says: We believe that \"by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone\". We believe there is such a thing as society. We believe we do have responsibilities to others. That\u0092s why we\u0092ve set up a \u00a31 billion programme to help pensioners keep their homes warm, including brand new central heating. </p> <p> And we\u0092ve done more. </p> <p> We\u0092ve set a new goal to wipe out fuel poverty by the year 2010, because we in the Labour Party do not believe elderly people should die, just because they can\u0092t afford to keep warm. That's Labour social justice in action. And nowadays we have world responsibilities in a global environment, where pollution respects no national boundaries. </p> <p> The greatest environmental threat facing the world today is climate change. Britain led the way at the historic summit in Kyoto. In November I\u0092ll be going to the next round of talks in the Hague. The scientific evidence is clear. If we don\u0092t cut greenhouse gases, then climate change will cause havoc across the world. </p> <p> In Britain, floods in winter, drought in summer, low-lying areas swamped by the sea. And tropical diseases will spread - right here in Britain. In Britain. But in Bangladesh, millions of people face devastation from floods. Africa will be stricken by drought and famine. Small islands submerged forever. Ice caps melting. Already in America we see violent storms and the return of the dust bowls. </p> <p> All this and more will plague our world environment, unless industrialised countries stop poisoning the atmosphere. There\u0092s too much talk about the pain, not the gain, when it comes to our environment. Wasting less energy makes industry more competitive. Properly insulated homes are easier to warm. And cleaner cars cut our fuel bills. </p> <p> I know people want cheaper petrol. We hear them loud and clear. But we also hear people when they say they want cleaner air, a better environment. We hear people say they want money spent on schools and hospitals, not to mention farm subsidies, and relief for road haulage. </p> <p> Yes, of course there are real problems. Yes, of course we will listen. Yes, of course we do act. But we will deal with those problems through proper democratic representations in the budget process. </p> <p> And one thing is clear. </p> <p> No government, no prime minister, no chancellor can simply chop and change taxes by the month, Or renegotiate them at a refinery gate, under threat of 60 days notice. That is no way to make decisions in a democratic country. </p> <p> Some of the press might think so. But they sang a different tune when it came to the French blockades, and one or two legal industrial disputes I could mention. So you have to find the right balance in government (and as a nation) which is never easy. But who said politics was easy? </p> <p> I knew when I took this job, that it would take time to transform our transport, after decades of stop-go funding. </p> <p> As a former seafarer, I\u0092m proud that - while the Tories devastated our merchant fleet \u0096 now, under Labour, ships are coming back to the British Red Ensign flag - over a million tonnes so far. </p> <p> Across transport, we\u0092re providing new resources, new powers, new means of delivery \u0096 perhaps most crucially the Strategic Rail Authority, which will ensure private rail firms act in the public interest. </p> <p> </p> <p> The Policy Commission document is full of good ideas on transport and the whole range of issues, on which I\u0092m sure we\u0092ll all agree. And let me congratulate all those involved in the difficult and detailed work, which will give us a new framework for future policy. </p> <p> But let me deal with a point of disagreement on train protection. </p> <p> Let's be clear about this. On the road, on rail, in the air and at sea, safety always comes first in my priorities. One of the main reasons I came into politics was to make shipping safer. Earlier this year I set out a strategy to reduce deaths on the roads by 40%, and by 50% for children. </p> <p> And remember how the Tories ignored \u0096 for 8 years \u0096 pleas for a public inquiry after the sinking of the Thames boat the Marchioness, where 51 people died, causing so much suffering for their families? We restored some form of justice to those grieving families, and not before time. </p> <p> I wasted no time in calling public inquiries after the Southall and Paddington tragedies. After talking to the relatives and walking amongst the wreckage, I was determined they must mark a watershed in rail safety. </p> <p> That\u0092s why I appointed Lord Cullen \u0096 the man who transformed safety in the North Sea \u0096 to head a public inquiry covering the whole safety regime on the railways. We have taken over 30 separate measures to improve rail safety since coming to office, ranging from better driver training to safer rail carriages. </p> <p> Already the number of trains passing red signals has been cut by a quarter in one year. </p> <p> We took advice from Britain's most respected engineer, Sir David Davies. His recommendation was clear. He said install Automatic Train Protection on faster lines, and we\u0092re doing it. But install the Train Protection Warning System across the whole network first, and we\u0092re doing that too. </p> <p> Why? Because this can save more lives than alternative systems which would take ten years to install. That is the sort of difficult decision we face - save lives now or wait for better technology in ten years. </p> <p> Nevertheless I have asked Lord Cullen, together with the chairman of the Southall inquiry, to make specific recommendations on this very question. His public inquiry on this point started last week. But everyone \u0096 relatives, trade unions, lawyers and safety experts - has urged me not to do anything that would pre-empt Lord Cullen\u0092s inquiry. I agree. </p> <p> And I recommend to conference that you do the same and reject the alternative wording that would pre-empt Lord Cullen \u0096 as the National Policy Forum agreed at Exeter in July. </p> <p> Conference must understand that I have given my word that I stand ready to implement whatever is required as a result of Lord Cullen\u0092s proposals, and I will stand by that. </p> <p> </p> <p> But for most people, it\u0092s the daily business of travelling by road and rail that dominates. Our ten-year plan represents the biggest long-term investment in transport this country has ever seen. 180 billion pounds over ten years. In the next three years alone, public investment on transport will rise from \u00a35 billion to a record \u00a39 billion a year. </p> <p> But this is a joint effort between the public and private sectors. In public and private partnership. So, in railways, we\u0092ll see more invested in the next ten years than we saw in the last one hundred years. New track. New trains. New signalling. New services. New stations. </p> <p> More priority for buses in towns and more bus links in rural areas. More \u0091supertrams\u0092 and safer walking and cycling. </p> <p> On our roads, we will tackle the major bottlenecks. We can get more capacity out of the existing road network, but we recognise you can\u0092t simply build your way of congestion. </p> <p> It\u0092s all about balance. Through this and better public transport, we will actually reduce congestion below current levels. And the ten-year plan is not just about figures. It will roll out into real improvements in the years to come. Here are a few examples. </p> <p> This year, the SRA has negotiated the first new rail franchises with more guaranteed investment and better services. By 2001, we\u0092ll start 12 major road improvements. By 2002 half the country\u0092s rail fleet will be new or refurbished, the first phase of the West Coast Mainline will reduce journey times between London and Manchester or Preston to under two hours and the first phase of the channel tunnel rail link will be built and the second phase to St Pancras will begin. </p> <p> In 2003 we will finish 100 safety and congestion improvements to our trunk roads and complete the Nottingham Express transit. In 2004 two hundred more motorway cameras to help traffic flow and reduce congestion. In 2006 all three new Manchester Metrolink lines will be completed. In 2007 widening on motorway bottlenecks will begin. By 2008 we\u0092ve agreed with manufacturers that new cars will do 25% more miles to the gallon. By 2009 the East Coast mainline railway will be upgraded. In 2010 we will see 50% more passengers on trains and 80% more on rail freight. </p> <p> And the benefits will affect every corner of the country. </p> <p> That\u0092s integration in action. Not only better transport links, but integrated thinking that will make life better in our towns and cities. </p> <p> Many of you know from bitter experience, the Tories ripped the heart out of our cities. As the Rogers report, that I commissioned makes clear, this calls for nothing less than an 'urban renaissance'. As he said: \u0091 Cities make citizens and citizens make cities\u0092. How true. That means not just better housing, planning and design, but better jobs, transport, schools, policing and health. Because the quality of life is not contradictory to economic growth; it\u0092s critical to economic growth. If the local school is failing, or the streets are dirty and dangerous, people start to move away. Businesses and investment follow, leaving behind a cycle of poverty and rising crime. </p> <p> We need to think creatively. </p> <p> For example, our universities should not be ivory towers. They should be a resource for their communities, helping to bring skills, jobs and growth. We need social investment. We have released over \u00a35bn of capital receipts to renovate 2 million homes. We need imagination. We are preparing a new Starter Home Scheme to help key workers like nurses and teachers set up home in high cost areas. </p> <p> And for our coalfield communities, destroyed by the prejudice of theThatcher regime, we produced a \u00a3350m package, bringing jobs and hope where the Tories brought the dole and despair. </p> <p> That\u0092s a matter of honour, that we have delivered. </p> <p> And remember this, the greater the exodus from the towns, the greater the strain on the countryside. The Tories want to drive a wedge between the town and the country. We want a living, working countryside. </p> <p> I see the Countryside Alliance are outside to celebrate our hundredth birthday. They are very kind - they came to celebrate my 30th year as an MP for Hull. But I ask the protesters outside the Hall, when the Tories were shutting 2,000 post offices, selling off 10,000 council houses, ending bus services and closing village schools \u0096 why weren't you outside Tory Party conferences protesting for those 18 years? </p> <p> But I tell you this, every time I see the Countryside Alliance I redouble my determination to vote in the House of Commons to abolish fox hunting forever. </p> <p> And I reject claims that people who oppose fox hunting are out of sympathy with rural Britain. From the day my school took me as a boy to the Lake District, I have always loved the countryside. It was Labour, just over 50 years ago, that gave Britain its first national parks. Last year, I announced two new national parks in the South Downs and the New Forest - a great gift to the British people \u0096 especially on our 100th birthday. And we I\u0092ve introduced legislation to extend the right to roam in open countryside. </p> <p> Some of the Tories in the House of Lords don't like it. They think they know all about the open countryside. After all, they own most of it. </p> <p> But I say to members of the House of Lords, this is Government policy and we fully intend to implement it. </p> <p> We believe our natural heritage is not just for the privileged few, but for the whole of our people to respect and enjoy. That's Labour freedom in action. </p> <p> Now Conference, earlier I talked about transport safety. But a life lost in a factory accident is just as important as a life lost in a traffic accident. Labour\u0092s Health and Safety at Work Act has helped reduce accidents dramatically since the 1970s. But in some industries, like construction, lives are being lost through sheer bad working practices, and a degree of indifference. </p> <p> And I\u0092ve warned the construction industry this is totally unacceptable. </p> <p> So we are shaking up health and safety. Company directors must take responsibility for safety. Penalties will be tougher. And we\u0092ve begun consultation on the offence of corporate killing. </p> <p> Company directors whose negligence costs lives must not be allowed to hide behind workers and get away 'scot free'. So, once Lord Cullen has reported on rail, we\u0092ll take decisive action to strengthen our safety law, in transport and in the workplace. </p> <p> For the first time in 25 years, we will bring forward a new wide-ranging Act of Parliament to make Britain a safer place to travel and a safer place to work in. That's Labour caring for our people. </p> <p> So Conference, we have already begun our task: to clean up Britain. To bring new life to our cities and countryside. And to give Britain a transport system we can once again be proud of. </p> <p> We have laid the foundations. But there is still a lot to do. </p> <p> Our Policy Commission has proposed an exciting programme of work. </p> <p> Now we need to get out campaigning to win that second term, to put those ideas into practice. And if you want a good example of integrated thinking - here\u0092s one: </p> <p> From next April, we\u0092ll introduce half price concessionary bus fares for all pensioners, wherever they live, England or Wales, under Tory, Liberal or Labour councils. </p> <p> And whereas some councils charge as much as \u00a340 for the pass we will insist the pass is provided free of charge. In a few weeks we\u0092ll amend our legislation to extend this scheme to disabled people as well for the first time. </p> <p> That's Labour social justice in action. That\u0092s Labour helping the environment. That's Labour backing public transport. </p> <p> But we don\u0092t get those sort of benefits without taking the hard decisions which make it possible. With Tony Blair as Prime Minister, committed to long term decisions, and Gordon Brown as Chancellor sorting out the public finances and stabilising the economy, that\u0092s how we\u0092ve been able to plan for this major improvement in public services. And I would like to record my appreciation and support for what they have achieved. </p> <p> Too often in the past, politicians have dodged long-term responsibility for the sake of short-term expediency. I\u0092ve always been a bit of a conviction politician. I will always do what I believe is right. Sometimes I get attacked for it. </p> <p> So be it. </p> <p> Because when I decide policies, I decide them not for tomorrow's headlines, but for tomorrow's children. </p> <p> And that's the way I\u0092ll always be. </p> <p> And that\u0092s how this Labour government will be. </p>",
  "Scott McManus describes himself as the average student. He is about to start a BA in film studies at Manchester Metropolitan University. Everything he wears is black, except his German army jacket. He dyed his hair black for the start of term and likes night life. <p>But his education about life has started early - Mr McManus, 22, has been robbed three times since the start of freshers' week. </p> <p>\"I've lost \u00a3500 since the beginning of term. The first time they took my walkman and some cash, the second time they took my bank card. They don't usually go for my mobile phone, but in the last attack they did. It tends to happen on Portland Street, just behind the gay village. I have also been done over during the day, by lads under 18 jumping out of cars at traffic lights.\" </p> <p>Last academic year, Mr McManus, who is 6ft 4in and from Manchester, was robbed five times. He said the average age of his attackers was 16. </p> <p>\"Once I was coming home on the bus drunk and I got off at my stop in a bit of a daze and I found myself up against the bus shelter with a knife to my throat. </p> <p>\"Nobody has pulled a gun on me yet, but most of my friends have been held up at gunpoint at cash machines.\" </p> <p>Mr McManus said he had not provoked the attacks and believes any student with a pierced chin or hair in bunches had the equivalent of a target painted on their backs. \"Thieves see students and pounce.\" </p> <p>In Manchester, last year, there were 1,000 street robberies in a two and a half mile radius of the universities. The National Union of Students says there has been a rise in the number of students targeted by petty criminals, and students now represent one of the highest victim brackets in the UK. </p> <p>Rachel Kashman, vice president of NUS welfare, said: \"We have a growing problem and if funding for universities is cut, unions will not be able to finance the security measures in place to help students escape the cycle of mugging.\" </p> <p>Almost one third of street robberies in Manchester are committed against students, according to police. This month, Greater Manchester police received \u00a33.2m in government funding for Operation Hawk, a project to fight street robbery. Police officers handed out leaflets near student unions offering advice on \"How to go out in Manchester without getting the tripe beaten out of you\". Officers patrolled student areas with cameras to photograph suspects as an extension of the stop and search tactic. Students were advised to reduce cash card limits to \u00a350, so thieves could only withdraw the minimum amount of cash. </p> <p>Superintendent Andrew Holt said the problem was not unique to Manchester. \"With four universities and one of the biggest student populations in the country, we illustrate problems other forces are finding in Merseyside, London and the West Midlands.\" </p> <p>In Cambridge, police have invested \u00a334,800 this year in tackling the problem through security staff and deterrents like warning stickers. PC Anil Soni said 75% of offenders who burgled student accommodation were under 30, and so blended in with the community. </p> <p>Cambridge police were also working to reduce street attacks on foreign students. West Yorkshire police launched an offensive last week to reduce crime against students in Leeds; and Leicester has launched a \u00a330,000 burglary reduction project in collaboration with the university. </p> <p>In Manchester, police have produced a profile of student victims. Most are white males between 19 and 24, who own mobile phones or bicycles. Mobile phone thefts on the streets have risen by 9% since last year, but cash card holders are the main targets. </p> <p>\"Female students are also targeted but they tend to take precautions against sexual violence that also prevent them being robbed, \" Superintendent Holt said. </p> <p>Offenders who attack students tended to be young men, aged between 18 and 20, according to the police. Their numbers were rising because they worked in pairs and were therefore harder to catch. </p> <p>Detective Superintendent Peter Minshall, who coordinates Operation Hawk, said crimes ranged from street robberies to incidents where students were marched from their accommodation to cashpoints to withdraw money. </p> <p>At the freshers week events, most students had a story. Lyndsey Gordon, 22, a first year postgraduate at Umist, was held up at gunpoint at a cash machine in Didsbury Village in south Manchester. She had drawn out \u00a320. \"Two of my friends were at the next cashpoint, it was a well-lit street and I had taken care not to be alone. We were chatting when a man came up behind us. He kept the gun close to his groin so no one could see it and kept repeating, 'Give me the money'. </p> <p>\"We shouted and he ran off. I was so shaken I didn't report it to the police until the next day and by that time it was too late.\" </p> <p>Roland Cory-Wright, a computer studies student, woke up one night to find two strangers downstairs in his house. They fled when they heard his voice, but he found the stereo, television, microwave and his computer lined up by his front door wrapped in towels. </p> <p>Superintendent Holt said it was wrong to attribute crime against students to Manchester's reputation for armed gangs. </p> <p>\"We do have an armed crime and gang problem in Manchester but it is young men with criminal records killing other young men with criminal records. </p> <p>\"The gangs deal with drug running, not street robbery. They are highly unlikely to come into contact with students. They consider themselves above mugging students. They have graduated up the hierarchy of crime.\" </p> <p>But police said thieves played on fear of gangs, telling students: \"I'm from Moss Side, give me all your money.\" </p> <p>Nicola Moore, a welfare officer at Manchester University, advised students to use the \"safety bus\", which for 75p picks up from late clubs at the union and drops students at their door, or the special service for students who have had their wallets stolen. </p> <p>Students give the driver their library card as a deposit and pay their fare the next day. </p> <p>Mr McManus plans to use common sense in future. \"If I see three lads coming towards me, I always cross the road. They will still come after me, but it gives me a headstart on running away. I have stopped going out on my own at night. You just can't.\"</p>",
  "<p>What do you do after starring in one of the most successful British films of all time? If you are Ewan McGregor, you grab your light sabre and sign a long-term deal for Star Wars. If you are Bobby Carlyle you take a turn as a James Bond villain. And Ewen Bremner? If you're the man who as Spud mainlined into the Trainspotting audience's funny bone, you take roles in a number of low-budget, little-seen flops, before opting for art-house kudos with American wunderkind Harmony Korine, and mainstream glamour with the forthcoming blockbuster Pearl Harbor. </p> <p>Unusually for a film star, Bremner is better looking in real life than on screen. Still in his 20s, fresh-faced, with hair closer to strawberry blond than ginger, his features are drawn in bold, angular lines. Bremner made his film debut as a dim-witted schoolboy in the comedy Heavenly Pursuits, 10 years before Trainspotting. With a resum\u00e9 ranging from Shakespeare to Judge Dredd, he has also produced a string of unforgettable cameo appearances, most recently in Snatch, when Vinnie Jones shuts the car window on his head and drives off. </p> <p>Bremner first met writer-director Harmony Korine several years ago. Korine had shocked public opinion with Kids, a portrait of underage sex and drug use which he wrote in his teens. Bremner had been \"blown away\" by Korine's directorial debut Gummo, a low-budget drama about white-trash Ohio kids who kill cats and sell the corpses to a supermarket. </p> <p>\"I'm making a movie that's going to be like nothing else,\" was Korine's modest pitch for Julien Donkey-Boy, the \"plot\" of which was inspired by his Uncle Eddie, who had been in a mental institution for years. The finished script was simply a description of a series of scenes. The actors would mix with members of the public, improvising their lines and being recorded on tiny \"spy cameras\". </p> <p>Korine had been impressed by Bremner's performance as Archie, the inarticulate, twitchy Scots headbanger in Naked, and he suggested Bremner play the supporting role of Julien's brother, an aspiring wrestler and misfit in a film entirely populated by misfits. \"I said, 'I want to play Julien,'\" Bremner recalls, \"and I think he was delighted that I had the audacity to say that I wanted to do it.\" </p> <p>Initially, however, Bremner had grave reservations about his ability to pull off the American accent that would be required. \"I believed that I would be capable of it, but I'm not an actor who is gifted with that aptitude for accents. It was a real struggle for me to lose my Scottish accent. That was the hardest part, it wasn't the psychological aspects of Julien.\" Bremner tried out his accent when he went to visit Korine's Uncle Eddie. \"It was quite difficult to get access to him, but they sneaked me in as a relative.\" He listened to Eddie's fantastical stories, studied his speech patterns - \"so fast and so slurred\" - and crafted a character. He maintained his accent off-set and refused to see Scots friends, for fear those Rs would start rocking and rolling again. \"My girlfriend was losing her patience with me when I was on the telephone... I didn't think I was in character, I was just trying to be American.\" Bremner also totally changed his appearance for Julien and is almost unrecognisable with black, loosely-permed hair and metal teeth. </p> <p>Julien Donkey-Boy is unlike any other film, not just in content, but in tone and ambiguity. In the opening scene, Julien appears to attack and possibly kill a boy at a pond. The incident is never referred to again. Julien works as an assistant at a blind school and is part of a dysfunctional family that includes Chloe Sevigny as his pregnant sister, and the German director Werner Herzog as the father who forces Julien to slap himself for being stupid, and hoses down his other son with cold water because it is character-forming. </p> <p>The film is composed of seemingly dislocated scenes, including a nun masturbating and spanking herself, but a loose storyline eventually starts to emerge, and there is considerable black comedy. \"Stop that shivering,\" says the father, aiming the hose at his son. \"A winner doesn't shiver.\" Meanwhile Julien asks passersby which tree is his family tree. </p> <p>The San Francisco Chronicle called Julien Donkey-Boy a \"self-indulgent mess\", while Entertainment Weekly compared it to the poetry of Robert Frost. \"It's probably the thing that I feel most proud of,\" says Bremner, who, in Julien, has created a character both touching and appalling. He admits it was a huge relief when it was over. \"I had been living in a different world,\" he says. \"Personally I had really isolated myself to do that job. It took me a couple of weeks or so to get it out of my system.\" </p> <p>The film left Bremner not only physically and mentally exhausted, but skint, having spent five months working for next to nothing. It did, however, get him an American agent and a reputation as a Brit who can do an American accent - which ultimately led him to director Michael Bay, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and their take on the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Bremner doubts the makers of The Rock and Armageddon saw Julien Donkey-Boy. \"I'm sure it's not a film that they would want to watch,\" he says. </p> <p>Going from a no-budget, straight-to-video film to a $145m movie must have been quite a culture shock. \"I don't see Julien as a product,\" says Bremner. \"But I see this as a product, a very custom-built blockbuster, a classic of the genre. I don't always have hundreds of options and this was a pretty good one.\" </p> <p>In Pearl Harbor Bremner plays Affleck's co-pilot, but he laughs at the notion that they might replace Cruise and Kilmer as the top guns for the 21st Century. \"There's a lot of stunts and special effects,\" he says. \"We're running around firing guns and that sort of thing, but I'm not putting myself in much danger.\" </p> <p>He did have to go to boot camp, however. \"They really broke us down, me particuarly. The last night of boot camp they were sending someone in to check on me every few minutes, to check I was still breathing.\" He maintains his character is not so different from his previous hapless supporting characters. \"I play an American pilot with a speech impediment, who falls in love and goes to war and becomes a man or a hero. I'm just making Ben Affleck look good, ha-ha.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Julien Donkey-Boy opens on Friday. Pearl Harbor will be released next year.</p>",
  "The Yugoslav electorate has thrown President Slobodan Milosevic into the biggest crisis of his 13 years of power. <p>The man who has always been able to cast himself as the true defender of Serbia's national interests against foreign enemies, whether they be Croats, Bosniacs, Albanians or Nato and the west, has suffered a heavy body-blow from his own people.</p> <p>Whether he has lost the election outright is not yet clear. No official results have been announced, and there is an ominous pause in the counting. </p> <p>But it is already obvious that far more people voted against him than he expected when he called the elections early and decided to submit himself to a popular vote for the first time since 1993. </p> <p>Disarray in his own camp is palpable. His own party, the Socialist party of Serbia, is giving out a completely different set of preliminary findings from its ally, the party known as the Yugoslav Left, which is run by Milosevic's wife. </p> <p>While the SPS claims that Milosevic has 44% of the vote against 41% for his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, officials of the Yugoslav Left put the gap between the two men at 25%.</p> <p>To add to the confusion, the state news agency, Tanjug, has reported claims by the Radical party, another of Milosevic's government allies, that Milosevic is losing. Normally Tanjug suppreses bad news, so the fact that it is indicating that Milosevic is facing defeat means that the regime is either in a total quandary or split into rival camps.</p> <p>Everyone in Serbia is now waiting to see how Milosevic reacts. One option which his prime minister floated at the weekend was that the president was entitled to stay in power until next summer to serve out his full term, even if he accepts he has lost the vote.</p> <p>But this is constitutional nonsense. When you hold early elections, it means you are submitting yourself to the popular will. Otherwise why hold them early? </p> <p>The more violent option is that he brazens it out, claims to have won, and puts down opposition protests with force. But that is unlikely to work. The fact that there is so much dissension within Milosevic's own camp over the results makes it hard for the police and army to be used as a political tool. Senior officers could mutiny.</p> <p>After more than a decade, Serbia is finally in the end game of Milosevic's destructive rule. It took the west until the Kosovo crisis came to the boil two years ago to realise that he is not a reliable partner with whom to do business. </p> <p>Now at last a significant part of the Serbian electorate has come to the same view. Milosevic has long tried to manipulate their emotions through his nationalistic wars and his control of the state-owned media. </p> <p>The lesson of this election is that urban voters and the younger generation who have access to alternative sources of news as well as those Serbs who have close contacts with the huge Serbian diaspora abroad have given the dictator the thumbs-down.</p>",
  "Professor Dorothy Emmet, who has died aged 95, was a distinguished philosopher who headed the department of philosophy at Manchester university for over 20 years; she built it up from a handful of students and a single lecturer to 400 students and a strong and varied staff. <p>Emmet's father was a scholarly country parson in West Hendred, Berkshire, who encouraged wide reading and discussion; she was taught by him, and a governess, until she was in her teens; then, in 1918, she went to St Mary's Hall, Brighton, where the headmistress emphasised the importance of precision in the use of words. She later remarked this was \"not a bad background for philosophy\". </p> <p>In 1923 she went to Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, to study classics and philosophy. She was influenced by AD Lindsay (whose concern to link intellectual and practical issues in political philosophy made such a lasting impression that she once described herself as \"a step- daughter of Balliol\"), RG Collingwood, HA Pritchard (whose agonising over moral problems appealed to her), and J Macmurray. During the general strike of 1926, she heard RH Tawney speak on behalf of the miners, and towards the end of her life she said that this gave her \"the nearest thing I have ever had to a conversion experience\". From then on her interest in philosophy was combined with a serious concern about political and social issues. </p> <p>For several years she spent part of her vacations tutoring for the WEA summer school at Balliol. After graduation, she joined the Maesynhaf Settlement in the Rhondda valley, teaching classes, largely based on Plato, to unemployed miners, many of whom were strongly influenced by Marxism. There were vigorous arguments about morals, politics and economics. One student looked after the books she had brought from Oxford; he was George Thomas, later Speaker of the Commons. </p> <p>From 1928 to 1930, Emmet held a Commonwealth Fellowship at Radcliffe College and attended a graduate seminar held by AN Whitehead, whose thought attracted her to Cambridge, Massachusetts. On returning to England, she held a temporary teaching post at Somerville College, Oxford, had another spell in the Rhondda, and produced her first book, Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism (1932), in which she attempted to demystify his puzzling terminology and ideas. </p> <p>Emmet was appointed lecturer in philosophy at Armstrong College, Newcastle-upon-Tyne (now the University of Newcastle) in 1932. She later described the department as one man and his dog: she was the dog. The department had to cover the whole range of philosophy, but she also managed to include several courses in political philosophy. </p> <p>In 1938, she moved to Manchester as lecturer in the philosophy of religion, becoming reader in philosophy in 1945 and the Sir Samuel Hall professor of philosophy in 1946. During her early wartime years at Manchester, she took her turn fire-watching, and used to describe how classes began with people sharing their air-raid stories of the night before. She used the quieter nights towards the end of the war to write The Nature of Metaphysical Thinking (1945). In it, she responded to the criticisms of logical positivists by suggesting that metaphysics uses concepts analogically to develop a plausible way of interpreting the world. </p> <p>In more than 20 years at Manchester, she showed grace and charm as well as practical wisdom and firmness in dealing with the business of the department and, as dean of arts from 1962 to 1964, with that of the faculty. At a time when philosophy was becoming obsessed with understanding the minutiae of supposedly ordinary language, she was unpersuaded by colleagues who tried to avoid basic questions of truth by holding that all claims were internal to a \"language game\". Her question was: \"But, then, why play the game?\" </p> <p>Since Emmet was convinced that philosophy had much to contribute to the study of other subjects, she encouraged the establishment of joint honours schools and enthusiastically developed links with colleagues in the departments of government, economics and anthropology. Her activities were not confined to Manchester. She gave the annual philosophical lecture to the British Academy in 1949, the Stanton lectures in Cambridge in 1950-53, and was president of the Aristotelian Society in 1953-54. </p> <p>Her philosophical interests in social and political affairs resulted in Function, Purpose and Powers (1958) and Rules, Roles and Relations (1966). In The Moral Prism (1979), she returned to the complexity of individual moral decisions, considering how reliable moral judgments are to be made when there is no single moral theory that adequately solves all problems. Later, she returned to earlier interests in The Effectiveness of Causes (1986), The Passage of Nature (1992), and The Role of the Unrealisable (1994). In 1996 she produced a series of delightful cameos and penetrating comments in her book Philosophers and Friends: Reminiscences of 70 Years in Philosophy. </p> <p>In September 1966, she resigned her chair at Manchester and went to live in Cambridge. She became a regular member of the Moral Sciences Club and, as one of the Epiphany Philosophers, was involved in the publication of the journal, Theoria to Theory. She was elected an emeritus fellow of Lucy Cavendish Hall in Cambridge and an honorary fellow of Lady Margaret Hall. </p> <p>To the end of her days, Emmet keenly followed the fortunes of \"her\" department at Manchester. Her last paper there was given in 1994, when she addressed the question \"Could God be a Person?\" - her delight in probing ideas was just as evident as ever. Those who knew her as teacher and as colleague remember a bright-eyed, questioning and excited thinker unafraid to challenge intellectual fashion and explore uncharted territories. </p> <p> <br>Dorothy Mary Emmet, philosopher, born September 29 1904; died September 20 2000</p>",
  "<p>Internet entrepreneurs are increasingly realising that creating a successful e-commerce site demands more than just attractive prices, well-stocked virtual shopping malls, and reliable ordering structures. They recognise that the magic ingredient is content and that it has the much sought-after power to inspire return visits. In other words, it makes sites \"sticky\". Not only that, it makes them sell. </p> <p>One man who has long understood the selling power of content is Ken Evoy, a 46-year-old internet entrepreneur from Quebec. His company, <a href=\"http://www.SiteSell.com\">SiteSell.com</a>, is a provider of e-commerce information and software and has proved a significant internet success story. The company's first publication, Make Your Site Sell! (MYSS!), written by Evoy himself, quickly went into sales overdrive and is now acknowledged web-wide as the bible of internet marketing. </p> <p>How did Evoy manage to sell so many copies of the book? \"Words - the right ones,\" he replies. \"Of course, the words have to be backed up by great products, or you only end up with angry customers. But it's words that get sales.\" </p> <p>Many dot.coms - especially the much-hyped ones - tend to think that technical pyrotechnics will make their sites sticky and encourage sales. But Evoy dismisses this as a loser's game. \"Technology does not sell products,\" he insists. \"Nor do graphics or animated monkeys. Great products don't even sell themselves. Words sell.\" </p> <p>Because of his belief in the power of words, Evoy teamed up with veteran advertising copywriter and web-savvy author Joe Robson to write an e-book called Make Your Words Sell! (MYWS!), which was released earlier this year by SiteSell.com. Robson is a Yorkshireman who writes web copy that is generally considered to be unparalleled when it comes to selling e-products and services. Indeed, MYWS! - which offers a wealth of practical advice on how to write sales copy for the internet to your best advantage - is a testament to just how compelling and persuasive language can be. </p> <p>During the course of his work, Robson has done a lot of research into what does and doesn't work on the internet. And, like Evoy, he is in no doubt that the websites that are currently successful employ well-crafted copywriting. \"Contrary to popular opinion, there are people out there on the web quietly making extremely good money,\" he reveals. \"But their websites look more like Joe Bloggs in his bedroom. They're not flash. But because they're using good sales copy, they're churning out products like there's no tomorrow and really are making huge profits.\" </p> <p>Growing numbers of dot.coms are waking up to this fact and are consequently looking to hire \"content providers\" (otherwise known as writers) in a big way. One London-based company that has recently added an extensive selection of content to its internet site is <a href=\"http://www.Smarterwork.com\">Smarterwork.com</a> - an \"elance\" site which enables freelance workers to bid on projects posted by businesses. For Pierre Reyland, content editor at Smarterwork, the job of bringing together a team of e-writers proved relatively straightforward. He selected them from the global pool of freelancers who use the Smarterwork site. </p> <p>But he wasn't just looking for good writers - he needed writers who could write specifically for the web. \"Writing for the web is very different from writing for newspapers and magazines,\" he says. \"A monitor screen is not a very friendly interface to read from. So the writing has to be much clearer and more concise. To make a point on the web, you really have to hammer it home - using clear, simple language, highlighting important words, and splitting the text into small paragraphs, with headings and sub-headings, or using devices such as bullet-point lists, and so on.\" </p> <p>Although the skills needed for writing for the web are different from those for print media, a conventional publishing background can be helpful when embarking on an e-writing project. George Giokas, CEO of Staffwriters, a leading US writers' agency, for instance, believes that journalists make excellent web writers. \"For one thing, they are highly skilled in embracing concepts and then relating them in simple form,\" he says. \"But to be successful in writing content for a site, a journalist must also learn the tricks of direct mail, headline writing and advertising. I think a good web writer needs all of the skills from journalism, marketing, graphics and copywriting.\" </p> <p>One writer who has successfully integrated online and offline writing styles is Ann Logan, a freelance education writer from Warwickshire. She relishes the challenges of writing for the internet, but feels it requires more responsibility on the part of the writer. \"Print publications have editors and sub-editors, but the web doesn't,\" she points out. \"So there are fewer critical readers of your work. Because of that, it needs to be triple-checked before you submit it.\" </p> <p>Ability and a conscientious attitude are key attributes to look for when hiring an e-writer. But how can the average internet entrepreneur - who may have had little experience in dealing with writers - be sure that the person they are considering for a project really has what it takes to pen effective web pages? One way is to hire a web writer through Plain Words, a well-established writers' agency based in Berkshire. It tests candidates to ensure they can handle a given project. \"We describe a scenario - fictitious web entrepreneur and product/service - which is relevant to the sort of work they will be doing, and ask them how they would go about researching and writing the website,\" explains Peter Meherne, recruitment director at Plain Words. \"We'd then ask them to produce some brief copy on a particular aspect of the product or service to test their writing skills.\" </p> <p> While strong technical writing skills are essential for keeping readers glued to their VDUs, the cream of web writers take it even further and employ the novelist's technique of writing in \"character\" - in a specific voice. Joe Robson's current web project, The Newbie Club, which he co-runs with US computer wizard Tom Glander, is a case in point. </p> <p>The site is aimed at new computer users and, although Robson and Glander have done little in the way of publicity, the site is proving a runaway success. Why? \"Because we use a distinct voice in the copy,\" says Robson. \"We get into the mindset of our ideal customer. That way, we can talk to them in their language and avoid falling into the trap of talking down to them, like many websites do. The mindset of the Newbies is that of frustration at the amount of technie talk in help files. So I speak very casually, using non-technical words like 'computerish' and 'geekspeak', which they relate to.\" </p> <p>Such a strategy certainly seems to be paying off in terms of sales and the number of visitors to the site. \"It's just phenomenal,\" says Robson. \"And it goes to prove that the big dot.coms who lavish obscene amounts of money on flash websites - and still don't sell anything - must be doing something wrong. They'd save themselves a lot of money if they cut out the gadgets and gizmos and brought in some good copywriters.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Further Information: <br> Ken Evoy's SiteSell.com:<a href=\"http://www.sitesell.com\">www.sitesell.com</a> <br> Smarterwork: <a href=\"http://www.smarterwork.com\">www.smarterwork.com</a> <br> Staffwriters: <a href=\"http://www.staffwriters.com\">www.staffwriters.com</a><br> Ann Logan Writing Services: <a href=\"http://www.annlogan.com\">www.annlogan.com</a><br> Plain Words: <a href=\"http://www.plainwords.co.uk\">www.plainwords.co.uk</a> <br> The Newbie Club: <a href=\"http://www.newbieclub.com\">www.newbieclub.com</a></p>",
  "<p> Salman Rushdie has announced to the world his intention to remove to New York. The reason? The \"bitchiness\" he has encountered on this side of the Atlantic. How spiteful is the London literary world? Or is it just that writers as successful and talented as Salman bring out the worst in Grub Street and its venal hacks? </p> <p>When it comes to grievous literary harm it is said that Rushdie can give as good as he gets. Reviewers who have been unkind, it is rumoured, have come home to find blisteringly angry messages on their answering machines. His fiction has provoked at least one successful libel suit (when he alleged in Midnight's Children that Mrs Gandhi was complicit in her husband's death). Few novelists can claim as high a body count as that racked up by The Satanic Verses. </p> <p>Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of Uncle Tom's Cabin, the \"little woman whose book started a big war\" (as Abraham Lincoln put it) heads that league. None the less there are people dead who would still be living had Rushdie never put pen to paper. At the end of the day, of course, it is fanaticism, not literature, that pulls the trigger. Whatever dispute there may be about his status as a novelist, Rushdie has at least made the English novel matter again. </p> <p>I personally think he is the greatest living novelist we have. And now we have him no longer. Are we then driving away the geese that lay our golden literary eggs? Could we reverse this talent drain by being nicer to our great writers? </p> <p>I suspect that one of the things that most irked Rushdie was the literary party gossip. In the past few weeks, for example, I've heard - as choice, if suspect morsels over the canap\u00e9s - that Rushdie nowadays has a personal trainer (picture that!) and that although he gets a million-dollar advance from his publisher, he leaves one-and-a-half million negative equity when he moves on. </p> <p>But what really got to him, I suspect, were the reviews. There is no question that bad reviews hurt. As much as sticks and stones, if they are done well enough. Nor is there any question that British literary pages do little to discourage hatchetry or the snide review. </p> <p>If you contribute, as I occasionally do, to the literary pages of American organs like the New York Times they virtually do a background check on you and your family to make sure you are unbiased. Not over here. British editors like it when reviewers get personal. </p> <p>America has nothing equivalent to Fleet Street's literary gossip columns (see, for example, the Guardian's own Loafer). Nor in the US is there anything equivalent to Private Eye's book pages. </p> <p>The Eye's bookworms are anonymous. But prime suspects are David Sexton (otherwise literary editor of the Evening Standard), Francis Wheen (who has actually published a collection of his Lord Gnome reviews) and the freelance man of letters, DJ Taylor. As long as they are not writing about you, Private Eye's bitchery is addictive reading. And good reviewing. </p> <p> The London literary world runs on bile. Competition for readers is part of the reason. There are 10 times as many book-page inches in London as in New York and fewer readers for them. As any reviewer knows, readers love the smell of fresh blood above all things. Write something slashing, and your friends will all tell you how much they enjoyed it. Use the word \"splendid\" in the first sentence and you can kiss the reader goodbye. </p> <p>Competition for space is the other main factor. There are some 2,000 new novels published every year in the UK. Only a few hundred can get reviewed at all; only a few score get multiple reviews; only a handful get lead reviews. </p> <p>To achieve visibility for a new novel you need a big advertising budget and a lot of expensive pre-publication promotion. \"Hype\", in a word. Reviewers see themselves as merchandisers of anti-hype. If that means the scalpel, the razor, or even the hatchet, so be it. This is a cancer they must cut out. So what if you lose a genius or two to America in the process. Bitch on, London literary world.</p>",
  "<p>Standing in a night club in Banja Luka in the Republic of Serbska, I'm starting to feel a wee bit nervous. We've bunked out of Nato's vast metal factory base with five pissed squaddies for a Friday night on the town, and the locals have got wise to the fact that we're Brits, mainly because the squaddies are wearing Sheffield United shirts. Three terrifying Serb boneheads are gathering nearby, getting just that bit too close for comfort. No one is talking to us. We stand out like sore thumbs. </p> <p>The promoter, clearly sensing trouble, moves over to talk to the safest face among us - Julie Dawson, who manages British DJs for UK production and management company Wise Buddah. The two of them quickly reach the international language of dance music - hard house, trance, Tong, Rampling and Cox. Then she reveals that she's over here because her company produces Boy George's radio show Clubversive, and the promoter erupts with joy. </p> <p>\"Yes, yes, Clubversive, I hear it on Oxsigen.\" And then he's clapping us on the back and getting us drinks and asking if Boy George would play his club. I think to myself - if only Captain David Bailey were here. He'd practically be in tears by now. </p> <p>Captain Bailey is the man who created Oxsigen for the British army's element of Nato's stabilisation force SFOR. He almost single-handedly built the station's prefab hut studios on the metal factory base. Oxsigen is a dance station, programmed and scheduled just like Kiss, Galaxy or Radio 1, although with curious ad breaks which carry only advice and information on mine clearance and learning to live together again. When Radio 1 says One Love on air, it's a corporate slogan. When Oxsigen's local Serbian, Croat and Bosniac Muslim DJs say it, they mean let's all stop shooting each other. </p> <p>Bailey has been working on the station for two years - an unusually long period in Bosnia where most soldiers only do a six-month tour - but he clearly loves radio. It was his desperate enthusiasm which got Boy George to play on the station: Bailey contacted Wise Buddah which - with George - was so impressed by the outfit that it basically gave him the show for nothing. </p> <p>\"It sounds a bit naive in the UK to talk about dance music changing things, but there's something about it that really brings people together,\" says Boy George. \"That's why we were so happy to give them the show. The generation in Britain before acid house was uptight, homophobic and unsophisticated. Clubbing was about ultra-hip exclusivity and knowing the right people. Since acid house, kids from Britain are now far more sophisticated. I get no one giving me grief because I'm queer and happy, so that can work out in Bosnia too. We're hoping to do some DJ dates there - I'll be the first western DJ out since the war - and it'd be great if Serbian, Croatian and Muslim kids could all be dancing together in the same nightclub.\" </p> <p>Captain Bailey credits George's show with building the station's success. \"Out here there's no radio research, so we have to do what the rest of the local stations do - calculate how many listeners we have from the calls, letters and emails we get,\" he explains. \"That method gives us a 19% share and makes us the most popular station in our area, which I think is a bit optimistic. I reckon we've probably got around 16%, and I'm quite happy with that.\" </p> <p>It's curious for, well, how many reasons do you want? For a start, this is the British army we're talking about. The unit responsible for creating Bosnia's own Kiss FM is called info ops, or in the American army's terrifying newspeak, psyops - psychological operations. This is the section of the military that spent the second world war dropping leaflets over Germany urging all soldiers to overthrow Hitler and surrender. Given the outstandingly poor results that the leaflets delivered, it's no surprise that the section was pretty hard hit in the army's popularity charts and by the time the Gulf war rolled round it didn't really exist. </p> <p>The Americans had kept this whole business going, however, and spent much of the cold war broadcasting \"join capitalism\" messages into places such as Cuba and eastern Europe. Their Gulf war operations had some success and the Brits were impressed. Come the occupation of Bosnia, info ops was back up and running and trying to work out what best to do with its radio frequencies as delivered by the international media commission before Bailey's radio enthusiasm offered an answer. </p> <p>The French and the Americans were also given frequencies for their stations and the Americans are doing just what you'd expect the Brits to do. Their station is very formal and laced with ads for peace that would make a media novice cringe. In one advert, a couple are doing a crossword and the bloke's stumped on a clue. \"Six letters meaning peace...\" he wonders. \"Why darling, that's Dayton,\" she coos. And you can almost hear the militia laying down their arms. </p> <p>The Brits appear to have embraced clubland for inspiration, using Oxsigen. It has also created a free weekly magazine called Mostovi which is handed out by patrolling soldiers and distributed around shops and town centres. </p> <p>Mostovi similarly eschews any sort of heavy-handed SFOR propaganda. Instead, it has a diet of celebrity interviews and lifestyle features with news about all areas of Bosnia Herzegovina - as local media in the Republic of Serbska refuse to write about the Bosnian Croat Federation and vice versa. Of course, there's also mine-clearing information and stories about war criminals which jar to my British eyes when placed next to a feature on George Clooney. </p> <p>\"Our job is to support the mission for SFOR,\" explains Major Nigel Jones, whose job title runs to the delicious SO2 information campaign, HQ multi national division south west. \"And that's to maintain a safe and secure environment. To me, that means stopping people going back to war. To do that, we have to try and change the way they see each other and change what they think is an acceptable way to resolve disputes. With the radio, we're targeting the young. We've got multi-ethnic presenters, give unbiased news - including news that is critical of SFOR - and we work on the premise that if the magazine we produce is boring and worthy then no one's going to read it.\" </p> <p>Up in Prijador - the town where ITN filmed those infamous concentration camp-like scenes of starving Croats behind barbed wire - two of the station's 18-year-old listeners chat about its popularity. \"I listen because it gets the new music quicker than local stations,\" says Rada, a Serbian girl. \"I listen to it because it is the only station where I can speak my mind,\" says Alecsandra. \"There's almost 300 radio stations out here and all of them are controlled by political factions,\" she explains. \"I call Oxsigen's phone-ins because I've seen and heard things I shouldn't have and I need to tell someone.\" </p> <p>And so she tells me. Her dad is Serbian and her mum is Muslim. When she was 11 years old, the locals burned down her next-door neighbours' house because they were Muslims. She lay awake that night hearing her neighbours' screams as they burned to death, wondering if her mother was next. Now she wants to leave. It all looks grim to her and she's the sort of person the station needs to reassure. </p> <p>Back in the club, you could believe there is some hope. The squaddies have split and they're all in the middle of the dance floor, hands in the air as the DJ builds a storming set. There are Croats and Serbs and Bosnians here and people may be slagging off SFOR but they're buying the squaddies rounds of Amstel. The guy on the podium with the lurid green glo-sticks steps down and chats to me about music, always music, and doesn't want to know when I get on to politics, so that just for one, naive, 1988 Summer Of Love moment you actually do think that music could make a difference. Or maybe that's just the beer talking. </p>",
  "A devastating portrait of a wilful and manipulative Princess Diana emerged yesterday from extracts of a book written by her former private secretary, Patrick Jephson, printed in the Sunday Times. <p>Publication of Shadows of a Princess, due to come out in Britain and the US next month, has already been condemned as deplorable by the Queen and the Prince of Wales. But from the extract published yesterday the royal family could take comfort from the fact that the outlines and much of the detail are already well known - and much more damaging to the memory of the princess than to themselves. </p> <p>That may be of small comfort to Mr Jephson, who, although standing to make a great deal of money, knows he will be cast into outer darkness by the Palace and may be stripped of an honour bestowed on him for his service. </p> <p>Both the palace, which sought for two years to stop the book being published, and the newspaper which purchased the revelations may feel they could have been much worse. Mr Jephson was the princess's equerry and then private secretary for more than seven years until January 1996. He watched the breakdown of her marriage and was instrumental in handling the divorce. </p> <p>The author claimed that his book would give a more rounded portrait of the princess than previous publications and that it would be \"entirely positive\" for her sons, Princes William and Harry. \"For them there will be nothing new to learn from this that's harmful and a lot of new stuff that's good,\" the paper quoted him as saying. </p> <p>The book claims the princess referred to the Duke of Edinburgh as \"Stavros\", mocking his Greek roots, and said at one point that her royal jewellery was a reward for \"years of purgatory with this f***ing family\". The book suggests nevertheless that \"a small handful of sugar lumps\" could have wooed her back to the royal family. She \"did not set out to rebel. What in the end was seen as her disaffection was what she did to compensate for a chronic feeling of rejection\". </p> <p>The book claims that Diana found the family emotionally cold and unfriendly and became increasingly reckless in her behaviour, taking a string of lovers - including one smuggled into Kensington Palace in the boot of her car - and becoming paranoid about non-existent plots to bug her conversations or even assassinate her. </p> <p>The author claims she told him that the letter from the Queen in 1995, telling the couple to get a divorce following Diana's Panorama interview, was the first letter her mother-in-law had ever sent her. </p> <p>Mr Jephson says the princess told him she had confronted Camilla Parker-Bowles at a party and asked her to leave Charles alone, but had received a stony response which left her in tears. </p> <p>The princess's 43-year-old former secretary - originally seconded from the Royal Navy, and now running a public relations consultancy and living in Fulham - divulges Diana's ruthless treatment of her staff and her love of dirty jokes. </p> <p>He claims she once exulted in accusing Tiggy Legge-Bourke, her sons' nanny, at a party of having had an abortion. Mr Jephson claims she sent him and other staff members hurtful messages by pager. </p> <p>But he says: \"For all the squandered chances, the stupidity, the occasional downright wickedness, there was something heroic about her just as there was something essentially brutal about those gathered against her.\" </p> <p>Last night a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: \"We have said everything we are going to say about this book.\"</p>",
  "A new warning issued by the Medicines Control Agency, stating that people may feel suicidal in the first few weeks of taking Prozac and similar antidepressants, is dangerously misleading and could lead to more deaths, according to a leading authority on the drugs. <p>David Healy, director of the North Wales Department of Psychological Medicine in Bangor, has told the MCA that among those who are not severely depressed - who are the majority of those now being given antidepressants - it is the drugs, and not the illness, that make people want to kill themselves. </p> <p>The warning will lead to doctors keeping their patients on the drugs in the assumption that the medication will eventually make them better, when they need to be taken off. </p> <p>The new warning is the MCA's response to increasing public concern over suicides among people on drugs in the Prozac class. The agency has instructed manufacturers to include it in the drug datasheets for doctors and information leaflets for patients. It states that suicidal thoughts may occur or increase in the early weeks of treatment, and may continue for some time until the drug takes effect. </p> <p>But Dr Healy, the UK's leading historian of antidepressant medication, believes it is the drugs themselves that are causing some people to feel like killing themselves - not depression. And if, as the patient leaflet warning states, there is an increase in suicidal thoughts, he says, it can only be due to an effect of the drug. </p> <p>But increasingly the SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are being given to adults and children who are not depressed, but merely anxious and who should therefore have no suicidal feelings. </p> <p>Dr Healy has written to Keith Jones, director of the MCA, pointing to two studies - one of them carried out by his own team - showing that healthy volunteers with no history of depression have become dangerously suicidal after taking one of the SSRI class of drugs for a couple of weeks. </p> <p>\"This will lead to deaths,\" he told Dr Jones in a letter. \"Your advice will lead to a situation where patients who worsen on treatment will be kept on that treatment by their GPs in the belief that it is only in this way that the suicide risk can ultimately be lowered. This is mistaken advice that is going to increase the rate at which patients move from emergent suicidality[beginning to feel suicidal] to suicidal acts.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year, Dr Healy published a study of the effects of one of the SSRIs, sertraline, on 20 healthy volunteers. Two of them became suicidal. One told researchers that she had become obsessed with the idea of throwing herself under a car or a train, while the other fantasised about hanging herself from a beam in the bedroom ceiling. </p> <p>The MCA also has in its possession a much earlier study of the effects of sertraline on healthy volunteers. Dr Jones acknowledged in a letter to Dr Healy that this study similarly shows a \"pattern of severe adverse side-effects and drop outs.\" He goes on to remark that the pattern \"seen in this small study was not replicated in any other study involving sertraline\". </p> <p>Yet it has been - in the Healy study published earlier this year in Primary Care Psychiatry and revealed in the Guardian in May. These two studies, says Dr Healy, would be conclusive enough for the manufacturers to get a license from the MCA to market sertraline as a drug to cause agitation - if anybody had a use for such a medicine. Yet the MCA will not accept that this, and other SSRIs, can cause people to feel suicidal as a side-effect. </p> <p>The MCA's decision to require a new warning with the SSRIs was taken after a review of the data by the Committee on the Safety of Medicines. </p> <p>The MCA said in a statement that the CSM had considered both the healthy volunteer studies as part of the overall risk assessment. </p> <p>\"The CSM concluded that reports of suicidal thoughts in healthy volunteers were difficult to explain, however, other data were reassuring. For this reason, the issue will be kept under review and further advice will be sought as necessary.\"</p>",
  "As regrettable mishaps in balloons go, it was on a scale that would have made even Richard Branson blush. <p>Only this time it was a pair of unfortunate Germans who were at the centre of a hot air emergency. </p> <p>It began on Friday as Peter Wittman, 32, and Heinrich Brachtendorf, 67, climbed into their basket in the German town of Marl, north of Essen, and took to the skies alongside fellow ballooning enthusiasts as part of a competition to see who could stay in the air the longest - but at least they won. </p> <p>The pair, however, probably did not intend to stay up quite as long as they did. </p> <p>In the early hours of Saturday morning, a radar operator at a military air traffic control centre in London spotted an unexpected blip on his screen. Noting that something was awry, the operator informed the RAF. </p> <p>Immediately, the air rescue co-ordination centre, at Kin loss, swung into action. A Sea King helicopter was scrambled and at around 9.30pm it was able to define exactly what had caused the blip. </p> <p>In the stormy skies over the coast of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, the German balloonists, who had by now sent out a distress signal, were more than a few miles off course - and were heading even further afield. </p> <p>\"A search and rescue helicopter followed the balloon up the east coast until it went into the area of RAF Boulmer in Northumberland,\" said a Min istry of Defence spokesman. As strong winds blew the balloon up the coast, it became apparent that the Germans were now heading for Scotland, if not out to sea. </p> <p>Forth coastguard scrambled its rescue team from Carnoustie, near Dundee, and RNLI lifeboats from Arbroath and Broughty Ferry were launched. </p> <p>But amid the poor visibility of mist and clouds, an RAF pilot succeeded in making contact with the German crew. </p> <p>\"Near Dundee an RAF helicopter managed to talk the crew down and they were met on the ground by police,\" said the MoD spokesman. </p> <p>The pair landed near a beach at Carnoustie at 3.40am on Saturday, though an RAF spokesman pointed out things could have been far worse. </p> <p>\"If they had continued they would have run into a storm in the Cairngorms and then the next spot they would have been able to put down would have been the Faroe Islands,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Wittman and Mr Bracht endorf say they were not scared. \"We just concentrated on keeping ourselves up,\" said Mr Wittman. </p> <p>They were, however, surprised by where their competition finally brought them. </p> <p>Mr Wittman said: \"There is no set flight path, you just go up, but we didn't mean to end up over Scotland.\" </p> <p>The pair were airborne for almost a day and they did, at least, manage to win their competition, though perhaps not quite in the style they would have wished.</p>",
  "One of a group of gangland brothers, dubbed the Canadian Krays, is to be deported to Britain this month after he is released on parole. <p>Scots-born Philip Wood, 44, has served 14 years of a life sentence for murdering a 21-year-old woman who was due to give evidence against him in a drugs trial. </p> <p>He emigrated to Canada as a child from Ayrshire in 1965, but he does not have full citizenship and the Canadian authorities insist he must return to Britain. </p> <p>In 1986, Wood and his brothers, David, 47, and Colin, 42, murdered Karen Thomson by attacking her then throwing her into Lake Ontario to drown. Ms Thomson, Colin's girlfriend, was due to be a key prosecution witness in a drugs case faced by the brothers. </p> <p>Wood was granted parole last week and a Foreign Office spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that he would be back in Britain by the end of the month. </p> <p>\"Philip Wood is due to be released around the end of September and the instruction from the Canadian authorities is that he will be deported,\" she said. She could not say when Wood would arrive in Britain or where he would stay. A prisoner release organisation was helping him find accommodation. </p> <p>David Wood is also eligible for parole but he is reported to have agreed to stay in prison for a further three months to complete psychiatric treatment. It is understood he will also return to Britain when released. </p> <p>Colin Wood escaped from prison in 1994 and spent three years on the run before he was tracked down in Alabama. He is due to spend three more years in prison before he is deported to Britain. </p> <p>A row broke out in 1997 when it emerged that the men were likely be deported. Canadian immigration officials said the brothers were not technically Canadian citizens and, under Canadian law, anyone serving more than 10 years in prison can be returned to their country of origin. </p> <p>As Wood and his brothers have not been convicted of a crime in Britain, they will not be subject to any form of supervision. Three years ago the MP Henry McLeish, then a Scottish Office minister, said he would petition Jack Straw, the home secretary, for changes in the immigration law regarding parole. </p> <p>Mr McLeish said he wanted to ensure that criminals returning to Britain were subject to the same constraints as those released from British prisons. But the law has not yet been changed. </p> <p>The Scottish Conservatives' justice spokesman, Phil Gallie, said the deportation of Wood was deeply worrying. \"I think Canada is backing out of its moral responsibility by sending him here but we do not have the right to interfere in another country's processes, so we have to cater for the situation we are stuck with.\" </p> <p>The Wood brothers became involved with a notorious gang in Toronto in their teenage years. By the time they reached their 20s, they ran a drugs and crime syndicate. Between them they have more than 100 convictions for drugs offences, assaults and theft.</p>",
  "The government of Israel is strenuously promoting an idea once unthinkable: entrusting Judaism's holiest site to United Nations control. <p>The acting foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, leaves for Cairo today, where he is to sound out Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, on a proposal to transfer sovereignty of the Temple Mount, or Haram al-Sharif - 86 hectares of hallowed ground on the most fiercely contested hilltop in the Middle East - to the supervision of the five permanent members of the UN security council. </p> <p>He is also due to talk later in the week with King Abdullah of Jordan, who has played a pivotal role in the tantalisingly slow search for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. </p> <p>Mr Ben Ami's mission coincides with American efforts to convene a new meeting between the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Of the 460 hours devoted to peacemaking at the Camp David summit attended by both last July, the two men only spent one hour together. </p> <p>The very notion that the UN could be part of the solution for the Haram al-Sharif, where history, emotion and religion collide, represents a staggering change in Israeli government policy. </p> <p>The idea is believed to have resurfaced now as an attempt by Israel to counter a proposal by the Palestinians earlier this month, to lodge sovereignty for the site with the Jerusalem committee of the Organisation of Islamic Countries. </p> <p>The Haram is sacred to Muslims for the shimmering gold Dome of the Rock that marks the spot where the prophet Mohammed is said to have ascended to heaven; and to Jews, who revere it as the site of their temple, which was destroyed in 70AD, and where God is meant to have called Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac. </p> <p>From insisting that Israel would remain sole sovereign of Jerusalem, including all areas of Arab East Jerusalem occupied since 1967, the prime minister, Ehud Barak, has abandoned a whole series of shibboleths in the space of two months. </p> <p>Since the Camp David meeting ended without agreement in the summer, Israeli officials have floated a bewildering number of proposals for resolving the status of the Haram al-Sharif. The most ingenious include divine sovereignty - handing the whole site over to God's control; and vertical sovereignty - with Palestinians the absolute rulers above ground, and Israelis the master of what lies beneath. </p> <p>Since 1967, Muslim authorities appointed by Jordan have controlled the mosques. Palestinian police patrol the Haram, and Israeli security forces man the gates and oversee security for the adjacent Western Wall (often known as the Wailing Wall), the holiest shrine of Judaism. </p> <p>US efforts to steer both sides towards agreement suffered a setback at the weekend with Washington's suspension of its ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk. State department officials said he was suspected of \"sloppy handling of classified information\", using an unsecured laptop for sensitive information, and sending emails on an ordinary phone line.</p>",
  "<p>Without a minimum wage, \"the good employers are undercut by the bad, and the bad are undercut by the worst\". So said Winston Churchill in 1909 when the Liberal government introduced wages councils to represent the 'sweated' trades.</p> <p>It took another 90 years for Churchill's principle to be extended to all low-paid workers, and for sweat-shop wages to be removed as a form of competition between employers.</p> <p>But the introduction of a national minimum wage last year did not win universal approval. Many of those who opposed it - and even some who supported it - believed it would be a burden on business, damaging employment, pushing up costs and affecting the ability to compete. Even the low-pay commission, which supports the minimum wage, urged a 'prudent' approach in order to \"avoid the adverse effects on business and the economy\".</p> <p>At Cambridge University's centre for business research (CBR), we have been trying to find out whether these pessimistic forecasts have come true. While other research has assessed the impact on employees, we have been focusing on the response of employers, particularly in small and medium-sized businesses. The answers so far are that there are no negative effects on employment and that the minimum wage is beginning to act as a spur to competition and efficiency. Paying the minimum wage has raised employers' costs, but this affects their competitors as well.</p> <p>We shall be revealing more of our findings at a conference in Cambridge this Friday when the CBR launches 'British Enterprise in Transition'. </p> <p>This study of more than 1,300 small and medium-sized businesses across the country, funded by the economic and social research council, provides evidence that the impact of the minimum wage on the product market strategies of small businesses is more positive than negative. One third of small firms are responding by adopting new, non-wage forms of competition.</p> <p>Businesses who employed at least some staff on the minimum wage were asked whether they had increased or decreased their emphasis on a range of competitive strategies. We discovered that 33.6% of businesses had increased their use of certain strategies, especially personal attention to client needs, price, product/service quality, and increased specialisation.</p> <p>Among these businesses, we saw a difference between the way innovating and non-innovating firms responded. Innovators were more likely to promote flair and creativity; non-innovators to emphasise price and established reputation. These findings echo a study carried out earlier this year for the low-pay commission by Frank Wilkinson and CBR colleagues Anna Bullock and Alan Hughes. This focused on the cleaning and security sectors - hitherto notorious for low pay.</p> <p>Similarly, it shows that some concerns about the minimum wage have not materialised. There were worries, for example, that companies would resort to younger workers with reduced entitlement to the minimum wage. But so far there is no evidence of this.</p> <p>Instead, what we see again is that the minimum wage has put pressure on firms to improve their performance. A substantial minority of firms surveyed -particularly in manufacturing, cleaning and security - sought to raise their efficiency by increasing their control of non-labour, as well as labour costs. Our research for the low-pay commission into the effects of the minimum wage continues - as does the debate as to whether it is damaging, or benefiting the economy.</p> <p>Ninety years ago, Churchill thought that a minimum wage would provide a stimulus to firms to follow a higher-road competitive strategy. It looks as though he was right.</p> <p>\u0095 Mike Kitson and Frank Wilkinson are researchers at the Centre for Business Research at Cambridge University</p>",

  "<p>A novelist once claimed that the hardest aspect of fiction was deciding which jobs to give your characters. Few writers have been on proper payrolls, which is why so many central characters tend to be journalists or novelists. In television, except for series where the job is the plot - the cop, doc, vet and teacher shows - people tend to be vaguely \"in business\" or doing something unspecified in sales or accounts. </p> <p>So long after the Industrial Revolution, writers never expected to be given an entire new profession to deal with - until the internet. The sharp and promising new drama Attachments (Tuesday, 9pm, BBC2) is set among young people setting up a website ). It's no surprise to find this series getting here so quickly, because its creator Tony Garnett made This Life. Many people would have set a yuppie drama among ad executives, but the genius of This Life was to realise the undercurrents of class, sex and deceit to be found in the legal profession. </p> <p>Attachments, on the evidence of an opening episode from This Life writer Richard Zajdli, is similarly impressive in the way that the professional setting remains relevant to the look and feel of the series. Sex and love may be a major theme - as the email pun in the title gives away (the series was at one point called Click) - but the internet is never simply the background metaphor and CV-dressing that it is, for example, in the new David Hare stage play My Zinc Bed. </p> <p>In Attachments, important plot twists result from web cameras and email and, as the lawyers in This Life carried their professional lying and power games into their private lives, so the excitability and fickleness of these characters results partly from working in one of the few professions in which days of work can vanish by hitting the wrong switch. Attachments does a good job, in part because of its unusual sensitivity to work.</p>",
  "Nicholas Edwards was finally found guilty of rape at the Old Bailey last week. It was his eighth trial on rape charges, but what was unusual was that this time the jury knew something of his history. In most rape trials the 12 men and women who have to decide the accused's fate are kept in the dark, unaware whether the man before them has a long history - in Edwards' case, 19 years - of forcing women to have sex with him. Edwards had been twice before convicted of rape and acquitted five times. <p>Each time he admitted that sexual intercourse took place, but claimed that the women consented. As his story shows, by no means all men acquitted of rape are innocent. Some are serial rapists and many, like Edwards, have repeatedly got away with it. But a landmark ruling by the law lords, which saw the 39-year-old welder put away for life last week, could put many more behind bars. </p> <p>Edwards was one of the serial rapists documented in a 1993 edition of Channel 4's Dispatches programme, Getting Away with Rape, after he was acquitted for the fourth time. In the latest trial he claimed to have had sex with 2,000 women. But how many of his conquests consented? After the trial started, two more women came forward to say Edwards had raped them too. A nurse who accused Edwards of raping her in the early 1990s replied when she was accused of lying in the witness box: \"Do you think I'm going to put myself through this ordeal and waste all the time of the police and courts if it didn't happen?\" </p> <p>Yet Edwards was acquitted. He smiled and clapped when the not guilty verdict was announced, and bowed to the jurors, saying: \"Thank you very much. Cheers.\" </p> <p>Far more men are acquitted of rape than convicted. The conviction rate for reported rapes has dropped from 24% in 1985 to a mere 7% today. This is in spite of advances in DNA analysis which enable separate rapes to be linked. At the same time, the proportion of rapes committed by strangers has dwindled to a mere 12% of reported cases, according to the Home Office's most recent analysis, published in 1999. Stranger rapists use the defence of identification rather than consent and with advances in DNA analysis, identity can now usually be proved. </p> <p>Serial rapists may well be learning different tactics once they realise that they are much more likely to get off if they chat up their victim beforehand and then argue that the woman consented. This could explain, at least in part, the drop in the proportion of stranger rapes. Edwards was not the mythical unknown rapist who leaps on his victims in the dark. His crimes, like most rapes, could be categorised as \"date rape\" - a term often used loosely and inappropriately to cover any rape between acquaintances. The term implies that the rape is somehow less serious, that it happened almost accidentally when the man misread the signals given by the woman. But Edwards did not misread signals. He planned his rapes carefully and they fell into a common pattern. His victims were not long-standing girlfriends but women he had met only a short time before and apparently targeted. </p> <p> In the latest trial, four of the women who had accused him and had their accusations dismissed by previous juries were allowed to testify following a historic ruling of the House of Lords last June. They were joined by another woman whose story had led to one of his two previous convictions. All recounted being raped by him in strikingly similar circumstances. </p> <p>In each case, he first went up to the woman in a public place. He adopted a low-key approach to gain her confidence, making a date for another meeting. At the second meeting, he continued to chat her up and then isolated her, in most cases by driving her to a secluded spot - in two cases to the same churchyard. Then he changed from Jekyll to Hyde. His mood, previously calm, became angry and he became a domineering, terrifying bully, forcing his victims to give in to his demands. He refused to use a condom and intercourse was accompanied in each case by comments and instructions from him, telling the girl what to do. Afterwards he reverted to friendliness, often denying that anything untoward had occurred. </p> <p>Like many serial rapists, Edwards has adopted more sophisticated tactics and become more adept at avoiding conviction. In the first case that came to court, in 1983, he held a knife to the victim's throat. The knife was produced in court and this led to his conviction. He never used a weapon again. In the latest case, he managed to persuade the woman to go to his south London flat. As he would know, juries rarely convict where a woman is raped after accepting an invitation to the man's home. This case would probably not even have come to trial if the other women had not been allowed to give evidence. </p> <p>That breakthrough followed a legal battle by the crown prosecution service to get the evidence in front of the jury. Judges have a discretion to allow juries to hear evidence that the accused has behaved in a similar way in other cases - so called \"similar fact\" evidence - if the details show a strikingly similar pattern of behaviour. The judge has to decide whether the value of the evidence in proving the charges is so strong that it outweighs the prejudice to the accused. If so, and if admitting the evidence will not make the trial unfair, it can be allowed in. </p> <p>But there was a stumbling block. In a 1950 case the privy council had ruled that a jury verdict was binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings. For the past 50 years that had been interpreted to mean that once an accused was acquitted, no evidence to show that he had actually committed the offence could be brought forward at a later trial. To do so, it was thought, would breach the \"double jeopardy\" rule by which no one can be tried twice for the same crime, a cornerstone of the British justice system. </p> <p>The trial judge disallowed the evidence. The prosecution took the matter to the appeal court, which dismissed it, ruling that a prior acquittal not only precluded a second prosecution for the same offence but also barred the crown from citing evidence in a later prosecution that showed that the defendant was actually guilty of the charge of which he had been acquitted. The court reached this decision \"with regret\" and gave permission for an appeal to the Lords. </p> <p>The law lords allowed the prosecution's appeal, overruling the 1950 judgment and setting a new precedent. The five judges said that allowing the women to give their evidence would not breach the double jeopardy rule because Edwards was not now at risk of conviction on the earlier rape charges, but only on the charge for which he was standing trial. The evidence was relevant and came within the ambit of the \"similar fact\" rule, and was not inadmissible just because it tended to show that the defendant was in fact guilty of offences of which he had earlier been acquitted. </p> <p>It is a controversial change and not all lawyers agree with it. The law lords' ruling was in line with a recent Law Commission report on double jeopardy, but Andrew Trollope QC, who chaired the Criminal Bar Association group that responded to the Law Commission paper, believes the change breaches the principle that underlies the rule of double jeopardy. \"You may easily draw the conclusion that because a man's been accused of rape eight times over, he must be guilty. That's a very dangerous road to go down. You have to remember that in those instances, or a number of those instances, the facts have been closely examined by previous courts and that there has been a doubt in each case.\" Bruce Houlder QC, vice-chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, argues on the other hand that it \"defies common sense\" to exclude such evidence. </p> <p>The change in the law can be seen as an acknowledgment that multiple rapists are going free and that something needs to be done about the high acquittal rate. The acquittal of serial rapists is far more common than often imagined. </p> <p>Very few men rape only once, and with this change more guilty men will be brought to justice. Perhaps at last the dramatic drop in the conviction rate will be reversed. Women should be encouraged to report rapes and to give evidence in court after this landmark decision. </p> <p>\u0095 Sue Lees is professor of women's studies at the University of North London and author of Carnal Knowledge: Rape on Trial.

  "It was a little sneaky of the Lord Chancellor's department to release their most important publication of the year when they knew I was away on a crucial summer research trip in the south of France. I refer, of course, to the long-awaited and much-speculated-on Media Guide for the Judges, which had gone through more revisions than James Joyce's Ulysses. To take a typical issue that had been bothering me for years: what should a judge do on finding a reporter outside his or her house? Should he follow the imaginative example of the now retired Mr Justice Harman, whose solution was to kick the reporter in the goolies, only to be told that the chap was in fact the cabbie driving him to court? Try unsuccessfully to hide his face with a poorly positioned white handkerchief or newspaper (also a Harman ploy)? Swear at the reporter, coupling it with an invitation to settle the matter right there and then, pugilistically? Alas, all the above have found their way to the \"don't\" section of the advice, although I believe that some of them were controversially transferred from the \"do\" only at the last minute. <p>The \"do\" section urges judges to stay calm and polite, and look friendly. But one piece of advice goes further, urging the judges, virtually in so many words, to behave like a lone Clint Eastwood unexpectedly confronted by a band of outlaws: \"If you find yourself at the centre of a media scrum - stop walking momentarily. You will find that the reporters and photographers will naturally back off to give you space. Having established a degree of control, continue on.\" Wow, that's what I call judicial fightin' talk. But what if we don't back away? </p> <p>\u0095 The law lords sitting on the privy council also managed to slip in a dramatically important judgment in my absence. In an appeal from Jamaica by prisoners on death row, the judges ruled - overturning a long line of previous decisions - that the prisoners should not be executed until their petitions to international bodies such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights had been ruled on. The point is that death row prisoners in almost all Caribbean countries make pleas to such bodies; until now the state could disregard them and execute even when the cases were still pending. Potentially, the privy council decision will save many lives and change the face of capital punishment in the Caribbean. </p> <p>The decision wasn't unanimous. Lord Hoffman dissented. Not for the first time - I choose my words carefully - he has come out in favour of an interpretation of the law that has the effect of allowing the death penalty. In at least one case he was in a 3-2 majority, and prisoners were executed as a result. This time he was alone. </p> <p>\u0095 The National Film Theatre and Geoffrey Robertson QC's Doughty Street Chambers have compiled an interesting selection of courtroom dramas to be shown at the NFT during October, many of them introduced or discussed by John Mortimer and various QCs. The 15 films include some of the classics (Twelve Angry Men, Judgment at Nuremberg, Inherit the Wind, the underrated Anatomy of a Murder) and a televised version of the brilliant play about the Steve Biko inquest, with Albert Finney playing the barrister Sydney Kentridge. It's a pity that the organisers were (presumably) unable to get hold of what, for me, are the two most satisfying courtroom dramas of them all: To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution. On the other hand, I am much relieved that the programme doesn't include In the Name of the Father, the Hollywoodised story of the Guildford Four, the courtroom scenes of which are the most ludicrous and wildly inaccurate ever seen on a cinema screen. The film versions of Judge Dredd and the Queen of Hearts's sentencing process in Alice in Wonderland are models of careful research in comparison (though admittedly \"Off with her head\" was not a valid sentence at the time, due to lack of a guillotine). </p> <p>\u0095 I don't do plugs in this column, but I cannot remember the last time I was so impressed with a book about the law. It explains and demystifies the English legal system - how it works , who is in it - simply yet with authority, clearly yet comprehensively. \"A kind of upbeat legal mixture of Madame Bovary, As You Like It and La Traviata. I loved every page.\" (Albert Einstein). The title is The Law Machine (5th edition), published by Penguin, by Marcel Berlins (a columnist) and Clare Dyer, legal correspondent of this parish.</p>",
  "<p>Great architecture has never been dependent on the expenditure of vast sums of money. It can be, yet there is no law that says it must be. I reminded myself of this by making a pilgrimage to what for me is one of the very greatest buildings of all time. This is the monastery of Sainte-Marie de la Tourette near Eveux-sur-l'Arbresle, Lyon, consecrated in 1960 and built cheaply from humble concrete. </p> <p>To make such an extravagant claim for the building is bold, given that this Dominican monastery, although designed in the spirit of the chaste Carthusian foundations of medieval Italy, may look to some like a brutalist refugee from London's South Bank. </p> <p>Yet here is a building that is at once as poor and as rich as the mendicant monks for whom it was designed and built. Poor in terms of cost and the stark poverty of the materials used to build it, rich in ideas and spirituality. Today, much new architecture is slick and polished, erected by teams of highly competent contractors and engineers working to designs fed through fairly reliable computer programs. The buildings, whether office blocks, shopping malls or distribution depots (or public libraries, hospitals or schools) are expensive in absolute terms, yet generally good value for money given what they are required to do. Most, however, are soulless or even cynical. </p> <p>La Tourette, by contrast, is a tour de force. Set high on a ridge overlooking the vineyards of Beaujolais country, this college and monastery, now essentially a lay study centre, was commissioned from the great architect Le Corbusier by the formidable priest P\u00e8re Couturier. This was in 1953. Le Corbusier had already, encouraged by Couturier, been working on the superb pilgrimage chapel of Notre-Dame du Haut at Ronchamp (1950-54). Buildings such as this and La Tourette marked a profound change in Le Corbusier's approach to architecture; a move away from the severe, white geometry of his pre-war years. They also represented a new architecture for a church trying to come to terms with a world of modernism and progress. </p> <p>An artist who was to live a monk-like existence in his later years, Le Corbusier had always been drawn to the powerful yet simple architecture of the most severe medieval monasteries. While learning to be an architect, back in 1907-11, he had travelled throughout the Mediterranean and central Europe, and had been particularly inspired by the Charterhouse of Ema at Galluzzo, Tuscany. That building, with its interplay of collective spaces and \"living cells\", influenced his later work, so that many of his famous buildings - long before he designed La Tourette - seem like monasteries in one form or other. The Pavillon Suisse (1930) and the Unit\u00e9 d'Habitation housing block in Marseilles (1946-52) certainly have that look and feel. </p> <p>Le Corbusier had always been fascinated by religion and the religious experience. Swiss by birth, he was a descendant of the Cathars - the 13th-century Albigensian heretics - all but exterminated by St Dominic and his Inquisition shock-troops appointed to their gruesome task in the Languedoc by the Vatican. I felt, as I sat in the church at La Tourette, as if the architect must have been reconciled to that distant historical memory by the act of building so intelligently for those who would have burned him at the stake had he been alive seven centuries earlier. </p> <p>Le Corbusier pondered the design of La Tourette for three whole years before the concrete mixers turned. The result was a design of immense subtlety and grace. Planned around a central glazed cloister, three sides of the building comprise lecture rooms, refectory, chapter room, library and two storeys of cells, each with its own loggia. The fourth is dominated by the church. The complex yet contained geometry of the building is broken by two dramatic elements - the oratory with its pyramid roof that juts into the cloister, and the undulating wall of the lower church, its roof capped with sloping rooflights. </p> <p>The monastery is bathed in a wash of ever-changing daylight, except for the deliberate darkness of the oratory. After the dank rigours of 19th-century Gothic revival colleges, it must have been a relief to the Dominican novices who came here to be bathed in sun, light and air; to experience an architecture that was at once ancient and modern. Though La Tourette has unfinished ceilings and exposed pipework, though it is a little crumbly 40 years on, it still lifts the soul. </p> <p>Le Corbusier had come to believe that the beautiful, taut, white villas he had built in his 40s were for the eye only; now, in his 60s and into his 70s, he wanted to engage all the senses and the spirit, too. To do so, he made his architecture increasingly less pure, less slick. And into the design of La Tourette he poured a lifetime's learning - not just of architecture, but of the Bible, of Greek myths, of the scholastic philosophy propounded by the Dominicans (from St Thomas Aquinas). </p> <p>La Tourette is not just another bru talist concrete building. There is immense subtlety in its proportions, and in the way that light plays through its cells, lecture rooms and corridors. There is, too, a quiet virtuosity in the way that the monastery's spaces have been gently squeezed into what proves to be a much smaller building than its dominant position in its wine-growing landscape suggests. </p> <p>Here is an architecture of real maturity, but also of grace and, above all, of poverty. A freely chosen poverty very much at odds with our shiny new world, 40 money-grabbing and money-blowing years down the line. </p> <p>\u0095 Sainte-Marie de la Tourette, Eveux-sur- l'Arbresle, near Lyon, France, can be visited.

  "Karl Lagerfeld predicted that plastic surgery would be the haute couture of the 21st century, but maybe we should make that airbrushing. Mel B knows all about airbrushing - or digital removal in Photo Shop as it's known in the trade. She recently did a shoot for Loaded wearing a bikini, but when the magazine came out this month, there she was on the cover, wearing just a light swarm of bees around her more sensitive parts. <p>She says she's going to sue, but frankly - apart from the obvious point of what did she expect, doing a photo shoot with Loaded - she surely can't deny that the airbrush has done her a few favours? What, not even a single line on your face, Mel? Not a single stretchmark after the birth of your baby daughter? Amazing, such naturally perky breasts? The airbrush is every celebrity's best friend these days. </p> <p>Take nude Robbie Williams on the cover of this month's Vogue, photographed with model Gisele by Mario Testino. Airbrush, honey-coloured lighting, almond oil (used by the pros for that genuine sexually abandoned glow), it's all the same, it's all a game. </p> <p>There are other ways of reading these pictures, of course. The Loaded image is not a pleasant one. Mel's body is being molested by bees. True, Robbie's behind is exposed, but he gets away with his nakedness. He has a vaguely \"phwoar\" look on his face and is even making a thumbs-up-for-the lads sign (while Gisele is wearing clothes like a \"nice girl\", a mystery - until, it is implied, Robbie has the pleasure of discovering her). </p> <p>The problem is that there is no female equivalent of the naked Robbie Williams, of the Bruce Webber hunk who's spent all day working on an oil rig. There is no mainstream female aesthetic that allows a woman to look au naturel without immediately becoming sexualised. You could also say that Mel B is just helping to prop up a system whereby famous women can get on only by looking passive or \"bad\" - it's all the same thing in the soft porn context - and taking their clothes off. Whether you are covered in bees or a skimpy bikini, it's all much of a muchness. </p> <p> Mel B is obviously upset because she feels she has lost control of her image. Nor is she the first to make a fuss about photographic liberties being taken with their smalls. Melanie Sykes was less than amused earlier this year when her bikini bottom vanished after a cover shoot for Maxim magazine, while Kylie Minogue insisted that her thong disappeared between posing and publication in GQ. But it is hard to stand up for Mel B, like it used to be hard to stand up for Naomi Campbell - though I used to try because it is harder to be a black woman than a white one. Both Naomi and Mel are perceived as stroppy and this is not unconnected to the fact of their colour. Like being a lesbian, nobody really cares until you get successful and then they care. Then they hate you. </p> <p>So why fret about the absence of something that was barely there in the first place? Does the bees thing make it a porn image whereas a Gucci bikini would have made it classy? On paper, yes, there's a difference, although my view is that theyshould all wake up and smell the coffee if they choose to be in that mainstream arena. The Greenham Common women were much more interesting and worthwhile. </p> <p>Perhaps the real question is: what's with all this no-clothes \"fashion\"? We seem to be in a real post-clothes moment and, according to last week's New York fashion shows, we're all going to be wearing 24-hour bikinis next summer. But before everyone starts stripping off, a word of advice: a good body is the best fashion accessory of all but clothes are important, too. It is often only the thought of what the person was wearing before they took their clothes off that gets you through the night.</p>",
  "Andrew Clements is foaming at the mouth because surtitles are to be provided for an opera sung in English (Incomprehensible, September 23). <p>Yet a visit to the cinema these days presents quite an aural challenge - and opera sung in our native tongue is more difficult. Surtitles have increased my enjoyment of opera and for Mr Clements to suggest it will become \"museum art of a vacuous kind\" as a result of their use is ludicrous. </p> <p>Why should he mind? Many musical people follow instrumental works with a score on their knee. Does this transform the performances to mere \"engaging background music\"? <br><b>Gavin Bullock </b><br> Winchester<br><a href=\"mailto:gavin.bullock@dial.pipex.com\">gavin.bullock@dial.pipex.com</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 So Andrew Clements is outraged at the use of surtitles for an opera sung in English. This \"bizarre decision\" helps the one in seven of us who have a hearing loss and who are unable to make out lyrics in whatever language they are sung. Does he really find surtitles so intrusive that he would deny someone with a hearing disability the opportunity to enjoy opera? <br><b> Leigh Donnison </b><br> Leighton Buzzard, Beds </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 The last time I saw Billy Budd, a few years ago in Newcastle, again with the charismatic Simon Keenlyside as Billy, I was bowled over by the music but couldn't follow the words in the choruses and ensembles. </p> <p>This time I was able to refer when necessary to the non- intrusive screen which those in the side of the stalls circle were given to view the surtitles, and this enhanced my enjoyment of the whole opera. During the monologues and other solos I had no need of the surtitles and was able to ignore them. <br><b> Drusilla Calvert </b><br> London<br><a href=\"mailto:d.calvert@macrex.com\">d.calvert@macrex.com</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Clements's outrage is misplaced. Like him, I attended Billy Budd. Unlike him, I was glad of the surtitles when I was unable to understand the English that was being sung. </p> <p>My ire is reserved for the people who chose surtitling over the system available at the Metropolitan in New York. There, both Mr Clements and I would be satisfied - our differing needs served by an individual monitor mounted in the seatback in front of us. Mine would be on, his off. <br><b> Hywel Sims</b><br> London<br><a href=\"mailto:HandR@limehouse62. freeserve.co.uk\">HandR@limehouse62. freeserve.co.uk</a></p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Clements's note of despair over the use of surtitles is well taken and yet another sign of a dumbing down in the arts in the UK. I believe it was the Italians who started this practice at La Scala. We watch opera from Italy on satellite TV now and again. Even in this medium, where the words are perfectly clear, we get subtitles on the screen despite the libretto being in the vernacular. <br><b>Reg Williamson</b> <br>Kidsgrove, Staffs <br><a href=\"mailto:regwilliamson@beeb.net\">regwilliamson@beeb.net</a> </p>",
  "In his piece on the case of the conjoined twins, Alexander McCall Smith (Tough justice, September 23) rightly asks Archbishop Murphy O'Connor what he would do if he could save only one of two people dangling from a rope below his balloon. <p>This made me think of a case we were given in law school, concerning two shipwrecked people. One was holding on to a plank and the other swimming towards it. The plank would not keep two people afloat, so the one who had reached the plank first pushed back the other, who subsequently drowned. The survivor was acquitted. </p> <p>The law recognises that a person who is in the position of having a reasonable chance to survive cannot be expected to give up his life to save another or to share the fate of death. </p> <p>I think this would convince most people if they try to put themselves into the position of Jodie. As for the church leaders who are prepared to accept that two die where one could be saved, their moral credibility has once more been diminished. <br><b>Christian Wisskirchen </b><br> London </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Lord Justice Ward appears to state that one of the factors that entered into his decision in the case of the conjoined twins was an assessment that, without Mary, Jodie would be able to live a \"fairly normal\" life. If she was not a \"bright, alert baby\" would the decision have been a different one? </p> <p>On the other hand, he describes Mary \"parasitic\" and \"sucking the life-blood\" of her sister. I feel sure that language like this would not have been used if Mary did not have severe brain damage. <br><b> Jennifer Hoskins</b><br> Reading, Berks </p>"
