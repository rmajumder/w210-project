  "<p>Leicester are still hoping not to go to Belgrade for their Uefa Cup second leg on Thursday week against Red Star. Uefa, having moved the tie to precede Yugoslavia's presidential election, requires written assurances of players' safety from the authorities by tomorrow. Meanwhile Leicester prepared for Thursday's home leg with a win that keeps them level on points with Manchester United on top of the table. </p> <p>United have scored 13 goals, Leicester four and conceded only one, a last-minute penalty. Tim Flowers said at the weekend the trip to Belgrade was \"not cast-iron yet\". His goalkeeping is just that. A first-half, double parry from 12 yards, then three was spectacular. Gerry Taggart, who landed him in it, more than made up for it with his second-half header from a corner to settle the issue. </p> <p>Leicester's defence is well built about Matt Elliott but, where United score freely, the Foxes peter out. Ade Akinbiyi is lightning without the strike; Darren Eadie is more comfortable wide; and Stan Collymore, short of match fitness, had his promised 45 minutes - but half a loafer is worse than nothing. Tony Cottee, last season's top scorer, was last night released to Norwich. </p> <p>So far City have got away with this, wasting the service of Neil Lennon and Muzzy Izzet. They are alarmingly dependent on these two, neither fully fit, for midfield control. When both had been replaced, after the goal, the Saints raised a siege, coincident also with James Beattie's arrival for Uwe R\u00f6sler. Glenn Hoddle persists with R\u00f6sler as line leader in a 4-3-2-1 formation. Beattie's movement might give it point and bring Marian Pahars and Hassan Kachloul more encouragement. </p> <p>Unusually for opposing managers Hoddle and Peter Taylor, friends for 20 years and recent England allies, had dinner together on Friday. Within 20 hours the pupil Taylor, given his chance with the Under-21s by Hoddle, had had his master tactically for breakfast. Sometimes Hoddle seems in danger of vanishing up his own theories. </p> <p>Both are exponents of the so-called \"beautiful game\", a term apparently coined by people who still refer to the Dome as \"the attraction\". This was less beautiful than frustrating because so many patient attacks ended with mindless or incompetent centres. How can two such thinking managers not attend better to the end product? </p> <p>Taylor may have the greater streak of realism and to City's famous spirit he has harnessed a belief in individual ability. Hoddle was impressed. \"I think he's very approachable and he switches on the right head to cope with different circumstances at the right time,\" he said. At present Elliott is the one like Cerberus and, as for Hoddle, it is a case of \"Heads you win, tails I lose\". </p> <p>At times his sayings rival those of Colin Murphy, City's football co-ordinator, whose programme notes as manager of Lincoln were a legend of highfalutin obscurity. Flowers said hopefully that Murphy had been sent to Belgrade to help sort things out. Presumably his Serbo-Croat is more intelligible than his English.</p>",
  "<p>Derby County were given a taste of their own medicine yesterday and did not find it to their liking. After nurturing a talent for improbable feats of escapology Jim Smith's team - Houdini FC, he has taken to calling them - found the task of protecting a two-goal lead beyond their limited means. </p> <p>Having created what should have been a winning margin through first-half goals from Malcolm Christie and Simo Valakari, the Premiership's comeback kings were dethroned by goals from Claus Jensen and Jonatan Johansson in the space of three second-half minutes. </p> <p>It was the eighth time this season a side has recovered from being two goals down or worse in the Premiership and by the end Derby's supporters could be excused for being overcome by a sense of giddiness. </p> <p>Smith's team have been the main players in the comeback stakes this season, having salvaged draws from being three down against Middlesbrough and two down to Everton and Southampton. This time they were to finish on the receiving end. \"The script was the wrong way around,\" wheezed the Charlton manager Alan Curbishley. </p> <p>Charlton were fortunate to survive a late penalty appeal but they were good value for their draw during a match in which the case for both defences was indefensible. </p> <p>Derby's breakthrough came in the seventh minute courtesy of Christie's third goal since beginning his season belatedly as a second-half substitute against Middlesbrough last Wednesday. </p> <p>Bjorn Otto Bragstad hoofed the ball into Charlton's penalty area and, when the ball fell, Christie was the only player to react, taking one touch to control the ball and another to drive a left-foot shot into the far corner of Dean Kiely's goal. Such was the ponderous inactivity of Charlton's defenders it all seemed to have happened in slow motion. </p> <p>If that was route-one stuff, Derby's second came with frills attached, Valakari starting and finishing an intricate move with a left-foot drive from the edge of the penalty area. </p> <p>Charlton's frustration was palpable. For most of the opening 45 minutes they had produced the more cultured football only to be let down by some feeble finishing. But in the second half they found their range, with the ubiquitous Johansson flourishing and their midfielders full of zestful running. </p> <p>Johannson created Charlton's first with his sense of awareness, dragging the ball back for Claus Jensen to score from eight yards after a sparkling counter-attack stemming from a Derby corner. </p> <p>With the inquest ongoing in the home defence, Johansson then ran on to a long bouncing ball, dinked it over the oncoming goalkeeper Mart Poom and finished into an empty goal. \"Amateur goals,\" bemoaned Smith. </p> <p>At that point Charlton looked the more likely victors but it was Derby's players who left the field harbouring a burning sense of injustice. With 10 minutes remaining Mark Kinsella upended Stefano Eranio in the penalty area but the referee Peter Jones inexplicably waved aside the appeals before booking Eranio for protesting. </p> <p>If Kinsella was embarrassed, Jones should be humiliated. Referees get \u00a3900 for officiating Premiership matches, which is an awful lot of money for misjudgments such as this. </p> <p>Curbishley is clearly an alum nus of the Ars\u00e8ne Wenger school of management, stating he \"had not seen the incident\", but Smith, predictably, had. \"If you don't give a penalty for that you shouldn't be refereeing,\" he said. \"The referee was so close to the foul he could have made the tackle himself. It was too obvious for words.\" </p> <p>To compound Derby's dismay, 22,310 was the lowest league attendance since Pride Park was opened four seasons ago. It was a bad day all round.</p>",
  "As New Labour approached mid-term in government, a group of women began meeting to ask some awkward questions. Why had the triumph of 100 women in parliament become a sorry joke? Why had Downing Street begun to feel like an exclusive boys' club? Why had feminism become a dirty word, even with the newly appointed Minister for Women? <p>Most of us were supporters of New Labour and a few were Labour MPs. But we feared that, now the party was in government, it had lost the plot as far as women were concerned. Last week's announcement by Mo Mowlam that she is quitting politics seems to justify our concerns that the government has been squandering its female assets. </p> <p>If New Labour wanted to consolidate its gains, we believed, it would have to become more gender-aware and egalitarian in its own internal practices as well as in its politics. </p> <p>Out of those meetings came a book, New Gender Agenda, published today by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), the Fawcett Society and the Fabian Society in which prominent figures (male and female) - in politics, academia and journalism call for a more constructive engagement between government and feminism, and explore the practical implications as we approach the next election. </p> <p>Today's Mori poll, commissioned by IPPR, confirms two of the book's key themes. The first is that, contrary to received wisdom in Labour's higher echelons, feminism is in tune, not out of step, with today's electorate. Major issues on which feminists have long campaigned - for childcare and an equal voice in politics - are considered important by, respectively, 88 and 86% of Mori's respondents. The second theme is that women are less likely than men to trust the government to deliver on the issues that affect them most. Only 52% say they are confident that Labour will allow women politicians an equal say . </p> <p>Deborah Mattinson, a leading authority on opinion research, reminds us that women have always been more likely to vote Conservative, tending to see Labour as masculine and old-fashioned. They switched to Labour in 1997 because they liked Blair's fresh style and the influx of women MPs. But their support is tentative and conditional. If they see signs of the party reverting to \"business as usual\", they will swiftly lose faith. The hostile reception of the Women's Institute to Tony Blair at their conference this summer was a sign of how fast and steep his fall from grace might be. An ICM poll last July showed that Labour's lead among women voters aged 18-35 had plummeted from a 40-point lead over the Conservatives in early 1999 to 21 points. </p> <p>If Blair and the party's power- brokers want to stop the gender gap from opening up again, they must signal - strongly - their confidence in women MPs and ministers as a voice for women. And they must welcome a dialogue with them about gender and equal opportunity. Labour entered government in a fearful and embattled frame of mind: the new leaders in Downing Street had been wholly preoccupied by the need to outflank the Tories in marginal constituencies and appease the right-wing press. They had no appetite for difference or debate and, wherever possible, tried to suppress dissent. This was bad news for the women in parliament, who were certainly different and a threat to the status quo. </p> <p>The Guardian's political correspondent Lucy Ward tracked the journey of \"Blair's babes\" from triumph to ignominy. First, expectations and plaudits were heaped upon them. Within weeks, they were accused of failing to match up to those early, inflated hopes and routinely ridiculed in the media. In response, they sought safety in party loyalty and resisted any common identification with women. Far from defending or supporting the women MPs, \"Blair's boys\" added their voices - more or less overtly - to the chorus of disdain. They made use of strict party discipline to control any remaining assertiveness. No MP or adviser could take the side of the women against the leadership without kissing goodbye to her political career. As a result of all this, the women failed to combine forces to resist the first thing the government did that was seen as an attack - the cut in lone parent benefit. Any capacity they may have had to change the culture of politics and champion women's issues, was effectively undermined. </p> <p>Yet wasn't New Labour shooting itself in the foot? As Anne Phillips, director of the Gender Institute at the London School of Economics, points out, if a political party selects female candidates by special measures to increase the numbers of women in parliament, it must surely believe they can more effectively represent women's interests. It makes no sense to insist that, once the women are elected, party discipline trumps gender solidarity every time there is a difference of opinion. </p> <p>What the men do not realise, apparently, is how much they depend on women leaders and activists inside the party to drive forward the women's agenda, to transform the party's image and practice, and so to consolidate its appeal to female voters. Experience suggests that men show little aptitude for the task and are unlikely to give it the priority it deserves. But this is not a job for yes-women. It takes strong, free-thinking characters with enough courage to buck the trend and speak their minds. Just the sort who tend to have feminist leanings. And just the sort least welcomed by men who are transfixed by middle England and the Daily Mail. </p> <p>Only in Scotland and Wales have the new democratic institutions given women room to breathe. Wendy Alexander, the high-flying Minister for Communities in the new Scottish parliament where women have 37% of seats, describes how women have driven forward a new approach to governance and a new ordering of political priorities. </p> <p>In Wales, where women won 40% of assembly seats, assembly member Val Fedl comments that the presence of so many women is also changing the behaviour of men. \"It gives legitimacy to those men that do want to work in a way that allows for co-operation and collaboration, and places less emphasis on status and more on outcomes.\" </p> <p>In both these instances, Labour had driven up the numbers of women by selecting one male and one female candidate in \"twinned\" constituencies. Westminster now looks rather laggardly, with women in only 18% of seats. And the prospects are poor. New Labour has ditched its strategy of all-women shortlists, which helped swell the numbers at Westminster in 1997. Since then a large majority of constituencies with seats to fill have chosen men. What's more, the numbers of women on local councils - an important training ground - remains pitifully low. Fawcett Society director Mary-Ann Stephenson reports that only one in four councillors is female, and that many are put off by the poor quality of local representation, which is largely due to the fact that very few people - male or female - want to stand for election. </p> <p>As many of the contributors observe, the main point of getting more women elected, locally or nationally, is in order to make a better job of meeting women's needs and improving their lives. New Labour has already made some progress, especially in helping women into paid employment. Several authors argue that it must now - urgently - do more to tackle the problems of combining work and family. Paid parental leave for men and women would be a good start. The point is not just to help women do the \"juggling\" but, first, to acknowledge that caring is a vital contribution to the economy and, second, to extend genuine choices to men and women about how they use their time. </p> <p>Patricia Hewitt, minister of state at the Department of Trade and Industry, observes that \"in the new economy, social and economic policy are no longer separate\"; any government that wants \"to succeed in the knowledge economy must open up opportunities to women and men, challenge the segregation of roles in both the workplace and the home.\" Harriet Harman, former secretary of state for social security and Minister for Women, points out that seven departments of state have an involvement in work and family issues: \"There is no clear departmental lead, and for none of them is work and family at the top of the agenda.\" Bolton MP Ruth Kelly argues that: \"If choice is to be a reality, and women's caring role to be properly valued by society, the caring role needs to be explicitly recognised and policy geared to that end.\" </p> <p>In the final essay, Ian Christie and Michael Jacobs of the Fabian Society suggest that new political territory is being carved out: \"A new politics of quality of life gives fresh energy to an old idea associated with environmentalism and feminism - that the 'personal is political' - and opens up new issues where these movements can form alliances.\" It recognises the importance of collective action to defend and promote our individual and shared interests, and gives new prominence to gender and diversity, time use and sustainable development. </p> <p>The New Labour leadership is cer tainly aware that the political ground is shifting and wants to lead the process of change. The \"Third Way\" discourse is Blair's attempt to identify a distinctive approach and agenda. So far it has been crafted almost exclusively by white males and reflects their priorities - missing the chance to learn from a wider range of experience and to catch the tides of change. New Labour's elite must understand that the ideas and perspectives that women can bring to the party are not just a set of demands to be mollified by the occasional gesture, but are a key to the continuing process of political renewal. </p> <p>\u0095 New Gender Agenda, edited by Anna Coote, is published today by the Institute for Public Policy Research, the Fawcett Society and the Fabian Society, price \u00a310.95.

  "<p>A US astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut drifted out of space shuttle Atlantis Monday, making a successful climb up the international space station that was more spacehike than spacewalk. </p> <p>Edward Lu and Yuri Malenchenko made the gruelling ascent to lay cable and install a boom for a navigation unit on the exterior of the 140-foot station during their 6 hour, 14 minute spacewalk. They carried the bundled cables on their backs, along with the boom and their tools. </p> <p>The spacewalkers ventured an astounding 110 feet from Atlantis' cargo bay, where the space station had been anchored for the past day. It was the farthest distance any Nasa spacewalker had ventured while tethered. </p> <p>\"Got a great view back at the nose of the shuttle,\" said Lu, who was on his first spacewalk. His partner performed spacewalks while living aboard Russia's Mir space station. </p> <p>The spacewalk official inside Mission Control, Mike Hess, likened the foray to working on the 11th story of a 13-story building - with a much better view, 230 miles (370 kilometres) above Earth. </p> <p>The work went flawlessly, ending 16 minutes ahead of schedule even with the addition of a brief task, the manual extension of a docking target that didn't deploy properly and was in the astronauts' way. Ordinarily, Nasa has fast-working spacewalkers tackle chores scheduled for later missions; but Lu and Malenchenko did not have to perform any get-ahead tasks. </p> <p>\"There wasn't really anything else to do on the space station and won't be, really, until the next crew gets up there,\" Hess said. </p> <p>To get to the top of the towering station, Lu and Malenchenko first took a 40-foot ride on the shuttle robot arm. Then they ascended hand over hand like rock climbers, clipping and unclipping their tethers like climbing ropes as they moved up. </p> <p>It was deliberate travel, slowed by a multitude of obstructions like antennas and docking targets. Astronaut Daniel Burbank, watching from inside the cockpit, guided Lu and Malenchenko up the stack. </p> <p>\"Watch your head,\" Burbank ordered. \"Don't move right. Bring your legs straight up... Watch your right foot. Put your feet up.\" </p> <p>The two men needed to scale the Russian service module Zvezda to erect a 6-foot boom for a compass and to install nine power, data and television cables between it and the other Russian module, Zarya. </p> <p>Russia installed the compass, which measures Earth's magnetic field, too close to Zvezda's metal hull, knocking the instrument's readings off. Nasa had asked from the start that the compass, called a magnetometer, be equipped with an extendable boom, but the Russian space program declined because of a lack of money, Hess said. </p> <p>Nasa discovered another small problem on Zvezda on Monday: a jammed solar panel on one of its wings. The panel did not unfold following launch of the module, and Nasa may have to fix the problem on a later visit. </p> <p>Atlantis linked up with the station as the spacecraft soared above Kazakhstan on Sunday, ending a two-day chase complicated slightly by a failed navigation device aboard the shuttle. Atlantis was going to take advantage of the linkup and give the station an orbital boost of about 3 miles (5 kilometers) Monday. </p> <p>The seven astronauts and cosmonauts will enter the complex Tuesday to haul in thousands of pounds of supplies for the first residents, due in November. </p> <p>At the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, meanwhile, Nasa moved space shuttle Discovery to the launch pad for an October 5 lift-off on a station-assembly mission.</p>",
  "There has been much speculation as to how badly damaged is the career of Robert Downey Jr after drugs offences took him to the slammer last year. He has just emerged from prison to take up the part of the new love interest for Ally McBeal in the television series. This has caused some of the nation's drug warriors to raise eyebrows and wonder what sort of a message it sends to young people etc etc that a chap can walk straight into a plum part as though nothing had happened. <p>Downey, who was jailed for parole violations following an initial cocaine, heroin and firearm arrest in 1996, has sensibly kept a low profile since his release at a time when 400,000 people are now incarcerated in American jails for drugs offences, a total higher than the entire European prison population. Few actors want to be too publicly associated with drugs, although Woody Harrelson has been remarkably outspoken on the issue of the legalisation of marijuana and so far this does not seem to have adversely affected his career. </p> <p>The old received wisdom has been that any association with drugs meant that the career of the user suffered and penance had to be done before they could emerge as a star once more. But one of the most famous drugs busts in Hollywood history produced the opposite effect. </p> <p>When Robert Mitchum was arrested with a lighted reefer he had been handed at a party in Laurel Canyon in 1949, it was widely predicted that his career would come to a premature end. Time magazine wrote a suitably breathless account of Mitchum's arrest: \"The most self-conscious city of a self-conscious nation was in for a first-rate scandal and it hated and feared every minute of it . . . Hollywood's laboriously contrived self-portrait was once again in danger of looking like a comic strip - and an ugly one.\" Time helpfully explained that marijuana was \"said to produce a state of exhilaration\". (The shade of purple may have changed slightly but the prose on drugs is still the same today. Interestingly, the press were tipped off about the bust before it had happened. Some things don't change.) </p> <p>But as Otto Friedrich recorded in his entertaining book, City of Nets, about Hollywood in the 40s, Mitchum's 50 days inside - having got 10 off for good behaviour - did him little harm in the industry. When RKO nervously released the film Rachel and the Stranger - in which Mitchum starred - not long after his own release, it became number one in box office takings across the country. Friedrich concluded: \"Mitchum, who was supposed to go to prison and suffer, emerged as a kind of folk hero, still cynical, laconic, sexy and quite unreformed by his incarceration.\" Perhaps the same will happen for R Downey Jr. </p> <p><b>Danger capital of the US</b></p> <p> Win some, lose some. On the same day that it was announced that Houston had overtaken Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in the United States, came news from Gallup that LA was regarded as the most dangerous city in which to work or live in the whole of the US. A whopping 67% of middle America believes that it is a frightening and lawless place, even more so than Miami and New York. A genial Gallup spokesman said that most of the people who believed this had probably never been to LA but had seen a lot of films in which violence and mayhem is taking place in the city. For the record, Seattle is still regarded as the safest large city, despite the fact that it was laid waste by the armies of anti-corporatism last November. </p> <p>There was much pooh-poohing here of this suggestion that LA was the next step down from Medellin in terms of violence and danger, but a report published this week on morale within the LAPD gives some credence to it. Officers who were interviewed said that they were now so worried about disciplinary proceedings that they spent much of their time trying to avoid crime by aimlessly cruising the city. They also said that they routinely falsified their whereabouts when out on patrol so that they did not have to respond to calls for help, fearing that they would be disciplined if their response time was too slow. So perhaps all those worried mid-westerners have some cause for alarm after all. </p> <p>\u0095 Los Angeles often claims to be the first home of the gay rights movement in the US, so there was amazement when two young lesbians were evicted last month from Dodger stadium during a baseball game for kissing each other. Not surprisingly the incident provoked a storm and the stadium has now duly relented. </p> <p>A humble apology was issued. The two women were invited back as guests of honour and the night was declared a special gay and lesbian event. The two were feted as celebrities. One trusts that if the same thing happened at, say, Chelsea, there would be a similar response. The eviction and accompanying anger from fans has clearly had an effect on the Dodgers team, who are having their worst run of the season.</p> <p> \u0095 I can't help it. The lead item on the local television news last night was that it had rained yesterday. Certainly, the last time I can remember anything wet coming from the sky was March so it was big news - I have had to check the car manuals to see where the windscreen wipers are. A man who had been in the rain was interviewed reverently by a local news reporter. </p> <p> \u0095 Student loans have always been as much of an issue here as in the UK, but usually students facing heavy debts find conventional means of trying to deal with them. Last week, however, one of them clearly felt that there was only one solution. A young man called Hoang Tran who said that he was desperate to repay his student loans walked into the local Bank of America in the Little Saigon area of the city and took 20 customers hostage. He fired a shot at the ceiling and told the customers that his backpack contained a bomb and he was going to blow the place up. Eventually he tearfully surrendered. </p> <p>Tran, who surrendered without anyone being injured, will no longer need to worry about those loans as he will become one of the statistics that show that members of minority groups in California are three times more likely to spend their youthful years in prison than in universities.</p>",

I have changed my mind about the subject of my talk and I am going to take a broad topic of equality and public service which belong to sociology and also to economics and to political science, so I am going to have to cross boundaries.

It was already all there in Mr Attlee's head, in the head of Mr Morrison as Chairman of the Policy Committee, and in my younger one. All I had to do was to tune in to the spirit of the times as well as add Beveridge and Keynes to Keir Hardie. Attlee is distant history and it would not be worth recalling were there no lessons to be learned for the present. After all this time - 55 years is a long time in politics - is anything at all from it still relevant?</p> <p><b>The two principles</b> </p> <p>No on the detail. But on two of its principles, perhaps yes. The first principle was equity in the distribution of incomes; the second was the importance of public service. I shall try to deal with each of them in turn.</p> <p><b>Golden Age</b> </p> <p>1945 was followed by what has been called the Golden Age, an age of the mixed economy, an admittedly sometimes faltering economy subject to stop-go but in which there was full employment without inflation. There was also secular growth in the economy. And - the specifically socialist contribution to the mix - as Tony Crosland famously said, socialism is about equality - there was a relatively equal society. It was a confident society with belief in the future in which there was a baby boom - no fear then of a population decline - and to start with it was led from the front by a government which made the most of its advantages. Generally, they widened the span of concern for the wellbeing of others and tried to make society more inclusive of the poor and the distressed, the disabled and the sick, the children and the elderly who cannot support themselves.</p> <p><b>Inequality worsened</b> </p> <p>Since then in more recent years growing inequality has befallen the country and some other countries too. Some of the main facts have been brought together by Professor Atkinson in his WIDER lecture for the United Nations University (AB Atkinson, 'Is Rising Equality Inevitable? A Critique of the Transatlantic Consensus', November 1999), both about the tendencies in a market economy for the poor to get poorer and the rich richer. The shift has coincided, not coincidentally, with moves to the Right in politics and a masochistic rush on the part of governments to prostrate themselves before market forces.</p> <p>There is not much dispute about inequality having got more severe. The dispute centres on what can be done about it, or even (with the well-groomed men who have done so well for themselves always ready to say no, it can't) whether anything can be done about it. The question is whether we can show that growing inequality, though it stems from a world that is chasing greed with abandoned relish, is neither inevitable nor desirable.</p> <p>There are multiple causes of the inequality, interacting in multiple ways. In Atkinson's interpretation, which has the United States and the United Kingdom at its core, the inequality is put down to two main causes, changes in technology and changes in the pattern of international trade and in Britain these were helped to achieve their effects by a series of political decisions during the Thatcher regime.</p> <p><b>Technology</b> </p> <p>Technological change is apt to increase unemployment in the short run whenever it raises productivity and enables goods and services to be produced more efficiently with less labour. The advances in automation and, especially in information technology, have been at the expense of unskilled workers with little education. The more unemployment, the more the downward pressure on wages from people desperate for work. Workers no longer have as much protection from undercutting as they used to have from trade unions or from industrial accidents for that matter. In the British case, Mrs Thatcher attacked the unions by legislation and on the streets. After a quasi-military mobilisation of force in the miners' strike the National Union of Mineworkers was destroyed and the bargaining power of that union, and of unions generally, was weakened, and the pressure on wages reinforced.</p> <p>The poor, including pensioners, were also attacked by indexing benefits to prices instead of wages. Since prices have not generally risen as much as wages, the poor who are not working have been the ones who have been made to suffer. This deprivation for the poor has persisted right up to the present, well into the term of office of the new Labour Government. A small step has been taken in the right direction with the Minimum Income Guarantee for low-income pensioners which is to be earnings-linked but since it is means-tested the take-up will be only partial. In any case the old principle needs to be restored generally, not just for a particular benefit like that.</p> <p><b>Patterns of trade</b> </p> <p>The same core countries (more or less the G7) dominate world commerce as much as they did a century ago. But international trade has been more under the control of multinational corporations and the new trading blocs while it has also been generally liberalised, at least up till the threatened collapse of the World Trade Organisation at Seattle. Within the more global economy, the competition from newly industrialised countries has cut most sharply at the bargaining power of unskilled workers. Theirs are the jobs lost to the cheaper labour abroad and theirs the wages put under threat as the products of labour-intensive industries have been outsourced to India or Taiwan, Indonesia or China or wherever. Inequality between wage-earners in poorer countries and richer may have diminished a little as a result. That is hardly consolation to people on low wages or no wages at all in Britain. If changes in technology and world trade have accentuated inequality, where does that leave us in Britain? Are we caught up in a global economy which we have no choice about being in and cannot escape from even if we wanted to?</p> <p><b>From the bottom up</b> </p> <p>The government is certainly not powerless. It can cushion the effect of the competition, even if it cannot damp it right down and does not want to anyway. Better training needs to be provided for youngsters and others who cannot get into jobs at all, lacking the skills which employers require. This the government has done something about.</p> <p>The government can also support the wages of the low paid which it has done with the Working Families Tax Credit. Their take-home pay is larger than it would otherwise be. This has the effect of easing the poverty trap. The Tax Credit reduces the extent to which some people are better-off on benefit than they are if they take jobs at low wages. The government can also enforce a Minimum Wage, as Labour is doing and Conservatives refused to do.</p> <p>Even if inequality increases when low wages are under such pressure from technology and overseas competition, the welfare system is the more important influence on the lot of the poor. In the Golden Age transfer from the better-off to the less well-off and the taxation which funded the transfers by and large had the intended redistributive effect. But from 1984 onwards, quite apart from globalisation, a major shift in policy aggravated inequality. Direct taxation of income is 'progressive': those with higher incomes pay more in tax. Indirect taxation on goods and services in the form of VAT and other taxes is regressive. For the less well-off the indirect taxes represent a larger proportion of their lower incomes.</p> <p>From 1984 on inequality was promoted quite deliberately by a move from progressive income taxes to regressive indirect taxes and by cutting back on benefits through the new indexation and in other ways. The tools were there and they could be used to ill effect. They can also be used to good effect, not to foster inequality but to reduce it by raising income taxes and reducing indirect taxes.</p> <p>In its first two years in office the new government stuck to Conservative spending limits and carried through the cut in the single parent benefit inherited from the Conservatives. Under Labour all-round poverty actually increased. Since then the move has been in the right direction (small 'r'), to help children, for example, who have the best case of all. 'When poverty strikes a family, the youngest members become its most innocent and vulnerable victims. Since a good start in life - especially in the first few months - is critical to the physical, intellectual and emotional development of every individual, poverty in early childhood can prove to be a handicap for life.' (UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund), 'Poverty Reduction Begins with Children', March 2000).</p> <p>Labour now looks like bringing 1.4 million children out of poverty by 2002. The goal is to end child poverty in 20 years. That is fine. But it does seem a very long time to wait. Expected progress is too slow. When (or if) the first 2002 target is reached, child poverty will still be nearly twice as high as when a Labour government was last in office in 1979. There is a long way to go before what was lost is recouped. Child poverty rose from 1.4 million in 1968 to 4.4 million in 1997. Another UNICEF Report on the 23 richest nations in the world showed that in the child poverty league the UK was the fourth worst in the industrialised world.</p> <p>It is the same story with the New Deal training programme. If low levels of skill are partly responsible for unemployment, low wages and the consequent inequality, it makes the best of sense to put a large effort into training and even more into schooling at younger ages when basic attitudes to learning are established. The New Deal needs to be much enlarged, especially for older people.</p> <p><b>Middle-age trap</b> </p> <p>An incredible 2,600,000 people over 50 but under retirement age have not been in Work (The Annual Abstract of Statistics, 1999, Table 7.16). Many of them are also caught in a painful middle-age trap. Employers without compassion for their employees, but a lot for their own money, often cannot resist sacking older employees when they are cutting back on the size of their workforces. If occupational pensions are linked to salaries employers can save money by sacking senior employees. The excuse, implicit if not explicit, is that people are 'too old at 50', if not at 40. It is even worse for people who have no such pension. Their state pension is a long way off and when it comes it is liable to be reduced anyway because full National Insurance Contributions have not been paid.</p> <p>Labour promised legislation against age discrimination which could have come down heavily on employers who discriminate in this way; but there has been no hint of it so far, not in the present parliament anyway. The introduction of the New Deal 50-Plus has been a start, at least in giving a little support for people of this age who can get work. But it is on much too small a scale; the middle-age trap is still there, often leaving people in dire poverty when their unemployment benefit and redundancy benefits are exhausted, and with no relief in sight.</p> <p>The conclusion so far is that the global economy has not (as the EU has not) removed the ability of governments to aid the poorest and the poor. It can do so without resorting to trade protectionism. It would be no solution to block cheap imports; it would invite other countries to block British exports and those of our industrialised trading partners in Europe and elsewhere. But the social effects, both of changes in technology at home and changes in the nature of competition from abroad, can, and need to be, countered by lifting up the benefits for the poor and doing everything possible to raise skill levels.</p> <p><b>Top down</b> </p> <p>So something has been done, and more promised, to raise the bottom. But very little at the top end where rising relative wages have been the main source of growing inequality. The richer have not been called on to make sacrifices themselves. To judge from what ministers say, poverty is not a taboo word but equality is, and redistribution nearly so. Ministers have concentrated on those who have little in the way of income and not much of anything in the way of wealth, and almost entirely failed to tackle those with plenty of both. Inequality has therefore been added to even more by ballooning out at the top than by squeezing in at the bottom.</p> <p>The display of self interest in a naked form has not exactly added to social cohesion or provided a good example when appeals are made for wage restraint. The people at the bottom may be getting a few pounds more for themselves and their children but what is going on at the top can only add to their sense of injustice. In elections the poor have one vote each, just like any rich person; in the economy each rich person counts for much more.</p> <p>We seem to be into a new golden age, not for equality but for booty. The latest lot of figures has been collected in a survey for the Guardian. The pay of Britain*s top businessmen went up by 16.5% in 1999, four times the average wage Increase. The increase was often from an already elevated base. More than 110 senior executives (including one woman) received more than \u00a31m pa in basic income without counting in share options with their tax advantages. Some basic income!</p> <p>We in Britain have not yet got to the point where in recent years the wealthy have fattened themselves up (literally - obesity is a national problem in USA) as much as across the Atlantic. But the UK is on the way. Top salaries and benefits are much higher than they were for top people of many different sorts with others at many different lower levels taking their lead from the top. In these circumstances the government clearly needs to act to moderate a further cranking up of inequality.</p> <p><b>Supertax</b> </p> <p>It was a good start when it came to power with a pledge to tax the windfall profits of utilities. This turned out to be a one-off when it need not have been. There have been many other windfall profits - by banks, for instance - and even more windfall gains to people like those senior executives. If the government took action it could be following precedent. The Liberal government of 1905 not only benefited the poor with the Pensions Act of 1908 and the National Insurance Act of 1911 but was spirited enough to call on wealthier people to make their contribution to the cost of rearmament and also of the reform by introducing the first Supertax in Lloyd George's 'People's Budget' of 1909.</p> <p>So far the stance of government towards business more generally could hardly have been more favourable than it has been, yielding on this score very little or anything to Thatcher or Major. The values of private enterprise and businessmen have become the darlings of government instead of trade unionism and the union leaders who were once served by Harold Wilson with beer and sandwiches at No.10. The government has behaved as though it is a government of business. The favour for private enterprise has been the counterpart of the disfavour for public ownership and the public services. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,367279,00.html\">Part two: the old notion of public service</a></p>",
  "I now come to the second principle underlying Let Us Face The Future. The old notion of public service was still very much in evidence at the time of the Attlee government. The ideal was that in the good society every citizen contributes to the wellbeing of the city not because they want some special gains out of it for themselves as individuals but because they love the city. <p>The ideal was of public service in voluntary work and, above all, in the public services like local government or essential services such as health or education, water or electricity, gas, coal or railways; not totally altruistic, being paid for it certainly, but without monetary gain as a main motive. The firmness of principle was most evident in the civil and military services and in the professions also upholding an ethic of conduct which was in different degrees shared by people working in the publicly owned industries.</p> <p>Bad public service or not, the popular view has it that as an offset to all its positive achievements the Attlee government failed in one important respect - in its attempt to run some industries as public services. Public ownership in one of its manifestations - in the health industry - was and is an exception to the general view; but then the policy was much less doctrinaire than in the other nationalised industries, with considerable scope left in the NHS for private enterprise within it.</p> <p>Public ownership in manufacturing has been the chief butt of criticism. But in my view (no doubt biased) the failure was not in the notion of public ownership itself, so much as in the way it was done. It had only been done once before 1945, which was when Herbert Morrison set up as a public corporation the London Passenger Transport Board during the Labour Government of 1929-31. The model was seized on immediately after 1945, whether it was appropriate or not.</p> <p>The weakness of the public corporation was that it was so much a creature of government. 'The economic purpose of government' said the manifesto, 'must be to spur industry forward and not to choke it with red tape'. But it did not work out that way. The red tape remained and was especially abundant and harmful for the publicly owned industries. The Treasury kept tight control over their finances, hence of their policies, from the beginning and this limited their autonomy.</p> <p>If Labour had won the 1950 election with a convincing majority it might have gradually freed itself from the straitjacket of the old public corporation and favoured a variety of different kinds of common and co-operative ownership like enterprises owned by their employees (like the John Lewis Partnership or like mutual building societies owned by their members and mutual insurers owned by their policy holders, all subject to market forces but without throwing away the whole notion of an alternative to ordinary private enterprise.</p> <p>The mutuals remaining up to now - in insurance and building societies - would probably have been saved from recent carpetbaggers and the ever-present temptations of greed. The Halifax, the Woolwich and Abbey National would not have turned their back on their Victorian origins and become commercial banks. As it is, by a strange turnaround the Nationwide amongst building societies and Standard Life amongst life insurers are, with some others, fighting for the cause of common ownership which Labour once espoused; as it has worked out, they have not had any noticeable backing in their fight from the government.</p> <p><b>The elevation of profit-seeking</b></p> <p>Public enterprise being beyond the pale, private enterprise has become the icon. The premium it places on competition, on profit-motivated judgements, and on acquisitiveness, has been given a seal of approval. Private enterprise is regarded as all-round superior to public services with their own more altruistic ethic. It follows that privatisation has to be pursued for all the world as if there has been no change of government. In a way it now requires more determination even than Mrs. Thatcher had to cut back the public services further because so much was taken away from them previously and it is not obvious who the next victims should be out of what little is left.</p> <p>It is strange to see such enthusiasm for the privatisation of Air Traffic Control and the partial privatisation of London Underground when it has become rather generally admitted that the same Department made such a botched job of rail privatisation. The public services have been regarded as having a special advantage when safety has to be a first priority; it is difficult to be so sure about safety when profit is also paramount. Then, according to present practice, so much call has to be made on private finance for the building of hospitals, the take-over of quarters for servicemen and offices for government departments. The taxpayer has anyway to bear the cost of such developments in the longer term. Why is it better to incur long-term obligations of that sort than for the public body itself to raise the money?</p> <p>The superiority of private enterprise is now dinned into the public service by the practice of calling upon it to save the day when the public authorities are said to have 'failed'. It can happen when individual schools have failed or a whole local education authority, as Leeds lost control of its school services after an OFSTED inspection report which the Chief Inspector said was serious and shocking. The government has recommended intervention in 15 local education authorities which have been inspected. Privatisation can happen when a prison is in trouble even if the private company has no experience in running prisons or no experience in the transport of prisoners to and from the courts. The private company, being private, is (they imply) bound to be better at providing a public service. I am sorry for Herbert Morrison in his grave, and only hope he is communicating with his grandson.</p> <p>I suppose it is in keeping with its predilection for private enterprise when the government turns on its own people - the people it employs in the public service - and attacks them. Against teachers the denigration has been part of a long-lasting campaign, and a bitter one. The Conservatives started it. It is not just the public remarks. The two-pronged attack has been built into the institution of schools (a) through the ubiquitous system, devised in detail by the central government and its attendant quangos, for testing children on their attainments at frequent intervals during their school days as well as (b) by the inspections by OFSTED, behind them looming the figure of Chris Woodhead, HM Chief Inspector of Schools, the hammer of the teachers. It matters so much because many schools, particularly in inner cities, have become the reinforcers of inequality. In the name of equality of opportunity they have consigned all those who cannot take advantage of the opportunity, and as it has turned out this is mostly boys and those who come from troubled family backgrounds, to a position of early inferiority which tends to perpetuate itself throughout life. The brand of inferiority can be burnt into children even at nursery school if they do not do as well as some other children and the teachers or the situation make this clear then.</p> <p>The regular testing of children is at the same time the regular testing of their teachers, and one that marks the teachers too if the results are poor and their school stands out for its lowly position in the published league tables. Where that happens an OFSTED inspection becomes more than ever dreaded. Bad marks again and in extreme cases a school can be closed down or a company or other new team brought in to make an attempt to put things right.</p> <p>If teachers are frightened and their reputation undermined, the quality of their teaching is bound to suffer. The work of teachers is extremely demanding when so many of their pupils are disturbed by the stresses in their own families and when even those who are not disturbed have become less biddable. Teachers need to be valued. To perform they need to feel good; and many of them feel far from that. One result of the official criticism of teachers is that more and more parents who can afford it take their children off to private schools, and more and more teachers are considering turning against the Party which has turned against them by making them into separators on a grand scale of the sheep from the goats.</p> <p><b>Local government</b></p> <p>But perhaps nothing is more extraordinary in this saga of a government turning on its own than its part in destroying local government. The government professes to believe in devolution and it has taken its own protestations seriously and bravely in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But why not for Geordies or Scousers, Glaswegians, Brummies, or the Cornish, or the people of Durham or Sheffield or the South Hams? They are gradually being disenfranchised. Councillors, amongst them many who are the backbone of Labour in their localities, have been pushed aside, and their staff scorned - though between them they are the agents of government for the performance of hundreds of duties and the spokesmen to central government about the peculiarities and the needs of their local electorate. We hear no more of subsidiarity - the happy doctrine that the work of government should be done at the most local level possible unless there is good reason to the contrary.</p> <p>The undermining of local government has certainly not been in the interests of the poor, except where, as sometimes happens, they have been involved in the local implementation and there actually has been decent local planning. Mobilise local people, including the poor, and give them their head, and something really valuable might come of it. Poorer people have a special interest, if only they can make it effective. For :<br> 'Poorer people almost always experience worse environments than richer ones. Air pollution and traffic congestion are worse in inner city areas than leafy suburbs; there's less green space and more litter. Rich people can buy sufficient energy to give their cars air conditioning; poor people cannot afford to heat their homes properly. As the Government's Acheson report into inequalities in health showed, not only are respiratory diseases more prevalent among people in low-income groups, but so are traffic accidents. Friends of the Earth recently showed that the most polluting factories in Britain were all located close to low income residential areas.' (D McLaren et al, Pollution Injustice, Friends of the Earth, 1999. Quoted in an excellent Fabian pamphlet - M. Jacobs, Environmental Modernisation - the new Labour agenda, Fabian Society, October, 1999).</p> <p>The point, about health is particularly telling. The link between ill-health and poverty (and also with lack of control over work and working conditions) has been amply demonstrated. (R.G. Wilkinson, Unhealthy Societies - The Afflictions of Inequality, Routledge, 1996. M.G. Marmot et al, 'Changing Social Class Distribution of Heart Disease', British Medical Journal, II:1209-12, 1978).</p> <p>Public services matter most to the poorer because they are dependent on the public services to get their essential needs satisfied; they have nowhere else to go. If poorer people are dissatisfied with the school their children attend, or will have to attend in the future, they have not the money to buy a place in a private school. If they are dissatisfied with the medical care they receive they cannot go private, to a private doctor. Without money you either get from the state school or the GP and the National Health Service what you need, or you get nothing. The public services - beyond the two big ones, of education and health - include dozens of others, housing, social services, refuse disposal, sometimes buses, libraries, roads, pavements, traffic management, sporting facilities, parks, leisure and recreation, which come from local government. They provide the essentials of life to everyone but especially to poorer people who cannot afford to pay for them.</p> <p>The budget of mid-2000 came at a crucial time. More was to be spent on education and health. It will take years for the increased expenditure to work its way through to individual schools and hospitals. Public spending, especially on massively complex services, cannot be turned on like a tap. But it was a sign, and indeed a very welcome one. At least there is a show of egalitarian sentiment. The public service element in the standard of living of the poor should, in due course, rise.</p> <p>The spending will not bear fruit in full measure unless other complementary steps are taken. The attacks on teachers need to stop. They need to be valued and allowed to do their job of teaching without being harried, and without their children also being harried by tests and inspections. The only way in which best value can be obtained from each pound spent is through respecting and, indeed, honouring the people in the front line who are actually going to provide the service, face to face, hand to hand, to the children in the schools and the patients, the actual men, women and children attending the surgeries. The hoped-for improved standards of delivery will not feed through to the public if at the same time the infrastucture is being overhauled root and branch by the abolition or weakening of local education authorities or handing over the building of more and more hospitals to private companies who may be able to secure the funding if government underwrites it all but who know little or nothing in fine detail about the needs that hospitals have to satisfy. The best advice to Whitehall is to trust the people who know about the localities in which regeneration is being attempted to get on with it. (The value put on public services is one of the many virtues of a new textbook on economics - H. Stretton, Economics - New Introduction, Pluto Press, 1999). </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,367280,00.html\">Part three: Middle England again</a></p>",
  "The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, yesterday accused William Hague of legitimising racism and failing to stand up to extremism in his own party. <p>Insisting Britain must accept and embrace the multicultural society it has become, Mr Cook accused the Tory leader of exploiting fear. </p> <p>He also challenged Mr Hague over his refusal to close down an extremist publication in his party and his decision to promote so many colleagues with questionable records on race. </p> <p>Speaking to his Livingston constituency party, Mr Cook said: \"When William Hague talks of Britain being threatened by a flood of asylum seekers, he is exploiting fear. </p> <p>\"When Liam Fox claims that foreign doctors are threatening the lives of British patients, he is guilty of encouraging prejudice. </p> <p>\"If we are to build Britain as a stable and successful multicultural society, politicians need to mind their language.

And No.</p> <p> <strong>BCOS6</strong><br> I love your M-less books, however I have not gone down the SF road yet. Why do you seperate the two genres with your two names? It's almost as if you don't want people to accidently buy the wrong one... </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Correct! Also my family gave me some grief for leaving the M out of the mainstream ones...</p> <p> <strong>Maynard78</strong><br> Do you think imagination is a gift or can it be taught and nurtured? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> I strongly suspect it's a gift, and if it can be taught or nurtured it's only for a fairly brief period in childhood. But, hey; I'm no expert.</p> <p> <strong>tanyaj</strong><br> How does one write a novel? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> To the best of one's abilities.</p> <p> <strong>Domo2000</strong><br> With a bit of luck our material abundance will let us live something like the Culture, one day. But after all the material and political crap is sorted out, the only remaining Utopian bit left to consider is love, sex and relationships. At first, your Culture writings on this solely portrayed rampant promiscuity. I don't have your books to hand, but the self-imposed exile of the pregnant lady (Excession) who'd been cheated on, after firm commitments of love and faithfulness, is obviously different. So too with the star of The Business, infatuated with a man despite (or because) of his total commitment to his wife. (Sorry, I'm no good with names). <br> Would you agree that there's a balance between the pre-60's miserable marriage lock-in on the one hand, and shallow bed hopping on the other? Not that sexual pleasure cannot be enjoyed without marriage. Nor that anyone should ever be constrained from ending an unhappy relationship by society. But, that experimentation should not eclipse the fact that committed love is usually/often the ideal state for human happiness? <br> PS Any tips for not getting shafted by publishers when trying to get a book published? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Tricky; I always have the get-out that the Culture isn't us; not exactly the same species at all, and therefore their nature isn't ours (and has anyway been heavily interfered with through genetic manipulation). But generally I'd agree with the sort of balanced approach you're talking about. <br> Publishers: get a good agent.</p> <p> <strong>rossmi2</strong><br> Are you planning a sequel to Use of Weapons? At the end of the book, there was what appeared to be the opening chapter of a sequel. Also, have you been approached or have plans to turn any culture books into films, and if so, which one would you prefer was filmed. </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> No; I don't tend to do sequels. The last bit of UoW is there to imply that another story, similar to Zakalwe's (even down to Sma's involvement and some history to do with a [wheel] chair) is about to begin, and has been at least partially instigated by Z's own actions. And of course Z is back to his old tricks too, because both the prologue and the epilogue take place after the main action of the book. So it all continues... <br> Yup; Pathe have optioned Player of Games, though the one I'd really like to see is Phlebas...</p> <p> <strong>Keith68</strong><br> Thanks for all the words you've written. <br> Is the separation of your writings, using a middle initial for your science fiction works, a method to combat schizophrenia? Perhaps that is too strong a word (I apologise), but there seems to be an amount of writing without constraint, or flexing of imagination in your science fiction. Do both styles go hand in hand or is there an amount of cause and effect. That is, is the SF a result of frustration at the constraints of realism in your novels set in the present day? <br> PS Do you enjoy SF films, and which ones in particular? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Not schizophrenia. There is more unconstrained fun to be had writing the SF, but it's not any sort of therapy. <br> Yes. Dark Star is still probably my fave.</p> <p> <strong>wheeler66</strong><br> Does political passion drive your desire to write, or is it merely a theme you enjoy? <br> Who intends to retire first: Iain Banks or Iain M. Banks? Or will they both live forever? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> No. Wish it did. <br> Neither would give the other satisfaction, though both are taking a year off from the start of September.</p> <p> <strong>jcmullen99</strong><br> Thanks again for Look to Windward! <br> If rumours of your taking a year or so 'out' from writing are to be believed, can we look forward to your arrival on the virtual scene soon? <br> A IB/IMB website would be very popular! Or would that cut across what you are doing? Or is that rumour just a rumour?! </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Yes. My Install CD from madasafish is lying at home even as I write to you from here, the throbbing heart of the Guardian/Observer empire (at 15.43 on 23.8.00 according to my watch). <br> Website designing might be a laugh. I'll see how easy it is...</p> <p> <strong>leperman</strong><br> I have read and tremendously enjoyed all your work, both the sci-fi and contemporary novels. But one thing has been bothering me for years - what was the very end of 'Use of Weapons' all about? I read and re-read it several times, but am still at a loss. Please help a confused soul. </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> I refer my honourable friend to the answer given above (to rossmi2). The clue that the prologue/epilogue bits both happen not long after the main story is Zakalwe pushing his hand through long hair that isn't there any more (after he cuts it all off just before the enemy storm the citadel once the dirty deal has been done on... umm... I've forgotten the name of the planet). Make sense?</p> <p><strong>craigmcgill1</strong><br> Two words: Greenock Morton. What can you say to that? </p> <p> <strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> You mean The Mighty 'Ton? I'd say, \"Will you please stop calling them Mortonnill?\" to my wife. She seems to think it's funny...</p> <p><strong>davegolder</strong><br> What is it with The Wasteland?</p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> It's just a jolly fine poem, is all. I don't know; it's always seemed to resonate with me, despite the fact I disagree with almost everything TSE stood for.</p> <p><strong> aclandi </strong><br> Thanks for the books. I'm interested to know about the significance of T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\" part IV as title references for the first and latest Culture novels. Is the drowned Phoenician symbolic of the hubris of first the Idirans and then the Culture itself? More worryingly, does this indicate a full circle and that there will be no more Culture novels? Or are you just a fan of Eliot? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Fan of Eliot. As for the Culture, like I said earlier - if I can borrow one of Arnie's lines - I'll be back (well, probably). The drowned mariner seemed like a good image to evoke for what is arguably just a tale of a shipwrecked sailor who falls in with a gang of pirates and goes in search of buried treasure on an enchanted isle guarded by a sleeping dragon... Plus there is a sea-change, right on the surface of the sea, when Horza Changes to resemble Kraiklyn...</p> <p><strong>JakeHulme</strong><br> I'm a big fan of both your mainstream and SF books - I don't see a conflict between the two. However, do you have any intentions towards, or thoughts on, a novel that bridges the gap between the two? I ask because I feel that Consider Phlebas (along with Neuromancer) rejuvenated SF literature just when it needed it, but the two have very different themes - Phlebas (and a lot of your other SF books) have been of the 'space opera' style, whereas Gibson is more near-future. Recent writers (I'm thinking of Jeff Noon and Michael Marshall Smith in particular) seem to have followed Gibson's path, but with elements of the fantastical that echo yours. It seems to me that there could be a place where your mainstream and SF themes intersect. </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Hmm... doubt it. In a sense this conjunction has already occured (twice, arguably). It's there in The State of the Art, and - so people keep telling me - in The Business, which some people have seen as the possible starting point for something like the Culture on Earth (I'm more sceptical). Still, I know what you mean, but... probably not.</p> <p><strong>adaldan</strong><br> Mmhh. You see, I have been arguing about the death penalty with a lot of people lately, mainly from the USA. And I have always thought that the claim that the Culture was really a thinly-disguised USA was risible... but now you go and have a Culture entity acting on revenge and retaliation, even resorting to torture. Means to an end, eh? Not a Culture agent like Zakalwe, but a Culture entity... and not in self-defence either. This margin is too small to say exhaustively why, but it troubled me. It echoed some of the arguments of the pro-death people. I'd hate to think that you didn't share my opinions! ;-) <br> But LTW is such a gentle, almost tender book. Did I miss something? Perhaps I have idealised the Culture too much, much more than you yourself did? <br> Or perhaps you owe us another book about this. :-)</p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> I am absolutely against the death penalty. I think if Scotland brought it back and England didn't, I'd go and live... well, in Berwick probably... <br> Also, the Culture doesn't just not have a death penalty, it doesn't even have an imprisoning penalty. <br> All I can say is that at this sort of level - the realpolitik level of attempting to prevent the sort of attack that might kill billions of civilians - even the Culture throws away its usual moral rule-book. This is what SC is for, in a sense. That doesn't make such actions right, just less wrong, and arguably less wrong that not acting at all or, as I said earlier, acting in too predictably. <br> Besides; I've always said the Culture is as close as something remotely like us could ever get to a genuine Utopian state; I never said it was perfect</p> <p><strong>craigmcgill1</strong><br> You once mentioned a possibility of a sequel to Wasp Factory - I take it that's a dead duck now? Would you do it for a daft amount of money or would you always knock it back if you didn't think there was a top tale in it? <br> Also, who's on your reading list these days? Do you like stuff by folk like Chris Brookmyre? </p> <p> <strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Not much deader than it ever was. I'd do it if I thought of a total cracker of an idea that would carry the book beyond the initial idea (though I think this is unlikely to happen). I don't think I would if it was just for money. But then ask me when/if I'm poor and maybe I'd change my mind.</p> <p> <strong>lovefunk</strong><br> You write such rich books which get to the crux of human imagination and experience. I've always wanted to be a writer, but work for an internet start-up company instead. This choice of a career has taught me a lot about myself. Generally, the industry's culture gives you alot of reward for your toils, and if you are unlucky or not cut out for the job, a lot of cable to hang yourself with. <br> Anyway, my question to you is about your career and the sort of person you are. Please could you tell me what writing has made you into in your eyes? What have you learnt about yourself as you have gone along the way? This is a bit personal, but I do see my own strengths and weaknesses quite clearly. I can hold a convincing argument, and am genuinely interested in everyone I meet, and every experience I have. On the down side, there is something that I am fighting to keep alive in me as I get older (a grand 27 has been clocked so far), and more in touch with my innards. A real battle that creates energy and fear. If I don't fight, I believe that old age will be hard and full of bitterness and regrets. <br> In sum, the question was, what has writing made you into? And, what have you learnt about yourself as you have gone along the way? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> I have to say I don't know. It's made me a writer, I guess, but then that seems a trivial answer. The problem is that I've wanted to be a writer since I was in primary school, and I've either been trying hard to make it happen - or actually been a writer - ever since. There's not much of a base-line to compare my current self too, in other words. Difficult to perform a control experiment on that one... Sorry.</p> <p> <strong>zackhunter</strong><br> Are you au fait with the fictions of J G Ballard, and if so, has his writing had any influence on your own? And what did you think - again, if you've read it - of Michel Faber's Under The Skin? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Yes, and I'm a fan. I think Ballard is beyond influence, if you know what I mean; his style is so intrinsically his I find it hard to imagine anyone aping it without making themselves look just plain silly. <br> Haven't read Under The Skin. </p> <p> <strong>janetrs</strong><br> I have enjoyed the TV and radio adaptations of your other novels -anything else in the pipeline? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Film options of Espedair Street, The Bridge and The Player of Games. Wasp Factory still in litigation. In all cases, don't hold your breath.</p> <p> <strong>MACGreen</strong><br> Have you ever considered writing for videogames? <br> Can we expect to see an Iain M Banks Space Opera for PlayStation 2 anytime soon? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Briefly. But I am not a team player, so it won't happen. So, not by my hand.</p> <p> <strong> Domo2000</strong><br> Is there a chance that you'll feature more on the sublimed entities, from the Culture Mythos? Or do you think it's best to maintain the mystery of something that is altogether beyond our comprehension? Haven't read Windward yet though, only saw it for the first time yesterday. </p> <p><strong> IainMBanks</strong><br> Doubtful. Maintain the mystery, and don't try to think unthinkabilities...</p> <p> <strong>woody01</strong><br> Thank you for all those great books, I especially enjoyed The Bridge, Walking on Glass, State of the Art, Feersum Endjinn and Inversions. <br> Are your novels influenced by paintings and music ? I'm thinking of the reference to Magritte's paintings in Walking on Glass, and of a composer as the main character in your new Look to Windward. <br> And another question: What do you think of the Episode 1 of Star Wars and the Star Wars prequels in general? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Not consciously, as a rule (though the first bit of the first chapter of Look To Windward was inspired by a painting hanging in a hotel in Oxford - snowy barges on a canal... it was the Old Parsonage hotel, I think. Anyway). I suspect there was some sort of general feel in old Stones and Led Zep songs that affected me in some hazy way, a long, long time ago, but I wouldn't like to try and be more specific. <br> I'm a bit of sucker for the first three Star Wars films. Episode One looked stunning, but the plot was lame.</p> <p><strong>BillyBollocks</strong><br> What age did you start writing? Was it a precocious talent or did it require some dedication? <br> One more: any particular incidents along the way that inspired you to continue trying to be a writer? </p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> I tried writing my first novel when I was fourteen (thought I had, too, till I did a word-count) and wrote something resembling one when I was sixteen (the snappily titled The Hungarian Lift-Jet). <br> It was precocious something, that's for sure, and it needed a lot of dedication. Luckily I dedicate fast, as it were. <br> Not really, though the long-term encouragement of friends helped.</p> <p><strong>MattB242</strong><br> Somebody once told me that the ships 'Very Little Gravitas Indeed' and 'Zero Gravitas' were a response to a scathing review. Is this true? </p> <p> <strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Yes. But it was a scathing review of Culture ship-naming policy delivered by another Involved civilisation. They suggested that such enormously powerful and intellectually refined entities ought to have names with a little more gravitas, to reflect their near-god-like status; the immediate and sustained reaction of one of the Culture's ship manufacturies was to name all its subsequent vessels things like: Stood Far Back When The Gravitas Was Handed Out; Gravitas, What Gravitas?; Gravitas... Gravitas... No, Don't Help Me, I'll Get It In A Moment; Gravitas Free Zone; Low Gravitas Warning Signal, etc etc (including the Zen-like Absolutely No You-No-What). I am so sad I have a separate list of the Gravitas ships at home. It currently runs to about 20, I think.</p> <p> <strong>Strid</strong><br> A couple of questions that have already been raised in one form or other, but who would you say are your favourite writers and what sort of music do you like ? You always make reference to a lot of contemporary music in your non-SF books and I wondered what sort of things you listened to? </p> <p> <strong> IainMBanks</strong><br> I also have a list of favourite authors. The SF one starts with the name Aldiss and ends with Zelazny and there are a lot in between, let me tell you. Maybe soon I'll have my own website, and I'll post the list to that. <br> Oh, most of the stuff that's mentioned in the books, and certainly Family, Led Zep, The Pogues, The Pixies, Nusrat... actually that's another long, long list. Best recent single for me was Aisha by Death In Vegas. On the other hand, Look To Windward was written mostly to Glenn Gould playing Bach, with a bit of Radio One thrown in.</p> <p><strong>SpenceDavies</strong><br> Re: your non sci-fi stuff. Do you set out to write a 'page-turner' or a work of literature? Do you feel stylistically constrained in any way? Do you think your readership, in general, also enjoy Pynchon, or whatever?</p> <p><strong>IainMBanks</strong><br> Both, if possible. No constraints apart from logic. It's plausible that some readers might treat me as a Pynchon-lite (but then, who is not, in comparison). </p> <p> Well, I must be going now (16.45); sorry I couldn't answer all the questions. Some other time, I hope. </p> <p> Thanks for all your interest. Pip pip!</p>",

  "<p>No one is more delighted than Dave Podmore that the cynics and knockers and so-called humorists have at last been put in their places. English cricket can now get out of bed in the morning and look itself in the bathroom mirror after 30-whatever years of hurt. </p> <p>But there is a danger that in this obsessive lust for Test-match victories we will lose sight of why we all got into cricket in the first place. Namely job security, a nice house (and car obviously), a Somerfield's chargecard for the fiancee, plus a couple of benefits and a Sky Sports blazer afterwards. </p> <p>Take it from me as an Englishman, if you neglect the game at county level it will soon wither at the top. This was roughly what I said to Darren Gough the other day when I dropped him a line questioning his decision not to play in Yorkshire's final games. Unfortunately it got misunderstood; a passing remark about him being a cocky little toe-rag who didn't deserve to live and ought to pay back every penny of his wages was mistaken for hate mail, when all I was doing was airing a concern shared by many long-standing county members. </p> <p>So let Nasser Hussain and his golden boys enjoy their success while it lasts. Pod yields to no one in his desire to see them succeed this coming winter, but having said that it will be very interesting indeed to see how Master Michael Vaughan copes against a Pakistani spinner on a roaring bunsen with a radio-controlled ball in his hand and a home umpire stood behind him. </p> <p>What you need in that situation is not Test-match flipping temperament but a touch of Delhi belly to take you out of the equation for a week - wait for them to fly in Mark Ramprakash then feet up by the pool. That's cool-headed professionalism, never mind prancing about the Oval squirting champagne. </p> <p>Pod has more or less given up hope of getting the sub-continental nod, even though I've kept myself in fairly good nick this season. And what's more I haven't needed a central contract (the cricket equivalent of one of Thora Hird's stair-lifts). What some of those knockers and humorists interpreted as laziness on my part, reluctance to field etc, was in fact a highly developed use of cruise control, whereby you don't do anything that might endanger life and limb unnecessarily. Like diving or bending down to stop a ball that's as good as over the boundary rope already. </p> <p>This is a technique I've developed after close study of some of the Windies lads, and the 10,000-odd Test wickets Curtly and Courtney have got between them speaks for itself. </p> <p>I can't say too much about this right now but Dave Podmore will in fact be central to the forthcoming series in an undercover capacity. You may have heard about the initiative taken by General Zia in appointing a secret agent to spy on any of the Pakistan lads who might be taking bungs and back-handers. Well it wasn't long before the ECB cottoned on to the idea, especially in view of the almost supernatural improvement shown by England this season - you can't tell me it's entirely kosher. And who better to undertake this espionage mission than someone whose career batting average is not unadjacent to .007? </p> <p> I shall be working incognito in a variety of guises which for obvious reasons must remain just that. If you're a touring international cricketer you tend to spend a fair bit of time off the park dressing as a woman. I've adopted identities as diverse as Diana Ross and Bet Lynch so I'm highly qualified for the job as well as being aware that it's not without its risks - Javed Miandad swears blind it wasn't him who put chilli powder in my blusher on the '87 tour but why was he there with his camcorder if not? </p> <p>The merest hint of a conversation with a bookmaker will be instantly picked up by specially adapted tins of corned beef and winter vegetable soup with sausage. These recording devices are the brainchild of the ECB gizmo czar, who's also come up with a cyanide samosa and an exploding CD of The Hottest Themes from TV Commercials - Ever (Vol 3). </p> <p>I can't pretend my months underground aren't going to be hard on Jacqui. When she asked what hotel I'd be staying in I could only say, \"If I told you, love, I'd have to kill you.\" But she'll be more than busy running my fan club, coming up with a new name for starters - \"The Pod-O-Philes\" is asking to have your front door kicked in.</p>",
  "<p>Hernando de Soto has pulled off a remarkable feat. You may not have heard of him, but governments around the world are apparently queuing up to hear what the Peruvian thinker has to say. Egypt, Romania, Haiti and Mexico, as well as his home country, are seeking and implementing his advice in a bid to transform their economies. Geoff Mulgan, head of the Number 10 policy unit, had him in to Downing Street. The World Bank is pouring huge sums into his projects. The Economist ranks his Lima-based institute as the second most important thinktank in the world. De Soto is pitching himself as a third way guru and it's working. With the launch of his new book, he's flavour of the month. </p> <p>The third way needs him. The weakest assertion at the heart of the bundle of ideas lumped together by a loose alliance of Tony Blair, Bill Clinton, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and other left-of-centre leaders such as the Brazilian Fernando Cardoso, is that capitalism can distribute wealth widely. The evidence is to the contrary; recent history seems to be proving the Marxist claim that, inevitably, a capitalist system concentrates wealth in fewer hands, thus sowing the seeds for its collapse. </p> <p>Walk on de Soto. His appeal lies in large part because he doesn't challenge the status quo; he accepts capitalism is the only economic system on offer. What he focuses on is the huge black economy that operates outside the legal system in all countries, particularly in the developing world and former Soviet bloc. In the extralegal economy, the poor accumulate huge assets in their shanty homes and small businesses, but because they have no legal protections, they cannot access credit nor can they safely invest. Their assets are thus \"dead capital\" as opposed to \"live capital\" in the west. The big idea can basically be summed up as: \"It's property law, stupid.\" </p> <p>De Soto has made a useful point. The underground market in Russia and Ukraine accounts for 50% of GDP and 62% in Georgia. According to his institute's inventory, as much as 90% of Cairo's economy is extralegal. In his emphasis on the enormous entrepreneurial energies of the poor, and that they know better than any policymaker how to improve their lot, de Soto should be shifting the minds of politicians and donor governments in the right direction. Perhaps he can help uncouple the ideas of poverty and laziness that still lurk behind some compassion fatigue towards developing countries. After all, in many countries it is the entrepreneurial resourcefulness of some of the most marginalised - women traders in west Africa for example - who ensure that millions of people are fed and clothed. </p> <p> But what this most certainly does not amount to is a big idea to solve global poverty. Gathering around de Soto is a semi-hysterical spinning that ludicrously compares him to Adam Smith and Karl Marx. His book, The Mystery of Capital, is breathless, grandiose, and claims to have fathomed \"secrets\" and \"mysteries\". But if that's what it takes to get a book that baldly states that globalisation is not working for five-sixths of the world's population on to the US bestseller charts, then more power to his elbow. </p> <p>Governments do need to devise ways to hook the extralegal economy into the formal economy. Opt into the system and you get access to credit to invest in your home and business, and you don't have to pay bribes to the mafia. De Soto claims his theory is backed up by what happened in the fast-track scheme he designed for small business under President Fujimori's government in Peru, when 276,000 businesses voluntarily opted for legalisation. </p> <p>But what de Soto doesn't acknowledge is that the balance of benefit between staying out of the system and opting in can be delicate or even tipped firmly against. Perhaps for shanty dwellers in Brazil or market stall holders in Kiev, the local mafia has far more clout than any government. To them, legalisation only doubles their burden, adding taxes to the bribes they will have to carry on paying. </p> <p>The laws a country makes and how they are enforced reflect the disposition of political power - and that is determined by who has economic power. De Soto's work is an elaborate smokescreen to hide the uglier truth. The power, political and economic, lies with the globalised elite in developing countries who are often employed or bullied by western multinationals, and who run those countries for the maximum extractive benefit of the west. We import their raw commodities at rock bottom prices, and export back to them manufactured goods; we restrict their manufactured exports and we charge high levels of interest on their debts. None of that, of course, gets a hearing in de Soto's work, which is no doubt partly because his CV includes a stint as an economist for Gatt (the precursor of the WTO) and as the chief executive officer of \"one of Europe's largest engineering firms\". This is touchy, feely capitalism with a heart. Handle it with care. </p> <p> The Mystery of Capital by Hernando de Soto is published by Bantam Press. <br><a href=\"mailto:madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com\">madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Health</strong><br>Under article 2 of the European convention on human rights, the right to life, not only must the state refrain from taking life, but it has a positive obligation to safeguard life. <strong> Postcode rationing</strong> for lifesaving drugs on the NHS, allowing patients in Oxford to have a drug but not in Newcastle upon Tyne, could be challenged under the right to life. Courts will probably still be reluctant to encroach too far on decisions by NHS trusts about allocation of resources, but will have to approach cases differently, giving more weight to the rights of the individual. Trusts will find it difficult to deny a dying person a life saving drug purely on the basis of resources. The convention (article 14) bans discrimination in relation to all the protected rights, such as life, so restricting kidney dialysis to patients of a certain age could come under challenge. </p> <p>Challenges to the <strong> refusal of medical treatment </strong> could also be brought under article 3, the right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. When the Home Office proposed to deport a convicted drug smuggler with terminal Aids to his own country where no treatment was available, the European court of human rights held this to be a breach of article 3. </p> <p>Withholding of <strong> palliative treatment</strong> could also be challenged. In a judicial review against a London NHS trust which was settled out of court, article 3 was invoked to challenge a refusal to give pain relief to a woman with a severe mental handicap. </p> <p>Lawyers representing claimants suing over road, work or medical <strong> accidents</strong> are expected to use article 8, the right to privacy, to challenge defendants' rights to see all the claimants' medical records, however irrelevant to the claim. </p> <p>The right to infertility treatment is covered by article 12, the right to found a family, but states have a broad discretion as to the rules under which they make it available. If the convention had been incorporated earlier it might have helped Diane Blood, who travelled to Belgium to be impregnated with the sperm of her dead husband. British law prevented her from doing this in the UK because her husband had not given his consent. </p> <p>The <strong> closure of long stay hospitals </strong> and care homes is being challenged as a breach of article 8, the right to respect for family life, home and correspondence. Lawyers argue that closure denies residents respect for their home, an argument which has found favour with English judges. </p> <p>The <strong> mental health</strong> field is expected to be a fruitful one. Government plans to allow people with serious personality disorders to be detained if considered dangerous, even though they have not committed a criminal offence, are likely to be challenged, an appeal court judge predicted last week. Many doctors believe these disorders cannot be treated and the convention probably allows detention only for treatment. </p> <p><strong> Law and order</strong><br> </p> <p>The state has to protect the right to life where it reasonably can. In carrying out their duties to prevent and suppress <strong> crimes of violence </strong> , the police must do \"all that could be reasonably expected of them to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which they have or ought to have knowledge,\" the Strasbourg court said in the case of Osman v UK. This opened the way for human rights claims where police fail to respond to threats and death or serious injury results. Victim support groups argue that in extreme cases of domestic violence there is a right to life issue and police have a duty to investigate. </p> <p>The <strong> criminal justice system</strong> - from police investigation through prosecution, trial, appeal and prison - is expected to give rise to the most cases. Most will involve article 6, the right to a fair trial. </p> <p>One of the main areas of challenge is expected to be what material the prosecution must disclose to the defence to guarantee a fair trial. When taking decisions on bail, judges must give more weight to the presumption of innocence. Procedures for withholding material from the defence on the grounds of public interest immunity, particularly allowing prosecutors to go before a judge without telling the defence, will need extra safeguards. </p> <p> <strong> Marchers and demonstrators</strong> charged with public order offences are likely to argue that a conviction would breach their right to freedom of expression (article 10) and freedom of assembly (article 11). </p> <p>Police forces which use <strong> stop and search</strong> powers that discriminate against ethnic minorities could be challenged under article 14 (the anti-discrimination article) coupled with article 10 or article 11 (freedom of assembly). The convention does not ban discrimination generally but only discrimination in relation to a right guaranteed by the convention. </p> <p>Article 8, the right to family life, could be invoked if the local authority fails to seek a remedy, such as an anti-social behaviour order, where neighbours create a serious nuisance. Prisons and police may have to tighten up their procedures for preventing cell suicides. The system for dealing with <strong> deaths in custody</strong> and the inquest system in general is likely to come under scrutiny to decide whether it provides a thorough enough investigation to safeguard the right to life. A Strasbourg ruling in a recent French case has established that when an individual is taken into police custody in good health but is injured it is incumbent on the state to give a \"plausible explanation\" of how those injuries occurred. </p> <p>The home secretary has lost his right to decide how long <strong> prisoners serving life</strong> for offences other than murder - discretionary lifers - and juveniles serving life should serve. The Strasbourg court has left him the right to decide on mandatory lifers - those, like Myra Hindley or Rosemary West, serving life for murder. But this could come under challenge again in the English courts. </p> <p><strong> Prisoners</strong> are expected to bring claims on a number of fronts, as they have done in Strasbourg. Different age limits for girl and boy offenders who can be sent to secure training units could be challenged. </p> <p>Laws on drink<strong> drivers</strong> and speed cameras are said by some to be in complete chaos following cases in Birmingham and Scotland where courts held it was a breach of article 6 for suspects to be required to incriminate themselves by admitting they were at the wheel of the car. But the cases could be overturned on appeal. If not, a small amendment to the law could ensure that motoring prosecutions comply with the convention. </p> <p><strong> At work</strong><br> </p> <p> For the first time, there will be a <strong> right of privacy</strong> in English law. </p> <p>Employers snooping on their staff will be prime targets for early test cases. The TUC is highlighting <strong> employer surveillance</strong> as a priority area for cases under the act. Practices likely to come under scrutiny are routine monitoring of staff telephone calls and emails, and CCTV monitoring. Companies and organisations that routinely record calls, such as insurance companies and banks, must ensure that staff are able to make personal calls that are not recorded. </p> <p><strong> Dress codes</strong> may come under fire for breaching freedom of expression, particularly where they discriminate between the sexes. Cases in which employers were held to be justified in imposing a ban on long hair for male but not female staff, and a requirement for female but not male nurses to wear a cap, would probably be decided differently in future. The TUC also hopes to back unions challenging <strong> discrimination against gay and lesbian employees </strong> , which is not currently unlawful. </p> <p>The law on <strong> picketing </strong> , limiting the number of pickets to six at or near the workplace, could be challenged as a breach of freedom of assembly. </p> <p><strong> Family life</strong><br> </p> <p> Fathers frustrated in their attempts to see their children by obstructive former partners are expected to invoke the right to respect for family life. A European court ruling that \"the mutual enjoyment by parent and child of each other's company constitutes a fundamental element of family life\" will help fathers. </p> <p>Greater rights for married than <strong> unmarried fathers</strong> could be considered discriminatory. The Strasbourg court has said that the distinctions are justified but Strasbourg rulings are not precedents like the judgments of UK higher courts, and challenges are possible. </p> <p>The implications of the act for local authorities are far reaching. There will be much more scope to challenge the decisions of social services departments in <strong> childcare</strong> cases. At present if courts think a care plan is unsatisfactory their only choice is to accept it or refuse to make a care order. Under the act they will be able to examine the merits of a social service decision. </p> <p>If local authorities fail to intervene despite clear evidence of serious abuse the court could force it to intervene to spare the child further inhuman and degrading treatment. A case pending in Strasbourg is likely to endorse this. </p> <p>Under English law, the <strong> welfare of the child</strong> is paramount. The convention requires all the parties' rights to be respected and is likely to be invoked in care proceedings and adoption cases to make sure the rights of the natural parents to respect for their family life are adequately considered. The convention will guarantee<strong> parents' rights</strong> to see papers and records when decisions are to be taken on their child's future. </p> <p>People in <strong> same sex relationships </strong> are likely to seek the same rights as heterosexual couples including the right to marry, the tax benefits that go with it, and the right to claim financial support when the relationship breaks down. Same sex couples in Canada have won the same rights as husbands and wives to claim support payments and a share of assets when they split up. </p> <p><strong> Education</strong><br> </p> <p> The right to education is not in the original European convention on human rights, but in article 2 of protocol 1, which was added later. No one can be denied education, but cases at Strasbourg have established that there is no right to a particular type of education, such as education in a single sex or selective school. <strong> Universities </strong> are allowed to restrict entrance to those who can derive benefit from them. </p> <p>Cases have established that the state may take needs and resources into account, and the UK has made a reservation to the right in the protocol. This states that the UK accepts article 2 of the first protocol \"only so far as it is compatible with the provision of efficient instruction and training and the avoidance of unnecessary public expenditure\". So parents wanting provision for their child which involves extra spending by the LEA will find little help. </p> <p>Article 2 says that the state must respect parents' right to ensure teaching \"in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions\". But the state is not required to subsidise a particular form of <strong> religious education </strong> , as long as it allows parents to educate their children at home and allows private schools to be established. </p> <p>The right to respect for their convictions does not allow parents to challenge the curriculum. Danish parents who challenged compulsory sex education for children from nine to 11 failed in Strasbourg. </p> <p><strong> School exclusions</strong> are likely to be a fruitful area for challenge. Heads will not be prevented from excluding children but there must be a full and transparent process. Government plans to give a bigger say to heads are certain to be challenged if they go ahead. Under article 14 on non-discrimination, if a disproportionate number of black children are excluded from a single school they may have an argument. </p> <p>A recent House of Lords ruling, following the principles in the Osman decision on police negligence in Strasbourg, allows LEAs to be sued for negligence if they fail to provide effective education for dyslexic children and others with <strong> special needs.</strong> </p> <p><strong> Environment</strong><br> </p> <p> Environmental rights were not on the agenda when the European convention was drafted in the aftermath of the second world war. But cases brought to Strasbourg in the past five years show that environmental concerns are becoming a fertile source of human rights litigation. </p> <p>Incorporation of the convention is expected to lead to claims that public bodies have breached their rights to a safe and clean environment, either directly or by failing to enforce laws against private polluters. Articles 2, 8 and 1 to the first protocol (peaceful enjoyment of possessions) are expected to be cited. <strong> Planning procedures </strong> may also be attacked as breaching article 6, the right to a fair hearing, as has happened in Scotland. </p> <p>However, lawyers predict that many challenges may fail because cases can be brought only by someone who is a \"victim\" of the breach and in other cases public authorities might be able to show that interference with article 8 was justified in terms of the greater good. </p> <p>Article 2 could cover cases where local authorities or other enforcement bodies find evidence of a serious hazard but fail to take effective action or to alert those at risk. The threat of such cases might force authorities to produce more informative environmental data. </p> <p>Claims against public authorities for failing to intervene in <strong> environmental pollution</strong> and nuisance cases might now succeed where they would have failed under English common law because of the difficulty of proving the public authority owed the individual a duty of care. There is no need to prove this under the convention, simply that the right was breached. </p> <p>The Strasbourg court found there was a breach of article 8 and awarded damages against Spain where the authorities failed to tackle the environmental damage caused by a waste treatment plant for tanneries built near the applicant's home. </p> <p><strong> Privacy and free speech</strong><br> </p> <p> Some lawyers predict that this is the area where incorporation of the convention will have its biggest impact. Lord Bingham, now the senior law lord, has argued that the courts could and should develop a right to privacy, now absent from English law, based on the convention. The convention provides for two clashing and competing rights, the right to freedom of expression and the right to respect for private and family life. Strasbourg case law makes it clear that, while privacy is important, freedom of expression is essential to democracy. A safeguard has been written into the Human Rights Act designed to make it harder to obtain <strong> gagging orders</strong> prior to publication. </p> <p>The courts could carve out a right to privacy while protecting the <strong> public's right to know </strong> and the media's right to report on matters of genuine public interest. In future, for example, the courts would protect anyone in the position of Gorden Kaye, the star of 'Allo 'Allo, who was interviewed and photographed by the Sunday Sport in his hospital bed when he was still heavily medicated after an operation. </p> <p>Elements in <strong> libel law </strong> are likely to come under attack, including the onus on defendants in libel actions to \"justify\" factual statements to prove them true. </p> <p>Nigel Wylde, a former Defence Ministry computer consultant, whose trial for breaches of the Official Secrets Act over a book, The Irish War, by Tony Geraghty, starts on November 20, will cite article 10, freedom of expression in his defence. </p> <p>So will the former MI5 agent David Shayler, also facing prosecution for breaches of the Official Secrets Act. </p> <p><strong> Immigration and asylum</strong><br> </p> <p>The convention is likely to be widely invoked by those with <strong> British-born children</strong> facing deportation, who will argue that returning them to their home countries will breach their right to family life. Cherie Booth QC has begin a high court case on behalf of a Ghanaian national convicted of smuggling cocaine who faces deportation, although he has lived in Britain for many years and has a British wife and children. </p> <p>The Strasbourg court has held, however, that immigration procedures do not violate the right to family life if the family can establish itself elsewhere or if claimants have brought it on themselves by flouting immigration controls. Ministers have said they will pay travel costs to ensure family unity outside Britain and will allow families to stay only on compassionate grounds. </p> <p><strong> Main articles incorporated into UK law by the act</strong> </p> <p><strong>Article 2</strong> Right to life </p> <p><strong> Article 3</strong> Prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment </p> <p><strong> Article 4</strong> Prohibition of slavery and enforced labour </p> <p><strong> Article 5</strong> Right to liberty and security </p> <p><strong> Article 6</strong> Right to a fair trial </p> <p><strong> Article 7</strong> No punishment without law </p> <p><strong> Article 8</strong> Right to respect for private and family life </p> <p><strong> Article 9</strong> Freedom of thought, conscience and religion </p> <p><strong> Article 10</strong> Freedom of expression </p> <p><strong> Article 11</strong> Freedom of assembly and association </p> <p><strong> Article 12</strong> Right to marry and found a family </p> <p><strong> Article 14</strong> Prohibition of discrimination (in access to the other rights) </p> <p><strong> Protocol 1, article 1</strong> Right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions </p> <p><strong> Protocol 1, article 2</strong> Right to education </p> <p><strong> Popular misconceptions about the convention</strong> </p> <p><strong> Myth </strong> It is a fevered byproduct of Brussels lawmakers. </p> <p><strong> Fact </strong> The European convention on human rights is a British export, drafted by Home Office civil servants after the second world war for the Council of Europe, which covers 41 member states. Its headquarters are in Strasbourg. </p> <p><strong> Myth </strong> Laws governing virtually every area of British life will be turned on their head because ministers have signed the human rights convention. </p> <p><strong> Fact </strong> The change is that Britons no longer have to go to Strasbourg to get cases under the convention decided. </p> <p><strong> Myth </strong> Myra Hindley and Rosemary West will see their sentences slashed. </p> <p><strong> Fact </strong> Strasbourg has declared that murder is so serious that early release is a privilege not a right. The House of Lords said life can lawfully mean life for Myra Hindley as long as her case is kept under review. </p> <p><strong> Myth </strong> Britain's motoring laws will be thrown into chaos. </p> <p><strong> Fact </strong> Minor amendments to the law establishing whether the owner was driving at the time of an offence is expected simply to bring Britain into line with the rest of Europe. </p> <p><strong> Myth </strong> Fagging, cold showers and early cross country runs will be banned in public schools. Gay sex will be legalised among schoolboys and school uniforms will be outlawed as infringing freedom of expression. </p> <p><strong> Fact </strong> Headteachers will remain in loco parentis and school rules will still apply. Gay sex among under-16s remains illegal. </p> <p><strong> Myth </strong> Wives, husbands and children of asylum seekers will be allowed into Britain under the right to family life. </p> <p><strong> Fact </strong> No. Ministers have already said they will pay travel costs if a family faces being split by deportation, and will allow failed asylum seekers to remain only on compassionate grounds. </p> <p><strong> Myth </strong> It is a licence to sue. There will be legal chaos. </p> <p><strong> Fact </strong> Out of 600 human rights challenges in the trail blazing Scottish courts, fewer than 20 have been successful. </p> <p>Useful links<br><a href=\"http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/5e.htm\">European convention on human rights</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.open.gov.uk/lcd/humanrights/parlfr.htm\">Details of the passage of the act through parliament</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Brotherly love</strong> </p> <p>As crack squads on the Sun and the Mirror prepare for the climax of Big Brother on Friday and Heat magazine plans an eight-page supplement on the occasion, there is one newspaper which could, if it wanted, outdo them all in the race for the best insider's insiders guide. Step forward The Telegraph. Kevin Myers, respected columnist at The Irish Times and the Telegraph, is used to writing about affairs of the nation. But reluctantly he has also found a very special link to Channel 4's cult TV show. Anna, little butter-wouldn't-melt-in-your-mouth Anna, is his sister in law. And by all accounts, Mr Myers is none too happy to talk about it. Shame. </p> <p><strong>What a relief</strong><br> Media Monkey feels duty-bound to report the latest unsavoury incident involving Sun TV reporter Emily Smith, despite concern that it may be accused of developing a Dominic Mohanesque obsession. Earlier this week Wee Smithy apparently ordered a cab from home to the press launch for Channel 5's fab new voyeur TV-fest, Jailbreak. After the cab showed up outside her abode, Smith gathered her things and headed out the door, only to be met by the sight of the cabbie - a woman - squatting to relieve herself in the front garden. The poor lass had obviously got all over-excited at the prospect of meeting the woman involved in THAT passionate public embrace with \"Nasty\" Nick Bateman.</p> <p><strong>Up front</strong><br>Prog rock band Marillion have taken a leaf out of Steven King's book and raised money via the internet to fund its next album. Why the band couldn't find a record label to provide the required funding is something of a mystery, but, undeterred by this apparent lack of faith, Marillion decided to email its 30,000 fan base asking for money with the threat that if it didn't get the money it wouldn't reward its steadfast fans with more fine melodies. How much did they raise? Get this - a whopping \u00a350,000. Of course the fans haven't just given the band the money, they've effectively bought the CD in advance. Clearly they were so blinded by Marillion's music that they've entrusted the band not to produce a pile of shite. Could Marillion have hit onto something? Perhaps if other bands followed Marillion's lead we could see the return of such fine acts as America teen sensation Tiffany.</p> <p><strong>Second Tuesday</strong><br>There's nothing like being an out-and-out copycat is there? You may recall the reason why First Tuesday is so called is because it holds events on the First Tuesday of every month. It's called stating the obvious because it's true, us internet types aren't that bright. Other networking groups have been a little more inventive - The Chemistry, The Ecademy and The Glasshouse for example - but none have been quite so bold as to pinch First Tuesday's inspirational idea, as First Monday, one of those it does-exactly-what-it-says-on-the-tin type of events - and absolutely nothing to do with First Tuesday. And it doesn't look like stopping there - a quick skinny though Net Names and it turns out that all variations of First and a day of the week have already been registered. Prepare to be inundated. </p> <p> <strong>Top banana</strong><br>A free banana to the correspondent from Wardour Street who's come up with the first response to Media Monkey's call for Big Brother tie-in ideas. Big Brother-branded prozac \"for when you know they're watching you\" we like; but the suggestion involving nipple cams is just not appropriate for a family-oriented diary column.</p> <p><strong>Bunch of Arse</strong><br>Always up for a good old crusade against hypocrisy, Media Monkey is indebted to the TV type who pointed out some shocking inconsistencies in Granada Media's net-busting deal to buy a piece of the famous Arse. After all, is this not the same Granada Media that was just recently arguing for the Carlton/United merger to be red-carded because it would cause a deplorable widening of the north-south media divide? Surely, following this logic, if Charlie Allen's Weatherfield Rovers mob are so committed to the north, they should be putting their wonga into say, Accrington Stanley, or Bradford Park Avenue? </p> <p><strong>What an offer, Hezza</strong><br> Michael Heseltine's generous offer to sell his book to staff at the knock-down price of \u00a310 has apparently met with a terrific response. So much so that Hezza has promised to sign every one personally. \"His generosity exceeds our wildest expectations,\" said a Haymarket source. </p> <p><strong>Jungle fever?</strong> <br> A memo went round Haymarket Publishing's offices today with the following unmissable offer for all Michael Heseltine's minions: \"Haymarket has a quantity of Michael Heseltine's book, \"Life in the Jungle\", published today, at the special price of \u00a310.\" The lines to Hezza's office must be jammed. <br></p> <p><strong>Wise words</strong> <br> Andrew Neil, speaking at the recent People and Profits in the New Economy conference: \"If you have trouble with recruitment and retention, then your company sucks.\" Could that be the same Andrew Neil who has recently had quite a lot of trouble with staff retention at the Scotsman? Your words, Andrew, not ours. <br></p> <p><strong>Mo better box</strong> <br> Word that retiring Labour MP St Mo of Mowlam is considering a TV career has got Media Monkey flicking through its contacts book in search of old broadcasting muckers who may be able to help out. The first call will undoubtedly be to the ITV Network Centre, where they are still a chief executive short of a full ITV Council. St Mo would be the ideal candidate - after all, she has plenty of experience of a job where people are always knifing you in the back. But Media Monkey would welcome other suggestions...</p> <p><strong>\"Nasty\" Nick snapped</strong> <br> Media Monkey is certain the Sun, as the official Big Brother newspaper, will be gagging to get its hands on some photos reportedly doing the rounds, which show \"Nasty\" Nick Bateman in his first public clinch with a member of the opposite sex since being evicted from the house of two-way mirrors. The offending snaps, taken outside the Met Bar after the TV Quick awards on Tuesday night (September 4), are said to feature Nick in a warm embrace with, er... go-getting Sun TV reporter Emily Smith. All in the line of duty, no doubt.</p> <p><strong>Sky's the limit</strong> <br> Does the low cunning of the BSkyB marketing department know no bounds? Imagine little Johnnie and Jemima's delight when, after a spot of bulletin reading courtesy of Sky News during their visit to the Millennium Dome, they are given a videotape of the performance to take home and treasure. Imagine their disappointment when, on getting home and watching the video, they have to sit through several minutes of trailers for Sky TV services before glimpsing their brief moment of fame. Fiendishly clever. </p> <p><strong>A few Choice words</strong> <br> The dirtiest catfight in telly, Terry Wogan v Stuart Murphy, splutters on in the letters column of BBC in-house organ Ariel. You may recall that in a letter to Ariel last week, BBC Choice head honcho Murphy launched a stout defence of the BBC following La Wogan's recent attack on the corporation, telling him he was \"living in a bizarre fantasy world of an Auntie's Bloomers script\". This week in Ariel, BBC broadcasting and presentation staffers Mark Thomas and Christina Dunley leapt to Wogan's defence, accusing Murphy of \"wanting us to work for a Stalinist BBC where employees dare not utter any criticism of their masters\". The pair conclude: \"Let's face it Stuart, Choice has never delivered on the promise of its name... the sooner BBC3 rises from its ashes the better.\" Miaow!</p> <p><strong>Don't talk at Talk</strong><br> The queen of New York publishing, Tina Brown, is giving Brits abroad a bad name. Staff members at Talk magazine have been told not to approach Ms Brown directly with ideas or questions, as their input is \"driving her crazy\". New York magazine reports gleefully that the new rule is that editorial director [Bob Wallace] or his direct underling [Perry van der Meer] must filter Tina's traffic. Wallace disputes the account, saying that while Van der Meer -- who worked under Brown at The New Yorker -- was brought in recently to streamline the editorial process, \"anyone can still come to Tina and me or e-mail us at any time about any issue. And believe me, they do.\" The New York Times' source notes sorrowfully: \"No one wants to hear that they're driving their boss crazy.\" Ms Brown is in England on holiday.</p> <p><strong>Croaky name?</strong><br> It's official: advertising agency names are getting sillier. First there was Mother - the trendy, Clerkenwell-based agency that looks after Harvey Nichols and Hoegaarden Beer. Then the disgraced political lobbyist Derek Draper launched an ad agency and mysteriously decided to call it Farm. Now Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse - a company that's surely old enough to know better - has appointed an agency called Strawberry Frog to handle its ads. It makes you long for the good old days, when adland was full of egotists who called their agencies after themselves, and had done with it.</p> <p><strong>A little unfortunate</strong><br> Marks &amp; Spencer has been trying to do its bit for normal women by using unusually curvaceous models (to put it politely) in its new ad campaign. So it was unfortunate that only the day before the distinctly uncurvy Tara Palmer-Tomkinson appeared on the front page of the Daily Mail as the new face of Splendour.com - a lingerie-selling website in which M&amp;S has a stake. A small case of double standards, perhaps?</p> <p><strong>No small beer</strong><br> Far be it from us to suggest that anyone in advertising takes the whole business of making ads too seriously. But the reaction of Heineken international marketing manager Frazer Thompson to the French ban on alcohol ads may have been a little extreme. \"In France the world has gone dark,\" said a grief-stricken Thompson. </p> <p><strong>Toilet watch</strong><br> News that Channel 4 is planning to bring out a Big Brother jigsaw in time for Christmas has inspired Media Monkey to ponder what other sensational TV tie-ins broadcasters may have up their sleeves. We'll start the ball rolling with the mouth-watering prospect of Channel 4 linking up with Armitage Shanks and Triton to bring out Big Brother-branded toilets and showers with built-in CCTV cameras. Other suggestions welcome.</p> <p> Email the Media Monkey at <a href=\"mailto:monkey@mediatheguardian.com\">Monkey@mediatheguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>With the nation fixated on television's parody of George Orwell's dystopic vision of the future, most of us have failed to notice the real Big Brother sneaking through the floorboards into the back of our screens. On July 28, while many of us were settling down with a bag of crisps to see whether Nasty Nick had been rumbled, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act was passed.</p> <p>In response to growing hysteria about \"cybercrime\" such as child pornography on the net and hacking, it gives the government, police, security services and lesser public authorities such as your local council, benefits office, even the Eggs Inspectorate, the power to intercept anyone's emails and demand decryption keys or passwords. </p> <p>There was an outcry at the time: internet thinktank FIPR, the Foundation for Information Policy Research, has declared the bill \"a grevious affront on our civil liberties\", while Liberty, the human rights group called it \"repugnant\" and the Conservatives snapped up the opportunity to wheel out the \"Blair's demon eyes watching you\" campaign again. </p> <p>A couple of the broadsheets - and Roy Greenslade in Media Guardian - nobly attempted to explain the implications for people who didn't understand the significance of the clauses in part III pertaining to cryptography, which mean that if you forget your pin number for your cashpoint card or mobile and are therefore unable to hand over the key to the authorities who have issued a warrant, you could be banged up for up to two years. </p> <p>The main complaint, according to the FIPR, is that it is \"a superbly effective machine for keeping tabs on law abiding citizens [such as journalists, who, for example, might find it very difficult to investigate a public authority and protect their sources] and of no use against criminals who can easily circumvent the proceedures.\" </p> <p>But anti-RIP feeling is just one aspect of the growing international protest against the infringement of data protection and escalating surveillance. In July it emerged that the FBI had been using Carnivore, a black box internet wire-tapping machine, for almost a year; in New Zealand it's the fight against the Echelon surveillance system; in Holland it's against the OCI (operational crypto interception) project. </p> <p>But even without the spectre of the \"technologies of political control\", we are entering an era of hyper-connectivity and data surveillance which would be beyond even Orwell's wildest imaginings. In terms of sheer penetration of \"smart screens\", reality has far outstripped fiction. Most households in Britain by 2004 will have at least two internet-enabled devices - most likely digital TV with broadband internet conection, home computer or mobile, while some of us will have gone the whole hog, with wired cars and kitchen appliances all \"talking\" to each other using Blue Tooth technology and co-ordinating our schedule for the day. </p> <p>Already people talk about how impossible it is to switch off. With ADSL \"always on\" phonelines, there is no escaping the network - unless you unplug every night. Connection speeds will be 20 times faster but that means the computer will be 20 times more susceptible to hacking and data leaks. Barclays bank had a bit of a shock in July when customer data had escaped onto the website. But corporates have the resources to counter these security risks and ultimately it is the average PC owner who should worrying. </p> <p>\"It is almost impossible for the man in the street to be sure that their computer is safe from a break in,\" says Caspar Bowden, spokesperson for FIPR. \"If there is data that you care about, just don't keep it on the machine\". People with broadband connections, he predicts, will feel obliged to fit personal firewalls to stop the threat of unsolicited visits and hacking and there will be a massive boost in sales of piracy tools designed to run rings around the RIP Act. </p> <p>With RIP, we can only trust that the authorities won't abuse their position, but can we trust the advertisers to do the same? The practice of web-tracking is already common amongst some new media agencies. Through a simple combination of cookies which attach themselves to the user when they visit a site, they can already, without their consent, build up profiles of users and follow them several other sites afterwards. Meanwhile, with third generation mobile phones that can pinpoint the user's location to a matter of metres, the central computer can doctor advertising promotions accordingly and in seconds. </p> <p>When consumers sign an online consent form to give up personal details and address information in exchange for offers and promotions - be it an ice lolly or a ticket to Steps - they are giving away precious data which could end up in the hands of third party advertisers or agencies who will pay handsomely for the information. \"It's a trade off - you buy privacy with hard cash. Something could cost you \u00a320 less if you agree to pass on your data,\" says Bowden. </p> <p>Privacy is becoming a privilege we have to pay for. In America, backlash is already happening. The White Dot anti-TV campaign has just launched a controversial book, Spy TV, which exposes the methods by which digital interactive television will observe viewers and build up geographic, demographic and psychographic profiles of individuals which can then be used to \"modify their behaviour\". </p> <p>Motorola Broadband, ACTV and OpenTV have all invested in a company called digital ADCO which is designed to profile over 7m viewers without their knowledge. ACTV promises to deliver commercials based on \"the specific profile of an individual household which is generated by ACTV's software within the digital set-top in the home.\" Every time we change channels, select a certain programme, browse or buy through an interactive site, every click can be tracked. In other words, our TV sets will know us better than we know ourselves. </p> <p>\"People should express concerns about privacy to the data protection commission\", says Bowden, as a last recommendation to any paranoid consumers out there, \"and beware of phrases like 'personalisation' and 'tailor-made'\". </p> <p>New applications and technologies are sold to time-strapped and increasingly technophilic citizens, as a means to introduce more control and convenience into our lives; but ultimately, who is control of our personal details? Answer: the advertisers, marketeers, public authorities, data analysts and even that producer sitting behind the screen in the Big Brother interview room handing out tasks to the guinea pigs and offering kind words of advice.</p>",
  "A brother and sister conceived through donor sperm insemination are to bring a test case under the Human Rights Act when it comes into force in three weeks' time demanding the right to know details of their father. <p>Adam and Jo Rose and several other adults are being backed by Liberty, the civil rights organisation, which will argue that the law banning disclosure of information about sperm donors is a breach of article 8, the right to respect for private and family life. </p> <p>Lawyers for the Rose siblings will argue that non-identifying information, such as the donor's blood group and medical history, should be provided automatically, and that children conceived by donor insemination should be treated the same as adopted children. Identifying information should be available to the children if the donor agrees, they will argue. </p> <p>The challenge is one of a barrage of cases expected to hit the courts following the biggest law change for 300 years. From October 2, for the first time, Britain will have an over-arching set of principles to which all existing laws will be subject. </p> <p>The act will incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law, sparing citizens the long trudge to the European court in Strasbourg. Other cases lining up include: </p> <p>\u0095 Ron Strank and Roger Fisher, retired nurses and a couple for 40 years, hoping to win the same rights as married partners to an NHS spouse's pension for the survivor when the first one dies; </p> <p>\u0095 The former MI5 agent David Shayler and the ex-MoD com puter consultant Nigel Wylde, both defending Official Secrets Act charges under article 10 of the convention, freedom of expression; </p> <p>\u0095 A challenge to the disproportionate use of stop and search powers against young black men, and an attempt to curb the illegal holding of DNA samples by police; </p> <p>\u0095 A challenge by the charity Tax Aid against discriminatory tax laws which give a bereavement tax allowance to widows but not to widowers; </p> <p>\u0095 Cases over the closure of long-stay hospitals and care homes, the university visitor system of resolving disputes, and a London borough's procedure for granting bar licences; </p> <p>\u0095 Moves by unions over the surveillance of employees at work and discrimination against gay employees.</p>",
  "It has always been at the heart of the English libertarian tradition that citizens can do whatever they like unless it is specifically banned by parliament. <p>When the Human Rights Act comes into force next month this will not change for the individual citizen, but for the first time government ministers and public bodies will find themselves having to operate within a set of agreed minimum standards which can be enforced by British judges. The courts will have much more power than before to hold the government and public bodies to account. </p> <p>But how enthusiastically will the judges stride out into the new human rights landscape? Will they flex their muscles at the expense of parliament, the people's elected representatives? </p> <p>From October 2, the act will incorporate the European convention on human rights into UK law, making rights enforceable in the UK courts which could be invoked previously only by a long, hard slog to Strasbourg. The task will be a wholly new one for judges used to poring over and interpreting the strict wording of statutes. They will now be asked to give effect to a broad brush bill of rights. In many cases, precedents of the UK courts, so carefully followed in the past, will become irrelevant. </p> <p>Critics of the Human Rights Act complain that this new power for the British courts to interpret the European human rights convention to protect individuals against abuses of power by elected politicians or public officials involves a significant erosion of the power of parliament. The former Tory home secretary, Michael Howard, argued that balancing individual rights against the exercise of power on behalf of the community at large often involved difficult judgments better made by politicians accountable to the voters than by unelected judges who cannot be dismissed. </p> <p>But the record of parliament, not to mention home secretaries, is not so exemplary when it comes to safeguarding the rights of less popular minorities, such as prisoners, asylum seekers, travellers and gays. Much of the impetus behind the convention was to ensure that minority rights would not be trampled on by the majority. </p> <p>Some leading Tory figures such as Lord Hailsham and Lord Brittan strongly supported the convention's incorporation over the years. But William Hague's party has already begun to attack the change, claiming it will shift legislative power from parliament to the judges and that their more controversial judgments will lack the support of the public. They argue that incorporation will \"weaken our accountable democratic traditions\". </p> <p>One major factor in Labour's conversion to the act was the \"elective dictatorship\" under Margaret Thatcher during which key senior Labour figures overcame the party's traditional hostility to \"Tory judges\" and came to believe that the courts could provide an essential check against an overweening executive. </p> <p>That check contained in the minimum standards set out in the human rights convention will apply not only to the government but to all bodies discharging a public function. It means that private prison companies will have to operate to a minimum set of standards. The courts are also considered a public body, so the convention could be breached if, for instance, an individual had no redress for invasion of privacy by a newspaper. </p> <p>There will be cases in which the judges will have to tread a fine line between the interests of the community, as defined by parliament, and those of the individual who might be bringing the human rights challenge. The question then is who takes precedence - parliament or the judges? </p> <p>The government has drafted the Human Rights Act to ensure that the courts cannot strike down acts of parliament agreed by elected MPs. What the judges will be able to do is to issue a declaration that a statute is incompatible with the European convention. </p> <p>Lord Lester QC, one of the key architects of the Human Rights Act, says that this will leave it to the government and parliament to decide whether to amend the offending legislation or to defend the case before the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. The aggrieved citizen will still have the option of taking the case to Strasbourg if no action is taken to change the law. \"It will be for government and parliament to decide whether to accept the judicial verdict,\" says Lord Lester. </p> <p>The legal principle that parliament still rules was set out this year in the Kebilene case in which Lord Steyn, a law lord, said in a House of Lords judgment: \"It is crystal clear that the carefully and subtly drafted Human Rights Act 1998 preserves the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. In a case of incompatibility of interpretation under section 3(1), the courts may not disapply the legislation.\" </p> <p>Those who advocate incorporation argue that this gets around the problem of giving more power to unelected judges. Because MPs will have the last say and citizens can lobby their MPs, they can do something about it if they take exception to a judge's decision. However, some argue that it will put the government under overwhelming political pressure if a judge issues a declaration that a particular act of parliament is not compatible with human rights. </p> <p>That power, together with the power to strike down secondary legislation such as rules and regulations drawn up by ministers under acts of parliament, will tilt the present balance of power in the judges' favour. </p> <p>In addition, the judges will be drawn into making \"much more obviously political decisions\" in judicial review cases challenging the decisions of ministers and public bodies, the appeal court judge, Sir Henry Brooke, acknowledged last week. He told a conference of the Howard League for Penal Reform that judges would pay appropriate deference to ministers. But he pointed out that for the first time judges would have to decide whether government interference with a human right was \"necessary in a democratic society\" - a clearly political value judgment. </p> <p>How active will the English judges be in applying the convention? In Canada, which adopted a similar charter of rights in 1982 - producing, one senator predicted at the time, in words later adopted by the Scottish judge, Lord McCluskey, \"a field day for crackpots, a pain in the neck for judges and legislators and a goldmine for lawyers\" - the supreme court has struck down a number of statutes. Its rulings have been described by some critics as \"a criminal's charter\". </p> <p>In Scotland, the human rights convention has been partly in force for more than a year as a result of devolution. Members of the executive, including the lord advocate, responsible for prosecutions, are subject to it, but other public bodies will not be covered until next month. Scottish judges have not let many challenges through - only 17 of 587 have succeeded - but although they have used the new powers sparingly they have readily embraced human rights principles. </p> <p>One decision, relying largely on Canadian supreme court case law, has put motoring prosecutions relying on admissions by suspects that they were behind the wheel into limbo, at least until the result of an appeal. Another, that part-time sheriffs were not independent enough of the executive to guarantee a fair trial, threw the court system into disarray. A third, which had little publicity south of the border, has put question marks over the fairness of the Scottish planning system. </p> <p>Ishbel Smith, of the Edinburgh law firm McGrigor Donald, said: \"The decisions show that Scottish judges are not just aware of the convention rights but are prepared to apply them to their full potential, no matter what the consequences.\" Early indications from the cases which have been brought in the run-up to October 2 are that English judges are taking a fairly conservative line, at least in criminal cases. </p> <p>As the judges are drawn further into political controversy the demand for reforms in the way they are appointed is bound to increase. At the same time pressure is likely to grow to establish a human rights commission for England and Wales - similar to the equal opportunities commission and the commission for racial equality - to help individuals bring cases under the new act and to help spread a human rights culture. Northern Ireland already has a human rights commission. </p> <p>The government has not ruled out setting up such a commission but ministers say they are yet to be convinced it is needed. The arrival of incorporation next month is likely to hasten its creation. </p> <p><b>Strasbourg cases that changed UK law</b></p> <p>Ten significant rulings from Strasbourg: </p> <p> 1. Prisoners won the right to consult a lawyer, write to an MP or a newspaper, and to sue the Home Office without having to have permission of the home secretary. 1975. </p> <p> 2. Certain interrogation techniques used at the RUC Castlereagh detention centre in Northern Ireland were banned after Dublin brought a case alleging torture and ill treatment. 1977. </p> <p> 3. Birching outlawed in the Isle of Man. 1978. </p> <p> 4. Sunday Times thalidomide ruling lifted a high court gag on publishing damning reports on the effects of a drug on unborn children and led to reform of contempt of court law. 1979. </p> <p> 5. Law changed to make it easier to opt out of joining a trade union. 1981. </p> <p> 6. Corporal punishment in schools was ruled not to be degrading but there had been a failure to respect the philosophical convictions of the mothers of two Scottish boys who were opposed to such beatings and brought the case. 1982. Caning in all state schools was banned in 1986 as a result. </p> <p> 7. Stricter controls on telephone tapping were introduced after a police operation that used unauthorised taps against an antiques dealer, James Malone. 1984. </p> <p> 8. It was ruled that the British government had violated freedom of expression by banning the Guardian, Observer and Sunday Times from publishing extracts from Peter Wright's book Spycatcher. The press played \"the vital role of public watchdog\". 1991. </p> <p> 9. Government lifted the ban on gays and lesbians serving in the armed forces after it was ruled to be illegal under the right to privacy and to family life. 1999. </p> <p>10. Bulger case ruling. Children charged with murder or manslaughter will never again face the full ceremony and publicity of an adult jury trial after the court ruled that Jon Venables and Robert Thompson had not received a fair trial because as juveniles they could not have understood the proceedings, and it was wrong for the home secretary to decide their final sentence. 1999.</p>",
  "<p>The Jerusalem Post, one of the world's most famous newspapers, has been put up for sale for at least $80m (\u00a356m) by Conrad Black's Hollinger International, the owner of the Daily Telegraph. </p> <p>Investment bank Morgan Stanley's New York office is conducting an auction of the title which has a loyal following among Jewish communities worldwide. More than three-quarters of the hits on the Jerusalem Post's popular jpost.com website come from the United States. </p> <p>The auction comes a month after Mr Black sold the bulk of his Canadian newspapers and magazines to CanWest Global Communications, Canada's third largest television network, for \u00a31.6bn. </p> <p>Mr Black has owned the Jerusalem Post since 1990, during which time he has shifted its political allegiance from the left to the right of Israeli politics. It has also developed links with The Wall Street Journal and successfully embraced the internet. </p> <p>Jpost.com has become one of the most visited newspaper websites and is a potentially lucrative source of e-commerce and advertising revenues. </p> <p>Several bidders are thought to have held talks with Morgan Stanley including Michael Sinclair, publisher of the London Jewish News, though it is thought his offer of about $20m was turned down. Mr Black is believed to be prepared to hold on to the title until the right offer emerges. </p> <p>The Post's readership, made up of immigrants from English-speaking countries and an older generation of Israelis of Central European extraction who never entirely mastered Hebrew, remains static and is believed to stand at under 30,000. Since 1998, the Post has been challenged by the liberal Ha'aretz newspaper which launched an eight-page English language edition as an insert in the International Herald Tribune. </p> <p>Many of the Post's readers drifted to Ha'aretz though the paper has solid support from orthodox English-speaking immigrants who support its rightwing policies. </p> <p>Mr Black first bought into the Telegraph Group in 1985 when he took a 15% stake and the group under Lord Hartwell was struggling. Within six months he had control of the newspapers. Four years later they were making a profit. </p> <p>Last year the Hollinger group had revenues of $2.1bn (\u00a31.3bn) and had an operating profit of just under $213m. </p> <p><strong>Parsimonious publisher turned deaf ear to breaking news</strong></p> <p>The defining moment of the Hollinger era of ownership of the Jerusalem Post arrived with the outbreak of the Gulf war in 1991, writes Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem.</p> <p>The news that American missiles had landed on Iraq broke at 2am local time but the publisher refused to pay the printers overtime so the Post was the sole Israeli paper not to cover the attack on the night. </p> <p>Such cost-cutting zeal, and a marked shift to the right, have eroded the reputation of the Post since Conrad Black acquired it in 1989. Within months, the takeover prompted the walkout of 29 of the Post's most seasoned journalists in a protest against editorial interference. </p> <p>Many saw the walkout as the beginning of the end for the Post. Founded in 1932, the paper over the decades had managed to transcend its status as a small town newspaper by virture of its location in a country that is a news treadmill. It earned an international reputation for thoroughness and reliability, and for tolerating a wide range of opinion. </p> <p>That changed when Hollinger came into the picture. The intifada, the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories that erupted in 1987, sharpened focus on the management's move of the paper to the right of Israeli politics. Since the election last year of a more liberal prime minister, Ehud Barak, the Post has shifted back towards the centre, in response to the changing realities in Israel. </p> <p>However, the Post relies heavily on foreign news agencies reporting Israeli politics and diplomacy, running the material unattributed under the bylines of its poorly paid and largely young staff.</p>",

  "<p>Tony Blair today launched a \u00a31bn drive to get all government services online by 2005. </p> <p>The prime minister also said that \u00a315m would be allocated to help businesses benefit from the internet and announced the first raft of 600 online centres to give hi-tech access to poorer communities. </p> <p>Mr Blair, speaking in Loughborough, Leicestershire, said that the UK Online initiatives were designed to get business, people and government hooked up to the internet. \"My argument is simple. There is no new economy. There is one economy, all of it being transformed by information technology. </p> <p>\"What is happening is no dot.com fad that will come and go - it is a profound economic revolution. Business and government must now be in a constant process of adapting to change. </p> <p>\"The key to success is knowledge - and the key to government is investment in education and skills.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair also disclosed details of the first annual report produced by the government's \"e-envoy\", Alex Allan. </p> <p>The prime minister said Britain now had the best off-peak rates for connection to the internet in the world. He said the UK peak access prices had fallen by 30% to 40% since last year and he expected the country to go \"shooting up the league table\". </p> <p>Mr Blair said that 90% of workers were now employed in businesses connected to the internet and that a third of the UK population was now online, with the country boasting Europe's largest e-commerce market with \u00a32bn spending last year. </p> <p>He said a new campaign would be launched to make Britain the best place in the world for e-commerce, with universal access to the internet and all government services on the net. </p> <p>Mr Blair added: \"I am determined that by 2005 at the latest all government services will be online, so we are today announcing that our recent spending review earmarked \u00a31bn for investment in electronic service delivery over the next three years.\" </p> <p>He said that from next year unemployed people would be able to search job vacancies from home or in a Job Centre kiosk, place job adverts online or register for VAT online. </p> <p>\"The whole shape of our economy will be changed by this new technology - that's why UK Online is so vital.

  "It's hard to believe, but the global oil corporations that are making money hand over fist at the moment actually dislike sky-high crude prices. <p>Shell recently announced sheepishly that it had made \u00a326m a day over the first six months of the year, but then called on OPEC to increase production to bring down the price of crude.</p> <p>Why? Because what they really want is highish crude prices: ones that are sustainable in the long term and which do not trigger a backlash from politicians worried about inflation or global recession and consumers fed up with paying a fortune to fill up their cars</p> <p>When oil prices are very high, oil groups fear exactly what has happened over the past week: oil depots around the country being brought to a standstill by angry hauliers.</p> <p>The truckers are blaming government for levying too much tax but the oil companies inevitably get some of the flak for alleged profiteering too and have their operations disrupted.</p> <p>Sir John Browne, chief executive of BP, recently unveiled a 200% increase in first-half profits, but went on to express his sympathy for the \"Dump the Pump\" campaign by motorists arguing that government should reduce its tax take.</p> <p>Nevertheless, oil companies are also fearful that politicians could levy windfall taxes on them or just tighten the fiscal regime covering the development of oil fields in the North Sea.</p> <p>In fact, the margins for oil companies on the forecourt are slim due to the intense competition from supermarkets that partly use petrol as a loss leader.</p> <p>Shell recently shutdown 120 service stations in Britain on the grounds that they do not make enough money, which might seem odd given it made overall group profits of nearly \u00a34.5bn in the half year.</p> <p>But major UK-based oil corporations like Shell and BP - two of the world's big three - make their money on the \"upstream\" side, bringing the black stuff out of the ground and selling it on to their own or others' refineries for processing into petrol for cars, aviation fuel or whatever.</p> <p>The oil companies themselves have little control over the price of oil.

  "Road hauliers and farmers yesterday lifted the last of their blockades from outside France's oil refineries and fuel depots, ending a week-long protest that had brought large parts of the country to a standstill. <p>But while French fuel tankers, exempted from a customary weekend ban, raced to resupply the 85% of France's petrol stations that had run dry, German truckers were moving to fill the breach, threatening nationwide motorway and road blockades yesterday after Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's coalition rejected calls for the abolition of its controversial ecological fuel tax. </p> <p>Bernward Franzky, director of the road hauliers association in Lower Saxony, warned: \"Whole autobahns risk being brought to a standstill. The situation is getting out of control.\" </p> <p>Germany's lorry drivers began disrupting traffic at the weekend. </p> <p>On Saturday 120 lorries sealed off the north German town of Hildesheim for several hours. </p> <p>On Friday 40 truck drivers drove into the town of Uelzen in the same region and blocked off the centre during a visit by German transport minister Reinhard Klimmt. </p> <p>Even in France where the dispute was winding down, oil companies warned it would be several days before the situation returned to normal. </p> <p>The French interior ministry said the final seven blockades, manned by militant farmers and road hauliers who were still unhappy with the 15% fuel tax cut they had wrested from the government, had been dismantled by midday. </p> <p>Motorists immediately besieged the restocked stations, forming bumper-to-bumper queues and waiting as long as three hours to be served. </p> <p>The hauliers, who wanted a 20% cut in state diesel taxes to compensate the soaring price of crude oil, reluctantly accepted the government's offer after the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, under pressure from his Green party coalition partners, told them it was final. </p> <p>Negotiators from the second biggest French hauliers' group, Unostra, followed those from its sister organisation FNTR on Saturday in recommending its members lift the 160 blockades around the country. </p> <p>The farmers union FNSEU, which won a 30% reduction in state fuel taxes, quickly followed suit. </p> <p>The German lorry drivers have demanded reductions in VAT on fuel, car tax and ecological fuel tax to compensate for the rise in fuel prices. </p> <p>However, German finance minister Hans Eichel ruled out scrapping the ecology tax, one of the chief policy initiatives of Chancellor Schroeder's coalition of Social Democrats and Greens introduced last year. </p> <p>The risk of protests also appeared to be growing elsewhere in Europe.

  "Speed was the crucial factor. The generals and strategists who had planned the rescue mission in minute detail knew full well that if the British troops failed to overpower the rebels swiftly and brutally, the lives of the hostages would almost certainly be lost. The first glimpse of a helicopter could have caused the notoriously volatile West Side Boys to start executing hostages. <p>Within 20 minutes of the mission starting, the hostages were in a helicopter being whisked back to the safety of a British ship anchored off Freetown. Their colleagues - including members of the renowned Parachute Regiment, backed up by the SAS - spent another 70 minutes in sporadic but fierce exchanges. </p> <p>When the battle was over, 25 West Side Boys were dead and 18, including their leader, were captured. One British paratrooper was dead, one was seriously injured and 11 had less severe wounds. </p> <p>Despite the deaths, military chiefs hailed the mission a success, but critics believe that it throws up more questions than it answers - wider questions about the precise nature of the British troops in Sierra Leone and, more specifically, exactly what the captured troops were doing in a rebel-held area. </p> <p>The problems facing the planners of the rescue were legion. One defence chief said it was the \"most complex\" mission carried out by British troops for years. </p> <p>First there was the very difficult terrain. The West Side Boys were based in two camps on either side of the Rokel creek, a 300m-wide river boarded by mangrove swamps, jungle, mud flats and scrubland. They knew the area intimately and were experienced in jungle fighting. They have tended to be portrayed as a bunch of ill-organised youngsters often high on drink and drugs. Yet during the battle, they were well-armed and aggressive. </p> <p><b> Wreaked havoc</b><br> </p> <p> They had set up an effective encampment, straddling both sides of the river. On the northern bank was their headquarters, where the hostages were held, guarded by some 50 or 60 men and women. Another 50 or so were stationed in the village of Magbeni, on the southern bank. </p> <p>British intelligence believed that in the immediate area there were about 200 members of the group. It was impossible for the troops to target only the northern camp, as the southern was equipped with heavy machine guns which could have wreaked havoc on the invaders. A two-pronged helicopter attack with synchronised landings at both camps was considered the best option. </p> <p>The operation began at first light, 6.16am local time. There was just enough light for the five helicopters - two Lynx attack machines and three Chinook troop carriers - which ferried members of the crack 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment into the camps, but enough gloom to give them a degree of protection. In all, 150 British servicemen were involved. The SAS role remains unknown, but it is thought likely that they had been on the ground, supplying information about the rebels, and would almost certainly have joined in the attack. </p> <p>It was crucial that the troops, backed by fire from the Lynx helicopters and using mortars, were able to disembark rapidly and get to the hostages. </p> <p>The helicopters landed within 100 yards of the camps and immediately came under \"sustained fire\", at first from within the village and then from the edges of the jungle when the rebels retreated. </p> <p>Within 20 minutes the hostages were being flown out to safety. Heavy but sporadic gun battles continued for the next hour and a half until British troops secured the area. By mid afternoon all the British troops - along with the three vehicles which had been stolen by the rebels when they took the hostages - had been airlifted out. </p> <p>Twenty five West Side Boys, including three women, were killed. Eighteen, including their leader, \"Brigadier\" Foday Kallay, were captured. </p> <p>The six members of the Royal Irish Regiment, together with five who were subsequently released and a Sierra Leonean official, were captured on August 25. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances. Two days later the West Side Boys issued demands, including the release from prison of a leader named \"Bomb Blast\". </p> <p>After five days of negotiations the army announced that it had secured the release of the five junior members of the British group. The delicate process of negotiation continued. But at the same time plans were being laid to free the hostages forcibly if the talks failed. They had tracked the rebels down to the camps on the Rokel creek - and begun detailed reconnaissance. </p> <p>By the start of last week Tony Blair and the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, were directly involved, discussing the matter with General Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of defence staff, at a cabinet committee meeting. Defence chiefs warned that the rebels' threats to kill the hostages had to be taken seriously - and had been reinforced with \"mock executions\". The army also feared the rebels might move or split up the hostages. </p> <p>Last Tuesday, the MoD sent out soldiers from the elite Parachute Regiment to the region. Defence chiefs urged the press not to dramatise the move, realising that it could spook the West Side Boys. The paras, who had spent some time in Sierra Leone earlier in the summer, flew to Senegal, then began arriving in Freetown on Thursday evening. The Lynx helicopters were brought on Hercules planes and assembled on the spot, and the Chinooks moved from Dakar, capital of Senegal. </p> <p>Permission to mount the rescue was given by Mr Blair last Wednesday from New York, where he was attending the UN millennium summit. </p> <p>It was still hoped that an agreement could be reached. There were discussions with the rebels as late as yesterday, but Mr Kallay returned to his original demands for the release of comrades from prison and the resignation of the Sierra Leone government. He said that if his demands were not met he would take the Britons further inland, implicitly suggesting that they would be handed to the rebel Revolutionary United Front. </p> <p>In the eyes of the British officers present, that amounted to a death threat. </p> <p>There were other worrying signs. The West Side Boys launched an attack on a rival militia on Thursday, prompting a response that took the fighting close to where the British soldiers were held. British negotiators were also disturbed that Mr Kallay was seen wearing a British army uniform, and that a heavily-armed captured Land Rover was used in attacks on the rival militia. </p> <p><b> Powerful message</b><br> </p> <p> The primary aim of the mission was to rescue the hostages. A secondary aim was to capture Mr Kallay, though yesterday ministers insisted that destroying the West Side Boys as a whole was not intended. Besides, intelligence experts had concluded that the organisation was not a coherent whole but a number of independent groups who could not be blasted out of existence in one swoop. The government also wanted to send a \"powerful\" message that it was not acceptable for rebel forces to take British hostages. </p> <p>Mr Blair was contacted again on Saturday afternoon at Chequers to be told further details, and the fact that the raid would start at first light on Sunday morning. He again gave the endorsement. </p> <p>Over the next days and weeks the operation will be dissected in detail. But key among the issues to be addressed is exactly what 11 British soldiers were doing in \"bandit territory\". </p> <p>The army has consistently said that the men, who included a major, a captain and a sergeant major, were on an authorised mission to liaise with Jordanian peacekeepers in the town of Masiaka. But that statement implies that their decision to turn off the main road to Masiaka and head into the hills was not authorised, which leaves open the possibility that they were on an intelligence gathering mission that the army wanted to keep from the UN, or had gone of their own accord. </p> <p>Either way, the officers in charge will find it hard to explain away allowing themselves to be taken hostage by a group of drunken youths.</p>",
  "A British paratrooper was killed and 12 others wounded yesterday when a dawn raid on two jungle villages to rescue hostages in Sierra Leone turned into the biggest firefight involving British forces since the Gulf war. <p>The scale of the casualties raised questions about Britain's involvement in the West African civil war, but ministers were adamant last night that there would be no pull-out. </p> <p>The raid, led by the Parachute Regiment and the SAS and codenamed Operation Barras, rescued the six British soldiers and one Sierra Leoneon held hostage deep in the jungle since last month by the renegade faction the West Side Boys. </p> <p>The battle of Rokel Creek lasted 90 minutes, at the end of which 25 members of the West Side Boys were dead and 18 captured, including their leader, the self-styled brigadier Foday Kallay. </p> <p>A high proportion of the West Side Boys are child soldiers and women. It was confirmed last night that three women were among the dead. </p> <p>The 150 British troops arrived by helicopter and boat before 6.30am at two villages in the Occra Hills, about 50 miles from the capital Freetown, taking advantage of the poor light and early hour to surprise the West Side Boys, who had threatened to execute the hostages if they heard a helicopter. </p> <p>The paratroopers targeted two villages, Magbeni and Gberi Bana, either side of the wide Rokel Creek. </p> <p>The hostages were being kept on the south bank, less than a mile east of Magbeni. </p> <p>The army said it met considerable resistance from the West Side Boys and that there was a \"significant exchange of fire\" in which the paratrooper was killed. While the hostages were secured, two Chinook helicopters fought to keep the West Side Boys at bay. The helicopters then attacked the villages and pursued the fighters into the jungle. </p> <p>The hostages were flown to a navy supply ship after 20 minutes but the fighting continued for an hour and a half. One of the Britons was said to be seriously injured. </p> <p>The British commander, General Sir Charles Guthrie, said: \"The West Side Boys were not a pushover. They fought very hard.\" </p> <p>He added: \"This kind of operation is never without risk. We are not playing some stupid arcade game.\" </p> <p>Explaining the background to the decision to go in, the British commander in Sierra Leone, Brigadier Gordon Hughes, said: \"We had lost contact with the West Side Boys for a number of days. When contact was resumed [on Saturday] their unreasonable demands indicated that the captives were at extreme risk.\" </p> <p>Tony Blair agreed in principle to the rescue on Wednesday and gave a final go-ahead to Sir Charles on Saturday. Speaking from Chequers, the prime minister said: \"The operation was authorised once it became clear to us that the negotiations for their release were not being carried out in good faith and the lives of the hostages were in danger.\" </p> <p>The ministry of defence said the West Side Boys had begun carrying out mock executions. </p> <p>Mr Blair added: \"I think we can be proud of the armed forces, there really are no finer armed forces anywhere in the world.\" </p> <p>The Conservatives called for all British troops to be withdrawn because of the high risk involved in the civil war and because the British contingent, only 300-strong, was too small. The remaining West Side Boys, numbering more than 400, will now target British forces, regarding it as a blood feud. </p> <p>The foreign office minister, Peter Hain, brushed aside Tory demands: \"This is precisely the moment it is important to hold your nerve. If the West Side Boys had got away with this, it could have opened the floodgates to further hostage-taking. </p> <p>\"I'm surprised and saddened at this irresponsible demand which breaks the traditional all-party support for operations by our forces. </p> <p>\"Britain would not be respected if we were diverted from our policy when there are difficulties, nor would we be respected if we deserted our friends in difficulty. </p> <p>Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, rejected suggestions that the army had underestimated the West Side Boys. He said: \"These are not drug-crazed individuals. They have fought a very determined fight and clearly are very capable.\" </p> <p>The six rescued British soldiers, from the Royal Irish Regiment, were flown to HMS Sir Percivale off Freetown. They were said to be physically and mentally exhausted. </p> <p>They were being debriefed by the army last night on how they had been taken hostage by an indisciplined gang. Five others who had been released earlier by the hostages were unable to offer an explanation, saying they had only been following their officer. </p> <p>Their capture, on August 25, was regarded by the MoD as a national humiliation. The successful rescue operation has helped restore British credibility in Sierra Leone. </p> <p>The hostages had been held in mud and bamboo huts in a mosquito-infested swamp area. Their commanding officer, Colonel Simon Fordham, said they were unharmed, but had been held under \"very poor conditions\". </p> <p>He added: \"They did their best to look after themselves as best they could. They looked remarkably well considering the ordeal they have been under.\" </p> <p>Those rescued phoned their families. A spokesman for the families said later that their joy at the release was overshadowed by news of the death of one Briton. </p> <p>An MoD statement attempted to put the fatality in context: \"Casualties are regrettable but are at the low end of the scale for such a difficult and complex operation.\"</p>",
  "The British government is braced for keeping forces in Sierra Leone for years in spite of setbacks such as yesterday's firefight that resulted in British casualties. <p>The bloody operation to rescue hostages was not seen by ministers yesterday as a reason to bring the small contingent of soldiers home. \"We will not be deflected. We always expected there were going to be incidents like this,\" one said. </p> <p>The intervention in May was a moral one. But the hostage-taking and the subsequent bloodletting raises legitimate questions about British involvement. Did Britain blunder by pulling out the bulk of its forces too soon in June? Is the contingent it left behind too small for the job it is being asked to do? And why is Britain not operating under the UN flag, as other countries are doing? </p> <p>Two weeks ago ministers and officials from the foreign, defence, overseas development and other departments met in Whitehall to discuss involvement in Sierra Leone against the background of the 11 British soldiers having been taken hostage. </p> <p>The meeting had been scheduled before the hostage-taking and was born out of wider concerns: some officials privately questioned whether ministers had a credible strategy in place that would allow Britain eventually to pull out of the country with honour. </p> <p>British policy is being driven by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who was deeply affected by the sight of thousands of limbless victims of the rebel Revolutionary United Front on a visit to Freetown in June. </p> <p>All options, no matter how extreme, were discussed at the meeting. Some were raised and dismissed almost immediately, such as a huge offensive of Nato-style proportions to wrest control of the diamond-producing areas from the RUF, denying them their prime source of income. In the end ministers opted to stick basically with the strategy they have been working on since pulling out the bulk of forces in June. </p> <p>The strategy is to have a contingent of about 300, and to train the Sierra Leone army (SLA) to a standard at which it will be capable of defending Freetown and making inroads into the rebel heartlands, the diamond-producing areas that fund the war. </p> <p>It is a daunting task - but no less daunting is the other half of the strategy: hoping that the chaotic UN peacekeeping force can get its act together sufficiently to bolster the SLA when it eventually goes into action. </p> <p>It was UN fear that the RUF was about to capture Freetown again in May that led to British intervention. As it turned out, the fear was misplaced. But the presence of British troops did temporarily instil confidence in the SLA and the UN peackeeping force. </p> <p>The British commander who led the intervention in May, Brigadier David Richards, set about welding the various pro-government military factions into a single army. That included the West Side Boys, who initially fought hard and with results under what was euphemistically described as the \"guidance\" of a British officer. </p> <p>The British helped provide a perception of strength. Their Harriers, flying low over RUF territory, provided a frightening form of intimidation for many of the rebels. The image of strength permeated pro-government forces even though they were poorly trained and ill-equipped, raising morale and shaking the RUF's confidence. Even the UN started to look as if it was in Sierra Leone to do more than enjoy the beaches. </p> <p>But when the British withdrew most of their forces in mid-June, the strategy started to fall apart. Pro-government fighters suffered a number of setbacks, and even turned their guns on each other on occasions. The UN decided it was not going to be so robust after all. </p> <p>More UN troops are on the way but it is not numbers that matter but quality, and the ability to work together. There is a serious lack of both, as the Guardian revealed on Saturday in a leaked report from the Indian commander, General Vijay Jetley, who accused the Nigerian army of wanting to control the UN force as a cover for diamond smuggling. The Nigerian military yesterday called for the removal of Gen Jetley, describing him as \"incompetent, lacking in courage\" and as having lost control of UN forces. </p> <p>The UN needs support, so why is the British force not operating under the UN flag? It is mainly because British forces are small, and it was not thought worth putting such a minor force under UN control. Also, the UN force was originally conceived as being mainly African, and British troops only joined in May.</p>",
  "The TUC yesterday demanded that the government acts to end the scandal of boardroom greed and to close the widening gap between company directors' pay and the salaries of their employees. <p>Labelling company boardrooms \"Britain's closed shops\", unions warned that they would urge fund managers and other shareholders to vote against excessive top pay packages or, ultimately, boycott company products.</p> <p>TUC research shows that last year the highest paid directors of the top 1,000 companies earned 20.7 times the average salary of their employees, compared with 15.7 times in 1994.

  "Twelve holes have been found in the roof of the Millennium Dome as the minister responsible for the fiasco last night again faced renewed calls for his resignation. <p>Lord Falconer looked increasingly beleaguered as Downing Street refused to be drawn on whether Tony Blair and his family, who still have not visited the attraction, would ever make their way to Greenwich. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson, the Labour minister initially responsible for the dome, yesterday declined to take the blame for the project's failure. </p> <p>Speaking on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost he said: \"If there have been mistakes more recently or this year then they should certainly be an inquiry into those. They should be examined and they should be brought out.\" </p> <p>He later qualified his remarks, which could have been interpreted as a poor defence of Lord Falconer, by saying if there had been any mistakes, they were made by managers. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson said since 1998 he had been just a bystander and blamed the lower than expected visitors on media fury against the project. </p> <p>He also qualified Labour's responsibility by asserting the decisions on design, location and conception had all been made by the previous Conservative government. </p> <p>The shadow culture secretary, Peter Ainsworth, again called for Lord Falconer's head after saying he should have been aware the dome's costs were \"out of control\" as long as as nine months ago when he was shown a report by Deloitte &amp; Touche, the auditors hired by the millennium commission to monitor finances. </p> <p>He said copies of the reports would have been passed to the minister, a close friend of Mr Blair, so he could not pretend that he did not know. </p> <p>\"These reports and figures must be published,\" Mr Ainsworth said. \"It is the public's money which has been thrown at this disastrous failure. They have the right to know why.\" </p> <p>The auditors have produced a number of reports for the commission - which last week bailed out the dome with an extra \u00a347m of national lottery money to bring its running total to \u00a3839m - the latest of which apparently backed up the critical evaluation by PricewaterhouseCoopers which led to the appointment of troubleshooter David James. </p> <p>The millennium commission has refused to publicise the reports until after a national audit office report is published next month. But it is thought that Deloitte &amp; Touche put the original likely attendance at the dome at only 8m, 4m less than the number the dome claimed it would attract. </p> <p>The New Millennium Experience Company, which runs the dome, has always maintained that it needed 10m to break even. </p> <p>Yesterday an NMEC spokesman confirmed that six \"dinner plate-sized holes\" in the Teflon-coated roof of the dome had been patched but denied reports that it had cost up to \u00a314m. \"That's nonsense. The roof is under guarantee so the repairs have all come under that.\" </p> <p>He said the holes, which include a larger one over the entrance itself, were caused by cranes puncturing the tent while the contents were being put in place. </p> <p>\"These sort of accidents happen,\" he said. \"They are really small beer. Birdair, the American company responsible for putting it up, have made the repairs. \"There are a handful of other holes as well but these are having no effect on the dome. They're very small so we're just leaving them for the moment.\" </p> <p>He added that the punctures should be seen in context. \"The dome is the biggest roof in the world. </p> <p>\"It is a 25-acre surface and these holes would be like pinpricks when you compare them to the scale of a normal house.\" </p> <p>The spokesman confirmed that Birdair have given a 25-year guarantee on the roof, five years less than the assurances first given by Mr Mandelson, who insisted the dome would last for more than 30 years and could possibly survive for half a century. </p> <p>Despite Lord Rogers's revolutionary design, the roof has never lived up to his vision of a pristine shallow orb. Design problems with the Teflon coating meant it attracted dirt and even in the early days visitors complained about how grubby it looked.</p>",
  "Police investigating the murder of the Belfast solicitor Patrick Finucane 11 years ago are planning to arrest and interview under caution more than two dozen former members of the force research unit, a shadowy intelligence outfit which ran army agents. <p>Detectives involved in the Stevens inquiry, also probing allegations of security force collusion in terrorist murders, planned the move after the army granted its request for thousands of secret documents last month. </p> <p>Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan police commissioner, is heading his third inquiry into events linked to the Ulster Defence Association's shooting of Patrick Finucane in front of his family in his north Belfast home in February 1989.

  "According to Peter Mandelson, speaking to the party faithful last Saturday, the name New Labour defines the distinguishing feature of the government - a restless quest for new ideas and unflagging enthusiasm for reform. Unfortunately, Sunday's papers suggested that it bears a different trademark. The headlines announced that the party's high command is engaged in unremitting civil war. Blair snubs Mowlam. Mowlam smears Brown. Brown defies Blair. And Mr Mandelson himself pops in and out of the political undergrowth like a guerrilla striking a swift blow before he disappears back into the landscape. <p>I do not doubt the stories' truth. Mo Mowlam, announcing that she checked the facts of Julia Langdon's biography, confirmed them. Other governments have behaved in just the same way. John Major, not realising that his comments were recorded, called four members of his own cabinet \"bastards\" and suggested that one of his backbenchers should be accompanied by \"men in white coats\". The problem for Mr Blair is that he and his colleagues were expected to behave differently. New Labour was above such things. </p> <p>That is why, at least to a degree, Mr Mandelson is right. The organisation that he helped to found, after the real Labour party died with John Smith, is defined by image and attitude not ideology. So we must expect that the arguments that divide its members are more concerned with presentation than philosophy. The cabinet in which I served was deeply split over economic and industrial policy - the application for an IMF loan and the imposition of wages policy on the trade unions. We argued about those issues fiercely (and sometimes bitterly). That left us neither time nor energy to worry about the PM treating a colleague like a tea lady or the propriety of the chancellor speaking to the press without notifying Number 10. </p> <p> No doubt Mr Blair would argue - with a degree of justification - that it is better for the cabinet to be split by personal animosities than by doctrinal disputes. But the notion that ministers do not like each other is deeply damaging to the favourable image by which the party's leaders set such store. The damning question asked about Labour in the 70s and the Tories 20 years later was: \"If they cannot agree amongst themselves, how can they run the country?\" It will be repeated time after time because of the personal antagonisms that have been revealed this week. </p> <p>Ironically, those revelations are, at least in part, the results of Tony Blair's determination to avoid even the suggestion of a split. Cabinet meetings now last for less than an hour. One senior minister complained that circulating papers for discussion with colleagues is regarded as disloyalty; everything has to be decided in \"one-to-one\" meetings with the prime minister. The devil finds work for idle tongues. Politicians who are prevented from arguing about serious subjects will find solace in trivia. </p> <p>All governments try to hide disagreements. But at least disputes about how to reduce poverty, improve education and end discrimination can be justified by the claim that they are prompted by beliefs too deeply held to be suppressed. The discovery that the chancellor's press secretary was told to moderate the Treasury's antagonism to early entry into the euro and answered: \"Sorry Tony, it's too late,\" suggests a government that is not wholly in control of events. Since only half a dozen people were present when the impertinence was uttered, it also makes plain that New Labour's obsession with media management is out of control. Members of the government (and their servants) are managing the media against each other. </p> <p>The revelations of the last two days will make little difference to Mr Blair's prospects of a second term. And the PM is entitled to recall that the last Labour government, which I boast spent its time disputing policy options, lost the general election of 1979. So, if re-election is all that matters, yesterday's revelations are no more than an irritant. Winning is important. But it is not, or should not be, all that a party is about. Almost every new fact that we learn about this government confirms that everything is subordinate to that single aim. </p> <p>It is not only Mr Blair who holds that view. Last Friday the prime minister made a speech about comprehensive education that most Labour party members must have recognised as ignorant nonsense. Commentators were unanimous in the view that it was intended to restore his radical reputation. Yet there has been no protest either against the caricature of our secondary schools or in favour of education speeches being made out of interest in education rather than concern for image. The moral of this week is that New Labour argues about too little not too much - and usually about the wrong subject.</p>",
  "<p>Have the gates to the developed world clanged shut for good? The obstacles to new countries joining East Asian tigers such as Taiwan and South Korea have piled up.The path to development has never looked so steep. </p> <p>Fifty years ago, Korea was poorer than Sudan. Its main export was wigs made with human hair. Today it is an industrial leader, shrugging off a financial crisis in 1998. Taiwan has achieved the unique feat of combining high-speed growth with one of the fairest distributions of income in the world. </p> <p>At least until the onset of the Asian financial crisis, the World Bank attempted to claim the tigers as success stories for free market economics. In fact, countries such as Malaysia, Korea and Taiwan proved adept at combining a high level of state intervention in allocating credit, nurturing new industries and acquiring new technology, with the strengths of market forces in encouraging competition and efficiency. Above all, the East Asian \"miracles\" have been built on a clear industrial policy aimed at developing locally owned industries, if necessary through protection and laws which give them privileges compared to foreign investors. </p> <p>But are these lessons still relevant? \"Doing a Korea\" is becoming increasingly difficult. The speed and scale of technological innovation is accelerating, making it harder for poor countries to reach the \"technological frontier\" as Korea did in the 1970s thanks to massive state support for its nascent hi-tech industries. These days it costs billions to develop a new product, and firms have only a few years (sometimes only months) to recoup the investment. The costs of failure are huge. </p> <p>It is harder for developing countries to acquire and adapt the latest technology as international patent law has become more restrictive. Protectionism may be out of favour in trade, but it is alive and well in the knowledge economy. </p> <p>Most worryingly, the international system governing trade and investment is closing down the ability of poor-country governments to follow the kind of policies that lay behind the East Asian miracle. Countries which have opened up to international capital markets find themselves at the mercy of that elusive entity \"market confidence\". Any step away from the Washington free market consensus can trigger a mood-swing among investors and a run on the currency. As one Brazilian economist observed: \"Here the people get to vote every four years, the markets every four seconds.\" </p> <p>Structural adjustment programmes, often imposed on countries by the IMF and World Bank, have opened up economies to foreign trade and investment, reducing the levels of protection for local industries. These days, the World Trade Organisation covers much more than trade, since barriers to trade can comprise almost anything a government does inside its own borders, such as subsidies, investment laws or tax regimes. For WTO officials, the fact that governments are prohibited from reversing free market reforms bar exceptional circumstances prevents states falling prey to vested interests. It can just as easily prevent them from doing what is best for their people. </p> <p>Pessimists conclude that the rich countries have pulled up the ladder behind them, using the global trading system to keep poor countries in their place as providers of raw materials and cheap labour. Optimists point out that the WTO still leaves plenty of options open, such as funding research, or setting up science parks for fledgling companies. The real dangers are twofold. The first is that, if developing country governments swallow the story that only deregulation and market forces are permitted, they will fail to exploit the room for manoeuvre that still exists. </p> <p>The second is what happens next at the WTO. Once the US elections are over, the rich countries will return to the negotiating table abandoned at Seattle. They want agreements on areas that could severely reduce the remaining space for national development policies - for example, barring governments from favouring local companies in their procurement policies or setting even tighter rules against different treatment for foreign over national investors. </p> <p>Campaigners, north and south, should be making the case for an international system that protects and encourages, rather than undermines, national development strategies. </p> <p> Duncan Green is a policy analyst at Cafod, the Catholic aid agency</p>",
  "On a day's stalking through the ancient pine forest of the Strathspey estate, Frank Law's journey would once have been brightened by the sight of dozens of capercaillies brooding in the trees or feeding on blaeberries. <p>But now the game manager rarely spots Britain's largest game bird. </p> <p>Over the last few decades the decline of the capercaillie has been dramatic. As recently as the 1970s, there were around 20,000 capercaillies flying through Scotland's pine woodlands. Today there are only 1,000 left in the bird's habitat, east of the Great Glen. </p> <p>\"It's not so long ago that capercaillies were considered a pest,\" says Mr Law. \"Then, by the start of the 80s, they became a much rarer sight. Even before the scientists came along, we knew there was a problem.\" </p> <p>The problem now is critical. Conservationists are currently losing the battle: the capercaillie is declining at a rate of 16% per year. If that is trend continues, the bird will disappear from Scotland's woodlands in about 10 years. </p> <p>\"It is on the verge of disappearing from Scotland,\" says Kenny Kortland, the RSPB's capercaillie project officer. </p> <p>One of the greatest threats to the distinctive bird - the male has black and deep green plumage relieved only by a scarlet patch around the eye - is recent change to Scotland's climate. Colder and wetter Aprils mean blaeberry, the ca percaillie's favourite food, does not grow at the time when the female bird needs it most. The lack of proper nutrients results in weaker chicks and the chicks have been then hampered by wet and cold summers. </p> <p>Deaths of capercaillie adults, however, remain one of the biggest threats. </p> <p>Since the 1960s, Scotland's deer population has exploded. The sight of a stag roaming through the glens may be a shortbread tin image of Scotland but they cause major damage to woodlands. Estate owners, however, are generally reluctant to keep deer numbers down. </p> <p>It is a matter of economics: the more deer for shooting, the more valuable the estate. But the deer population means forests are stripped and new trees are not given the opportunity to grow. </p> <p>To get round this, estate owners resort to erecting mile after mile of fences around woods. These fences are the greatest man made threat to the capercaillie. </p> <p>\"The capers fly relatively low, and they get up a fair bit of speed, and they smack right into them,\" said Mr Kortland. </p> <p>About 8% of adults die on the fences and one quarter of chicks die on them. The forestry commission has helped to remove 120km of fencing in the past few years but it is not enough. </p> <p>There are further worries about fragmentation of the habitat. Capercaillies need large areas. On the RSPB's Speyside estate of Abernethy, one of the greatest priorities is recreating the capercaillie's natural habitat. Trees are planted to allow the birds to fly freely, deer are culled so fencing is not needed, and blaeberries flourish. </p> <p>\"This is the ideal for the caper but we can't hope to recreate this across Scotland,\" says Mr Kortland. \"What we have got to do, though, is persuade the estates of the benefits of looking after the caper. </p> <p>\"After all, it's near the top of the food chain. If we can't keep that there's not much hope for a lot of other things.\" <br><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\"> RSPB website</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.the-soc.fsnet.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Scottish Ornithologists Club</a></p>",

  "Palestinian leaders put their people's dream of statehood on ice yesterday, at the same time keeping the peace process alive by postponing a declaration of independence that had been fixed for Wednesday. <p>The PLO's central committee said it would meet again on November 15 to discuss ways of putting Palestine on the map, short of declaring a state, such as drafting a constitution, and seeking entry to the United Nations. </p> <p>Such pledges will not diminish the bitter disappointment felt by most Palestinians at the decision to defer statehood once again - seven years after the start of the peace process. But the move by Palestine's mini parliament does give negotiators some breathing room to try to reach a final settlement with Israel. </p> <p>\"We have to look at what is important to our people here on Palestinian land,\" said Mohammed Nashashibi, the Palestinian finance minister. \"The date is not important for the people.\" </p> <p>Mr Nashashibi said Palestinian officials would press Israel in negotiations, which are to resume today, for control of international borders and natural resources, especially water, and access to world markets. </p> <p>The Palestinian decision was forced by Israeli opposition to a unilateral declaration, given teeth by the threat of its prime minister, Ehud Barak, to annex territory in the West Bank and Gaza where the Palestinians have had self-rule for six years. That threat - and the fear of a spiral of violence - also extinguished international support for a declaration on September 13. </p> <p>Still, Mr Nashashibi insisted: \"There is no such thing as half a state. We are on our way to full sovereignty, and there is no turning back. Peace is coming whether we like it or not.\" </p> <p>But to Palestinians that means a state with East Jerusalem as its capital - a concession the Israelis are loath to grant, especially when it involves holy places. </p> <p>The aspiration is made tangible in the statue of the unknown Palestinian soldier in Gaza's main square, whose assault rifle is pointed towards the holy city. </p> <p>For ordinary Palestinians, the delay is a crushing blow. They have their own tricolour flag, which flies over Gaza and parts of the West Bank, their own cult of personality in the portraits of Yasser Arafat plastered almost everywhere, a form of parliament, a police force, and even a national airline - with three planes. But without agreed borders, they lack the very basics of statehood. </p> <p>\"Only when we declare a state can we get our rights. Israel is playing with us like a ball, and the world does not give a damn,\" said Tahsin al-Dera, in Palestine Square in Gaza. </p> <p>Members of the central committee had said earlier that they would not put off independence indefinitely. </p> <p>\"We do not want to keep this delay open-ended because this will let Barak carry out all his plans, and we will be stuck in self-rule forever,\" said Salim Zanoun, the head of the CC, who had argued against the delay. </p> <p>Prospects for a breakthrough in the next four weeks of secret talks now look increasingly dim, with the two sides deadlocked on the question of Jerusalem. Several members of the central committee said they had given up hope of an agreement until after President Clinton leaves office in January. </p> <p>\"I am waiting for the day that the administration of President Clinton and the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, will end,\" said Hani al-Hassan, secretary-general of Mr Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO. </p> <p>\"So long as the president represents the Israeli point of view, how can we reach an agreement? It is clear he is not a neutral man.\" </p> <p>Although Israel reacted favourably to the expected delay of a declaration of independence, the acting foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, was not optimistic. \"I don't see that the chance [of a final peace being reached] is all that great,\" he told Army Radio.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Hobson's Choice</strong> </p> <p>(David Lean, 1954) </p> <p>5pm, Carlton Cinema </p> <p>Delightful screen version of Harold Brighouse's stage comedy, filmed in Salford. It's beautifully played, with Charles Laughton as the overbearing, boozy bootmaker tied up in knots by eldest daughter Brenda de Banzie and her dim but lovable husband, John Mills. Funny, and warm as a ferret up a trouser leg. </p> <p><strong> The Craft</strong> </p> <p>(Andrew Fleming, 1996) </p> <p>8pm, FilmFour </p> <p>With its four teenage girls ganging up to challenge their outsider status at a posh LA college, the references come thick and fast in this funny supernatural tale - Heathers meets Witches Of Eastwick by way of Carrie. Robin Tunney is the new girl at school whose telekinetic powers bring her into the orbit of punkette Fairuza Balk, the scarred Neve Campbell, and Rachel True, a black victim of racism. Together they form a coven and start to exact revenge, with some genuinely chilling tricks up their sleeves. </p> <p><strong> The Omen</strong> </p> <p>(Richard Donner, 1976) </p> <p>11.35pm, FilmFour </p> <p>More black magic. When people call young Damien a little devil, they ain't kidding. The adopted son of American ambassador Gregory Peck (Charlton Heston was first choice) and Lee Remick has an impish sense of humour, making his nanny hang herself, for instance. But then, Damien is the son of Satan. Quality horror, this; scary without overly resorting to gore, the hair-raising Ave Satani screeching away in the background and a cast including David Warner, Billie Whitelaw and Leo McKern that takes it seriously. </p> <p><strong> Afterglow </strong></p> <p>(Alan Rudolph, 1997) </p> <p>1.25am, Sky Premier </p> <p>Leisurely, painfully comic study of two failing marriages. Jonny Lee Miller is young, ambitious, sure that everything is fine at home; but sexually frustrated wife Lara Flynn Boyle is far from happy and instantly attracted to philandering repairman Nick Nolte, husband of Julie Christie's fragile ex-movie actress. The relationships are finely drawn in indie director Rudolph's witty, perceptive script. </p>",
  "<p>Rupert Murdoch's Sky TV promised - at its launch in the mid-80s - to be a new kind of television network for Britain. This turned out to be true, although viewers didn't perhaps realise the novelty would be that the network was devoid of its own ideas. The schedule consisted of attractive American acquisitions (The Simpsons, Friends, etc) and canny acts of blackmail in which viewers were forced to buy satellite dishes to see football or cricket which had previously been beamed to their aerials. </p> <p>But now Sky seems finally to have developed artistic ambitions. For the first time, the company is originating expensive entertainment series. Harry Enfield's Brand Spanking New Show is the first example of a major star in the BBC and ITV galaxy agreeing to go extra-terrestrial. </p> <p>This had seemed a strange decision by Enfield. At the same time he sought a larger audience than the BBC - with his first cinema release Kevin And Perry Go Large - he was prepared to accept the much smaller satellite audience. A viewing of the first two episodes, however, makes Enfield's reasoning explicit - explicit being the key word - and suggests that it is a little early for Rupert Murdoch to claim cultural respectability. </p> <p>The series introduces 25 characters, and the most prominent is the Frank Pharmacist, a South African running a London pharmacy. At first the intent seems to be political - he is rude to his non-white assistant - but in fact the nationality seems only to follow from a linguistic connection between Boer-ish and boorish. </p> <p>The joke is that while chemists are generally known for their discretion, this pharmacist bellows a monologue combining clinical detail with playground scatalogy. Returning with a cure for diarrhoea, a middle-class woman is quizzed on the firmness of her \"turds\" and \"stools\" after the \"real bowl-splatterers\" caused by her condition. A young man flirting with another customer is unmanned when the chemist returns to deafeningly check whether the herpes cream he needs is for the oral or genital sort. </p> <p>The second stand-out character is a Cornish fisherman who boasts in the snug-bar about the awesome intercourse and other acts he has achieved with most of the world's famous beauties. The target here is presumably male sexual boasting but the main point of these sketches seems to be to allow Enfield to explore the vocabulary of the bedroom in the way that the dentist liberated the language of the bathroom. </p> <p>These two loose-lipped creations establish that Harry Enfield's Brand Spanking New Show is not about Rupert Murdoch becoming respectable but Harry Enfield courting unrespectability. In one of the show's best jokes, he is using Sky One as a sort of comedic page three. Other comics - Mike Reid, Alan Davies, Frank Skinner - have used video or nightclubs to do this stuff. Enfield - with amusing subversiveness - is using the television channel of a man whose British newspapers often campaign against filth on TV. </p> <p>But, except in vocabulary, the rest of the show confirms Enfield's talents rather than extending them. The comedian once did the voices on Spitting Image and he remains an impressionist in the sense that his characters derive from a distinct verbal delivery. The difference is that while Rory Bremner and Alastair McGowan impersonate the famous, Enfield does non-celebrity social types with occasional exceptions. The new series shows this to be a common-sense policy - his portrayal of the footballer is one of his weakest. </p> <p>Because he begins with accent, Enfield's subject as a comedian is essentially class. But, in the class war, he fights on both sides. </p> <p>Characters from Ascot and the dog-track, Hampstead and Hackney are \"paired\" like absentee MPs so that they cancel out any political message. For Loadsamoney (thick and grasping working-class), there was Tim Nice But Dim (thick and complacent upper-class). In the new series, there's a revolting rich businessman called Edward Carmichael, who, in a good example of Enfield's sharp ear, has a habit of barracking the answers of others with a chorus of \"yuh, yuh, yuh\" which betrays his irritation at the wait until he can dominate the conversation again. But he faces across the Commons of Enfield's imagination Short Bloke, a yob who compensates for lack of height by picking fights in pubs. </p> <p>Like The Fast Show - the other mainstream comic hit of the 90s - Enfield uses an accent and a catch-phrase to create what might be called karaoke comedy: the routines are easily repeated in offices and pubs next day. He also shares with The Fast Show the favourite device of having people say in a social situation what they would generally only think. </p> <p>His filthy pharmacist and lurid Cornishman are examples of this. His Paxman simply tells ministers to \"fuck off\". His long-term married couple making love actually read the newspapers and look at carpet samples in the middle of the act rather than their minds wandering off. </p> <p>And the series itself invites this cynical simultaneous translation. The comedian may have said that his decision showed that Sky One had arrived as a network but the truth is that the Digger lets him do some filth </p> <p>\u0095 Harry Enfield, tonight, 10pm, Sky One</p>",
  "<p>The Handsome Family are at the forefront of a distinctly urban new wave of country music, known as alt.country or insurgent country, that has grown up in the bars of Chicago. But hear a few songs by this husband-and-wife team, and you imagine them hunting squirrels in the backwoods. Their recent CD, In the Air, is so brimming with nature that you feel it should have been recorded on a chunk of mighty redwood, rather than on the brittle plastic of a compact disc. Dogs leap, birds sing, cicadas hiss and many things die. </p> <p>\"I'm kind of obsessed with the two sides of nature,\" says lyricist Rennie Sparks. \"The beautiful, tranquil side of it, like, 'Oh, look at that cute little kitten.' And the really horrible, dangerous and bloodthirsty side of it, like, 'Boy, that alligator ate that zebra in one bite!' I watch a lot of nature shows on TV where it's just all one big bloodbath.\" </p> <p>Rennie and husband Brett, who writes the music and sings most of the songs, are perhaps a little too morbid for mainstream American tastes. They have often been referred to as the Manson family or the Addams family by less kind reviewers who fail to see the beauty in Rennie's macabre lyrics. </p> <p>Their previous CD, Through the Trees (1998), was the darkest recording to come out of the US this side of death metal. It opened with a track featuring the downbeat chorus: \"This is why people OD on pills and jump from the Golden Gate Bridge\" and closed with the true story of Brett's stay in a mental hospital, with him strapped to a bed quoting Nietzsche. In 1995, during the recording of their second CD, Milk and Scissors, Brett's manic depression had taken such a hold that Rennie was forced to check him in to the hospital for his own protection. He was spending wildly, drinking heavily and had taken to eating cat food. </p> <p>\"I was delusional,\" he says. \"Incapable of getting anything done. I really thought I was the Messiah. I was writing my own bible and starting fires in the apartment. I was a fucking lunatic. I would go two weeks at a time without sleeping, I was down to about 145lb. So I went to the nut-house for a few weeks. They put me on lithium, among other things. Long-term lithium, which I am still taking to this day.\" Rennie has also had her own share of problems with depression and thoughts of suicide and, like Brett, is still taking the pills. Religion seems to loom large over the work of the Handsome Family. Brett was brought up a southern Baptist, and it was in church that he learned about music and how to sing in such a delightfully doomy baritone. He has also been influenced by the Louvin Brothers, a 50s Christian country act whose cautionary tales were every bit as dark as the Handsome Family's. </p> <p>Rennie was brought up a Jew in New York but has also dabbled with some less than orthodox spiritual beliefs, as revelealed in the lyrics for When That Helicopter Comes - the story of the second coming, with helicopters taking the place of Jesus. \"I've always been obsessed with helicopters,\" she says. \"When I was little I thought God was a helicopter. I had all these feelings that after I died I would turn into a helicopter.\" </p> <p>It is surprising to learn that lurking behind the rolling hills and falling trees of In the Air is the latest in technology. The couple may have recorded the album in their living room, but it was all done on a Macintosh G3 computer - hardly a traditional piece of country kit. But then, neither was the drum machine that regimented their previous album and was intended to alienate traditionalists in the alt.country scene. \"It was completely out of spite,\" says Brett. \"Musically it did work, but I thought that people would be really critical of it. But that record was on every critic's top 10 list in the US last year. It surprised the hell out of me.\" </p> <p>Oddly, Chicago's country revival was largely kick-started by two ex-pat members of Leeds art-punks the Mekons, who now live in the city. Jon Langford seems to be at the centre of any drunken guitar-led stomp worthy of mention with his various bands, such as the Waco Brothers, who evoke the spirit of Johnny Cash before he was born again. </p> <p>The morality tales of Rennie's lyrics are not lost on Brett, who at least seems to have learned to go a little steady on the drink. \"My classic joke is that if I get drunk and act like an asshole, then Rennie's going to write a song about it and I'm going to have to sing it over and over,\" he says. \"My punishment is having her pull my spiritual trousers down every night.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Handsome Family play the Charlotte, Leicester (0116-255 3956), tonight; Maguires, Leeds (0113-245 5630), tomorrow; the Louisana, Bristol (0117-926 5978), on Wednesday, then tour.</p>",
  "<p>When regulators come knocking on your door you had better be ready. Last week we received a letter from the financial services authority. This is the body responsible for supervising banking and deposit taking activity and therefore has an interest in \"payment gateways\" such as us. </p> <p>A letter from a regulatory body is enough to cause a few butterflies but we were confident of our position. We know we are operating in a complex legal environment. Regulations within the financial services sector tend to be tighter and more numerous than elsewhere and the service that we provide needs to comply with the Banking Acts and legislation on money laundering. </p> <p>We have spent a tidy sum on lawyers who are experts in financial services. It is the third biggest area of expenditure for us to date, after systems and staff. What our learned friends turned up changed the nature of our business. </p> <p>We could have offered credit ourselves; but on our lawyers' advice we will be operating the payments gateway in partnership with a number of licensed deposit takers - that is, banks. </p> <p>If this had not been a legal requirement we would have been technically capable of launching the service months ago (although we do have other, strategic reasons for partnering with banks). As it is, integration with banks means that the solution takes longer to develop, not just because banks tend to be slow-moving. On the upside, the added complexity is likely to provide us with some protection from new entrants in what is rapidly becoming a highly competitive online payments environment. </p> <p>It is not clear that all new online businesses are receiving the same quality of legal advice. The internet is still a relatively new phenomenon and it has given many professionals the opportunity to position themselves as experts in the field without the requisite amount of experience. As the saying goes, you don't know what you don't know. </p> <p>We came across many of these supposed experts when we were searching for lawyers - some whose actual expertise stretched only to drawing up terms and conditions for a straightforward e-commerce site. </p> <p>Our recent conversations with the FSA have confirmed that even some of the players in the complex and sensitive field of electronic payments have not necessarily been receiving proper legal advice. </p> <p>This deficiency could prove costly for investors and business partners, particularly as regulators start to focus more keenly on this area. </p> <p> Adam Hamdy and Guy Mallison are co-founders of rools.com a new service that enables teenagers to shop online</p>",

His counterpart at CSFB manages more than 500 people.</p> <p>CSFB's ambitions to enter the global super league of companies in the bulge bracket -firms which have cashed in on mergers and acquisitions by acting for both parties involved - are likely to mean that some effort will be expended in trying to keep highly rated members of staff at DLJ, including Mr Sants.</p> <p>European executives are understood to want to adopt an \"orderly\" approach to the lay-offs, citing employment legislation for a relatively \"softly, softly\" approach.</p> <p>A bigger challenge may be trying to retain the bankers who relished DLJ's boutique-style of operation.

  "Any thought that the aftermath of Nato's Kosovan imbroglio might have dimmed Tony Blair's enthusiasm for \"humanitarian wars\" has been dispelled. His government has emerged as the most interventionist British administration since decolonisation. No opportunity is now to be passed up, it seems, to raise the 21st-century crusader's flag across the globe. <p>The increasingly grim Sierra Leone adventure, with its kidnappings and yesterday's bloodstained, military rescue, is the third time in 18 months that New Labour has used British armed force outside UN control. Sierra Leone has also been the biggest independent British overseas military operation since the Falklands war. </p> <p>Thirty-nine years after the union flag was hauled down in Freetown on almost two centuries of bloody colonial rule, British squaddies have now been back in significant force for months, their commanders directing the conduct of a gruesome and intractable civil war. </p> <p>With barely a murmur of public debate at home, British troops are once again shooting Sierra Leoneans dead in their own land, while Royal Navy gunboats patrol the west African coast and the limb-hacking rebels of the Revolutionary United Front are routinely compared to Nazis, the standard designation for all post-1945 British enemies. </p> <p>The scaled-down British \"training mission\" and its backup security units - denounced by the UN commander for their \"Rambo tactics\" - are embroiled in a wider conflict with, among others, renegade British-armed militias. More paratroopers have been shipped out to hold an indefensible line. The declared intent is not only to rescue hostages and maul the erstwhile government-supporting \"West Side Boys\", but also to take back control of Sierra Leone's lucrative diamond fields. </p> <p>The Blair administration's intervention sprees began with the four-day Anglo-American missile onslaught against Iraq in December 1998. The bombing raids there have continued, outside the terms of UN resolutions and opposed by a majority of the permanent UN security council members, while the US and Britain's enforcement of the failed sanctions regime - described by US Democratic congressman David Bonnier as \"infanticide masquerading as a policy\" - is now almost universally recognised as having created a humanitarian disaster. </p> <p>But it was Nato's self-proclaimed war of values over Kosovo that triggered Mr Blair's clarion call last year in Chicago for a new wave of worldwide intervention, based on what he described - echoing the liberal imperialists of the late 19th century - as a \"subtle blend\" of self-interest and moral purpose. </p> <p>A year on, reverse ethnic cleansing proceeds apace in Kosovo. </p> <p>But the full flowering of Mr Blair's new line has been in Africa, where the Unites States still fears to tread in the wake of its Somali debacle of the early 1990s. After weeks of British interference in the internal crisis in Zimbabwe - with British ministers repeatedly championing the cause of white landowners who made up the backbone of the racist Rhodesian regime, while denouncing the black leadership which defeated it as \"uncivilised\" - Blair's paratroopers were despatched to Freetown to fill the vacuum left by the disintegrating UN peacekeeping force Britain refused to join a year ago. </p> <p>The fact that Iraq, Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone are all former British colonies does not seem to trouble the cheerleaders of the new \"doctrine of international community\", enveloped as they are in a blanket of cultural amnesia about the horrors of Britain's colonial past. It is less than 50 years since British soldiers shot dead striking Sierra Leoneans on the streets of Freetown, were paid five shillings for each Kenyan Kikuyu they killed, nailed the limbs of Mau Mau fighters to cross-roads posts and had themselves photographed with the severed heads of Malayan guerrillas. </p> <p>With such a record, it might be thought that Britain was the last country on the planet to sort out the \"savagery\" of its once-captive subjects. The world, we are told, has moved on. But for the people of Africa - burdened with western debt, arms, mercenaries, mineral-hungry multinational companies and commodity prices that have been falling for more than 40 years - it has not moved on enough. </p> <p>After supporting one corrupt dictator after another in Sierra Leone, Britain has thrown its military and diplomatic weight behind President Kabbah and his supporters, who Tony Blair insists are the democratic \"good guys\", against the rural-based RUF, led by vice- president Foday Sankoh until his capture by British soldiers in May. </p> <p>But the 1996 elections which brought Kabbah to power were held when the country was already engulfed in civil war, did not include the RUF and were undermined by violence and ballot rigging claims. While the RUF has the worst record of atrocities, according to Amnesty International, Kabbah and his kamajor militias have also been heavily involved in torture and extra-judicial killings, and his ally Johnny Paul Koroma is responsible for the mutilation and massacre of thousands of civilians. These are the people British troops are supporting - until Koroma's former proteges, the West Side Boys, started kidnapping British soldiers. </p> <p>The reality is that Britain and its friends are part of the problem in Sierra Leone and that no outside force can impose the necessary internal settlement. If Mr Blair wants to build a genuine international community, he should be working through the UN and universally accepted regional bodies - rather than, as Nelson Mandela charged earlier this year, playing \"policemen of the world\" with the US and \"introducing chaos into international affairs\" by acting unilaterally. </p> <p>The record shows that the more effective peacekeepers in Sierra Leone have been regional forces. The most useful contribution Britain and other western states - which still refuse to write off the debts of countries such as Nigeria - could now make to Sierra Leone would be to support an African solution to an African crisis. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:seumas.milne@theguardian.com\">seumas.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The TUC wants to bring its \"social partnership\" up to levels \"common throughout the rest of the EU\" (Morris warns TUC to beware euro danger, September 8). But this requires measures wider than the proposal by the European Commission for rights to information and consultation in enterprises with 50 employees or more. <p>In many European countries, unions have legally protected rights of access to the workforce. In Britain, a right to general access is confined to the period before a ballot in the recognition procedures of the 1999 legislation. </p> <p>Many unions are also able to sue in the courts on behalf of their members' collective interests. In Britain, employees must enforce employment protection rights by individualised claims. </p> <p>In Germany and France, the employer must make a \"social plan\" providing for compensation to workers because of regrading and other changes. The German version must be agreed between the works council and employer, or is imposed by bipartite arbitration if they cannot agree. In France, collective dismissals effected in the absence of a \"social plan\" are null and void, and workers in such cases must be immediately reinstated. Here, even in cases of unfair dismissal reinstatement is a rare remedy. </p> <p>For a modern system of protection of workers, we must still look to national systems of law and collective bargaining. EU rights rarely go beyond rights to consultation. <br><b>Lord Wedderburn </b></p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Trade unionists should consider breaking with New Labour when it comes to the use of their union's political levy. Ordinary members of trade unions have little or no say over how their political levy is used. This issue is even more important when one considers the present government's record on the minimum wage and privatisation and the way in which New Labour now funds itself with donations from big business. <br><b>John Boocock</b> <br> Invergordon</p>",
  "The UN warned Indonesia yesterday that it would be held responsible for the fate of some 130,000 East Timorese refugees in West Timor who are facing deteriorating conditions and a dwindling food supply following last week's evacuation of international humanitarian organisations. <p>With stocks of rice, the refugees' staple, and medicine exhausted in many of the 200-odd camps in West Timor and running dangerously low in the others, UN officials are warning that unless Jakarta changes its policy towards the refugees then thousands could soon die. </p> <p>\"If they do starve then it's because of a decision by the Indonesian government,\" said Andrew Harper, who was the programme coordinator of the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) in West Timor until all staff of international organisations were withdrawn following the murder of three UNHCR staff by pro-Jakarta militiamen on Wednesday. </p> <p>\"Indonesia has a major programme to distribute rice across the archipelago to feed its 200m people and it has the resources to carry out this programme,\" he said. \"So another 130,000 mouths should not be a problem. All it will take is the political will.\" </p> <p>Such political will has been in short supply in Jakarta since the UN staff were killed. After an emergency cabinet meeting on Friday, the vice president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, announced that 100 tonnes of rice would be sent soon to the refugees in West Timor. </p> <p>That is about 6% of the amount the UN has been distributing to the refugees each month through its partner organisations since October. Most of the refugees were forced to leave East Timor by the militias following the territory's overwhelming vote for independence from Indonesia in a UN-sponsored referendum. </p> <p>In the past refugees have said that even when they were given food, much of it was seized by the militiamen who control the camps.</p>",
  "The suicide of a man caught kerb crawling has sparked uproar in Italy over a new police tactic to expose and humiliate prostitutes' clients. <p>A 25-year-old engineer hanged himself from a tree near his parents' house after police impounded his car and charged him with exploiting the prostitute in the passenger seat.</p> <p>He had not broken any law and would not have been convicted. Police knew, however, that the news of his arrest would dominate gossip in his village of Colfesco, near Venice, where he had a girlfriend and family.</p> <p>The interior minister, Enzo Bianco, immediately distanced himself from the policy of naming and shaming and ordered an inquiry into the decision to arrest the man, named only as Antonello.</p> <p>\"I have never given a directive telling police to sequester the cars of clients,\" said Mr Bianco.</p> <p>The issue threatened to split the centre-left government after the prime minister, Giuliano Amato, said zero tolerance was necessary to combat Italy's soaring number of streetwalkers, estimated at 50,000.</p> <p>Prostitution is not a crime in Italy, but aiding and abetting prostitutes is, so several cities have started targeting clients with a law originally aimed at pimps.</p> <p>Police credit the tactic with dramatic reductions in kerb crawling. Lawyers are fighting to have it declared illegitimate and a violation of privacy.</p> <p>The village priest told mourners they had lost a decent young man who made a mistake and paid too high a price.</p> <p>Maurizio, a friend of Antonello, told reporters: \"They killed him. He was humiliated, he was a boy who lived in a village where everyone talks about everyone.\"</p> <p>According to yesterday's Il Messaggero newspaper, the crackdown has resulted in Rome's kerb crawlers swapping cars for bicycles, which are less likely to be confiscated. The women are carried on back carriers.</p> <p>\"They are afraid of the fines,\" said a Nigerian prostitute who had been with three cyclists that day.</p>",
  "After 140 days of \"living hell\", the four westerners released at the weekend by Muslim separatists in the southern Philippines spent their first full day of freedom yesterday enjoying the delights of a luxury resort before preparing to fly home. <p>But the Philippines' worst ever hostage crisis, on the remote, jungle island of Jolo, is still far from over. Leaders of the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas said yesterday there was no timetable for the release of their four remaining hostages following a gun battle between rebel factions on Saturday that left at least three people dead. </p> <p>Those still being held are one Filipino - the only one of the original 21 people kidnapped on April 23 - two of three French journalists who were seized while covering the crisis, 12 evangelical Christian preachers taken when they went into the jungle to pray for the hostages and an American seized two weeks ago. </p> <p>But German Marc Wallert, Frenchman Stephane Loisy, and Finns Risto Vahanen and Seppo Franti, the last of the 10 westerners in the original group to be freed, spent yesterday savouring normal life. </p> <p>Once they had surfaced after a night of celebrating, Mr Loisy went scuba diving, which is what he was preparing to do when kidnapped from the Malaysian resort island of Sipadan on April 23. \"It feels like freedom,\" he said. </p> <p>The others spent most of the day lounging by the pool, reading about themselves in newspapers and toasting their freedom with red wine. </p> <p>\"We have had a lot of time to consider our lives, consider our values,\" Mr Vahanen, who owns an engineering firm, said. \"I think our lives will be changed after this.\" He was keen to get back to work. \"Anything will feel like a vacation after what we have been through.\" </p> <p>Mr Franti said drawing helped him through depression. \"I was very down. I drew and this helped me very much,\" he said. At one stage, he said, he was very close to suicide. </p> <p>Most of the hostages, including those released earlier, said the worst moments of their captivity were when they were twice caught in mortar and gunfire between the guerrillas and Philippine soldiers soon after they were captured. </p> <p>At one time while they had to dive out of the bamboo hut in which they were sheltering when a gun fight erupted. Mr Vahanen said they found the hut roof riddled with bullet holes when they went back to it. </p> <p>Mr Franti recounted that he vomited often from the smell of human waste and rotting food as the crisis dragged on and conditions deteriorated. </p> <p>Even though they said they could never forgive Abu Sayyaf for abducting them, the four blamed the Philippine government for causing the crisis. </p> <p>\"[They] can't neglect remote areas.\" Mr Vahanen said. They have to give similar chances to all people, no matter what their religion, no matter where they live. What we saw in Jolo was real poverty, and this kind of poverty is always the seed of this kind of guerrilla movement.\" </p> <p>As with the six westerners freed two weeks ago, the four men will fly home via Libya so that the Libyans, who paid the $4m (\u00a32.8m) that secured their release, can bask in their success. The Libyan negotiator Rajab Azzarouq insists that the money is for development projects, but it is clear the rebels are using much of it to buy new weapons and to attract recruits. </p> <p>Arguments over the distribution of the cash is believed to have caused the battle on Saturday. The senior Abu Sayyaf commander, Ghalib Andang, said yesterday that he could not release the remaining prisoners until he had dealt with the faction that rebelled against his leadership. </p> <p>A separate faction is holding the American Jeffrey Schilling. Yesterday it released a tape, which it claimed was an interview with him.\"Although I am kept in either chains or handcuffs, I am not mistreated,\" said the tape, broadcast on the Radio Mindanao network. </p> <p>\"Their negotiators are ready to compromise on their part. Use the Libyan government as negotiators and end my captivity as soon as possible.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ever since Smashy and Nicey spelt it out for us, doing \"a lot of work for charidy\" has been universally interpreted as a ruse by the overpaid and over-the-hill to turn around a tarnished public image. </p> <p>So when two well-heeled advertising agencies announce new charity initiatives in the same week, the cynics are bound to go into overdrive. </p> <p>TBWA, wearing its conscience on its sleeve, has created a bold new campaign for the Big Issue. And to pay for the media space, it has arranged a soiree at the Science Museum with guest speakers Mo Mowlam and Big Issue founder John Bird. </p> <p>The agency is inviting around 50 of its bigger clients to the evening and in return will ask them to donate a double-page spread from their own media schedules to the Big Issue's cause. </p> <p>Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, meanwhile, has just launched a big, glossy coffee table book called Social Work - Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's Cause-Related Ideas. They seem to have forgotten the second half of Smashy and Nicey's line: \"I do a lot of work for charidy but I don't like to talk about it\". A 300-page book outlining their good deeds smacks of bragging. </p> <p>But advertising executives are an all too easy target. Ed Jones, who compiled the Saatchi book, says: \"People think we're all sabre-toothed tigers and it's not true. But it wouldn't even matter if it was true - as long as the good causes benefit. The book shows that advertising can be a force for good in the world; it's often presented as an evil activity.\" </p> <p>The good causes represented in the book include Greenpeace, the NSPCC, the Commission for Racial Equality, the Gun Control Network and Partnership for a Drug-Free America. And, despite its self-congratulatory tone, the work on show is some of the most creative, thought-provoking and memorable advertising of the past 30 years. </p> <p>Who can forget the \"pregnant man\" poster or, more recently, the NSPCC \"full stop\" campaign? Whatever the adman's motives, people take notice and the good causes benefit. </p> <p>Barnardo's latest campaign - the one where a baby injects heroin - provoked outrage and brought almost as much media attention to Bartle Bogle Hegarty as it did to the charity. But Barnardo's head of advertising Suzanne Heaney doesn't mind one bit. \"We don't feel used,\" she says, \"because it all works in our favour.\" </p> <p>The cynical people tend to be the young creatives who want to make a name for themselves. They pick on a charity, make a shocking ad on spec and then persuade said charity to run the ad. The next step is for the team to place the ad in some obscure 4am television slot and - hey presto - they win an award. In adland, one decent award can double an already fat salary, and a creative team can make a whole career on the back of it. </p> <p>Saatchi's book contains an ad for that well-known \"good cause,\" Islington council. It shows a man emerging from his front door first thing in the morning, clad only in his pyjamas. He pulls his pants down, squats on the pavement and after much straining, deposits the fruit of his labours right on his own doorstep. A businessman walks past on his way to work and - surprise, surprise - slips on the mess. </p> <p>The line is: \"You wouldn't. Don't let your dog\", and it won awards for the team that created it. There is not so much a social conscience at work here as a childish sense of humour and a hunger for recognition. </p> <p>Charity clients, however, are getting wise to these tactics. Most now employ sophisticated career marketers who want to know that an ad will fit with their brand image before they approve it. Even if an agency is offering its services for free, the client won't just roll over and be grateful. </p> <p>Johnny Hornby of TBWA says that he will only consider the Big Issue campaign a success if the agency succeeds in getting plenty of free media space from its clients. \"I like doing ads that run rather than ads that win awards,\" he says. </p> <p>But let's face it, Johnny Hornby is never going to be homeless. As he's the thirtysomething joint managing director of one of London's top advertising agencies, the size of his pay packet could stand up to comparison with the most affluent of his generation. </p> <p>To be fair, Hornby is not pretending that TBWA has anything more to offer than advertising skills. He is no bleeding heart: \"It's good for agency morale when we all pull together to do something that makes a difference,\" he says. \"They are nice ads. We're just doing what we do anyway. And it's more interesting than toothpaste.\" </p> <p>Lucie Russell, the Big Issue Foundation's chief executive, says: \"Obviously we're good for their corporate CV and they always mention that we're a client in their quarterly reports. If they get press out of the new campaign then it's fine by us. We don't pay them and no one is completely altruistic. But TBWA seems genuinely to want to help us.\" </p> <p>On a recent away day, TBWA's 280 staff were given the opportunity to vote on how to spend the \u00a320,000 that management had put aside for a project to \"make a difference to the agency\". The winning idea was another day away from work, but this time they would spend the day refurbishing a hostel for the homeless. </p> <p>TBWA's clients include NatWest Bank, Rupert Murdoch's News International and Marlboro cigarettes. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi makes ads for Hewlett-Packard, Sony and Toyota. As long as these corporate giants continue to spend millions on advertising, their agencies will be able to find the time and resources to assuage their consciences through service to good causes. </p> <p>But there's no need to feel concern for the big clients who fund the saintly impulses of the advertising community. Russell has more of a problem with these \"corporate monsters\" than she does with advertising agencies. \"We are constantly disappointed by the big companies. They always want to know what's in it for them and where their name will appear,\" she says. </p> <p>The agencies, of course, already know what's in it for them.</p>"
