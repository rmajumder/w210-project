[
  "<p>For a group of sportsmen who traditionally display an arrogance that would make an American 4x100 metres relay team look modest, Germany's finest footballers were a subdued lot yesterday as they were ushered out of a specially constructed exit at Luton Airport to board, what else, a silver Mercedes Benz coach. </p> <p>Their flight from Frankfurt arrived 45 minutes early, which some people interpreted as typical German efficiency. In fact, it was a stroke of good fortune which prevented them scoring yet another own-goal in a week in which they have done little else. </p> <p>The early arrival meant they were able to bring their scheduled training session at Arsenal's London Colney headquarters in Hertfordshire forward by an hour. They had originally arranged to arrive at 6.30pm until informed by a sanguine Arsenal official that, if they stuck to that time, they would be finishing their shooting practice in total darkness. </p> <p>The German players looked less motivated than a squad of Stan Collymores when they left Luton but they lightened up as they kicked a ball around in training. And the coach Rudi V\u00f6ller looked much happier with a real football at his feet rather than the political one he has been trying to control all week following the scandal that has broken over the head of his friend and putative successor Christoph Daum. </p> <p>Daum, the Bayer Leverkusen coach who is facing prosecution over a land deal and has also been engulfed in allegations involving sex and drugs that have led to calls for him to be sacked before he has even started, was a notable absentee from the German camp. </p> <p>He had planned to be at Wembley on Saturday for the game against England but pulled out with the words: \"Unfortunately I cannot make it. I would have loved the chance to say goodbye.\" </p> <p>For a split second it seemed he had decided to withdraw from the job after all, until he made it clear he was saying auf wiedersehen not to his career as national coach but to the old Wembley. For those fans who have had to put up with the appalling conditions under the twin towers, good riddance would have sufficed. </p> <p>Daum was not the only significant absentee last night. Though Carsten Jancker was present, and at 6ft 9in one can hardly miss him, he failed to join his team-mates in training. He is suffering from a toe injury, not surprisingly given the height and weight it has to support, though he is expected to be fit for the weekend. </p> <p>After Jancker's dreadful miss against England in Charleroi during Euro 2000 Kevin Keegan may be praying that he reports A1. This may be particularly true since Jancker himself admits that he and Oliver Bierhoff are so alike as players that they are still trying to formulate a playing plan that does not involve them tripping over each other's feet every other minute. </p> <p>\"We have to talk about it a lot before the game and sort out precisely what each of us is going to do,\" said Jancker. \"We are the same types of players, we make the same sorts of runs and we have to make sure that we are not both standing around in the middle of the box waiting for the same ball.\" </p> <p>More worryingly for the German camp was that Mehmet Scholl, rehabilitated in the side under V\u00f6ller, did not even travel with them. Instead he was transported to Munich to undergo an operation on a troublesome left knee by Hans M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt, guru to Michael Owen, among other English players. </p> <p>Scholl was due to fly in well after lights out last night, though it would be a huge risk to play him against England so soon after surgery. The dilemma for V\u00f6ller is whether he can risk not playing him since Bierhoff is the only fully fit striker at his disposal. </p> <p>If Scholl declares himself fit, Bierhoff may even start on the bench, which is perhaps why he is thinking of resigning from the captaincy. Sounding a bit like Alan Shearer before his retirement speech from international football, Bierhoff said: \"I have showed that I don't have to hide behind anyone\", which is believed to be a reference to his recent scoring performances for Milan in the Champions League and against Vicenza in Italy's Serie A on Sunday. </p> <p>But Bierhoff is adamant that this week of troubles will not affect the dressing-room spirit, saying: \"There is always turbulence in football but it will not affect the way we play. We certainly won't use it as an excuse if we lose.\" </p> <p>Team selection may still be a grey area but the Germans managed to complete training before darkness fell over London Colney. They finished in just over 45 minutes, leaving them no time even to practise penalties - or own-goals. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "There is speculation that Slobodan Milosevic has left Yugoslavia as reports claim that three large planes have left Belgrade's military airport. <p>Serbia is on the brink of revolution, after anti-government demonstrators seized control of the parliament building in Belgrade and set it on fire.</p> <p>But the Yugoslav army has said that it will not intervene to halt the demonstrations, adding to hopes that Mr Milosevic's regime has collapsed.</p> <p>In what could be the endgame for President Slobodan Milosevic, demonstrators said dozens of police at the federal parliament and the state-run TV station had joined crowds taking control of both buildings.</p> <p>State television came back on air at about 8pm London time, apparently under opposition control.</p> <p>There are unconfirmed reports that the Yugolsav army has been in contact with the opposition crisis committee, according to the B92 radio station. </p> <p>Opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica this evening appealed for calm and urged demonstrators to return to work tomorrow, amid signs that he had lost control of the protests against Mr Milosevic\u00d5s continuing rule. There are fears of large-scale bloodshed tonight if Mr Milosevic orders tanks on to the streets, a tactic he used to quell an uprising in March 1991.</p> <p>In what is said to be the biggest uprising in 13 years of Mr Milosevic\u00d5s rule, gunfire has been heard in front of the TV building, with one person reported killed and several wounded. </p> <p>Protesters quickly established control of the parliament building as police fled or surrendered. Demonstrators inside the parliament threw pictures of President Milosevic into the streets.</p> <p>Later, the first main TV programme went off the air, leaving television screens black. The second programme also was interrupted. </p> <p>Before ebbing, clashes spread through the streets of the capital, which echoed with the sound of stun grenades and tear gas fired to break up the crowds. The Beta news agency reported that \"several dozen\" people had been admitted to emergency wards. </p> <p>A bulldozer, commandeered by demonstrators, broke into the TV building, driving over a protester and apparently killing him. Demonstrators poured inside, as police fled out the back. </p> <p>Today\u00d5s protest saw scenes reminiscent of the 1989 revolution in Romania that overthrew Nicolai Ceausescu. It is the most serious unrest in the campaign of civil disobedience that erupted after last month's election, which Mr Kostunica is considered to have won. Mr Milosevic has refused to concede defeat and has threatened to remain in power until the end of his mandate next year.</p> <p>Violence erupted at the start of a huge rally which the opposition called to force Mr Milosevic to accept electoral defeat. Hundreds of thousands had assembled less than an hour before the rally was to begin, and tens of thousands more streamed into the city. </p> <p>Police had already fired tear gas at a group of protesters who tried to push their way into the domed building earlier in the afternoon. </p> <p>\"At this moment, terror rules in Belgrade,\" the pro-Milosevic government television said in a commentary. \"They are attacking everyone they see on the streets and there is chaos.\" </p> <p>Tensions rose after the Yugoslav constitutional court issued a ruling which one judge reportedly said nullified the September ballot. </p> <p> Elsewhere in Serbia, thousands more joined smaller rallies in towns throughout the country. In the third largest city, Nis, about 10,000 people tried to push their way into the local office of Mr Milosevic's party but were persuaded by opposition leaders not to give police a reason to attack them. </p> <p> By early afternoon, central Belgrade was packed, with many people streaming toward the parliament building and blocking traffic as they did so. Many wore paper caps with the slogan, \"We'll Endure.\" They moved past shops, some shut down with signs stating, \"Closed because of robbery\" - an allusion to opposition claims that Mr Milosevic stole the elections. </p> <p> In what the opposition hoped was a further sign the regime was crumbling, more than 160 employees of Serbian state television - a major pillar of Mr Milosevic's power - were sacked after going on strike. Most were technicians and staff of non-political programmes. Most Milosevic loyalists remained, and kept the network on the air. </p>",
  "William Hague used his closing speech to the Conservative party conference to set out an agenda for government which he believes will appeal to \"the common sense of a proud people who believe in Britain\". <p>Deriding New Labour as a \"fashion\" whose time had passed, he combined a commitment to improve the quality of public services, particularly in inner cities, with a tough line on issues such as crime, taxation and Europe.</p> <p>\"This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we are ready to be a government,\" he said, claiming that his party's conference had proved this \"beyond doubt\".</p> <p>He challenged Tony Blair to call the election immediately, and derided the government in a string of effective jokes.</p> <p>\"Last week in Brighton the security was so tight it was Wednesday before they stabbed each other in the back,\" he said, describing the government as \"divided, arrogant and out of touch\".</p> <p>Nowhere was this more apparent, he said, than with the Dome.</p> <p>\"There it is, the Dome: the first paragraph of their manifesto and the last word about their Government,\" he said.</p> <p>The word which dominated was \"people\", an effort to contrast the Tories' grasp of popular concern over issues such as petrol tax with the government's refusal to compromise with protesters.</p> <p>\"For all the people who think that the law should be on the side of the house-owner and not the house-breaker - I'm in it for you,\" Hague said.</p> <p>\"For all the people who want to keep the pound - I'm in it for you.\"</p> <p>Throughout the Tory leader sought to appeal to what he called the \"mainstream\".</p> <p>\"The people I grew up with and millions like them are the mainstream of this country. They are the people who motivate me,\" he said.</p> <p>There was only a brief mention of \"tolerance, mutual respect and the rich diversity of this country\" - in contrast to Michael Portillo's address earlier in the week. That speech is believed to have led to a row between the shadow chancellor and the party leader.</p> <p>Arguing that \"wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy\", Hague laid out his position on taxation, certain to be one of the key battlegrounds at the election.</p> <p>He was less specific, however, on how this policy will be financed. The speech has left Mr Hague's Achilles heel unprotected.</p>",
  "Protesters have clashed with soldiers in the Gaza Strip and West Bank today after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat struggled to find a way to stem the violence. <p>One Palestinian died and nine were wounded in the clashes which shattered an informal ceasefire agreed after talks between the two leaders in Paris yesterday.</p> <p>Shooting broke out at Netzarim Junction in the central Gaza Strip, site of repeated clashes in recent days. It was here that 12-year-old Mohammed al-Durrah died in his father's embrace after fighting first erupted last week, a death recorded in shocking detail by a television cameraman. Today Israeli troops came under attack and returned fire. </p> <p>Violence also broke out after a funeral in the West Bank city of Hebron. Stone-throwing Palestinians battled with Israeli troops on one of the main streets, and three Palestinians were wounded by rubber-coated steel bullets, witnesses said. </p> <p>Those two clashes were the worst outbursts on a day that had been less turbulent than any other since the fighting began a week ago. In that time, 66 people have been killed and 1,800 injured, most of them Palestinian. </p> <p>After the Paris talks yesterday, the Palestinians pledged to rein in rioting and Israel withdrew tanks from flashpoints at the Netzarim junction in northern Gaza, Joseph's Tomb in Nablus on the West Bank and the Circle area of Ramallah, also on the West Bank. An Israeli military official said the army was taking steps to avoid confrontations.</p> <p>\"The guiding principle is to see but not be seen,\" said Colonel Yossi Adiri, commander of Israeli forces near the Palestinian-ruled West Bank city of Nablus, after meeting his Palestinian counterpart. </p> <p>\"We understand that a visible force causes agitation, which we do not want. At the same time, these forces will be prepared for any development in the field.\" </p> <p>Hopes of a lasting ceasefire had been raised when the United States helped set up a trilateral committee to facilitate the process of security cooperation. But Mr Arafat refused to initial a proposed agreement and travelled on to Egypt, while Mr Barak returned to Israel. </p> <p>\"In Paris we continued to turn over every stone on the way to peace and to try to stop the violence,\" Mr Barak said. \"I am not convinced that at this moment we have a partner for peace. But it is our obligation ... to pursue this to the end.\" </p> <p>In Cairo today US scretary of state Madeleine Albright held talks with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and Mr Arafat. </p> <p>Mrs Albright said that \"remarkable progress\" had been made in Paris and that both sides would follow through on security arrangements agreed there.</p> <p>The most contentious issue during the Paris talks was that of an inquiry into the causes of the fighting. Mr Arafat wanted an international inquiry with UN involvement, while Mr Barak preferred a joint Palestinian-Israeli investigation. At one point Mr Arafat stormed out - only to be stopped when Mrs Albright called guards to shut the residence's gates to block him.</p> <p>Nabil Shaath, an Arafat aide, said the Palestinian leader was angered by the Israeli refusal to set up an international inquiry into Palestinian claims that the Israelis have used excessive force. </p> <p>But the talks were described as productive, with US officials crediting both leaders with a sincere effort to restore the trust essential for peacemaking to proceed. </p> <p>US officials briefing reporters on Mrs Albright's plane said, for instance, that Mr Barak had agreed that Israeli forces would fire live ammunition only when their lives were threatened.</p> <p>The fighting was triggered by last Thursday's visit by rightwing Israeli politician Ariel Sharon to Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque compound - a site claimed as holy by both Jews and Muslims.</p>",
  "<b>What's the latest from Belgrade?</b> <br> Crowds of angry demonstrators have swarmed into the parliament building as well as the state-run TV station. Many police are reported to have joined the demonstrations, and gunfire has been reported. Columns of protesters are streaming into the Yugoslav capital to attend the rally which the opposition hopes will be the final push in the campaign to dethrone Milosevic. <p><b>How has the regime responded? </b><br> It is furiously rattling its formidable sabres, claiming that the strikes and protests are the work of \"foreign agencies\" The Ministry of Information in Belgrade says it will \"take legal actions against those who endanger lives, freedom and rights of other citizens\". </p> <p><b>What exactly is the protest about? </b><br> The opposition says its main candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, won last week's presidential elections outright - a view shared by the pitiful number of independent observers allowed to observe the poll. The Milosevic regime admits that Kostunica won - but insist that he failed to gain the 50% needed to avoid a second round of voting. </p> <p><b>So there will be a run-off? </b><br> No, says the opposition. Their man won, fair and square, and Milosevic must go. No, says the ruling clique, which has decided that the elections were invalid anyway. That, at least, is the verdict of a regime-controlled court which has annulled the results and implied that the whole process must be repeated. </p> <p><b>Where on earth does that leave us? </b><br> Anyone's guess. The situation is changing by the hour, with conflicting reports from Belgrade about the unity of the opposition, the strength of the regime and, crucially, the loyalty of the police and armed forces. </p> <p><b>Have there been any violent confrontations? </b><br> So far, apart from some pushing and shoving, the protests have been free of bloodshed. Demonstrators have shown, however, that they are not cowed by the security forces. At the Kolubara mining centre, riot police were simply shouldered aside by protestors supporting the striking miners. Elsewhere, police stood aside from protests, apparently unwilling to be drawn into confrontation. </p> <p><b>Are the strikes having an effect? </b> <br> There have been widespread power cuts in Serbia as power stations run out of coal. Many more state workers, including telecoms staff and bus drivers, have said they will strike today in defiance of the regime. </p> <p><b>Does the regime still control the local media? </b> <br> Intriguingly, its grip appears to be slipping. Several television stations, part of the rigorously state-controlled national network, have begun broadcasting independent news reports, including claims of of electoral fraud by Milosevic. Previously servile state-owned newspapers have also started to show some objectivity by reporting the opposition protests. </p> <p><b>Useful links: </b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/serbia\">Special report: Serbia</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/yugo/\">Special report: Yugoslav war crimes</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.serbia-info.com/news/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Serb Ministry of Information</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.izbori2000.net/index.php?language=english\" target=\"_new\"> Free Serbia (opposition group) </a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.iwpr.net/index.pl5?home_index.html\" target=\"_new\"> Institute for War and Peace Reporting</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.melty.com/words/writings/yugo.html\" target=\"_new\">A personal history of Yugoslavia</a></p>",
  "<p>This report is based on work carried out by a team of experts at the GHI, the most authoritative product testing centre in the country. They made an exhaustive scientific assessment of 26 vacuum cleaners currently on the UK market. They looked at dirt pick-up performance by cleaning carpets and hard flooring covered with measured amounts of a sand and flour mixture that simulated dirt and dust. Kapok, a soft fibre, was used for pet hair. The score out of 10 is based on dirt pick-up, ease of use and the results of the filtration efficiency test, carried out by an independent specialist laboratory. </p> <p>So the GHI's top eight vacuum cleaners - in a choice of three price bands - is as follows: </p> <p><strong> UNDER \u00a3100 </strong></p> <p><strong>Bosch Sphera 22</strong> \u00a389.99.

Here are the five most often asked about vacuum cleaners: </p> <p> <strong> 1. Which is better, upright or a cylinder? </strong> </p> <p> An upright cleaner is generally better for cut-pile carpets because a rotating brush (beater bar) in its cleaning head not only beats and sucks out the dirt but also lifts the carpet pile. However, some cylinder cleaners have a turbo brush attachment that does the same job. For natural fibre flooring, hard floors and loop-pile carpet, you are better off with a cylinder cleaner, which relies on suction alone to pick up dirt. If you prefer using an upright, look for one with the option to turn off the beater bar, or with an automatically adjustable cleaning head. </p> <p> <strong> 2 What type would be a good choice for asthma sufferers?</strong> </p> <p> Look for a vacuum cleaner that has a filter efficiency of at least 95%. This refers to the proportion of tiny dust particles that are retained in the bag or canister. It is not a measure of how efficiently it picks up dirt. </p> <p> <strong> 3 How important is wattage?</strong> </p> <p> A common misconception is that vacuum cleaners with the highest power ratings (watts) work best. Wattage relates to how much electricity is used rather than the amount of dirt sucked up. Until all manufacturers test to the same performance standards, you'll have to take our word for it. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Pet hairs are a constant problem in our house, so what should I look for?</strong> </p> <p> A cleaner with a beater bar or turbo brush will help lift pet hairs, but avoid using it on loop-pile or natural floor coverings as the beating action could damage the surface. </p> <p> <strong> 5 What about stairs?</strong> </p> <p> Cylinder cleaners are generally lighter and more compact and so easier to carry around. Look for one that is small enough or specially designed to balance well on steps or has a long flexible hose.</p>",
  "This has been the best, the most upbeat and the most successful Conservative Conference in years. <p> This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we are ready to be a Government. </p> <p> And with the policies we have presented and the purpose we have demonstrated, we have shown beyond doubt that we are ready for Government. </p> <p> This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we have the right team to run the country. </p> <p> And with brilliant platform speeches we have shown beyond doubt that this Shadow Cabinet, with its breadth of vision and its depth of talent, is the best team for Britain. </p> <p> The breadth of vision to help hard working families; and depth of talent too. Didn't Michael Portillo make a fantastic speech and show what a brilliant Chancellor of the Exchequer he'll be?</p> <p> The breadth of vision to preserve our independence in a flexible Europe; and the depth of talent. After years of Robin Cook wouldn't it be great to have a real Foreign Secretary like Francis Maude?</p> <p> The breadth of vision to rejuvenate our inner cities, set our schools free, help our pensioners and improve the NHS; and the depth of talent with people like Michael Ancram, Archie Norman, Theresa May, David Willetts and Dr Liam Fox ready to take up the challenge of government.</p> <p> The breadth of vision to win the war against crime; and the depth of talent that would give us a great crime-fighting Home Secretary in Ann Widdecombe. </p> <p> Our Conference has looked like a Conference for the future. Labour's looked like a Conference from the past. </p> <p> After all the years of trying to control the trade unions, it was back to beer and sandwiches in Brighton last week. Tony Blair likes beer and sandwiches without the beer. I like it without the sandwiches. Come to think of it, I like it without the unions.</p> <p> And throughout this week, we have shown the British people beyond doubt that we can win the next general election.</p> <p> Thanks to the Deputy Prime Minister we now know when that election is planned to be. Last week that political titan was asked a trick question: has Labour's disastrous performance changed your plans for an election in six month's time? John Prescott innocently replied: 'no it hasn't'.</p> <p> But even without John Prescott helping us out, we're ready for that election whenever Tony Blair now dares to call it. We're ready for it next autumn, we're ready for it next May, we're ready for it now. Go on Tony, call it now.</p> <p> We all remember the armchair critics who told us after the last election that we could not recover. Don't even bother they said, for we have entered a new world in which Tony Blair can do no wrong and New Labour will rule forever.</p> <p> But New Labour was not a philosophy, it was a fashion. And nothing is more unfashionable than a fashion that's out of fashion.</p> <p> We saw them last week, divided, arrogant and out of touch. What a bunch they are - this soap opera of a government.</p> <p> In last week's episode of the Neighbours from Hell: Robin has fallen out with Peter. Peter won't talk to Geoffrey any more. Geoffrey won't lend his holiday home to Tony. Mo has been sent to Coventry. Clare doesn't like the tent run by Tony's crony. Tony's crony blames Chris and Peter. Tony rows with Gordon. Peter won't speak to Gordon. And Gordon won't speak to anyone at all.</p> <p> Last week in Brighton the security was so tight it was Wednesday before they stabbed each other in the back.</p> <p> No Ministers in recent times have lost touch so rapidly with the people who elected them.</p> <p> When an angry pensioner sent a cheque for 75p to Gordon Brown, he cashed it.</p> <p> When Baroness Jay was asked if she understood the desperate crisis in farming, she said she knew all about it because she \"had a little cottage in the country\".</p> <p> Cocooned in Whitehall they have retreated into a world where they never have to make do with a failing school, or witness a crime, or pay for a tank of petrol.</p> <p> It is fundamental to their decline that they have betrayed and forgotten the real people of this country. And it is fundamental to our recovery that we have become the champions of the common sense instincts of the people of our country.</p> <p> And it is you, the people of this country, who do wait for hospital treatment, and do see crime on your street, and do pay for your tank of petrol, that I have in my mind as we fight the next election - It's you that I'm in it for.</p> <p> For all the people who can't afford to pay more in tax to a Government that squanders their money - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who want classrooms where teachers can apply reasonable discipline to children without fear of ending up in court - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who despair at the neglect and poverty and waste of human talent in our inner cities and want to do something about it - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who think it's a scandal when a patient's throat cancer operation is cancelled four times because of political targets - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who think that the law should be on the side of the house-owner and not the house-breaker - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who can see that our asylum system is in chaos and want political leaders with the courage to get up and say so - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who believe that we shouldn't be handing over more of the rights and powers of this country - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who want to keep the Pound - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who are sick of the spin and the waste and the lies and the cronies and the sycophants, sick of the arrogance and the high-handedness, sick of the contempt for our traditions and for our Parliament, sick of a Chancellor too out of touch to listen and of a Prime Minister too arrogant to apologise, for all those people - we are all in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who really hoped that they had elected a Government that would deliver on its promises and have been so bitterly disappointed - we are in it for you.</p> <p> These are people who look to us to give them back their country. And we will not let them down.</p> <p> When Tony Blair declared war on the forces of Conservatism, he declared war on all these people.</p> <p> Last year, in his Conference speech, he said defeating the forces of Conservatism was his great mission for the twenty first century. Last week, nine months into the twenty first century, he didn't mention the forces of Conservatism at all.</p> <p> We really do have a Prime Minister who is prepared to say whatever will please his audience without the slightest consistent thought or principle entering his head.</p> <p> But just because he's stopped talking about the forces of Conservatism, it hasn't made us go away. Just because he's paranoid about the forces of Conservatism doesn't mean we're not out to get him.</p> <p> Because what will bring this Government down is its arrogant contempt for the views of real people.</p> <p> You know the precise moment when everyone started to see through New Labour? Midnight. December 31st last year. You probably all had a good time on New Year's Eve. Ffion and I, we went to the Dome.</p> <p> What did Tony Blair tell us about the Dome? 'I'm absolutely sure that this is going to be a startling and exhilarating success \u0085 it will be the most famous new building in the world in the year 2000'. Well he wasn't wrong about that. </p> <p> And then there was John Prescott: 'if we can't make the Dome work, we're not much of a Government'. Whatever would we do without him?</p> <p> Tony Blair told us that the Dome would be 'the first paragraph of Labour's next Election Manifesto'. What a good idea. </p> <p> In fact such a good idea that I thought I'd help him out by drafting it for him: 'Our New Labour Government, by wasting vast sums of money on something shiny and glitzy on the outside, empty and meaningless on the inside, with no understanding of our history, no vision of our future, and with so much hype followed by complete and utter failure, have successfully built the perfect monument to the way we have governed Britain for the last four years'.</p> <p> There it is, the Dome: the first paragraph of their Manifesto and the last word about their Government.</p> <p> For the real lesson is even more serious than the failure of the Dome. It is that the Prime Minister who now admits that Governments can't run visitor attractions still thinks that Governments know best how to interfere in every classroom, manage every hospital ward, regulate every business and spend everyone's money. </p> <p> You've seen how New Labour said the Dome was going to be a success, and poured your money into it, put their cronies in charge, denied there was a problem, and how at the end it was the people of this country who had to pick up the bill. </p> <p> That is New Labour. That's what they're doing to our schools. That's what they're doing to our hospitals. That's what they're doing to our police force. </p> <p> With the Dome it's taken nine months to see that these interfering busy bodies didn't know what they were doing. Don't give them five more years to prove that they don't know what they're doing with our schools and our hospitals and our police.</p> <p> Peter Mandelson said recently: something's gone seriously wrong with this Labour Government, but what is it? </p> <p> Shall we tell him?</p> <p> Tax is rising faster than anywhere in the developed world. Hospital waiting lists are up 87,000. Secondary school class sizes are bigger. Welfare bills are soaring. Crime is rising after years of falling. The transport system is at a standstill. Petrol taxes are the highest in Europe. Red tape is prolific. Waste is endemic. The bureaucracy is bloated. Political correctness is rampant. The countryside is in crisis. The cities are neglected. Our independence as a nation is being given away and the Prime Minister is spending millions of pounds trying to con us all into abolishing the Pound when we all want to keep it. </p> <p> That's what's wrong with this Government.</p> <p> Three years ago at this Conference I made a prediction. I said: 'New Labour have certainly changed politics for the time being. Their politics without conscience brought fascination to begin with. Then admiration. But next it will bring disillusion. Finally it will bring contempt'. </p> <p> We remember the fascination. We endured the admiration. We have seen the disillusion and now, like millions of our fellow citizens, we feel the contempt. </p> <p> In his speech last week, Tony Blair announced again: 'I will act'. Well, of course he will. It's all been an act. It's only ever been an act. He's the biggest actor in town.</p> <p> But no amount of acting can save him from the truth spelt out in one of those famous Downing Street memos: 'TB' - a clever disguise - 'is not believed to be real. He lacks conviction, he is all spin and presentation, he just says things to please people, not because he believes them.'</p> <p> TB spent thousands of pounds getting that advice. WH could have told him it for nothing.</p> <p> The only person in the country still stuck in the fascination stage with New Labour is the Leader of the Liberals. But of course we've witnessed the four stages of the Liberal Party too. Irrelevance, irrelevance, irrelevance, and irrelevance.</p> <p> So people now look to us. They've seen through the Labour Party and its Leader. Millions are coming to know that not only has Labour failed to deliver, but that they are never going to deliver.</p> <p> This week, and in the coming weeks, people want to know what the alternative will be. They look to us. They want to know if we're ready. They want to know what drives us, what motivates us, what we would be like in office. They want to know where we come from and where we're going to.</p> <p> And they want to know what motivates me.</p> <p> Come with me to the Rother Valley, to the heart of South Yorkshire. See Rotherham, the industrial town I was born in. Visit Wath Comprehensive, the school that gave me a chance in life. </p> <p> Come and meet the people I grew up with. Children of proud mothers who struggled with small budgets, who relied on the local health service, and who hoped for a better life for their sons and their daughters. Children of fathers who worked hard in mines and on farms and in steel works, who never knew the security of owning a home or saving for a pension, who had no choice but to live from one week's pay packet to the next. </p> <p> Those children I grew up with have families of their own now. Many are better off than their parents. They own their own home and they're saving for a pension. Their jobs are in supermarkets, in high street banks, in telephone call centres; they're nurses and teachers and self-employed builders. And the girls in my class are now juggling with all the competing pressures of being good mothers and holding down a good job.</p> <p> But these people, the children I grew up with in South Yorkshire, want the same things as their parents did. They want security and stability for themselves and their families. They want a better life for their own children. </p> <p> Don't think that because they holiday in Tenerife and not Tuscany that they don't have aspirations for a better life.</p> <p> Don't think that because they've moved to Ilkley and not Islington that their voice can be ignored.</p> <p> The people I grew up with, and millions like them, are the mainstream of our country. They are the people who motivate me. </p> <p> And I know that they have almost given up on any politician from any political party standing up for them. </p> <p> For they see their modest incomes eaten away by more taxes every time they fill up their car or tear open their pay slip, and they wonder if any politician knows what its like to raise three children on a family budget that just won't stretch any further. </p> <p> They see young thugs walking free from our courts, and they wonder if any politician knows what it's like to live on a council estate where the criminals take control after dark. </p> <p> They see the independence of the country they love cast aside, and they wonder if any politician shares their patriotism and their pride in being British.</p> <p> These people, the people I grew up with, the mainstream people of this country, are the people who motivate me. </p> <p> And these are the people we will govern for. We will govern for hard working families. We will govern for people of every community and background. We will govern for the mainstream that New Labour has ignored. We will govern for all the people. </p> <p> For when New Labour say to us that we're only appealing to core Conservative voters when we talk about crime and asylum and tax and Europe, I say to them that they have completely lost touch with the hard working families of this country.</p> <p> I say to hard-working families everywhere: I know that you are looking at our Party and judging whether we are ready for government.</p> <p> You know that we are tough on crime, and I tell you this: no government in recent times has been as tough on criminals as we will be.</p> <p> You know that we want to reduce taxes, and no government in recent times has been as committed to cutting taxes as we will be.</p> <p> You know that we believe in Britain, and no party will stand up for the rights and independence of our country with as much resolve and fortitude as we will.</p> <p> You know all this, but I want you to hear something else you may not know.</p> <p> The Conservative Party in Government will direct its energies to improving the schools that are the most hopeless, to bringing life to inner city areas that are the most bleak, to helping pensioners that are the least well off, to tackling drug problems that scar the least fortunate, to addressing family break down in the most dislocated communities, and to improving the health care for those most dependent on the NHS.</p> <p> And it is because we are ready to do all these things that the message coming loud and clear from this Conference is that we are ready for government.</p> <p> There are some who say there is a contradiction between traditional Conservative issues and winning new Tory audiences; between tolerance and mutual respect for all people, and championing the mainstream values of the country.</p> <p> There is no contradiction. I say being tough on crime, believing in lower taxes and the robust defence of our nation's independence are not in contradiction with wanting better schools and hospitals and thriving inner cities; they are an essential part of achieving all those things. I say defeating political correctness and refusing simply to accept every demand from every pressure group is not in contradiction with respecting the differences between individuals; on the contrary, the championing of mainstream values is the championing of tolerance, mutual respect and the rich diversity of our country. </p> <p> Only by trusting the instincts and the individuals and the institutions and the independence of the people of this country can we hope to seize the opportunity that this Government is so tragically squandering.</p> <p> That's why we're going to lead a Common Sense Revolution.</p> <p> That's why we're going to govern for the hard working, hard pressed, decent law abiding people of this country and bring an end to the rule of the small out-of-touch New Labour clique that thinks it is so much better than the rest of us.</p> <p> We're going to govern for the families who've earned every penny they've got and need every penny they earn and want a Government that will cut taxes.</p> <p> Three weeks ago we experienced something in this country we hadn't seen for more than 20 years. The pumps ran out of petrol, the shops ran out of bread, and the country came to a standstill. Labour governments, don't you just love 'em?</p> <p> Tony Blair and his Government say we mustn't give in to pickets. </p> <p> What a nice little lecture from the same Labour politicians who led the seamans' strike and encouraged the miner's strike and supported the secondary pickets.</p> <p> If he'd really been listening, he'd never have introduced his stealth taxes and he'd never have had blockades and he'd never have had the vast majority of the people of this country join in a taxpayers' revolt. </p> <p> Well if they don't understand the taxpayers revolt, we do. If he's not in sympathy with it, we are. And if he won't cut taxes, we will. </p> <p> This Government has contempt for those who want low taxes. They think that wanting lower taxes is selfish and greedy.</p> <p> Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The truck driver who told me how he had to work day and night and sleep in his cab just to feed a family he scarcely got to see wasn't being greedy.</p> <p> He was just desperate and angry to see that hard earned money he'd scraped together disappear in stealth taxes. </p> <p> And I tell him now that the Conservative Party understands the life he's living and we see his desperation and we share his anger and we will govern for him.</p> <p> Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The young software consultant that I met who shook his head as he talked of his plans to move abroad because of the stealth taxes he now faces wasn't being greedy.</p> <p> He just can't understand how this country can ever succeed if he's being taxed out of work in an era when business can go anywhere in the world and we need innovators so badly.</p> <p> And I tell him now that the Conservative Party can see the damage being done to the economic future of our country and we see our talent going abroad and we share his belief that our country cannot afford it and we will govern for him.</p> <p> Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The countless hard working families whom I meet everywhere I go who talk of how difficult they find it to save money and keep their families together and live on just one income while bringing up children aren't being greedy. </p> <p> They just feel betrayed by a Government that promised no tax increases at all.</p> <p> And I tell them now that the Conservative Party understands their sense of betrayal and we know how difficult high taxes have made their lives and we are on their side - and we will govern for them. </p> <p> All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We're going to cut fuel tax. Three pence off a litre of petrol. Three pence off a litre of diesel.</p> <p> We're going to restore a married couples allowance - because I believe marriage is the bedrock of a secure and stable society.</p> <p> We're going to bring an end to the era of stealth taxes and start cutting the taxes paid by hard pressed families.</p> <p> And we know how we're going to pay for it too.</p> <p> We're going to make sure billions of pounds in surplus taxes raised by Gordon Brown goes back to taxpayers who earned it.</p> <p> We're going to reform the welfare system so that we stop losing billions of pounds in fraud and so that those who can work must work.</p> <p> We're going to stop wasting money on worthless Government schemes that are only designed to win headlines for Tony Blair.</p> <p> We're going to reduce the number of Ministers, cut the size of the House of Commons, halve the number of political advisers and cut the whole size of Whitehall so that there aren't so many politicians going around dreaming up expensive meddling schemes to interfere in everybody else's lives.</p> <p> Tony Blair may think his made-up numbers about Tory cuts will win him back a few votes. He couldn't be more wrong. People don't believe the phoney statistics and falsehoods he tells about his own policies and so they certainly won't believe the phoney statistics and falsehoods he tells about ours.</p> <p> The British people know we can have lower taxes and better public services if we spend wisely. They know it can be done.</p> <p> And we're going to do it.</p> <p> For we're ready to govern for all the people. </p> <p> We're going to govern for the parents who want their children to get the best chance in life, who want a Government that will deliver on education.</p> <p> Last week I visited the largest comprehensive school in Birmingham. And the reporters said to me - \"There's a grammar school nearby, why didn't you visit that?\"</p> <p> And I said \"I've visited grammar schools and they do a superb job. But our task now is to raise standards for that vast majority of parents and pupils who haven't got a grammar school to choose from.\"</p> <p> So I've been going to the inner city schools and talking to the pupils and the parents and the teachers.</p> <p> I've been hearing the pupils talk about their hopes and their dreams and how determined they are to better themselves:</p> <p> parents talk of how they want the right to choose the best schools for their children but feel that choice is denied to them;</p> <p> teachers talk of how frustrated they are to spend so much time filling in forms and how difficult they find it keeping discipline when the Government tries to stop them excluding troublemakers;</p> <p> head-teachers talk of the money that gets wasted on bureaucracy when it could be spent improving our schools.</p> <p> It's time someone listened to these people. The Conservative Party is listening to these people and I am determined that we will govern for them.</p> <p> All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We're going to take the money that's spent by politicians and bureaucrats and let the schools spend it instead. \u00a3540 for every pupil.</p> <p> We're going to endow our universities and set them free to be the best in the world.</p> <p> We're going to create Free Schools that can determine their own ethos and decide their own admissions policy and set their own pay policy. </p> <p> We're going to have tougher discipline in our schools because we're going to end the ridiculous situation where schools are penalised by the Government when they exclude pupils and are forced by politicians to take back those who disrupt classrooms. This is a policy that undermines discipline and makes teachers lives impossible and it's going to stop.</p> <p> The British people know these things can be done.</p> <p> And we're going to do them.</p> <p> For we're ready to govern for all the people.</p> <p> We're going to govern for the people who rely on the state pension and the National Health Service and think everyone should share in the growing prosperity of our country.</p> <p> The Government seems confused at why pensioners are angry. But the reason is simple.</p> <p> Pensioners don't like being treated with contempt by people like the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party who said they were all \"racists\".</p> <p> They don't like being talked down to by people like Peter Mandelson who said that they're not worth bothering with because they're not 'aspirational'. </p> <p> I reject this language. Our pensioners should be treated with dignity and respect.</p> <p> And they don't like being treated as charity cases by a Chancellor of the Exchequer who prefers to go on handing out means tested benefits and one off gimmicks because he thinks he knows best.</p> <p> Labour has not governed for them. We will govern for them.</p> <p> All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We're going to take Gordon Brown's gimmicks and the administrative costs wasted on them and put that money back into the basic state pension. \u00a35.50 more a week for every pensioner; \u00a310 for an older pensioner couple.</p> <p> We're going to match Labour penny for penny on the NHS and sweep away Labour's dogmatic opposition to private provision.</p> <p> We're going to make sure every penny is spent on clinical priorities rather than the political priorities of Labour politicians.</p> <p> We're going to give every young person in the country the chance to have a pension of their own far greater than the current state pension.</p> <p> The British people know these things can be done.</p> <p> And we're going to do them.</p> <p> For we're ready to govern for all the people.</p> <p> We're going to govern for the law abiding people of this country who have sometimes felt there wasn't a politician left prepared to champion their common sense values and instincts.</p> <p> It's time we halted the march of political correctness. </p> <p> Can you believe that Birmingham's Labour Council decided to rename Christmas 'the Winterval'?</p> <p> Can you believe that Education Ministers supported a ban on musical chairs because they think the game encourages aggression?</p> <p> Can you believe that they used Number 10 Downing Street to hold a summit on how many thin and fat people should appear on television?</p> <p> I want all these people who despair of this politically correct idiocy to know that we're going to govern for them.</p> <p> I want all the parents who think schools should respect their values and don't want Section 28 abolished to know that we're going to govern for them.</p> <p> I want all the people who are angry at the way our asylum system is in chaos and just want enforcement of the rules - I want them to know that we're going to govern for them. </p> <p> But nothing angers or frustrates the law abiding people of this country more than the failure of this Government to get a grip on rising crime.</p> <p> Like the group of black teenagers I met in a Lambeth comprehensive four months ago. We got around a table in their classroom, and do you know what they said to me? 'The police have got their hands tied and they've lost it. Crime is rising and we're most likely to be the victims'.</p> <p> These people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We're going to restore Labour's cuts in our police force. </p> <p> And we're going to stop tying their hands with red tape and politically correct nonsense. We're going to have less PC and more PCs.</p> <p> We're going to have no more of Labour's early release schemes for rapists and burglars and muggers.</p> <p> We're going to overhaul the law to make sure that it is on the side of the people defending their homes instead of the criminals breaking into those homes. </p> <p> We're going to step up the war against drugs, not surrender to the drug dealers. </p> <p> We're going to make sure that prisoners don't idle around in their cells but do a full working day.</p> <p> We are going to give full force to the common sense instincts of the British people and we're going to win the war against crime. </p> <p> The British people know these things can be done.</p> <p> And we're going to do it.</p> <p> For we're ready to govern for all the people.</p> <p> And we're ready to govern for all parts of the country.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/tories2000/story/0,7369,377944,00.html\">Click here to read remainder of speech</a></p>",
  "Earlier this year, I went to inner city housing estates in London and the north of England <p> I saw there how too many of their schools are failing, there aren't enough jobs available, the shops have gone, and the sprawling tower blocks are rabbit warrens for crime. It's the same story in many of our cities.</p> <p> The people who live on these council estates have never looked to the Conservative Party for support, but I believe passionately that we still have a duty to help them.</p> <p> We are going to reclaim their streets from the drug dealers and car thieves.</p> <p> We are going to bulldoze the worst of the concrete tower blocks and ensure that there are new low rise homes where the criminals won't be welcome.</p> <p> And by bringing life back to our inner cities, we will ease the relentless pressure of the developers on our countryside.</p> <p> Only the most out of touch, metropolitan elite could regard the attack on our rural life and the desperate plight of our farmers as a source of amusement. Yet, in speech after speech, and joke after joke in Brighton last week, New Labour poked fun at the anger and hardship of the people of the countryside.</p> <p> This Government thinks it is attacking only a small rural minority. In fact it is attacking the values of tolerance and respect, the values of the mainstream majority.</p> <p> Rural people look to the Conservative Party to represent them and stand up for their way of life - and we will not let them down. </p> <p> For we are ready to govern for all parts of the country - and by country I mean the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. </p> <p> But a Conservative Government will only be able to do all of these things, and govern for all the people, if we still have a country left to govern at all.</p> <p> For this Labour Government is taking us down the road to a European superstate.</p> <p> Britain is uniquely placed to take advantage of the opportunities of the twenty-first century. </p> <p> We have a unique relationship with the United States, a unique relationship with Europe and a unique relationship with the Commonwealth. </p> <p> Our language is the global language of the new economy.</p> <p> It seems to me to be blindingly obvious and basic common sense that with so many opportunities opening before us, we should not hesitate to make the most of being British. </p> <p> And the advantages of independence seem to have been blindingly obvious to the Danes too. </p> <p> The result of the Danish referendum last week has once and for all demolished Labour's bogus arguments and scare tactics. </p> <p> In a Europe where so many decisions are taken by bureaucratic elites, we should be celebrating the fact that at least in one country the people have spoken. </p> <p> It now gives us a renewed opportunity to press the case for a different kind of Europe.</p> <p> Now we must champion the cause of a flexible, free trading, low tax, lightly regulated Europe. A Europe that goes with the grain of the new global economy, in which nations combine in different combinations for different purposes to different extents.</p> <p> We will be the champions of that flexible Europe. And we will be the champions of Britain's right to govern itself. For we believe in being in Europe not run by Europe.</p> <p> So we will write into the law of our land the powers and rights that we hold today and which we will pass to the next generation, so that no stroke of a pen from Brussels, or retrospective court judgement, can take those rights away.</p> <p> And we will champion the common sense instincts of young people who know that the idea of creating artificial, centralised supra-national superstates is an idea left behind in the twentieth century as they plan their lives in the twenty-first.</p> <p> They too believe passionately that we should be making the most of being British. So I say to them, whatever else you might have thought about the Conservative Party and what we've done for Britain, it is only by coming with us that you can make sure that there will still be a Britain.</p> <p> Making the most of being British means that if taxes are lower in Britain than elsewhere in Europe we should be making them lower still to ensure that we keep our competitive advantages.</p> <p> Making the most of being British means that if our regulations are lighter than in Europe they should be lighter still for British businesses.</p> <p> And making the most of being British means that if other countries give up their currencies and take on the job of applying one set of rules to every economy across Europe, we should say: good luck, we wish them well, but we will keep our Pound.</p> <p> At the coming election, we will be the only Party committed to keeping the Pound, just as we will be the only Party committed to common sense on the countryside and on our inner cities, on crime, on education, on pensions, on health and on tax.</p> <p> As we approach this election, conscious of our responsibility to provide a new government, clear in our principles for which only we can stand, resolved in our purpose to serve the people of our country, we know who we are and what we promise to be.</p> <p> I don't promise the earth.</p> <p> I don't think we'll solve every problem.</p> <p> I don't think we'll avoid every mistake.</p> <p> I won't try to start new fads or fashions.</p> <p> I won't claim to be creating a new era.</p> <p> I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of the people of this country.</p> <p> I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of a proud people who believe in Britain.</p> <p> In place of squandered opportunity and high taxation, the determination to seize the opportunity of a new economy.</p> <p> In place of dogmatic interference and Whitehall knows best, the certain belief in the freedom of people to make their own choices about their schools and hospitals.</p> <p> In place of political correctness and the noise of the pressure group, the quiet trust in the tolerance and mutual respect of the British people.</p> <p> In place of fear on our streets and the menace of drugs, the absolute conviction that the war against crime can be won.</p> <p> In place of the cringeing surrender of our rights as a country, the confident assertion of our right to be a nation.</p> <p> I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of a people that believes in Britain and its values and institutions.</p> <p> I just want to bring to a people so deeply disillusioned by its Government,</p> <p> A Party that understands their concerns.</p> <p> A Party that shares their values.</p> <p> A Government that believes in our country.</p> <p> A Conservative Government, ready to govern for all the people.</p>",
  "Tory leader William Hague today used his conference speech to outline the key policies his party will fight the next election on. They include: <br> \u0095 Three pence off fuel duties and a restoration of the married couple's tax allowance. <br> \u0095 Giving education money - at a rate of \u00a3540 per pupil - direct to schools instead of education authorities and bringing in tougher discipline rules. <br> \u0095 Matching Labour \"penny for penny\" on health and getting rid of Labour's \"dogmatic\" opposition to private health care. <br> \u0095 Increasing police numbers and stepping up \"the war against drugs\". <br>\u0095 Attempting to rejuvenate inner cities by bulldozing the worst tower blocks. <br>\u0095 Championing the flexible Europe and a commitment at the next election to keep the pound. <br> \u0095 Increasing pensions by up to \u00a310 a week paid for by scrapping special allowances. <br> \u0095 Supporting the rural way of life. <br> \u0095 Reducing the number of ministers, cutting the size of the House of Commons and a halving of the number of special advisers. <br>\u0095 Halting the \"march of political correctness\" in government, local councils and schools. <br> <p>Mr Hague said a Tory government would care about and address the problems of the inner cities. </p> <p>\"The people who live on these council estates have never looked to the Conservative Party for support, but I believe passionately that we still have a duty to help them. </p> <p>\"We are going to reclaim their streets from the drug dealers and car thieves. </p> <p>\"We are going to bulldoze the worst of the concrete tower blocks and ensure that there are new low rise homes where the criminals won't be welcome.\" </p> <p>On the countryside, Mr Hague told the conference: \"Only the most out-of-touch, metropolitan elite could regard the attack on our rural life and the desperate plight of our farmers as a source of amusement. </p> <p>\"Yet, in speech after speech and joke after joke in Brighton last week, New Labour poked fun at the anger and hardship of the people of the countryside. </p> <p>\"This Government thinks it is attacking only a small rural minority. In fact it is attacking the values of tolerance and respect, the values of the mainstream majority.\" </p> <p>Mr Hague stressed Tories' commitment to the union. \"For we are ready to govern for all parts of the country - and by country I mean the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\" </p> <p>And he attacked the Government's approach to Europe. \"A Conservative government will only be able to do all of these things and govern for all the people if we still have a country left to govern at all. </p> <p>\"For this Labour Government is taking us down the road to a European superstate.\" </p> <p>On the single currency, Mr Hague said last week's no vote to the euro in the Danish referendum had \"once and for all demolished Labour's bogus arguments and scare tactics. </p> <p> \"Now we must champion the cause of a flexible, free trading, low tax, lightly regulated Europe - a Europe that goes with the grain of the new global economy, in which nations combine in different combinations for different purposes to different extents. </p> <p>\"We will be the champions of that flexible Europe. And we will be the champions of Britain's right to govern itself. For we believe in being in Europe, not run by Europe.\"</p> <p>Mr Hague has promised the conference he would put \u00a35.50 on every state pension and \u00a310-a-week on pensions for older citizens. </p> <p>He added: \"We're going to match Labour penny for penny on the NHS and sweep away Labour's dogmatic opposition to private provision. We're going to make sure every penny is spent on clinical priorities.\" </p> <p>Mr Hague went on to repeat his declaration that young workers could opt out of the state pension and make their own arrangements, adding: \"The British people know these things can be done and we're going to do them. </p> <p>\"For we're ready to govern for all the people. We're going to govern for all the law-abiding people of this country who have sometimes felt there wasn't a politician left prepared to champion their common sense values and instincts.\" </p> <p>He added: \"It's time we halted the march of political correctness.\" </p> <p>Mr Hague told representatives he was ready to order a crackdown on crime, with the end of early prison release schemes for rapists and burglars and muggers and the controversial plan outlined by shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe on Wednesday for stepping up the war against drugs.</p>",

David does, however, admire US rapper Puff Daddy, listing his <a href=\"http://www.puffdaddy.com/\" target=\"_new\">website</a> as one of his favourites.

But last night wasn't entirely the triumph of the teens. Woodstock veteran <a href=\"http://www.santana.com\" target=\"_new\">Carlos Santana</a>, whose career spans three decades and who has sold more than 50m records, was named best world music act.

  "<p>Kingston Communications' love affair with the residents of Hull is coming under strain just seven months after the former municipal phone company's elevation to the FTSE 100 sparked celebrations among locals and triggered the biggest financial windfall ever landed by a British city. </p> <p>A seven-fold rise in Kingston's share price that propelled it into the benchmark index in March made Hull city council the richest local authority in the country thanks to its \u00a32.5bn stake. The company's success had the one in three residents in the city who owned shares logging on to financial bulletin boards to check the value of their soaring portfolios. </p> <p>However, recent changes to the company's untimed internet access charges, combined with a fall in Kingston's share price that has seen it evicted from the FTSE 100 has soured relations with some customers to such an extent that they have nicknamed the firm \"Kingston-cons\". </p> <p>The criticisms stem from problems users experienced in connecting to the internet - which some claim made the service \"virtually unusable at times\" - and a subsequent rise in the price of untimed access charges from \u00a315 to \u00a325 per month. </p> <p>A web-based petition at <a href=\"http://www.kingston-comms.co.uk\">kingston-comms.co.uk</a> has been set up to allow customers to vent their anger. One posting reads: \"Kingston sort it out! I've seen better connections on my four-year-old's lego.\" </p> <p>A Kingston spokesman said yesterday that many of the sharper criticisms were unfair and that the company had taken steps to improve its technology and customer service. He added that the company felt its two subscription internet access offerings represented good value. </p> <p>Kingston pioneered unmetered internet access in March 1999 but, in common with many other service providers, found it was a loss-making activity and heavy usage created technical problems. </p> <p>\"We accept that a minority of customers have found the move to a higher charge of untimed access unacceptable, but the vast majority of our 10,000 customers have moved happily to the off-peak tariff,\" the spokesman said. </p> <p>Customers are now offered two tarriffs: all-day untimed access for \u00a325 per month and an off-peak evenings and weekend tariff for \u00a39.99. </p> <p>Kingston shares closed down 19p at 373p. </p> <p><strong>Links:</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.unmetered.org.uk\">Unmetered.org.uk</a> The Campaign for Unmetered Communications <br> <a href=\"http://www.kcltd.co.uk\">Kcltd.co.uk</a> Kingston Communications</p>",
  "<p>Nick Mustoe, chief executive at Mustoe Merriman Herring Levy, which handles the account for Imperial Tobacco, said he believed the government would now make a concerted effort to push through primary legislation and warned that this could lead to a blanket ban on tobacco ads.</p> <p>He said: \"We could see a blanket ban on tobacco advertising as soon as next spring assuming that the government can push primary legislation through smoothly. </p> <p>\"This is likely now to be more far-reaching - it could completely ban all print and poster advertising, put a block on all point of sale material as well as all database marketing, loyalty schemes and brand extension work.\"</p>",
  "<p>The advertising industry has welcomed the decision by the European Court of Justice to overrule EU plans to ban tobacco advertising. </p> <p>The move will come as an enormous relief to the tobacco industry, which has invested a huge amount of time and money fighting the EU crackdown on smoking and advertising. </p> <p>If the ban had gone through, it would have seen an end to billboard and cinema advertising by 2001, and newspaper and magazine adverts would have been made illegal by 2005. Sports tobacco advertising would have ceased by 2003, although Formula One had an extension until 2006. After that time the only tobacco ads allowed would have been in specialist trade journals and in-store promotions. </p> <p>Tobacco advertising on television is already banned in 15 EU countries.</p> <p>Rupert Howell, president of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, said this morning: \"Everyone tried telling the government that this would happen but it got on its high horse and wouldn't listen. This outcome was completely inevitable and the government should have been prepared to reach some compromise. The only option it left the tobacco industry was to take it to court.</p> <p>\"The voluntary codes of practice were increasingly putting restrictions on the tobacco industry's freedom to advertise. Deadlines were bought forward and then the whole Ecclestone affair caused great political embarassment, ensuring that everyone clammed up and stopped talking.\"</p> <p>Andrew Brown, director general at the Advertising Association, said that the government had ignored legal advice that it was likely to lose if the case went before the European Court of Justice. He added that for now certain restrictions will remain in place - all tobacco advertising will have to be certified before it breaks and limits on expenditure will remain.</p> <p>The campaign fell through on technical grounds, because the European Commission introduced the measures under EU single market legislation and not as a health and safety issue. Now that the judges have thrown out the ruling, the Commission is expected to reintroduce the plans as health and safety legislation before the end of the year. </p> <p>Tobacco companies have insisted for years that Brussels had no legal basis to legislate across the EU on advertising. But, the Commission chose to use the single market legislation because it requires only a qualified majority of member states to go through and is therefore quicker.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Names</strong><br> </p> <p> The British don't have Christian names as such, but identify each other by an elaborate range of nicknames, possibly derived from rhyming slang or Saxon folklore. British children will answer to Begbie, Spud, Sick Boy (Trainspotting), Spike (Notting Hill), Lomper and Horse (The Full Monty), Soap, Bacon, Dog and Plank (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) and their regional variants. </p> <p>As in ancient times, many British men are named for ease of identification with their trade, such as Tinker, an Irish labourer (The Crying Game), William Thacker, a bookshop owner in Notting Hill, or Mr Bean, a man whose escapades evoke the British love of toilet humour, engendered by the laxative effect of baked beans. (See sense of humour, below.) </p> <p>At the lower end of the social scale, nostalgia for the second world war still resonates, with chocks-away names such as Bunty (Chicken Run) and Daffy (The Beach) enjoying a resurgence, while at the higher end of the scale, anyone who isn't the Duke of Norfolk or the Earl of Sussex is called Charles or Rufus, or if they live in Scotland, Angus or \"Mac\". There aren't many women in Britain, but the few there are derive their names from US movie history (Scarlett, Four Weddings) or are called Victoria and Elizabeth and are the Queen of England. </p> <p><strong> The economy</strong><br> </p> <p> The engine of the British economy is driven by cannabis farming (Saving Grace; Lock, Stock), a booming cottage industry that fluctuates in accordance with the laws of plunder and gang in-fighting. Northern cities such as Sheffield used to be great centres of industry, but had to close when the demand for cutlery on the southern wedding circuit used up all their materials. There is a bitter divide between the prosperous south, where owners of money-losing bookshops maintain houses in London's most expensive districts, and the north, where levels of deprivation are such that repressed former steel workers have to strip to earn a crust and striking miners burn pianos for firewood. Ireland is mostly under water (Angela's Ashes). </p> <p><strong> Class system</strong><br> </p> <p> Britain operates on a more or less feudal system. Slave labour (allegorically addressed in Chicken Run) is a reality for the serfs who live north of the Wash and subsist on a diet of boiled eggs and amphetamines. Cultural deprivation has turned them wild: they underline their points by upsetting teacups and sob after their annual glass of wine at Christmas. Exposure to the Royal Ballet renders them infantile. </p> <p>Leisure activities in Britain are deeply divided by class. Children in the north of England start drinking cider at the age of 11, and their fathers box or pursue the popular working-class pastime of loitering (Billy Elliot; The Full Monty; Brassed Off). They are cold, but they've got rhythm. Middle-class men in the north of England collect garden gnomes, and those from the south attend the screening of foreign language films and learn sign language to better communicate with the deaf (Four Weddings). </p> <p>In Scotland, the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest is a daily reality, where drug addicts compete with Scottish nationalists on the streets of Glasgow and the highlands are populated by red-haired giants known as \"clansmen\", harbouring ancient hatreds and nursing glory in their hearts (Rob Roy). </p> <p><strong> Job opportunities</strong> </p> <p> Nobody in Britain works, except for a few caterers on the London party circuit and some Irish terrorists posing as builders. Instead, men of working age picket their employers for reasons unknown - possibly for a better dress allowance - and attend job clubs, converted classrooms in which they are tempted out of the iron age by being taught how to operate a word processor (The Full Monty). However, their permanent state of outrage renders most northern men unemployable. When their wives (or more probably, ex-wives) are prised out of the kitchen, it is only to work in an environment where they are permitted to smoke, such as a municipal hall, the fields, or behind the bar in a working men's club. </p> <p>The social commitments of the metropolitan elite make full-time work out of the question, although they play at the fringes of the more genteel trades, such as antiquarian book selling, the voluntary sector and the business of opening a restaurant. </p> <p><strong> Transport</strong> </p> <p> The National Express coach net work is the only way of travelling up and down the country, although it's a journey that few undertake, given the shock awaiting them on arrival. Men entering London from the north for the first time are disoriented by its lack of coalmines and the suspicion that all southern men are repressed homosexuals. Southern men taking the coach north close their eyes until they reach Scotland, when they are whisked away from the terminus to their highland estates (Four Weddings; Elizabeth; Mrs Brown). </p> <p>Londoners get around in four-wheel drive vehicles or hail a taxi, or if they are on urgent business, steal a van. There are buses in London, but they are decorative rather than functional and cater largely for the tourist market. In Scotland people make do with walking or, more commonly, running, with the law in pursuit. </p> <p><strong> Communication</strong> </p> <p> A Briton from the south who trips over a paving stone might exclaim \"oops-a-daisy\" (Notting Hill), whereas a northerner might say \"fook\". (Billy Elliot). A northerner defending himself against a verbal attack might plead \"keep your blob on\", which is patois for \"remain calm\". Other key words in the northerner's vocabulary are, \"twat\", \"wanker\", and \"chuffed\", and most northerners communicate by using combinations of these three basic terms. </p> <p>The Scottish speak a pidgin language that requires subtitles in more evolved parts of the English-speaking world. For example, \"fling yir fuckin jaykit oan well\" means \"hang your coat up\", and \"ye ken she's really intae ye\" stands for \"you know she finds you attractive\". \"Ya plukey-faced wee hing oot\" has no known English equivalent. </p> <p>In London, men affectionately greet each other as \"bruvver\", as in \"nice one, bruvver\", or \"geezer\", as in \"all right, geezer?\", or confine themselves to the universal greeting of the east end, \"safe\", which means, \"hello\" (Lock, Stock). </p> <p><strong> Dress</strong> </p> <p> The British are unjustly targeted as poor dressers, when in fact they adhere to a strict set of tribal dress codes. Donkey jackets are the uniform of the northern man, where the recession has hit the manufacture of any colour brighter than grey, and northern women wear gold hoops through their ears and tracksuit bottoms that have lost their elastic. In the south, it is customary for men to wear suits, with an optional cummerbund around the waist, and for women to wear wide hats and ethnic jewellery, or to dye their hair burnt orange in protest against the burden of privilege under which they live (Four Weddings). </p> <p><strong> Sex</strong> </p> <p> Sex in Britain, if it exists at all, is a quick and unfulfilling affair. British men prefer the company of other British men and are predominantly asexual (Mr Bean), unless they are pursuing the age-old highland sport of rape and pillage. Since most British women are either recently deceased, of retirement age, or members of the royal family, sex is off the agenda. They tend to regard men as feeble under-performers who don't live up to their fathers (A Fish Called Wanda) or as brutes liable to pawn their jewellery as soon as they hit the pathologist's slab (Billy Elliot). A British man called upon to court a woman will go through a series of extraordinary contortions, culminating in a slapstick attempt to embrace her and ending in total humiliation, probably in his socks and underpants (Notting Hill). When it comes to sex, most British men would rather sit on a park bench reading Captain Corelli's Mandolin or marry their labradors. </p> <p><strong> Sense of humour</strong> </p> <p> Since the British laugh at their own shortcomings, they are in a perpetual state of amusement. They are particularly aroused by stories turning on the triumph of the underdog, such as a boy from a northern housing estate getting into the Royal Ballet school, hens escaping from a slaughterhouse, or a humble bookseller from Notting Hill wooing a Hollywood movie star with hilarious consequences. </p> <p>When the underdog spills things, walks into doors and is caught picking his nose by the object of his affection, the average Briton will be diverted for hours. Anyone who speaks in an accent three or more counties removed from his listener is guaranteed a delirious audience. </p> <p><strong>Big over there</strong></p> <p>1 Notting Hill (1999) $116.1m </p> <p>2 Chicken Run (2000) $106m </p> <p>3 The Crying Game (1992) $62.5m </p> <p>4 Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) $52.7m </p> <p>5 The Full Monty (1997) $45.9m </p> <p>6 Bean (1997) $45.3m </p> <p>7 The Beach (2000) $39.8m </p> <p>8 The Lawnmower Man (1992) $32.1m </p> <p>9 Rob Roy (1995) $31.6m </p> <p>10 Elizabeth (1998) $30m</p>",
  "<p><strong> Bags of trouble</strong> </p> <p> As the last of the summer is gusted away, many of you are still sobbing over the ruination of your holiday dreams thanks to the incompetence of airlines. At Athens airport I overheard a British youth refusing to check his rucksack into the hold because, he claimed, he'd had stuff filched from his bag previously. Airport officials spirited him off to be dealt with; I checked my luggage on to the same flight and found it had been pilfered when it reappeared in London. </p> <p>The unhappy truth is that airlines can force you to surrender your possessions to their care, but bear little or no responsibility if things go wrong. </p> <p><strong> Case for compensation</strong> </p> <p> Ken Hutchinson of Sale, Cheshire, had intended to show his daughter the town in the former East Germany where he worked as a prisoner of war. Alas, their luggage did not follow them to Berlin. Lufthansa promised it would arrive on the next flight to Berlin. It didn't. Then it was to be delivered overnight. It wasn't. Lufthansa said it had been put on the wrong aircraft and would be there the following afternoon. It wasn't. That evening they were told there was no trace of the luggage on the computer; the next morning they learnt that one suitcase had shown up, but it was up to them to collect it; the other, containing vital medication for his daughter's back problems, had not. \"By then my daughter had used up all her tablets in her hand luggage and was in such distress that she took an early flight home,\" says Hutchinson. He hoped to recoup the cost of the spoiled holiday from Lufthansa but has only received \u00a357. </p> <p><strong> The overbook club</strong><br> </p> <p> Sumita Datta of Basingstoke didn't even manage to get herself, let alone her luggage, on her Air India flight to London. In the morning of her departure she was rung by airline officials wanting to confirm her seat, and she arrived at check-in three hours early as advised. She was told, however, that the flight had been overbooked and there were no seats available. She and numerous others were told to come back the next day. </p> <p><strong> Poorly treated</strong><br> </p> <p>Harold Fineberg of London and his wife booked a package to China involving several internal flights, but family illness prevented him from travelling on the scheduled date. Instead he bought another flight out and proposed to continue with the holiday as planned, but Air China informed him that the rest of the package was invalid because of his altered departure. Air China explained that it was governed by International Air Transport Association rules, which state that flight coupons must be used in date order or be forfeited, although, too late, it offered to amend his booking for \u00a360 as a goodwill gesture. </p> <p> \u0095Faithful followers of this page will already be aware of the bizarre rules governing airline liability. For instance, you get a maximum of \u00a314 per kilo if your luggage is lost, a sum set by the Warsaw Convention in 1929. If it's delayed you're supposed to get money to fund emergency kit, provided you have receipts, but there's no scale to determine how much you get under specific circumstances. And the Air Transport Users' Council (AUC) reports that complaints about mishandled baggage have risen by a third in the past year. </p> <p>As for overbooking, displaced passengers get 300 euros if they are travelling more than 3,500km, and that's halved if they arrive within four hours of their original scheduled time. Business travellers pay over the odds for tickets that entitle them to skip their flight without notice and claim a refund. It's to ensure that their empty seats are filled that airlines overbook, and it's the poorer passengers on use-it-or-lose-it tickets who must bear the consequences. </p> <p>There is happier news on the horizon. This year's AUC annual report highlighted unfair contract terms which protect airlines and discriminate against passengers, and the office of fair trading has since ordered changes. These will include refunds if the airline is to blame for significant flight delays or if it reschedules flights without warning and can't provide an acceptable alternative. Passengers with non-refundable tickets will receive a credit note if unforeseen events prevent them from travelling. And if, for reasons beyond their control, they can't use a portion of their ticket, they'll no longer be barred from using return or onward flights. A while ago we related the case of a Ryanair customer who had to check in a pushchair and sign a limited release form absolving the airline from blame if it was damaged in the hold (which it was). Now Ryanair has agreed to accept responsibility for bulky or fragile luggage. And should Ken Hutchinson's suitcase be delayed again, the airline will have to deliver it to his hotel. \"The old terms unnecessarily compromised air passengers' rights and gave airlines unreasonable advantages,\" says John Bridgeman, the director general of the OFT. \"These changes will ensure that airline contracts are much fairer.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 020-7713 4731, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at <a href=\"mailto\" consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "A European Union ban on tobacco advertising was today ruled unlawful by the European court of justice. The 1998 directive had called for the phasing out of all tobacco advertising and sponsorship by 2006, but the EU's highest court ruled that the commission had \"no power\" to introduce the ban under single market legislation. <p>The court's ruling followed a demand by the German government to cancel the directive, and a complaint by Imperial Tobacco Group plc and other tobacco producers, referred by the UK courts.</p> <p>The court said the directive should not have been adopted as an EU internal market directive aimed at removing market distortions. Germany and the producers argued it was a public health measure. </p> <p>The commission chose to use its single market provisions partly because EU laws on the single market only require a qualified majority of member states to approve them. Germany and Austria had opposed the original directive banning tobacco advertising. </p> <p>The commission is expected to attempt another ban under health and safety issues before the end of the year.</p> <p>John Carlyle, executive director of public affairs of the Tobacco Manufacturers Association, said: \"We welcome this judgment as we have always believed that the European Commission and the British government were acting illegally. </p> <p>\"We now hope that the government will talk with the industry and we look forward to talking to them.</p> <p>\"We still believe that we have the right to communicate with our adult customers to sell a legally available product and we will fight to retain that right.\"</p> <p>The court found that a publicity ban did not do away with distortions of competition between EU member states, which could be because of different production costs. </p> <p>\"The court estimates that a general ban on advertising for a large range of forms (posters, umbrellas, ash trays, hotel objects, film trailers) does not contribute to easing trade in the products,\" it also said. </p> <p>However, the court noted that some measures partially banning certain forms of publicity and sponsorship could be acceptable as an internal market measure. </p> <p>Different national rules, such as a ban on sponsorship in certain member states, can distort competition by determining where a sports competition may take place and affect the firms involved, it said. </p> <p>The publishing industry, as well as tobacco companies, had been arguing for years that Brussels had no legal basis for attempting to legislate across the EU on advertising.</p>",

  "Israel and the Palestinians have agreed a fresh ceasefire in the strife-torn West Bank and Gaza strip after peace talks broke down in acrimony early today. <p>Israeli officials said Palestinian president Yasser Arafat had made a verbal agreement to halt the bloodshed. It is the fourth ceasefire since violence erupted in the region a week ago; three previous truces have collapsed quickly. There were no immediate reports of major clashes this morning, though on previous days street battles have usually erupted later in the day. </p> <p>An army spokesman said that, during the night, the commander of Israel's central command, Major-General Yitzhak Eitan, had met senior officials of the Palestinian security services. \"It was agreed at the meeting to stop the violence, disturbances and shooting incidents at confrontation points between the two sides,\" a statement said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, will try and pick up the pieces after her failed attempt to broker an agreement to end the violence.</p> <p>After initial optimism, a marathon session of talks in Paris between the Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Mr Arafat broke up without agreement. </p> <p>At one point, Mr Arafat briefly stormed out of the meeting, returning only after Mrs Albright persuaded him to do so. Mr Barak has refused so far to attend a second round of talks in Egypt, brokered by President Hosni Mubarak. Mr Arafat held talks with the Egyptian leader this morning, and Mrs Albright is also heading for the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik.</p> <p>The Palestinian leader was angered by the Israeli and American refusal to set up an international inquiry into the recent bloodshed in Israel and the Palestinian areas. UN secretary general Kofi Annan, who joined the Paris talks late in the day, agreed to work with the Americans to devise a formula acceptable to both the Israelis and the Palestinians for an investigation. </p> <p>The session finally ended at dawn with Mr Barak saying he saw no point in going to Egypt later in the day as planned for more talks. He and Mr Arafat predictably blamed each other for the impasse, as they have for the week of violence which has wracked the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Arab towns in Israel, killing at least 66 people, most of them Palestinians. </p> <p>The stumbling block was Israel's rejection of the Palestinian demand for an international inquiry. Israel does not want any other foreign powers besides the United States, its traditional ally, to join the process. But the Palestinians want experts representing other powers. </p> <p>Israel's acting foreign minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, said in Israel that an international inquiry would have involved too many parties at a time when Israel hoped to focus on reaching a final peace deal with the Palestinians within two weeks. A senior US official said the Americans still hoped to pin down an agreement to end the violence. </p> <p>In the Paris talks, Israel offered to pull back tanks and personnel carriers from forward positions on the West Bank and Gaza, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials. Mr Arafat was willing to order his followers to avoid sites of recent clashes. </p> <p>In Paris, Mrs Albright held two rounds of separate talks with each of the leaders before convening the three-way session. She had urged Mr Barak and Mr Arafat to return to the \"psychology of peacemaking.\" </p> <p>The worst violence in the West Bank and Gaza broke out after a 28 September visit to Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque compound by right-wing Israeli politician Ariel Sharon, escorted by hundreds of security personnel. </p>",

  "<p>Two weeks ago I became the fifth female editor to leave Pride magazine under less than satisfactory circumstances in just four years. </p> <p>I was forced to take the silver medal in the editor-for-the-shortest-time category behind the holder Clare Gorham (she left after two issues). I managed to endure two months and produced three well-received issues including this month's, which is the biggest ever.</p> <p>As Britain's only glossy black women's lifestyle magazine, Pride has no rivals. Close to its 10th birthday, it holds a prime position on the newsstands - often wedged between Elle and New Woman. Yet it seems to have a credibility problem. When I said yes to the job after two months of intense negotiation in July, the response from fellow journalists left me feeling as if I should check myself into The Priory.</p> <p>'Are you sure you know what you're doing?' exclaimed a journalist friend of mine. 'Do you realise that the job should be advertised with a health warning?' another declared cryptically. You exaggerate, I said. Now I'm not so sure. The lack of editorial vision and a consistent commitment to BBT (Black British Talent) are behind my decision to call it quits. There is more to black British women than the salacious, sexy and stereotypical. Their leisure activities stretch beyond fawning over American R'n'B celebrities, tending to their hair and gossiping.</p> <p>Yes, these items have their place, but as part of a broader, culturally diverse and exciting editorial landscape which all women's magazines are failing to embrace. Black women are earning more money, gaining more qualifications and taking more cultural risks. They read novels (not just Terry Macmillan or Alice Walker), listen to diverse music including pap-pop and indie, travel to countries other than Jamaica, Ghana and the US, and are looking for their soul mate. </p> <p>Trying to produce a 120 (and now 160) page magazine with five editorial staff (two part-time) without the ability to plan ahead more than a month is ridiculous. I had more bylines than my freelancers. Yet assisted by the overworked but sterling staff, I managed to get an exclusive with Guy Ritchie on his 'there aren't any good black actors row' which was picked up as a news lead in the Evening Standard. </p> <p>And this month we pulled off a coup by convincing top designer Wale Adeyemi to design a breast cancer awareness tee-shirt, the MOBO Awards to sponsor it and 25 talented black British celebrities to model them with a two-and-a-half week deadline. Oh, and we got singing sensation Kelis to exclusively reveal that she hates the white rap megastar, Eminem, and finds him talented but demented.</p> <p>Letters from black, Asian and white women arrived expressing support and an appreciation of the editorial variety - from sexual health to meditation. And former readers appeared to be slowly coming back to the fold.</p> <p>Pride has a tough job. It is catering for a broad spectrum of black women from 25 to 34 years old. It exists because the zillions of women's magazines, more recently Bare and Nova, are still colour blind (apart from Mel B and Naomi Campbell).</p> <p>So I was less than happy to be faced with a male publisher who wanted to dictate the editorial terms of reference and backtrack on editorial commitments. But to be told by a male MD that 'he sets the tone' of the magazine was bordering on the farcical and led to the question 'Well why am I here?'</p> <p>They have yet to provide an answer. And until they do, the editor revolving door syndrome will continue.</p> <p>\u0095 Joy Francis is the former editor of Pride magazine and director of the Creative Collective media consultancy.</p>",
  "<p>Virgin Net is expected to complete its divorce from NTL, owner of 49% of Virgin Net, by the end of next week, a move that will take Virgin out of the ISP market.</p> <p>NTL is understood to be paying around \u00a3100m, of which 10% will be in cash and the remainder in NTL common stock.</p> <p>The deal will leave Virgin in sole control of the Virgin Net content and commerce business, while NTL will take on all the dial-up ISP subscribers, of which there are believed to be around 500,000. Overnight NTL will become one of the leading ISPs in the UK - NTL reckons the Virgin Net subscribers will take its ISP user tally to 1m, which would thrust it into third place in the UK ISP stakes. </p> <p>After the two have gone their separate ways, Virgin Net will exist only as an entertainment portal, although it's likely to take the best part of a year before the consumer branding is changed and Virgin Net subscribers are fully migrated into NTL's ISP. Sources have suggested that the imminent parting of ways was the reason why Virgin Net has recently put its plans for unmetered access on hold, and that this plan will simply be rolled into NTL's unmetered package, NTLWorld.</p> <p>NTL and Virgin Net announced their proposed separation at the start of August, almost a year after the development was first internally mooted at Virgin Net. The two parties have worked together on Virgin Net since the end of 1996 when it was agreed that NTL would provide the backbone and Virgin would develop the front-end, the content and handle all the marketing for the ISP. However, rumours started speculating about a year ago that Virgin Net was not happy with the quality of the service provided by NTL. Reports in the press at the time suggested a spat over plans to float Virgin Net, which was being pushed by NTL, and talked about a strained relationship and dual-sourcing (using two different backbone providers) using Cable &amp; Wireless' network. </p> <p>Since then the Virgin Group has developed a more integrated new media strategy and set up a separate business, Virgin.com, which acts as a portal for the whole group. The remnants of Virgin Net will be tied much tighter into Virgin.com. However inside sources have suggested that the Virgin Group has given the Virgin Net portal six months to prove it can stand on its own two feet before it reassesses its role.</p>",
  "<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is interested in buying Russia's biggest and most influential independent media group, according to reports in Moscow, though any deal would be controversial. </p> <p>The Media-most company of exiled mogul Vladimir Gusinsky is at the centre of a bitter battle for control of its assets with the Kremlin and Mr Gusinsky's main creditor, Gazprom, Russia's gas monopoly. It includes Russia's biggest private television channel, NTV, cable TV operations, a Moscow radio station, and a daily newspaper. </p> <p>Rem Vyakhirev, the powerful head of Gazprom, Russia's biggest company which is part-owned by the state, said he was insisting on taking over Media-most and selling it on unless Mr Gusinsky came up with the $211m (\u00a3144m) it owes and a further $272m due for repayment next year. </p> <p>\"We are demanding the return of the debt. This is not politics,\" said Mr Vyakhirev in Delhi, where he is accompanying President Putin on an official visit. \"If they can't pay the money, we'll take the Media-most shares and sell them to someone who will pay more.\" </p> <p>An western media holding company was showing an interest, he added. Gazprom sources told the Kommersant newspaper the prospective buyer was News Corp, which had shown its interest \"orally and in written form\". </p> <p>Martin Pompadur, an executive vice-president of News Corporation in charge of European operations, was understood to be on business in Russia this week, but News Corp declined to comment on what it called speculation. </p> <p>There is no sizeable foreign ownership of the media in Russia as the sector is heavily indebted and barely profitable. A foreign takeover of such a substantial group could cause political problems for Mr Putin, with communists and nationalists complaining of the country's second biggest TV channel becoming anti-Russian. </p> <p>Mr Gusinsky fled Russia for Spain in July after his offices were raided by heavily armed paramilitary police and he was briefly jailed. Criminal charges against him were suddenly dropped in return for his selling out to Gazprom. This agreement he now says was signed, under duress and at gunpoint. </p> <p>Dmitry Ostalsky, a spokesman in Moscow for Mr Gusinsky, said he knew nothing of the proposed Murdoch bid. \"We've got nothing against western investors, but, of course, this is not normal because Gazprom does not own Media-most.\" </p> <p>Mr Vyakhirev said that under the deal signed on July 20, the gas company agreed to take on all of Media-most's debt and pay Mr Gusinsky a further $300m. </p> <p>The signing of that agreement was the prelude to Mr Gusinsky's flight to Spain. Three weeks ago a row erupted in public between Gazprom and Media-most when Mr Gusinsky repudiated it and produced a confidential appendix, signed by a government minister, promising him his freedom and the dropping of all charges as a trade-off for surrendering the business. </p> <p>NTV television has become the president's most formidable and most influential critic. The months-long battle for control of Media-most has raised fears in the West for press freedoms in Russia.</p>",
  "A prime time news broadcast of child pornography has stunned Italy, triggered political uproar and exposed cronyism in the state-owned RAI television network. <p>Graphic images of children being tortured and apparently murdered were followed within minutes by an apology which in turn led to resignations and allegations of rampant corruption.</p> <p>Interrupting programmes to make an emotional late night broadcast, Gad Lerner accepted responsibility for the fiasco and quit as news director of RAI's first channel.</p> <p>Shaking with anger, he attempted to scalp a political opponent in the process. Mr Lerner claimed the chairman of the parliamentary commission on the media, Mario Landolfi, had pressured him during lunch. </p> <p>\"When coffee came, he took out a scrap of paper and told me: 'There's this person to fix up, if possible.'\"</p> <p>Confirming widespread suspicions that RAI's three state-owned channels were riddled with patronage, the scandal has catapulted media ownership back on to the agenda in the run-up to the general election.</p> <p>The centre-left government backed Mr Lerner and demanded the resignation of Mr Landolfi, a member of the right-wing National Alliance opposition party.</p> <p>Mr Landolfi admitted he made the request but said it was legitimate since his friend was already employed by the channel. The opposition branded RAI a hotbed of government-appointed leftists who would say anything to destroy opponents.</p> <p>The affair broke last week when Russian and Italian police discovered an international paedophile network selling pornography videos to clients in Italy, American and Germany.</p> <p>That evening's news on RAI One and RAI Tre illustrated the story with images of a man apparently raping a boy to death. Another showed a man having sex with a little girl. Complaints jammed the switchboards within seconds.</p> <p>Aldo Grasso, one of Italy's most respected television critics, said the broadcasts were symptomatic of a plunge in standards. \"Editors are driven not by quality or responsibility toward viewers but only the ratings.\"</p> <p>The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano blasted a cult of sensational images and said the broadcasts had violated Italian families in the guise of news. An anchorman and two assistant news directors immediately resigned and the government promised an inquiry. Days later Mr Lerner made his broadcast.</p> <p>Although he had not viewed the news clips in advance he took corporate responsibility and resigned. However he had been infuriated by \"hypocritical\" attacks from centre-right politicians who had lobbied him for jobs.</p> <p>Mr Landolfi was \"the same person who in recent days has asked me resign in a gesture of freedom and consistency\".</p> <p>An uneasy balance exists in Italian broadcasting. The centre-left effectively controls RAI and Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the centre-right coalition, owns the three Mediaset channels. Should Mr Berlusconi win the next election, as polls indicate, he will in theory be able to control RAI as well.</p> <p>Upon its election in 1996 the centre-left vowed to reform the system and make RAI meritocratic, if not independent. That never happened and whoever wins office effectively wins the network.</p> <p>That tantalising prospect was what fuelled the opposition's attacks on Mr Lerner, claimed the government. Accusing each other of being thuggish and disgusting, the row is set to simmer until the election which is due by April 2001. Mr Lerner has been replaced by Albino Longhi, who has been head of the channel twice before.</p>",
  "Imperial nationalism is bad because it is imperial, not because it is nationalist. It is worth recalling that most empires have been constructed on behalf of dynasties, religions, or secular ideologies such as Marxism-Leninism. Cultural nationalism, as a rule, is too inward-looking to serve as the basis of an imperial ideology. Nazi Germany is often held up as an example of the evils of nationalism, but Hitler's ideology was a kind of racist transnationalism, which held that all true \"Aryans\" were kin, whether they shared a common language and culture or not. Anyway, imperial nationalisms are greatly outnumbered by anti-imperial nationalisms, for the simple reason that small ethnic nations have enough trouble holding their own without trying to conquer their regions, much less the world. The purpose of most nationalists is nothing more sinister than trying to preserve the identity of a relatively small ethnic and linguistic community by achieving and maintaining independence as a sovereign political community. <p>This is why it is so absurd to blame the world wars of the 20th century on the nationalist movements in the Balkans. Nationalism in the decaying Habsburg empire was the trigger of the first world war, not the cause. The cause of the first world war was Germany's ambition to become the dominant world power by becoming the dominant European power - an ambition which threatened the interests of Russia, France, Britain, and the US - empires all.</p> <p>Instead of blaming nationalism for 20th-century wars which were really caused by imperial rivalries, we should give some credit to the stubborn and defiant particularism of anti-fascist and anti-communist nationalists in Europe and Asia for defeating the transnational tyrannies of National Socialism and communism. Nationalists from France to Poland to Greece battled heroically to stop their countries from being melted down into Hitler's New Order; and nationalists from central Asia to the Baltic republics brought down the Soviet empire when the Soviet elite no longer had the nerve to hold it together by terror. Some of those anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet nationalists were democrats; some were not. But even the partisans and the dissidents who did have democratic values did not want democracy in the abstract. They wanted democracy for their people - the Danes, the Ukrainians, the Lithuanians, the Poles. Thanks in part to their battles for \"narrow\" and \"ethnocentric\" national self-determination, the world was saved from domination by supra-national totalitarianism. Johann Gottfried von Herder wrote in 1791: \"How wonderfully has Nature separated nations, not only by woods and mountains, seas and deserts, rivers and climates, but most particularly by languages, inclinations and characters, [so] that the work of subjugating despotism might be rendered more difficult...\" </p> <p>Critics of nationalism often assume that national sentiment is somehow incompatible with democracy. In fact, the relationship tends to be the other way around. Almost all stable democracies are nation-states, while multinational states tend to be dictatorships. The reason is simple. In a mono-ethnic society, ethnic power is not an issue; whichever party wins in Sweden will be made up of Swedes. That means that there can be political coalitions based on various other aspects of identity - class, or religion, or political ideology. But in a multi-ethnic society, political parties usually coalesce around the main ethnic groups. Each ethnic group is afraid that the others will seize control of the machinery of government. In Belgium, the Flemings worry that the Walloons will be too powerful; in Canada, the Anglo-Canadians and Quebecois eye one another with distrust. At worst, as in Yugoslavia and Lebanon, the competition between ethnic parties escalates into war. </p> <p>Only Tito's dictatorship held the Yugoslav federation together. The Soviet Union broke up along national lines the moment that a degree of democracy was permitted. There are very few stable multi-ethnic democracies. The ones that do exist - such as Switzerland - tend to be based on intricate constitutional arrangements such as elaborate systems of federalism and equally elaborate systems of power-sharing. Political philosophers and Op-Ed columnists can have fun devising intricate power-sharing schemes for a multi-ethnic Bosnia or a multi-ethnic Kosovo. But realistic policymakers have to face the fact that power-sharing systems seldom work. </p> <p>Where a state like Yugoslavia has crumbled because its constituent ethnic nations do not want to live together, it is folly for outsiders to try to force them together in a shotgun marriage - or rather a shotgun remarriage. In such circumstances, it is in the interest of all concerned that the outside powers act as divorce counsellors, seeing to it that the divorce takes place with as little bloodshed as possible. The wisest course may be to turn temporary division into permanent partition, and to recognise formally the existence of new nation-states. The results will not always be fair: some individuals will not be able to return to their homes; some groups will find themselves minorities trapped behind new borders. But in diplomacy as in the rest of life, the perfect is the enemy of the good. The rough justice of partition may be acceptable if it prevents endless warfare or endless peacekeeping. </p> <p>The Balkans is not the only place where there may never be lasting peace or prosperity until borders are redrawn, at least roughly, along national lines. In sub-Saharan Africa, most of the states are artificial creations of British and French colonial administrators. The map of African governments cuts across the map of African ethnic nations. There is no Nigerian or South African nation, any more than there was a Yugoslav or Soviet nation. One reason why so many African states are dictatorships is that force is required to prevent these artificial contraptions from breaking down in civil war among the rival ethnic nations, like the Hutu and Tutsi in Rwanda and Burundi. (Incidentally, one of the unfortunate residues of western racism and imperialism is the tendency to describe the nations of western Europe as nations, the nations of eastern Europe as ethnic groups, and the nations of Africa as tribes.) Any attempt to make political borders correspond with ethnic nations in Africa, as in the Balkans, would be messy and imperfect. But the alternative - preserving the political relics of European colonialism forever at the cost of endless authoritarianism and internecine conflict and the poverty which comes in their wake - is much worse than redrawing a border here and a border there.</p> <p>Needless to say, most of the several thousand ethnic groups in the world are too small to have states of their own - although the example of the Slovenes proves that statehood is possible for very tiny nations. The Sorbs and Wends of Germany will never have their own nation-states, any more than the German-speaking Amish in the US will have theirs. But the fact that every tiny ethnic group does not qualify for statehood does not discredit the desire for independence of substantial ethnic nations like the Kurds.</p> <p>At what point would there be too many countries? Between 1945 and today, the number of UN member states increased from 51 to 188. The addition of a dozen or two dozen more nation-states would not create chaos. At any given time, there are only a few great military and economic powers, and it is on their relations among themselves, not the number of small states, that international order depends.</p> <p>Most nation-states are relatively small, but this need not be a handicap. A small nation-state can take advantage of commercial economies of scale by joining the global market or a trading bloc like the EU or Asean; and it can take advantage of military economies of scale by joining a military alliance like Nato. Because of its political sovereignty, a nation-state, even a small, weak, nation-state, can negotiate the nature of its relations with its trading partners and its military allies. This is something no ethnic minority in a multinational state can ever do.</p> <p>In this connection, it is useful to distinguish internationalism from transnationalism. Internationalism presupposes the existence of distinct nations which interact with one another on a voluntary basis. Transnationalism posits the disappearance of nation-states and their replacement by something else - sub-national tribes, supra-national blocs.</p> <p>While the supposed trend toward transnationalism is a mirage, the growth of internationalism is real. It is more a consequence of the end of the cold war and the division of the countries of the world into rival camps than of the internet or trade treaties. There is no contradiction between the multiplication of nation-states and increasing international integration. Slovenia escaped from its involuntary membership in Yugoslavia, and immediately applied for admission to Nato and the EU. It is an abuse of language to say that when a country joins a military alliance or a trading bloc it is \"surrendering its sovereignty.\" On the contrary, it is exercising its sovereignty, so long as it retains the option to quit the alliance or trading bloc if it so chooses.</p> <p>The globalisation of commerce is an example of internationalism, not transnationalism. A Norwegian may order a product from Thailand over the internet. But he is still a Norwegian; the Norwegian government can tax and conscript him, the Thai government cannot; and it is the Norwegian government, not the Thai government, which provides for his health care and his state pension out of taxes levied on his fellow Norwegians. Globalisation is reshaping nations - but it is not replacing them.</p> <p>All of this raises an interesting question. If the nation-state is alive and well, and if nationalism is by no means the evil that it is made out to be, then why is there so much loathing of nationalism and propaganda in favour of various kinds of supra-national systems of world order? One reason is obvious: most of the states in Africa, and the middle east, and much of Asia, are non-national entities whose borders are threatened by nationalist movements. The UN should really be called the United Regimes, inasmuch as many of the members of the general assembly are multinational states held together by repression. For obvious reasons, many of these governments would prefer that self-determination be sacrificed to the sanctity of inherited borders, no matter how absurd and anachronistic the borders are. But this doesn't explain the intense hostility to nationalism in the western media, and all of the addled talk about the nation-state withering away. </p> <p>Every segment of the political spectrum in the west - left, centre and right - has its own fantasy version of cosmopolis. The socialist left, for almost two centuries, has hoped, in the face of all evidence, that international class loyalties will eventually prevail over inter-class national loyalties. Libertarians hope to reduce countries to nothing more than postcodes in the free global market. The influence of Protestant millenarianism and evangelism can be seen on British liberal internationalism and American Wilsonian liberalism. There is even a kind of conservative internationalism - although it is that of reactionary traditionalists such as John Lukacs, nostalgic for a pre-national, aristocratic European Christendom, rather than of the populists and nationalists who dominate the right in most western countries. (Given that most of literate, civilised humanity lived for most of history under non-national empires - some, like China and Rome, of long duration and lasting cultural importance - it is surprising that there is not more of this kind of conservative nostalgia for imperial civilisations.)</p> <p>Whether the chattering classes like it or not, a century from now there will be more nation-states in the world, and fewer multinational states. Nation-states like Japan and Russia and China and the US and Germany and India and Brazil, in some form, will still be here. But many if not most of today's multinational states will have vanished from the map. The UK may give way to a federation of the nation-states of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. Australia and New Zealand will be sovereign republics. Canada is unlikely to survive the 21st century; the only question is whether the English-speaking provinces join the US or stragggle along on their own, when the federation dissolves. Indonesia and Malaysia may be replaced on the map by a number of new, smaller countries. Not all of the nationalism of the century ahead will be disintegrative. A Greater Albania and a Kurdistan might be cobbled together. The inevitable overthrow of the remaining monarchies in the middle east may produce the amalgamation of portions of the Arab world, a region where the present borders were drawn up generations ago by the colonial bureaucrats of Britain and France. Not every nation will obtain its state: China is unlikely to free Tibet; and India is unlikely to consent to a Sikh nation-state. Whether Africa progresses or continues to decay depends in large part on whether the international community permits genuine nation-states to be formed from the wreckage of the post-colonial regimes. In some cases, such as the break-up of the UK, these changes might occur without bloodshed; in other cases they may be accompanied by immense suffering, and may even trigger conflicts among rival great powers. </p> <p>A case can be made that, on the whole, the good which has come with replacing multinational dynastic empires and dictatorships with nation-states which at least have a chance to become stable liberal democracies, has outweighed the bad which often accompanies the break-up of non-national states. In any event, the future seems clear. The 19th century was a century of nationalism. The 20th century was also a century of nationalism. In all likelihood, the 21st century will be a century of nationalism as well. </p> <p>Michael Lind is senior fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington DC and writes fiction, non-fiction and poetry. </p> <p>\u00a9 Prospect 2000</p>",
  "The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, agreed to withdraw tanks and armoured personnel carriers from the West Bank and Gaza after a night of tense negotiations in Paris with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. <p>As fighting raged at home, with seven Palestinians killed by Israeli fire, the two leaders jousted with each other late into the night.</p> <p>At one point Mr Arafat stormed out of the talks at the US ambassador's residence, angered by the Israeli and US refusal to set up an international inquiry into the bloodshed which has claimed 66 lives. He returned only after a plea from Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state.The Israeli decision to pull back its heavy armour to bases in Israeli controlled territory is a return to the position before the week of violence started. But this does allow the talks to continue in Egypt today with the participation of the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak.</p> <p>Earlier, both Mr Barak and Mr Arafat strenuously resisted a face-to-face meeting, with Mr Barak declaring he would not be willing to see Mr Arafat until the violence had ended.</p> <p>Mr Barak said :\"It is only self-defense that is executed in these places.\" He called for \"a clear-cut order from Chairman Arafat to his own militias and policemen to stop shooting and everything will calm down immediately.\" Mr Arafat, decried the \"serious massacre which is being perpetrated against the Palestinian people.\"</p> <p>Mr Arafat said he would not consent to talks until he had guarantees for the safety of his people and an inquiry was set up into the six days of violence. In Gaza, Israeli forces showed no signs of bowing to international pressure over their response to waves of stone-throwing youths. A 13-year-old Palestinian died after being shot in the chest in clashes at the flashpoint Netzarim junction and a helicopter gunship unleashed salvos of rockets into apartment blocks in which gunmen had taken up positions. A 21-year-old Palestinian was shot dead in the ensuing firefight.</p> <p>In the northern West Bank town of Tulkarem, a 22-year-old Palestinian man was shot dead in a protracted firefight and in the divided town of Hebron, a 19-year-old died in one of several exchanges of fire between a hilltop in the Palestinian sector and the Israeli-controlled downtown sector below, where the army imposed a curfew on 30,000 Palestinian residents.</p> <p>The violence crept closer to Jerusalem. Palestinians shot at four homes in the Jewish neighbourhood of Gilo on the southern edge of the city, police said. There were no injuries.</p> <p>Earlier yesterday, Mr Barak said it was up to the Palestinians to decide if they wanted a peace agreement.</p> <p>\"We hold Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority responsible for the initiation of this wave of violence,\" Mr Barak said. \"We are not initiating any violence, but every morning youngsters accompanied by Palestinian soldiers are opening fire on Israeli citizens.\"</p> <p>Mr Barak said that a peace agreement was within reach, but added that it was his job to defend the citizens of Israel and that he would do it to the last. \"We are not living in western Europe or in America,\" he said. \"We live in a tough neighbourhood and we must protect our citizens and soldiers.\"</p> <p>Mr Arafat said after his meeting with President Chirac that he wanted guarantees of protection for his people and an inquiry into the causes of violence. Asked what his conditions were for a tripartite meeting, he said: \"Protection and an international inquiry commission.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's clashes in the Gaza Strip were less ferocious than in early days, but the marked reluctance of some 38,000 Palestinian police in the West Bank and Gaza to take harsh measures to restrain their protesters means this week-long spasm of violence may not be spent.</p> <p>Tensions are also simmering among Arab citizens of Israel, where thousands of acres of forest were ablaze in more than 100 arson attacks by suspected protesters.</p> <p>Outside the Israeli army bunker at Netzarim junction, a crossroads in the Gaza Strip that was the scene of the bloodiest clashes this week, crowds of young Palestinians collected in the early afternoon, drifting away from the procession of mourners carrying the flag-draped funeral shroud of a young man killed a day earlier.</p> <p>They chanted \"Allahu Akbar\" and advanced in waves on the Israeli post, scattering, or throwing themselves to the ground when bursts of live rounds were let loose. \"I was very scared,\" said Hanan al-Habiba, 18.</p> <p>When one man was wounded, fellow protesters, trying to keep as low to the ground as they could, dragged and pushed him 300 yards to an ambulance, passing him from one person to the next.</p> <p>A handful of Palestinian police watched from a distance. \"If they have a gun, I say: 'Go and shoot'. I can't risk a fight between my soldiers and him,\" said Majdi, a police lieutenant who would give only his first name.</p> <p>\"Yesterday, we tried to stop them but they turned against us.\" He pointed to the charred remains of a police car and a command post. \"Look what they did to us yesterday.\"</p>",
  "The nurse holds the x-ray up to the light, and the bullet that lodged in Mohammed Abu Faress's chest comes into focus, along with bright shards of shattered bone. \"A few inches either way and he would have been dead,\" says Ahmed al-Jabali. Amid the chaos of battle, doctors at Gaza's Shifa hospital detected a disturbing pattern in the injuries inflicted by Israeli soldiers. They are targetting the head and upper body. <p>Shifa has received 11 dead and treated 284 wounded since the fighting erupted on Saturday. The majority had been shot in the upper body, with rubber bullets as well as live rounds, and 20% of patients had been hit in the head. </p> <p>\"Yesterday, a case came in without a brain,\" said a plastic surgeon at Shifa, who has trained and worked abroad. \"Even in London, in Romania, and in Yugoslavia, I never saw anything like it.\" </p> <p>The charge on every Palestinian doctor's lips is that Israeli soldiers are firing to exact maximum damage, leaving injuries far deadlier than those inflicted in previous conflicts. </p> <p>\"In this time, there is a change of method, and I would like to say that the Israelis are trying very much to kill very many people,\" said Dr Mohawia Hassanen, head of emergency services. Doctors at the Mukassad hospital in east Jerusalem noted a similar pattern. </p> <p>A survey of Palestinian hospitals conducted by the local chapter of Physicians for Human Rights found 30% of injuries were from the stomach up, and that there was a disproportionate number of eye injuries. Doctors at St John's hospital in Jerusalem have treated 18 Palestinians shot in the eye. </p> <p><b> Devastating</b><br> </p> <p> The use of rockets and helicopter gunships has had a devastating effect. On Sunday, Mohammed Abu Faress went down to Netzarim junction with four of his friends to throw stones at the Israeli post there. All four were injured by live rounds. \"I was lying on the ground, and the helicopter was flying and shooting,\" he said. He received two bullet wounds. </p> <p>Down the hall, the aged parents of Zaher Ismail, 17, are exhausted after sitting by his bed all night. He took two bullets below his heart on Tuesday, fired, he believes, by Israeli soldier from the concrete and steel bunker at Netzarim junction. \"It hurts so much,\" he mumbles. To distract him, an orderly shows him a single red rose, and a pamphlet left by a Palestinian party praising his courage. Zaher's enraged father snatches up the flower and crushes it in his hand. </p> <p>\"Many people were shot with M-16, high velocity bullets that shatter on impact,\" Wahib Dajani, a doctor at Mukassad hospital in east Jerusalem told reporters. \"This is a weapon you use armed soldier to armed soldier, world war three, but not against civilians.\" </p> <p>The Israeli army insists it is behaving \"according to our rules and our morals\". It is to meet fire with fire. \"We want to be very clear: we react when they open fire on one of our people and on our position, but we are not firing on specific parts of the body. We return fire to the source of the fire,\" said Major Olivier Rafowicz. </p> <p>The Israeli rules of engagement for low-intensity conflict - more than for a riot, but less than all-out war - license soldiers to fight rocks and petrol bombs with tear gas and rubber bullets. But when troops come under fire from Kalashnikovs, as they have from Palestinian police at Netzarim, then they are authorised to return fire with live ammunition. </p> <p>\"We are aware of propaganda from the Palestinian side to demonise us, but we are behaving according to our rules and our morals,\" Major Rafowicz said. </p> <p>But international outrage at Israel's tactics is growing. Stunned by the image of a cowering 12-year-old boy, Mohammed al-Direh, who was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in Gaza at the weekend, international human rights organisations are demanding investigations into Israel's methods of containing civil unrest. </p> <p>At least 49 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,800 injured during the last week, the Palestinian health ministry said yesterday. Thirteen were children; the youngest, a girl, was less than two years old. Yesterday, Human Rights Watch joined Amnesty International in expressing grave concern at the high casualty toll and the killing of children and medics. The International Committee of the Red Cross has made a rare written protest against the death of an ambulance driver in Gaza at the weekend, who was shot dead when he was coming to the al-Direhs' aid. Israeli human rights groups are conducting their own investigations. </p> <p><b> Improper use</b><br> </p> <p> The Israeli government was again criticised at the United Nations on Tuesday, and during yesterday's meeting in Paris, where the prime minister, Ehud Barak, is fighting off French and Palestinian calls for an international inquiry. </p> <p>Even local human rights groups are accusing Israel of improper use of rubber-jacketed bullets, which are designed to be shot at the legs and lower body from distances of more than 20 yards. </p> <p>There have been many documented instances of close-range shootings at eye level. \"What is happening in these few days is that the Israelis are shooting at our people and our children, not with the aim of injuring, but for killing,\" said Dr Hassanen.</p>",
  "With a few exceptions, the Israelis contend that the bloody tumult in Israel and the occupied territory has been instigated and stage-managed by Yasser Arafat in order to strengthen his hand in the faltering peace process. <p>This is not taken seriously by western leaders such as President Jacques Chirac, who put the blame squarely on the far-right politician General Ariel Sharon, whose visit to Haram al-Sharif last week he described as an \"irresponsible provocation\". Even Madeleine Albright, the secretary of state from a US administration that rarely criticises Israel, called it \"definitely counter-productive.\" </p> <p>Historically, nothing has aroused Palestinian emotions like slights to Jerusalem's holy places. Yet while Mr Sharon provoked the eruption, the fury underlying it had been building for years; nothing shows that more clearly than the participation of Israel's Arab citizens. Mr Arafat had nothing to do with that, it is rooted in the discrimination they face. </p> <p>But this does not mean that Mr Arafat misses any opportunity to turn such upheavals to his own diplomatic ends. Ever since the 1993 Oslo agreement, his negotiating position has been very weak, dependent as it is on a balance of power weighted in Israel's favour. </p> <p>One means of pressure available to Mr Arafat is the crisis diplomacy he engages in from time to time, his displays of inflexibility in the face of deadlines of the kind now threatening the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, with the collapse of his government. His other is \"confrontation\" on the ground. </p> <p>\"Confrontations\", especially if they are spontaneous, give Israelis a foretaste of what they might face should the peace process break down altogether, and galvanise the Americans into fresh endeavours to rescue it - these alter the power balance a little in the Palestinians' favour. After all, it was the six-year Intifada that produced Oslo. </p> <p>But given the disparity in power, the gravity of confrontations is measured in Palestinian dead. So far this time it is 61. </p> <p>Mr Arafat needed new diplomatic clout. Mr Sharon's gesture came in handy. It is said that members of his own organisation, Fatah, rather than Hamas militants, are playing a key role in the fighting. That is not surprising. For this is a make-or-break time in his own career as well as the peace process. </p> <p>The two sides have been grappling over \"final status\" issues; the signs are that they were getting pretty close to agreement. If so, that was because, in any true reckoning, it is Mr Arafat who has given the most away. </p> <p>The scale of this outbreak can be seen as a product of the fact that a final peace agreement is so very close. At least it can if Mr Arafat is still truly in control of events. </p> <p>When calm is restored, Mr Arafat will - or so he imagines - enter the last phase of negotiations from a position of greater strength. He will also, thanks to Mr Sharon's blunder and Israel's subsequent military excesses, have won back US favour. </p> <p>But that is the optimistic scenario. The other, perhaps more realistic one, is that Mr Arafat is less and less in control, and is riding a wave of growing disillusionment with the peace process. If he doesn't deliver an agreement which his people can accept soon, the logic of confrontation will develop . </p> <p>The very idea that Palestinians should get their way by force is anathema to Israel. The firepower it is now deploying shows the lengths to which it will go to retain its mastery. </p> <p>For Palestinians, the death of the peace process would mean one of two things - a return to subjugation or to resistance of the kind that Mr Arafat himself once led.</p>",
  "The political crisis rocking Yugoslavia was approaching a pivotal moment last night after thousands of opposition supporters pushed aside police trying to detain striking miners. <p>The confrontation at the Kolubara mine, 30 miles south of Belgrade, was sparked by Slobodan Milosevic 's attempts to regain control of a country paralysed by protests. It rebounded when hundreds of police abandoned their posts. </p> <p>The failure to arrest the miners' leaders convinced the opposition that the president's grasp on the levers of state power was slipping. Buoyed by their victory, the opposition issued a fresh ultimatum calling on Mr Milosevic to recognise the will of people by 3pm today and publish the \"real results\" of the election. </p> <p>It also urged people from all over the country to rally at the Yugoslav parliament building in Belgrade to show the extent of public opposition to what it described as \"massive election fraud\". </p> <p>In an open letter to Mr Milosevic, Mr Kostunica last night warned that the country could plunge into armed clashes if he did not step down. \"We are faced with the danger of open clashes in Serbia,\" he said. \"We cannot accept any second round election because this would make us accomplices in the stealing of the first round votes.\" </p> <p>Last night the federal constitutional court, responding to a chorus of opposition complaints, annulled \"part\" of the first round of the elections. </p> <p>The Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug did not make it clear which part of the vote had been annulled, whether it would affect the overall result or if it would require a recount. </p> <p>When news spread of a police raid on the giant Kolubara mine yesterday, a column of protesters sped there. A cordon of 30-40 regular police stood on a side road leading to the mine but after only one brief clash, officers gave way. </p> <p>A bus carrying demonstrators from the opposition stronghold of Cacak shoved aside a police van and burst through the cordons into the strip mine complex. </p> <p>The police lacked their usual determination. \"Wait, slow, down, don't be nervous,\" one officer said. \"Why should blood be spilled for nothing?\" </p> <p>After a further standoff, people simply flooded round the cordon. Police did not try to stop them. As sunset approached, the officers appeared to give up, withdrew from barricades and mingled with strikers inside the occupied compound. </p> <p>\"The battle for Serbia was won here,\" cried one jubilant opposition leader, Dragan Kovacevic. </p> <p>\"Kolubara is our Gdansk\" said Professor Srbijanka Turajlic, an opposition supporter, referring to the shipyard strikes in the 1980s which sounded the death knell of communism in Poland. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica, who claims outright victory in the September 24 presidential poll, raced to the mine to be greeted by tumultuous applause from an estimated 10,000 people. </p> <p>\"Is there anything more honest than the miners rising to defend their votes?\" he told the cheering crowds. \"We agreed to everything and we took part in elections under their rules. We won honestly ... Milosevic's people do not respect the constitution they had written themselves. Serbia has risen so that one man would leave.\" </p> <p>In an earlier interview, shown on Channel 4 News, Mr Kostunica appeared confident that Mr Milosevic's powerbase was crumbling. \"There are more and more signs that they [the army and police] are not going to follow Milosevic and his political party. </p> <p>\"The protests will go on. The most important base is the will of the people, their votes, their energy, their enthusiasm. Milosevic will be the last one to realise that he has lost this altogether.\" </p> <p>The police action came after the state prosecutor named 11 strike leaders and two opposition politicians as suspects who should be detained \"on suspicion of sabotage\". </p> <p>Millions in Serbia have joined the campaign of civil disobedience to force Mr Milosevic to concede that he lost the election. Few believed he would move against the miners, because the miners have the backing of the community. </p> <p>The coal strike is the most serious stoppage so far in this week's campaign of civil disobedience. On Tuesday, the government threatened \"special measures\" against leaders of strikes and road blockades. </p> <p>Among those joining the demonstrations was the Yugoslav soccer star, Savo Milosevic, formerly of Aston Villa.\"I came here to participate in this action, the fact that I am here speaks volumes on what I think,\" he said. </p> <p>A further sign of the president's weakening hold on authority came when the main state-run daily newspaper in the northern province of Vojvodina declared that its editorial policy would switch from following the government line to objectivelyreporting on events.</p>",
  "Ann Widdecombe may have just solved the Tories' trickiest conundrum. Until yesterday they could not explain how they would simultaneously spend more money on public services even as they cut taxes. But in Bournemouth the shadow home secretary hit upon a novel way to find the extra cash: she wants to fine one in four adults \u00a3100 for possessing cannabis. One in four may sound huge, but that was the finding of 1998's British Crime Survey: it found 25% of us had tried cannabis at some point, rising to 42% among the under-30s. So Ms Widdecombe's call for a fixed penalty on all those millions may well be a stroke of fiscal genius: an instant money-maker. <p>Judged by any other criterion, however, the proposal is flat-out absurd - as ill-considered as Tony Blair's infamous \"cashpoint\" scheme for late night louts. Now, as then, the condemnation has come from all quarters. Despite Ms Widdecombe's claim to have consulted with them before her conference speech, the police have been unequivocal. The Police Federation said that, with only a limited number of officers available, arresting everyone who uses a tiny amount of dope would divert the force from fighting more serious crimes: burglary or vio lence. Others noted that Operation Widdecombe would leave millions of otherwise law-abiding people with a criminal record, barring them from work as teachers, social workers or carers. As if such a consensus of disapproval outside the Bournemouth centre was not evidence enough of the Conservatives' blunder, the party's former leader in the Lords, Robert Cranborne, joined in. He said \"zero tolerance\" of drugs would make the law into an ass, one that would be broken en masse and without guilt. </p> <p>The noble lord's comments go to the heart of the Tories' problem this week: they keep treading on their own message. Either they send out mixed signals - cuddly tolerance from Michael Portillo, crackdown toughness from Ms Widdecombe - or they argue with each other: first Ken Clarke is warm on Europe, then Margaret Thatcher is characteristically chilly. The result is confusion and loss of credibility: a point emphasised by yesterday's equally muddled call for young workers to save for their own pensions, thereby depriving the state pension fund of \u00a34bn. The Tories' plans may grab headlines, but they lack coherence or even basic logic. To coin a phrase, they lack common sense.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.QXL.com\" target=\"_NEW\">QXL.com</a> slumped to a new low yesterday when it emerged that chairman Jonathan Bulkeley had sold 750,000 shares in the beleaguered online auction company. </p> <p>His selling began on September 28 with the price at 51.5p and was announced yesterday, forcing the shares down 2.5p to 44.25p.

  "The government will announce plans today to ban tobacco advertising and sponsorship as the World Health Organisation piles on the pressure for an official inquiry into smuggling allegations against the tobacco giants. <p>Public health minister Yvette Cooper is to promise legislation to significantly curb cigarette promotion within hours of the European Court of Justice ruling unlawful a Brussels directive intended to achieve the same end. </p> <p>A bill is expected in the Queen's Speech next month to fulfill Labour's manifesto commitment to end advertising, with a fierce debate underway in Whitehall over whether motor racing and snooker should retain controversial three-year extensions. </p> <p>Under a European Union proposal, the two sports could have continued taking tobacco money until 2006 rather than the 2003 deadline for other sectors after lobbying by Downing Street. </p> <p>Labour was forced to return a \u00a31m gift, and turn down a second, after it emerged the money had been donated by Formula One mogul Bernie Ecclestone who stood to gain a small fortune from the extension. </p> <p>Downing Street is believed to be torn between treating the grand prix industry like all other sectors to \"draw a line\" under the Ecclestone affair and sleaze accusations or sticking with the longer period, fearing a shorter timescale could damage the sport. </p> <p>The Commons health select committee supports a tougher line with motor racing. The World Motor Sport Council of the International Automobile Federation last night announced it would impose its own ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship from 2006. </p> <p>The EU directive is expected to be struck out by the court on technical grounds after the commission introduced it under EU single market legislation rather than as a health and safety issue. </p> <p>The commitment to outlaw advertising comes as a senior WHO official urged ministers to investigate evidence that British American Tobacco and other companies have profitted hugely from smuggling. </p> <p>The Commons health committee proposed a Whitehall inquiry earlier this year, but BAT, which set up an internal inquiry after the Guardian published internal documents, is lobbying against an investigation. </p> <p>David Yach, director of the WHO's programmes on non-communicable diseases, said: \"By forcing prices down, large-scale cigarette smuggling is contributing to the growth of smoking in developing countries.\"</p>",
  "Tony Blair flies to Poland today to deliver a speech on the future of Europe which has been billed as an attempt to reassert the authority of the nation state. <p>Mr Blair will propose a new second chamber for the European Union drawn from member states' national parliaments. </p> <p>It would act as a political check on both the European commission and the European parliament. It follows similar proposals for an EU senate from the German foreign secretary, Joschka Fischer and the Czech president, Vaclav Havel. </p> <p>Mr Blair's speech, which takes as its theme the institutional value in restraining trends towards further European integration, has been given extra weight by last week's referendum in which Denmark rejected the euro. </p> <p>The prime minister will not specify the size of the proposed second chamber, but he will say it could oversee areas such as defence, justice and home affairs, which are presently handled inter-governmentally, without direct input from the commission or European parliament. It could also bring national democracies closer to the institutions of the EU. </p> <p>At present, many of the institutions dealing with these policy areas are swamped by large workloads. In the House of Commons, the EU standing committees, established to scrutinise draft legislation from Europe, have no legal status within EU treaties. The European court of justice can take up to five years to rule on whether the commission has overstepped its powers. </p> <p>Overall, Mr Blair hopes the speech will both reassure his domestic audience by proposing a non-federal version of Europe while setting out a credible, positive plan which will influence the thinking of his fellow leaders. </p> <p>Mr Blair had been urged by some advisers to propose a new two-part treaty for Europe clearly setting out the distinctive competences of national governments and the EU. This would to draw a line in the sand against further integration. However, Mr Blair has also been warned that such an idea could be interpreted by Eurosceptics as a constitution for Europe. </p> <p>He will urge his fellow heads of state to take on a greater role in European affairs through the council of ministers, but will not mount a direct attack on the commission, arguing that the process of reform has now begun under its vice-pres ident, Neil Kinnock. Mr Blair is expected to refer to the Danish referendum result as a sign of growing alienation of all European electorates, who regard politicians as remote and unaccountable. </p> <p>He is also considering tabling a call for sunset clauses - deadlines by which proposals floated in Brussels must either to be adopted or dropped altogether. </p> <p>The choice of Warsaw as the venue will also ensure the speech contains a strong call for the EU to expand its borders to the east as swiftly as possible. Mr Blair will argue enlargement would represent a victory for European values of solidarity. </p> <p>He is likely to echo a suggestion by Robin Cook, foreign secretary, that the first wave of applicants, six countries including Poland, should be admitted to the EU by 2005. </p> <p>However, he will reject the idea of enhanced cooperation in which a small cabal of probably wealthier countries could cooperate more closely either inside or outside the EU. He will argue that such a proposal would merely set up a new waiting room for applicant countries.</p>",
  "William Hague was last night left struggling to get his party conference back on his \"ready for government\" message after Ann Widdecombe's latest hardline initiatives against minor drug offences met widespread criticism - even from the police. <p>With the Police Superintendents' Association calling the plans impractical and unenforceable, the Conservative leader was forced to stop polishing his keynote speech, to be delivered in Bournemouth today, in order to defend the shadow home secretary's pro posal for \u00a3100 \"fixed penalty\" fines for possession of cannabis. </p> <p>Although Mr Hague was given advance warning of Miss Widdecombe's plan to tackle the issue of drugs, his aides were furious to learn of the details only in the early editions of yesterday's newspapers. The Tory leader was left with no option but to publicly back her. </p> <p>Last night he found himself on TV being asked whether - in addition to his 14 pints in a day as a teenager - he had ever smoked marijuana, like up to 42% of young people between 16 and 29. \"No, I did not,\" he said. </p> <p>Insisting that US experience has shown what can be achieved, Mr Hague told Channel 4 News: \"We have to take the fight against drugs further down the [supply] chain...we want to talk to the police about how to do it. The police have to fight harder against drugs, not surrender.\" </p> <p>Miss Widdecombe defended her proposals, which would also mean longer sentences for dealers. But she conceded that her policy would need 2,500 extra police and a similar number of extra prison places. </p> <p>Not only did the Widdecombe package come as a surprise to senior colleagues, including the shadow chancel lor, Michael Portillo - whose approval would be needed for the cost of extra police and prisons required - but its tone was at odds with the socially tolerant and inclusive \"one nation\" tone which Hague allies have been striking all week. </p> <p>Buoyed by rising opinion polls and Labour's problems, the Tories have been enjoying what Mr Hague will today call their \"biggest, most upbeat and successful conference for years\" watched by voters who, the Tory leader believes, think he is fit to be prime minister. </p> <p>He plans to open up a \"second front\" - promising that a Hague government would direct much of its energy to im proving the lives of the \"least fortunate\" people on bleak estates in inner cities, the old, poor and those scarred by drugs. </p> <p>He will re-emphasise the inclusive nature of his campaign strategy by seeking to reach beyond the core Conservative vote - those people enthused by his message on tax, crime, asylum and Europe - to \"govern for all hard-working families...for people of every community and background.\" </p> <p>Mr Hague will deride New Labour - \"never a philosophy, it was a fashion, and nothing is more unfashionable than fashion which is out of fashion. We saw them last week, divided, arrogant and out of touch. What a bunch they are, this soap opera of a government.\" </p> <p>He will say voters \"know that not only has Labour failed to deliver, but it's never going to deliver. They want to know what the alternative will be. They look at us, they want to know if we are ready, they want to know if they can trust us.\"</p>",
  "A couple whose only daughter died in a bonfire accident are to launch a court action under the new Human Rights Act to try to choose the sex of a child. <p>Alan and Louise Masterton, from Monifieth, near Dundee, have four sons and want to use IVF and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) to ensure their next child is a girl. </p> <p>Their daughter, Nicole, died last summer at the age of three after a balloon containing flammable gas fell on to a bonfire at their home and exploded. Nicole suffered 90% burns and died two months later. </p> <p>At the moment, embryo sex screening is only available for prospective parents who are carriers of medical conditions related to a particular gender. </p> <p>The Mastertons plan to launch a court case against the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority under two articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantee a fair hearing from public authorities. </p> <p>The couple, speaking at their home yesterday, said they were not trying to replace Nicole or create a designer baby, but had a deep psychological need for a girl in the family. Mrs Masterton, 42, was sterilised after Nicole's birth. </p> <p>\"It is difficult to explain,\" said Mr Masterton. \"We tried for Nicole for 15 years. We were blessed with her and she was a fantastic child. We are looking for the opportunity to try for another daughter, not another Nicole, but to bring a female dimension to our family.\" </p> <p>The couple approached the HFEA in January, asking for the rules governing PGD to be changed for their case and for Louise to be implanted with female-only embryos. </p> <p>The process involves the selective destruction of male embryos and is usually employed for families with a history of hereditary diseases in male children, such as haemophilia or muscular dystrophy. </p> <p>They were told to submit an application through one of the five IVF clinics in the UK. They approached the clinics and were turned down because, they say, the clinics were not prepared to put forward a case that went against HFEA policy. </p> <p>\"What the HFEA are saying is a smokescreen,\" said Mr Masterton. \"They claim to have given permission to the clinics to apply, but they have to change the rule first.\" </p> <p>HFEA spokesman James Yeandel said the authority's policy was that PGD should only be used when there was a risk of serious genetic disorder, but they had been moved by the tragic nature of the case and agreed that a licensing committee could examine it. To do that, they needed an application from the Mastertons through a clinic. \"I don't know what else we can do,\" he said. However, the Bishop of Edinburgh, Richard Holloway, a former HFEA board member, said he hoped the case could be considered. He said the HFEA was responding cautiously because of a deep-rooted public fear over sex selection. </p> <p>\"I think, in this case, it probably ought to look hard at it because, while you could probably make a case for a general regulation that sex selection is a bad thing, there must be exceptional circumstances. I would think this one probably was, and I hope they can get a centre to send in an application to the HFEA.\" </p> <p>But Ken Mason, who teaches medical law and ethics at Edinburgh University, said the Mastertons' case crossed the boundaries of ethically acceptable medical practice. \"You could take this to the point of absurdity - for example, you could say you had five children with red hair and wanted one with black hair. </p> <p>\"It is an absurd example, but nonetheless if you open up the Pandora's box wider and wider, you will eventually get to an absurd situation like that.\" </p> <p>If the case fails, however, the couple could look overseas for help - something they have already considered.</p>",
  "The police last night took the shine off from Ann Widdecombe's conference triumph by making quite clear they could not support her plan for automatic \u00a3100 for anyone possessing even the smallest amount of cannabis. <p>Her promise that a future Conservative government would introduce a zero tolerance for possession of drugs wowed the Tory party's law and order activists who cheered and sang 'Happy Birthday' as William Hague toasted her 53rd birthday with champagne. </p> <p>Miss Widdecombe's plans to give the police the power to order a bloodtest from anybody they suspect has been using drugs has broken a seven year bipartisan approach which targeted police efforts on the most dangerous drugs. </p> <p>The Police Superintendents' Association were the most openly critical: \"We would not support this proposal,\" said their spokesman, Peter Williams. \"The policy is not to punish people for possession of drugs but to try to divert them from drugs.\" The other police organisations representing chief constables and rank and file police officers made clear they had not been consulted before the Conservative plan was finalised. </p> <p>Miss Widdecombe was also implicitly criticised from within her own party. The former Tory leader of the Lords, Lord Cranborne, called for cannabis to be legalised and told the BBC: \"You play into the hands of criminals if you make the law into an ass when nobody wants to obey the law and, indeed, regards breaking the law as a bit of a challenge.\" </p> <p>But such reservations did not trouble the party faithful who rewarded Miss Widdecombe's proposed drugs clampdown and pledges to detain all asylum seekers and make prisoners work a full day with the kind of reception that they use to reserve for \"hanging and flogging\" home secretaries. </p> <p>She made clear her new drugs policy came straight from the policy book of the New York Republican, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani: \"Although we can't replicate exactly what I saw in New York, we can learn the lessons of tackling crime head on and not conceding a centimetre to the criminals. So today, I can announce a new policy. A policy that means no quarter for those who trade is dealing in human misery, despair and even death.\" </p> <p>She made clear that a first time offender - schoolchildren included - would face a minimum fixed penalty - not an on-the-spot fine - of at least \u00a3100. Second time offenders would be taken straight to court for heavier punishment. </p> <p>Miss Widdecombe also confirmed Tory plans to put all new asylum seekers into detention camps and promised \"we will automatically house all new applicants in secure reception centres.\" </p> <p>She added: \"It's extraordinary, but Labour call that racist. Yet the biggest loser in the system is the genuine refugee who comes to this country with not only a legal but a moral case for a safe haven, and finds himself clogged up in a queue which has hit more than 100,000 cases - double what Labour inherited.\" </p> <p>Real refugees, under her plan, would be given access to education for their children, and language and social services support.</p>",
  "<p>Stephen Fry is quite clear about what he is. It's there in the first line of his entry in Who's Who: \"writer, actor, comedian\". That probably reverses the public perception of Fry, whose blustering generals and bloodthirsty monarchs have made him television's favourite barmy buffer. But writing is not a sideline: he is a proper writer, not a celebrity with a word processor. </p> <p>The Stars' Tennis Balls (hideous title but a pertinent quote from The Duchess of Malfi), which is published today, is his fourth novel. Add his well-received memoir, Moab Is My Washpot, and Paperweight, a 470-page collection of his journalism, and he has something resembling an oeuvre. To have produced such a volume of work at the age of 43 is impressive enough; to have done it while appearing in films and on TV, as well as developing a curious role as linchpin of British national life (his close friends number everyone from Prince Charles to Peter Mandelson), is extraordinary. </p> <p>I was watching a banal TV biog of Sir John Mills the other day, and who should pop up giving his pennyworth but Fry, separated from \"Johnny\" by 50 years but still apparently a close chum. Fry is a fixture on such programmes, just as he is a regular - always polished and funny - on chat shows. He is one of those clever people who uses ubiquity to ensure that you never find out anything about them. </p> <p>As his output would suggest, Fry is stupendously well organised. He has his laptop (he is crazy about software) and a constantly ringing mobile that plays The Ride of the Valkyries (he is crazy about Wagner). He also has a cold, but he's a trouper and can still apostrophise through the sneezes and wheezes. A Fry soliloquy is something to behold, words, ideas and quotations tumbling out in torrents. The third playing of The Ride of the Valkyries prompts me to ask him about Wagner and, in turn, music. He becomes animated and I am engulfed. </p> <p>\"I am a very emotional person, and music was the thing that always made it gush out. Music has a particular access to one's emotional self that is at a far deeper level than any other art form. Eliot said it was the deepest of the arts and deep beneath the arts, and that seems to be true. I suppose it's because it's abstract, it's not about anything, so it's not mediated or palliated by the dirt of actual reference. A word is more or less a token - poets are always struggling with the words they're having to use. I think it was Rilke who said that 'language is the universal whore that I must make into a virgin'. Musicians don't have to do that: they don't have to use language, the diminished currency of everyone. Because music isn't about anything, it can be about everything.\" </p> <p>When Fry was on remand for credit card fraud as a teenager (you surely know all that stuff from chat shows and the memoir), his fellow inmates called him \"the professor\". His alter ego on Radio 4's Loose Ends was Dr Donald Trefusis, Carnegie professor of philology at Cambridge. In his journalism (mainly columns he wrote for the Listener and the Daily Telegraph), he uses the word \"banausian\" with a remarkable, indeed tiresome, frequency. You get the point: he is a crazy prof, in fact and fiction. </p> <p>The new novel, a reworking of The Count of Monte Cristo (readers will be invited to spot the similarities), falls into the category of good read rather than great book, pacy, well constructed and rather gruesome. If one were to make a criticism, one might say that it was a trifle banausian. It works like clockwork, but one does not buy a novel to tell the time. </p> <p>When celebrities write novels, it is often the celebrity that gets reviewed rather than the novel. Should he perhaps publish them pseudonymously, as Don Trefusis, say? \"It is the dearest dream of one's bosom for it to be reviewed as a novel, not a Stephen Fry novel, but you can't keep it a secret, and then it looks like a form of vanity. I do receive letters from people who are only dimly aware that I've popped my face on the screen, particularly from abroad. In the US and Germany they have no sense of me as a person. </p> <p>\"I've got less self-conscious about it. I used to feel incredibly embarrassed if I went to a dinner party and there was a 'real' novelist there. I would think they had every reason to think 'I saw your window display in Waterstone's, you bastard, while my literary masterpiece sits on the back table'. Now I have to accept the fact that I can never be quite sure why people read the books.\" </p> <p>Might the writing, as the Who's Who hierarchy suggests, displace the acting? \"I cordon off some time to write a book, so I take on nothing at all for these months. I just cannot write and act at the same time. I can't be halfway through a chapter and then go off and act. I have to become completely lost in it. But to be only a writer would drive me mad. I'm a pretty social animal a lot of the time and writing is such an isolated business that if that was my only work I don't know how I'd cope. Similarly, if I was just an actor I don't know how I'd cope with never having any control.\" </p> <p>We meet at one of Fry's favourite haunts, the Groucho club in Soho. I notice that he often conducts interviews here, always upstairs in a red room that induces narcolepsy. It is another example of Mr Ubiquity adroitly protecting his privacy: no chance of getting near the Norfolk rectory in which he lives with his newish partner, about whom very little is known other than that he is 10 years younger than Fry, doesn't work in showbusiness and is said to have made Fry blissfully happy. </p> <p>Fry once said that he had spent the first 15 years of his professional life defining himself by his work but had succeeded only in making himself unhappy. He was lonely; he had made the peculiar statement that he was \"90% gay\"; he had proclaimed his celibacy; in 1995 he fled a production of Simon Gray's Cell Mates that had been critically panned; he disappeared; he considered suicide (he had made a serious attempt in his screwed-up teenage years); he was admitted briefly to a psychiatric hospital; he moved to New York and stayed in the US for a year. </p> <p>Finding a partner had, reputedly, made a big difference. When I asked him about his new-found happiness, he laughed loudly. \"Oh, blimey, I don't want to overdo it either way really. It's not that I was profoundly and hopelessly miserable before. I had that well-publicised wobble in 1995, and it's certainly true that since then I've felt more cheerful. My friends tell me I'm more relaxed, and it makes me wonder whether I was really such a miserable sod before. It's not like some religious conversion in the sense that I go round skipping, but nor is that to underestimate the pleasure to be had by having the sort of relationship with someone that one hasn't had before.\" </p> <p>So why keep this perfect partner under wraps? \"It's a tricky one to play: if you keep it very secret, some paparazzo will be all the keener, so we go out together, we were in the Ivy the other night, we go to film premieres together, he doesn't duck round side entrances. But he prefers not to be photographed - he's not in the business and I don't see why he needs to be in the press. I'm glad about that. It would be a little odd to have a partner who revelled in the spotlight. I have to say the press have been fine about it; they haven't hunted us down.\" </p> <p>The Ivy, film premieres, Fry's social whirl. How did he get sucked into that? \"I haven't cultivated it. Before I had a partner, I was a very useful spare man for dinner parties. I was quite aware that people occasionally like a court jester. I never had a problem with that. The director-general of the BBC would be arranging his party for Wimbledon and might say 'we'll have someone merry - I know, Stephen Fry'. Along the way one meets interesting people. I am fascinated by people and to some extent I am a snob, in what I think is the amiable sense of the word, in that I am capable of being amused and slightly glamorised by people whose lives are slightly different because they are from a long line of dukes or because they control 700 companies.\" </p> <p>Is the professor, the philologist, the man who quotes Rilke happy to play the jester? \"I can be a chameleon. I enjoy it and I don't think I am necessarily being hypocritical about it. I do have lots of different circles. I have lots of friends with whom I play snooker up here: the kind of people who come to the Groucho club but also like to play snooker, lads to some extent. I like going to football matches and have a season ticket at Norwich. I also have gay friends who haven't the faintest interest in snooker or poker or football, and I can sit round a table with them talking about the sort of things they talk about. There are different sides to me, and I am more comfortable now with those multiple personas.\" </p> <p>Fry is an odd mixture of high Tory and low radical: it's just the middle class he can't stand. He plays establishment figures wonderfully because, with his posh country/public school/Cambridge background, he is one. He is attached to old England and in love with English eccentricity; but he despises the pettiness, materialism and xenophobia of modern Conservatism. </p> <p>A question about his alleged \"cocaine problem\" produces another torrent, this time political. \"It wasn't a problem; it was far from a problem; it was perfectly enjoyable. But one has to be very careful what you say on these matters because people are so greasy and sanctimonious and Daily Maily about it. For some reason they decide that if you're in the public eye it's your job to be a role model, and if you say anything other than that it's the most wicked and appalling thing and it caused me nothing but misery and heartache and I vomited every night and my nose exploded with blood, you are vilified. </p> <p> 'There's a name for my pain - the Daily Mail. It symbolises bourgeois fear: fear of outsiders, fear of anything different. Someone should write a book about how uniquely wrong about everything the Daily Mail has always been. It typifies everything that is most shaming about this country in terms of its lurches towards xenophobia and fear: everything in the name of the family, that horrible capital F for family. It's become what the state was for a Stalinist: everything that is done in the name of the family is acceptable.\" </p> <p>Fry wrote a column in the Daily Telegraph in 1997 explaining why he would be voting Labour and describing himself as an \"apostate to his caste\". It is a clue to his chameleon-like character - the Tory radical, the traditionalist who wants to nuke the nuclear family, the populist intellectual, the secretive socialite. </p> <p>\"Trying to square opposites is what so much of one's life is about. From teenage onwards I have always had a double pull. One wants desperately to belong, but on the other hand one yearns to be outside and revels in the things that make one different. I suppose that's particularly true if you grow up at the time that I did and know that you are not as other girls. That gives you a distinctness.\" </p> <p>With that The Ride of the Valkyries erupts again, and it is time for Fry to fly, having once more escaped being pinned to a rock. </p> <p>\u0095 The Stars' Tennis Balls is published today by Hutchinson (\u00a316.99).</p>",

  "The gap between the best and worst performing schools is still far too wide, educationalists from Britain and America will be warned today by school standards minister Estelle Morris. <p>Speaking at a conference in Washington, Ms Morris will highlight rural schools in Britain as having some of the most serious weaknesses, undermining the public perception that poverty and poor academic standards are most closely linked with inner-cities. Of the 530 secondary schools in England identified as those in need of the most help, more than half are in rural areas, she will tell US educationalists, policy makers and teachers. </p> <p>On the eve of the three-day bilateral conference which is seen as the first significant step in forging closer education links between the UK and the USA, Ms Morris said: \"We cannot accept that some children are likely to fail because of their background or the school they go to. </p> <p>\"Whatever school a child goes to, there must be the opportunity to achieve - we cannot allow exclusion from society because of failure of the education system. There is currently too big a gap between the best and worst per forming schools. We need to bring all schools up to the level of the best.\" </p> <p>She claimed that although the gap was now closing - as shown by national test results for 11-year olds - it was still \"far too wide\". Education Action Zones - which are educational test beds attracting extra cash from the public and private sectors - covered two rural areas in Gloucestershire and Somerset - but rural schools needed more innovative solutions, she said. </p> <p>As part of the new transatlantic collaboration, Ms Morris also announced that fifty places on a teachers' international exchange programme would be earmarked for senior teachers in England so they will be able to visit US schools working in similar challenging circumstances. </p> <p>Headteachers from schools in England which have been turned around are among the delegates at the conference, which was announced in June by the US secretary of state, Richard Riley, during a visit to the UK. </p> <p>The US is particularly interested in the literacy and the numeracy strategies used in the UK, which were introduced by the Blair government, and in more rigorous target-setting and performance benchmarking which are now established, if controversial, features of the British education system.</p>",

  "Rosie Douglas, who has died aged 58, became prime minister of the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica only eight months ago, having spent much of his political life travelling the world in support of liberation struggles, the black diaspora and African unity. And it was that international dimension which defined him, a perspective forged during his student days in Canada, where he was jailed following the smashing of a university computer during \"black power\" protests. <p>In a sense, Douglas came to power a generation too late, for he represented the now lost spirit of 1970s Caribbean radical movements. Yet Dominicans who celebrated Douglas's electoral win last January felt that he could somehow re-invent that legacy. They also hoped - as did Douglas himself - that his international connections would bring benefits to his banana-dependent island. </p> <p>His background was not typical of Caribbean leaders of his generation. He was neither from the light-skinned elite nor the landless poor. His father had been a rich landowner, albeit from humble beginnings, who had made his money in Curacao'soil fields. The Douglas coconut estate was large and bountiful, in the north of the island, close to the second town, Portsmouth. </p> <p>The second eldest of 16 children, Rosie was christened Roosevelt (there were other brothers named Eisenhower and Adenauer). He went to school in the capital, Roseau, before applying to study at university in Canada. Impatient of the long wait to receive a visa, he rang up the office of the Canadian prime minister, John Diefenbaker. The story goes that Diefenbaker was so impressed that he invited Douglas to meet him. So it was that Douglas's first political act in the dominion was to join the Canadian Young Conservatives. </p> <p>But then everything changed. Douglas experienced racism. His education in Roseau had been colonial; he had been privileged. In Canada, he heard Martin Luther King speak and met black power leaders such as Stokeley Carmichael - who campaigned for Douglas in the 1990 Dominica election. Meanwhile Douglas studied agriculture at Ontario Agricultural College, and political science and economy at Sir George Williams University, Montreal. </p> <p>Then, in 1969, by then a McGill University post-graduate, he led an anti-racism sit-in at Sir George Williams which led to the occupation of the computer centre and its destruction when police broke up the protest. Charged with arson, Douglas served 18 months in prison. When he was released, to be deported, as he would tell, in handcuffs and leg-irons, he said he would only return as \"prime minister of my own country\". </p> <p>Back in Dominica, he began to develop that balancing act of participation both in domestic politics and on the wider, grander stage that characterised the rest of his life. He formed the short-lived Political Independence Committee, before becoming a senator during a turbulent period after independence in 1978. But he was sacked for inviting Cuban troops to Dominica after the devastations of Hurricane David in 1979; the United States had demanded the action in return for relief aid. </p> <p>Douglas had begun to build on his old student contacts. He secured scholarships for Dominicans to Cuba and the Soviet Union. He made links with Colonel Gaddafi, and the Libyan leader's Little Green Book began to appear in Dominica, much to the alarm of rightwingers. Douglas saw Gaddafi as being able to offer financial support to liberation movements and became a key figure in the somewhat ill-defined Mataba, a Tripoli-based organisation, which offered aid, training and education to Africans. </p> <p>Restless in his small island, Douglas went trouble-shooting in the interests of the Caribbean and the black diaspora. Active in the Socialist International, he also attended Sinn Fein's annual conference for many years. Despite his Libyan connections, he was close to the British Labour party - he was at its annual conference last week and the late Bernie Grant, the Labour MP, was a close friend. </p> <p>Douglas became an MP in 1985, but he only became leader of the Dominica Labour party in 1992, after the death of his brother, Michael. His party lost the 1995 election and there was the feeling that his absences - his critics said he was always \"up in the air\" - diverted his energies. Nevertheless, this year, in January's election, he became prime minister in a coalition administration. At the opening of the new parliament, the guest list included Martin Luther King III. It was a glittering reflection of Douglas's long years in the service of black solidarity. Dominica had never seen anything like it. </p> <p>Desperate to attract investors, he encouraged an enterprise culture and was keen to develop closer relations with the neighbouring French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, and thus with Europe. His oratory was inspiring, yet some felt disheartened by his inability to plan and pay attention to domestic details. Others were also disappointed at his pro-Japan line on whaling. </p> <p>He remained close to the people. Unstuffy, speaking in Creole, patient and big-hearted, he would hear their troubles at any time at his two-storey red and white painted house in the middle of Portsmouth. He was proud, he said, to live \"in the ghetto\". And in the mornings, he jogged with the town youth or played basketball, while the official car sent to take him to his office had to wait. Yet to stay at home was not his way; only by globe-trotting, he said, would business come to Dominica. </p> <p>He is survived by his mother Bernadette, three sons, Tiyani, Cabral and Kim, and one daughter, Deborah. </p> <p>\u0095 Roosevelt (Rosie) Bertrand Douglas, politician, born October 15 1941; died October 1 2000</p>",
  "<p>Private healthcare group Bupa could be forced to split into two as a condition of its \u00a3260m takeover of Community Hospitals, according to a list of options published by the competition commission yesterday. </p> <p>In the first stage of its investigation into the proposed acquisition, the commission held out the possibility of ordering Bupa to separate its insurance arm from its medical facilities businesses - which includes doctors' surgeries, hospitals and nursing homes. </p> <p>The measure was the most severe suggestion on the list, which also included strengthening the arms' length relationship between the two divisions, or ordering Bupa to sell a number of hospitals. </p> <p>Bupa announced in April that it wanted to buy the 21-strong Community Hospitals network, to expand its own chain of 36 hospitals. Trade secretary Stephen Byers ordered an inquiry into the deal in June, following intensive lobbying by the Consumers' Association and the British Medical Association. </p> <p>If the transaction goes ahead, Bupa will control one in four of Britain's private hospitals. Critics fear that the organisation could block access to patients from other healthcare insurers or charge higher rates to non-Bupa members. </p> <p>A Bupa spokeswoman brushed aside the commission's statement yesterday, saying that it was a \"blue-sky list of hypothetical options\". </p> <p>She said: \"We have made it clear that we will co-operate fully with the investigation.\" </p> <p>Bupa insists that it maintains strict \"Chinese walls\" between its insurance arm and its facilities, and says there is no question of discriminating against patients from other insurers. The group sees the acquisition of Community Hospitals as central to its strategy and is keen to proceed if it can find a way of satisfying regulators. </p> <p>By owning more hospitals, Bupa believes it can make savings through economies of scale, as well as guaranteeing the quality of healthcare provided to its members. The group says competition concerns were dealt with fully last year in a report by the office of fair trading into the healthcare sector. </p> <p>Bupa already owns 27% of Community Hospitals. </p> <p>In its submission to the OFT objecting to the deal, the BMA said Bupa was acting with \"the sole intention of reducing overall capacity in order that Bupa hospitals can subsequently increase their charges.\"</p>",
  "<p>Telewest, which has been laid low by a series of mishaps over the past few months, was hoping for a reversal of fortunes yesterday when it named Bob Fuller as chief executive of its cable division. </p> <p>Mr Fuller, 53, joins from mobile phone company Orange where he had been chief operating officer since 1997. He had been employed by the Hutchison Group, the Hong Kong conglomerate which started Orange, for 18 years. </p> <p>Adam Singer, Telewest group chief executive said: \"It is a serious coup for Telewest to have got its hands on top-flight talent and experience like Bob's.

  "A former NHS nurse's legal challenge to entitle her transsexual \"husband\" to benefit from her pension if she dies was yesterday referred to the European court of justice by the court of appeal. <p>The nurse, who cannot be named, contends that the NHS pension scheme discriminates against her and her partner, who was born a woman, on grounds of sex. She also argues that the denial of a survivor's pension breaches the European convention on human rights, incorporated into UK law this week. </p> <p>Since same-sex partners cannot legally marry, and transsexuals cannot marry someone of their own birth sex, both groups are excluded by rules that reserve survivors' pensions for married partners. </p> <p>The court ordered anonymity for the nurse, who sat at the back of the courtroom without her partner. The pair, both in their 40s, live in the west country. They went through an adapted Church of England marriage ceremony conducted by a minister with the approval of a bishop who knew of their case. </p> <p>Laura Cox QC, representing the nurse, told Lords Justices Aldous, Brooke and Sedley that the case had been referred to them by the employment appeal tribunal because of the \"fundamental human rights\" elements. \"This court must rule on the extent to which the respondent [Alan Milburn, the health secretary] violates European convention rights.\" </p> <p>The Human Rights Act, which came into force on Monday, incorporates the European convention on human rights into English law, making it enforceable in the English courts. </p> <p>Ms Cox said her client, a nurse and care manager for 20 years, was backed by the pressure group Justice and the equal opportunities commission, which believed the refusal to allow her partner a survivor's pension was direct discrimination. </p> <p>The employment appeal tribunal had held that they were barred from ruling in the nurse's favour by an earlier judgment denying travel benefits to the same sex partner of a railway worker. </p> <p>Like same-sex partners, the nurse and her partner are unable to overcome their problem by marrying. The government is considering a change in the law, but at present legal sex is fixed at birth and the nurse's partner is considered legally female. </p> <p>Ms Cox said the partner \"lives as a man, presents as a man and to all intents and purposes the couple present to the world as man and wife\". </p> <p>She said 5,000 people in the UK were recognised as transsexuals, a recognised medical condition called gender dysphoria which can be treated by altering the body with drugs and operations. </p> <p>He had gone through a \"lengthy and painful process of treatment and operations\" to be able to live in his true gender identity. The pair were not same sex partners but a man and woman in a heterosexual relationship. </p> <p>\"The European court of human rights has expressly acknowledged how serious are the problems caused to transsexuals by the continued refusal of the UK government to allow them to amend their birth certificates, to acknowledge their true gender and permit them to get married,\" Ms Cox said. </p> <p>Lord Justice Aldous commented during the case: \"In reality this person is a man.\" </p> <p>The case will come back to the appeal court once the Luxembourg court has ruled on the questions of European law.</p>",

  "Seumas Milne's reference to hauliers rampaging through miners' picket lines stirred many memories (What Stella left out, October 2). While many know of the misuses of the law in the course of the strike, how many are aware of the ongoing hardship suffered by men still victimised? Over 40 men are so effectively blacklisted that they have never been able to work after 15 years. In addition, there are many men who lost several years of employment because of the bloody-minded attitude of the Coal Board and the Tory government. Many of these men were convicted as a result of the dirty tricks campaign referred to by Milne. We had hoped to see some significant changes under a Labour government but so far there has been very little movement. <p>All we now ask for is these men to be given pension credits for their lost years. This money would not come from the Exchequer but from the miners pension scheme. That there are sufficient funds to meet this is shown by the fact that this government has, in the past three years, taken out of the fund \u00a3250m in \"actuarial surpluses\". In May, the DTI issued a 17-page consultation document on this issue but to date there has been no real movement.

  "<p>One of cinema's greatest tale-tellers, it's easy to imagine that spaghetti western maestro Sergio Leone would have been a hoot when it came to inventing bedtime stories. In fact, though, when someone happened to find the director sending one of his girls to the land of nod while making For A Few Dollars More, they didn't hear him intoning a story, but words of fiscal wisdom. </p> <p>\"The first thing to learn\", Sergio told the kid, \"is never put a cent of your own money into a picture.\" It's advice that Dwight Yoakam may soon wish someone had given him at a formative age. Because the country singer recently sold his $825,000 Malibu home to help finance the movie South Of Heaven, West Of Hell, which he wrote, directed and stars in alongside Billy Bob Thornton, Vince Vaughn and Bridget Fonda. The movie, Yoakam's debut stab at directing, finds him playing a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, and was apparently inspired by Westerns like One-Eyed Jacks and Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid - neither of which, it has to be said, exactly set box-office cash tills ringing when they were originally released. </p> <p>And Yoakam isn't the first person to fund a movie out of his own pocket. </p> <p>Indeed, unless they already have some development deal it's customary for producers to pay seed money for scripts, location-scouting and a lot of expensive lunches in the hope that this will impress the money men enough to sign on the dotted line. When Untouchables producer Art Linson was trying to persuade Universal to pony up for his Hunter S Thompson adaptation Where The Buffalo Roam, for example, he paid for the notorious gonzo journalist to stay in a pricey LA hotel. It was a decision that soon began to melt his Amex card, as Linson recalls in his autobiography A Pound Of Flesh: \"The first thing I noticed in the room was a gashing four-inch hole in the wall by the side of a picture above the couch. 'What's with the hole?' I shouted through to the bedroom where [Thompson] had gone to change. 'It was an accident.' He reappeared holding a gun. 'This wasn't supposed to carry past 15 feet.' He walked off seven paces from the wall, turned, and fired. Another gaping hole blasted through the wallpaper. 'Christ', he said, 'these specifications can't be trusted.' My hand instinctively reached for my wallet.\" </p> <p>Of course, helping to finance a film can also enable film-makers to keep control of their movies. A theory most recently proven by James Cameron, who initially agreed to waive his titanic Titanic fee when it looked like the ship was about to go down with a brace of movie companies on deck. </p> <p>\"Yeah, that definitely shows the advantages of putting in our own money,\" agrees British producer Gregor Truter, who's just completed his debut movie Lava. \"Because once it stops being one man's vision, that becomes a very dangerous situation. Once it becomes filming by committee you're in all sorts of trouble. I mean, I didn't like Titanic, but it is Cameron's vision. Funnily enough I saw it with Leslie Grantham, who's in Lava, and if he doesn't like a film he just starts talking. With about 20 minutes to go Leslie was going, 'Oh dear, oh fucking dear. Go on, hurry up and fucking drown.'\" </p> <p>The downside to this strategy is that if the film fails at the box office then the director stands to lose far more than just their reputation. It was just such a scenario that confronted Francis Ford Coppola during the production of Apocalypse Now - a film whose spiralling budget United Artists only agreed to finance as long as he put up pretty much everything he owned as collateral. While the film would show a profit, the pressures inherent in taking this risk are more than apparent in Apocalypse's accompanying documentary Hearts Of Darkness. </p> <p>\"Yeah, that rant he has when he says it's all a disaster is one of the most scary bits of film I've ever seen,\" says Truter. \"It's like a horror film to me. I just hope I'm never in that situation.\" But what, then, is a film-maker like Dwight Yoakam supposed to do if he simply runs out of money? </p> <p>\"Well, it obviously helps if you've got a house worth $825,000,\" Truter laughs. \"But I would suggest that trying to pay for it yourself is a particularly stupid thing to do. If you have a proven track record, like Steven Spielberg, I'd say fair enough. But your first feature... Well, I'd say good luck. And, you know, good on Dwight for having that kind of blind faith. I don't mean to do him down. But after the first day of shooting, blind faith means nothing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mary Woronov is horizontal on a couch, and when she gets up to greet me something within it snaps from the stress. She has always been too much: too tall, too beautiful, too aggressive, too masculine. At school, she was too dangerous to be left alone with other children. As a teenager, her teeth were too crooked, and her mother forced them straight - wishing she could straighten her daughter out, too. </p> <p>Woronov's fine new novel, Snake, draws on such childhood details and on the LA debauchery that came later. But as her other new book, Swimming Underground: My Years in the Warhol Factory, makes clear, it was in mid-60s bohemian Manhattan that this constitutional excessive found a place to call home. She was a leather-clad whip-dancer for the Velvet Underground, a star of Chelsea Girls, ghosted past icons from Tennessee Williams to Dali, gobbled speed and saw her life as art. </p> <p>The near-fatal shooting of Warhol in 1968 spun her into other orbits: as the most rapaciously arrogant and serpentine of Roger Corman's B-movie queens (Death Race 2000, Rock'n'Roll High School), then a hard-partying, late-flowering punk, and a lead role in cult movie Eating Raoul. Painting and porn are on the CV, too, but these coolly sadistic, unpredictable books may be her peak. Now 57, a strange mix of mousy timidity, fierceness and unshielded honesty, impressions of the Factory flood from her, emotional imprints at odds with received history. </p> <p>It was Gerard Malanga - poet, photographer, film-maker - who seduced her into Warhol's world when she was a Cornell art student on a field trip to the Factory; the sight of his camera making sense of her life felt like a baptism. Usually, Billy Name (whose photographs illuminate Swimming Underground) was the one who procured \"superstars\" for the combustible assembly of breathing \"art objects\" Warhol surrounded himself with - the raw material for his movies. What were the criteria for being chosen? </p> <p>\"For one thing, you had to have a fair amount of amphetamine,\" Woronov smiles. \"For another thing, you had to have some kind of gender-slippage, or be very beautiful, like Nico. Surely that was her only talent. I didn't like her, she wasn't very nice. Or you had to be creative with your own body. Like Candy Darling, a man who decided - way before there was an operation to be had - to be this fabulous woman. You had to invent yourself. </p> <p>\"My qualification was that I was very timid about men. I wanted them so much I would imitate them - so I came in with a very masculine air, a very beautiful girl being masculine. Also, there was an innocence about me, and yet I had rage in me, a force-field around me that was violent, which I didn't know what to do with. Warhol figured it out really quickly. He put me in Chelsea Girls.\" </p> <p>Along with Ondine (aka The Pope, the Factory's most sardonically poisonous tongue), Woronov dominated Warhol's greatest movie, a sadistic, coiled bully, letting her violence loose on cowering fellow \"superstars\" Ingrid and Pepper. Her image - \"smouldering, imperious, articulate\", in the words of fan Camille Paglia - looks like a prototype for many women today. But even now, she can't see that she's feminine. </p> <p>\"I don't trust femininity,\" she says with a short, nervous laugh. \"I'm not maternal at all. I don't want children, and I never have. I think it's a sin to bear them. Especially into this world, where there's so much pain and grief. I would die if I made someone live in this world. I'd kill myself. I don't think I should've been put here. I don't see any point to this, I think this is hell. But nevertheless, I'm in it, and I do like the people in it. It's kind of a cruel joke that you just die at the end. I used to be very angry about that. But then, the sadness of old friends dying connects you to humanity. Which I wasn't before.\" </p> <p>Swimming Underground is full of cold fronts, deliberate disconnections from real emotion, as Woronov and the rest let their \"art-object\" existences consume them. You can see them in Billy Name's pictures, in love with each other's bohemian style, ignoring the seedy Manhattan scenes behind them. Woronov would snatch gulps of normal air, in a home she shared with a relatively straight friend. But, like so many 60s figures - Lennon, Kesey and Nixon as much as Warhol - she couldn't wait to get back to the cameras and tapes, the dangerously improvised movie in which the decade's famous seemed determined to star. </p> <p>\"Warhol had his recorder on all the time,\" she says. \"You didn't talk to him, you talked to it. It was easier not to see him and the rest as real people. At that time, I didn't see myself as a real person. My whole life was a performance. If we went somewhere with Warhol, we felt we were being watched, that we were on screen. Now, lots of people seem to feel that way. Then, it was unheard of. It made us feel like super-people, like everyone else was just an audience, that they had no rights. There are benefits to feeling that way. But there are things you leave behind. Like normal compassion.\" </p> <p>The book is at its most compulsive when detailing the self-destructive night-time roamings of this fragile, transgressive elite. Those who went furthest were nicknamed Mole People, pasty from lack of sunlight, tunnelling for new sensations. Warhol, too, when glimpsed, is \"white, empty, waiting to be filled\". Vampire Nest, Woronov calls her penultimate chapter. </p> <p>\"It always ended at dawn,\" she says. \"The city was like the end of the world then. Just before all these people who are not like you go to work and race along the street, there's a sense of the end. The fact that everybody is going to die, the fact that you're not really alive. It was an interesting sense, I liked it. I also remember sitting in rooms and realising it was dawn, and that I would have to stay because I couldn't face that mob. You had to hide because those people didn't understand you. You're an empty shell, you haven't eaten in four days, you can't think, you have this bizarre voice rattling in your head like a broken egg. I mean, you must take cover. Or else, get another shot. </p> <p>\"I didn't like getting another shot, others did, and they really cracked. But my main drug was amphetamine, and I liked coming down from it. It's like the phone is off the hook, and you're still walking around. You get very cold inside, your body feels electric and everything matters. It was like going back to the grave, to sleep.\" </p> <p>The reasons why they pioneered such risky lives, in such an inhospitable era is obscure. But Warhol was their presiding spirit. \"He was fearless,\" Woronov says. \"Especially with the movies. People called them stupid and ugly and boring. But it didn't bother him at all. All those things were just fine. Which made you wonder about him. So, fine, we thought, we'll go with you.\" </p> <p>And, once inside his Factory walls, there were times, for this misfit band, when the tightrope lives they were walking seemed almost blessed. \"We weren't interested in each others' personal problems. I had a lot of them then, but I would forget them when I was with Warhol. And we became this bizarre in-crowd. God only knows why, because there were a lot of boring hours. But we did consciously keep up a certain image, we consciously mocked people. We had nothing to lose - we were outsiders. Everybody hated us anyway. But together, they were afraid of us. All of a sudden, they weren't picking on us, they were moving back. We felt powerful when we were together.\" </p> <p>Woronov's favourite moments were dancing for the Velvet Underground, feeling a \"want\" in their work she recognised. But, she says, \"there's only so long you can do someone like Warhol. He can stay there for ever. No one around him can. And his movies were over. I had nothing to do, and I left. You can't stay there for a friendship. You can't be loyal, the cost is too high. You'd get lost there, and have to stay, like a museum piece. That wasn't for me.\" </p> <p> Instead, she became an actress, parlaying her Chelsea Girls greatness into work for Roger Corman (\"the only time I saw him, he told Sylvester Stallone this was a 'tits and ass movie', so he'd better uncover his ass, which he did\") and all the maverick young directors under him in 70s LA - a different sort of underground. She has painted (\"angsty; kind of difficult to hang on the wall\"), directed and reluctantly starred in a recent soft-core porn series, acts in indie films to this day and has now written these books. </p> <p>Snake's childhood scenes give some clue to the young woman who turned in respectability for risky art. To me, she adds memories of being abandoned at boarding school at six, being \"feral, silent\" on her return, filling her head with \"animals of the night\", becoming like one herself. </p> <p>\"I called the novel Snake because it's the animal that changes its skin,\" she says, \"the animal of constant reinvention. I shed my own skin easily and naturally. It's how I left the Factory before it crashed. I feel like doing it again. I don't ever want to stop.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Swimming Underground (\u00a39.99) and Snake (\u00a313.99) are both published by Serpent's Tail.</p>",
  "You've got to hand it to Anne Robinson who has just been officially crowned rudest person on television. Her services to impudence were earned by presenting a TV game show, The Weakest Link, in which contestants are subjected to her headmistressy brand of prime-time humiliation. \"And you,\" she is wont to inform the loser at the end of the show, \"you go home with nothing.\" <p>Let's face it, not everyone is blessed with a talent for rudeness. To be impressively rude, so rude that you experience a small rush of adrenaline afterwards, takes a cool combination of wit, self-confidence and sheer nerve. Being really rude is scary; it involves picking a fight and to hell with the consequences. </p> <p>\"Yes, thank you, English is my first language,\" I sneered down the phone to British Gas the other day during a particularly vexing dispute. That's the trouble with spontaneous rudeness, it's rarely very witty. Essentially, rudeness is about seizing the power to make another person feel bad. Women aren't very comfortable with that concept and, when it is embraced, it usually manifests itself as bitchiness. </p> <p>It's not that surprising, then, that the other contenders for Robinson's title were male: Jeremy Paxman, Jeremy Clarkson and Eamonn Holmes, no less. Yes, there are rude girls out there but few who can rival her flinty brusqueness. On TV there are plenty of contenders - Daniela Nardini raised stroppiness to an art form in This Life, as does Sophie in the increasingly irritating dot.com drama Attachments. Tellingly, both dramas are set in the workplace, an arena in which female rudeness has its own mythology, usually the power-crazed career bitch or the stroppy cow. </p> <p>Office rudeness is the worst, particularly in these days of being lulled into a sense that our colleagues are substitutes for both friends and family. \"Is that skirt Prada?\" a former colleague on a fashion magazine once asked. \"No,\" I replied, feeling pleased that my M&amp;S bargain had passed muster. \"Didn't think so,\" she said and laughed cruelly. </p> <p>Where rudeness is at its most successful is when it's used with humour. Thus the most popular rude girls on TV - Ruby Wax, Clarissa Dickson-Wright, Jo Brand - are allowed to be rude because they are funny. Other women who are famously impolite tend to be politicians. Anne Widdecombe, Clare Short and the allegedly coarse-mouthed Mo Mowlam are not famed for their politesse but then the Commons is perhaps one of the few places where a talent for picking fights is a huge advantage. </p> <p>Another short cut for successful stroppiness is to be born posh. As W Somerset Maugham observed: \"The right people are rude. They can afford to be.\" Thus Princess Margaret allegedly used to invite guests to spend relaxed dinners with her, only to pull them up on points of royal protocol after they'd drunk several glasses of wine. And if the revelations about Princess Diana in Patrick Jephson's book are to be believed, she too had a talent for rudeness. I mean, calling your father-in-law Stavros isn't very polite, is it? </p> <p> There is a fine line, though, between rudeness and honesty, and sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between the two. \"Rudeness is in the ear of the listener as much as the mouth of the speaker, it's a two-way thing,\" says linguistics professor Deborah Cameron, author of Verbal Hygiene. \"When someone accuses us of being rude, they are doing so against an implicit standard of what polite behaviour should be. </p> <p>\"Linguists have made the claim that women use politeness more than men because they are more concerned with not losing face and that shows in the language we use. Women are more likely to hedge their conversations with words like 'perhaps' and 'maybe'.\" </p> <p>One reason why it is becoming more difficult to say with certainty that someone is being rude is that conventional benchmarks of rudeness no longer apply. Swearing and using slang used to be considered rude behaviour among women. \"That's not necessarily rude, it depends who you're with,\" Cameron says. \"If you're in a group situation, swearing can be a way of claiming solidarity and intimacy. Rudeness relies on a degree of distance, so obviously a stranger swearing at you means something quite different.\" </p> <p>This is true; the same statement can take on very different meanings depending on whether it is made as a joke among friends or it has come out of the blue from someone without context. One of the most breathtakingly rude comments I have ever received was when I was 16 and had a Saturday job in a record shop in Glasgow. A female customer, irate because her credit card had been rejected, was writing a cheque. \"Who do I make it out to?\" Virgin, I told her. She looked me up and down coolly. \"Well, I don't see too many of those around here,\" she sneered, in full earshot of a long queue. I still cringe at the memory.</p>",
  "It is the photographs that snatch at the heart. One after another they appear on the screen: smiling children gazing at the camera with the innocent confidence and certainty of an untroubled future. That is how they were then. And now? Well, who knows? <p>For these are missing children. They are children who have been abducted. They may have been kidnapped, or - most commonly - taken by one parent from the other. Sometimes they have just disappeared. </p> <p>It is every parent's ultimate horror and when, unimaginably, it happens it proves to be a horror that is compounded by helplessness. There seems to be nothing that can be done: the police, the courts, governments, international conventions - all are powerless. Ask Catherine Meyer. She knows. She has used every avenue to try to reach her two children taken in Germany more than six years ago - and as the wife of Sir Christopher Meyer, the British ambassador to the US, she has access to more avenues than most. Yet even the personal intervention of the US president, who approached the German chancellor, hasn't worked. </p> <p>It is that helplessness which is one reason why tonight, at the Savoy Hotel in London, Meyer has assembled a glittering cast for an American-style fund-raising ball to mark the official launch of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children. It is an organisation she has co-founded and which has just been awarded charitable status by the Charities Commission. Cherie Booth QC is the patron of the organisation in Britain and is speaking tonight; Hillary Clinton is in powerful support in the US and has sent a message for the programme. The Savoy will be heaving with child-friendly celebrities: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones are promised, Michael Caine and Shakira, perhaps the Duchess of York; actors, politicians, lawyers, people of power and influence. The aim is to use their names and fame to highlight the issue. </p> <p>\"I have been through this nightmare and there is a real lack of awareness about it,\" says Meyer. Tonight she plans to change all that. In a fatalistic sort of way, she believes that perhaps it is her role now, given that her own children are gone. She hasn't given up on her own case, but after six years she wants to fight for other people's children, too. Her own story is a remarkable one. She lost everything in her fight for her children: job, home, car and savings but then met and married Christopher Meyer. </p> <p>\"When I arrived in Washington I didn't want anyone to know my story,\" she says. Soon, however, she realised she could use her standing to make a real fuss. That is exactly what she has done. Tonight's event is planned to draw attention to this escalating problem, with ever-increasing numbers of children abducted as ever more people travel to distant lands and meet and marry foreigners. \"It is a human rights issue,\" says Meyer. It is about the rights of children. </p> <p>The party is also intended to mark the inauguration of a website, set up in co-operation with the British police <a href=\"http://www.missingkids.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.missingkids.co.uk</a> to try to trace those sweet, smiling faces, those tragic missing children. </p> <p>The website has been in operation for some months - it was used, for example, this summer to try to find Sarah Payne before it was too late. Despite that ghastly outcome, there have been successes and the police are convinced this is a new tool that could be of real help. Both the police and the charity want to expand its use and alert more forces to its existence. It is intended to operate internationally and includes remarkable technical facilities, using ageing techniques for children who have been missing for years, for example. </p> <p>Meyer knows where her missing children are. It doesn't make the pain any easier. Alexander and Constantin are with her ex-husband who has used the courts in Germany in a protracted legal wrangle which has denied her even access to them. Meyer says that according to the terms they agreed on separation, she sent the children on holiday to their father in the summer of 1994. He didn't send them back. Although ordered to do so by the high court in London, under the terms of the Hague Convention which governs this matter, the father appealed to the German courts. The case is still before them. </p> <p>One of the purposes of the campaign is to draw attention to the working of the Hague Convention. Catherine can reel off the statistics of those countries which observe the requirements and the \"return\" rate of abducted children. The UK, for example, returns more than 90% of children abducted here; Germany returns 38%. There is a particular problem between the US and Germany and Meyer has also helped set up another organisation in Washington to co-ordinate parents involved in tug-of-love disputes between the two countries. She has written two books about missing children and has become an expert in international law. She is helping to organise an international conference on the Hague Convention. </p> <p>Her energy and commitment are remorseless. In the three years she has lived in Washington she has addressed committees of both the House of Representatives and the Senate and, on her own behalf, pulled every string she can. </p> <p>It still hasn't worked. Meyer has seen her children for less than 24 hours in all those long years and she has never seen them on her own terms, only in their father's house or at the lawyers'. And they have rejected her when she has seen them. She is matter-of-fact about this. She understands about parent alienation. She knows they have been told things that are not true. It doesn't make it any easier for her. </p> <p>\"They have said: 'We don't want to see you'. 'You have forced the press to lie.' 'You have written a book full of lies'. 'You could have come to see us any time - but you didn't.' They have been told I abandoned them.\" </p> <p>She remembers her children as they were when she lost them. They were aged seven and nine, still little boys who might cry when they fell over and scraped their knees. It is more than six years now since her children ran for comfort in her arms. </p> <p>The pain is unimaginable and only those who have suffered it can really understand. They are \"parent victims\" and they can relate immediately to each other. When I was with Meyer this week she met another mother, Chris O'Sullivan from Cork, whose four-year-old daughter, Deirdre, disappeared with her father last December. There was an immediate empathy between the two women as they met for the first time. \"If anyone had told me at the time Deirdre went that 10 months later it would be as if she had disappeared off the face of the earth, I don't think that I could have gone on living,\" O'Sullivan says. </p> <p>Meyer understood. \"Human beings adapt,\" she says. \"In a way it is easier that my children are still seven and nine for me because otherwise I would be further away from them. But I still dream. Last night I was dreaming about them again.\"</p>",
  "It is not simple for us, nor is it simple for the Palestinians, to live one next to the other, and at times, one within the other. The land at our disposal is very small, distinguished more by borders than space. <p>Our religion too is different. Despite our all being the sons of Abraham there is a big difference between the pronunciations of Moses and those of Mohammed. Our histories are also distinctly unlike. Independence did not figure in Palestinian history until the Oslo accords. And the refugee tragedy became part of it as a result of the war. Jewish history, severed from its land for 2,000 years, recorded the Holocaust, a tragedy the magnitude of which has never been witnessed. </p> <p>This great divide cannot be bridged by turning the clock back. Going backwards is a Sisyphean endeavour. The past cannot be mended, nor is it possible to agree on when the past actually starts: 50 years ago, 100 years ago, 1,400 years ago or maybe even 4,000 years ago. We shall never succeed in reaching an agreement on how far back we must go. </p> <p>Five times Israel had to face outside attacks. The wars did not solve anything - neither for those that triumphed nor for those that were defeated. Both sides paid a high price in human life, loss of time and wasted opportunity. I believe that today all concerned are aware that the price of a sixth war will be even higher, and will prove to be an even greater exercise in futility. </p> <p>What has not been achieved in battle has been accomplished around the negotiating table. Egypt has regained all its land, including the oil fields along the Suez canal and, in exchange, Israel secured formal peace. Jordan, too,' regained all its land and its water, and peace was again procured. Israel withdrew from Lebanon according to the UN resolution, and with no political intervention in Lebanon's affairs. </p> <p>Terror did not bear fruit. In one of my conversations with Yasser Arafat, he said: \"Look at what you did to me. I was one of the most popular figures amidst my people, and its youth. Today, the young tear my picture to shreds, and all on account of the Oslo accords.\" </p> <p>I replied: \"You stood at the head of the Palestinian people for over 30 years. Prior to that, the mufti of Jerusalem led the Palestinian people, also for 30 years. Both of you turned your backs on Israel. You refused to engage in a dialogue with it. You exercised terror. You dispersed threats. It can't be denied that you were both very popular. But you brought catastrophe on your people. Refugee camps came into being, people were uprooted, the economy lagged behind and you created fathomless sadness. Your popularity might be tarnished, but now you have conferred on your people the gift of a nation in the making. Assuming responsibility for the territories in which they live has led to a well-defined political framework, economic development and a fair dialogue. Those that rip your picture today will be grateful for your undertaking tomorrow.\" </p> <p>Not only is it pointless to return to the days of wars and terror, it is unfeasible. Since the end of the cold war there has been no one to fund conflicts in the Middle East.Russia is no longer prepared to provide arms and costly support. Without backing, it is hard to mobilise the required arms and money for war. Nor is it possible to return to the situation in which terror prevailed. To engage in terror a few speeches are needed to fan the flames, and a small number of terrorists to kill innocent citizens, to make headlines. </p> <p>Nowadays, the PLO leader, and the PLO itself, assume a completely different kind of responsibility. The Palestinian Authority comprises an organisation that counts 120,000 employees (including policemen and teachers) and their salaries must be ensured. Economic development is dependent on relations with Europe, the US and Israel. If terror does resume, it will undermine Palestinian interests. </p> <p>For its part, Israel has no wish to return to Gaza or Nablus or Jericho. Its sons will never again serve as a target for stone-throwers and bullets, a focal point for hate or an obstacle to economic development. We withdrew from all these places for moral motives. We did not shed slavery in Egypt to create a masters' domain in our country. We shall not revert to ruling the Palestinian people. There is no other option, even in the wake of the bullets and the burning accusations voiced on both sides, than for these parties to return to the negotiating table. </p> <p>Today the mission seems impossible. But the situation in Europe in 1944 also seemed impossible. In the space of the short period between 1914 and 1945 Europe suffered two bloody wars. Over 50m people lost their lives and many others lost eyes, hands, legs, their future and their families. The tide of hate rose, and the bloodshed of Europe's history seemed to bode ill for any change. But out of the ashes of war arose the EU, overcoming all the hurdles of the past, free of war for over 50 years and now enjoying tremendous economic prosperity. </p> <p> Europe moved from its agrarian and industrial past into an era of science and technology, in which borders suddenly lost their relevance, hate took on the appearance of excess baggage and cooperation became as important as air. This has to happen in the Middle East as well. Diplomatic peace alone cannot contain the arsenal of hate and recriminations of the past. Only economic peace will expose all peoples to the potential of the future. </p> <p>What we are witnessing in the Middle East is not only a religious confrontation. Or a historical contest. Or a fight for territories. It is a clash between two different ages in history: the agrarian era that gives land priority, and the scientific era that provides all peoples with the opportunity to gain information (an opportunity that stems from the force of knowledge rather than the force of arms). This information must be acquired, not conquered. </p> <p>Europe went through a period of mod ernisation. The Middle East must go through a similar period. Despite differences in our religions, and the intense controversy over the control of holy sites, territorial compromises need to be made even in the absence of religious concessions. Time must be allowed to take its course. We must put into effect all that has been agreed upon and reach an accord on everything that can be conceded. (We have already reached many important agreements - in Camp David territorial partition, marking of borders, the future of the settlements, defence arrangements and even an independent Palestinian state). Moreover, negotiations must continue on points still being debated (including the Temple Mount). After all, no side can impose a solution unacceptable to the other. And if no mutual agreement is found today, we must wait whatever time it takes to reach one. </p> <p>I know that negotiations do not only constitute a bargaining process, but also serve as fertile ground for creativity. And what seems to be unattainable today may be resolved tomorrow by means of a new notion, creative thinking. We have already made many comprises. We should refrain from placing at our political focal point only those subjects for which a solution has not been found. We might well hit on constructive ideas, no less than on destructive strategies. I heard a trainer say to the youngsters who took part in the cross-Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) competition: \"If you reach the half-way point across the Kinneret, and feel tired, do not turn back. With the same energy you will make it to the finishing line on the opposite shore.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Shimon Peres is a former prime minister of Israel and currently minister for regional cooperation </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The most notorious of East Timor's militia leaders was arrested yesterday on suspicion of being involved in the sacking of a UN refugee agency office in West Timor last month during which three members of staff were hacked to death. <p>The national police chief, General Suroyo Bimantoro, accused Eurico Guterres of refusing to hand over weapons and instructing hundreds of his men to take back guns they had surrendered to the police in the town of Atambua, near the border with East Timor. </p> <p>The move coincides with UN reports that the militias' grip on the approximately 130,000 East Timorese refugees in West Timor is starting to weaken in some camps and that hundreds of refugees have returned to their homeland in the last couple of weeks. </p> <p>Mr Guterres was picked up at a Jakarta hotel and questioned for more than seven hours at the police headquarters. His lawyer, Suhardi Sumomulyono, said the arrest was not legal because the officers had no warrant and the charges were extremely unclear. If convicted, his client faces six years imprisonment. </p> <p>A police senior superintendent, Saleh Saaf, said: \"Eurico Guterres was arrested after there was enough evidence for him to become a suspect in the destruction and burning of the UNHCR office in Atambua.\" </p> <p>He did not say if Mr Guterres was also suspected of the murder of the three employees of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. </p> <p>Gen Bimantoro said Mr Guterres's detention was not linked to his being named earlier this week as a suspect for atrocities committed in East Timor last year. \"The East Timor investigation is still on-going,\" he said. </p> <p>Since the UNHCR murders Indonesia has come under increasing international pressure to deal with the militias. All the international aid agencies have withdrawn from West Timor and are refusing to return until those responsible for the aid workers' deaths have been detained, the militias disarmed and disbanded and law and order restored, a spokesman for the UNHCR, Peter Kessler, said. </p> <p>He said Mr Guterres's arrest was \"a step forward\", but added: \"Right now we're only seeing baby steps [from the Indonesian authorities]. We have a long way to go before the refugees can be considered free and in a position to make up their own minds whether to return to East Timor.\" </p> <p>The United States, Britain and the World Bank have threatened to suspend aid to Jakarta if the problems in West Timor are not resolved in the next few months. </p> <p>Jakarta's attempts to disarm the militias, which want East Timor returned to Indonesian rule, have so far proved a relative failure. Only a few dozen rifles and several hundred homemade firearms have been recovered. </p> <p>Most of their weapons were given to them by the Indonesian military last year when they were trying to destabilise East Timor in the run-up to the self-determination referendum, which was won overwhelmingly by the independence side. It was after this vote that the militias rampaged through East Timor and drove more than 270,000 people into West Timor. </p> <p>Mr Kessler said that the increasing number returning in the past few weeks showed that the militias' grip was slackening in some areas. </p> <p>\"In some areas the militias have withdrawn and the refugees are starting to pack up,\" he said. \"In other areas they [the militias] are still taking roll calls every week and in some camps every day. They are forbidding movement, even to go shopping for food.\"</p>",
  "An attempt by the Honduran authorities to limit bizarre names for children may seem like much ado about nothing - unless your parents have decided to call you Bujia (Spark Plug), Defecacion Flores (Defecation Flowers) or Llanta de Milagro (Miracle Tyre). <p>All these are legally registered first names which Honduran parents have given to their children in recent years, and which the national electoral tribunal feels are simply over the top. </p> <p>The tribunal, which oversees the country's public birth registry, announced earlier this week that it would ask the legislature to forbid parents from registering their children under \"extravagant or offensive\" names. </p> <p>The tribunal also plans to allow children to sue parents who gave them \"gross or insulting\" names. </p> <p>\"We are concerned by the custom among peasants of giving absurd names to their children,\" it declared in a statement. </p> <p>\"Without doubt, such names are a bother to the people who have to carry them through life.\" </p> <p>Particularly troublesome, it says, are naming practices in the largely indigenous Gracias a Dios in eastern Honduras. </p> <p>The province's name translates as \"Thank God\". </p> <p>\"It is common [there] for people to employ names usually used for automobile parts,\" the tribunal said. </p> <p>A young man there called Motor Martinez could meet the young girl - not a relative - called Bujia Martinez (Spark Plug Martinez). </p> <p>But if the proposed law wins approval, they will not be allowed to call their child Ignition. </p> <p>Nor would they be able to use the names of well-known personalities. </p> <p>According to the electoral rolls, at least one hapless Honduran bears the given name Bill Clinton, and another Ronald Reagan. </p> <p><br>AP</p>",

  "The United Nations is being heavily criticised for picking a new occupant for one of its most important international posts in secret. <p>The post of UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the head of an agency which works with 22m refugees throughout the world, is due to be filled by the end of the month. </p> <p>The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, was in Geneva this week for discussions with the UNHCR executive about the position. </p> <p>But the International Council of Voluntary Organisations (ICVO), which represents most of the non-governmental aid organisations, is critical of the secrecy. </p> <p>Frances Stevenson, head of programmes for M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, a member of the ICVO, said yesterday: \"There is no transparency at all. It is not clear who is being considered. </p> <p>She said: \"Like any democracy, we should know who the candidates are and there should be a public arena to allow debate rather than have it done behind closed doors.\" </p> <p>The ICVO, in an attempt to open up the process, wrote to various people mentioned as candidates, asking them to provide \"manifestos\". </p> <p>The results, published in the latest issue of its magazine Talk Back, are mixed. </p> <p>Some candidates refused to answer and others gave only sketchy details. </p> <p>Mr Annan declined at a press conference on Monday to name the candidates he was considering. </p> <p>\"This is not a public election. We have organised a long search. In fact, some of the candidates were not even candidates - they had to be approached. </p> <p>\"I don't think it would be appropriate for me to embarrass people who were not even themselves candidates by throwing their name around if they do not happen to be selected,\" he said. </p> <p>The confirmed candidates, either self-declared or mentioned by their governments, include: Bernard Kouchner, head of the UN administration in Kosovo, a former French health minister, and former head of M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res; Emma Bonino, former EU commissioner for humanitarian affairs; Giuseppe Migone, head of the Italian senate's foreign-affairs commission; and Knut Vollebaek, a former Norwegian foreign minister. </p> <p>African countries have put forward Maxime-Leopold Zollner de Medeiros of Benin, a former UNHCR official. </p> <p>Other candidates include Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN's representative in East Timor and highly regarded as a former assistant high commissioner; the current assistant high commissioner Soren Jessen-Petersen; and Jan Pronk, a Dutch minister. </p> <p>The incumbent, Sadako Ogata, of Japan, is retiring. </p> <p>Mr Annan will make the appointment, which then has to be approved by the UN. This is normally a formality. </p> <p>The UNHCR, which has a budget of $1.2bn (\u00a3818m), has been criticised for its management style and for apparently moving away from its original remit of protecting refugees to seeking their reintegration. </p> <p>UN officials say that, apart from leadership and management qualities, the clear preference is for someone with a humanitarian background and experience with asylum issues, fundraising and advocacy. Mr Annan said he wanted \"somebody who will have the confidence of the donor countries and the NGO community\". </p> <p>The two names most frequently mentions by diplomats are Mr Kouchner and Mr Vieira de Mello. </p> <p>Mr Kouchner's reputation for being outspoken counts marginally against him.</p>",
  "<p>DNA fingerprinting, a technique routinely used to convict murderers and rapists, is being pioneered in Florida as a way of catching poachers hunting endangered wildlife. </p> <p>The technique has been developed by Ginger Clark, a senior lab technician at the University of Florida. \"I tend to get bored easily,\" she says. \"I was friends with a few people at the Fish and Wildlife Commission. About three years ago they wanted a test to be able to tell white tailed deer meat from other kinds of deer because they wanted to make hunting white tailed deer illegal. So that's what got me started. I worked out a test. Then I worked out one to tell what sex the deer was and it all snowballed from there.\" </p> <p>In Florida it is illegal to hunt white tailed deer for all but a short season; females can be hunted for only two days a year. Unscrupulous poachers are known to hunt both sexes of this rare deer and pass the meat off as another sort of venison. Clark's test can identify the species of deer, the sex, even what territory the animal is from, and on occasions, a particular individual. The test is based on identifying DNA from within the animal's mitochondria, small organs found in every cell which are inherited maternally. A hair, a few drops of blood or a scrap of flesh are usually enough to extract the relevant genetic material. </p> <p>\"The test is used in only a small proportion of cases,\" says Captain John Moran, investigation supervisor at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. He explains that poachers often confess if caught red-handed. \"Occasionally individuals are not going to be helpful and then we gather forensic evidence.\" </p> <p>He is currently prosecuting an individual who was very clearly unhelpful. An officer found a freshly killed doe in a field and waited to see if the poacher would return. But a fire broke out nearby and he was asked to help. When he returned early the next morning, the deer had been removed. </p> <p>\"The suspect lived about a mile or so away,\" says Moran, \"We went round to his house and found him asleep on the kitchen table next to a pile of entrails. He had blood and meat all over his trousers, but the rest of the animal was nowhere to be seen. He said it was from a deer he'd killed a few days ago.\" </p> <p>The officers took samples from the entrails, blood and hair on the table, as well as hair and blood left in the field where the deer had been killed. The results of the DNA test proved the deer samples were from the same animal. The poacher is likely to be convicted and to face a fine of up to $1,000 and a year in jail. </p> <p>Clark's test is also being used by the Fish and Wildlife Commission to investigate crimes against other endangered animals such as black bears and sea turtles which it is illegal to kill, and wild turkey and alligators which can be hunted but for a very short hunting season. </p> <p>Every year Florida holds a lottery, the lucky winners get to shoot 'gators. Because the lab at Florida University has been studying sea turtles for years and taking blood samples from the mothers as they return to their natal beaches, Clark can match up the DNA from poached animals very precisely to determine the exact beach from which the poachers stole them - even if the turtles have already been cooked. Ironically, the poachers are aided by wildlife conservation since conservation officials watch where the mother turtles lay their eggs, and put a flag above the nests. </p> <p>The idea is to warn people where the nests are as it is illegal to disturb or harass a turtle. However, the poachers use the flags as a way of telling where the eggs are. On the black market turtle eggs sell for a dollar and a quarter raw and a dollar and a half cooked. They have great appeal to certain clientele though Clark cannot understand why. \"They're nasty raw and still slimey on the inside when they're cooked,\" she says, \"The thought of eating them makes my skin crawl.\" </p> <p>Jim Ray, a local farmer, has started using Clark's technique, not only to guard against poachers, but also as a way of helping the hunting fraternity. He breeds white tailed deer specifically for shooting parties. By building up a profile of all 300 of his deer, he can determine which deer to breed from to ensure he gets the biggest \"racks\"; allowing hunters to kill deer with large antlers is more lucrative. </p> <p>If any of the deer are stolen for meat, breeding, or by \"weirdoes\" who will hang their stuffed heads up as trophies as if they'd shot the deer themselves, the Fish and Wildlife Commission could tell if it was one of Ray's deer. \"We really want to set a standard for the entire deer farming industry,\" says Ray. </p> <p>The key difference between DNA testing for poaching and for murder, is that it is the victim, rather than the villain, whose genetic profile is investigated. While the technique is undoubtedly useful, fingerprinting the perpetrator may one day also be an option. As it is, the tests do not always work in the law enforcement officers' favour. Clark describes how she was once given a blood sample which the Fish and Wildlife Commission was convinced came from a black bear. </p> <p>\"It was actually from a racoon. These guys from Fish and Wildlife are rarely wrong - he probably was poaching black bear, but they just didn't catch him in the act that time.\"</p>",
  "<p>Surfing the web is supposedly a solitary occupation, so why not get a group together and take a tour? You can take your friends to different sites while chatting about the things you can see, even if your friends are scattered across the globe. The educational and commercial implications of this approach are immense. But better do it soon, because there's a monster devouring the internet, and communal surfing could soon be just another adjunct of ICQ (\"I Seek You\"). </p> <p>Although it is still struggling to make an impression, the group surfing idea is far from new. It goes back at least as far as January 1995, when <a href=\"mailto:marj@ubique.co.il\">Marjorie Schejter</a> posted one of the most exciting messages to hit the WWW-talk mailing list. </p> <p>She was announcing a test version of Ubique's Virtual Places software, an \"extension to the web\", and the Sesame Navigator browser. \"People who use Sesame will be able to meet each other at your web pages, interact in real-time using text chat and audio, and conduct guided tours of your site and of other Virtual Places sites,\" she wrote. And it sounded like an Open Sesame for the web. </p> <p>This wasn't a mass market program - Virtual Places was available only for expensive Unix workstations - but it was surely just a matter of time before someone came along with something that ran on Windows PCs and Macs, and used a central server to synchronise surfers, instead of asking webmasters to run a \"virtual reality\" application. </p> <p>But while many companies have tried, none seems to have been much of a success. Gooey has come closest, but even that has struggled to reach critical mass. And that's the problem with all the systems that have started from scratch. You can visit half a dozen of your favourite websites with CrowdBurst, Odigo, TogetherWeb, TourBar or whatever, and sometimes not find anyone there at all. </p> <p>When you do find someone else at a website, either they turn out to be Brazilian (and claim not to speak English) or an Israeli (and claim not to work for a software developer) or else your message requesting a chat times out and you don't make contact at all. Well, that's what happened to me: an evening trying different systems for this article netted just one brief chat. </p> <p>It isn't that group surfing programs are hard to use: most get you up and running within 10-15 minutes. Typically you go to the home website and download a browser plug-in that identifies you to the system. It's best to save the file to a common directory, such as C:\\Dowloads on a PC, and run it from there, thinking carefully about the implications of the various questions you may be asked. As well as a nickname and an email address, details may include your gender, age, marital status, languages spoken, job, hobbies and interests, and even your star sign. Most of these will be made available to other users who may look you up before deciding whether to accept or reject an offer to chat. </p> <p>Once installed, the plug-in will add a side-bar or an extension to the bottom of your browser or, like Odigo, run pop-up consoles that help you find other users and send them messages, much like any instant messaging software. With \"community surfing\" add-ons, the tour guide or group leader can take other users to different websites, or pass control to another user. </p> <p>There's no doubt that these systems could be very useful in, for example, customer service applications, education and training. And they could provide newbies with conducted tours that introduce them to the best of the web, perhaps as pre-packaged sets of web addresses. But there is considerable doubt about whether communal surfing will ever become a mass market, or if it does, that the companies providing these applications will become rich and famous. </p> <p>The problem is that their initial premise is wrong. For huge numbers of people, surfing is not a solitary business. While online, they are also using a text-chat or instant messaging service, and the market for internet-based chat has already been taken. It is dominated by ICQ, which is owned by America Online, and by America Online's own Instant Message (IM) feature. </p> <p>ICQ already has more than 73 million users, and AOL takes the total to 138 million: a large proportion of the web. Even Microsoft, which can distribute its IM software with Windows, has only about 20 million users. </p> <p>And if you look at ICQ, it has not only been growing at a prodigious rate, it has been adding new features and new services just as quickly. There is now almost nothing you cannot do with ICQ. You can send instant messages, exchange files, keep notes, send email, send SMS messages to GSM mobile phones, create your own web page, send greetings cards ... and with ICQ Surf, \"surf along with other ICQ Surf users, find people who share your interests and chat with them on the same web page!\" </p> <p>With the new ICQPhone, you can even use internet-telephone technology to talk-and-surf, using your voice as well as, or instead of, typing in text. This is the nascent market that Firetalk and Cahoots probably thought they had to themselves. </p> <p> All this means that ICQ's software has become something of a monster: the basic file is now a 5 megabyte download, and there are 13 optional plug-ins. However, there's rarely a shortage of people to chat to. The problem with ICQ is keeping people away. </p> <p>And whereas most online chat and communal surfing programs are limited to one or two operating systems, sometimes only Windows, ICQ supports most clients to some degree, including Palm and Windows CE handhelds. </p> <p>AOL probably understood the power of instant messaging before the rest of us. It bought Ubique, the pioneer, in September 1995, when the idea was still permeating through the web, then sold it again, in May 1998, to IBM's Lotus Software division. Just a month later, AOL took over Mirabilis, the developer of ICQ, swapping a loser for a winner. It was a smart move, and one that will be hard for any start-up to overcome. </p> <p>Still, one curious point about the whole online chat/group surfing field is how much it owes to Israeli companies. Both Ubique and Mirabilis were founded in Israel; so were Gooey, vTrails, (the company responsible for <a href=\"http://www.TourBar.com\" target=\"_new\">TourBar.com</a>), and <a href=\"http://www.n2g.com\" target=\"_new\">n2g.com</a>, which launched its \"guided surfing technology\" earlier this year. </p> <p>Success breeds success, of course. But if you do take up communal surfing, don't be surprised if you keep bumping into Israelis.</p>",

  "Pierre Trudeau, who has died of prostate cancer aged 80, was Canada's most intellectual and flamboyant prime minister. His disdain for Quebec nationalism, belief in a bilingual, multicultural federation, and commitment to the constitutional entrenchment of civic rights and freedoms were the hallmarks of his 17 years in government. <p>Elected to the Canadian parliament in 1965, he rose meteorically to the leadership of the Liberal party in 1968. He won three successive general elections, lost to the Conservatives in 1979, then led the Liberals back to power in 1980. In his final government he secured a clear \"no\" vote in Quebec's first referendum on sovereignty-association, and entrenched Canada's constitution with a charter of rights and freedoms. </p> <p>Trudeau was born in Montreal in 1919. His mother had Scottish and French-Canadian roots. His father was pur laine Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois , an ambitious Montreal lawyer from a long line of unilingual peasant-farmers. Though his early death traumatised Pierre, his shrewd business deals secured the family a $1m fortune. </p> <p>After completing law school in 1943 and articling for a year in Montreal, he took courses in political economy at Harvard, the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics. </p> <p>Back in Quebec in 1949, Trudeau was shocked to find the province gripped by Catholic nationalism. In 1965 he stood in the federal election, determined to address the French-Canadian question from Ottawa. In 1967 he entered Lester Pearson's cabinet as justice minister. Trudeau modernised laws on divorce, homosexuality and abortion, arguing that \"the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation\". But it was his liaisons with women that inverted his mantra of \"reason over passion\". There was nightclubbing at Commonwealth conferences, an affair with Barbra Streisand, and his secret marriage in 1971 to Margaret Sinclair. Some 30 years his junior, she bore him three children, helped to win the 1974 election, and then rebelled with doped-out indiscretions. </p> <p>Trudeaumania took root in February 1968, when he announced his candidacy for the Liberal leadership. His charisma and ability to reason clearly in both languages appealed at a time when Quebec tensions were, literally, exploding in mail-boxes around Montreal. Canadians adored this sexy genius, who wanted to create a \"just society\". In April 1968 Trudeau, now party leader and sworn in as Canada's 15th prime minister, called a general election, and on June 25, 1968, secured the first federal Liberal majority since 1953. He set Canada on an independent foreign policy course, opening diplomatic links with China and reducing its commitment to Nato. But his main aims were to counter Quebec nationalism, build national unity, overhaul government and ensure Canada's constitutional decolonisation. </p> <p>When Trudeau called a general election in 1972 his campaign strategy proved weak. The love-in was over, and unemployment had soared. The Liberals scraped back to power with 109 seats, against the Tories' 107, and Trudeau formed a minority government with support from the New Democratic party. But inflation and unemployment spiralled as the Liberals were hit by the 1973 oil crisis. </p> <p>In May 1979 the Liberals' inability to boost the economy brought Joe Clark's Conservatives to minority government. Trudeau was shattered. In November he announced his retirement. But it was not the end. Three weeks later the Conservative government was defeated. Trudeau stayed on, and in February 1980 won another majority government. In that final term there was the second oil crisis, an intensification of energy battles with western Canada, and new tensions in the relationship with the United States. But the May 1980 Quebec referendum produced a clear 60-40 victory for the federalists. </p> <p>In 1982 the Queen and Trudeau signed the proclamation of a new Canadian constitution, and the Quebec government was bound by a charter it loathed. In 1984 Canada was made officially bilingual. </p> <p>In many senses Trudeau had won his battle against Quebec nationalism, but he had not managed to create the pan-Canadian nation-building instrument that would fully clarify the relationship between all Canadians and the federal state. </p> <p>Two years later he left office and joined a Montreal law firm. He re-emerged in 1987 and 1991 to fight constitutional proposals to recognise Quebec as a distinct society. This won him respect in western Canada, but rekindled nationalist loathing in Quebec. Indeed, in October 1995, when the prime minister, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, staged a rally in Montreal to save Canada from its closest call in the second Quebec referendum, Trudeau, the man who had championed federalism all his life, was asked to stay away. Joseph Phillippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau, politician, born October 18, 1919; died September 28, 2000</p>",
  "<p>Desperate last-ditch talks between the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, were under way late last night to save the Middle East peace process and stop the week-long wave of violence which has claimed 61 lives. </p> <p>The two leaders agreed to meet face-to-face in the US ambassador's residence in Paris after a day of frenetic US and French diplomatic efforts. The meeting began five hours later than planned, after two rounds of separate meetings with the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, and the French president, Jacques Chirac. </p> <p>Both Mr Barak and Mr Arafat at first strenuously resisted a face-to-face meeting, with Mr Barak declaring he would not be willing to see Mr Arafat until the violence had come to an end. </p> <p>For his part, Mr Arafat said he would not consent to such talks until he had guarantees for the safety of his people and an inquiry was set up into the six days of violence . A compromise was reached, with each side agreeing to review the week's events. </p> <p>\"We accepted American ideas that each side will examine its own activities, that our security teams will sit together to clarify what happened and then we'll sit with the American partners to see what happened and to try to make sure that coordination will be better in the future and that such events could not be repeated in the future,\" Mr Barak said after the Chirac meeting. </p> <p>In Gaza, Israeli forces showed no signs of bowing to international pressure over their response to waves of stone-throwing youths. A nine-year-old Palestinian boy died after being shot through the chest in clashes at the flashpoint Netzarim junction and a helicopter gunship unleashed salvos of rockets into apartment blocks in which gunmen had taken up positions. A 21-year-old Palestinian was shot dead in the firefight that ensued. </p> <p>Earlier yesterday, Mr Barak said it was up to the Palestinians to decide whether or not they wanted a peace agreement. </p> <p>\"We hold chairman Arafat and the Palestinian authority responsible for the initiation of this wave of violence,\" Mr Barak said. \"We are not initiating any violence, but every morning youngsters accompanied by Palestinian soldiers are opening fire on Israeli citizens.\" </p> <p>Mr Barak said that a peace agreement was within reach, but added that it was his job to defend the citizens of Israel and that he would do it to the last. \"We are not living in western Europe or in America,\" he said. \"We live in a tough neigbourhood and we must protect our citizens and soldiers.\" </p> <p>Mr Arafat said after his meeting with President Chirac that he wanted guarantees of protection for his people and an inquiry into the causes of violence. Asked what his conditions were for a tripartite meeting, he said: \"Protection and an international inquiry commission.\" </p> <p>Yesterday's clashes in the Gaza Strip were less ferocious than in early days, but the marked reluctance of some 38,000 Palestinian police in the West Bank and Gaza to take harsh measures to restrain their protesters means this week-long spasm of violence may not be spent. </p> <p>Tensions are also simmering among Arab citizens of Israel, where thousands of acres of forest were ablaze in more than 100 arson attacks by suspected protesters. </p> <p>Outside the Israeli army bunker at Netzarim junction, a crossroads in the Gaza Strip that was the scene of the bloodiest clashes this week, crowds of young Palestinians collected in the early afternoon, drifting away from the procession of mourners carrying the flag-draped funeral shroud of a young man killed a day earlier. </p> <p>They chanted Allah o Akbar and advanced in waves on the Israeli post, scattering, or throwing themselves to the ground when bursts of live rounds were let loose. \"I was very scared,\" said Hanan al-Habiba, 18. \"I couldn't see because of the dust or hear because of the big roar of the missiles.\" </p> <p>When one man was wounded, fellow protesters, trying to keep as low to the ground as they could, dragged and pushed him 300 yards to an ambulance, passing him from one person to the next. </p> <p>A handful of Palestinian police watched from a distance. \"If they have a gun, I say: 'Go and shoot'. I can't risk a fight between my soldiers and him,\" said Majdi, a police lieutenant who would give only his first name. </p> <p>\"Yesterday, we tried to stop them but they turned against us.\" He pointed to the charred remains of a police car and a command post. \"Look what they did to us yesterday.\" </p> <p>In the West Bank, a gun battle erupted in Nablus near another flashpoint, a controversial Jewish pilgrimage site. There was firing in Tulkarm and sporadic stone-throwing in Hebron and near Bethlehem. No casualties were reported.</p>",
  "<p>Goliath beware. In the fertile lands of internet radio, David just found his slingshot. And, fittingly, it is called Aim. </p> <p>In the music industry, Goliath has brothers. There are five of them, the \"major\" record labels. Between them they control a mighty 74% of the music market. Time Warner, EMI, Universal, Sony and BMG all loom large while, by contrast, the remaining 26% - the independent record companies - number more than 400. </p> <p>As equally diverse as the \"indies\" are the number of new digital technologies springing up - internet radio, broadband television, mobile phone radio - offering new avenues for the labels' content. </p> <p>But there is a problem. The essence of British copyright law is thus: if a company profits from an artist's work by broadcasting, the artist and their label are due compensation. In terrestrial broadcasting, all is well. Several collecting bodies amass due royalties for the artists, labels, publishers and composers. </p> <p>But no one collects online fees. That means that, with blanket licences unavailable, the indies are in danger. If a broadcaster wants to license independent music, each tiny label is in a weak bargaining position. Worse still, if a broadcaster had to approach each of the 400 indies in turn, the logistical headache becomes a complete turn off. Labels do not get copyright fees, broadcasters cannot license content and emerging markets are left in stasis. </p> <p>Enter the Association of Independent Music (Aim). Rep resenting more than 95% of Britain's indies, Aim solves the two problems in one. It is a one-stop shop for broadcasters looking to license independent music and it wields the indie's market share the only way it is useful: as a whole. Even more importantly, while the majors deliberate, deny and dread the issue of new technologies like digital distribution and internet radio, Aim is taking the bull by the hard drive. </p> <p>In July, Aim launched its trial: labels allowed legal access to their digital back catalogues to broadcasters. The goal, in six months' time, is a licensing agreement for digital music, that everyone has agreed to and participated in forming. One-nil to the indies. </p> <p>Playing centre forward for Aim is the recently appointed Mo Darbyshire. </p> <p>An expert within the broadcast industry, Darbyshire is also the director of music services at Sky. It is her task to conduct this trial and then assemble a licensing scheme. </p> <p>\"Aim has two major advantages,\" she explains. \"One, having autonomy and two, being able to move very quickly with it. I would be very surprised if the majors were able to put a licensing scheme together as quickly as Aim will be able to.\" </p> <p>The task facing Aim, with its target of a digital licensing scheme, is not an easy one. It must establish, to the industry's satisfaction, a scale of remuneration over a vast variety of new media. </p> <p>Just what is the worth of a track played on internet radio? Over a mobile phone? To subscription broadband TV? There are hard decisions that must be taken, but at least the indies are tackling them. The majors, by contrast, are stuck like a rabbit in headlights. </p> <p>When the majors are not vainly trying to make the whole digital music phenomenon disappear, by suing companies such as Napster and My.MP3.com, they are reacting to the possibilities of digital music about as quickly as Blair to a fuel crisis. \"I understand their nervousness,\" adds Mo Darbyshire, \"but they need to get hold of it by the throat. The technology is here and it's not going away. I don't think that digital distribution is going to be quite the threat that everyone thinks.\" </p> <p>Just as radio did not destroy newspapers, or in turn television replace radio, every new medium forces a market repositioning, seldom elimination. </p> <p>The majors, however, have yet to decide whether digital distribution is incremental or substitutional to their business. Is it core, near core or incidental to what they do? </p> <p>The problem is, digital distribution blurs the boundaries between broadcasting and product. Aim's trial does not include downloads, the source of <a href=\"http://www.My.MP3.com\" target=\"_new\">My.MP3.com</a> and Napster's grief. </p> <p>That's a product the labels want to sell individually. But what is the difference between listening to a CD and having audio streamed to your hi-fi? </p> <p>The issue of internet radio, again, makes the major's very nervous. Online radio is an interactive experience and flips on its head the old model of radio as a passive listening experience. </p> <p>As Aim's legal adviser, Helen Smith explains: \"Internet radio means 20 different things to 10 different people.\" Aim's trial covers the use of continuous or live streaming, looped productions and archived or on-demand productions. The issue of advance play listing worries the majors no end, because why buy a track you could record? </p> <p>From a UK perspective, the majors' hands are, in many ways, tied by US parent companies. Andy Strickland, the editor of Dotmusic.com, Britain's biggest music website, explains: \"We say to the majors 'this situation is mad.' They reply, 'sorry but our business affairs are in California and this is their policy'. </p> <p>\"Nobody wants to make a decision or formalise a partnership and then have to be responsible. So everyone's having 'trials' and waiting for front runners to emerge.\" </p> <p>The reason for the major label paralysis that is stalling growth, however, dates back to a painful 1980's experience, the MTV fiasco. Caught out by the explosion in music videos, major labels lost the chance to profit from the content they'd produced. By some clever negotiating with individual labels, MTV by-passed the central licensing authorities. It was to prove the beginning of the end for blanket licenses. </p> <p> Even though MTV massively promoted major labels' products, those labels fear donating their content. But as Dotmusic's deputy editor, James Poletti explains: \"There isn't one single winner emerging from the internet in the same way MTV rose to stand alongside the majors. The competition is much more fierce and the start-up costs aren't anything like as high.\" </p> <p>The rise of MTV left the indie labels out in the cold. With websites like Dotmusic, a member or \"friend\" of Aim, considering the internet radio market, the Aim trial gives broadcasters legitimacy and the indies a head start. </p> <p>As Poletti explains: \"The independent labels have got a captive audience. If we wanted to launch an internet radio station today, the only way we could do it was if we used the labels affiliated with Aim. Our users would hear nothing by the majors.\" </p> <p>One company launching internet radio stations is Capital Radio. While the station currently simulcasts its conventional shows online, taking advantage of a licensing loophole, it has plans for three internet specific stations. </p> <p>Three niche channels, provisionally called Diva (for young professional women), Rage (hard dance and nu-metal) and Urban Grooves (soul and R'n'B), are designed to target specific markets. </p> <p>Online radio does not fit conventional broadcast models. The more listeners you have online, for example, the more it costs you for extra bandwidth and equipment to serve them. </p> <p>Furthermore, \"narrow casting\" as Capital refers to it, is tailor-made for niche music in niche markets. Gone are the days of playing the 10 top-selling singles four times a day. Stations can afford to cater to the vast numbers of people with more diverse interests in music. </p> <p>To \"extract value\" from listeners, Capital ensures the radio icon that sits on your desktop has advertising tailored to the particular niche demographic to which you belong, and the music tracks are played with audio ads running between them. And, next to a picture of the album artwork, there is a link which allows you to impulse-buy the album from which the music you are listening to is taken. </p> <p>Capital Interactive's head of programming and production, Tom Laidlaw, explains: \"Wouldn't it be great to be able to buy tracks on the radio without having to hum it to the sales assistant in HMV? That's what we're trying to offer: radio with a 'buy it' button. It's a holy grail.\" </p> <p>Again the boundaries are blurred. With Capital Radio the broadcaster and the retailer, they sit on both sides of the fence. Laid law denies any conflict of interest. \"As soon as a radio station compromises its output, it's finished,\" he says. </p> <p>Equally, with pack shots of CDs displayed as a track plays, isn't it a small step (in bandwidth terms) to show accompanying videos? Thus a radio broadcaster becomes a kind of e-MTV. </p> <p>Capital also has plans to target markets abroad in the future. Talks have begun with undisclosed companies with technology capable of tailoring adverts to individual countries. </p> <p>Welcome to the future of internet radio: personalisation. Stepping beyond niche broadcasting, where the content is shaped towards a demographic, here the content will be further narrowed to uniquely suit each listener. </p> <p>And while Capital is keen to stress this isn't a jukebox or CD substitute - all models that would compromise its relationship with the majors - it does mean unique content for each listener. </p> <p>Market research house Forrester sees the path to ubiquitous personalised internet radio happening in three stages. The next two years are still the PC era, with access remaining through your desktop computer. By 2004, the rise of broadband means we will see the dawn of a device era, with TV set top boxes and internet radios becoming more common. By 2005 and beyond, Forrester forecasts internet radios capable of being used anywhere, anytime, inside portable in-car radios and wireless MP3 players. They predict that 41% of the US population will tune in by that time. </p> <p>Certainly the development of internet car radios will boost usage, but the British area of growth is set to be mobile phones. </p> <p>Internet radio on your phone is already a reality. In August, Virgin Mobile launched the world's first MP3 phone which tunes into virgin.net's online radio broadcast. Users can also access its jukebox facility, listening to clips of 10 new tracks each week - and not just those acts who are signed to V2 records, either. If they like those tracks they can buy them directly using their mobile. </p> <p>Better is yet to come: while the Virgin MP3 phone now requires users to load digital audio files from home PCs, there will soon be phones with a permanent connection to the networks. </p> <p>By next spring, users will be able to download albums' worth of digital music from their personal collection, anywhere. Bored with the album you took to work on your phone, by lunch? You'll be able to replace it with a click of a button, over the air. </p> <p>And if your own collection is dull, with a permanent connection to the network, the multitude of internet radio stations will be just as near. </p> <p>Steven Day, a spokesman for Virgin Mobile, says: \"All of the other competitors in the UK mobile phone market have been talking about the things you can do with your phone for ages. None of them have ever done anything of note.\" </p> <p>You can be sure they are taking note now. </p> <p>All of which makes Aim's trial all the more important. Peter Quick, label manager for Aim member, Ninja Tune records, points out: \"We have to make sure that we don't end up with the same situation as America where there are no recording performance royalties. </p> <p>\"If you leave it for years without making a stand for copyright on internet radio, you'll make it increasingly likely that there won't be any.\" </p> <p>Ready, Aim?

  "<p><strong> Dance your way to freedom<br> Space Channel 5 </strong><br> Sega Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Sega ****<br> Slinky, sexy and stylish are some of the most underused words in a game reviewer's lexicon, but Space Channel 5 demands they be dusted off and reinstated. </p> <p>Quite simply this super-stylised dancing game is one of the treats of the autumn season. Starring space age newscaster Ulala (think Kate Adie crossed with Barbarella), your aim is to rescue hostages, and battle the Morolian alien scourge, by out-dancing them. Yep, this is the only game where Wayne Sleep would be more use than John Wayne. </p> <p>In a similar way to Bust-a-Groove ,you have to match the alien prompts - left, right, left, down, shoot, shoot - while keeping time to the beat. Be successful and not only will the hostages be saved, but your ratings will go through the roof.Display \"uncle at wedding reception\" co-ordination and the plug gets pulled. It sounds simple but as the pace quickens and the timing changes you'll curse your musical incompetence. </p> <p>But at least it looks good when you fail. Mixing 60s retro-futurism with Austin Powers kitsch, Space Channel 5 looks unlike any other game, with Ulalu particularly well animated. Combine all this with a splendid jazz funk soundtrack and you've got a recipe for mainstream success. </p> <p>Unfortunately there is the occasional button response problem with some presses going unregistered: a crucial problem in such a game. </p> <p>Also, like many Sega titles, this is a shortlived experience with only four levels to strut your funky stuff through. </p> <p>Still, unless your mouth has been surgically sealed, you'll be smiling while you're grooving and keep humming the soundtrack for months. It looks like Space Channel 5 just got another subscriber. (GH)</p> <p><strong> Goggles on for a runway success<br> Crimson Skies</strong> <br>PC \u00a329.99 Zipper/Microsoft ****<br> Nothing is guaranteed to send the casual gamer scrambling for the books section so much as the sight of a plane on the box. But stand firm, friends. Because although the Crimson Skies game engine owes more than a passing debt to Microsoft's aviation titles, it is actually a rollicking action adventure. </p> <p>It's a wonder no one thought of it before. Take the basic physics model and graphics engine from a flight sim, jazz it up a little, simplify the flying process, and add lashings of atmosphere. </p> <p>It's 1937 in an alternative US of A, torn apart by the pressures of Prohibition and the Wall Street Crash. You are Nathan Zachary, a dashing air pirate who, with his trusty squadron of privateers, seeks to exploit the chaos in a series of daring raids from his airborne HQ, the Pandora. </p> <p>There are 24 single-player missions in all, and you don't have to memorise a manual the size of Milwaukee to get cracking. The flying process has been simplified considerably, and stalling and blackouts are no longer an issue. Your only worry, given the average altitude of most missions, is staying clear of the ground. </p> <p>The simplified control system frees you up to concentrate on the dogfighting. Planes are customisable, with an arsenal of very un-1937 armaments to choose from; locations vary from 30s Manhattan to a Hollywood studio; missions include rescuing a pal from a moving train and stealing the plans to an enemy plane. For more of a challenge, there's a veritable fleet of multiplayer options, and play all takes place over beautiful, detailed environments. </p> <p>The stroke of genius here was basing the game on an existing comic strip. This gave the developers ready-made stories, characters and dialogue, and explains why Crimson Skies is so steeped in flavour. Plenty of effort, too, has been put into the pre- and post-game screens, cinematic sequences (such as fabricated newsreels), mission briefings, music, in-game radio banter and, most importantly, the plot. The result is a truly immersive experience that will take you right back to the glorious black-and-white heyday of Biggles and Flash Gordon. (AB) </p> <p><strong>Mr Driller's boring game</strong></p> <p><strong> Mr Driller</strong> </p> <p> Sony PlayStation \u00a320-25 Namco *<br> Namco claims that \"the main objective in Mr Driller closely follows\" Dig Dug, an arcade classic from 1982. The aim of the game is to drill down in a race against time, and that's the only real similarity. But while the gameplay is completely different, Mr Driller does capture the arcade spirit of the early 80s, and would have been a huge hit on the early Atari consoles. </p> <p>There is also a bit more to the game than appears at first glance. Susumu, the drilling character, quickly runs out of puff, so you have to pick up air capsules to stay alive. Also, the coloured blocks through which Susumu drills can join with other blocks of the same colour and, if there are four or more, disappear. This often makes the difference between progressing and being crushed to death by falling blocks that your tunnelling has undermined. </p> <p>Traps are formed by solid blocks that are restistant to Susumu's drill. (You can drill through an X block with five hits, but you lose 20% of your air.) </p> <p>As in cartoons, gravity does not act instantly, and you can try to outrun the consequences of your actions. This makes the gameplay more frenetic than the average puzzle game, though you don't get the growing tension that characterises the best examples of the genre, such as Tetris. </p> <p>The advantage it shares with other classic puzzlers is that the two-dimentional graphics and sound don't matter much. </p> <p>Mr Driller started as an arcade game and has been converted for Game Boy Color, Dreamcast and other formats. The Game Boy version - not tested - might be the one to buy, because the handheld format suits quick blasts. On more sophisticated consoles, Mr Driller looks a bit too thin to retain much interest, though it could well appeal to younger players. (JS)</p>",
  "<p>Britain's first personal video recorder (PVR), which uses technology that BBC director general Greg Dyke has predicted will change the TV industry forever, arrives in your local Dixons this week. </p> <p>The TiVo, made by Thomson and marketed by BSkyB, records on to an integrated 40 gigabyte hard drive and also allows you to pause and rewind live TV. </p> <p>It costs \u00a3400, plus a one-off payment of \u00a3200 (or \u00a310 a month) for access to an intelligent electronic programme guide that learns the user's viewing preferences and makes suggestions as to what they might like to record. It works with both digital and analogue TV systems. </p> <p>The introduction of TiVo in the US nearly two years ago generated acres of press coverage, largely on account of the TV companies' fears that users would never watch an advert again. Others, Dyke included, believe that once users have mastered the unit's electronic programming guide, traditional TV schedules will be jettisoned. </p> <p>Yet PVRs like TiVo and its rival in the US, Replay TV, have hardly captured the TV viewing public's imagination. </p> <p>Both TiVo and Replay went on sale in the US in early 1999. Since their launch, combined sales for both systems have been less than 100,000 units. Although industry pundits predict sales will reach around 400,000 by the end of the year, that's still very small beer in a nation of committed couch potatoes. That figure is made to look even more modest compared with the enormous take up in the US of DVD players. </p> <p>So will it fare any better over here? </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Sky's director of new product development Brian Sullivan believes so. He's banking on sales of up to 100,000 units in the first 18 months to two years of the product's life. He also feels that some of the reasons why sales have been sluggish in the US don't apply to the UK. </p> <p>\"In the US the product was clearly over-priced, with early units selling for $1,000. Also it was a new product category. Britons have been hearing about the product for two years now and are more aware of it than the Americans were when it launched over there.\" </p> <p>Sullivan is also believes that Britain is a nation of time-shifters. The TiVo box sports a facility called a Season Pass that will automatically record every episode of a particular programme. For a nation addicted to soaps it could prove to be a winning feature. </p> <p>The Sky/TiVo unit is unlikely to be the only PVR using hard disk storage on sale in the UK for long. Sky has already announced the spring arrival of XTV, an enhanced Sky Digital decoder that also features an integrated PVR manufactured in the UK by Pace Micro Technologies and NDS Technologies, part of the News International stable. The XTV unit will boast two digital tuners enabling, for the first time, Sky Digital viewers to watch one satellite channel while recording another. </p> <p>Other manufacturers, such as Nokia, Bush and Philips, have also unveiled prototype PVRs, though they are unlikely to reach the market until the companies have secured deals with broadcasters to programme information. </p> <p>One company the trio would dearly love to secure a deal with is ONdigital. In spite of constant speculation, including rumours of a tie-in with TiVo's rival Replay TV, the digital broadcaster has refused to give anything away. Company spokesperson Andrew Marre admits that \"personal video recorders are on the company's roadmap, but not for a long time and not at the kind of price Sky is charging\". </p> <p> The success of the TiVo box may hinge on whether a nation that still can't programme its VCRs can work its way round TiVo's operating system. </p> <p>Fortunately, the TiVo system is very simple to use. One click on the remote control brings up TiVo Central, the system's menu page. Recording a programme involves browsing the on-screen listings, which feature two weeks' worth of schedules at a time, finding what you want to record and clicking on it. Users can also use the system's search option to discover, for example, if a certain film will be shown in the next couple of weeks. </p> <p>But the search is limited to programme titles. An obvious enhancement for the MK II version would be a keyword search, so for example you could type in Coventry City, and all the programmes that mention the football club would flash up. </p> <p>Users are offered a choice of recording quality for the programme. On best quality, the hard drive will store up to 14 hours of programming. Using the lowest quality, the system can archive up to 40 hours of TV in a standard akin to long play mode on VCRs. </p> <p>Viewers can also rate the programmes they have recorded using the TiVo's thumbs up system. As the system develops a bank of information about the user's viewing habits, it begins to make suggestions as to programmes they might enjoy. It will also automatically record some programmes if it is confident that the user would not want to miss them. </p> <p>According to Sky's research the system's trump card could be its ability to pause live TV. Users can either continue to watch the programme from the point they stopped or return to seeing it in real time. Thanks to the unit's buffer system, users can also instantly jump back eight seconds, a feature sure to prove popular with sports fans looking for instant replays of controversial incidents. </p> <p>While there's no denying that the TiVo system is capable of some rather neat tricks, it is essentially a video recorder. So will the notoriously price-conscious British public be prepared to spend \u00a3600, when \u00a3250 buys a fairly sophisticated Nicam Stereo VCR? Sky's marketing team certainly has an interesting 12 months to look forward to. </p> <p><strong> How Tivo works</strong><br> Buy a TiVo system and you are in actually installing a mini PC under your TV. The box uses the Linux open-source operating system, contains a 50Mz Power PC processor and boasts a 40 gigabyte hard drive. </p> <p>To record programmes, the TiVo system takes the analogue signal from your TV aerial and using its MPEG encoder chip converts it into digital binary code which it then stores on its hard drive. When you want to watch the programme, it uses its MPEG decoder to change the digital stream back to an analogue one that is compatible with your TV set. </p> <p>The unit also features an integrated modem which has to be connected to your phone line - Sky supplies a splitter to save you installing a new line. </p> <p>Each night the modem makes a freephone online call to Sky to update the TiVo's electronic programme guide.</p>"
