  "While acknowledging that homosexuality should have been decriminalised, too many liberals still feel uncomfortable about homosexuals having care of children. <p>We need to recognise that this is a prejudice every bit as poisonous as the now-laughable claims, once happily peddled by the intolerant, that black people lacked intelligence or Jews were avaricious. It should be the needs of children, not the prejudices of other people, which determine their adoptive status </p> <p>On this occasion, young people do have something to teach us. In Channel 4's Big Brother series, a cross-section of diverse twentysomethings turned on one of their number as he trotted out the claim that homosexuality was connected with paedophilia. It should serve as a stark warning for Conservatives that anti-gay intolerance may no longer wash with electors under 30. </p> <p>However, it is not lost on lesbian and gays that this Government has not successfully piloted a single piece of legislation that has eased their situation. It relied on the European Court of Human Rights to require it to act on the age of consent and on gays in the military. It appears now to be doing the same on adoption. Meanwhile, thousands of young people grow up traumatised by prejudice towards the way they feel they were born. </p> <p>Tony Blair's failure in this field has given the infelicitous impression of his being cowed by the religious Right or opponents of homosexual equality in his own party, such as Government Chief Whip Ann Taylor. He should pledge that the next Labour Government will introduce a Homosexual Equality Bill, modelled on the Sex Discrimination Act, and save himself from a catalogue of embarrassing legislative skirmishes by having one battle head-on.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Guilty Victim - Austria from the Holocaust to Haider</strong><br> Hella Pick<br>IB Tauris \u00a324.50, pp246<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000241230,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Last month's decision by Austria's EU partners to lift the diplomatic sanctions imposed in protest against the presence in government of J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom Party was greeted in Vienna as a humiliating rebuff to the country's critics. Three 'wise men' appointed by the European Commission concluded that Austria had a better record towards asylum seekers and other immigrants than many of its European neighbours. And they praised the right-wing coalition's commitment to making amends to the Jewish victims of Austria's collaboration with Hitler.</p> <p>In this fair-minded, authoritative book, Austrian-born Hella Pick, former diplomatic editor of the Guardian, disentangles many widely held prejudices and clich\u00e9s about Austria to explain how an otherwise exemplary liberal democracy has fallen victim to a collective amnesia about its past. She pulls no punches in her condemnation of Austria's insistence that it was a victim of Hitler rather than a collaborator in the mass murder of the the Jews, but shows that others colluded in the myth. </p> <p>In 1943, Britain, the US and the Soviet Union declared that Germany's annexation of Austria in 1938 was an occupation, and named Austria as Hitler's 'first victim'. In the 10 years before it was granted full independence, the country became a key battleground in the Cold War. The West had no qualms about recruiting former Nazis as spies, and in their eagerness to bind Austria into the free-market system, were reluctant to antagonise with demands for speedy compensation for Holocaust victims. Pick quotes extensively from Austrian Cabinet minutes to highlight how the government decided to proceed as slowly as possible in returning to Austrian Jews the property that had been stolen from them during the war. </p> <p>From the mid-1960s until the revelations in 1985 about Kurt Waldheim's wartime past, Austria enjoyed the image of a model social democratic state. This image owed much to Bruno Kreisky, the charismatic Social Democratic chancellor who used Austria's neutral status to devise an activist foreign policy that attempted to build diplomatic bridges between east and west and between Israel and the Arab states. Pick makes no secret of her admiration for Kreisky but shows how his complex relationship with his own Jewish background, allied with a streak of political opportunism, prevented him from encouraging his fellow citizens to take a more candid look at their past. </p> <p>It was not until 1991 that Chancellor Franz Vranitzky finally acknowledged the state's responsibility for the participation of Austrians in the Nazi persecution of Jews. By this time, Haider had already started on the path to political success that led his party into government with the conservative People's Party in February. </p> <p>Unlike many of Austria's friends abroad, Pick does not attempt to play down the ugliness of Haider's xenophobic campaigns, and she dismisses as ludicrous his efforts to compare himself with Tony Blair. Much of Haider's success has been due to popular disenchantment with the cosy 'Proporz' system that shares out top jobs in both the public and the private sectors among supporters of the two big parties. </p> <p>In a passage of their report that Viennese officials have preferred to ignore, the European Commission's 'wise men' state that the sanctions against Austria have been effective in raising awareness about the country's past. Pick concludes that the Haider phenomenon may help Austria to complete the process.</p>",

To find out about the days before he met her, he goes to visit her first husband in the Nevada desert. He takes a gun with him. What may or may not happen then informs the rest of the novel. </p> <p>Dibdin has done some of his most cunning plotting and distinctive writing in his non-Zen novels: The Tryst was a haunting suspense novel with a remarkable ending; The Dying of the Light was an ingenious reworking of the Agatha Christie mystery.</p> <p>British but living in Seattle, Dibdin only seems to lose his footing when he sets his novels in the US, trying too hard to sound American. He piled it on strong in Dark Spectre. In Thanksgiving, too, he seems to aim for a genuine American voice, particularly curious since his narrator is English. But he is a master of ambiguity, and the elliptical narrative is both revealing and obscuring. Thanksgiving is a moving work and one that seems to indicate he is impatient with the confines of the mystery novel. </p> <p>While Dibdin has temporarily abandoned Italy, Iain Pears is back with <strong> The Immaculate Deception</strong>, his seventh Italian-based novel, featuring the newly married team of art historian Jonathan Argyll and Flavia di Stefano from the Italian art theft squad. </p> <p>Readers who know Pears's work only through his brilliant, complex historical mystery, An Instance of the Fingerpost, will be disappointed if they come to his new novel expecting something similar. These art-historical mysteries really fall into the high end of the crime category known as 'cosies', an often derogatory term used to describe cleverly plotted, entertaining but essentially unrealistic stories. But Pears writes with such wit and a deep knowledge of art and art history that as entertainment his series has few rivals. </p> <p>In The Immaculate Deception, di Stefano is summoned by the Italian prime minister to recover a painting that has been stolen for ransom. She must get it back without the theft becoming public and without paying a ransom. Argyll, meanwhile, is trying to track down the provenance of a renaissance painting hanging on the wall of di Stefano's old mentor, General Taddeo Bottando. </p> <p>The result is an intricately plotted, entertaining murder mystery. But having raised his game so much with Fingerpost, the hope is that Pears is working on something else of equal stature. </p> <p>American crime writer Tami Hoag has had great success over the past 12 years with a string of psychological thrillers. With <strong> Dust to Dust</strong>, she confirms that she can turn out a police procedural as gritty, grimy and engrossing as the best of them. </p> <p>Sam Kovac and Tinks Liska, her two Minneapolis protagonists, are tough and engaging and Hoag writes about their relationship in a fresh, believable way. Lead detective Kovac is the career cop who can't think of anything else to fill his life - 23 years in the job, jaded, but determined and unflinching. Liska, his younger sidekick, is feminine and forceful, a single parent whose nickname says it all - Tinks being short for 'Tinkerbell on steroids'. </p> <p>Together, they investigate the death of internal affairs investigator Andy Fallon. It's a case the top brass want closing quickly and quietly since Fallon was gay, he was investigating a possible police connection to the slaying of another gay cop and his own death looks like either suicide or accidental death by autoerotic misadventure. </p> <p>As in all the best mysteries, the present-day investigation leads to the past and the investigation of one death uncovers or provokes others. Kovac and Liska might be knowing but they are dogged in pursuit of the truth and optimistic about justice, even though, as Kovac says: 'Sometimes, it just takes a while to come around. And sometimes when it does, it's not quite what we had in mind.' </p> <p>Hoag is in a crowded procedural market but the quality of the writing make Dust to Dust a standout novel.</p>",
  "<p>'Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold.' There was an unforgettable moment in the Great Petrol Blockade when the Government's world tilted on its axis. </p> <p>The moment when impatience with the protesters visibly changed to panic came as it dawned on Ministers that what they were up against was not a trial of strength with organised power, whether trade unions (indeed, the impotence of the TUC is another abiding memory of the week), tight conspiracies of politically motivated men or public marches down Whitehall. </p> <p>Any of those they would probably have handled better than the baffling demonstration of 'weak' power, to which they had no answer. </p> <p>The strength of the self-employed hauliers, farmers and taxi drivers was precisely that they were unorganised. All the pleas, commands and threats were hollow rhetoric - who were they addressed to? Likewise there could be no deals struck in smoke-filled rooms because there was no one to negotiate with. The levers Ministers were pulling to reassert control were attached to nothing. </p> <p>It's a feeling they'll have to get used to. If it's not mere anarchy that's loosed upon the world, as in the Yeats poem, it's something nearly as bad for control-minded governments. </p> <p>As internet guru Esther Dyson told a packed seminar at London Business School last week: 'Things are two-way now. Readers are talking back to newspapers, vendors to buyers and citizens to governments. It's a very scary and confusing world out there.' </p> <p>Time was, says Dyson, when economies of scale required organisation, and the bigger the organisation the greater the scale. Not any more. </p> <p>Now the internet gives individuals virtual scale but without big-organisation dumbness: the slow wits, slow reactions and built-in tendencies to denial. It also allows them to talk back. </p> <p>On its own the enabling power of the internet would produce tremors in the old economy. But it coincides with another historic movement: the rise of human capital as the critical means of production. In the new economy, the supply of financial capital is no longer a problem. The supply of ideas and brainpower, however, is a very large issue. In fact, it's critical - and increasingly workers know it. </p> <p>In a recent Harvard Business Review article, 'Who wants to manage a millionaire?', the author notes that Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have learnt 'that millionaires come and millionaires go. The best you can do is to keep them while they still care'. </p> <p>Not everyone is a millionaire, of course. But they don't have to be - they just have to be independent, such as hauliers or taxi drivers. The result of internet-amplified individualism is a gathering shift in the balance of power. </p> <p>The fault lines are every where becoming evident. For example: </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Brands in disarray</strong>. Over the years companies with powerful brands have outperformed those with none. But from Gap to Coca-Cola, Levi's to Gillette, traditional standalone brands and their owners are in trouble. The reason: although brands are still important, says Dyson, in the age of customer talkback mass brands are becoming harder and more expensive to maintain. </p> <p>Others would say impossible. The internet sounds the knell for conventional brands, predicts Professor Alec Reed, who has set up an Academy of Enterprise to chart the emerging individual economy. By making price and other comparisons ever easier, the internet strips them of mystique and turns them into commodities. Mere 'image' counts for little in cyberspace. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Big firms on the defensive. </strong> In a recent Business Week survey, 72 per cent of Americans judged that corporations had too much power. A further 73 per cent hated the amount chief executives paid themselves, and 66 per cent thought companies were more interested in profits and share prices than providing good service. </p> <p>Opinion on its own, you might object, is cheap. But amplified by the internet, it comes dearer by the day. 'Companies can't just broadcast the official line any more,' notes Dyson. 'The internet is two-way. The unofficial story will out, too, and they can't control it.' Thus, consumer gripe sites such as eComplaints.com and Payusback.com are proliferating. The bad publicity can be devastating. Nike's travails over its labour policies are well known. Monsanto was destroyed as an independent company by consumer reaction to its GM products. </p> <p>Coca-Cola may live to regret the impounding of visitors' cans of Pepsi at the Sydney Olympics as it defended its legal exclusivity. </p> <p>In some cases, consumers are taking the revolt to the heart of a company's business. The music industry is unlikely to survive in its present form as its business model suffers sustained attack from both artists (mak ing music directly available on the net) and consumers ('sharing' music files via Napster and other MP3 sites). Both are taking savoured revenge for what they see as decades of industry indifference and exploitation. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Governments are losing control of their economies and their citizens.</strong> As Reed points out, when companies are globally mobile and location has more to do with the buzz of coffee houses and theatres than the building of factories, two things happen. Payment of corporate taxes increasingly becomes voluntary; and the ability to control where people live through regional policy, even indirectly, fades. </p> <p>Events such as the petrol blockades and the Seattle and Prague protests serve notice that the seeming inevitability of the forces of free markets and globalisation is nothing of the kind. The demonstrators sense they can be rolled back - even some economists argue they should be; that in some cases national solidarity and coherence have a value that outweighs obedience to free-market orthodoxy. </p> <p>So no wonder governments are in a funk and companies are running scared. What's slouching towards Davos, Prague and Seattle is a new order, with rules as different from those of the industrial age as sub-atomic physics is from the physical world that we see. The new order changes everything - including politics.</p>",
  "<p>The train is deserted. I can sit where I want and even spread out the papers and cuttings I intend to read on the way. My trip to the office has never been more pleasant. But there is a very good reason for this - it is not yet 6am. Having spent most of the night thinking about work rather than sleeping, I am cutting my losses and going in. </p> <p>That was a few years ago and I have changed my working practices and attitudes a lot since. At the time I would have said I had no choice as I was overworked, but I still remember the buzz I felt sitting on that empty train. That feeling, when I analysed it later, disturbed me. Was I becoming a work addict? </p> <p>Could this apply to you? </p> <p>The phrase 'work addiction' was not in our vocabularies when I made that trip to Waterloo, but there appears to be a lot of it about now. A survey conducted by the Institute for Personnel and Development shows that more than a million workers in Britain consider themselves 'addicted' to their jobs and voluntarily work extra hours. A third of these self-diagnosed addicts were self-employed. </p> <p>Adrian Cole is senior addiction therapist at the Priory Clinic, Bristol, and regularly treats work addicts. 'Addiction is a pathological relationship with an object or event, which means it can happen in any job,' he says. 'Although we see more men than women, it's not related to occupation or to how high up the ladder you are - we see the full range, from managing directors to technicians.' The clinic uses a 40-point questionnaire to assess a patient's degree of addiction. </p> <p>How many of the million in the IPD survey would be diagnosed as addicts by Cole? Perhaps more than you think. 'Work addiction is becoming more prevalent at the clinic,' he says, 'and like any other drug, it can, if pursued to its conclusion, be fatal. In Japan, 10 per cent of male deaths are work-related.' </p> <p>Addiction often manifests itself in long hours. In the IPD research, one in three of the people working more than 48 hours a week - the threshold under the Working Time Regulations - said they were addicted. But, says Cole, you don't need to be working all hours to be hooked. 'You may be working nine to five - but if all the time you're at home watching TV you're actually thinking about work, you need to think about what that means. We also see binge working, like binge drinking.' </p> <p>Comparisons with alcohol addiction go further. The Priory's treatment programme uses the first four of the famous 12 steps used by Alcoholics Anonymous. However, there is an important difference. 'Unlike alcohol addiction, we're not asking work addicts to give it up completely,' says Cole. 'That's not possible. The idea is to regain a healthy relationship with work. But while the act of not drinking may be difficult, the idea itself is simple. The ideas around work are more complex.' </p> <p>At the Priory, work addicts are admitted as either inpatients or outpatients to the treatment programme - four to five weeks of group sessions, videos and written work, including keeping a diary. 'Most people don't work while they are on the programme,' says Cole. 'But once they leave, some go back full-time, others part-time. Some retire. About 70 per cent will experience better lives as a result.' </p> <p>Cole believes all of us are potential addicts. 'Everyone likes to change the way they feel,' he says. 'When we find something that works for us, we go back to it. For some, it gets out of control. The point is that, initially, addiction works.' </p> <p>Work addiction is particularly insidious in this way. For a time it brings praise, promotion and higher pay. 'At first, work addiction is beneficial to the individual, their family, their company and society,' says Cole. 'But as returns diminish, addicts will strive even harder to chase that rainbow - even when deep down inside they know it isn't working.' </p> <p>Perfectionism, a need to be in control, low self-esteem and a preference for working alone rather than in teams are the classic character traits in work addicts. Cole is keen not to blame modern working culture - 'addicts use whatever is around; it's not new'. But when working practices exacerbate those characteristics, it is a cause for concern. </p> <p>Long hours, less job security and performance-related pay all make addiction easier to hide or to rationalise. Last year's Joseph Rowntree study, which showed that job insecurity had increased, also found a high correlation between poor general health and job insecurity. </p> <p>Nick Isles of the IPD says businesses gain nothing from overwork. 'When they work long hours, workers make mistakes and their relationships suffer,' he says. 'Businesses are realising that and we're seeing a backlash against the long-hours culture and presenteeism [being there to match or outdo colleagues' hours]. It's about working smarter, not longer.' </p> <p>Cole agrees. 'We have more and more companies coming here for seminars in healthy working. Work addicts are unproductive: no company wants that.' </p> <p>But Isles has a worry for the future: 'It's difficult to get the healthy working message over to self-employed people who love what they're doing.' 'Look at dotcom companies, for example.' This will be the IPD's next area of research, Isles says. </p> <p>But can you get addicted to addiction research? </p> <p>\u0095 There are 13 Priory hospitals in the UK. They take NHS and private patients and offer a free initial assessment to anyone who thinks they may be addicted. Call 0117 952 5255 for details. </p> <p><strong>Awkward questions to ask yourself</strong></p> <p> Do I regularly do any of the following things? </p> <p> \u0095 Get impatient in slow-moving queues </p> <p> \u0095 Find myself doing two or three things at once, such as eating lunch and writing a memo </p> <p> \u0095 Tend to put myself under pressure with self-imposed deadlines </p> <p> \u0095 Get upset with myself for the smallest mistake </p> <p> \u0095 Prefer to do things myself rather than ask for help</p> <p>These are five out of 25 questions asked of potential addicts (chosen simply because they struck a chord with me).

  "<p>You might not think it's as sexy as it was, but working in the City can still be a nice little earner for the right people. And it's the right people city firms will be seeking out at this year's Graduate Select recruitment fair organised by the University of London Careers Service (ULCS) and sponsored by The Guardian. </p> <p>This is the third year that the ULCS has run a fair aimed specifically at finding people for the big City players such as finance houses, management consultancies and IT firms. And sorry folks this one is not for everyone - this fair is picky. If you want to take a shot at pitching to the big boys, you have to apply online and be selected. </p> <p>Visit <a href=\"http://www.citykid.co.uk\">www.citykid.co.uk</a> and see if you have the right stuff to make the list of 1,000 graduates and undergraduates who will job-seek and rub shoulders with a bunch of blue-chips in London on October 23. </p> <p>This might be a fair for finance and related businesses but jobs are not reserved for the economists, mathematicians and assorted number-crunchers. People from all disciplines are welcome to apply. What the organisers of Graduate Select are looking for is quality all-rounders, usually with analytical skills and the ability to learn new skills. </p> <p>Organiser Joeley Irvine explains: \"Candidates are chosen for their outstanding academic records, work experience, IT skills and for demonstrating the motivation and drive to succeed at the highest level.\" </p> <p>Graduate Select is using a scoring system using these criteria: </p> <p>\u0095 A-level results </p> <p>\u0095 Degree awarded or expected </p> <p>\u0095 Foreign language skills - fluency in a second relevant language </p> <p>\u0095 IT skills - experience of basic business packages and, in some cases, programming. </p> <p>\u0095 Relevant work experience - internships or other useful experience in the financial or other relevant sector. </p> <p>\u0095 Extra-curricular achievements, leadership or teamwork experience, awards or prizes. Outstanding personal achievements. </p> <p>Candidates who can show outstanding knowledge and experience in relevant IT fields will be given special consideration and there will also be a non-scored section of the form for you to summarise your reasons for choosing this career path. Employers can use this to target preferred candidates. </p> <p>The employers are given details of all the preselected candidates. This means they have a good idea of what sort of skills you can offer and decide if they want to interview you at the fair or afterwards. </p> <p>\"The event will provide you with a chance to gain valuable information and make your first personal contact with top financial recruiters,\" says Irvine. </p> <p>As well as putting you in direct touch with top City firms, the fair offers an extensive seminar programme to provide you with in-depth information about the organisations you are interested in. </p> <p>And careers advisers from the University of London Careers Service will be on hand to give you advice about your CV and your applications. </p> <p>The Graduate Select Fair was created when the ULCS decided that since it was right next door to the City of London it was perfectly placed to organise a recruitment fair targeted specifically at its neighbour's needs. </p> <p>But the fact that the fair is in London and organised by the University of London does not mean it is restricted to local graduates. Anyone from anywhere can apply and putting in your application online makes it easier. Applications started in July and the deadline is October 11 - so there is a first-come, first-served element to the selection process. </p> <p>If you fancy making an application, check out the website to see who will be exhibiting, and do this regularly because some exhibitors may be added between now and the deadline. </p> <p>The names you will see include people like Arthur Andersen, The Bank of England, Coutts, Chase Manhatten, the Financial Services Authority, JP Morgan, PricewaterhouseCoopers, London Business School, Deloitte and Touche and, for the first time this year, Deutsche Bourse. </p> <p>This year's Graduate Select Fair has almost doubled in size from the first one and at the moment there are 27 exhibitors lined up to take part. </p> <p>Should any of the exhibitors look like the sort of business you would like to work for, visit the company website to take a closer look, not just to check them out, but to prepare yourself should you get past first base and get the Graduate Select go-ahead. </p> <p>\"If you are invited to attend the fair you will be given access to the web-based catalogue which you should read in detail to gain in-depth info on firms attending and on the careers in this sector,\" says Irvine. </p> <p>As with any fair, prepare your CV and bring several copies with you. Finally - while a bowler and brolly are not obligatory for this event, make some effort to dress smartly.</p>",

  "<p>To add your name to the wall of fame in the bar at Club La Santa, you need more than a marker pen and a penchant for post-alcohol graffiti sessions. In this purpose-built sporting complex on the north coast of Lanzarote, the qualifying standard is to be an Olympic champion, a world champion or world- record holder. You also need a signed photograph. </p> <p>Entry criteria for the rest of the resort is, fortunately, far lower - open to anyone, in fact. What makes La Santa unique is that while a host of sports stars are shining under the watchful eyes of their coaches, any vaguely- sporty type can share the very same sessions and facilities. You just have be up for an active break and, depending on the time of year, be ready to pay slightly more than you would for a regular self-catering package holiday. Once that's done, use of all equipment, tuition and competition entry (for those that want it) is free. </p> <p>No fewer than 63 of the medal winners from the last Olympics trained at La Santa. Regulars are Benetton's Formula One drivers, national rugby and cricket teams, rising stars of track and field, such as Linford Christie's group of young sprinters, and retired greats such as Frank Bruno and Daley Thompson. Yet the atmosphere is anything but intimidating - an essential part of any training programme is rest and recovery, and there are ample opportunities for both. </p> <p>Anyone of any shape, size or state of fitness can sign up for one of the many exercise or relaxation classes, which take place all day, every day in the open-air aerobics areas. Start with an early-morning stretch session, head out for a run or power walk, take lessons in the Olympic-size pool, pump iron in the gym or practise racket, ball and cycle skills. Or simply read and relax. </p> <p>There's professional coaching on hand from the \"Green Team\"- who also look after the kids for you if required. There are even security guards patrolling to keep the noise down and ensure that everyone gets a good night's sleep. </p> <p>This may be the Rodeo Drive of fit bodies, but if it's reassurance you're after, watching them tuck into large post-training plates of chips and mayonnaise at the pool bar should make you feel a lot better. </p> <p><strong> What to do</strong><br> </p> <p> Sport, sport and more sport, plus all that goes with it - massage, physiotherapy, sports psychology, tuition, sleeping, sunbathing, eating, drinking. Evening entertainment includes live music and cabaret shows, theme nights and parties, plus a cinema with English films. </p> <p>Apart from the extensive daily programme of activities, which take place all year round, La Santa organises tournaments, training camps and instruction weeks, which usually take place under the guidance of present and former international sports stars, but are available to participants of all levels. Examples of specialist weeks include cycling, aerobics, badminton, tennis, swimming, yoga, adventure walking and London Marathon preparation. </p> <p>There's a competitive element for those who want it - La Santa hosts the Lanzarote Ironman Triathlon in May as well as a number of 10K races and marathons. </p> <p>For those after a different sort of therapy, shops on site include a fashion boutique and a hairdressing and beauty salon. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong><br> </p> <p> More than 250 years ago, a massive volcanic eruption transformed Lanzarote into a lunar landscape. There's a law to preserve the natural beauty of the island: buildings over three stories high are prohibited and the outside walls must be white with green, brown or blue doors and shutters, symbolising the cultivated earth, the volcanoes and the sea. </p> <p>The La Santa Guides Department can arrange excursions to different parts on the island, such as the 14km Ruta De Los Vulcanos in the National Park of Timanfaya. There's also a mountain bike trip around the small island of La Graciosa in the north; a catamaran cruise along the coastline looking for dolphins, whales and flying fish; camel and surf safaris; and trips to the local markets. </p> <p>Eruptions (the last was in 1824) have left behind a series of caves. One of the biggest and most beautiful is Jameos Del Agua, which now houses a restaurant and tourist centre. The Caves of The Green People (Los Verdes) served as a refuge to the natives of the island against the pirate attacks and slave hunters, and a section about a kilometre in length is open to visitors.La Casa de los Volcanes is a volcanic research centre where you can observe earth temperature and movements. </p> <p><strong> Where and what to eat</strong><br> </p> <p> Most people stock up at the on-site supermarket and cater for themselves in the apartments. There are also three restaurants at the resort: Atl\u00e1ntico is a self-service affair where half-board guests eat morning and evening buffets. La Bodega has a family-minded menu, while La Casa is \u00e0 la carte and offers international cuisine and traditional Canarian dishes, tapas and vegetarian meals. The pool bar offers light lunchtime snacks. </p> <p>For more traditional fare, head out to the surrounding villages. Lanzarote is good for fish and shellfish, such as limpets, winkles ( burgados ) or mussels. Look out for sundried fish (jareados) or sardines and tuna from the Sahara banks, together with papas arrugadas (wrinkled potatoes) and the famous mojos, a spicy sauce made from a mixture of oil, vinegar, garlic and different spices. </p> <p>Kid, goat and pork leg, are local specialities, while tra ditional basics include potato stew, sancocho (salted fish casserole), fish soup, chickpeas and goat and sheep's cheeses. </p> <p> Frangollo is the king of the sweets, made with corn flour, eggs, milk, almonds, raisins and served with honey or condensed milk. Bienmesabe or truchas stuffed with sweet potato, pumpkin or vermicelli are also worth a try if you're sweet of tooth. </p> <p><strong> How much?</strong><br> </p> <p> From \u00a3272 per person including flights and airport transfers, based on three people sharing a self-catering apartment for a week in January. All sport free. Accommodation only (subject to availability) or full package deals available. Special equipment such as bikes or surf boards are charged for by the airlines at the airport. </p> <p><strong> How to get there</strong><br> </p> <p> Flights to Arrecife from most regional airports, although prices are based on charters from Gatwick, so others may carry a supplement. Bus transfer to La Santa. </p> <p><strong> How to book</strong><br> </p> <p> Contact <a href=\"http://www.clublasanta.co.uk\">www.clublasanta.co.uk</a>, e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:reservations@clublasanta.co.uk\">reservations@clublasanta.co.uk</a>, or Sportstours International, 91 Walkden Road, Walkden, Worsley, Manchester M28 7BQ, tel: 0161-790 9890, fax: 0161-790 9811.</p>",
  "<p>'I went down to the crossroads/ And fell down on my knees./ Asked the Lord up above: 'Have mercy,/ Save poor Bob if you please'.\" </p> <p>The legend has it that Robert Johnson, the tortured but brilliant blues singer, went down to the crossroads and sold his soul to the devil in exchange for what must have been one of the greatest guitar lessons of all time. The crossroads are where Highways 49 and 61 meet in deepest Mississippi. </p> <p>In African folklore, Esu, guardian of the crossroads, is an intermediary between gods and humans; he must have come over to the cotton plantations in a slave ship, mistaken for the devil. Whatever transpired that dark and steamy night, there's no doubt that this is the home of the blues - devil's music to most white folk of the time. </p> <p>It's not a long ride from Johnson's crossroads, where the dog's still howl at night, the heat is oppressive and the stars shine like the sun flicking off chromed fenders, to the old Stovall Plantation on the edge of Clarksdale. Here you'll still find the ruins of the timber cabin Muddy Waters grew up in. </p> <p>\"Muddy took the music of the Delta plantation,\" says Eric Clapton, \"transplanted it in a Chicago nightclub, surrounded it with an electric band, and changed the course of popular music forever.\" </p> <p>Just about. What's missing from Clapton's mix is the other sounds that Mississippi spawned, which spun together to form rock'n'roll, pop and just about every sound, techno aside, that leaps from radios and stereos worldwide today. </p> <p>There's Clarksdale's other stars, Howlin' Wolf, Son House, John Lee Hooker, Ike Turner and Sam Cooke, but the missing link is Elvis Aron Presley, a white country boy from Mississippi (\"My grandma used to pick cotton alongside Elvis,\" says the check-out clerk in Tupelo's Billion Books store). </p> <p>Elvis, said his first producer Sam Philipps of Sun Records, Memphis, \"sang like a black man\". The two cultures were acceptably joined at a wiggling hip and the records sold like hotcakes. </p> <p>Elvis was born in Tupelo ... </p> <p>\"Tupelo ... Tupelo,/ Everybody's welcome down in Tupelo/ Birthplace of Elvis Presley, the King of rock'n'roll/ The Tupelo symphony will thrill your musical soul/ There's blues and country music, bluegrass and gospel too/ And everybody's listening to good ol' fiddle-tee\" [insert barn- dancing fiddle break here]. </p> <p>That was Buddy and Kay Bain, erstwhile stars of TV's Mornin' with Buddy and Kay. With an oddball gang of Americans and Brits, I went to the Elvis Presley Festival in good ol' Tupelo; we sang this yee-hi song with Kay herself in the parking lot of Estes Fish House on a bellyfull of deep-fried this, that and whaddyagot. No question about it, Tupelo, like much of Mississippi is a friendly place. </p> <p>God knows what lurks behind its big, toothy-grinned smile, but the \"southern welcome\" is real enough. This steamy, underpopulated, agricultural state wandering up from the Gulf of Mexico to the Tennessee River along the mighty Mississippi remains, for many outsiders, the stuff of rednecks and lynching, racism and Mississippi Burning, of gun culture and the Ku Klux Klan. </p> <p>The times, though, are a changing. My Mississippi trail was a hot (95-100F), slow shoe-shuffle through the landscape of the blues and country music, bluegrass and gospel too. And, of course, rock'n'roll. </p> <p>That story begins, as much as it begins anywhere, in good ol' Tupelo. This small, sun-scorched city has been home to the annual Elvis Presley Musical Festival for two years now, attracting something like 35,000 people both times, but, as yet, very few tourists from outside the US, or the Confederacy as I far as I could detect from the accents. </p> <p>\"I ain't got no accent,\" says a local ma-an (ie man, but any word worth its weight in catfish here has more than one syllable). </p> <p>The festival is held, outdoors of course, in the parking lot alongside the hardware store where Elvis's mum, Gladys, brought him his first guitar (the future king of rock'n'roll had asked, as you do in Mississippi, for a gun). And just down the road from the school where, accompanied by that first guitar, Elvis won second prize in a talent competition with a tear-jerking rendition of Ol' Shep, a song about a hound dog. It dies. </p> <p>And we know they cried, because you can't turn a crossroads in Tupelo without being introduced to one of Elvis's old school mates, or Scotty Moore, who played lead guitar on That's Alright Mama back in 1954, Elvis's oldest friend Becky Martin, who invites me home to look at old photos, or Presley cousins galore. Cousin Willy sings a rueful rendition of Blue Moon of Kentucky at Estes Fish House. And who's this down at the town's County Jail to greet us, but none other than Sherriff Harold Ray Presley. </p> <p>You get to meet and hear Elvis impersonators at the festival. Here's Ronnie McDowell backed by Scotty Moore, and Elvis's drummer D J Fontana. Here's Travis LeDoyt who does young Elvis down to a fried peanut butter and banana sandwich. It could almost have been Elvis himself up on the stage. The King returned to play Tupelo big-time after Heartbreak Hotel hit number one in 1956 and even though he had gone to live at his Liberace-style mansion, Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee, some three hours drive north. </p> <p>First thing he did when he had his big hit was to buy an open-top Ford and drive home to take his pals out to Johnnie's Drive-In on East Main Street. It's still here. A neon-framed cabin where men with arms the size of your waist sit down to dine in denim dungarees, where the pony-tailed waitress is the stuff of Hollywood dreams and the pie is a la mode, and much more. Closed Sundays; the sign reads \"Gone to church\". As do most folks in Mississippi. </p> <p>There are places of worship at every turn. It would be a miracle if you could squeeze a bible between two of them. Linda, Roy, Jeannine and me went to the Good News Church on West Jackson Street. \"Welcome in the name of Jesus, brother.\" </p> <p>Everybody's welcome down in Tupelo, as at Estes Fish House, as in the House of God. The service was one of the best soul and gospel gigs I've been to. No disrespect. \"If only religion had been as fun as this,\" Jeannine said to me above the funkiest rendition of Amazing Grace you've ever heard, \"we'd be saints by now.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Elvis festival rocks on, with Dr Zarr's Amazing Funk Monster, the Mississippi Mass Choir and live music in wired-up bars. Big-haired barflies out sluttin' for the night. More piss-poor beer than you'd ever want to drink. Guys with long grey hair picking Fenders and Gibsons, although the music shops here sell nothing but Yamaha guitars and electric pianos. Where, I couldn't help thinking were the 12-string, rhinestone-set, semi-acoustic Gretches, the whirring Hammonds of yesterday? </p> <p>Back in your motel, the crickets, bigger than a Cadillac, bigger even than your TV, are singing in your room. Twelve - I counted them all out - hopped lazily from a shirt I'd left draped across my ba-ag. But, then, the whole level Mississippi landscape from the Delta and up to Memphis across the border in Tennessee, is alive with the sound of crickets, frogs and man-made music from every passing truck and car. Yet, there are havens where the music is turned down low and an older, grander culture than popular music prevails. </p> <p> W e stop in Oxford, a delightful university town based around a real arcaded square rather than lined along \"strips\" like good ol' Tupelo. The bookstore here is about as good as they get. The caf\u00e9s are fine, the clothes shops a zoo of snakeskin, rhinestone and sequins sewn up the sides of slits and slashes. </p> <p>We eat takeaway deep-fried pickles. \"We'd deep-fry our grandmothers if it was legal,\" suggests Roy. </p> <p>The architecture drifted by as we headed upstate to the sounds of Matreca Berg, the Dixie Chicks, Faith Hill and Johnny Lang to Holly Springs, a town that hosts dozens of supremely-elegant neoclassical clapboard houses and Phillips Grocery which is said to serve the \"finest hamburger in America\" (or so says USA Today). </p> <p>Well, it was mighty fine, but finer still is the setting that, like so many in Mississippi, looks as if it hasn't changed much since the birth of rock'n'roll. A big shack of a building standing by a yard full of lumbering freight trains. Big Coke machine. Big burgers. Big fries. Big, big heat. Mississippi burning. August isn't the month to go way down in Dixie; in fact the Elvis festival, timed to coincide with the King's untimely collapse on a toilet seat in Graceland, is likely to move to the fall next year. </p> <p>We crossed the state boundary into Tennessee, to Memphis and Sun Studios where rock'n'roll took off and where you can cut your disc, burn your own CD for $75 an hour. Just like Elvis. Despite the heat - by now my brain was deep-fried - I wanted to turn around and do it all over again. The Delta. The legends. The music. Meeting astonishingly generous people with a lust for life. And getting deeper under the deep-fried skin of this enigmatic state. Not forgetting Tupelo: \"Now in this friendly city down in Dixieland/ Y'all come to see us anytime you can/ When you're in the southlands and you want some place to go/ Y'all come down to visit us in good ol' Tupelo.\" </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong></p> <p> Delta Vacations (0870 900 5001) organises seven-night fly-drive holidays to Tennessee and Mississippi, flights London Heathrow to Memphis from \u00a3315, fully-inclusive basic car hire from \u00a3189, per week.

  "<p><strong>Friday September 1</strong><br> Citing Bodyline and the Kerry Packer era, former Indian selector <strong>Sambaran Bannerjee</strong> expresses his belief that cricket will survive its latest controversy. \"The match-fixing controversy has damaged the image of cricket. However, I sincerely believe that this is temporary. Cricket has survived many other controversies. It will also come out of this.\"</p> <p><strong>Saturday September 2</strong><br> India exclude <strong>Mohammad Azharuddin, Ajay Jadeja, Nayan Mongia</strong> and <strong>Nikhil Chopra</strong> - all of whom may face match-fixing charges - from their provisional 23-man squad for the ICC Trophy tournament in Kenya. The Daily Telegraph suggests that Hansie Cronje may have received as much as \u00a3100,000 by South African television company M-Net for talking about his demise.</p> <p> <strong>Sunday September 3</strong><br>BCCI secretary <strong>Jaywant Lele</strong> says that match-fixing in India is \"not possible.\" He also dismisses alleged statements made by himself in Manoj Prabhakar's video tapes: \"I did not tell him anything. He has made it all up himself. It's all unauthorised, unethical and not acceptable.\"</p> <p> <strong>Sir Richard Hadlee</strong> urges players and officials to protect cricket from further problems. \"We can never accept bribery and match fixing. The players, administrators as well as cricket lovers are the custodians of the game. It is our responsibility to guard the game against such scandals.\" Kent coach <strong>John Wright</strong> is rumoured to be about to replace Kapil Dev as Indian coach.</p> <p> <strong>Monday September 4<br>AC Muthiah</strong>, president of the BCCI, says that a decision on the future of Kapil Dev will be announced shortly. \"I will announce the decision a week before the conditioning camp [for the provisional squad selected for the ICC Trophy tournament at Nairobi] begins in Chennai on September 14.\" </p> <p> <strong>Tuesday September 5</strong><br> PCB chairman Lt Gen Tauqir Zia confirms that <strong>Salim Malik</strong> has been asked to confirm whether he is to instigate court proceedings in an attempt to overturn the life ban afforded him in the Qayyum report. \"What he was supposed to tell us was whether he plans to challenge the decision or not. In his reply, he has not responded to this. The PCB has written him a fresh letter directing him to be precise and stay on track. He has been asked whether he intends to go to the court of law or not.\" </p> <p><strong>Wednesday September 6</strong><br> The Sindh High Court orders eight Pakistani cricketers - <strong>Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Salim Malik, Saeed Anwar, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Akram Raza, Mushtaq Ahmed</strong> and <strong>Ata-ur-Rehman</strong> - to appear before it on September 25. The summons is in connection with a citizen's petition calling for the players to be banned from the game and prosecuted over match-fixing. </p> <p><strong>Thursday September 7</strong><br>The CBI finally question <strong>Kapil Dev</strong> about allegations made by Manoj Prabhakar that Dev had tried to bribe him to underperform in a Singer Cup match in Sri Lanka 1994. He is one of the last people to be questioned by the CBI, who are to submit an interim report on their investigations shortly. </p> <p>Salim Malik's lawyer <strong>Shahid Hamid</strong> says that his client's life ban was not legally imposed and he is ready to challenge it. \"To the best of my knowledge Malik is not in receipt of any order of Pakistan Cricket Board imposing on him the punishment recommended in Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum's report. PCB served a show-cause notice on Malik asking him why recommendations of Justice Qayyum be not imposed and Malik has given a detailed reply and gave reasons why the punishments be not imposed. Personal hearing is [Malik's] right so that he can clarify his side.\"</p> <p>CBI officials have an informal meeting with <strong>Sachin Tendulkar</strong> in Mumbai, in which he is asked for his opinion on a number of matters, including the atmosphere in the dressing-room, relationships between players, and whether outsiders were found in the dressing-room on a regular basis.</p> <p>Having been questioned by the CBI, <strong>Kapil Dev</strong> says that he is \"very happy and relieved. I will be able to sleep well tonight.\"</p> <p><strong>Friday September 8</strong><br> Sources close to the CBI suggest that their interim report into \"an exhaustive picture of corruption\" is likely to be released on September 29. </p> <p>Reports suggest that this report will implicate two English cricketers, and three Pakistanis, who have apparently been exposed by CBI investigations.</p> <p>BCCI selection committee chairman <strong>Chandu Borde</strong> suggests that the match-fixing investigation should be expedited to restore the image of the game. \"Cricket stands maligned after the match-fixing scandal and spectators have become suspicious about the game. If cricket in the country has to restore its lost glory, match-fixing cases should be solved immediately.\"</p> <p>On rediff.com, <strong>R N Savani</strong>, the joint director of investigations for the CBI, says that the agency is debating asking <strong>Manoj Prabhakar</strong> to undergo a lie-detector test. \"This might become necessary as all those who had been summoned as witnesses at the instance of Prabhakar have refused to testify in his favour. We have now examined Kapil Dev as well and there is no-one else who can tell us more. We have been on the job since May this year and now we want to know if there is any truth in these allegations or someone has sent the CBI on a wild-goose chase. There is no way we can find this out unless we ask Prabhakar to undergo a lie-detector test.\"</p> <p><strong>Saturday September 11</strong><br> The Indian Minister of State for Sports, <strong>Shahnawaz Hussain</strong>, says that it is not just players who are likely to be affected by the CBI's imminent report. \"Many icons of Indian cricket could fall from the pedestal once the CBI wraps up its probe into betting and match-fixing in the game. Besides the superstars of the game, the CBI report is also likely to point an accusing finger at some other bigwigs associated with the game.\"</p> <p><strong>Sunday September 10</strong><br> In The Sunday Telegraph, <strong>Det. Supt Steve Gwilliam</strong>, the head of the Scotland Yard probe into allegations of bribery made by <strong>Chris Lewis</strong>, says that he would be \"very surprised\" if two English players were to be named in the CBI interim report. \"I know absolutely nothing about this at all. I'd be very surprised if this was true bearing in mind that we do talk to the Indians regularly.\"</p> <p>BCCI secretary <strong>Jaywant Lele</strong> reasserts his belief that the integrity of the spine of the Indian team should stop the match-fixing problem breaking the back of Indian cricket. \"Saurav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and Javagal Srinath are free from any allegations and the Indian team is safe in their hands.\" He also reiterates that any player found guilty of match-fixing will be banned for life.</p> <p><strong>Sunil Gavaskar</strong> echoes Lele's sentiments at a function in Mumbai. \"Just as one corrupt policeman will not make the entire department corrupt and one corrupt journalist would not put the entire media into shame, one shady cricketer could not bring darkness into the world of cricket.\"</p> <p><strong>Tuesday September 12</strong><br>Despite speculation that he is to be replaced as Indian coach, <strong>Kapil Dev</strong> is asked to take charge of the Indian team at their preparatory camp in Chennai on September 14. BCCI president <strong>AC Muthiah</strong> says that, \"the BCCI's stand that it will not take any action on players or administrators, unless they were proved guilty, will remain.\"</p> <p> <em>But later on the same day...</em><br><strong>Kapil Dev</strong> resigns as coach of India. In a letter to BCCI president <strong>AC Muthiah</strong>, Kapil said, \"I was waiting to be cleared by the investigating agencies before I gave in my resignation as I did not wish it to look like some kind of admission of guilt. Even though I know the investigation report will be submitted only later this month, unfortunately I cannot wait until that happens as the [preparatory] camp for our boys [ahead of the ICC Knockout Tournament in Kenya next month] begins in two days and I would not like to start a job I will not finish.\"</p> <p><strong> Jaywant Lele</strong>, secretary of the BCCI, expresses his surprise at Kapil's resignation. \"We were not expecting it, especially after we sent him a letter asking him to proceed to Nairobi for the ICC Knockout tournament between October 3 and 15.\" Kapil is to be replaced on a temporary basis by former opening batsman, and his predecessor as coach, <strong>Anshuman Gaekwad</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday September 13</strong><br>In <em>The Times of India</em>, Kapil Dev says that cricket has been \"murdered\" and criticises his treatment by the BCCI. \"The game that gave me everything has now taken its pound of flesh from me. I have taken what came to me, but I would request the Board to be kinder to the next coach and give him his due respect, if they have the welfare of the game at heart. This is not a battle of flexing our muscles. The game which has been murdered has to slowly be brought back to life.\"</p> <p><strong>Friday September 15</strong><br><strong>Manoj Prabhakar</strong> says that he is ready to take a lie-detector test, but that he should not be alone in doing so. \"I am ready to take [the test], but only on the condition that the other people involved in the controversy also take it. Why should I be the only one to take the test? I would like all of them to sit there when I take the test and ask me questions. And then I would like to sit through their questioning and have them answer my questions too. I think that is quite fair. And I don't think anybody should say no if they believe they have been honest all the while.\"</p> <p>New Indian coach <strong>Anshuman Gaekwad</strong> calls on the media to help restore cricket's integrity. \"I have had a word with the boys, and I have told them that along with trying to win, we also have the duty of trying to clean up our tarnished image. They have agreed and are prepared to do it. And to do that, I sincerely believe that I need the help of the media a great deal. The media is responsible to a great deal in causing the situation and now we have to rectify it together. See, look at it my way - cricketers will come and cricketers will go, but if cricket as a game dies, there'll be no return.\"</p> <p><strong>Saturday September 16</strong><br> CBI director <strong>RK Raghavan</strong> says the agency are \"burning midnight oil\" to submit their interim report as quickly as possible.

  "<p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> <a href=\"http://www.postmodern.com/~fi/pattipics/images/only.jpg\" target=\"_NEW\">View the work online</a></p> <p> <strong>Artist:</strong> Robert Mapplethorpe (1946-89), the photographer whose studies of male anatomy in extreme sexual situations made him the bete noire of cultural conservatives in the 1980s. Since his death from Aids he has been recognised as a great. His images of flowers and famous faces adorn calendars and museum walls with an instantly recognisable cold grace. </p> <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Patti Smith, New York beat legend, celebrated for punk records from her first spoken-word rant Piss Factory (1974) and debut album Horses (1975) to her recent comeback recordings. </p> <p><strong>Distinguishing features:</strong> Smith looks as if she were a madonna carved in white marble in a northern Renaissance church. The shadows are so deep, and her thin presence so stark, that her flesh seems to be cool stone. She is alive, like the surface of a Michelangelo marble. Smith has tremendous force, black anger in the white light. </p> <p>This is an image so solid, a composition so insistent, that it is hard to believe that Mapplethorpe took this picture with nothing more than a Polaroid camera. The dead-on look she gives the camera also mimics the most brutal kind of photographic portrait, the passport or police mugshot. The sensuous severity of the image is presented as if it were nothing, just an accident in a picture taken without thought. </p> <p>Smith and Mapplethorpe were living together in Manhattan at the time, and Smith was starting to emerge as a performer. Mapplethorpe had been making rough-and-ready collages with a religious quality; he came from a Catholic background and constantly returned to the idea of an altarpiece, as well as taking an intense pleasure in blasphemy. Mapplethorpe started taking Polaroid photographs for his collages, and these have an instant charm that is very different from the majesty of his late black-and-white photographs - but contain very much the same subject matter. He photographed friends' faces, his face, genitals, sado-masochist games. And Patti. </p> <p>The relationship between Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe is shrouded in ambiguity; according to Mapplethorpe's biographer Patricia Morrisoe, Smith was shocked when she discovered the true nature of his sexuality. </p> <p>Whatever is said about Mapplethorpe, this picture exposes what he really was: a romantic. He has photographed Patti Smith as the essence of every romantic icon, a savage heart on a highway to hell. Dark, shadowed and desperate, she burns herself into the picture. </p> <p>Mapplethorpe's picture summons up myths of the outsider artist and confers on the nascent punk star a romantic character developed by painters since the 19th century. Mapplethorpe's pictures played an important part in shaping her fame; he also took the picture that appears on the cover of her 1975 album Horses. </p> <p>Inspirations and influences: \"I spent five minutes glancing through his images looking for allusions to other works of art,\" wrote the critic David Hickey of Mapplethorpe. \"I came up with Leonardo, Correggio, Raphael, Bronzino, Caravaggio, Ribera, Vel\u00e1zquez, Chardin, Reynolds, Blake, Fantin-Latour, and a bunch of photo guys.\" His pictures are saturated with a sense of art history, but the inspiration for his early work may have been Warhol's use of low-effort photography. With their apparent casualness and randomness of content, they are a visible influence on Turner-nominated photographer Wolfgang Tillmans. </p> <p><strong>Where is it?</strong> Asprey Jacques Gallery, 4 Clifford Street, London W1 (020-7287 7675), till November 18.</p>",
  "<p>John Vickers is the new consumers' champion. The new director general of fair trading is prepared to take on anything from dodgy secondhand car dealers to multinational corporations. It is this Harry Potter lookalike who will ensure the consumer is not being ripped off. After two years at the Bank of England helping to set the nation's interest rates, Mr Vickers explains that his new job to bust cartels and prevent monopolies is not just an unattainable utopia dreamt up by academics - like himself. </p> <p>\"An important ingredient in getting a good deal is being in a situation where there's rivalry between those who want to sell to you. So I think competition isn't some sort of lofty end in itself,\" he says. </p> <p><strong> Strictly business</strong><br> </p> <p> Oxford-educated and a former professor of economics at All Souls College, Vickers sees \"practical, pragmatic, prudent\" reasons for ensuring that companies are forced to behave competitively. And he will have more powers than any of his predecessors to ensure they do. His manner is strictly business: he is quick to deny a funny anecdote regarding a college ritual involving a duck. </p> <p>Vickers will be the first \"DGFT\", as staff refer to the director general, to levy potentially hefty fines against offending companies. As much as 10% of a company's turnover for three years, the first could be handed out within weeks of him taking office when cases initiated by his controversial predecessor, John Bridgeman, reach their conclusion. </p> <p>Under the new competition act which came into force in March, Vickers also has the power to prevent companies abusing their market power. To encourage cartel-busting, he will be able to grant amnesties to companies which snitch on their cohorts. But other increases to his powers look threatened by the apparent decision to leave a new consumer rights bill out of the Queen's speech at the start of the next parliament. </p> <p>The government has also put procedures in place to keep his powers in check. The Department of Trade and Industry is taking views on setting up a board to run the OFT. </p> <p>Vickers, a surprise choice for the \u00a3170,000 a year role, insists he is \"supportive\" of a plan which would also require the OFT to publish the minutes of case discussions at the board meetings. \"It will bring a variety of perspectives to the OFT and its decision makers,\" says Vickers, who has experience of the controversy over the publication of minutes from his tenure on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. </p> <p>The son of an Eastbourne handbag retailer is steadfast in his refusal to discuss monetary policy. For the record, the studious 42-year-old was one of the hawks who argued unsuccessfully for a rise in interest rates in August to keep inflation in check. </p> <p>Vickers maintained a low profile in his time as the Bank's chief economist, allowing Mervyn King, who did the job before his promotion to deputy governor, to take the leading role. Even when King gave him the opportunity for a swansong at his final media briefing, Vickers declined and let King do the talking. </p> <p>In his new role it will be tougher for him to lurk in the shadows. He is taking on a position which took six months to fill. As Bridgeman found to his cost, the job regularly pitches the OFT against government. It is widely believed that Vickers is filling a job which the incumbent was forced to relinquish after disagreeing with the government's \"rip off Britain\" campaign. </p> <p>Not willing to react to the rumours, Vickers deftly sidesteps the issue and credits Bridgeman with transforming the OFT. He compares it to the MPC, which he also joined just as it started to increase its transparency. </p> <p><strong> Real independence</strong><br> </p> <p> \"The key to what's happening with monetary policy is that there's a clearly independent monetary policy committee which is seen to be independent. The credibility of the arrangement depends in a large part on that independence,\" says Vickers. </p> <p>The same is true of his new role. \"I am, and the OFT is, independent,\" he says. This stand, he points out, must be seen to be real to make the office work effectively. He is reluctant to discuss specifics of the caseload which he inherits on Monday morning. His first day coincides with the start of a potentially high profile OFT attempt to smash the price fixing agreements of over-the-counter medicines such as Lemsip and Nurofen. </p> <p>These items, found in millions of medicine cabinets around the country, are the only ones left in the UK where manufacturers and suppliers can legally set minimum resale prices to the public. The arrangement, granted 30 years ago, is less well known than that for books which was abandoned so publicly three years ago. </p> <p>The case, to be heard in the restrictive practices court, follows a five year investigation by the competition authority. As it begins, news of the OFT's decisions on supermarket pricing and the \"beer orders\" - including moves to put full measures in pubs - is eagerly awaited. The OFT is already working on the \"professions\", such as accountancy and the law, and on motorway services after complaints from consumers about prices and quality. </p> <p>Vickers thinks such investigations should take place in a European and international context. EU rules are already influencing the OFT, particularly over the scrutiny of \"unfair terms\" in contracts with consumers. Europe's human rights rules also keep the OFT in check while the globalisation of business means that healthy relationships need to be maintained with transatlantic regulators. </p> <p>He expects to start to feel impact of e-commerce and the internet, with their potential for keeping prices low. \"The internet will increase competition. The upside is large. It increases competition and the richness of information for the customer,\" says Vickers, pointing out that the \"downside\" is the potential for fraud in cyberspace. </p> <p>This is where his language belies his economist background, as he emphasises that it is a \"long-term trend\" and talks about the \"longer run\". He is still very much the academic, a career from which he has only been parted for two years and where he became associated with detailed economic analysis of competition policy and regulatory reform. </p> <p>He was chosen by New Labour to help devise recent competition policy but despite this link to the government, his CV lacks any mention of political activity. He says his interest in regulation and competition began during the privatisation of the utilities by the Thatcher government when he was researching business and public policy. </p> <p>He is the first of acknowledge that the work of the OFT can be very theoretical and dry but insists it should be as \"down to earth\" as possible. \"I say this because I really do think the benefits of competition are practical,\" he says. </p> <p>To turn theory into populist measures, Vickers will have to get used to the public eye and to becoming more widely recognised. Just so long as it does not stop him paddling anonymously with his three young children in the pool near his Cotswold home.</p>",
  "<p>\"Another outspoken Yorkshireman.\" That was the response from many after the recent well-publicised comments from Brian Close about the lack of top-class players at county level because of the ECB central contracts. For some they struck a chord.</p> <p>However, surely the public image of cricket is paramount. Cricket should not be played for the sake of it. It should be entertainment. As Test cricket is by far the most popular form of the game, international players and their fitness should be preserved - as Somerset, losing both Andy Caddick and Marcus Trescothick, and Yorkshire, who missed Darren Gough, Craig White and Michael Vaughan, found to their cost.</p> <p>But the national team's fitness has improved - when all the seamers were firing, England destroyed their opponents, as Zimbabwe, West Indies, and three scores of less than 100 last season will testify.</p> <p>If the county scene is at risk of being sidelined, then this is in part due to the unenterprising nature of captaincy. This isn't helped by a points system in which, for instance, a draw with full bonus points can be almost as profitable as victory.</p> <p>The problem pinpointed by Close could in fact be seen as an opportunity for younger players around the counties to be developed earlier. And if talent was at risk of being compromised, how about a return to the two overseas players of the not-so-distant past?</p> <p>For a more radical solution, how about a reduction to one match against each county in the division, and then having games between the top non-contracted players of, say, six regional groups. This would increase the quality of the younger players. A further benefit would be that, without county money and league tables to play for, a positive result - and thus more entertaining cricket - would be the outcome. Floodlit four- or even five-day cricket could be tried out. Attendances would increase and, again, five-day matches would provide a grounding for young cricketers.</p> <p>These matches could be televised between Tests and would provide revenue for budding international grounds such as Chester-le-Street or Sophia Gardens. The culmination would be a final - North vs South perhaps?</p> <p>Less cricket would be the played, but the cricket would be of a higher quality and there would be more time for practice. The profile of county cricket would be enhanced, rather than pushed into the background by 'Team England.'</p> <p>Let's not look back at the past system of English (and Welsh) cricket but use this as an opportunity - with some imagination it could be used to our advantage. Let's face it - someone's got to provide some competition to Man Utd.</p> <p><em>Gareth Atkins, 18, is about to start his degree at Durham University and is a part-time cricketer.

  "Denmark's decisive 53% vote against joining the euro is a serious setback both for the concept of monetary union and for Britain's possible membership. It would be idle to pretend otherwise. Ministers must be seriously wondering whether it is worth investing the enormous political capital necessary to have a chance of persuading an increasingly sceptical nation of joining an organisation that Danes rejected. They did so despite an almost unified pro-euro campaign by government, opposition parties and industry. It was much less of a jump for them than us because Denmark's currency has been shadowing the euro and its predecessors for nearly 20 years. It is quite likely that euros will start circulating in Denmark since they will have virtually the same value as the Krone. All the same, it was a sobering reminder to Gordon Brown and Tony Blair that, for all their protestations that joining the euro is a matter of technical economics (meeting Mr Brown's five criteria), it is and will remain a profoundly political decision. Danes voted for all sorts of reasons from cocking a snook at the establishment to genuine scepticism about further integration. But there was also a strong element of nationality as Danes asked themselves a question beginning to be asked elsewhere in Europe: who are we and what control do we want to exercise over our own destinies? <p>This is not to say that economic factors weren't important: if the euro had become the strong currency so many of its advocates predicted, it might have moved the votes of enough floating voters to swing the balance. For this reason, the economic circumstances in which a future Labour government would decide whether to hold a referendum could look more favourable for the euro than they do now. Forecasting foreign currency movements is notoriously difficult but there is nevertheless a strong chance that the circumstances which brought about the 25% collapse of the euro will be thrown dramatically into reverse. In this scenario the unexpectedly robust US economy (driven by the internet and high corporate profitability), which has sucked in huge capital flows from Europe, would slow down. This would bring down the value of the dollar, thereby boosting the lost value of the euro (which even the IMF regards as seriously undervalued). If the pound went down as the euro went up then the chronic loss of competitiveness that industry rightly complains about would be reversed. The worry here is not that the dollar will fall - that is almost bound to happen sooner or later - but that the credit-driven expansion of the US economy might go into free fall, triggering the crash that many pundits have been predicting for years but which has stubbornly refused to happen. So far. </p> <p>In these circumstances, the government would be well advised to carry on as before. To ditch the euro now because of special circumstances in one small European country would hand a gift to the opposition that it would flaunt before ministers for years. Labour's policy of offering the electorate a choice through a referendum is far better than the Conservatives' alternative of ruling it out for another parliament. It won't be easy to persuade a Eurosceptic electorate that nirvana lies with the euro. Nothing so far suggests that Britain would have been better off in than out. The canniness of Gordon Brown's position is that all options remain open. If the euro soars and Europe booms, he can seek to persuade Britain. If not, he can wait until the conditions are right and his tests are met: however long that takes.</p>",
  "Tony Blair's government was bowing to the inevitable last night when ministers from both sides of the euro divide admitted that Denmark's rejection of the single currency left a referendum in Britain years away. <p>Despite public protestations that the Danish vote had no implications for the UK's decision, talk of a referendum within a year of a Labour government being re-elected next May was evaporating fast. </p> <p>Privately, it was admitted that the government would only risk a plebiscite on the single currency when the treasury's five economic tests had been met and powerful political resistance to Britain's entry had been overcome. </p> <p>The government pointed out that there was no commitment to holding a referendum in the next parliament, merely the presumption that one would be held. The cabinet, advised by the treasury, will assess whether the five tests have been met early in the next parliament and only then make a decision. </p> <p>It was acknowledged yesterday that Thursday's vote called for a more hard-headed approach in which arguments about the loss of British influence outside the euro were unlikely to cut much ice with a deeply sceptical public. </p> <p>Preparations for a retreat on the referendum were already evident at Labour's Brighton conference last week. Mr Blair and key allies like Peter Mandelson injected far more emphasis on the need to make the political case - not just Gordon Brown's five economic tests - to wary voters when the time comes. </p> <p>Sources said yesterday that it was clear that the risks of holding a referendum had increased, and there was a reluctance to put the possible fruits of a Labour second term in jeopardy when the odds were so stacked against victory. </p> <p>While Labour was putting a brave face on the Danish vote, William Hague's senior lieutenants were jubilant. They claimed that the \"old one-size-fits-all dogma\" of EU centralisation and harmonisation would be forced to give way to a multi-system EU thanks to the \"courageous\" Danes. </p> <p>\"Labour's arguments about our being 'left out' or 'losing influence' unless we sign up to every integrationist project are bogus,\" said Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary. </p> <p>With Mr Blair resting after his party conference, Robin Cook led the pro-euro camp in insisting publicly that the Danish vote will have no effect on the British debate - and that it was vital to the national interest to keep all options open in contrast to the triumphalist reaction of the Eurosceptics. </p> <p>Mr Brown believes the best way of keeping such options open this side of the election is to kick the single currency into touch. Neither side was openly showing its hand yesterday. </p> <p>But one influential MP, Martin O'Neill, pro-euro Labour chairman of the Commons department of trade and industry select committee was more frank in admitting that more delay is the likely result. Mr O'Neill told Radio 4's World At One programme he had hoped the euro's decline would have been reversed thanks to last week's central bank intervention to put a floor under its fall. </p> <p>\"That has not happened. Until it happens, I think we will find that the Labour government is quite capable of saying we cannot risk a massive devaluation which would be required for us to harmonise with the euro, and that therefore there will be a continuing delay. </p> <p>Mr O'Neill added: \"The value of your currency is not a subjective economic test. It is one that is there for all to see. Unless there is a marked improvement in the value of the euro, I think it would be very difficult for people like myself who want us to join...quickly to advocate an accelerated process because it would mean devaluation and the threat of inflation.\" </p> <p>In Copenhagen, the aftermath of Thursday's referendum saw policymakers desperately trying to defend the krone from speculative attack. The government raised interest rates by half a percentage point to 5.6% and insisted that its commitment to Europe remained strong despite the resounding No to the single currency. </p> <p>\"We'll do all we can to safeguard our fixed currency link to the euro,\" said the prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, who led the Yes campaign in its defeat by 53.1% to 46.9%. </p> <p>Holger Nielsen, of the Socialist People's Party, said: \"The referendum has shown that there is a huge gap between law-makers and voters.\"</p>",
  "<p>William Hague is to be upstaged at next week's Tory conference by the party's \"big beasts\", Michael Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, who are planning to lambast the leadership for extremism over Europe. </p> <p>Infuriated by Mr Hague's hardening euroscepticism, the two former cabinet heavyweights will make provocative interventions in Bournemouth to cause maximum damage to the Tory leadership. </p> <p>Mr Clarke will begin the pro-Europe fightback in a speech on Tuesday lunchtime that will coincide exactly with an appearance by Mr Hague at anti-euro rally. </p> <p>As the Tory leader mounts his \"keep the pound\" lorry outside the main conference centre at 1pm, the former chancellor will stand up at a fringe meeting to accuse Mr Hague of endangering British interests by ruling out membership of the euro for five years. \"Ken will be in punching form,\" one friend said yesterday. </p> <p>In a carefully orchestrated operation by the pro-Europeans, Mr Clarke will be followed a few hours later by Mr Heseltine who will address a dinner hosted by the \"wet\" Tory Reform Group. The dinner has been sponsored by the British Midland chairman, Sir Michael Bishop, a strong supporter of the cross-party Britain in Europe group, which is supported by Mr Heseltine and Tony Blair. </p> <p>The appearances by the Tories' two most senior pro-Europeans will ensure that the following day's headlines are dominated by Tory divisions over Europe. Central office had hoped to send out a message of unity on Tuesday, the second day of the conference, because it has arranged for Mr Hague and Michael Portillo to make appearances. </p> <p>The decision by the pro-Europeans to embarrass Mr Hague in public underlines their growing anger with the leadership's increasing Euroscepticism. \"It is going to be really poisonous,\" one Tory pro-European said yesterday. \"Just look at the leadership's lunatic exploitation of the Danish referendum result. It's going to be great fun for the press.\" </p> <p>Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine, who spoke out last year after the leadership said it wanted to renegotiate British membership of the EU, had planned to keep their powder dry at this year's conference because of the impending general election. However, they abandoned their plans to bury the hatchet earlier this month when Mr Hague adopted a strongly anti-European tone in his mini-manifesto, Believing in Britain. </p> <p>The manifesto underlined the leadership's Euroscepticism by claiming that Britain \"may be drifting to its own destruction\" thanks to the European Union. The Tories pledged to introduce special legislation at Westminster to prevent more powers passing to Brussels. </p> <p>\"That was the final straw. We decided we could not remain silent in the light of such hysterical nonsense,\" the pro-Europe source said.</p>",
  "Pro-euro politicians and business leaders were putting a brave face on the Danish electorate's Nej yesterday, insisting that it will have only short-term and marginal impact on the long-stalled British debate on joining the euro. <p>Denmark's foreign minister, Neils Helveg Petersen, gallantly took the same view. \"I don't have a message for the British people,\" the leading member of the defeated Ja campaign said as the prospects of a UK referendum receded from late 2001 or 2002 to 2003 or beyond. </p> <p>\"They read newspapers and I am sure they will know what conclusions to draw. I don't think I should give advice. I have just lost a referendum,\" said Mr Petersen in Copenhagen. </p> <p>But the predictable howls of glee which rose from the Euro-sceptics and their Fleet Street allies brushed aside such caution. </p> <p>As John Major found to his cost, the last time the Danes rejected an integrationist move in Europe - the first referendum on the Maastricht treaty in 1992 - its impact on domestic British politics were as destructive as anything they have done since their longships stopped pillaging and looting in the 9th century. </p> <p>In 1992 the legislation implementing ratification of Maastricht was shelved at Westminster and Mr Major's Eurosceptic tendency ran amok. Within months sterling fell out of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), precursor to the single currency. </p> <p>The economy recovered, but the Major government was fatally wounded. Despite all yesterday's protestations that Denmark's rejection of the euro will make no difference to the British decision - and Nissan's renewed warning about investment decisions - business is already starting to plan on the basis that UK entry is a long way off. </p> <p>The director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Digby Jones, decided months ago that his organisation would not be split by internal rows over the euro at a time when the government was refusing to take a lead itself in the debate. </p> <p>Both the Treasury and the Bank of England were already decidedly lukewarm about early British entry, with the bank's governor, Sir Eddie George, saying this month that Britain would have suffered an inflationary boom had it joined the euro from the outset. </p> <p>Such caution will be strengthened by Thursday's vote, particularly since the performance of the UK economy since the 1992 crisis has been exceptionally good. Ministers are not insensitive to the point - and William Hague will claim vindication. </p> <p>Yet the impact of this week's vote will not last for ever and even the cabinet's most ardent pro-Europeans were yesterday free to say that the government must now play a long-term game. </p> <p>\"We have to address the long-term political dimension because it's a big thing in many people's minds - even though ultimately it will be economics which clinch it,\" one senior minister said last night. \"If we can persuade people on the political and constitutional side it will help them overcome these concerns.\" </p> <p>Hans Jorgen Neilsen, a Danish pollster, agreed that economics are not enough. \"Blair should start to try to convince the British people that the euro is necessary not just for the government and for business but for the whole country, and that being in Europe is about being part of a community,\" he said. </p> <p>\"That was what was wrong with the yes campaign here.\" </p> <p>MPs on both sides know that unlike in Denmark the British media is deeply divided and even more influential. As one City economist, David Brown of Bear Stearns, put it: \"Euro-antipathy is so strong that the chances of getting the UK into the EMU in the next decade would be a miracle on a par with the raising of Lazarus from the dead.\" </p> <p>Tony Blair is privately committed to the euro, as a political as well as an economic goal, but, uncharacteristically, he is a fence-sitter on tactics. On one side he has Peter Mandelson who believes that ministers should bide their time but make occasional pro-euro speeches; on the other is Gordon Brown who will see the Danish vote as an endorsement of his cautious wait and see policy. </p> <p>The chancellor believes that attempts to massage sterling down to a lower level would risk the return of the boom-bust conditions that bedevilled the economy in the 70s and 80s; either that or he would have to deflate the economy through higher taxes. The Brown view is that the government's best chance of persuading a sceptical public to accept the euro will be if the economy is in good health and the five tests he set for entry in October 1997 have been met. </p> <p>Neither Kenneth Clarke nor Charles Kennedy will be pleased, but even Mr Mandelson, Stephen Byers and Robin Cook, equally pro-euro, do not believe in wasting political capital before the time is ripe. </p> <p>Exporters to Europe will be less pleased by the Danish decision, since they were hoping that early euro-entry would lead to a weaker pound and make selling into Britain's main market more profitable. Rumblings from Nissan have suggested that it may not build the new Micra in Britain because of the strength of sterling. </p> <p>So far, however, disinvestment has not happened. Inward investment is running at record levels, and is particularly strong from the US, where investors barely mention Britain's participation in monetary union as a factor in their decisions.</p>",
  "Britain's Europhiles could be forgiven for crying into their Carlsberg after the Danish referendum. Overnight, the Eurosceptics have transformed this small corner of Scandinavia into a matchbox version of Blighty and presented their campaign as a dry-run of our referendum. The Danish \"Nej\" is meant to be the end of our debate. But history may see it as the moment when the pro-Europeans finally came out fighting. <p>The reflex action of the yes camp has been to stress the differences between Britain and Denmark. The pint-size krone is indeed a less attractive target for speculators than an international currency like the pound. And as the krone was already pegged to the euro, it was difficult to persuade voters that the euro would bring any new economic benefits. </p> <p>Denmark also has fewer floating voters. Public opinion has been hardened by six referendums on European questions in the past 20 years. This wearying succession of public debates has left few undecided. In Britain, there is still everything to fight for. Opinion polls show that almost half the country say they are \"open to persuasion\" on the euro. </p> <p>The issues in Copenhagen were completely different. Many older voters feared that Denmark's generous welfare state would be jeopardised by hard-nosed monetarists in the European Central Bank - not a common complaint here. And fears over Denmark's power within the EU are similarly alien. The imposition of EU sanctions on Austria led to real public concern that small countries would be left powerless. Defeat in Denmark can teach pro-Europeans three important lessons. </p> <p>First it shows that Blair must win the political - as well as the economic - argument on the euro. The Danish yes campaign showed beyond doubt that even the people convinced of the benefits for jobs and mortgages will still vote no if we lose the argument on sovereignty. The yes campaign should therefore argue that pooling sovereignty in the EU is the best way to maintain our influence over our everyday lives on economics, the environment and security. And outside the euro we will never punch our weight. This argument is already partly won. A majority of British public opinion is in favour of European action in the areas where they think it makes sense - on pollution and defence. </p> <p>Making the political case for the euro will depend on getting the big picture right. The Danish yes campaign was defeated on the details. It often ended up on a defensive footing - frantically rebutting scare stories about pensions and tax harmonisation, because it failed to set out a practical, attractive vision of the EU. The prime minister needs to set out an EU blueprint to rival the federal super-state of popular imagination. </p> <p>Timing is half the battle. The Danish campaign coincided with all-time lows in the value of the euro against the dollar and was called during a severe bout of mid-term blues. Tony Blair would be wise to keep his flexible formula on the timing of the referendum (\"early in the next parliament\") if he is to avoid temporary storms blowing him off course. </p> <p>There is often a temptation to preach to the converted. Of course it's true that the public will listen to expert voices on economics and that views will filter down from the boardroom. But the yes campaign in Denmark spent a disproportionate amount of time and resources wooing the sharp suits that were already onboard. The next phase of the euro campaign in Britain has to take the battle from the business pages and CBI receptions to glossy magazines and kitchen tables. </p> <p>The testosterone-fuelled political classes should not lose sight of the fact that the euro campaign will have to be targeted at women. A gaping gender gap proved fatal to the yes camp in Denmark, who couldn't find a language and style to appeal to women voters. In Britain, according to a recent Mori poll, only 27% of women would vote in favour of a single currency compared to 35% of men. </p> <p>The final lesson is the most important. Whatever the political strategy, Denmark has shown how the referendum will be won or lost by that most elusive of political commodities: public trust. This will be more important than the detail of economic argument and will have to come from politicians, not business leaders. </p> <p> Though Danish business opinion was overwhelmingly in favour, the scepticism of a handful of high-profile bankers gave the impression that opinion was divided. As Bob Worcester convincingly argues in the Foreign Policy Centre pamphlet, How To Win The Euro Referendum, when expert opinion is split on complex issues, the electorate will respond to politicians they trust. </p> <p>According to this law, Danish prime minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was doomed from the start. Ever since he failed to implement the \"efterlon\", a manifesto pledge to lower the age of retirement, he lost public confidence. Only 8% of the electorate express \"a lot of trust\" in him. Even in the middle of the fuel crisis, Tony Blair scored much higher. </p> <p>Preserving this trust means being obsessive about the credibility of your arguments. Don't make claims for Europe that don't stack up. Under the Tories, it was true that the EU offered people social protection that the government denied them. But everyone knows that they can get social benefits from a Labour government with or without EU support. This means focusing only on areas where Europe can add value: the single market, cheaper prices, environmental action, defence and the battle against organised crime. And it means being honest about the facts. The Danish yes camp was not believed when it made dark predictions of economic doom. British pro-Europeans should not flinch from pointing out the dangers of staying out of the euro zone, but they should steer clear of apocalyptic rhetoric. </p> <p>Pulling off the greatest turnaround in public opinion since the war will be no easy task. The leader of the yes campaign in Britain will need to find a new political vocabulary, capable of reaching the parts that other politicians can't. And they'll need to do it at a time when faith in the political system has never been lower. But pro-Europeans should relish the challenge. We have all the arguments on our side. All we need to do is find effective proselytisers for our cause. To vulgarise a phrase from that fabled communicator in the Whitehouse: \"It's the politics, stupid.\" </p> <p> Mark Leonard is director of the Foreign Policy Centre.

  "Before Brynle Williams and the other blockaders hit the barricades outside those oil terminals again, you might want to give some thought to alternative fuel cars. <p>Once the province of woolly socked environmentalists, gas-powered cars have suddenly taken off in a big way. Major manufacturers are launching ranges of their models which can run on liquid propane gas (LPG) or compressed natural gas (CNG) and hybrid cars that are a combination of electricity and petrol driven engines. </p> <p>And if you have a car that is less than 12 months old, the government may even give you some financial help towards the cost of converting it from a simple petrol engine to a dual fuel machine. The reason? Gas-powered cars are far cheaper to run and they are streets ahead of petrol in the clean burn, low emissions stakes. People in the know say they will be the cars of the future. </p> <p>Dual fuel cars have two tanks, one containing petrol and one containing either CNG or LPG. In theory, a car can run on gas alone and cars of the future probably will but, in the meantime, because there are not a large number of places where you can refuel on gas, you need a petrol tank in case you run out. That is all set to change, but more of that later. </p> <p>So, CNG - what's that? Compressed natural gas is the stuff you have piped into your home for cooking and central heating. Swedish manufacturer Volvo, which is big in the dual fuel car market, introduced the first CNG/petrol driven car to the UK in 1996. But CNG is proving less practical and less popular as an alternative fuel for the private motorist than LPG. </p> <p>Although CNG is cleaner in terms of emissions, it needs a much bigger tank which makes it less suitable for the small private car. At the moment there are only 13 CNG compressors in the UK, so there are very few places where you can refuel. Some councils and bus companies are using CNG vehicles and have their own high compression units installed which can fill up in three minutes. </p> <p>It is possible to have a compression unit in your own home, but because of mains pressure to private properties you need to fuel up your car overnight, which takes about seven hours. And the cost of a compressor at \u00a31,500 to \u00a32,000 is another turn-off. </p> <p>\"At the moment CNG is a niche player in the market,\" says Volvo's environmental manager John Pitts, \"but if the price of a home compressor came down then natural gas would become a big player.\" </p> <p>LPG is a different matter. Manufacturers are rolling out more and more LPG cars and in response fuel suppliers are bringing more and more fuel stations where you can buy it, on line. It is estimated that five new outlets open each week and there are now 500 in Britain with a target of 1,000 by the end of 2001. LPG works out at 39.9p a litre, as opposed to the average 84p a litre for petrol. The government takes a much lower rate of duty from LPG - 13.4p a litre, about 33% of the total price, and 61p a litre from petrol, about 76% of the price. </p> <p>BP Oil UK is building a network of LPG stations called BP Autogas - its Plymouth site was the UK's 500th, and opened a fortnight ago. </p> <p>\"We have 72 sites up and running and a further 12 in build at the moment with a target of 300 by the end of 2003,\" says spokesman Clive Kirkham. \"LPG makes sense because of the substantial financial savings and environmental benefits. The majority of car manufacturers are looking in this direction.\" </p> <p>British Gas, which supplies CNG and LPG, is working with Elf and Sainsbury's to supply to the private motorist. </p> <p>There are other advantages to running an LPG-fuelled car. Richard Wilson, head of direct services for Sevenoaks District Council in Kent, explains: \"Because LPG is a much cleaner fuel oil changes are every 15,000 miles, compared to 6,000 miles for a petrol engine, and engine tuning is every 40,000 miles instead of every 10,000 miles for a petrol engine.\" </p> <p>The council's fleet of seven LPG vans is used by pest control officers, the dog warden and parking attendants. \"We had no problems during the petrol crisis,\" says Wilson. </p> <p>Government backing for alternative fuel cars is another reason for the sudden upsurge in interest. Not only can you buy an LPG-fuelled car, but also it is possible to convert your vehicle if it is less than 12 months old and get a grant to do it. </p> <p>Powershift, which is funded by the Energy Savings Trust, aims to promote cleaner cars. With \u00a310m funding, Powershift will subsidise your conversion costs on a scale from 25% to 75% depending on the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. Powershift will also help fund the extra cost of buying a dual fuel car using the same criteria. </p> <p>Volvo is confident that its V40 range, due for launch at Christmas, will qualify for a 75% rebate on the \u00a31,800 estimated extra cost of the vehicle. The company is also producing gas fuelled S80s which will be available in CNG and LPG and a V70 estate in both gas choices. </p> <p>Vauxhall has introduced dual fuel versions of the Astra in hatchback, saloon and estate versions. And Honda has brought out the first commercially available petrol electric hybrid car in Europe. The Insight does not need an external electric supply and is very fuel efficient. It costs \u00a317,000. Other makers who have dual fuel ranges are Ford, Volkswagen, Skoda, Daewoo, Nissan, Citroen, Proton and Renault. </p> <p>Insurance should not cost you any more but at the moment companies have not computerised the vehicles so you will probably need a broker to get you cover. </p> <p>And finally: are dual fuel cars safe? Jonathan Murray, head of transport projects at Powershift, says there are safety devices to cut the valves on the fuel lines and safe pressure release to avoid the danger of fire in an accident.</p>",
  "Police will not be used to break future fuel blockades in the way they were used to smash the miners' strike in the 1980s, under an agreement signed yesterday aimed at preventing a repeat of fuel shortages. <p>The fuel supply taskforce yesterday released a memorandum of understanding aimed at preventing a repeat of last month's disruption to fuel supplies. </p> <p>Police had to rely on existing public order legislation during the demonstrations as they were not trade disputes and anti-picketing legislation did not apply. With lorry drivers and oil companies apparently reluctant to keep supplies moving in the face of opposition, few attempts were made to breach the blockades and the police were, in effect, powerless to intervene. </p> <p>Police were unable to effectively prevent go-slow protests on major routes as driving slowly is not illegal unless it is persistent. Video evidence or other proof is required before arrests can be made. The removal of hauliers' licences is also complex and could not be enforced overnight. </p> <p>The memorandum commits all parties to work together to ensure that fuel always reaches essential services, but contains no detail on how the police, criticised for a lack of action earlier this month, will change their approach to deal with future protests. </p> <p>With ministers considering extending civil duties legislation to oil companies, requiring them to ensure supply to users in the same way as the major utilities, the oil companies agreed to try to ensure their lorries got through future blockades. The home secretary, Jack Straw, conceded that the plan drawn up by the taskforce would not guarantee disruption-free supply of fuel. </p> <p>\"The idea of the memorandum is to ensure that every signatory - the oil companies, central government, the devolved administrations, the police, the trade unions - is involved in taking the necessary contingency action against possible future disruption,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Straw described the memorandum as a \"medium-term programme of work\" and said legal changes were being considered, to impose a civil duty on oil companies to keep supplies flowing, or to alter criminal laws on blockades. \"Changes in the law could not be introduced until the end of this year at the earliest,\" he said. </p> <p>He added: \"One difference we anticipate is that the speed and the scale of the response will be different.\" </p> <p>Under the taskforce plan, early warning systems would be put in place to alert authorities to the threat of protest; joint crisis management systems would be put in place and action would be taken to prevent intimidation of tanker drivers. </p> <p>Welcoming the move, Malcolm Brinded, chairman of Shell UK said: \"We are happy to commit to this memorandum. We have a great interest in maintaining continuity of oil supplies to all our customers and, like other signatories, will do all we can to minimise future disruption.\"</p>",
  "<p>Dangerous Curves, Casual Sex and She's Having a Baby were three of the handful of movies Valerie Breiman acted in. Bikini Squad and Babes Ahoy were the two exploitation movies she directed for hire. Now Breiman has made her writing-directing debut with a little number called Love &amp; Sex. Starting to see a pattern here? OK, so the joke-cracking San Franciscan has a certain thematic obsession. But that's where the similarities between her earlier work and Love &amp; Sex end. L&amp;S charts the pitfall-strewn path of a romance not unlike one the film-maker stumbled through herself. Strong on observation, it's an honest comedy by a smart chick you want to get to know. </p> <p><strong>Love &amp; Sex is loosely based on your relationship with the film-maker Adam Rifkin. Why put so much embarrassing personal detail out there for all to see?</strong></p> <p>This relationship was so ridiculous, in a lot of ways, that both of us wrote scripts about it. If you've seen the film, during the period of time when she was with the Italian and Adam flipped out and wanted her back, that really happened and that was about the time that he wrote his script. Then he sent it to my house so that the Italian would read it. After I finished up with the Italian - that was only a few months long - Adam and I started becoming real friends. About three years after that, when we had gotten to an almost normal state of friendship, that's when I wrote my script.</p> <p><strong>So we should believe that everything in the film happened to you?</strong></p> <p>Almost everything they do and say in the film is taken from our relationship. Some things almost verbatim, which is really spooky when we watch it. Of course, a lot of craft had to go into making him more likeable for audiences.</p> <p><strong>Was it weird for the actors, knowing that they were playing Adam and yourself?</strong> </p> <p>Once I got Jon [Favreau] and Famke [Janssen] to play us, it really became less personal. There would be moments, because Jon was uncannily like Adam and he hung out and studied Adam a little bit, but just subtle things. But it became less and less like my life as it took on a life of its own. And it was OK for them, we joked about it. I told the actors right from the start, \"Yes, it's based on me, but it's not like I'm trying in any way to make you us.\" I mean, she and I could not be any more different. She's a tall, brunette supermodel, and I'm not. Well, maybe inside I am.</p> <p><strong>You struggled for more than six years to get the financing in place for Love &amp; Sex. After all that, was directing your first personal film worth all the effort?</strong></p> <p>It was phenomenal. My dream come true. And the actual shooting of it was great, because we had five days to rehearse and get the actors to really develop their chemistry, which they did very well. It was a wonderful experience and really fun.</p> <p><strong>Any feelings about getting back into the studio system, either as an actor, writer or director?</strong></p> <p>I'm keeping it open. And because Love &amp; Sex is sort of a commercial movie, I've had a lot of offers from studios to do big comedies that other people have written. But I haven't chosen one because I haven't really loved any of them yet. I like the writing and directing because, to me, that's the full telling of the story. As for acting, I'm not pursuing that at all. I think of putting myself in tiny roles in the films I make, but the one I was going to do in Love &amp; Sex I gave to a friend. So now Adam is in charge of putting me in all of his films. I gave him a dog-walking cameo in this one, and I expect thoroughly for him to reciprocate. </p>",
  "<p>Brian Keenan recalls every moment of his release from captivity in Beirut. How, after four and a half years chained to a wall in cells never more than six foot by four, they came to him, out of the blue - \"You go home Braham.\" They had always confused his name, calling him a mixture of Abraham and Brian. How they tricked him out of saying goodbye to his friend, fellow hostage John McCarthy - \"Later, later you see him\" - then bundled him into a car and took him blindfolded, his head on one guard's lap. \"And him stroking my face.\" First to one room, where he tried to leave a message in a book, writing with a burnt-out match. Then, in another car, to the hills above the city, where Keenan was passed over to the Syrians. As they walked towards the Syrians, the young guard held his hand - not roughly, but like they were mates. Two people who would not meet again. \"I guess they are all dead now. I don't say that with relish. And I don't know it for sure. But it's what I imagine.\" </p> <p>At the Dutch Embassy in Damascus, after a two-day debriefing by the Syrians, they treated him lavishly, like a returning hero. He was offered anything he wanted. What he wanted, he said, was first an Irish coffee and then some chocolate and an ice cream. \"Which is odd, because I don't even like chocolate.\" Kids' comfort food. But they brought him a full-blown meal, anyway. \"Insisted on it\" - knowing, or thinking they knew, better than he what a man who had endured so much deprivation must desire. \"I couldn't eat a thing.\" </p> <p>And so it began. His re-emergence into a world he thought he knew, the world he had left behind, but different now. Not so much because the world had changed, or even because he himself had changed. But because his place in the world had changed. He went into the cell Brian Keenan, an unknown university teacher from Belfast. He then became Brian Keenan, the disappeared. </p> <p>\"Not to myself. To myself I never disappeared, I knew exactly where I was.\" Crucial, this. All the time that the world knew nothing of his existence, he hadn't ceased to exist, though he had transposed worlds. His reality, confined though it was, was his own. He didn't look outside. \"My recollection is that if you focus on the real world, which isn't your real world, because your world is here in your head, then you are going to make life very difficult.\" </p> <p>In his account of this time, An Evil Cradling, he describes \"a world in which nothing happens, and yet everything happens\", and his struggle to retain control over this world. Now, he says, \"In these conditions the mind opens up.\" As if the external constraints somehow operate to remove inner constraints. \"You are in the dark, there are no windows, you can't see. But, tiny and oppressive as it is, you find in your mind ways to push the walls back.\" What he's describing is kind of liberation. It's a paradox he is well aware of - that in captivity he was somehow free. And yes, he says, there have been times when he has wanted to go back there. \"Because the mind was so lucid and so fascinating. But, of course, I am not going back.\" </p> <p>He came out and the world embraced him and he became Brian Keenan the man from Beirut. Not his choice. He describes his arrival back in Dublin, on a private government jet, as a series of baffled sensations. The noise. \"People in the viewing gallery cheering.\" The sudden lights. \"Flashing cameras. I was blinded.\" The red carpet under his feet. \"I instinctively stepped off it. I hadn't walked on a carpet in over four years. Charles Haughey, the Irish prime minister of the day, pulled me back on.\" </p> <p>Later, in the hospital where he was sent for routine tests, he suddenly noticed that the walls were the same colour as the last place he had been held. He asked a friend to get him out. The world's press was waiting for him at the hospital doors. \"So Frank suggested taking me out in the boot of his car. And that's how we did it.\" He laughs because of the obvious irony - as though he'd been hijacked again. Which, in a way, he had. Caught in the captive glare of fame. </p> <p>He hates it, and he hasn't got used to it. \"It embarrasses me.\" A shy, modest man, he accepts it when people come up to him in the pub, offering him drinks, asking to shake his hand. He is polite and politely unimpressed. He doesn't want this fame. \"I don't really understand it. What have I done? I didn't ask to be kidnapped.\" </p> <p>He talks about a letter he received recently from a woman whose daughter is dying of leukaemia. \"There's far more heroism in that woman than there will ever be in me.\" Now, he says, he turns down offers to speak about his experience. \"It's the past. Why would I want to do that?\" He has always refused to go to America to lecture. \"I am asked and I say, 'No.'\" Money couldn't tempt him. \"Money has always been the last thing on my mind. Though I don't have a lot of it. I have to work, my wife has to work.\" </p> <p>Stubbornly - it is stubbornness that he considers his principal trait - he has resisted having an identity foisted on him. And this has served him well. But intransigence, as he points out, can carry its own terrible consequences. \"If I believe something, I believe it passionately and no one will change it. It's awful. I am old enough to know better, old enough to rationalise things. But, with me, belief has to be a hundred per cent.\" So he can understand, he says, what happened in Beirut. \"The ramifications of that sort of belief. Why they took hostages. How they came to murder six people. I don't approve. But I can understand it.\" </p> <p>John McCarthy once explained to me how between them they developed a way of dealing with the guards. \"Brian would confront them, refuse to give in to their ludicrous little demands. Make a stand. Then I would negotiate away from this ...\" And, as with the guards, Keenan is not renowned for his easy co-operation. No one could persuade him, after he came out, to write his memoirs before he was ready. \"I had decided I would not write a book until everyone was out. They would all have their own stories, no way would I pre-empt anyone by getting in first.\" And if some of them hadn't come home? \"Maybe I would still have written it, but I would have asked the families first. I would have had to. I couldn't have lived with myself if I had caused any hurt, because then I would have become my own little terrorist.\" </p> <p>He had to wait a year before McCarthy was released in August 1991. And almost six months more before first Terry Waite, in November 1991, and then Terry Anderson, a month later, were released. These must have been terrible times for him. \"No,\" he says, \"not really. I worried at first, but I was always confident they would come home.\" Even after he knew about the deaths of the Americans? \"I can't remember,\" he says, \"when I found out that the Americans had been killed.\" He wrote in An Evil Cradling, and he reiterates now, that he felt bad about leaving McCarthy alone. He still thinks about it, and is not clear in his mind if he did the wrong thing. Though he had no choice, there was a mutual debt between them. That's what he learned in captivity, he says. </p> <p>\"That survival is mutual. Everyone there had to put a part of themselves on the table for everyone else to take what they needed.\" So, until the debt was clear, he would not be free to act. He is a very unusual man, in many ways no doubt. But in one way in particular. He is not prepared to be cynical. Unmodern, you could say, in that way. </p> <p> There is some irony but no coincidence that Keenan was born in Belfast - \"the most political city I have ever been in\". His personality was formed in that divide - the weight of one group oppressively bearing down on another. He was brought up a Protestant. \"For what that's worth.\" And he was 18 when the Troubles started in 1968. \"I suppose I could have got caught up in it. If I'd been a bit younger, had less of a head on my shoulders, I could have been locked up in a prison in Belfast rather than in Beirut.\" </p> <p>His mother, a housewife, used to say to him: \"Politics stops at your doorstep.\" \"But I never knew if she meant coming in or going out.\" His father was a telephone engineer and before that he worked on the buses. A sweet man. \"I remember him bringing home all these injured animals he'd find on the road and mum telling him to get them out.\" </p> <p>Keenan took his destiny in his hands, dropping out of the plumber's apprenticeship he started, getting himself to university to read English literature, and then becoming a teacher: the only kid in his street, as he has often said - and not in a self- congratulatory manner - to do so. </p> <p>Though he loves Belfast, he kept trying to get out. He lived in Spain, in Brussels, did a community care course in Aberdeen. But he kept going back. \"It's my city, my home and things were happening.\" But by the mid-80s, he'd had enough. \"Belfast was falling apart.\" He had given up teaching, \"because what the kids needed to learn they were learning on the streets and not in my classroom. And maybe they were right about that. WB Yeats wasn't going to get them through it.\" </p> <p>Community work was more frustrating. \"Because, whatever you tried to do, it just came back to politicians fighting and bitching.\" He was 34, \"very discontent\", so he made a plan to go to Australia via Beirut, where he had a contract in the American University to work for one year. He knew Beirut was a dangerous place. But then, from anyone's perspective, so was Belfast. He almost changed his mind. \"I suddenly felt very apprehensive.\" Then the stubbornness kicked in. \"And I am afraid of being afraid.\" So he made himself go. </p> <p>Keenan is an odd mixture of the literal and the intensely poetic - both these helped to preserve him in prison. He used his willpower and his practical intelligence to make what sense he could of what was happening to him - he could kid himself for only a few days that they'd let him out as soon as they found he was an Irishman. And, as he has said, he used his imagination to escape into himself. Alone, for five months, he invented or rather elaborated a character, Turlough O'Carolan, Ireland's national musician, a 17th-century itinerant blind harpist, who became his companion. A strange choice, you might think, when he could have imagined some sexy seductress. But, as he knew, or was beginning to know, survival depended somehow on suspending desire, not promoting it. Men in prison, he says, think of sex far less than you'd believe. \"That's an invention from movies. The men I knew in captivity didn't talk about sex much at all.\" They couldn't bear to. </p> <p>O'Carolan became his companion. A way of distancing himself from what was happening to him. He helped to keep him sane. Psychiatrists, Keenan says, would probably have declared him clinically insane for much of this time. \"And they may be right. But they may also be wrong.\" For Keenan, Turlough was a lifeline and he made a deal with himself. When he came out, if he came out, he would commit himself to two tasks. He would build a house on the west coast of Ireland, which he has done: a traditional cottage with the view out of one window of Clare Island and out of the other a view of Croagh Patrick, the holiest mountain in Ireland. And he would write a book, a novel, about this man who came to him in his cell and would comfort him. </p> <p>Someone, trying to be clever, once said that the Irish are sentimental about causes but never about people. Keenan is a living rebuke to this. The only debts he wants to repay are to people - those who have helped him. In spite of his temper, which he says is terrific, his passion and his conviction, he seems utterly without vengeance. Anyway, he kept to his deal - built first the cottage and then set about writing the book. \"It was a debt of honour,\" he says. \"I was doing it for him and for me. To get the monkey off my back.\" </p> <p>It was almost impossible, he says. He couldn't find a way of inhabiting Turlough's head. \"I am no historian, I am musically illiterate, I can't play the harp. I am not blind.\" And apart from this he had never written a work of fiction. Quite simply, he didn't know how to do it. He'd start, chuck it in. Start again. He couldn't get rid of it. He was invited to give a lecture in Alaska on writing. It seemed a good place to go to get away, but even here he found himself talking about Turlough. </p> <p> Some time after he got home to Ireland, he received a letter from an Inuit woman who had heard him speak. He could hardly make out her name and she didn't give an address. \"I always reply to people who write to me however mad they may seem.\" She told him that Turlough is what is known in native American mythology as a dreamwalker. \"Someone who inhabits dreams, who sees in his dreams. Who has, what this woman called, blindsightedness.\" Keenan thought she was nuts. But then she wrote again, and again no address. And as she explained more about dreamwalkers in her letter, he began to see a way through to the man. </p> <p>What was known about Turlough was his music, his art. He is honoured and revered by many musicians through the centuries, in contemporary times particularly by the Chieftains, who have been playing Turlough's music for 30 years. Yet nothing was known \"of Turlough's head and his heart\". </p> <p>This is the book Keenan has written. An imaginative exploration of the man. Another kind of cradling, you could say, though this time benevolent. Keenan visits Turlough on his deathbed, comes into the room where he is dying, much as Turlough came to him in his room when he was in despair. And through Keenan's book Turlough is reborn not as a musician, not as a historical character, but as a man. \"Fleshy, honest, frail, complex.\" And if this sounds like a self-portrait, it may be that, too. There are echoes here, too, of Eliot's lines in his great poem Journey Of The Magi: \"I had seen birth and death/ But had thought they were different; this birth was/ Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.\" And ... \"I should be glad of another death.\" </p> <p>In allowing himself this other death, Keenan himself is reborn. He doesn't see it this way, couldn't be expected to - rejecting as he always has the identity of the man from Beirut. But it is there in the parallels between the two men: the sensory deprivation; the interior journey; Turlough's estrangement from his own background - he comes out of the peasant community and is taken up by the Irish ruling class as their itinerant minstrel - much as the west would have had Keenan play its tune. And all this, as Keenan says, at one of the most brutal times in Irish history, the late 17th century, when the Protestant ascendancy finally crushed the Catholic opposition. </p> <p>\"It marked the end of old Ireland, the end of the Gaelic order, when everything was taken from us, even our language was taken from us. If the term ethnic cleansing has any meaning, it was there in Ireland three centuries before it was manifest in eastern Europe.\" </p> <p>Much as Turlough was able to reconcile his two worlds - Ireland the physical place with all its history, \"which, though he couldn't see what was going on around him, he could sense\", and his own inner life, through music - this book becomes Keenan's reconciliation, the means finally by which he can take control again of his own destiny. You could also say that it signals Ireland's destiny - which is not English control. \"I do believe that this island should be one land.\" All of which makes it a bold book. Keenan is nervous, he says. \"It hasn't gone out to the public yet. I think that maybe the people who have read my books before will find this a strange departure.\" But then this is, of course, its point. </p> <p>When he was in the cell, he tried not not to think about love, and when he came out he wasn't ready to. \"Coming out of that place, where there was so little in the way of affection, I was very aware that I could just fall into something.\" So he took his time, went off to live in a house in County Mayo lent to him by a priest. \"I'd never met him, but he wrote to me offering the house.\" It was away from the media, there was no phone, no television. \"No one could find me there.\" And he started to think and eventually to put on to tape his experience of those four years. One day, he was playing it back to himself, \"and I realised I was just weeping, it all came flooding out, like Vesuvius. There I was listening to this man, who was me, talking out that cell, the tears streaming down my face.\" He remembers the day. It was, he says, exactly nine months after he came out. That's how long it took to give birth to the human being again. </p> <p>It was soon after this that he rang Audrey, a physiotherapist he had met while he was in hospital. \"I had rather cheekily taken her number from one of the duty rosters.\" Five years ago, they married and they now have two sons, Jack, three and Colum, 10 months. \"People say Colum is a Scots name. But it's not. It's an old Irish name that was stolen by the Scots.\" </p> <p>He wasn't sure about fatherhood. \"I was anxious, still am. I thought, at 45, I was too old. But they are nice kids, lovely people.\" And tall, both of them are going to be over six foot. \"As a small person I always wanted to be tall.\" When he was, his mum used to say to him, \"'Be careful with what you want, you may get it.' So, she was right. I did get it.\" </p> <p>In his book he writes. \"It is memory that ages us not time.\" The mind forgets nothing, he says. \"I may forget things, but the mind doesn't.\" In captivity he found himself remembering details from his childhood, things that he didn't even know he knew. \"I could smell the linoleum in the house I grew up in. I could feel, twirl in my hand, the earrings that my mother wore when I was a child and she'd carry me in her arms.\" So he knows, however much he says, what happened in Beirut is the past. \"It's like a book I can take down from a shelf and read it and replace.\" </p> <p>Beirut is part of him. Next week he is coming to London to see Terry Anderson, who is over from the States. Soon after, John McCarthy is going to Dublin to celebrate Keenan's 50th birthday. \"Audrey said we have to do something, so that's what we're doing.\" So he says he is not the anti-social melancholic he has sometimes been cast as. \"I have a lot of friends. And I made sure of holding on to all the friendships I had in Belfast before I became famous.\" What he is saying here and in his book is that there is not one past, but many different pasts. Pasts before Beirut to which he also owes a debt </p> <p> \u0095 Turlough, by Brian Keenan, will be published by Jonathan Cape on October 5, priced \u00a316.99.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Mo Mowlam: The Biography</strong> <br> Julia Langdon<br> 299pp, Little, Brown<br> \u00a316.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502379837,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> <br></p> <p> She is brave, ebullient, effective and immensely popular. A year after the general election of May 1997 that brought Tony Blair's New Labour government to power, her rating among the public stood at 86 per cent, exceeding that of any of her colleagues, the Prime Minister included. She seemed to be the politician elected governments long for. But now she has announced her intention to leave parliament, cabinet and government at the next election. Few shooting stars have climbed so rapidly and fallen so fast. Why? </p> <p>The easy answer is envy. A government whose leaders are intensely conscious of poll ratings, popularity and their own standing cannot tolerate, it is alleged, the presence among them of someone so loved. The explanation, however, is much more complex, and Julia Langdon explores it in a biography that is sympathetic and insightful, but lapses from time to time into repetitive hagiography. The litany of Mowlam's virtues - bright, funny, touchy-feely, direct, blunt, open - is repeated in quotation after quotation from former friends and lovers. The analysis of her colleagues' motives for sidelining and then dropping her is fascinating, but less fully explored. </p> <p>Mo had several counts against her. She came from a family under strain, held together by her determined mother, Tina; her charming and likeable father, Frank, drifted into alcoholism, and shamed his family with his capricious drunken rages. His second child, Mo, coped by escaping into homework. In these difficult circumstances, reminiscent of Bill Clinton's troubled boyhood, she learned how to please people - for she needed both appreciation and affection - and how to protect her own most private feelings. </p> <p>Her earliest ambitions were for academic achievement, and those ambitions took her through school (a good Coventry comprehensive) to the University of Durham, where she was an active and iconoclastic student leader in the turbulent late 1960s, and the University of Iowa, where she took her doctoral degree. It seemed that she was destined for academia. But she was not to be deflected from a political career, and she set about achieving it with determination, returning to to teach first at Newcastle University, and then at an adult education college in Barnsley. Those choices were directly related to her political aspirations. And here she encountered the first hurdle - being a woman. </p> <p>It was never easy for a woman to be selected for a winnable Labour seat; the macho culture of manufacturing industry went deep into Labour's soul. That culture was much stronger in the North than in the South. Mowlam found out during her years of local party involvement in Newcastle that women were expected to organise social events and make the tea. Much the same was true of South Yorkshire. During the miners' strike, she organised help for miners' families, but was not called upon to take a political role. She had, though, made a valuable contact in Charles Clarke, by then head of Neil Kinnock's office, and worked for him during the summer of 1983. </p> <p>Kinnock, who had no reservations about women in public life, admired her. \"Mo is one hell of a lass,\" he told his colleagues. His support encouraged her, but it was a stroke of luck that brought her a safe Labour constituency, Redcar, when its long-standing MP James Tinn decided to retire. </p> <p>In the House of Commons, Mo chose to become one of the lads: direct, blunt and at ease with what Julia Langdon delicately calls \"industrial language\". Her parliamentary pair, Michael Portillo, described her as \"a new sort of MP\". She didn't stay on the back benches long. Ten months after entering parliament, Mo was appointed junior spokeswoman on Northern Ireland. She was clearly being groomed for higher office, and after only 18 months she was moved to a key job in Gordon Brown's Treasury team as City and corporate affairs shadow minister. How well she did that job is a matter of controversy. What became clear was that she did not endear herself to Brown, nor he to her. </p> <p>And this was the second hurdle. For Mowlam was not only a woman, she was an unconventional one. The quotations in Langdon's biography are telling. One unnamed colleague said: \"She doesn't recognise the distance between other people's bodies and her own.\" It wasn't only that she trampled on the conventions - she took delight in doing so. One interview, 11 months after her election as member for Redcar, began with Mowlam declaring to the reporter, Colin Brown of the Independent , \"I've got a new bra on and it's killing me\". She insisted on telling ministerial colleagues that she asked her security police to buy tampons for her. And she made little secret of past lovers, though she made it clear she was no one's parliamentary bimbo. </p> <p>Not everyone was pleased. \"She stands too close when talking to you and uses your Christian name excessively,\" wrote Lynn Barber in the Mail on Sunday in February 1998. She ascribed it to the New Labour style. But that was wrong. It was Kinnock who liked such forthrightness, sometimes amounting to vulgarity; New Labour was altogether more uptight, seeking to establish its respectability in the eyes of the all important middle class. </p> <p>That was why it was surprising that Mo was appointed as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. She had, of course, already been the shadow spokeswoman in opposition, a job she made it clear at the time she did not want. She had established close contacts with many key people in the province - and with many ordinary citizens too. Furthermore, her directness, her warmth and her body language of hugs and embraces was in sharp contrast to the patrician distance adopted by many of her predecessors. She opened up Hillsbrough's gardens for parties, and broke down the barriers between the establishment and the republicans, to the horror of some officials in the Northern Ireland office, who briefed the media against her. </p> <p>Blair's gamble, however, worked. Without Mowlam's reaching out to the nationalist community it is doubtful whether the Good Friday agreement would ever have come about. The tragedy was that her value in bringing in the nationalists offended the unionists - and she was not at all the kind of woman the unionists warmed to. Indeed, few women have played even a minor part in the deliberations of the unionist parties. When the Women's Coalition managed to get two women elected to the Northern Ireland assembly - one Protestant, one Catholic - both were subjected to considerable abuse from fellow Assembly members. </p> <p>So she was at first indispensable, and then, some time towards the autumn of 1998, dispensable. It was clear that David Trimble was no longer prepared to work with her. Tony Blair became, in the words of Peter Mandelson, his own Northern Ireland Secretary. Mowlam was reduced to a secondary role. At a meeting with Blair and Bill Clinton, when the President asked her to sit down and join them, she responded with uncharacteristic bitterness: \"Oh, didn't you know? I'm the new tea lady round here.\" Mandelson, once a close enough friend to be a holiday companion, was now a savage critic. He characterised her as \"terminally undisciplined\": a very New Labour comment. </p> <p>No one can take away Mo Mowlam's achievement, or the impact that her warmth and her courage in the face of serious illness made on a public deeply suspicious of politicians. But she lost the good will of New Labour's quartet of leaders - or else never had it. First there was Gordon Brown, who would not have her on his team after that first shadow post; then there was Peter Mandelson; then Jack Straw, whom she had replaced in 1995 on the National Executive Committee, and who had been chosen by Blair ahead of Mowlam to manage his bid for the leadership. Blair himself was the last to abandon her, offering her the job of Secretary of State for Health in the reshuffle of June 1999. Mowlam, bent on becoming Foreign Secretary, refused. It was probably the greatest mistake of her political life. She believed Brown would have held back funds for the department if she were the minister, but the political imperatives made that unlikely. The post of Foreign Secretary was never a serious possibility. So she ended up with a portentous non-job, that of Cabinet enforcer. After Jack Cunningham's time there, it had begun to look like an ante-room to dismissal. </p> <p>Mowlam is a free spirit, and cannot easily be confined to a message or to a form of behaviour. That is one reason for her immense popularity - she has never distanced herself from ordinary people. Her style once irritated Arthur Scargill, tsar of the Yorkshire miners. Today it irritates Millbank. But it is a style that commends itself to the electors, and to her own party, a hybrid of new and old Labour. </p> <p>I met Mo earlier this year at a breakfast after the Frost programme. She indicated that I should sit beside her. With her usual frankness, she made it clear that life was pretty hellish and that she could not see what her job was about. She feared, however, that her resignation would damage the government's standing with its own supporters. It was one among the many lessons the government has learned painfully in these last few weeks.</p>",
  "<p><strong>A Day in the Death of Joe Egg, Peter Nichols's award-winning play about life with a handicapped child, opened at the Glasgow Citizen's Theatre in 1967, directed by Michael Blakemore. It soon transferred to London's west end. The following summer, Nichols took his wife, Thelma, two younger daughters Louise and Catherine, and son Dan, to New York for the Broadway opening of the play, with Albert Finney in the lead as the child's father. Later that year, other productions were staged in Paris, Rome and Berlin. </strong></p> <p><strong> September 1968</strong> </p> <p>At our hotel beside the Schlosspark-Theater, a sort of annexe of the Schiller, we were met by Boleslaw Barlog, the general intendant of the whole outfit. More photos, capturing us before a poster advertising Ein Tag im Sterben von Joe Egg . The rehearsal was encouraging, though the worst errors weren't obvious at first: one, that the child is played by an adult actress; and two, we couldn't see any affection in the way the parents handled her. </p> <p>The woman doing Joe has made a great effort imitating the physical distortions of a spastic child, a spectacle so repulsive that Herr Barlog has turned her wheelchair to face upstage. All this helps to create an atmosphere not so much homely as horrific. I thought of The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. The achievement of Mike's production was to show the mundane exchanges and routines that constitute life with such a daughter. </p> <p> <strong> January 1969</strong> </p> <p>Peter Medak is the sleepy young Hungarian who'll be directing the Joe Egg film. I showed him \"my\" Bristol, where the action was set, took him to tea with my mother, Grace in the script; toured the undistinguished houses that the teacher-hero could afford to buy and that should be the film location, showed him the usual tourist sights and visited Abigail in her mental hospital, Hortham. </p> <p>Our oldest daughter has declined a great deal since we last saw her nine months ago. Her legs are withering entirely with lack of use. You can almost circle them at the calf with thumb and middle finger. She cried a few times while Thelma nursed her. The other inmates sat in their invalid chairs or on seats around the walls, watching us or busy with their own repetitive gestures. One pretty child rhythmically struck the back of her head against the padded chair-back with a violence that could have been either suicidal or therapeutic. Glum-faced, the sister told us Abo wasn't so well. </p> <p>\"She's going down, I'm afraid.\" </p> <p>I can't say I was overjoyed but certainly felt some cold comfort from knowing she won't have to survive this much longer. Of course, one can't help being haunted by the thought that she feels and knows far more than she can tell. Why else cry so bitterly, sedated and anaesthetised as she is? Is her consciousness like her mother's during her birth? A point I failed to make in the film. This is my last chance to say what I have to on the subject of our poor daughter, whose misfortune has given us a certain fame and a safe future, but who can't share either. </p> <p>Peter and I walked in the grounds while Thelma sat nursing her daughter. Children in the furthest wing were penned behind wire-netting, like zebras in a zoo. </p> <p> <strong> July 17</strong> </p> <p>After breakfast, Thelma left to catch the Bristol train. Abigail nearly died last week and her ward sister asked Thelma to visit. There'd been no detectable pulse for some time and we hourly expected to hear of her death. Uncle Frank, the male nurse, was sent to see her and reported her to be pathetically wasted. We all hoped they wouldn't strive too officiously to keep her alive. </p> <p>I drove to Guy's where Michael Blakemore was joining me for his first glimpse of the operating theatres (for my new play The National Health). His labyrinthine adulteries put him out of touch for some days, while I was eager to work. </p> <p>After garbing in white, we watched a young girl undergoing an operation on her heart. On the anaesthetist's side of the protective screen, her sweet face with the unspoilt child's hair, so healthy after the pallid adult's faces; on the other side, a shambles of blood and puckered flesh. The anaesthetist gently laid his hand on her brow, which I thought a lovely and reassuring gesture, then realised he was noting the pulse in her temple. </p> <p>Poor Abo, our parcel of faulty goods, lives on, despite repeated promises. The doctor who delivered her has never spoken to us from that day to this. The Euthanasia Bill, which I supported, was defeated in the Lords and the Times rejoiced. Our next-door neighbour, Doctor Alan Norton - in his book New Dimensions in Medicine - agrees. In person, he told me it would do more harm than good to alter the vague conditions in which doctors are able to help the dying out of their misery. All right, I argued, but it's in places like Hortham that one looks for courage and mercy from the outside world. What's easier than to sweep those poor idiots under the carpet and forget them? By sustaining such lives, society is relieved of the guilt of their deaths. </p> <p><strong> November 11</strong> </p> <p>For the Bristol home of Bri and Sheila [Joe's parents] in the Egg film, Medak has chosen Freeland Place, a choice Regency location, where only TV producers can afford to live. I went to see Van Eyssen of Columbia, and said it wasn't the best time to discuss the film rights of The National Health as I was very unhappy. He at once rang and ticked them off for prettifying the film. In the morning we heard from Hortham that Abigail's worse again. She can't last much longer, they say. So shall we go down tomorrow, sit by her bed and hope she won't recover yet again? No wonder I've written two plays about sickness and my latest TV play describes a funeral. She'll soon be nine, if she makes it. </p> <p>The unanimous praise in Paris still hadn't managed to attract audiences but now we've been sent an Italian magazine with pictures of the Rome production where the action takes place in a marble palazzo with chandeliers, ornate inlaid ceiling, and old-master paintings. </p> <p>Charles [Wood, the playwright] met us at Temple Meads [a railway station] and drove us in bright sunshine to Hortham hospital, offering a flask of brandy to fortify our spirits. We stayed at our daughter's bedside from 11am to 3.30pm. She can't be moved without causing her to cry. The slightest disturbance hurts and upsets her. The bedclothes were at first pulled up to her chin but, after she'd wet herself, the nurses had to change her sheets and nightdress and there was no hiding the pitiful twisted body. </p> <p>Her ribcage juts through skin stretched like a membrane, merely a bag keeping in the organs. It's muscles that make us attractive. Her thighs are bone with a thin covering of flesh and, everywhere the bones touch the bed, she's sore. One elbow's bandaged. Her legs are doubled up and have to be disposed so as to inflict the minimum discomfort. She made a good deal of noise and cried whenever Thelma moved her too abruptly. </p> <p>In the opposite bed is a pretty girl, some years younger than Abo but obviously damaged in similar ways. Having seen our daughter's decline over the last two years, we know this child will end like her. She has a future only of pain and misery. </p> <p>Some cases are more bearable than these: the hunchback mongol pushing herself about the floor on her knees at least finds a lot to smile about; a fat bald woman in a wheelchair who likes to propel herself; and a handsome boy who's clever enough to go to \"school\", which probably means that hall I visited where they assemble the lids of bubble-blowers. </p> <p>Above these, the slightly happier, are those capable of helping nurse the others, young women obsessed with the hospital's social calendar, bossing one another, flaring into quick resentments. One of 63 was sick of the place and made repeated attempts to walk out during our visit. She could be one of those who were institutionalised, committed here before sedative drugs were common, leave alone psychiatric treatment, so now incapable of making her way in the world. </p> <p>Above the level of capable patients are the nurses themselves, brusque, jocular, doing a job few of us would consider. They content themselves with mundane grumbling about the injustices of hospital admin and their low pay. </p> <p>One of the kids was, we found, the son of a woman who had written to me about Joe Egg, telling me both her children are handicapped. One's at Hortham, one waiting for a place. So much for the lies they told us about disability never striking in the same place twice.In the wire pen, semi-caged humans performed their inexplicable movements. I wanted Harold Hobson to take the guided tour and then look at his notice again. </p> <p>(The critic Hobson had allowed his own experience to distort his view of Joe Egg. He was lame and walked with sticks, due to his parents having trusted Christian Science to cure his infantile polio. He allowed that I'd \"taken a limiting case\", as though I'd gone shopping for it, but thought I had too easily scorned The Laying-On of Hands. \"Miracles do sometimes happen,\" he wrote, then went on to exemplify his own history (presumably) where a doctor had said he'd never be able to earn his living and that child \"went on subsequently to earn about \u00a36,000 a year more than the doctor ever did. But I admit the author has chosen [my italics] an instance graver than this.\") </p> <p>The matron apologised for calling us. </p> <p>\"You never know. She seems to be dead. For days there isn't a even a pulse then suddenly she revives like this.\" </p> <p>We've decided not to visit again until we hear the good news that she's gone. This trip at least convinced Thelma we can't have her home. She can't even bear being moved a few inches but must lie there being fed and bathed and revived by drugs and brandy (yes!) until the mechanism finally overcomes their cruel and crazy efforts to keep it working. Someone give me permission and a painless sedative and I'll kill her without a qualm. </p> <p> <strong> January 14 1970</strong> </p> <p>To Bristol to observe shooting of their picturesque, TV-commercial version of Joe Egg. </p> <p>Medak, in a fur coat, smooth and benign as ever.,\"Some of this stuff is beautiful, doorlink. There is one moment when she brings the baby back from the hospital and she just wipes away a tear ... my God, it's the whole bloody play in one shot!\" </p> <p>But not the play I wrote. </p> <p>I see now what he's turning it into: Georgy Girl with tears. </p> <p>Later at dinner, Trevor Nunn was over-respectful to me and I had no idea how to deal with this as so far the only show of his I'm aware of seeing is Much Ado and didn't much care for it. Surely he couldn't have thought as much of me as he made out. Supporting Janet [Suzman, an actress, Nunn's then wife, who was up for the part in the film] I suppose. </p> <p>\"Oh, Peter,\" he said as we munched our way through the delicious venison, \"what a play! Hw I wish you'd sent it to us first - the Royal Shakespeare!\" </p> <p>\"Oh, Trevor,\" I answered, \"I did. And we didn't even get a reply.\" </p> <p> <strong> May 26</strong> </p> <p>Invited to a Wardour Street viewing-theatre to see the Egg film. I was pleasantly surprised at times, only because my expectations had been so low. Melodrama instead of light comedy. He's denied any possibility of living a decent life with a handicapped child. Of course, the play, too, failed to state that case well enough but at least it tried. I'd have done better to understate the difficulties than exaggerate them. </p> <p> <strong> December 16</strong> </p> <p>Abigail's 10th birthday. Thelma rang Hortham hospital and was told she's unchanged, except that her bedsores have healed. \"A small miracle,\" said the sister. No other miracles to report. They're having a little celebration for her. What, cake? Jelly? Musical chairs? Postman's knock? No crackers, they could start a fit. The only cause for celebration is that she won't know a thing about it. </p> <p> <strong> May 8 1971 </strong> </p> <p>Lovely day. Tennis with [Michael] Frayn at Ranger's House, then with Louise in our garden. A friend came with his son and daughter to watch the Cup Final. Then Bristol hospital was on the line. Not another crisis? It wasn't likely, I thought, as they hadn't bothered us with false alarms for some time now. </p> <p>\"Hullo?\" </p> <p>\"Are you Mister Nichols, the father of Abigail Nichols?\" </p> <p>The professional voice of death. I knew it at once. </p> <p>\"Yes.\" </p> <p>\"Well, I'm sorry to have to inform you that she passed away peacefully at half-past six this evening.\" </p> <p>About an hour ago. We'd been eating. </p> <p>\"Well, in the cirumstances that can only be seen as a good thing.\" </p> <p>We exchanged the obligatory cliches - happy release, blessing all round, end of her suffering, stopping short only at \"good innings\". </p> <p>\"She was seen by Doctor yesterday and there appeared to be nothing unusual. Her chest finally couldn't stand the strain.\" </p> <p>Thelma cried when I told her. For a while I held her in my arms. Louise had already gone to bed complaining that she was ill. I went to see her. </p> <p>\"Abigail's dead,\" she said. </p> <p>\"Yes. I'm glad too, aren't you?\" </p> <p>\"She might be happier in another life after death. If there is one.\" </p> <p>\"She could hardly be less happy, as far as we can see.\" </p> <p>\"If I'd been the first, it could have been me.\" </p> <p>She's always been the most conscious of her eldest sister's existence. </p> <p>We sat in a dazed mood, rang our parents, decided to tell the Frayns and Woods. Thelma suggested putting a notice in the Times. I asked whatever for, as no one knew her, and then only as a disaster. Even we knew only what we'd invented, a personality based on accidental gestures and reflexes. We comforted ourselves with the thought that her state had helped us understand each other and strengthened our marriage. Deepened it even. She dies obscurely, this well-known invalid who had smiled a few times, cried a great deal, never learnt to sit up. Her death had been postponed 11 years by drugs, her fits suppressed, those outward signs of her inner chaos. </p> <p> <strong> May 9</strong> </p> <p>Drove to Bourne End for Tom's (Stoppard's) party. He was pouring wine in the marquee. Entertainments laid on included Punch-and-Judy, a Shetland pony, croquet and the pool. Our girls were soon in the shallow end and the actor John Stride was the only adult to brave the water. </p> <p>Thelma suddenly said, \"Is Lou in trouble?\" I stared at our daughter's face, submerging and surfacing, and thought she'd find her feet in a moment. But Tom moved at once, lay on the side, reached out and pulled her towards him. Stride swam promptly to her aid. I arrived too late to be of any use. Louise cried as her pride took a bruising but was otherwise unhurt. </p> <p>Later, I was watching the conjuror when a sudden splash made me turn in the slow-motion mode that I'd adopted for the day and saw Thelma comforting Catherine. Stride, now fully dressed and soaked to the skin, had jumped in to save her. To lose one daughter may be a misfortune. To stand about while other men save the other two is emblematic of my trance-like incompetence. 2 </p> <p><strong> May 10</strong> </p> <p>Thelma and I joined Joe Melia at the Embassy, Swiss Cottage, to watch the Central School's production of Egg. Those lines about whether the child could outlive 'us' had a new depth and there were moments when I felt like standing and announcing, \"She's dead, ever y one. It's over.\" </p> <p><strong> May 11</strong> </p> <p>Notice in the Times' column of Births, Marriages and Deaths. </p> <p>\"Nichols, Abigail, eldest daughter of Peter and Thelma, at Hortham Hospital, Bristol. Funeral Friday, Canford Cemetery: family flowers only. Donations, if required, to the hospital.\" </p> <p> <strong> May 14</strong> </p> <p>An easy train ride to Bristol. Sat in the Co-op limousine staring out at Clifton college, the Zoo, the Downs, Badminton school and at last Canford, where the hearse was waiting. </p> <p>\"There she is, Mum,\" I said to Thelma, expecting it would be the last time we'd use this manner of speech, invented to give Abigail some character, even to make her falsely articulate. It was a child-size coffin, of course. As we reached the chapel, one of the undertakers whispered, \"Give me a nod when you've stood enough and the coffin will go down.\" </p> <p>What ceremony else? We now doubted whether we'd been right to insist on a non-religious cremation. Should I make a speech? There'd be nothing, no minister or music. </p> <p>We followed the coffin in, borne by four men. Only the box could have weighed much; she had wasted away to nothing with lack of exercise. We were in the front row and behind us our family and two of the nurses who'd cared for her. When the coffin was set in place on the lift, we decided to kneel, a position that at least suggests humility, but to what? To some far-fetched sadist who could have allowed a cruelty like this? </p> <p>I wish now I'd had the guts to stand. But at least it meant that those who were capable of praying were already on their knees. And this occasion wasn't for us but others. I held Thelma's hand very tight as she started giving convulsive sobs. Afterwards she said, \"It was the size of the box.\" When she'd spent her tears, I gave a nod and the coffin sank. </p> <p>I shook hands with the nurses and one said she was lovely and her little heart was strong but she'd at last succumbed when her lung collapsed. She'd even shown signs of knowing them, she said, and I thought \"Not bad for a 10-year-old.\" Nothing anyone said made me feel anything but relief that her long-delayed death had at last been allowed by our clumsy ethics. </p> <p>(During one of our visits to Hortham, I'd asked a nurse if it wouldn't be kinder to let her die. </p> <p>\"But she's a holy innocent,\" she replied, with a smile so sanctimonious I could have hit her. Whatever doctors may feel, their actions are circumscribed by these simple priest-ridden women.) </p> <p>As we drove back, the driver gave a covert wave to a mate of his arriving with the next coffin. </p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Peter Nichols.

Oh all right, it's actually a symposium of essays about how the emerging technology of printing revolutionised the concept of knowledge in Europe. So you get claims that Donne wrote a poem about a \"prototype web-surfer\" and references to the \"early modern search engine\" (the paratextual apparatus of marginalia, indices and so on).

Here it is argued that since we are more geographically fluid, our friends take on ever more of the old functions of family members: the bonds of trust and love thus demanded make modern friendship ever more complex and potentially rewarding. Pahl, a warmly readable sociologist (I know, that looks oxymoronic, but trust me), muses over ideas of friendship found in thinkers such as Aristotle, La Rochefoucauld and Hume, and also those implied in literature and modern fiction.

  "<p>\u0095 Was Booker Prize chair Simon Jenkins's appearance at Jeanette Winterson's launch - held at Gordon Brown's wedding party venue, the Jerwood Space Gallery - a foretaste of the eagerly awaited shortlist, revealed next week? Those looking for clues in a noticeably leak-free year might wonder, but the connection was (probably) innocuous, both authors having appeared The Word festival. One participant not present was Michael Heseltine, whose tete-\u00e0-tete with his Henley successor, Boris Johnson, was cancelled due to lack of interest. The only explanation the Loafer can come up with for this ignominious no-show is that Heseltine, as a new member of the literati, had opted for one of the evening's other parties - hosted by Maeve Binchy and Barbara Windsor. </p> <p> \u0095 The extravagantly bearded Joseph Connolly, a charming addition to any gathering, is in hot water over the convergence of fiction and reality in his latest novel, It Can't Go On. It's one thing to create a drunken, boorish character, quite another to make him the employee of a real-life institution. The thoroughly upright Manchester Building Society has taken issue with its appearance in a trendy metropolitan novel - it doesn't even have a London office, for heaven's sake! - and is currently considering having recourse to the law. The last time the Loafer encountered Mr Connolly he was in fine fettle, having returned home from an evening's sport at 7am, showing no sign of fatigue - from which one might infer that this little difficulty is unlikely to strike the fear of God into him. </p> <p> \u0095 An early entry for the most entertainingly fatuous jacket puff of the year.

Donaghy, as even his friends will testify, has trouble with a slice of toast, so the results might be interesting.

  "<p><strong> Enlightenment: Britain and the Creation of the Modern World</strong></p> <p> Roy Porter </p> <p>752pp, Viking</p> <p> \u00a325 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501842470,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> <br></p> <p> The past is not just another country but a whole continent, countries pressing against each other like nation states on the map of the mind. From a distance, the labels are convenient; the borders seem clear. The problems start as you try to zoom in closer. People on one side of a divide dress, behave and bicker remarkably like they do on the other. History's judgments begin to seem less certain, more forced. Is a term like \"British Enlightenment\" an oxymoron? What does it mean to say that people in periwigs created the modern world more than 200 years ago, before electricity, before emancipation, before revolution? </p> <p>Part of the power of Roy Porter's new book is that you stop asking questions like that in the first chapter. People of the 18th century knew they were enlightened. \"There is a mighty light which spreads itself over the world, especially in those two free Nations of England and Holland,\" wrote the Earl of Shaftesbury early in the century. He wasn't talking about a comet, but \"the establishment of an intire philosophicall Liberty\". Gibbon called England \"his free and enlightened country\", and Tom Paine, who designed smokeless candles as well as a revolutionary state of mind, said: \"What we have to do is as clear as light.\" </p> <p>Such a statement wasn't just metaphor. France may have had a Sun King, but Newton's Opticks represented a scientific discovery of light. \"God said, let Newton be!\" wrote Pope, \"and all was light.\" Enlightenment was also literal truth: the urban English were brighter than other people. \"In Oxford-street alone there are more lamps than in all of Paris,\" wrote an astonished Prussian. And the British went on improving their vision: though he was created by an Irishman, Lemuel Gulliver, Porter points out, was English literature's first bespectacled hero. </p> <p>But these instances are just sparks struck off the anvil of Porter's argument, that there was indeed a British Enlightenment (there was never any argument about the lumi\u00e8res or illuminati across the Channel). After the bloodshed, religious bigotry, witch-burning and political upheavals of the 17th century, something had changed. </p> <p>\"In France we cringe to the great, in England the great cringe to the people,\" said a pithy Frenchwoman. The meritocracy had arrived, and with it a kind of limited democracy that Porter calls \"inclusiveness\". Some of this was more metropolitan than national, and one agency of this inclusiveness was the coffee house, where wits and thinkers used debating societies, gazettes and journals to brew not just business or commerce but a culture of openness. </p> <p>\"We are become a Nation of Statesmen,\" said the Craftsman magazine. \"Our Coffee-Houses and Taverns are full of them.\" It must indeed have been something to repair to the Turk's Head in Gerrard Street, Soho, and hear Samuel Johnson presiding over gatherings that included Oliver Goldsmith, Joshua Reynolds, David Garrick, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Edward Gibbon and Adam Smith. And there were other agencies of change more powerful still: the pleasure gardens, the museums (the British Museum was founded by an act of parliament in 1753) and the theatre (Gay's Beggar's Opera was seen by more than 40,000 people in its first season in 1728). Then there were the rigours of science after Newton, and the appeals to reason of the philosophers Locke and Hume. </p> <p>The 18th century of Addison, Steele, Defoe and Swift was also hack heaven. Between 1660 and 1800, more than 300,000 books and pamphlets were printed and sold - perhaps 200 million copies. Modern print culture was invented then: one entrepreneur (whose Finsbury Square headquarters boasted the sign \"Cheapest Booksellers In the World\") turned over 100,000 volumes a year by inventing the art of remaindering. </p> <p>The newspapers took coffee-house wit to county towns. The Salisbury Journal sold 4,000 copies, more than most Paris newspapers. Print had become the dynamo of change. This was the world of Grub Street and Henry Fielding's hack Blotpage; of the novel and that new breed \"author by trade\"; of publishing deals, partworks and paperbacks, children's books, how-to-do-it books and circulating libraries. What circulated above all were ideas. \"It is with great pleasure I observe,\" said David Hume, \"that men of the world are proud of borrowing from books their most agreeable topics of conversation.\" </p> <p>Among these ideas were tolerance, generosity and that favourite word of the era, reason. Locke talked of \"the reasonableness of Christianity\"; Newton had established a physical universe capable of being understood by reason. Could God's laws be different? And if religion was rational, and basic truths plain, what justification could there be for compulsion? Tolerance prepared men to look in all directions. Captain Cook - surely the perfect exemplar of his century's mental mobility and decency, for he joined the Royal Navy at 28 as an able seaman and rose to become the greatest navigator of all - began the first serious study of Polynesian language and culture, and started to dismantle both romantic and dismissive attitudes to \"savagery\". In 1772, the law turned against slavery in Britain, and attitudes in Britain turned against slavery itself. Mary Astell in 1700 asked the other great question: \"If all Men are born free, how is it that all Women are born slaves?\" </p> <p>This was the century that interpreted the planet as a kind of self-sustaining, cyclic, terrestrial system, that began the process of systematic mastery of wilderness and saw the economy of nature as there to finance the march of mankind. \"Three fourths of the habitable globe are now uncultivated,\" complained William Godwin, but already the begetters of the agricultural revolution had begun the process of making two blades of grass grow where one grew before. And this was a century of an insular self-satisfaction that echoes our own: \"With what joy and gratitude must every Englishman reflect on the happiness of his own nation in comparison of any other,\" said a traveller back from Lisbon in 1775. </p> <p>This headlong, heady book takes hold as Henry V took Harfleur - by storm, and with some great phrases. Porter doesn't so much argue as hammer home his brilliantly selected evidence. The marvellous anti-Enlightenment figures of Blake and Coleridge are also among the makers of modern Britain, but somehow Porter accommodates them. Occasionally, you wonder rebelliously whether someone so much the master of his material could not just as deftly have produced an entirely different thesis, with different, equally dazzling quotations. Every now and then he makes modern parallels - the daily post with email, Restoration theatre with television, Christian economists with Thatcherism -that jar a little. Yet the only real complaint is that this book feels about 500 pages too short. </p> <p>The era ended in reaction: evangelical, political, romantic, conformist. \"Oh God, teach him to think like other people,\" said Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, child of the Enlightenment, of her son by Percy Shelley. She sent him to Harrow. \"He rose without trace to become a member of Parliament and, reassuringly, a conformist nonentity,\" says Porter. The great adventure, not so much in thought as in thinking, came to a close with \"a mad monarch, with enlightened men like Hazlitt mourning the triumph of unreason, and with Swift's ghost cackling in the background\".</p>",
  "<p>An unprecedented set of hearings into the future of genetically modified crops begins on Monday, heralding 10 weeks of embarrassing allegations of failures in the government's handling of the introduction of the new technology into British agriculture. </p> <p>Pressure to exert stricter control over the biotech companies will be put on ministers by anti-GM groups and individual protesters, who forced the hearings, to cost \u00a3500,000, by exploiting previously unused official procedures laid down by 1982 seeds regulations to object to plans from a GM company, Aventis, to market commercially Chardon LL, a modified feed maize for cattle. </p> <p>Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, has indicated he is ready to give permission; if he decides to do so next year, a far more expensive legal battle involving a high court judge is likely. Success for Aventis in getting a national seeds listing for its product, the last legal hurdle it faces, would bring applications from other companies anxious to be ready for the market once farm trials are complete in 2003. Some 68 groups and individuals, all except Aventis against the proposal, have each paid a total of \u00a390 to gain the right to public hearings. Some are calling expert witnesses. On Monday they will be handed 30kg (66lb) of written evidence submitted to the hearings, for which a timetable will then be set. </p> <p>The hearings will be held over six weeks at a hotel in Hammersmith, west London, with a further four at University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. A further 220 objectors paid \u00a330 to lodge their protests in writing.</p>",
  "The truth about the Conservatives' leader is to emerge on the eve of their party conference. William Hague is not the hardline populist of his family. His father, Nigel, admits to being far worse. <p>In a revealing portrait on Channel 4 tomorrow night, the Tory leader emerges as startlingly self-confident - devoted to Yorkshire and his wife, Ffion, in that order. A stickler for punctuality, he believes he can win the coming election, and he does not blame the media for his image problems - \"It's like living with the weather.\" </p> <p>Stella, his famously sensible mother, is seen in the kitchen saying: \"I think William's much more tolerant than his father.\" She describes Nigel Hague, the soft drink entrepreneur whose deliverymen set his son on the road to that 14-pint binge, as non-political and sports mad. </p> <p>Nigel chips in to explain: \"I'm a hang and plug 'em brigade ... \" before Stella cuts him off with: \"We don't want that on television.\" </p> <p>His mother also explains the family thought that William, the youngest by six years, would grow out of his politics craze after his precocious 1977 speech to the Tory conference, or \"swing the other way\" when he went to Oxford. </p> <p>The Tory leader's three older sisters also appear in Charlotte Metcalf's film, Just William ... and Ffion. Veronica, the one who dubbed William \"Tory Pig\" when he became a teenage political anorak in the 1970s, is seen describing a meeting of fellow rightwingers as a \"yawner\". She also says she will go to see her brother at the conference because \"I think this might be the last chance. How can I put this politely?\" </p> <p>Her sister-in-law, Ffion, is loyally supportive of her spouse but clearly not keen on the camera's intrusion. She does not say much. Asked if it was it love at first sight, she replies: \"You can't ask things like that.\" </p> <p>Unexpectedly, the friends Mr Hague volunteered for inspection by the TV crew turn out to be David Risby, the farmer with whom he went to school (who sold his Hague wedding photos to the Mail) and Doreen Whitehead, a cheerful matron and proprietor of the Mother Goose B&amp;B at Swaledale, the Hagues' favourite beauty spot. </p> <p>Hague aides in London appear frequently, but the shadow cabinet is conspicuous by its absence; apparently its filmed sessions were too boring. As a consequence the film is long on Yorkshire and laughter (he makes good jokes), but short on political philosophy. </p> <p>Charlotte Metcalf is a self-confessed Labour supporter who once made a party broadcast for Tony Blair, but Mr Hague will be pleased with her film. How viewers react may depend on their politics or on their attitude to alcohol. More drink is cheerfully consumed in the Hague circle than any leader has thought wise to show on camera since Churchill smoked and drank his way to victory in 1945. </p> <p>Sister Veronica has the best joke. Discussing cars around the family table (William seems ignorant), she waspishly asks: \"What's the difference between a Range Rover and a porcupine? The porcupine has the pricks on the outside.\" </p> <p>There goes the Range Rover vote.</p>",
  "The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, last night piled the agony on Ulster Unionists when he announced that convicted terrorists who had escaped custody and fled abroad would no longer be pursued. <p>They can return home and apply for early release under terms similar to the Good Friday agreement, which saw more than 420 paramilitary prisoners released ahead of schedule. The Northern Ireland Office believes none will serve more than a month. </p> <p>There are 21 fugitives who will benefit, all republicans. Sinn Fein had been pushing for the initiative, but the NIO denied suggestions this week that it planned such a move. </p> <p>Ulster Unionists were shocked. They were already furious at the announcement by the RUC chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, that six army bases in Co Fermanagh were to be demolished despite dissident republican terrorist activity in border areas. </p> <p>The army also said yesterday it wanted to cut troop levels - at 13,500, the lowest since 1970 - to 8,000 as long as the peace process continued intact. Any reductions were dependent on a diminishing terrorist threat to security. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson's move threatened further the Good Friday agreement. Jeffrey Donaldson, the Ulster Unionist seen as a likely successor to David Trimble as leader, stepped up demands for a party summit to vote on immediate withdrawal from the province's power-sharing executive. </p> <p>Mr Donaldson, prompted by the party's catastrophic byelection defeat to the Democratic Unionists last week in Antrim South, would be likely to win such a poll at the Ulster Unionist council. That would spell the end of Mr Trimble's five-year leadership. </p> <p>Mr Donaldson said: \"Mr Mandelson says he recognises the hurt this announcement on jailed terrorists will cause. I don't think he has an idea. There is no provision at all for this amnesty in the agreement. </p> <p>\"There comes a point in the Unionist community when we have to say we won't be suckered any longer.\" </p> <p>Ian Paisley Jr, a Democratic Unionist assembly member, said: \"It is an unbelievably pathetic sop to the IRA. It shows whose exactly whose side Mr Mandelson is on.\" </p> <p>Mr Mandelson denied that the development represented an amnesty. He believed it would not be in the public interest to pursue the terrorists. </p> <p>It means that four IRA men who escaped from the Maze prison in 1983 can call off their long legal battle against extradition from the US. Two more Maze escapees living in the Irish Republic can also abandon their struggle against extradition. </p> <p>Liam Averill, now 35, who escaped from the Maze in December 1997 after dressing as a woman at a Christmas party, is now able to return from the republic. He served little over two years for murdering two men in Garvagh, Co Londonderry, in 1994. </p> <p>Three members of the M60 gang who fled from Crumlin Road courthouse the day before they were convicted for shooting dead Captain Herbert Westmacott, 28, in north Belfast in May 1980 are also thought to qualify. Two are fighting extradition in the republic. </p> <p>Nessan Quinlivan will also benefit. He escaped with co-accused Pearse McCauley from Brixton prison in London in July 1991 while on remand on charges linked to a murder campaign in England. </p> <p>The NIO said the move was the logical next step to the early release scheme, which has led to more than 420 convicted terrorists walking free from the Maze well ahead of schedule. </p> <p>The prison, once home to 1,800 inmates, was empty for the first time last night after the last dozen prisoners were transferred and 400 more officers left the service. </p> <p>The NIO claimed that all of those on the list would serve no more than a month or so if they returned and applied to the sentence review commissioners. But, under the rules of the agreement, the three members of the M60 gang should have to serve a minimum of two years.</p>",
  "A major review of how sport is run and funded is to take place over the coming weeks in an attempt to build on the success of the British Olympic team, which has had one of its most successful games. <p>With the Olympic flame due to be put out at tomorrow's closing ceremony, British sports officials in Sydney are desperate to ensure that the momentum generated by the success of the team is not lost in post-Olympic euphoria. </p> <p>By last night Great Britain had won 23 medals, including eight golds - the most golds since the 1924 Paris games. </p> <p>National lottery funding has been identified as one of the main reasons for this success. </p> <p>Yvonne McGregor, who won a bronze in cycling, said if it had not been for lottery funding she would not have been in the sport. McGregor was able to give up her job as a youth worker to concentrate on cycling two years ago. </p> <p>She said: \"I would not have had any success if it had not been for national lottery funding. I was having difficulty making ends meet until the world class performance programme provided for my day to day existence.\" </p> <p>The rower James Cracknell, who won gold in the men's coxless fours, also pinpointed lottery funding as one of the main reasons for his success. </p> <p>Cracknell said: \"It has made a massive difference and has allowed me to concentrate on my sport and even eat properly.\" </p> <p>The rower was signing on the dole and training until the world class programme intervened allowing him to concentrate full-time on sport. </p> <p>Under the current system, those who have been identified as elite athletes are funded by the programme, which this year received \u00a320.5m from the national lottery. </p> <p>The programme, launched in 1997, has administered about \u00a380m to athletes and their governing bodies. Currently 730 athletes receive funding from the programme. Those in the world top 20 can receive an income of around \u00a315,000 a year. Other costs for equipment, training camps and medical treatment are also met, and funds are given to sports' governing bodies for hiring coaches and constructing facilities. </p> <p>The government has assured British sport that there will be no cuts in the programme's budgets following forecasts that lottery income will fall over the coming years. </p> <p>The sports minister, Kate Hoey, said: \"No lottery funding will be cut and the current amount of money in the world class performance programme will be maintained even if income from the sale of national lottery tickets goes down. The government is determined to build on the success of the British team.\" </p> <p>But although the funding programme has paid off for cyclists, rowers and athletes, other sports have not benefited as well. Swimmers, hockey players and gymnasts have failed miserably, and the inquests have already begun as to why. </p> <p>Hockey has received just over \u00a310m of national lottery money since 1997 but performed poorly in Sydney, the men losing 8-1 to Pakistan. Officials have privately said they might have performed better with the help of sports psychologists, as many of the players suffered from nerves. </p> <p>Swimming has received just over \u00a36m. But officials still protest that they are battling against poor infrastructure and suffering from long-term under-investment before 1997. Britain has only 19 50-metre Olympic size pools, fewer than the Australian state of Queensland. </p> <p>David Sparkes, chief executive of the Amateur Swimming Federation, said: \"We are very disappointed at the performance of the British swimming team. Many swimmers did not perform close to their best and our athletes just did not have the toughness. </p> <p>\"Lottery money has made a difference but we were starting way behind other sports. Rowing has benefited from better facilities and the determination of those involved in it to become the best, while athletics received sponsorship money even before national lottery funding. </p> <p>\"I hope that our funding will not be cut. We have been struggling from underfunding for a number of years and I have always said that you will begin to see the true benefits of lottery money at the 2004 games in Athens.\" </p> <p>All sports which have taken part in the Sydney games will be asked to submit performance reports to UK Sport, the body that administers funding for the world class programme. </p> <p>Before the games, Olympic sports that received national lottery funding were asked to set targets for medals won. Clearly, some will have a lot of explaining to do; swimming, for example, predicted that it would win 10. </p> <p>Pressure is increasing on the sports that failed to win anything and UK Sport has hinted that they might have their lottery money cut. </p> <p>There is a growing feeling that money should be focused on a limited number of sports that have already had success. Rowing, for example, could be in line for more money while hockey might have its funding cut. Liz Nicholl, director of performance services at UK Sport, said: \"All sports will be reviewed and we will be asking them to set targets for 2004. </p> <p>\"We have to have a major think on how we can best develop the programme over the coming years. Perhaps the programme needs to be a bit more focused and concentrate on certain sports. Maybe we are spreading ourselves too thinly.\" </p> <p>Table tennis has received more than \u00a33m of national lottery money but it was clear that it stood little chance of winning medals at Sydney. But it is hoped that dividends will be paid in the long term. </p> <p>UK Sport has already raised Britain's target of reaching the top 15 in the Sydney medals table to the top 10 next time round. All eyes will be on the 2004 games in Athens. </p> <p><b>The price of success</b></p> <p>Funding since 1997 when the world class performance programme began: </p> <p><b> Athletics</b> six medals, \u00a39,204,886 </p> <p><b> Badminton</b> one medal, \u00a34,867,949 </p> <p><b> Canoe/Kayak slalom</b> one medal, \u00a34,507,093 </p> <p><b> Cycling</b> four medals, \u00a34,999,420 </p> <p><b> Equestrian </b> one medal, \u00a32,476,850 </p> <p><b> Judo</b> one medal, \u00a33,749,628 </p> <p><b> Rowing</b> three medals \u00a39,598,048 </p> <p><b> Sailing</b> three medals, \u00a35,138,765 </p> <p><b> Shooting</b> two medals, \u00a3291,894 </p> <p><b> Boxing </b> one medal, \u00a3559,040 </p> <p><b> Swimming</b> no medals, \u00a36,035,015 </p> <p><b> Triathalon</b> no medals, \u00a31,180,437 </p> <p><b> Diving</b> no medals, \u00a3780,123 </p> <p><b> Hockey</b> no medals, \u00a310,948,675 </p> <p><b> Table tennis</b> no medals, \u00a33,274,454 </p> <p><b> Weightlifting</b> no medals, \u00a3138,810 111111</p>",
  "The inquiry into alleged links between an undercover army unit and loyalist paramilitary assassins in Northern Ireland has uncovered evidence of \"institutional collusion\" that went unchecked for years, security sources have told the Guardian. <p>Operating in a \"maverick\" fashion, the force research unit, a covert intelligence cell that handled agents in the province in the 1980s and 90s, gradually \"lost the plot\", investigators say. </p> <p>FRU recruited informers against the express orders of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which officially had the lead role in such operations, and allowed agents to \"run the army, not the other way round\". </p> <p>With the help of hundreds of previously undisclosed army documents known as \"secret books\", the inquiry team, led by Sir John Stevens, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, has identified between 20 and 25 former members of the FRU. It regards them as key to exposing the extent and na ture of the collaboration. The Guardian has learned that two former members of FRU, both junior ranking soldiers still serving in the army, were interviewed by inquiry detectives last week. One flew back from Germany; the other was in the UK. Next week, Sir John's team will interview two more. One is stationed in Kosovo, the second in the UK. </p> <p>Detectives intend to \"work their way up\" the ranks of FRU, before speaking to its former commander, Brigadier John Kerr - referred to as \"Mr Intelligence\" - who is the British military attache in Beijing. Sir John has steadfastly refused to speak about the 18-month inquiry and Ministry of Defence sensitivity has led Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, to obtain gagging orders against newspapers. </p> <p>But security sources have revealed that the 20-strong team is slowly pushing forward and that a report with its findings will be written in the new year. </p> <p>The team's remit was to re-investigate the murders of Pat Finucane, a well-known defence solicitor shot by the Ulster Defence Association in February 1989, and 19-year-old Adam Lambert, who was shot the day after the IRA blew up 11 people at Enniskillen in November 1987. </p> <p>An RUC informer, William Stobie, 49, has been charged with offences relating to both killings and is awaiting trial. </p> <p>The Stevens team does not believe that FRU soldiers were working from a \"guidebook\" telling them how to deal with informers. However, police officers have identified important flaws in the way the unit was operating that allowed them too much freedom. </p> <p>FRU, which had its own headquarters, was supposed to act as a conduit for intelligence gathered from informers recruited by the army rather than the RUC. </p> <p>Meetings between FRU agents and informers were recorded on contact forms - CFs. The CF forms were turned into \"Mispers\" - military intelligence reports -which were supposed to have been delivered to RUC special branch. </p> <p>A source said: \"The RUC had primacy over FRU. They should have been given everything. It seems this didn't happen.\" </p> <p>The RUC also had power of veto over any informers that FRU wanted to recruit, but its advice was ignored. </p> <p>Another problem was that the FRU's three departments - east, north and west - did not work cohesively. </p> <p>Sir John has been told that his officers now have \"severe concerns about the management and meaningful level of control\" within FRU and have told him that the systems for handling agents were \"not robust enough\" and \"do not stand up to scrutiny\". </p> <p>An example of the \"institutional collusion\" was the handling of Brian Nelson, an informer recruited by FRU against the advice of both MI5 and the RUC special branch. </p> <p>Nelson, the Ulster Defence Association's intelligence officer, was sentenced to 10 years in 1992 on 20 charges, including conspiracy to murder. Because he pleaded guilty, the full extent of his collusion with FRU was never put before a court. </p> <p>Sir John's team is convinced that a deal was cut to protect the army and that if details had been dislosed then, the current investigation would not have been necessary. </p> <p>\"Nelson's job was to target people,\" said a security source. \"This is a high-risk strategy.\" His aim was to \"wipe out half of IRA command\". Sir John's team is also understood to be convinced that a fire which wrecked his offices during an earlier investigation into collusion was not an accident. </p> <p>An investigation by the RUC after the fire in January 1990 concluded it had been started accidentally, though there have been persistent rumours that it was arson carried out by army intelligence personnel fearful of the evidence that was being uncovered. </p> <p>One former FRU soldier, who uses the alias Martin Ingram, has been a valuable witness for the Stevens team, according to security sources. </p> <p>As a result of complaints by senior army officers anxious to suppress disclosures about FRU activities, a man they believe to be Ingram is the subject of a police special branch investigation in connection with possible charges under the Official Secrets Act for disclosing information to a newspaper. </p> <p>Scotland Yard refused last night to discuss the continuing investigation or give details of the former FRU soldiers interviewed last week.</p>",
  "Thirty-thousand feet up and three hours from Moscow, the no-smoking lights went off and the stampede began. A late booking had left me no option but to settle for a smoking perch at the back of the Aeroflot 350-seater. A smoker myself, I had no objection. But then came the invasion of the child-smokers. <p>Two groups of wealthy Muscovite teenagers, on their way home from a school trip to London, were on board. They swarmed to the back by the dozen, chucking packets of Marlboro across the rows. The seat beside me was vacant - momentarily. Three youths piled into it simultaneously, puffing away in my face. </p> <p>The obligatory bossy babushka on board went ballistic. \"Young woman, young woman, you shouldn't be smoking. You're too young.\" True, the girl looked about 10. The OAP was greeted with a sneer. The flight assistants were summoned to sort out the melee. They shrugged and walked away. </p> <p>It's not to everyone's liking, but to my mind, being able to have a fag on a four-hour flight is one of Aeroflot's redeeming features. The airline clearly agrees and is resolved to defend the freedom to light up more or less on demand. </p> <p>In a country where civil liberties seem to come and go on the whim of whoever is occupying the Kremlin, the Russian can depend on a few inalienable rights - vodka and tobacco are the fixtures. They are also, of course, the big killers. </p> <p>More than one in three of the population - children included - smoke. The rich pickings from this colossal market is a boon for the global tobacco giants in disrepute in the west. But if one kind of American is keen to see Marlboro Man thrive in Russia, another kind - health-obsessed and politically correct - is Aeroflot's problem. More specifically, I am referring to Bill Clinton. </p> <p>Last April the US president banned smoking on flights leaving from or arriving in America. But according to the thunderings of Aeroflot this week, this ban is a breach of international law and the principle of national sovereignty. </p> <p>\"We are capable of deciding ourselves whether or not our passengers are allowed to smoke on flights,\" said Aeroflot's top lawyer, Boris Yeliseyev. \"This is also an intrusion into the economic activities of foreign companies outside the US.\" </p> <p>Aeroflot said it was appealing to the International Air Transport Association to put the White House back in its box and have the ban lifted. </p> <p>But if the Americans are keeping Russians from smoking, the reverse, it seems, is also true - American Big Tobacco is killing Russians. No less a figure than Vladimir Kozhin, a close aide to non-smoking President Vladimir Putin, has just filed a suit in the same Florida court that recently ordered the tobacco companies to shell out $145bn (\u00a3100bn) in damages to US smokers. </p> <p>What's good for the Yankee goose is just as good for the Russian gander. \"Russia's expenses amount to millions if not billions of dollars,\" the Kremlin claim stated. </p> <p>The smoke-filled vodka-soaked room is the standard setting for political deals in Moscow. But maybe that's changing under the beady, abstemious eye of Mr Putin. </p> <p>Taking their cue, perhaps, from the asceticism of the new boss - a far cry from the bibulous heyday of Boris Yeltsin - the duma, or lower house, recently voted by a huge majority to ban smoking in the chamber. </p> <p>It seemed an utterly uncharacteristic nod to clean living. But then, Alexei Mitrofanov, one of the clownish extremists who adorn the duma, explained that the vote was directed not at the Russians, but at the wicked Americans. </p> <p>\"It's part of a larger campaign against the western tobacco monopolies that control the Russian market,\" he reasoned.</p>",
  "The most important power base of Slobodan Milosevic is now under serious threat after the far-right Radical party, which rules Serbia in coalition with the Milosevic regime, offered its support to the opposition. <p>It emerged yesterday that the Radical leader, Vojislav Seselj, contacted the opposition directly and offered his help. The move opens up a real possibility of overthrowing Mr Milosevic's hold on his legislative power base within the Serbian republic government by the end of this year. </p> <p>The Radicals are the most strident force in Yugoslav politics and their support for the Democratic Opposition of Serbia marks a major political shift. </p> <p>Mr Seselj is a former paramilitary, active during the war in Bosnia. He is famous in Belgrade for waving a gun on the streets on more than one occasion. Most recently, he threatened local journalists, saying they should be \"liquidated\". </p> <p>The Radicals are in the republican government of Serbia with the Socialist party of Slobodan Milosevic and the Yugoslav Left party of his wife, Mira Markovic. </p> <p>Mr Seselj, a highly intelligent man who came top of his class at law school in Belgrade, appears to be a populist, but he is also a political survivor. Many people label him, above all, a \"fascist\". </p> <p>The Radicals' support for Mr Kostunica's coalition is all the more surprising because the blocs were rivals in the election. But soon after the opposition and the Centre for Freedom and Democracy (Cesid) announced their results - both independently declaring Mr Kostunica the winner - the Radicals corroborated the claims with their results. </p> <p>The Radicals' own presidential candidate, Zoran Nikolic, performed miserably. </p> <p>Mr Seselj publicly recognised Mr Kostunica as president on Thursday. He congratulated him and sent a formal letter. </p> <p>Opposition sources say that Mr Seselj also offered the Kostunica camp political help because of the Radicals' power base in the Serbian republic's government. </p> <p>However, Mr Seselj is said to have pointed out that he is a pragmatic politician and explained that he would want something in return for his backing now. </p> <p>The Radicals have in recent days been going back dramatically on their past deeds. Mr Seselj, who signed the order for police to storm the Studio B television studio in May, has now called on Studio B to be brought back under the control of Belgrade city hall. </p> <p>He has called for a repeal of the information law which gagged journalists and newspapers - even though it was a law which he personally wrote. </p> <p>He is also calling for changes in the law governing the state newspaper, Politika. An attack on this by non-regime forces would deny Mr Milosevic a monopoly on information. </p> <p>Mr Seselj and his party have the power to provoke a crisis in the republic's government - but it may be that they decide to stay in government and to work against Mr Milosevic from within. </p> <p>\"It's easy to bring down a government, but we are not in a hurry,\" Mr Seselj said yesterday. </p> <p>Another key political party at republican level is the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) of Vuk Draskovic. His party suffered a terrible drubbing at the federal elections because of his failure to back the Kostunica coalition. </p> <p>He has admitted the error and has congratulated Mr Kostunica. The SPO is currently boycotting republic government sessions, but if it chooses to work with the Radicals, their joint representation in parliament could politically smash the regime at republic level. They could form a government together or, more likely, force republic elections. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica's coalition has made it clear that it wants republican elections by the end of the year. Mr Seselj has so far shown every indication that he will help the opposition to achieve this.</p>",
  "Margaret Thatcher was still in opposition when Mary Gregson locked up her pretty stone cottage at Jane Hills, near Bradford, and set off along the towpath to mop the floors at Sir Titus Salt's vast alpaca-spinning mill half a mile away. <p>She had not gone far when she was grabbed, beaten, raped and finally strangled by a man she had never met, who leapt from the thick groves of balsam and scrub which separated the canal from the river Aire. </p> <p>He may have been seen; a frustratingly vague witness told police of seeing a man bending over a recumbent woman on the fatal evening of August 30 1977. </p> <p>But Mary's husband, Bill, and 11-year-old son, Tom, were to wait in vain for the \"good as gold\" mother to turn up, cheerily as usual. </p> <p>A much longer wait began for a shy and awkward young labourer, Ian Lowther, who had watched Mrs Gregson's regular-as-clockwork habits from a building site just along the canal. For the next 22 years he lived with the secret knowledge that he was the man, fired by drink and the simple opportunity, who had ambushed the cleaner and shocked the community where she and he had lived just a few miles apart. </p> <p>Though quiet in the evening, the towpath was - and is - a favourite cycle route and a place to stroll while the Shipley waterbus putters almost as slowly past. </p> <p>Lowther picked his moment cunningly, and - self-confident after an early interview with detectives, who rapidly tracked down every man on the built-up stretch of the canal between Salt's and the inland revenue's pyramid-roofed offices at Shipley - he chose a cover straight out of whodunnit books. He settled nearby, found a wife, helped to raise a child and took a succession of undemanding but steady jobs. </p> <p>If Mary Gregson was \"respectable\", a phrase repeated every time the killing's anniversary came round, or Bradford police tried another reconstruction, Lowther was \"so normal he was boring\". Such phrases from neighbours in Baildon, a village that climbs up the steep hill from Shipley to the Ilkley moor, were echoed by another man who waited and waited. </p> <p>\"Lowther was quiet, kept himself to himself, lived an ordered life and was meticulous in his habits,\" said Brian Taylor, a detective on the case from the baffled beginning to the triumphant end. \"Other police described him as quiet, reserved, even a nice man.\" </p> <p>Mr Taylor, who went from sergeant to detective superintendent during the long wait for Gregson's killer, knew he had a crucial card in what seemed a killing bereft of decent clues. In the forlorn bundle of clothing that belonged to Gregson, soaked by the river and increasingly old and deteriorating, there was the vital, though tiny, semen stain. </p> <p>Mr Taylor's original boss, John Domaille, had commissioned scientific tests on the forensic evidence in 1977, but they established nothing helpful. </p> <p>Further analysis was tried in 1988 and 1995, when DNA testing became part of the British police force armoury, but the scans were too crude; the fragment of cell material still refused to yield a profile. </p> <p>The detective was following forensic developments though, and he kept his evidence secure as scientists' dismantling of genetic material became ever more fine. </p> <p>A man was jailed at Liverpool crown court in 1999 for the murder of another woman, Cynthia Bolshaw, 16 years before, after specks of DNA evidence were tested with a new refinement - SGM - which can unlock the vital pattern from a single cell. Mr Taylor's men and women were out in Shipley with hundreds of swab sampling kits, and Lowther was on their \"previously interviewed\" list. </p> <p>He was alone at his ordinary, pass-in-a-blink, Baildon semi when they arrived; his marriage had brought him four grandchildren but had run out of steam a year earlier. </p> <p>Within a few days routine check number 532 (voluntary by law, but Lowther's self-confidence was 22 years' strong) had the Gregson team staring at one another in disbelief. </p> <p>Mr Taylor said yesterday: \"There was a heck of a lot of swabbing going on. We'd just about got to 600 and there was another 2,000 or 2,500 still to be done. To say that we were elated is something of an understatement.\" </p> <p>It was too late, however, for some of those most affected. In 1981 Bill Gregson died of a heart attack on the exact spot his wife was killed during one of his regular visits to the site. Nor did his wife's parents ever find out who robbed them of their daughter, and their grandson, Michael, who is now 34 and still living locally, of his mother.</p>",
  "Dramatic advances in DNA technology and police tenacity led to a \"shy and placid\" van driver starting a life sentence yesterday for sexually assaulting and strangling a mother in an opportunist attack 23 years ago. <p>Microscopic analysis of a small amount of semen cells in a tiny stain on the victim's clothes betrayed the secret that Ian Lowther, 47, had kept during years as an apparently model citizen. </p> <p>Lowther, a grandfather of four, stood with head bowed in Sheffield crown court as Judge Michael Mettyear described his \"wicked and brutal murder\" of Mary Gregson, 39, in August 1977. </p> <p>He admitted killing Gregson, whom he had never before met. Her husband and parents have died since the tragedy. </p> <p>Sentencing Lowther, Judge Mettyear said: \"Twenty-three years ago you robbed an innocent woman of her life. You robbed parents of a child, a husband of his wife and a child of his mother - all this loss and tragedy to satisfy a few moments' lust. </p> <p>\"Thank goodness for advances in DNA profiling, thank goodness for the determination of the police, and thank goodness that the arm of the law is long.\" </p> <p>A well known and popular figure in Saltaire, near Bradford, Gregson was ambushed on a towpath as she walked half a mile from her canalside cottage to Salt's mill, where she worked as a cleaner. Her battered body was found in the river Aire, which runs alongside the canal, and Lowther was one of the first of 8,500 people interviewed over the next two decades. </p> <p>Aged 24 at the time of the murder, he was working as a labourer on a building site by the canal but convinced detectives that he had been collecting his daughter from his mother-in-law, after shopping and drinking in a local pub. </p> <p>From then on he lived a withdrawn life. His nemesis came last year, when the latest development of DNA profiling revealed secrets in small, poor quality samples and was made available to police. </p> <p>A senior officer originally assigned to the inquiry as a sergeant, Detective Superintendent Brian Taylor, ordered tests on the minuscule semen mark on Gregson's clothes, which had been carefully stored. Although degraded, the cells produced an exact pattern, and hundreds of local men previously interviewed were asked to give mouth swabs. </p> <p>Lowther, who had just been divorced, was number 532 and agreed without fuss when police called in February at his home in Baildon, a mile from the murder scene. The DNA match was exact, the court heard, leaving a one in a billion chance that he was not the killer. </p> <p>He broke down and confessed to murdering Gregson, whose sister, Judith Sykes, expressed the family's relief at an emotional press conference. </p> <p>\"We have never come to terms with Mary's death, and this was made worse by the fact that we never knew who was responsible,\" she said. \"We now feel we can put all the demons to bed. </p> <p>\"Mary can be laid to rest knowing that her killer has been caught, and we can get on with our lives. But she will never be forgotten.\" </p> <p>Mr Taylor said: \"As a detective looking at other cases, the question, 'could this man have killed Mary?', sometimes cropped up. Now I won't have to ask that question any longer.\" </p>",
  "<p>A man walks into a bar... Why blondes are stupid... What a woman really means when she says... Has anybody seen my pen? No, I haven't gone all Virginia Woolf on you. This isn't my stream of consciousness, it's what you're likely to find in your email in-tray when you return to work after a two-week holiday. </p> <p>And your heart sinks as you scroll down 328 unread messages. Two hours later you're still working your way through them: inane jokes, inane responses to inane jokes, inane responses to the responses. </p> <p>Occasionally, you'll come across something of import: a date for a meeting, a message from a client, a reminder that you've got an appraisal next week. </p> <p>By the time you've stored and deleted where appropriate, it's lunchtime. Start work and every thought will be interrupted by that familiar ping, as another email drops into your in-tray. </p> <p>Steven Roberts, a freelance copywriter, is concerned by the impact email has had on office communication. \"Recently,\" he recalls, \"I was working in the offices of a large television company. Nobody spoke to each other - virtually all information was communicated by email. Several times, I announced to my boss that I'd finished a job, only to be told to repeat this information by email and then to await my next instructions by email too. And my boss was sitting right next to me!\" </p> <p>I'm old enough (just) to remember the days before email became a ubiquitous feature in the workplace. The days when people spoke to each other, arranged meetings using diaries and only asked the appropriate person if they had a query, not the entire company. </p> <p>I'm not a Luddite. I can navigate my way round the web, possess a fax and a mobile phone and, as I write this, digital television is being installed in my living room. But I can't be the only person who feels that email is taking over the office, at the cost of conversation and efficiency. </p> <p>According to the experts, I'm being alarmist. Psychologist Guy Fielding, a communications specialist at Oxford University, does not agree that email is replacing other forms of office communication. \"Most people mistakenly believe in the substitution model for how communication channels work,\" he says. \"We think that when a new form of communication comes along it eliminates the others - the telephone, for example, stops people travelling to see each other or writing letters. </p> <p>\"There's a lot of evidence that this isn't the case. In fact, people who use the telephone the most also travel the most - and every year the number of letters sent increases by 5% to 10%.\" </p> <p>Guy believes all channels of communication work as a network, feeding each other. For example, the person you're most likely to telephone is someone you already know face to face. And phonecalls are often made to set up face-to-face meetings. </p> <p>\"When you introduce a new communications medium like email, it has more of an impact on how the other channels are used, not on whether they're used,\" he states. \"People shift some of their activity out of the old channels but continue to use them, but only for the purpose best suited to them.\" </p> <p>The problem is that this process can take time. When a new medium is first introduced, people get a little over-excited about its potential, which leads to overuse - hence the flurry of email jokes, chain letters and inane messages wending their way around your office. </p> <p>Blame it on the innovators of the system, says Guy. \"Naturally, they claim it's the system to replace all other systems, but that's not true. In the first flush of enthusiasm people try to do everything using the new medium. </p> <p>\"After a while they learn it doesn't work. When they return to the old systems, their use is refined because they've added another channel of communication. Email is not destructive of other forms of communication. In fact, it probably has the opposite effect.\" </p> <p>Adam Joinson, a psychologist at the Open University, says that far from inhibiting or disrupting office communication, email has many benefits. \"It's a great tool for brainstorming, decision-making and getting diverse groups in organisations - such as marketing and accounts - to talk to each other. If someone puts you on the spot by asking a question, you may answer rashly. </p> <p>But using email gives you the time to craft a sensible, articulate response. It's also a great aid to memory: rather than reminding people one by one of a meeting organised weeks ago, you can send a single email.\" </p> <p>Adam believes that we tend to over-emphasise how great face-to-face communication is. \"When you listen to people talking face-to-face, most of it is not as coherent as you'd expect. In speech, a lot is implied. But in writing you have to focus on your message and spell it out.\" </p> <p>Adam has just completed a study comparing levels of self-disclosure in email and face-to-face communication. In the first part of the study, people using a computer chat programme were compared with a group talking face to face. Observers rated how many times they self-disclosed in the course of the conversation. The result? The people using email disclosed four times as much as those conversing face-to-face. </p> <p>The second part of the study compared email users with those using email and a video-conferencing camera. Again, those who couldn't see each other disclosed more. \"Being able to see each other actually reduces the amount of social communication,\" says Adam. \"When they can't see each other, people are more focused and less concerned about being judged. We spend a lot of time focusing on controlling our non-verbal communication - maintaining eye contact, the way we sit, the tone of our voice etc. When using email we can concentrate on the message, not the way we present it.\" </p> <p>Email is a great tool for breaking down boundaries. Disability, accent, ethnic origin, dress sense and attractiveness become irrelevant. Instead - and this is the downside - we are judged on the speed of our response and our way with words. </p> <p>Adam says workers need to be trained in email use. \"Research has shown that people who have problems with the amount of emails coming in don't know how to organise them into folders. People aren't properly trained in who to send messages to, or basic email etiquette - like not sending jokes or requests to everyone. Bosses should teach their staff to only check their emails a certain number of times per day so they're not constantly being interrupted.\" </p> <p>Many workplaces are cracking down on email use, by forbidding chain emails and personal messages. Adam says that it's important to maintain a balance, so that the social benefits of email aren't lost. \"If email use is too tightly controlled, it will stop brainstorming and the forming of communities.\"</p>",

  "It takes a giant leap of faith to link the words Croydon and glamour, yet 70 years ago film stars, millionaires and half the crowned heads of Europe swept through the world's first purpose-built international airport. <p>In Croydon's glory days, visitors took tea on the roof of the airport hotel to peer through binoculars at stars including Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks Jr and Mary Pickford; others paid sixpence to stand on top of a water tower, just to watch planes taking off and landing. </p> <p>Long after warehouses had covered the old runways, the listed terminal building and the control tower survived as a dismal landmark in an industrial estate in the south London suburb, recorded on the national register of important buildings at risk. Now Airport House has been restored as a business complex, and a small visitor centre has been created in the tower, which opens tomorrow. </p> <p>\"It's hard to believe it,\" concedes Adrienne Bloch, Croydon council's heritage officer, \"but this really was one of the most glamorous places in Britain, the gateway to the Empire.\" </p> <p>Croydon International opened in 1920 on an old RAF landing strip. KLM, the Dutch national airline, and Imperial, one of the predecessors of British Airways, were in from the start. </p> <p>Early planes had a pilot in an open cockpit, and a dozen passengers in Lloyd Loom chairs bolted to the floor beside windows - which they could open if it got stuffy. </p> <p>Within 10 years there were scheduled flights to Europe, Africa, India and Australia, a journey which took almost a fortnight with overnight stops in hotels and dozens of refuelling stops. Huge crowds came to Croydon to greet Charles Lindbergh who flew in from Paris after he had crossed the Atlantic, and the pioneer long distance aviator Amy Johnson. </p> <p>In the 1930s the airlines were still sending advice to nervous passengers who had never seen a plane before. \"It is not necessary to have a wardrobe specially made for flying,\" they said comfortingly, while warning gentlemen that some hotels en route would allow lounge suits for dinner, but shorts would never be acceptable. </p> <p>In the second world war Croydon became an RAF base again, and a target for German bombers: one air traffic controller's diary records, in wavering pencil, an injury to his leg in the first daylight raid in 1940. \"Felt rather shaky,\" he writes, before adding that he was allowed go home early, but was shamefully three hours late for work next morning. </p> <p>After the war Heathrow and Gatwick were on the rise, while Croydon was too small to take the big new planes.

  "The president of Croatia, Stipe Mesic, yesterday sacked seven army generals for complaining that the government was insulting the memory of the country's war for independence by prosecuting alleged war criminals for atrocities committed against Serbs. <p>Mr Mesic's tough move was a sign of how far things have moved since the death of President Franjo Tudjman and the election of a liberal government which wants to restore links with the rest of Europe. </p> <p>As well as being a rare case of a country willing to try its former military elite - not just for corruption but for war crimes - Croatia's trials could be a precursor to similar action in Serbia, if the opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, succeeds in removing Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, from power. </p> <p>Although he has criticised the international criminal tribunal in the Hague for being an instrument of US interests, Mr Kostunica has left open the option of starting war crimes trials or a state-sponsored \"truth commission\" in Serbia. </p> <p>He says Serbia must confront its role in the last decade of Yugoslavia's civil wars. </p> <p>The seven Croatian generals who were sacked yesterday - Ante Gotovina, Kresimir Cosic, Damir Krsticevic, Ivan Kapular, Milenko Filipovic, Davor Domazet-Lose and Mirko Norac - were among 12 active and retired generals who made their allegations in an open letter published on Thursday. They were strong supporters of Tudjman's nationalist government. </p> <p>In the letter they noted \"with bitterness\" that the 1991 war against Yugoslavia has been presented \"as a crime and something filthy, while in fact it was the foundation of Croatia's freedom, independence and sovereignty\". </p> <p>They accused Mr Mesic and the government of \"waging a campaign to smear the independence struggle through recent spectacular arrests\". </p> <p>The generals were referring to the new government's decision to hold trials as well as to cooperate with the war-crimes tribunal in the Hague, even if the perpetrators were Croats. </p> <p>Investigators from the tribunal began looking for the graves of an estimated 120 Serbs in Gospic, central Croatia, earlier this year. </p> <p>In forcing them into retirement, Mr Mesic cited a constitutional ban against senior military officials publicly airing political views. \"My message to those who think they can bring down the government with pamphlets is that they are playing the wrong hand,\" he said, adding that the army must be \"depoliticised\". </p> <p>\"Whoever wants to be involved in politics has the right to do so; I won't suggest which party they should join. But while they are in the army they will not be publishing pamphlets,\" Mr Mesic said. </p> <p>The generals' protest follows the arrest earlier this month of four Croats suspected of killing Serb civilians in Gospic in 1991. Police also arrested several soldiers accused of slaughtering civilians in neighbouring Bosnia. </p> <p>Angry war veterans have been demonstrating against the arrests in Gospic on a daily basis for several weeks. </p> <p>In September, Milan Levar, a key witness, was killed by a bomb outside his home in Gospic. He had helped to defend the town in 1991 when local Serbs rebelled against Croatia's declaration of independence. But he was so shocked by his own side's actions that he decided to give evidence to the war-crimes tribunal in the Hague. </p> <p>Reporters in Gospic were threatened by the crowd during an arrest there two weeks ago. A radio reporter in Zagreb was also accosted by a man who put a pistol into his mouth, threatening to kill him. </p> <p>Ironically, despite Croatia's willingness to work with the Hague tribunal as well as to conduct its own trials, there is some resentment in Zagreb about the west's rush to lift sanctions on Yugoslavia and forget the war-crimes issue once Mr Milosevic leaves power. \"I don't think sanctions should be lifted until Yugoslavia does what we did: adopt a law on cooperation with the Hague tribunal and extradite its war-crimes suspects,\" Mr Mesic said this week.</p>",

  "Dripping with sweat in the afternoon sun, farmer Shimon Sebban wills on the workers slashing their way through his vineyard, until the dry earth is hidden beneath mounds of green branches. \"I am going to have to stand on their heads to finish on time,\" he says. <p>Pruning is a task normally reserved for the lazy days of winter, but this year's growing season is turned topsy-turvy by an inconvenient passage from the Bible. From sunset yesterday, for one full year of the Jewish calendar, Mr Sebban is forbidden to plant, hoe, or prune. </p> <p>The injunction is irritating even for traditionalists, like Mr Sebban's cousin and fellow farmer, Eli Sella. \"This goes against the laws of nature,\" Mr Sella complains. \"We are still picking the red grapes. How can we prune, while we are picking?\" </p> <p>The farmers can - indeed must - because of Leviticus 25: 3-4: \"Six years thou shalt sow thy field. But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the lord. Thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard.\" </p> <p>This year, 5761 on the Jewish calendar, happens to be a seventh year, the shmita, or letting go. So even before he saw to his grapes, Mr Sella took care of his artichokes, planting them weeks earlier than usual to escape the ban. </p> <p>Observing shmita is not usually a problem because Israelis are expert at ruses to reconcile Jewish religious dictats with modern practicalities. Some observances of the fallow year have withered and died - like remission of debt. Others, such as \"selling\" land to non-Jews, are practised by sleight of hand. </p> <p>But this is a season of tensions, with orthodox Jews buffeted by the \"secular revolution\" promised by the prime minister, Ehud Barak, and efforts by the ultra-orthodox to usurp their control of the rabbinate. Meanwhile, Sephardi Jews, or those from Arabic-speaking countries, are chafing at the dominance of the European establishment. </p> <p>All these rivalries converged when some rabbis set out to prove they were holier than their brothers by striking down the cosy compact of imaginary land sales. They decreed that they would cancel the kosher certificates of supermarkets and grocers stocking local vegetables during the shmita - measures that could send food prices reeling. </p> <p>Mr Sella and Mr Sebban view the wrangling with growing alarm. For the cousins, the merest suggestion that their grapes and artichokes are non-kosher could spell economic ruin. Supermarket chains would shun them for fear of alienating Jews who keep the dietary laws - perhaps half of all Israelis. Their grapes and artichokes would be welcome in only a few secular strongholds. </p> <p>Although 80% of the grapes grown at Beit Uziel are sold to Marks &amp; Spencer, Mr Sella is unwilling to risk the stigma. </p> <p>\"I was looking at bankruptcy,\" says Mr Sella, who is 700,000 shekels (\u00a3120,000) in debt. Like all farmers, he has been hit hard by the decline of what was once Israel's primary industry. Agriculture now accounts for only 3% of GNP. </p> <p>So he and the other 65 families in this farming community in central Israel have consulted their rabbi to devise a solution. Instead of an imaginary land sale, they have sold their entire grape crop in advance to the Israeli rabbinate. </p> <p>That will assure the farmers of a buyer when the harvest rolls around next March - although the rabbinate did not fix a price and, according to Mr Sella, proved a hard bargainer. \"They squeezed every last bit of life out of me before they gave me an advance.\" </p> <p>But what is good for grapes is not good for artichokes. For that crop, Mr Sella has obtained the usual kosher certificate for a shmita year, even though it is no longer recognised by some rabbis. </p> <p>\"The ultra-orthodox will not be eating my artichokes,\" he says. \"But I will manage.\"</p>",
  "The most hallowed ground in the holy city - and the volatile core of the Israeli-Arab conflict - was doused in blood yesterday as rioting between Muslim worshippers and Israeli police left four Palestinians dead, and as many as 200 wounded. <p>The violence erupted at the close of afternoon prayers when Israeli riot police stormed the Haram al-Sharif, the site of the Dome of the Rock that is the third-holiest shrine in Islam, firing live rounds and rubber bullets at stone-throwing Palestinian youths. </p> <p>Dozens of police, including the Jerusalem police chief, were hit by stones after the violence was stoked by the arrival of more than 22,000 people for prayer. </p> <p>With peace negotiations locked for weeks over the fate of the Haram - which Jews claim as the site of their destroyed temple - and Israel mourning a border policeman who was killed by a member of the Palestinian security forces earlier yesterday, the clashes could escalate out of control; violence also broke out in several areas of the West Bank. </p> <p>It was the second consecutive day of rioting on the Haram, following the provocative visit there on Thursday by the leader of the hardline Likud party, Ariel Sharon, in a blatant display of Israel's iron grip on the heart of Muslim Jerusalem. </p> <p>By the time the muezzin called the faithful to prayer yesterday, tempers were menacingly high, with Palestinians bridling at the large Israeli presence on their hallowed ground. \"It is forbidden for them to come inside with their sticks. This makes our young men explode,\" said Sami Bibi, who lives in east Jerusalem, occupied illegally by Israel since 1967. \"When I was praying they were hanging over my head.\" </p> <p>The Israelis say scuffles broke out when Palestinians began raining stones on the heads of Jewish worshippers at the Wailing Wall, below the Haram. They soon turned ugly. </p> <p>\"If you went toward the gate they would shoot at you. People were just trying to get out and they shut the gate,\" said Israr Hussain, a tourist from Halifax. </p> <p>\"As soon as the prayers finished, they started firing,\" said Abu Assab Khader, whose right calf was pierced by a rubber-coated bullet. \"They shot at us like dogs - no, flies.\" </p> <p>There were reports that the Israelis used live ammunition. </p> <p>\"I saw two or three people with their brains outside their head,\" said a doctor at the nearby Muqassad hospital, who would not give his name. \"That was not [caused by] rubber bullets.\" </p> <p>The Israeli version of events was different, with a government spokesman, Moshe Fogel, blaming Muslim clerics for setting events in motion with incendiary prayers. </p> <p>As the day wore on, the rioting spread to other neighbourhoods of Arab east Jerusalem, and outlying villages, where five tourists were hurt when their bus was stoned. Street violence also rocked Palestinian-ruled areas, with clashes reported in the West Bank towns of Bethlehem and Ramallah, and in Gaza. Crowds of Palestinians, some clutching iron bars, took to the roads, setting fire to Israeli cars. </p> <p>Palestinian radio called the two days of clashes on the Haram the start of \"the battle for Jerusalem\". </p> <p>Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, said they were \"extremely serious\". \"I spoke to [Palestinian leader Yasser] Arafat today and I made it clear to him that attacks such as this are totally unacceptable and that we expect the Palestinian authority to do everything in its power, using all the means at its disposal, against perpetrators of terrorist acts,\" he said.</p>",
  "Pierre Trudeau, who has died of prostate cancer aged 80, was Canada's most intellectual and flamboyant prime minister. His disdain for Quebec nationalism, belief in a bilingual, multicultural federation and commitment to the constitutional entrenchment of civic rights and freedoms were the hallmarks of his 17 years in government. <p>Elected to the Canadian parliament in 1965, he rose meteorically to the leadership of the Liberal party in 1968. He won three successive general elections, lost to the Conservatives in 1979, then led the Liberals back to power in 1980. In his final government, he secured a clear No vote in Quebec's first referendum on sovereignty-association, and entrenched Canada's constitution with a charter of rights and freedoms. </p> <p>Trudeau was born in Montreal in 1919 - a date confirmed only after he won the Liberal leadership, claiming to be a year younger than he was. His mother had Scottish and French-Canadian roots. His father was pur laine Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, an ambitious Montreal lawyer from a long line of unilingual peasant-farmers. Though his early death traumatised Pierre, his shrewd business deals secured the family a $1m fortune. </p> <p>By all accounts, Trudeau was a competitive young man, encouraged by his father to achieve athletic prowess and educated with disciplined intensity at Br\u00e9buf, the Jesuit college for Quebec's francophone elite. Physically and intellectually agile, he had a need to win or have the final word. </p> <p>After completing law school in 1943 - while campaigning against conscription - and articling for a year in Montreal, he took courses in political economy at Harvard, the Sorbonne and the London School of Economics, where he mastered ideas of constitutional liberalism, Parisian personalism and British Fabianism, before heading home via a year-long journey through the Middle East and Asia. </p> <p>Back in Quebec in 1949, Trudeau was shocked to find Quebec gripped by the regressive, Catholic nationalism that underscored Maurice Duplessis's corrupt Union Nationale govern- ment. Gerard Pelletier, a journalist he befriended in Paris, invited him to witness an asbestos workers' strike, an event that reinforced Trudeau's determination to oppose Duplessis and brought him and Pelletier into contact with the union leader, Jean Marchand, for the first time. </p> <p>Like many Quebec intellectuals who loathed Duplessis, Trudeau escaped to Ottawa and a junior job in the Privy Council Office preparing background material for constitutional conferences. He found the federal capital dull, and its bureaucracy patronising to French-Canadians, so returned to Quebec in 1951, worked as a civil liberties lawyer for the labour movement and edited a collection, The Asbestos Strike, challenging Duplessis. Consequently blocked from an academic law position at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, he co-founded Cit\u00e9 Libre, a journal that called for reason over nationalist passion. Federalism, by virtue of bringing diverse ethnic groups into a single state, he argued, would allow Frenchness to thrive in Canada. </p> <p>Duplessis died in 1959 and Quebec underwent a quiet revolution. The provincial Liberals won the 1960 election and created a welfare state to replace the Catholic church in healthcare and education. While most Quebec intellectuals welcomed this period, Trudeau used the university post he quickly acquired to attack the secular neo-nationalism of the Quebec state and the separatist movement it spawned. On November 5 1965, he stood with Marchand and Pelletier in the federal election, determined to address the French-Canadian question from Ottawa. </p> <p>Had the Quebec wing of the Liberal party been stronger, and Prime Minister Lester Pearson not been facing nationalist militancy in the province, the three men might have had fewer opportunities to influence the debate. As it was, in December 1965, Marchand persuaded Pearson to make Trudeau his parliamentary secretary, a job that gave him status within the Quebec caucus, access to the centres of government power and the international experience of travelling through the Francophonie to build support against Quebec separatism. In April 1967, Trudeau entered Pearson's cabinet as justice minister. </p> <p>It was the centennial summer, when President de Gaulle, touring Canada, called for \"Le Qu\u00e9bec Libre\". But the erudite bachelor Trudeau, who rode a Harley-Davidson and wore sandals in the legislature, worked through it, doggedly revising the criminal code. He modernised laws on divorce, homosexuality and abortion, arguing that \"the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation\". </p> <p>Precisely what went on in Trudeau's own bedroom was always a subject of speculation. His extended bachelorhood and homosexual law reform encouraged rumours. But it was his liaisons with women that inverted his mantra of \"reason over passion\". There was nightclubbing at Commonwealth conferences, an affair with Barbra Streisand, and his secret marriage in 1971 to Margaret Sinclair, a beautiful, west coast flower child of a former cabinet minister. Some 30 years his junior, she bore him three children, helped win the 1974 election and then rebelled with doped-out indiscretions. </p> <p>Trudeaumania took root in February 1968, when he announced his candidacy for the Liberal leadership, soon after a televised showdown with Quebec's premier. He was the only French-Canadian running to head a party that alternates between francophone and anglophone leaders. His charisma and ability to reason clearly in both languages appealed at a time when Quebec tensions were, quite literally, exploding in mail-boxes around Montreal. Canadians adored this sexy genius, who wanted to create a \"just society\". </p> <p>On April 6 1968, after four ballots and seven-and-a-half hours of voting, Trudeau set out to rebuild Canada in his own image... \"this beautiful, rich and energetic country of ours can become a model in which every citizen will enjoy his fundamental rights, in which two great linguistic communities and people of many cultures will live in harmony and in which every individual will find fulfilment.\" Three weeks later, sworn in as Canada's 15th prime minister, he called a general election and, on June 25 1968, the day after nationalist demonstrators stoned him in Montreal, he secured the first federal Liberal majority since 1953. </p> <p>Trudeau set Canada on as independent a foreign policy course as possible in north America, opening diplomatic relations with China and reducing Canada's commitment to Nato. But his primary concerns were to counter Quebec nationalism, build national unity, overhaul government and ensure Canada's constitutional decolonisation. </p> <p>The 1969 Official Languages Act was his key response to state-centred nationalism in Quebec. It institutionalised bilingualism, created a federal bureaucracy that employs French-Canadians at every level, and delivers services in French and English. The strategy aimed to attract bright young francophones to work in Ottawa, not Quebec, and ensure that the provincial francophone majority, and the francophone minorities elsewhere, identified with the federal state. </p> <p> Like so many of Trudeau's ideas, it was brilliant in principle but problematic in practice. It granted individual rights and new employment opportunities to French-Canadians, reduced the domination of anglophone mandarins in Ottawa, but failed to counter Quebec nationalism's mystical appeal or anticipate the backlash. Although Trudeau tried to enhance national unity with a department of regional and economic expansion, he never undercut the resentment that citizens west of Winnipeg felt about his obsession with Quebec. Trudeau restructured the cabinet committee system, expanded the prime minister's office, and engaged the Liberal party in a massive, exercise of policy innovation, establishing task forces on everything. Though designed to build policy on liberal principles and encourage participation in his \"just society\", these measures frustrated the party faithful, who were used to brokerage politics, and irritated the electorate when policymaking took too damn long. </p> <p>Trudeau's rationality was fundamentally challenged on October 5 1970, when the terrorist Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) kidnapped James Cross, the British trade commisioner in Montreal. Five days later, the FLQ abducted (and later murdered) the Quebec labour minister, Pierre Laporte. Urged on by Quebec's liberal premier, Robert Bourassa, Trudeau took the drastic step of invoking the War Measures Act in peacetime. </p> <p>His popularity soared, but the promoter of civil liberties had put the military on the streets, suspended habeas corpus and legitimised massive arrests of FLQ suspects. Civil libertarians and Quebec nationalists never forgave him. </p> <p>When Trudeau called a general election in 1972 - with the slogan \"The Land is Strong\" - his campaign strategy proved weak. The love-in was over, and unemployment had soared. In his drive to bilingualise Canada, calm insurrection in Quebec, and overhaul Ottawa, he had forgotten to oil the party machine, failed to curb inflation and dismissed the bilingual backlash as bigotry. The Liberals scraped back to power with 109 seats, against the Tories' 107, and Trudeau formed a minority government with support from the New Democratic party (NDP). </p> <p>Trudeau, the pragmatist, now surrounded himself with professional party men. His speeches became emotional, his contacts with the party faithful more personal, and policy implementation was faster as deals were forged with the NDP. Pensions and family allowances increased, and the Foreign Investment Review Agency was created to boost economic sovereignty. After two years, he went back to the electorate with Margaret at his side, and the Liberals secured a majority third term. </p> <p>Although Trudeau and his cabinet reverted to protracted planning exercises, creating a new tax structure to redistribute resources from richer to poorer provinces, he ensured Canada's entry to the G7 group and initiated trade contracts with the EEC, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific rim. Petro-Canada was created to placate westerners and, in 1978, the Canadian Human Rights Commission was established to root out discrimination. But inflation and unemployment spiralled as the Liberals found themselves unable to cope with the impact of the 1973 oil crisis. </p> <p>In October 1976, they reversed their election promise, established the Anti-Inflation Board and imposed wage and price controls. To cap it all, in November 1976, Trudeau's old rival, Ren\u00e9 L\u00e8vesque, led the nationalist Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) to victory in the provincial election, determined to seek a new sovereign-association between Quebec and Canada. PQ's victory re-energised Trudeau's fight against nationalism, but by now Margaret was against him. She spent their sixth wedding anniversary at a Rolling Stones concert, and told People magazine that her nipple outlines excited state visitors. Two months later, the couple separated. </p> <p>In May 1979, the Liberals' inability to boost the Canadian economy brought Joe Clark's Conservatives to minority government. Trudeau was shattered and, in November, he announced his retirement. </p> <p>But it was not the end. Three weeks later, the Conservative government was defeated. Trudeau stayed on, and, in February 1980, won another majority government. In that final term, there was the second oil crisis, an intensification of energy battles with western Canada and new tensions in the US-Canadian relationship after Ronald Reagan won the presidency. But the May 1980 Quebec referendum produced a clear 60-40 victory for the federalists, and a historic battle between Levesque and Trudeau. </p> <p>For Levesque it was horrendous. If the Conservatives had stayed in power, his social-democratic government would have had an easier time promoting sovereignty-association. But Trudeau's icy logic exposed sovereignty association as a weak compromise that would ensure Quebec's eventual secession. Days before the plebiscite, he promised Quebeckers that if they voted No he would renew the constitution. </p> <p>He did just that. On May 21 1980, he set about getting the constitution patriated from Britain. Over lunch at Downing Street, he informed Mrs Thatcher that the Canadian constitution was coming home - although neither she, nor her advisers, had enough understanding of Canadian constitutional politics to anticipate what followed. </p> <p>In October 1980, having failed yet again to get the provincial premiers to agree on a constitutional amendment formula, Trudeau announced that he was taking unilateral action on a \"people's package\" to patriate the constitution and entrench it with a charter of rights. He was challenged by three provinces in the Canadian supreme court, who all used provincial diplomats in London to lobby British backbenchers. </p> <p>In September 1981, the supreme court decided that although Trudeau's initiative was constitutionally legitimate, it betrayed conventions which held that the majority of premiers should agree to constitutional amendments. On November 5 1981, 16 years to the day that Trudeau was first elected to parliament, the federal government and nine provinces came to a patriation deal that Quebec would not sign. </p> <p>Aboriginal leaders were livid, claiming that their contract with the Crown had been negated. But the process for patriating Canada's constitution, complete with a charter of rights and a clause allowing governments to opt out of certain sections for five years at a time, went ahead in Westminster. On April 17 1982, in pouring rain, the Queen and Trudeau signed the proclamation of a new Canadian constitution and the Quebec government was bound by a charter it loathed. </p> <p>In many senses, Trudeau had won his battle against Quebec nationalism. He had overseen the creation of a charter that will have a lasting impact on Canadian jurisprudence, but he had not managed to create the pan-Canadian nation-building instrument that would fully clarify the relationship between all Canadians and the federal state. </p> <p> Two years later, he left office and found a perch in a Montreal law firm. He raised his sons, produced a self-justifying memoire, canoed his heart out and fathered a daughter by the constitutional lawyer, Deborah Coyne. He read lots, wrote less and travelled more. </p> <p>He re-emerged in full force in 1987 and 1991 to speak out against new constitutional proposals to recognise Quebec as a distinct society, a stance that won him some respect in western Canada, but rekindled nationalist loathing in Quebec. Indeed, in October 1995, when Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien staged a desperate, mass-Canadian rally in Montreal to save Canada from its closest call ever in the second Quebec referendum, Trudeau, the man who had championed federalism all his life, was asked to stay away. </p> <p>He kept custody of his three sons Justin, Sacha, and Michel after his separation and later divorce. Michel died in a skiing accident in 1998. His other two sons and daughter survive him. </p> <p> <b> Annis May Timpson</b> </p> <p> Joseph Phillippe Pierre Yves Elliot Trudeau, politician, born October 18 1919; died September 28 2000</p>",
  "<p>Last Saturday afternoon, I was picking my way down the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, taking in the view of the city wall and the Dome of the Rock, when one of my companions pointed out that in the Jewish cemetery to our left lay the body of Robert Maxwell. I had forgotten that Maxwell had been buried there after his mysterious death almost nine years ago, after which Israel had given him a sendoff worthy of a king, with a lying-in-state at which the then president, Chaim Herzog, noted Maxwell's \"significant involvement\" in the country's struggle \"for economic independence, for the absorption of the Russian immigration, for the security of our country, and for the achievement of peace\". </p> <p>At the funeral itself, where the vast corpse of this preposterous man lay wrapped in a prayer shawl, the eulogies continued: the then leader of the Israeli Labour Party, Shimon Peres, said, \"In those waters he lost his breath but not his soul. It will float above the waves as a marker to anyone believing that a man can be bigger than the cards he was dealt.\" The enormity of Maxwell's financial wrongdoing had not then been exposed, but even now there is little embarrassment in Israel about its unqualified admiration of him. His enduring status as a Jewish hero is symptomatic of the Israeli tendency to regard selflessness in service to the Jewish state (a quality that Maxwell undoubtedly had) as a virtue compelling forgiveness of most other sins. </p> <p>At the Anglo-Israel Colloquium on The Role of the Media in the Information Age, an event for which I had been invited to Israel, there were gasps among the British participants when Tommy Lapid, a member of the Knesset and a celebrated television pundit, said that when he had been editor of the daily newspaper, Ma'ariv, under Maxwell's ownership, he had suffered no proprietorial interference. If true, this is further evidence of Maxwell's application of different standards towards Britain and Israel - his treatment of the Mirror was not so much interference as rape. </p> <p>The Anglo-Israel Association, which organised the colloquium, is a fairly new institution, but it deserves a bright future. Last weekend's event brought together an impressive collection of media and political big shots from both countries under the amiable joint chairmanship of John Tusa, the former BBC broadcaster who now runs the Barbican Centre in London, and Lord Samuel, grandson of the first British High Commissioner in Palestine after the first world war and professor emeritus of chemistry at the Weizmann Institute of Science. (He also studied chemistry with Margaret Thatcher at Oxford, where he found her very mousy and lacking in confidence.) </p> <p>One could say, I suppose, that the Israeli delegates were not wholly representative of their country, for many of them were of British birth and education, while many British delegates were Jewish. But this ensured far more conviviality and mutual understanding than is normal at such international conferences, for the participants already had so much in common. Come to think of it, Israel could (or perhaps does) emulate this arrangement with lots of other countries - Israeli Americans talking to Americans, Israeli Russians talking to Russians, Israeli Ethiopians talking to Ethiopians, even Israeli Arabs talking to Arabs. This is one advantage of being such a fractured society. </p> <p> As it turned out, the British participants included the two official British representatives at Maxwell's funeral - the then British ambassador to Israel, Mark Elliott, and Gerald Kaufman MP, shadow foreign secretary at the time - both of whom appeared to wish that they hadn't been burdened with this particular duty. Kaufman's relationship with Israel is interesting, since he has been so outraged by the encirclement of the golden city with dull Jewish housing estates that he refused to go there for several years. As chairman of the Commons' select committee on the media, his relationship with the British press is also interesting - in one intervention, he said he could no longer see what British newspapers were for: they achieved nothing, changed no opinions, and affected no policies. This assessment was disputed. </p> <p>The main theme of the colloquium, however, was the internet and how it has changed the whole media scene. If the meeting reached any conclusions, they were that the only guaranteed safeguard of press freedom is a plurality of ownership (one business group is now poised to assume control of 70% of Israel's media), that public service broadcasting must survive, and that the industry's regulators will have to become more respected and democratically accountable. </p> <p>As for Israel itself, my impression is that the country is so much more confident than it used to be that it will be less ready in the future to overlook the crimes of friends such as Robert Maxwell.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Deceive not thy physician, confessor, or lawyer - </strong> George Herbert </p> <p>Jeffrey Archer can be thankful that he has not been indicted for perjury in the state of Indiana. The law there says that it is not enough to be truthful when testifying in court, you have to be logical too; for you commit perjury not only if you make a statement under oath which, as the statute has it, you either know to be false or which you do not believe to be true - a nice distinction - but also if you make two or more statements which are inconsistent with each other to such an extent that at least one of them has to be false. Since almost all of us hold inconsistent beliefs, we would do well to say as little as possible if we find ourselves in an Indiana witness stand. </p> <p>The actual wording of Indiana's perjury statute is that statements have to be \"inconsistent to the degree that one of them is necessarily false,\" which in enjoining logic on the populace by law, is itself illogical - not in the sense that it is illogical to wish people to be logical, however hopeless an ambition that may be, but rather in the sense that the statute itself, on a literal reading, is illogical. And even on a generous reading it requires far too much. </p> <p>The problem is loose wording, a fault that drafters of legal instruments are usually keen to avoid. The statute should require that statements are inconsistent to the degree that they cannot be true together, but it cannot require that whichever of them is false should be a \"necessary falsehood.\" In the strict technical sense of logic, a statement is necessarily false when it cannot possibly be true - when, in short, it is self-contradictory. But both members of an inconsistent pair of statements can be self-consistent, in the sense that their respective truth and falsity could have been the other way round if the world had been different. </p> <p>This is what distinguishes a commonplace falsehood from a necessary one; the latter cannot be true under any circumstances. The mere fact that one statement is inconsistent with another is no guarantee that either of them is necessarily false in this sense. And it is too lenient on perjurers to indict them for contradictions only. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the intention of the Indiana statute is clear, and it captures the aim of perjury laws everywhere. Perjury is a serious crime because it directly undermines the purpose of proceedings at law, which is to do justice. Justice cannot be done unless the parties to a case provide the court with statements they sincerely believe to be true, and which convey all the relevant information in their possession. Since the very possibility of justice depends on this, all jurisdictions are severe in their punishment of perjury when they detect it. </p> <p>Naturally enough perjury is committed all the time, usually because someone wishes to save his skin, but occasionally in hopes of serving a greater good. But even the latter is rarely a good excuse for it. The reason that lying in court is called perjury rather than simply lying, is that it is lying on oath. A party to a proceedings swears to the court, either on the Bible or by affirmation, to tell the truth. Taking an oath is no light matter; it is an undertaking to play a responsible part in the serious business of getting jus tice done. Membership of society carries with it a tacit commitment to play a responsible part in general, but the deliberate and public avowal of that pledge in court is a special act, and perjury is the perversion of it. </p> <p>Optimistically, the law assumes that there is such a thing as truth, and that any individual can tell all of it, not only with no trace of falsehood tainting it, but without any admixture of mere probability or surmise. But the delicate question of whether truth exists, or is attainable, is in this sphere not the point. The absolute language of the oath has a pragmatic purpose: which is to impress on witnesses that they must strive not to mislead the court, because if they succeed in doing so they murder justice. </p> <p>This is why it does not matter whether the subject of a perjury is trivial or crucial. The mere fact of perjury is, by itself, matter crucial enough; for justice is one of the highest yet one of the most fragile of values, and its enemies cannot be given quarter. </p>",
  "<p>Karl Wallinger could have been a contender. A critical part of the Waterboys line-up that gave us A Pagan Place and This is the Sea, he left to pursue his own ambitions of 1960s-tinged, environmentalist pop. </p> <p>World Party's first three albums - 1987's Private Revolution, 1991's Goodbye Jumbo and 1993's chart-busting Bang - effectively defined those times: retro but modern-sounding anthems, and dire warnings about the world's future. Around this time, though, something awful seemed to happen to Wallinger's muse. Possibly finding the world's present wasn't too great either, he retreated further into his childhood loves - the Beatles, Dylan and the Stones - aping them to the point where he became less a rock'n'roll star than an impressionist. Still, even his most facsimile album, 1997's Egyptology, produced She's the One, which gave Robbie Williams an inter- national hit. </p> <p>The main guests have long since left the Party, notably Guy Chambers (now Williams's co-songwriter) and drummer Chris Sharrocks, to Robbie's band. And Wallinger? Well, he's still here, a little greyer at the temples and struggling with his mic stand. It has been a long time. </p> <p>Three songs in, Wallinger bashes out the chords to the Fab Four's Dear Prudence - and launches into Another 1000 Years, the most Beatles-like track of his new album, Dumbing Up. However, what seems like a signal of sad museum pieces to come is, in fact, a solitary low point. </p> <p>In their heyday, World Party were always clinical onstage. But now, backed by a fearsome band, including a drummer who I'm sure spontaneously combusted in Spinal Tap, Wallinger is both raw and relaxed, japing with the crowd and sending himself up. But when it matters - in the songs - he delivers. Dumbing Up's You're a Caravan, with its wry \"You're the future, I'm way back\" confessions, is spectacularly spooky. His rendition of She's the One is so unwaveringly emotional that if Williams heard it, he'd probably retire. </p> <p>Wallinger doesn't need to do this, and maybe that's why he's back - in control, on an independent label, on fire. \"I do it because I love it,\" he cries. \"Michelangelo did his last painting for nothing. More people should do that. It would fuck everybody up.\" </p> <p>Everybody cheers before joining in the \"whoo-whoos\" of the closing rocker Way Down Now for a good 10 minutes. The campaign for Wallinger's re-elevation to pop's premiership starts here.</p>",
  "<p> The essential precondition for a tiff is to be tired. Combine this with a low blood-sugar level, and just about anything you say or do will set off a tiff. When you're tired and hungry, you're usually both in the kitchen desperately trying to get something to eat. A little instruction such as 'Don't use that knife' said in the wrong tone can result in the knife in question sticking out of your back within seconds. If you do have a tiff in the kitchen, it's vital not to be the one who storms off to the bedroom, because you will starve while your partner eats a good meal, feels better and then sits in front of the television wondering where the hell you've got to. </p> <p>Tiffs spring up from nowhere over issues of astonishing triviality, for example, the way you hang up your bath towel. You then have to be very careful that there's not a thermonuclear escalation into deeply wounding psychological assault, where things are said about weight, dress, haircut or mother-in-law. Tiffs blow over quickly, but the punishment for your remarks will be severe and will last a very long time. </p> <p>Making up after tiffs is tricky, as someone eventually has to say sorry. With stubborn people, this sometimes never happens, and that's the last time you see them and their children and their children's children ever. Normally, about three minutes after you've said all the hurtful things and an uneasy silence has descended, one person will say, 'Look, Darren, I'm sorry' (it doesn't have to be Darren, obviously). Then Darren says, 'No, I'm sorry.' That's not the cue for you to say, 'I should bloody well think so!' Instead, you have to laugh, hug and (if you want corking sex afterwards) cry. </p> <p>The best excuse after a tiff is always to say that you were just very, very tired. Sadly, you can never use this excuse before a tiff, as saying, 'I'm too tired to argue' has the same function as a starting pistol for most domestic arguments. </p> <p>Lovers' tiffs are very amusing in that new lovers expect their little universe to be 100% perfect. Therefore, if you omit to kiss every single individual toe in turn, this is tantamount to a slap in the face and fully tiffworthy. At the other extreme, couples who are married with children have heavily disguised tiffs. A man saying in a slightly strained way, 'I'm going to turn the compost', is actually saying, 'And that's all you are, Jean, compost!' Of course, what happens is eventually he apologises, they cry, make love, have another child, get overtired and the tiffing continues.</p>",

  "Saffron and cardamom are two of the great exotics, sought after by princes, potentates, panjandrums and, of course, chefs. Made from the hand-picked stigmas of the purple Crocus sativus, saffron has, not surprisingly, always been of fabulous reputation, equalled only by its price. Cardamom is no less distinguished, however, its various forms being celebrated in the Mahabharata, lusted after by the Romans and celebrated in Chinese poetry. <p>Although neither originated there, both spices come together in the cooking of southern India, where they are used sparingly. Both have powerful flavouring qualities, which, if used in excess, bring out unpleasant, bullying and, in saffron's case, markedly bitter tones. Separately, they have marched through the culinary cultures around the world. </p> <p>The British have had a particular affinity for saffron, perhaps because the crocus actually grew in our climate. The curiously named Saffron Hill in the City of London is so called because it was once part of the gardens of Ely Palace, where saffron was grown, presumably for abstemious bishops. And the arms of Saffron Walden, Essex, bear three saffron flowers, a mark of when it was the centre of saffron production, its heyday being Tudor times. It found its way into a host of dishes, as well as buns and cakes, which is a splendid Cornish tradition that is still very much alive today. In retrospect, however, it seems rather odd that it was never used to bring colour and pizzazz to a stew of the fish that are native to our waters, in much the same way that countries around the Mediterranean have done. </p> <p>As with all spices, you have to treat saffron with respect. I have already noted its bullying tendencies if used with a heavy hand (although they are no worse than the herbs rosemary and sage), which may go some way to explaining why saffron has not always had the best press in these matters. The great herbalist, Nicholas Culpeper, noted that it was a \"useful aromatic, of a strong pungent bitterish taste\", while the French gastronome and writer, Alexandre Dumas, described it as near fatal. However, when it comes to adding the drama of colour to a dish, few spices can match saffron, and its distinctive flavour adds a curious and pleasing note. </p> <p>Because of the laborious nature of its production (and the consequent great cost), there is probably more fake saffron about than any other spice. You can find good quality saffron from Kashmir and Turkey, although the best comes from La Mancha in Spain. Remember that heat and, in particular, light are the enemies of all spices, so buy it only in small quantities (you probably won't be able to afford to do anything else, anyway) when you need it. </p> <p>Cardamom similarly loses its vitality when kept for too long. Pliny was spot on when he said that the green pods are the best, but if you're really picky check that the seeds inside are still sticky - if not, those heady aromas to which the Arab world (and, oddly, Sweden and Finland) is so addicted as a flavouring for coffee will be mere shadows. Likewise, ground cardamom. If you are a serious connoisseur, you will insist on your cardamom being the pale green Alleppey cardamom of Kerala, although it is grown all over southern India, Sri Lanka and Indochina, as well as Tanzania, Guatemala, El Salvador and New Guinea. </p> <p>Cardamom, like saffron, has a complicated history. There was some confusion in ancient days between Amomum cardamomum - or \"false\" or \"bastard\" cardamom, which the Greeks and Romans set great store by - and what was designated Elettaria cardamomum , which we know and love today. Quite how the former or the latter found their way into common usage has been obscured by wars, invasions and other such matters, although by the first century AD, Pliny was able to establish that there were four grades of cardamom, and Andrew Dalby in Dangerous Tastes (British Museum Press, \u00a316.99) gives us a recipe from the \"illustrious Vinidarius\", which puts him in mind of one of Jeeves's pick-me-ups that produced the feeling that \"somebody had touched off a bomb inside the old bean and was strolling down my throat with a lighted torch\". </p> <p>Perhaps it isn't surprising, then, that cardamom is a relative of another potent spice, ginger, and was most probably introduced to India from the east, where it was originally appreciated more for its medicinal qualities - as a decongestant, in particular - than for its culinary ones. Bearing in mind these characteristics, while saffron and cardamom pair happily in rice, whether for stuffing or as an accompaniment, it is as well to remember that with these spices less is definitely more. </p> <p> All recipes serve six. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Saffron broth</b> This is a wonderful way of using the broth left over after cooking the chicken below.

The original version of the recipe was named after the Mar\u00e9chal Suchet, who was made Duc d'Albufera by a grateful Napoleon, after the general's victories in Spain. It is an elaborate dish that I have simplified somewhat here, though, by removing the truffles and foie gras, I suspect that I have merely made it cheaper. The addition of cardamom is a happy one.

Pour in the white wine and vermouth, then add the chicken stock, saffron, bayleaf, cardamom and a little pepper. Leave the rice to cook, undisturbed, for 15 minutes, until just done. Add the fried liver and heart, and then gently scrape the whole lot into a large bowl. Carefully stir in the egg, then cover and leave to cool. </p> <p>Meanwhile, carefully make an incision along the centre of the breastbone and cut out the two breasts. With a pair of scissors, cut away the exposed breastplate. Season the inside of the chicken with salt and pepper. Put the cooked rice inside the chicken, pushing it gently into the cavity and up against the backbone. Replace the breasts of the chicken on top of the rice, thereby emulating the bird's original form, and with a trussing needle and thread, sew the breasts back together. Finally, tie the bird in several layers of muslin until completely secure. Place the bird in a very heavy pot along with: </p> <p><b> 2 peeled carrots <br> 2 peeled onions <br> 1 stick celery <br> 1 clove <br> 4 cardamom pods, cracked <br> 1 bayleaf <br> 50ml white wine <br> The breastbones from the bird<br></b> </p> <p>Fill the pot with ample water to cover the bird and bring to a simmer.

  "<p>The board game, Doley, was invented by Paul Noble, one of the five artists who have won this year's Paul Hamlyn Awards. It is a game \"for three or more players over the age of 16\", who choose to be represented by one of five characters on the board, Oblivious (&amp; Other-worldly), Burnt Out, Formless &amp; Misshapen, Ineffectual, and Aimless. \"You are now a player in Doley,\" explain the rules. \"This is what happens to you.

This is no Turner, where one of the nominated artists walks away with the prize and the rest spend the next few years getting over the whole thing. The Paul Hamlyn Awards have previously been given to artists in other fields, including composers and poets, but since 1998 have been dedicated to visual arts (publisher Paul Hamlyn's daughter, Jane Hamlyn, who runs London's Frith Street Gallery, is the guiding force). </p> <p>The aim is to provide artists with a secure income with which to nurture creativity, as well as to reward achievement.

The judges consider need as well as merit. </p> <p>For many of us, it is hard to get too tearful about the lot of young artists.

Going back further, in the 50s Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg were able to keep working only because they formed a business designing window displays for Fifth Avenue stores. </p> <p>Artists have been half-bourgeois, half-social outsiders ever since they won independence from traditional systems of aristocratic patronage. Artists earn almost nothing until and unless they become stars, names, figures of a certain perceived significance in contemporary art history. </p> <p>\"To be successful as an artist,\" wrote Andy Warhol with candour, \"you have to have your work shown in a good gallery for the same reason that, say, Dior never sold his originals from a counter in Woolworth's ... If a guy has, say, a few thousand dollars to spend on a painting, he doesn't wander along the street until he sees something lying around that 'amuses' him. He wants to buy something that's going to go up and up in value.\" </p> <p>There is a huge division between the handful of artists whose work is valued in this way and the rest for whom the occasional sale is less about a serious contribution to their income than a sign that they are, after all, an artist rather than a teacher or a decorator. In Britain today, there is a vast culture of making art, but most people who call themselves artists will never make an income from their work - until they were taken up by Jay Jopling's White Cube, for example, Jake and Dinos Chapman, notoriously, were penniless. </p> <p>Artists of the post-YBA generation are particularly skint. The style of new British art has changed, and these neo-conceptual artists, often with a political edge to their work, don't expect ever to sell that much. The Paul Hamlyn Awards are particularly suited to this new climate in the British art scene. But they are also prizes, a recognition of talent, and the five artists who have been rewarded this year include some of the most promising figures around. </p> <p>Philippe Bradshaw makes kinky decorations for the modern home. His art has a decadent, rococo feel, and his affinities for the 18th century were made explicit when he reproduced Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard's cheeky painting, The Swing (1767), in the Wallace Collection, as an image glimpsed in the shiny links of a screen of chains. This piece of chainmail erotica - combining the soft frilly art of Fragonard with a hard, modern material, fragmenting a historical work of art in a field of glimmer and glamour - is typical of the work Bradshaw is doing. </p> <p>Until recently, Bradshaw was, with Andrea Mason, part of a collaborative duo, Andrea + Philippe; they carried out site-specific interventions with a subversively decorative quality, on one occasion glazing abandoned wartime bunkers around the country and offering these desirable residences for sale at a phoney estate agency that they had set up in a gallery off the King's Road. \"This brick-rendered hexagonal pillbox has a flat concrete roof with jutting corners,\" went one parodic estate agent's blurb under a colour photo of a ruined military structure in south Wales. \"It is easily accessible via a brick porch entrance. Inside ... two pairs of pink panties have been casually tossed into the corner.\" </p> <p>Since 1998, however, Bradshaw has been working on his own, and his art has become increasingly sensuous and aesthetically ambitious, offering visions of sexy, voluptuous interiors. He plans to make a chain forest, in which he will project images from the story of Hansel and Gretel, and a chain waterfall with a papier-mch\u00e9 coracle. He says he will use the money to \"establish a secure studio\" and \"invest in a computer and digital editing set-up\". </p> <p>Jim Lambie is a psychedelic nostalgist. In ZOBOP (2000), a work that can be installed in any room, he covers the entire floor in groovy, concentric bands of multicoloured vinyl. The bands of colour vibrate and dance like a poster from Haight Ashbury; orange, magenta, lime green. ZOBOP suggests that changing the world begins at home, with a bit of crazy interior decor. We colour walls, we colour doors - why not floors? Do we leave floors plain (in today's anti- carpeting age) because they make the world feel more solid beneath our feet? If you lived with Lambie's Technicolor floor, would it change anything? </p> <p>Lambie's art looks back to a time when delirium was the tool of revolution and altered states of mind were actively pursued. At the same time, ZOBOP is a formally seductive work of art, evoking abstract painting. Twentieth-century art wanted to disrupt perceptions, destroy preconceptions and open up new Utopian ways of seeing things; Lambie wittily links these high ideals to hippy colours and psychedelic pop. </p> <p>Lambie, who studied at Glasgow School of Art, is one of the growing number of Glasgow-based artists who are making an international impact. Like other artists who work in the city, he combines dreaminess and wit, and his art is hugely engaging. The thing he hopes this award will give him is, he says, \"time\" - to plan and develop new work in an unrushed way. He also plans to get a proper studio. </p> <p>Hilary Lloyd is a Warholian observer of young people, their manners, preoccupations, dress. She makes videos of studied nonchalance, which she shows simply on TV monitors mounted on steel pedestals. There is a joke about sculpture, especially the forgotten art of portrait sculpture, in the way she shows her work. Her videos are portraits; they feature young people not doing much, wasting their time in stupid games, or doing less than that - Monika (2000) tries to build a house of cards; Dawn (1999) just sits in a chair in her lime-green suit. We are invited to study them, to see what we can see about them. </p> <p>Warhol is a specific rather than general source: Lloyd's pieces resemble his Screen Tests, in which an unblinking camera would watch people mercilessly as they tried to be funny or broke down and cried. Lloyd is more collaborative with her subjects, and the method of display makes her work more intimate. The monitors are at average human height, so it's as if we are seeing someone in the room with us. At the same time, it is like coming face to face with an 18th-century statue or portrait bust. </p> <p>Hilary Lloyd is radically different from the video artists who emerged in the early 90s: whereas, say, Douglas Gordon and Steve McQueen are intensely cinematic, she is resolutely small-scale, televisual and deliberately slight. </p> <p>Hew Locke recently created an installation at the Victoria and Albert Museum called Hemmed In II. Bulging, growing, bursting between porphyry pillars in the museum's vast entrance hall, it resembled a building, perhaps a bathhouse, a market or a religious building - it was hard to tell. In its organic clutter, it seemed to be a parody of the rambling V&amp;A itself. Locke's architectural jumble - made of nothing but cut-up cardboard stuck together with glue - was the unconscious of the museum spilling out, and the work of an artist who messes about at the margins of high culture. </p> <p>Born in Edinburgh, Locke went to school in Guyana and has said that when he returned to Britain he felt for the first time that he was seen as \"other\". His response has been to make art that engages with European high art, doing grotesque charcoal and pastel drawings based on Vel\u00e1zquez and Hogarth and, with Hemmed In II, confronting the V&amp;A with its jokey other, at once a celebration and travesty. Next year, he will develop further work in museums with a residency at the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill, south London. He is also developing his long-term plan to build a structure large enough for people to walk into, the Cardboard Palace. </p> <p>Paul Noble is a kitchen visionary, a brilliantly original satirist and producer of vile dreams whose work has almost nothing in common with what we think of as contemporary British art. Noble is a politically-minded artist - he is co-curator of the exhibition Protest And Survive at the Whitechapel Gallery - who communicates a detailed vision of the world through drawings, paintings and other activities. </p> <p>However, it is the drawing project he has been working on since 1995 that is Noble's most impressive achievement to date. He is the planner and administrator of Nobson Newtown, a modern British community that he has mapped out from the Nobslums to the Lidonob to the Nobjobclub. Noble's drawings resemble the work of MC Escher, logically extrapolating basic forms. These forms are the letters of a computer font he has designed - called Nobson. The town has its own history, archaeology and geology; in Introduction To Nobson Newtown, Noble recounts how it was built out of a unique stone found in the Nobhill Downs called Nobrock, which the earliest inhabitants of the area mistook for \"the fossilised remains of God's brains\". </p> <p>In fact, Nobrock consists of language. Every building in the town has what it is written in its fabric; the Nobslums, built in a pit into which raw sewage cascades, are little houses made of letters that together say \"nobslum\". In his latest book, Noble portrays Nobson in ruins - a cross between Milton Keynes and Pompeii. The fact that it is built out of language makes you feel it is full of secret meanings and that real life, too, is written according to a secret language in which history, location and politics determine who we are. </p> <p>Nobson is an image of narcissistic and tyrannical creativity - within the town Noble gives himself The Architect's House (Paul's Palace). Noble says he wants to use his award to complete Nobson Newtown - every building, with its elaborate construction, takes him six months to draw - and the money will be especially welcome as he has been surviving by paying low rent on his studio and living in a squat, but \"this is all due to change\". </p> <p>The British art scene today is full of young artists who say the last thing they want is to be the next Damien Hirst or Tracey Emin. Forget glamour and provocation; say hello to books of theory and the pursuit of idiosyncratic ends. </p> <p>It's an inevitable reaction, repeating the history of the 60s, when the glamour of Pop was rejected by the late 60s generation who turned to conceptual art that rejected the market. Yet it's a tricky business pinpointing precisely what's going on in contemporary British art. One moment, it looks as if art has returned to colour and decoration and all the things conceptual artists are supposed to hate; the next, young artists are all political, dry-as-dust thinkers - the tendency reflected in Intelligence: New British Art 2000 at Tate Britain. </p> <p>The truth is, the best artists around now are developing obscure, even eccentric lines of thought that are not connected to any movement or fashion; Paul Noble is one of these major talents, and if there were a first prize in the Paul Hamlyn Awards it should go to him. The unstarry, unpressured Paul Hamlyn Awards are perfectly suited to this mood, encouraging artists not to worry about anything - except making art </p> <p> <strong> Philippe Bradshaw</strong> born 1965 <br></p> <p> From Lincolnshire.

  "Two weeks have gone by, but the turmoil of those uncertain days remains seared on my mind. After the recent drama over petrol and the titanic clash between market forces and the environment, I decided to find a third way. I explored fuels other than the wretched Opec juice. Among the sites I found under 'electric car', I was most impressed by <a href=\"http://www.car-stuff.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.car-stuff.com</a>, with its broad range of links, dealers and much relevant information. <p> </p> <p>However, image matters, and none of the electric cars looked nearly as cool as the VW Beetle. Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.volkswagen.com.br\" target=\"_NEW\">www.volkswagen.com.br</a>, I discovered that the Brazilian version of the Beetle is powered by sugar-cane alcohol. Just imagine: no blackmail from the sheikhs, no fuel tax from Gordon... The only problem is that sugarcane alcohol is not that easy to find here (Bacardi is even more expensive than Shell's best), so I'd have to import a tanker-load of the stuff from Rio. It might be more realistic to do like the Queen and convert my car to liquified petroleum gas. Pleasantly scented, highly eco-friendly and lightly taxed (I mean the fuel, but HM is, too). The only drawback of LPG is that you can find it only in a few petrol stations for the time being. If you are interested, check <a href=\"http://www.autogas.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.autogas.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>Fighting with a ghastly woman at our local late-night shop over the last loaf of bread (and it wasn't Duchy of Cornwall organic!) made me realise the importance of essentials.

  "<p>When they first emerged in 1997, All Saints were a breath of fresh air. Scruffy, authentic, this was no put-together, cynically marketed band - these girls were friends, they actually hung out together. And they wrote their own songs - or at least one of them did. They may not have been an all-black band, but with songs such as the smooth, soulful hit Never Ever, they displayed that all-important feel for the nuances of R&amp;B and hip hop, not to mention a penchant for the kind of dance moves more usually seen in gangsta-girl rap. </p> <p>Not only that, but their look - tomboyish, oh-so-casual but sexy, with trainers, and baggy combat trousers slung low to reveal ever so gently rounded tummies - was a sudden and huge hit, transforming within a few months how young girls wanted to look. They didn't have to proclaim girl power; they embodied it. They followed up the single with an accomplished eponymous album in a similarly glossy and seductive vein. It went multi-platinum - that's more than 10 million copies worldwide. The following year, they scooped up two Brit awards for Never Ever and its video. </p> <p>After such an auspicious start, however, it has not been a smooth ride. Over the past couple of years, you couldn't glance at a gossip column without spotting them. First, there were the public rows and fallings out, with one or other of them threatening to leave the band. Then they began to be snapped by the tabloid press while out on the town (usually the Appleton sisters, with their latest high-profile boyfriends). Before long they were vilified for their incessant partying, drunken antics and string of suitors, the very things that had attracted the press in the first place. </p> <p>At one show, a member of the audience displayed a huge banner with the words Pure Whores emblazoned on it, a play on the title of this summer's single, Pure Shores. They gained a reputation for being stroppy and arrogant. \"The bitches are back\" went the headline for a recent men's magazine article, while one women's magazine ran the cover line, \"Why the world hates the Appleton sisters\". And then there was that venture into movies with Honest, in which all of them (bar Shaznay) acted and which bombed in the UK earlier this year. But still, the mellow, infectious Pure Shores was a huge hit - so far, it remains the biggest-selling UK single this year. And now the band are releasing a second album, Saints And Sinners. </p> <p>Today, All Saints have gathered in a north London photographic studio with a 13-strong entourage - including management, minder, hair, make-up, wardrobe, PA, PR. Nicole Appleton takes frequent calls on her mobile, gossiping and giggling happily. Natalie, her older sister, is cool but chirpy enough. Melanie Blatt is slightly stony-faced. Shaznay Lewis is quiet and amenable. </p> <p>Shaznay is the songwriter - and the one with the extraordinary helium-voiced singing style. She grew up on the Caledonian Road, north London, and says there was always music playing at home: Bob Marley, Johnny Mathis, Calypso, Curtis Stigers. \"I never for a split-second thought about doing anything else,\" she says. She's in jeans, a grey \"Harlem\" sweatshirt and no make-up. She's startlingly beautiful, big-eyed and long-lashed: a child-woman face. Now 25, she wrote her first song at 13, while attending a music workshop at her local youth club. Unusually, around that same time she converted to Catholicism, although she went to a Church of England school. She was taken to Mass by a neighbour. \"I'm amazed my mum let me do it. I think the idea of me being able to dress up in a bright gown and take bread in front of the altar boys was appealing to me,\" she laughs. </p> <p>She didn't get a job when she left school, but signed on the dole to pursue her music, which her mother found slightly weird, \"because no matter what job she'd done in life, she'd never depended on government money to bring me and my sister up\". Her Jamaican mother still works as a dinner lady. \"Not for herself. It's in case I hit a rainy day, or my sister, or anyone in my family. That's the kind of person she is.\" Her father is Barbadian and a retired bus driver. \"We were the richest of the poor,\" she says of her childhood. </p> <p>Shaznay met Melanie Blatt at All Saints studio in west London, where both were session singers, experimenting with demos. They joined forces, and spent three years signing on and fronting All Saints. They reckoned they were given \"bad advice\", and decided to take matters into their own hands. They were soon joined by the Appleton sisters - and signed up by London Records. </p> <p>Shaznay wrote the melancholy Never Ever and the debut album just after she and her ex-boyfriend had split up. For this new album, she says, she couldn't \"dig out the sad songs\", because for the past couple of years she's been in a happy, stable relationship with Christian Storm, a dancer. So, Saints And Sinners is a more upbeat affair (both Natalie and Mel wrote tracks, too, but the rest are Shaznay's work), and there are four tracks (including the particularly infectious Black Coffee) produced by William Orbit, who has also worked with Madonna. The vocals are tighter this time around, though the formula is similar to before - breakbeats or samples, with harmonies over the top. Shaznay is proud of the \"quirky, comical\" tracks on the album, and makes no excuses for her \"commercial lyrics\". Not that all of the music she listens to is uniformly commercial - she cites Alanis Morissette, Everlast, House of Pain, Sonique and Artful Dodger as current favourites. And she loves rap: \"Not the violent kind of rap, but I look at it as an interesting form of poetry.\" During the making of the album, there was some pressure from the record company to \"do a Destiny's Child\", as Shaznay puts it. \"They were going through that phase, you know, they'd been watching too much MTV. So we went off and tried it, but it sounded too R&amp;B, so we kind of closed our ears to everybody after a while.\" </p> <p>In the past few years, Shaznay has been far less visible than the other All Saints. She says that she doesn't party so much any more, and that when she does it's only for a \"big occasion\". Her relatively low profile has also, no doubt, been due to her non-appearance in Honest, which featured Natalie, Nicole and Mel as East End sisters involved in a heist in London's swinging 60s. Although the girls' performances were praised, the hugely hyped gangster movie failed dismally, despite a glitzy premiere at Cannes this year, with director Dave Stewart blaming its 18 certificate (there are drug-taking and orgy scenes). Shaznay wasn't invited to audition because there was no role suitable for her. </p> <p>She hasn't seen the film yet, she says. She chose not to go to the premiere - it was the day before a promotional trip, she explains carefully, and she wanted to spend time with her loved ones. She had planned to see it in Los Angeles, but it had been withdrawn early from general release. Was she upset that she wasn't asked to be involved? \"Maybe I would have been a bit peeved if I'd been sat at home doing nothing. But at the time the girls were doing the film, I went into the recording studio in LA and wrote Pure Shores.\" She pauses, and smiles. \"So it worked out fine.\" </p> <p>Wasn't there ever some inkling of feeling exploited, of grafting while the others swanned around? \"If I look at it from their point of view, the girls probably felt even more the need to find something that they could call their own - though the music that I write they could never not call their own: it is theirs, it's for all of us. I don't class them as my songs; I class them as our songs. But something that they could go off and say, 'Yeah, I did that by myself', that's what they needed to do, so who am I to throw a fit about it?\" </p> <p>She concedes, however, that she had misgivings about the film. \"The only thing I was a bit gutted about was that, during the whole lead-up to the film, I kept pointing out, 'They're calling it an All Saints film, and it's not.'\" This had nothing to do with the fact that she wasn't in it, she says. Just that, good or bad, she wanted the girls to be able to come back to the band afterwards untouched by it and able to continue with their musical careers. \"It wasn't the girls themselves who were trying to associate it with All Saints,\" she's quick to point out. \"What they were trying to do at the time was get away from being All Saints.\" Dave Stewart, then? \"Yeah, totally. People are going to do that to bring in the buyers and the attention. They're going to call it an All Saints film.\" </p> <p>If anyone in the group is the leader, it's Shaznay. Not only is she the songwriter, but she also has a level-headedness about her that you'd imagine would come in handy in a band such as this one. \"People may look to me as a group leader, though I like to be in the background. But I show people both sides of the coin.\" She is the diplomatic one. When she does lose her temper, it shocks people, she says. \"Nat can take a leadership role in the sense where she'll blow her top in the first few seconds. A lot of the time I'll go, 'Oh, Natalie', and be embarrassed, then there are other times when it's called for - and, then again, there are times when it is really called for and she doesn't do it, and you're like, 'Go on, Nat'.\" </p> <p>Because they came together as friends, rather than as a money-making proposition, All Saints have always behaved as such - hence the public rows and drunken exploits. \"Young commercial bands don't really do things like that,\" she says. \"That sort of stuff is associated with the rock'n'roll bands. But I'm really glad that we've always been who we were from the beginning.\" The music industry is \"a big money-making machine, and the ones who get, excuse my French, fucked over are the ones who are really into music. The industry isn't interested in that. That's why record companies will always love manufacturing bands because it's a case of being told what to do, when to do it: 'Sing this hit song that's been written by so-and-so, and it's a smash and you look fabulous.' \" </p> <p>But then, All Saints have hardly turned their backs on glamour, have they? From the start, their look has been unequivocally sexy. \"We're four kind of cheeky girls, we're quite daring. But the funny thing is, we never actually tried to be sexy. At the time, we wanted to be like tomboys. You've got a lot of these female artists that come out now in bikinis. It's too try-hard and 'Please say I'm sexy'. With us, it was baggy pants and maybe a g-string hanging out because the pants were so big and heavy, but people took to that more.\" </p> <p>Most of their fans are young girls, she says, most are white and most have their favourite - which is always Nicole, Natalie or Mel. \"Which I can understand, because they're not going to relate to me - they're not going to be able to do their hair like me, or whatever. But it has made me wonder if I appeal to little black girls. I hope I do.\" She admires artists such as Lauryn Hill, who have an audience that is racially mixed. \"In the beginning, you don't think of those things. In the area where I grew up, it was very mixed and it was never an issue to me. I was never brought up to think of black or white in any way, shape or form, but now I'm dead proud when I've looked down and seen black people at the front!\" </p> <p>Shaznay has no plans to go solo for the moment, and says that, when she eventually has children, she won't want to be doing what she's doing now. \"I'll want to be at home, just being a mum.\" Fame and success have made her \"tougher\", but they have also made her \"long for normality. I have kind of regained that. When I go home and shut the door, I'm just Shaznay Lewis from Caledonian Road. But then it's Shaznay Lewis getting into a flash car,\" she adds with a laugh. She owns a convertible Audi and a Jeep Cherokee - as the writer in the band, she gets considerably larger royalties than the others. </p> <p>When it comes to celebrity, however, Shaznay maintains that you have to take the rough with the smooth. She was \"surprised\" when she was photographed on holiday with her boyfriend in Barbados earlier this year, but not angry. \"I keep my guard up so that I'm unaffected by all of it. Sometimes the girls get upset about things that are said about them, and sometimes they're quite happy to see it. I think, personally, you should feel one way about all of it, so that regardless of whatever's been printed you're always going to feel a certain way inside. You will always be able to keep your composure.\" </p> <p>Melanie Blatt used to be known as the \"mouthy\" one. Not any more, she says. \"I've calmed down a lot.\" She slouches on the sofa with a picturesquely petulant look about her. She lives in south London with Stuart Zender, former bass player with Jamiroquai, and their little girl, Lily. Zender co-produced one of the tracks on Saints And Sinners, along with former Young Disciple, Femi Williams. </p> <p>Mel's French mother and English father were hippies who named her after the 60s singer Melanie and took her to Glastonbury when she was nine months old. She had ambitions to be a ballet dancer, but that was ruled out after an operation on her spine, so she went to the Sylvia Young Theatre School, where she met Nicole and Natalie (along with Emma Bunton, later to be Baby Spice). </p> <p>Much of Blatt's childhood was spent in France, and Shaznay was her first real female friend in London. \"We're very compatible,\" she says. The early years weren't always easy: \"When you look back on it, it was a struggle sometimes, but I'm glad we went through those years, really working hard. I like to work.\" </p> <p>She never thought that they'd be a pop band; rather an \"underground\" band, famous perhaps in west London. Not that she minds, of course. When they first became well known, she had \"a good six months\" of going out and being seen, \"when it was all new and exciting. It's nice to walk in somewhere and everyone goes, 'Ooh!' \" she laughs. \"That's nice, but it can only last so long.\" </p> <p>Mel doesn't seem bothered by the band's reputation for stroppiness.\"There are certain rules that you have to play by, which we don't, which is why we have press attention. And it's like they always say: if a man doesn't want to do something, he's strong, but if you're a woman you're a fucking bitch.\" Has it made her tougher, being in this industry? \"You can never trust anybody 100% in this business, that's why you have to be strong.\" </p> <p>She didn't much enjoy making the film, she says. \"No, not really. It was too long on one project.\" As for more acting, \"maybe, but I wouldn't take it seriously. I'm a singer.\" She's a no-nonsense kind of girl, Mel - she has a life outside all of this, and that is her priority. She thinks she may buy a house in France eventually, but for the moment they'll stay in south London. How long does she think she'll continue with All Saints? \"I'd like there to be a tenth album, just to say 'ha ha' to people who've doubted us. But, realistically, with Lily I can't do this for the rest of my life.\" </p> <p>In contrast to Mel, Nicole Appleton has a breezy way about her, smiley, sunny and irrepressibly cheerful - as well she might. New album, new man: life is just peachy for the beautiful (they're all beautiful) Nicole. She is unrelentingly upbeat, even on the subject of her film debut. \"I thought I didn't really do such a bad job, so I'm not going to feel totally ripped to pieces. I've become fairly ballsy about it.\" She finds it hard when people close to her are affected by criticism of her. \"But otherwise, I couldn't give a shit. I'd be in the madhouse if I did. It's just part of my job.\" </p> <p>She beams broadly. From the age of 18 or 19, Nicole (now 25) was always the one who wanted to go out, to have fun, she says in her transatlantic drawl (which she's \"dying\" to get rid of). And she always wanted to perform. She and her sisters (there are two others, as well as Natalie) were born and raised in Canada to British parents. When their parents split, they lived first with their mother in New York state and then in London with their father, where they attended Sylvia Young's school. Then came a return to the US and unsuccessful attempts to get into showbusiness. Their parents got back together, and the sisters returned to Britain, where a chance meeting with Mel's father at the Sports Cafe in London, where Nicole was waitressing, led to a reunion with their old theatre-school friend. Mel asked the sisters to join a band she had formed with Shaznay. All Saints became a foursome, and their careers took off. </p> <p>After the success of the first album, Nicole found that suddenly she was \"a somebody\". She received a lot of \"positive attention\" when she and Robbie Williams got engaged. She loved it. \"Totally. The world was my best friend. I would say to the reporters, 'This is what Robbie and I are doing', and, 'We're going to move here.'\" But after they split up, she found that the tone of the stories changed, and became more and more lurid - there was always a list of men attached to her name. \"It all started going fucking AWOL for me. It was, like, everything I did ... I'm supposed to have this reputation. I'm considered this bad person and I'm so not.\" </p> <p>There have been a few stories that she says are just not true. The in-the-toilet-with-Leonardo-DiCaprio was one such: \"That was kind of embarrassing for my family, and so not my style, anyway. I would never, even in some private house with a guy I'm seeing - in the toilet! It just doesn't work like that.\" Some of the men she's been linked to (such as Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt), she claims never to have even met. Men don't get that, she says. Whereas figures such as Robbie Williams are congratulated in the press for their string of affairs (Williams encourages girlfriends to sell stories about his sexual prowess, she claims), it's a different story for women. The plastic surgery story (it was reported that she'd had a liposuction operation on her thighs) she says was also untrue: \"I did have a dream that I had a breast job, and I was surrounded by people and I was standing there going, 'Don't touch me, don't touch me!' It was a dream, though.\" </p> <p>There were other, more serious difficulties to contend with, as well - such as the stalker who harassed her for a month earlier this year. She reacted angrily, going out in the evenings by herself. \"It was really wrong of me to do that, and I got yelled at about it by my family, but it's just your natural reaction if someone's invading you.\" In the end, she and a male friend confronted the stalker, and it stopped. \"I just got really worried about my family, that's the only thing that can really get to me. Someone fucks with my family and that's it.\" She seems a robust kind of girl, but not quite as combative as she, in common with the rest of the band, has been characterised. How does she think they gained that reputation? \"Well, if we're gonna have a fight, we're gonna fight. We're not going to say, 'Let's go somewhere in private and have a fight.' We've had loads of fights.\" </p> <p>At one point it was reported that she was leaving the band. She wasn't getting on with their then manager, she says, she'd begun to feel like a \"robot\" and simply wanted a break. \"It's very difficult to be friends and have a business relationship.\" The differences they had were caused by the people around them. \"That's why we got rid of a lot of people at the beginning of the year. We changed our management, got rid of lawyers. It was just not working, it wasn't right. We were just not getting anywhere.\" It was she who initiated all of that, she says. \"There were a lot of blowouts because I felt like I was the only one trying to make a point.\" Of course, the situation may not have been helped by the fact that three of them went off for a prolonged period to make the film. How must Shaznay have felt? \"She was so supportive,\" says Nicole, \"but I don't know if that's how she felt ...\" </p> <p>Now all of these difficulties are behind her, and Nicole is thoroughly delighted with life. Her new boyfriend, Liam Gallagher of Oasis, is an \"absolute top gem\" and \"totally rooted\". She's certainly not fazed by his hell-raiser reputation; in fact, she's suspicious of \"squeaky-clean\" celebrities - the ones who are portrayed as the bad ones are generally the more honest, she says. \"If they want to tell someone to fuck off, then they will.\" She grins contentedly - she is smitten, and is not pretending otherwise. It sounds like love's young dream. With Robbie, she says, she sensed a certain, albeit unspoken, competitiveness in the relationship, but with Liam it's \"totally different\", and he is supportive of her music and career. And he's met her mother. He surprised her: she'd had a vision in her head of how he might be with her, \"like everyone else, thinking, 'Oh my God.' But they were sitting there - yak, yak, yak.\" </p> <p>Nicole does not get involved in Liam's troubles with Patsy Kensit, from whom he is now divorced: as far as she's concerned, it's none of her business. \"He doesn't come to me and tell me his problems. That's something he's had to deal with, and still has to deal with. I just want him to be happy and that's it.\" </p> <p>\"I've learnt my lesson,\" she says, puffing on a Silk Cut. \"I've been there, I've been everywhere, every club, had a great time, but it's time to calm down.\" Whether that ambition is altogether realistic remains to be seen, but she loves England, she loves the rain, the pubs, the food. If she were to buy another home, it would be in Ireland (her mother is Irish, she says). She's not ready to settle down and have babies, though. \"Work's too full-on at the moment, I just couldn't handle it. If I was pregnant now I'd probably, I don't know, just be really emotional and sick all over the place.\" </p> <p>Nicole's enthusiasm about Liam is touching. \"You'd love him! You'd think, Nic was right, he's great.\" She thinks the fact that they are both so busy will help keep the relationship exciting. She doesn't know if she's in love yet, but, \"It feels really right. That's what's scary. I don't want to get hurt, no one ever does, do they? But you know,\" she beams, \"I think if I can't do it, I don't know who can.\" </p> <p>Nicole's older sister, Natalie, who's 26, used to be an aerobics instructor - probably a very fierce and effective one. Her eyes brim with indignation. She was particularly unamused by the \"Why the world hates the Appleton sisters\" line: \"I thought, 'Holy shit, what is that all about?' The world hates us? Are we responsible for the war in Bosnia? Are we responsible for the Millennium Dome?\" </p> <p>She is famous for flying off the handle on a regular basis. Get her on certain topics, and she seethes with rage. \"They put Nic and me down, and say we're party animals. And women can be very catty about us. It's upsetting because I'm a woman's woman, and I'm against all that home-wrecking stuff. You don't fuck around with your friends' boyfriends. It happens a lot in this business, and everyone pretends to be goody-two-shoes, and Nic and I are the only ones who get any shit, and we're the ones who don't do stuff like that. I could just expose so many goody-two-shoes.\" Her mobile phone rings. It's Donna Air, the MTV presenter. \"She's moving in next door,\" she says, more calmly. \"She'll be coming round to borrow the sugar - or the vodka.\" She laughs. </p> <p>Natalie has a daughter, Rachel, who is eight years old. The father left the short-lived marriage one year after she was born, \"when I needed the help more than anything. I was on my own, no help, nothing.\" Being a single parent is \"the toughest thing in the world\". In the past year, the father has started seeing his daughter again, once a week or so. Natalie is \"kind of bitter\", and \"totally cynical\" about men (hardly any wonder, given the unedifying kiss-and-tell conduct of some of her exes). Still, that may have changed by now. A week or so after our chat, she started seeing Liam Howlett of the Prodigy (the Appleton sisters went on holiday this summer to the south of France, with both Liams in tow). She finds success sexy, she says, which may account both for Howlett and her past two long-term boyfriends - TV presenter Jamie Theakston (\"We're good friends now. He's an adult and he's smart. I get advice from him every now and then\") and actor Jonny Lee Miller. </p> <p>She approves of her sister's latest choice of man. \"He is such a big pussycat, and he's honest. He's spent a lot of time with my family. He's just a great, great person. He's always got a good thing to say. If people upset him, he'll have a go because he gets hurt. But, you know, everything we do musically, he's just, like, 'That's fuckin' great.' You can't condemn him if it doesn't work out, because he's still a young guy, and he got married at 22, and he needs to enjoy his life. Whatever happens between him and Nic, it doesn't matter. I'll always love him to death, and he'll always have us as friends.\" </p> <p>Does she want more children? \"I so want more. I want a home and family and husband. That's what I'm after now. The day I can afford to retire, I will, and I'll sing for fun. Even if All Saints don't exist, I'll still be Natalie Appleton, I'll still want to perform.\" </p> <p>Perhaps it's the Sylvia Young showbiz training. The Appleton sisters, like Mel, give the impression that All Saints is a job, not an all-consuming passion. If they hadn't done this, they would no doubt have found some other careers in the performing arts. With Shaznay, it's different: she never wanted to do anything else - for her, it is a compulsion. She, too, has a life outside All Saints, but you get the feeling that her love of music is something that she would have pursued regardless of success and the convertible parked outside. </p> <p>Just so long as Shaznay keeps those songs coming, All Saints should do fine. Without her songs, however - and, I'd guess, without her calming influence - they wouldn't exist. For a while it looked as if All Saints would implode, but not now. </p> <p>They may fall out, they may get drunk and lairy, but, if anything, it's their sulky, stroppy, bad-girl ways that is their appeal. It always has been. They probably know that - why else call the album Saints And Sinners? There's a what-you-see-is-what-you-get quality about them. They tell it like it is. It's tough being a single mother. Men can be crap. It's fun going out with Liam Gallagher. It's fun to drink vodka, or pints of lager. It's nice to be famous, up to a point. </p> <p>It's six o'clock, and the photoshoot is done. The girls are scooped up by their minder into a top-of-the-range people-carrier. Natalie and Nicole are off out for a drink with some starry friends at a newly opened bar. Mel's off home to south London. And Shaznay's working day has just begun - it's back to the recording studio for her, to put some final touches to the album </p> <p> \u0095 The album Saints And Sinners is released on October 16.</p>",
  "<p>Miles Davis wrote in his autobiography that jazz in the early 1980s was becoming \"the music of the museum\". Courtney Pine, the man who has done most in Britain to reverse that trend, was awarded the OBE in the 2000 new year's honours \"for services to jazz music\". But when, on tour in Russia, he was asked by a child why he got the OBE, he simply said: \"For playing the saxophone.\" </p> <p>The musician and composer Pine spearheaded Britain's jazz revival of the mid-1980s, becoming a catalyst and icon for the burgeoning first generation of black British jazz musicians, and a performer of world renown. But his response to the Russian child is revealing not only for his modest disavowal of role model status, but for the focused integrity of his approach to music. </p> <p>At the launch of his jazz career he was ubiquitous on TV and magazine covers as the 80s image of cool, in sharp suit and red beret, his saxophone a potent visual prop. But he made a level-headed vow to the music press: \"When you stop talking to me, I'll still be practising.\" His longevity in a notoriously fickle industry has borne this out. </p> <p>At 36, 14 years after he cut his first album, Pine is widely - if still sometimes grudgingly - acknowledged to be Britain's most popular and influential jazz artist; the nearest thing in British jazz to a household name. His debut recording in 1986, Journey To The Urge Within, was the first jazz album to enter the UK top 40 pop charts, and went on to sell more than 120,000 copies. His subsequent albums have sold steadily, averaging 60,000 copies each - not much for a pop star to sing about, but enviable in modern British jazz. </p> <p>He has broadened the music's appeal for a new generation, partly by a controversial fusion of acoustic jazz with other musical forms - from reggae, soul and afro-beat to hip-hop, drum 'n' bass and jungle - helping steer it to club audiences and dance floors. According to John Cumming, co-director of the London Jazz Festival, part of Pine's challenge is that \"he hasn't stood still. Throughout the history of jazz there's been resistance to new energy that might take the music in an unfamiliar direction; the reaction to bebop, to Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie in the 40s, was probably as severe as what Courtney's faced.\" </p> <p>He has shrewdly shared stages not only with such US jazz stars as the veteran pianist Ellis Marsalis, father of the jazz dynasty, and the diva Cassandra Wilson, but with rock and pop icons such as Mick Jagger and Elton John. His high-profile performances range from Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday concert at Wembley stadium in 1988 to the BBC1 Windrush gala concert which he directed in 1998 and the Archbishop of Canterbury's millennium show last year. </p> <p>Yet Pine speaks more about \"practice\" (eight hours a day) and \"research\" (he devours biographies) than exposure. \"If someone's a jazz musician, there's no hype; it's based on live experience,\" he says. A large and charismatic figure, who has swapped suit and tie for dreadlocks and Tommy Hilfiger casuals, he enjoys comparison with the US musician Wynton Marsalis, \"who's doing something a black man shouldn't be doing - being the best classical and jazz trumpeter in the world\". But he radiates a humble, clearly genuine missionary zeal. \"Jazz is creative music; it's the best music in the world. It can elevate people to a higher consciousness.\" </p> <p>His status owes much to this dedication and to sheer virtuosity. The Guardian's jazz critic, John Fordham, sees him as \"a phenomenal technician, drawing together styles from early jazz to experimental and avant-garde. His playing can be amazingly abstract, atonal, dissonant, but with such a strong underlying groove that it makes sense to a non-specialist audience. He's made the most advanced jazz of the last 30 years work with musical forms that are popular and accessible, even if he's not yet transformed the structure in the way of Miles Davis, Ornette Coleman or John Coltrane.\" </p> <p>Pine's 10th album, Back In The Day, is released on Monday, while his career is broadening out, not least as a DJ and presenter. Courtney Pine's Jazz Crusade is on Radio 2 on Monday evenings, following last year's six-part Jazz for the Millennium on the same station, and a BBC2 documentary on South Africa, Bands Apart, will be screened in October. He composed and performed the scores of two new British films: History is Made at Night, directed by Ilkka Jarvilaturi; and It Was An Accident, directed by Metin Huseyin, which opens on October 24, and for which Pine has been nominated \"best newcomer off screen\" in the British Independent Film Awards. Billed as a highlight of the London Jazz Festival in November, he will also be the subject of a South Bank Show that month. </p> <p>The new album was produced by Pine - whose instruments include soprano and tenor saxophone, bass clarinet, flutes and keyboard. He approached it \"like a DJ\", remixing himself, \"thinking about tempo and beats, not just scales and keys\". He calls it \"more of a personal statement\" than its predecessors, and it highlights soul influences from the 70s, with covers (destined for singles) of Gil Scott-Heron, Curtis Mayfield and Joan Armatrading sung by rising stars of UK rhythm and blues: Lynden David Hall, Beverley Knight and Kele Le Roc. </p> <p>The use of his live touring band, \"to make the album more British\", reflects a commitment to nurturing UK musicians that has marked his career. Many young musicians got their first breaks through his bands. Knight, who welcomes jazz as \"an antidote to a music industry obsessed with throwaway pop\", praises Pine's approach as \"unassuming: he gets behind you and gently pushes; he doesn't erect a soap box to stand on, or go about in a blaze of glory\". </p> <p>For the bassist Gary Crosby, Pine has been \"all-important in creating a more multiracial face to British jazz\", while the guitarist Cameron Pierre, a long-time friend and associate of Pine, believes \"young black musicians look up to him, and what he's achieved in a difficult climate, where black folks need to be twice as good to succeed\". Pine has spurred not only his contemporaries but also a rising generation of jazz artists, including saxophonists Denys Baptiste, Jason Yarde and Soweto Kinch, pianist Alex Wilson and singer Julie Dexter. </p> <p>\"He still gets crucified in certain quarters out of envy,\" Pierre adds, \"but they're eating good because of Courtney. Fifteen years ago, jazz in this country was dead and buried; it was an old, middle-class thing; a few middle-aged white men going down to Ronnie Scott's or the Flag and Firkin. Now more young people are going to jazz concerts than ever before - and that's down to Courtney Pine.\" </p> <p>Pine was born in London in 1964 and spent his early years in the numbered avenues off the Harrow Road, the northern fringes of the Notting Hill carnival. His parents, Keith, a carpenter, and Violet, a local authority housing manager, had arrived from Jamaica in the 1950s. His father played ska on a gramophone in the front room. \"I did all my playing on the avenues,\" says Pine. \"There was always music out of the African experience and the Caribbean - Dominican, Bajan, Jamaican, Trinidadian, Cuban. It was such a mixture of styles, you got energy from growing up in that.\" </p> <p>When Courtney was 14, the family moved to Kingsbury in north-west London, where he went to school with Frank Tontoh, now a session drummer, whose father ran the African rock band Osibisa. Pine recalls the late musician with residual awe: \"Mac Tontoh in a flashy red Lancer and leather pants: he was the black superstar; he was Shaft, and he played the trumpet. He'd play jazz records and take us to the studio. It's so important to listen to the elders, people who can tell you the short cuts. That's what Mac did for me. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be playing music.\" </p> <p>Pine took Grade 8 classical clarinet at school, taught himself the saxophone from the age of 14, but was drawn with his peers to soul, funk and reggae, and to the sound systems that were as much social nerve centres for mobilising black youth as entertainment. He moonlighted playing saxophone in reggae bands, \"living a musical life, then coming back on Monday to do school assembly as a prefect\". </p> <p>He began music A-Level, but was of a generation of black pupils failed by schools. \"There were two of us: a white violinist and me. I was an average student, but the teacher said I wasn't going to pass and that I should leave. I couldn't understand why that pathway to education shouldn't be open. The schoolteacher made my decision for me.\" He left, aged 16. </p> <p>When he became \"a horn man for hire\", his parents, \"deeply religious\" Methodists, were aghast. They thought it \"a joke, a flighty thing. Mum refused to believe I wouldn't go back into education; I was supposed to be a doctor. No-one else in the family played an instrument; music didn't fit into the plan.\" This spring, when he invited his parents to go with him to receive his OBE from the Queen, \"they said they were working. That generation of West Indians planned to come over for five years, but they're still paying off bills. They said 'well done'.\" </p> <p>Leaving home, he joined a reggae band \"for hire to the stars\". \"It's nice to be in a community of musicians. I love reggae music - the lyrics, the beats - working with Aswad, Rankin Dread, Al Campbell.\" In 1981 he toured Europe with the band Clint Eastwood &amp; General Saint, meeting Manu Dibango, to whose Afro-jazz he pays homage on his new album. Pine calls it \"a different education: being in a reggae band gave me a life experience\" - not least of the \"sus\" laws and police harassment that helped spark the urban uprisings of 1981. \"We were on our way to a gig and we wit nessed an accident. The police just started arresting black people and I ended up in a cell.\" </p> <p>He once admitted to having been \"out of control\" as a teenager. \"I had the reggae lifestyle - of drugs, drinking, groupies, being arrested - that travelling musicians will have to encounter and grow from. At 16 you want to know what the world tastes like; you just go for it.\" But while at school, Pine had been enthralled by the jazz saxophonist Grover Washington on TV, and picked out the Sonny Rollins record Way Out West in the library (\"It had the best cover\"). He was hooked. He played along to the instrumental B-sides of ska records by Jamaican jazz pioneers such as Roland Alphonso and Tommy McCook, then moved on to John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Louis Armstrong. </p> <p>His practising began in earnest. \"It's like calling up spirits; you learn different sounds then move on to someone else.\" Cameron Pierre, who toured with him in 1981 and is godfather to his daughter Isis, recalls the teenage Pine as \"fresh-faced and very English, the first serious musician I met: If you phoned between 8pm and 2am, you wouldn't find him. The guys in the band were upset; they said he practised too much. He was always destined to be a jazz man; he had the vision years ago.\" </p> <p>Another \"stabilising\" influence, says Pine, was his wife to be, June Guishard, now a senior child psychologist in Lambeth who has just completed a PhD. They met around sound systems when she was a student at Hull University. Married five years ago, they have been together since the early 80s, with a son of 14, Jemaal (who plays the double bass), and three daughters, ranging from seven to three. \"It's nice to have someone who's not a musician but can understand the madness. There's no competitiveness,\" he says. </p> <p>The couple formed the Abibi Jazz Arts Group to encourage young black talent at a time when, ironically, given the form's African-American roots, jazz was the preserve of white players. Pine later became a founder member of the Jazz Warriors, the now-famous big band that was a crucial training ground for talent and the African and Caribbean-inflected sound of black British jazz. </p> <p>Pine had found early enthusiasts in musicians such as saxophonist Steve Williamson and the flautist Philip Bent. \"We weren't college students; we played and loved jazz, but we weren't allowed to get up and jam in the clubs,\" he recalls. \"So we'd group together and practise in the toilet. White guys would come on stage with music - we read music, by the way - and play mellow and pretty. We'd get up on stage, knock the music down, and take over, then the owners would turn the lights off. Over a year, we shut down all the jam sessions.\" </p> <p>Unsung West Indian forerunners in Britain, such as the pioneers of European freeform jazz in the 1960s, Joe Harriott and Shake Keane, and the trumpeter Harry Beckett, were heroes of Pine - as was Ernest Ranglin who, he says, wasn't allowed on stage in Ronnie Scott's in 1964. \"Chris Blackwell had to insist, and he blew them away. Andy Hamilton was a great saxophonist from Jamaica who came to Birmingham in the 50s, but he made his first record in his 70s. I've learned you have to be in control; you have to understand the nature of capitalism. It's not just about a scale and a note; that you play saxophone and get acknowledged. There's a lot of knowledge required to gain longevity as a jazz musician.\" </p> <p>Pine answered an advertisement in the Voice newspaper to teach jazz at Community Music Ltd in Clerkenwell, a charity working with children and schizophrenic patients. Its director was the late John Stevens, \"a white free-jazz drummer who gave me a rare opportunity. I saw you could play jazz on stage with anyone, handicapped or otherwise, of any ability, as opposed to only working with the cream.\" </p> <p>While on a residency in south London, Pine was spotted for Island Records at the Atlantic pub in Coldharbour Lane. \"It was really dodgy, they were selling drugs, and guys would try and beat me up because I wasn't from Brixton. The owner had the idea that jazz could get rid of the evil element. I had six record offers out of that.\" </p> <p>Trevor Wyatt, then of Island Records (which signed Pine for \u00a31,000), recalls his \"extraordinary tone and spirit on the saxophone; it wasn't a rip off of American jazz - he had something unique\". Others even then saw a leader with a sense of destiny. Fordham recalls the teenage performer as \"still raw but with fantastic technique and confidence. He seemed to have a picture of himself as someone who would do things.\" </p> <p>His timing was inadvertently perfect, as he and other jazz musicians, including Andy Sheppard and Tommy Smith, became the soundtrack to the Thatcherite 80s. Fordham explains: \"With all that money in the economy, a new, young, champagne-and-red-braces class was looking for art forms that were emblems of quality but not dusty old high culture.\" </p> <p>But Pine's allure for a rising generation of black Britons looking for a challenge - he was likened by Fordham to the Pied Piper - outlived the 80s jazz vogue. \"The so-called jazz boom didn't really mean anything to me - the fashion, the image,\" Pine says. \"When I was at school, kids like me were buying \u00a320 Japanese records; we went to clubs to dance to jazz music. Then you got the Conservative government; jazz in a suit and tie. My approach to music just seemed to fit the template. But we were into something different.\" </p> <p>Yet the glamorous newcomers in the media spotlight put some noses out of joint. Pine remembers snide jokes about \"a black man wearing a suit and getting a record deal\". He says: \"The owner of one club in London said black musicians hadn't made a contribution to jazz in this country since the 50s. So I went down there and sorted a couple of people out - by playing.\" </p> <p>Some early detractors dismissed him as a Coltrane disciple. \"I thought it was a huge compliment: am I really that good? They didn't realise how powerful Coltrane was; he had a hard time in England in the 60s - a black man working with intelligence and harmonic knowledge. The Americans snapped me up.\" </p> <p>Pine became a session musician for touring US stars, such as Art Blakey and George Russell. His album Destiny's Song (1988), produced by Delfeayo Marsalis (the youngest of the clan), went into the US jazz charts. He then cut The Vision's Tale (1989) in New York, with Ellis Marsalis. Yet he turned down an invitation to join Blakey's Jazz Messengers, despite a glowing potential career in hard-core, bop-oriented US jazz. \"I've never really liked the tempo,\" he says of the country. \"It comes from being English and reserved - not into me, me, me. My American friends would say, 'Why don't you show more pizazz?'\" </p> <p>He also sees a hard choice facing jazz musicians: \"To stay in the practice room, the ivory tower, or go out to the rave. In America the vogue is to approach jazz like classical music; to give the perfect rendition of icons like Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker, as though you were approaching Bach or Shostakovich. Jazz says improvise, but it's limited: how would Thelonious Monk play it or Ella Fitzgerald sing it? I wasn't happy. I thought jazz was supposed to be about freedom.\" </p> <p>He looked for inspiration in his own own background. \"I'm not an American from New Orleans whose father is a musician carrying on the legacy. I had to keep it real. After I got to a certain point with my playing, I thought it should reflect my culture in a positive way - the Scratchlights, Bob Marley, Black Uhuru, sound systems, Shaka, blues parties, Linford Christie; who I am as a UK black.\" </p> <p>He had first gone to Jamaica with his mother, aged nine. \"I was petrified. I remember the stifling, porridge-like heat. I didn't drink the goat's milk.\" But he returned at 21, on holiday with his wife and son. \"It was very liberating to see black people in power. You like yourself more.\" Pine cut his \"first reggae album\", Closer To Home (1990), in Jamaica with the reggae producer Gussie Clarke. \"A lot of critics couldn't hear the reggae bass lines before. After that album, they stopped asking.\" </p> <p>Then events altered his course. His six children were all born prematurely; only four survived. Two-day-old Shana died in his arms, but he was in the US when his first daughter, Cleopatra, died in 1991. \"I was on tour with some obnoxious, hostile American musicians. I became a father, and was elated, then two days later, I wasn't. Cleopatra opened up my mind to things I take for granted, made me see more clearly. </p> <p>\"People who are jealous of a little success, I don't have time for them. There's more to life.\" It was also a time of financial crisis, after losing a legal suit over management and owing \u00a350,000. \"I was 11.59 to bankruptcy, and I was managing myself. I thought I can't just be playing standards in the American jazz tradition. It liberated me to incorporate more of who I am, starting with Africa.\" To The Eyes Of Creation (1992) [which Pine produced and dedicated to Cleopatra], integrated African, Caribbean and Indian influences - he had begun to work with the British Asian fusion artist Talvin Singh. </p> <p>\"This record shouldn't have happened yet. But because of Cleopatra, I felt, 'do it now - I don't know how long life is'. She made me get to that place earlier.\" He said he wanted people to \"hear what it means to be an African West Indian European\". </p> <p>Pine's dreadlocks (\"I've gone through many hairstyles\") are not an emblem of Rastafarianism. \"In terms of supporting one religion, I'm researching.\" But his album made explicit a more diffuse spiritual side to his music. \"I've been able to connect to religious rhythms - Yoruba, Shango - that take you back to Egypt, one of the great civilisations of Africa. The music isn't just about a catchphrase of a solo, but something deeper. It comes straight from the Creator. For me, it's a religious experience.\" </p> <p>The rapper Guru's Jazzmatazz album, on which Pine collaborated in 1993, was another turning point, that led to his albums Modern Day Jazz Stories (1996) and Underground (1997). He brought in DJ Pogo on turntables, Sparkii and the rapper MC Mello, using electronic dance music, sampling and scratching. The two albums were remixed on Another Story by Roni Size and other drum 'n' bass artists. Nathan Graves, UK head of jazz for the Universal music group, the US company to which Pine is now signed, says he \"has an extraordinary ear; he's jazz-oriented but his music reflects his taste in not just reggae and rhythm and blues, but hip-hop and drum 'n' bass.\" </p> <p>\"Jazz has always been about fusion,\" says Pine. \"In housing estates you hear reggae, techno, classical; you walk through a flat and hear a random mix. But it becomes harmonious, like mixing cultures to get something different, shocking and stimulating. I'd get home from a jazz gig and play ska, or early 4 Hero, or Goldie. So I made a conscious effort to fuse the two, to inspire myself again.\" </p> <p>The fusion made Modern Day Jazz Stories one of the Mercury music prize albums of the year in 1996, and won Pine a MOBO (music of black origin) for best jazz act two years running. The single of Cassandra Wilson's cover of I've Known Rivers was in the UK charts, and her Don't Explain was on the Kiss FM playlist for 10 weeks. But jazz purists were \"stumped\", he says. \"Guys are the self-proclaimed experts. Women in this country have no need to know the ins and outs of the mechanics; they just like the music, it moves them. But men get all anal about it and try to impress their friends.\" </p> <p>For Adrian Gibson, who runs London's Jazz Cafe in Camden, Pine is \"the only one in England to have made the straight-ahead jazz scene in London sit up to other musics. He went through what Miles Davis did in the 70s, but perceptions have changed. Now people accept you can have a reggae track in the middle of jazz. He's built respect from his audiences by respecting them: he'll bring you into his music, not throw in something that's way too heavy, or bore you with a 25-minute solo.\" </p> <p>With the evolution of Pine's music has come a more relaxed style. \"I used to say, this is the best music in the world, and, being a youngster, I thought wearing a smart suit would say that,\" he smiles. \"But with a hip-hop band, the audience is ready to take part, dressing the way I dress every day. I decided to bring that to jazz.\" </p> <p>Claiming to have spent all his money on \"studio tech\" in his detached house in Harrow, north-west London, Pine is chuffed to be asked how he composes. He writes music, often at the piano, to a title - whether on Stephen Lawrence or Shaka Zulu - \"as though it were prose; then I do edits and improvisation, and put in a reggae bass line. So the composition is a mixture of elements as well as upholding or breaking the rules of the jazz tradition.\" </p> <p>As a youthful elder statesman of British jazz, Pine sees a changing climate for black, college-educated jazz musicians, with more of them \"in positions of power, owning their own bands and radio stations\". Yet he warns of the limits of that change and of a leakage to the US, citing Julie Dexter and Ronny Jordan. \"They're leaving one by one; this generation won't stand for playing pubs for door money.\" His ambition is to set up his own record label, \"but for us, survival is so important. I've clawed my way back from near-bankruptcy; I survive on gigs.\" A fan of computer games for relaxation, he praises the internet as \"another medium to get music out\". </p> <p>He leads by example. \"Sometimes a person's presence is the only influence necessary,\" says the poet Lemn Sissay, who has recorded a new album, Words And Pictures, with the Apollo Sax Quartet. \"Courtney's showed you can be black and British and experimental and successful; you don't have to succumb to American pop, though I'm sure the industry will only allow in a trickle like that.\" </p> <p>An informal \"patron\" to Tomorrow's Warriors, a spinoff from the Jazz Warriors, Pine is also to do workshops with schoolchildren from Hackney, Lambeth and Southwark under the auspices of the London Jazz Festival in November, in line with his British Council-sponsored masterclasses wherever he tours in the world. \"I've been given knowledge by others, and you have to pass it on,\" he reflects. \"If someone's inspired, all well and good. But I don't sit down and do a Malcolm X about being an example; I'm still too much in the gig - and it's hardly even started.\" </p> <p>Back in the Day is out on Blue Thumb on Monday. Bands Apart will be on BBC2 on Thursday October 19 at 11.30pm.
