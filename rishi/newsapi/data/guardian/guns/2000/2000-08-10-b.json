  "<p>Britain has had the world's largest fall in premature deaths from lung cancer thanks to the drive to help smokers give up, according to a study in the British Medical Journal. </p> <p>Lung cancer deaths have halved since 1965, mainly due to a reduction in the number of people who smoke. The findings come when, looking worldwide, deaths from tobacco related illnesses are increasing. </p> <p>Researchers said that Britain should be held up as an example, although they stressed that smoking was still the biggest cause of premature death; half of all smokers would eventually be killed by their habit. </p> <p>However, smokers who stopped, even in middle age, reduced significantly the risk of premature death; and those who stopped before middle age were at little higher risk than non-smokers. </p> <p>The report was written by Sir Richard Doll, a professor emeritus of medicine at Oxford University, who 50 years ago was one of the first to link lung cancer with smoking, and by Sir Richard Peto of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's Oxford unit, who is also an Oxford professor. </p> <p>Prof Doll said: \"Our 1950 study showed that smoking was a cause of most of the lung cancer in Britain at that time, and our new study shows that widespread cessation of smoking has halved the number of lung cancer deaths that would otherwise be occurring in Britain in 2000.\" </p> <p>Annual tobacco sales in real terms fell from \u00a3150bn in 1965 to \u00a380bn in 1995 in the UK, the researchers found. By 1998 the death rate for men aged 35-54 had more than halved to 17.4. </p> <p>But smoking was still the biggest cause of premature death in Britain, with 6m tobacco-related deaths over the past 50 years. And worldwide it is predicted that in the 21st century 1bn will die from smoking. </p> <p>Prof Peto said: \"There are still 10m smokers in Britain, and about 5m will be killed by tobacco if they don't stop. </p> <p>\"Tobacco deaths over the next 50 years will be affected much more by the number of adults who manage to stop than by the number of adolescents who start smoking.\" </p> <p>Clive Bates, the director of the anti-smoking charity Action on Smoking and Health, said: \"The message from this is that no one should ever think it is too late to quit.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette company, admitted last week that it had paid scientists to attend World Health Organisation meetings but said it had done nothing improper to influence the United Nations body. </p> <p>The admission came after a report by the WHO accused tobacco companies of trying to subvert international attempts to control smoking over the past two decades through an \"elaborate, well financed, sophisticated and usually invisible\" campaign.</p>",
  "British and Canadian diplomats in Belgrade gained access for the first time today to four of their citizens held by the Yugoslav army for more than a week in Montenegro. <p>Bob Gordon of Great Britain and Craig Bale of Canada, accompanied by lawyers, visited the detainees - two Britons and two Canadians - at the Belgrade military court, where the detainees have been under preliminary investigation for charges of attempted terrorism.</p> <p>\"They are healthy, they've been well treated and we were able to discuss their detention with them,\" Mr Bale said. \"We are hopeful \u0085 that they will be released as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>The Yugoslav army detained the four last week in Montenegro, near the border with Kosovo, after finding explosives-related material in their car. They have not yet been charged by the Belgrade military court, which is conducting a preliminary investigation to determine whether to formally indict them. </p> <p>During a court hearing yesterday, the two Britons, Adrian Prangnell and John Yore, and the Canadians, Shaun Going, and his nephew, Liam Hall, denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>UN officials in Kosovo, where the four worked, have maintained they were returning from a brief holiday when they were captured. Serb officials, however, disagree.</p> <p>Vojislav Seselj, the Serbian deputy prime minister and head of the ultra-nationalist Radical party, said there was no doubt the four were spies. \"They are obviously spies and saboteurs. They had sabotage equipment with them and an investigation will determine what their aim was,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Whether they came here to carry out a sabotage with explosives, to kill or abduct someone or if their aim was to reach Radovan Karadzic and kidnap him.\"</p> <p>Mr Karadzic is wanted by The Hague's ongoing war-crimes tribunal for war crimes during the Bosnian war.</p> <p>Mr Bale said evidence presented so far at the military court proves that there is no ground for any charges. He added, however, the investigative procedure is continuing \"in accordance with the Yugoslav law\".</p> <p>Djordje Djurisic, the lawyer for the two jailed Britons, has said that it would be at least a week or two before the military prosecutor decides whether to lay charges, but he said he remained optimistic.</p> <p>\"Then the matter will be sent to the military prosecutor. Based on the evidence now, we are hopeful for a successful and positive outcome,\" Mr Djurisic said.</p> <p>Mr Gordon said the two Britons were \"fine and in good health, and are looking forward to receiving some reading material\". Mr Gordon said they had given him messages to relay to their families. If convicted, the four could face up to 15 years in prison.</p> <p>Commenting on the detentions, Nikola Sainovic, a high-ranking Socialist party official and close aide to the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, said the matter was \"very serious indeed.\"</p> <p>\"We take the matter as seriously as any other country would when it discovers foreign nationals - and members of a foreign military - with mine explosive devices to which they admit ownership,\" he said.</p>",

  "Protesters took to the streets throughout the northern Basque region of Spain today, after this week's upsurge in violence by Basque separatists Eta. <p>Crowds outside the town hall in Pamplona hurled abuse at politicians from Euskal Herritarrok - widely considered to be Eta's political wing - as they walked across the square at the start of a five-minute silence to mark yesterday's shooting of an army officer in the city.</p> <p>When police asked to see their identity papers, a scuffle broke out and Juan Kruz Aldasoro, a member of the party's executive committee, was wrestled to the ground and detained.</p> <p>Police would not confirm what, if any, charges Mr Aldasoro would face.</p> <p>Since noon on Tuesday, two car bombs and a shooting have left two people dead and 11 injured. Since ending a 14-month cease-fire in December, Eta has been blamed for nine deaths in around 20 attacks.</p> <p>The Interior Ministry office for the Navarra region, the capital of which is Pamplona, said that Mr Aldasoro and other EH officials had requested permission to hold a demonstration in the area today, but that had been turned down.</p> <p>News agency Efe said that the rally would have been in memory of four suspected Eta members who blew themselves up Monday night as they drove through Bilbao in a car full of explosives.</p> <p>Spanish police said that they were on their way to stage an attack.</p> <p>While the Pamplona protest was taking place, other silent anti-Eta vigils were held in the Basque capital Vitoria and San Sebastian.</p> <p>At the same time, the Spanish met opposition leaders to discuss the upsurge in violence.</p> <p>All officials refused to make any comment as they left the meeting, but it seems likely that politicians will present a united front against the violence.</p> <p>Before this week's violence, Eta had staged nearly a dozen attacks over the previous month, including two political assassinations in July. </p> <p>The group has killed around 800 people since 1968, when it launched its campaign of violence for a Basque state in northern Spain and south west France.</p> <p>Eta maintained a ceasefire for 14 months until last, blaming the government for refusing to discuss its demands for self-rule.</p>",

  "<p>Straight into the college foyer on Monday morning, and I see the first asylum seeker of the week at the reception desk, looking Middle Eastern and tired. \"I need English. English class where?\" Reluctantly I declare myself. \"I teach English. Can I help you?\"</p> <p>The answer is that I can't. We have no more spaces in any of our classes for English as a second language (ESOL) in Newcastle. We have a file bulging with names and addresses of desperate refugees. We are no longer enrolling students, and I should tell him to come back in three months' time when our next sessions start.</p> <p>But I can't face the disappointment in his eyes. So we go upstairs and I ask him to write down his name and address and promise to get in touch if there are any spaces. \"But please you give me class soon,\" he begs. \"I come back again tomorrow.\" </p> <p>\"No, not tomorrow. Wait until we write to you,\" and I mimic the act of writing with an imaginary pencil in the air. </p> <p>\"I at home all day,\" he says. \"Do nothing. Need English. Need class.\"</p> <p>He starts to follow me into the staff-room to plead his case, and colleagues look up wearily. I manage to get rid of him at last, after marking his name with an asterisk and the words \"very keen\".</p> <p>We date all entries and try to offer places on a first-come, first-served basis, but many names have special pleas for clemency attached, and when we trawl the files we try to take these into account. We also have to work out whether to offer several classes to a few students, thereby enabling them to learn English more quickly, or one class a week to many students. We eventually decide to send notes round to all the ESOL staff again, asking them to look at their class lists and see if they can squeeze in a few extras.</p> <p>The week continues in the same pattern, the normal demands of teaching and administration being punctuated by the extra requests of the new arrivals in the corridors.</p> <p>We started our classes and filled them in last September, but huge numbers of asylum seekers began to arrive without warning in the middle of winter. We have laid on as many extra classes as we can without notice, but we are stretched to breaking point, as are other nearby colleges and ESOL centres.</p> <p>We have taken on new staff, thus increasing the overcrowding in our squalid staffroom. We are even busing students twice a day to a nearby campus where new IT facilities are proving a boon to the new refugee students. (Many with a smattering of English and an interest in computing have enrolled on a Start IT course while awaiting the holy grail of ESOL.)</p> <p>Meanwhile our role in the college extends far beyond that of mere teaching. We are worried about the students' living conditions. Some came to us from a hostel where there was no hot water for a week. They smelt so bad that teachers on enrolment duty were gagging as they filled in the forms. Others are suffering from the bad diets forced on them in these hostels, or from the fact that they have been housed out of town, but are not being given their bus fare to attend college. </p> <p>We find ourselves phoning social services to plead for students to be rehoused, as they have been placed in unsuitable accommodation without local consultation. Other teachers are phoning the churches to find out about second-hand clothing and furniture for our students. We have to deal with mental health problems too. Many asylum seekers are traumatised and deeply unhappy. A few are aggressive.</p> <p>We have always taken pride in our ESOL department, seeing ourselves as a happy and successful part of the college, efficiently led by a section leader who is professional and compassionate, and with classes of satisfied and hard-working students. </p> <p>Now we find ourselves exhausted, demoralised and embarrassed at having to turn so many people away. We are haunted by the corridor people, their faces pressed against the glass of our staffroom door. It feels as though we are in a kind of corridor, too, a halfway place between compassion and frustration, and Britain seems to be in a large corridor of its own, not sure whether it is helping asylum seekers or punishing them. </p> <p>One thing seems certain - if we continue to move vast numbers of people around the country to areas of high unemployment without any support systems for them, we are storing up trouble that will explode in a way that lowly further education teachers cannot control.</p> <p>I recently set a class the mundane homework task of designing an information leaflet for public library users. A Kurdish refugee wrote: \"You have to be careful when you choose the book because from those books which you will read, the Iraqi security service will know how do you think. You can find these books are against the Iraqi government but you cannot read them. If you read them, you will go to the prison as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>In a country where we have the luxury of reading the books of our choice, could we not also offer a little more practical help to people from countries where this is not possible?</p> <p>\u0095 Sue Stewart is an ESOL lecturer at Newcastle College, England</p>",
  "When eccentric billionaire Ross Perot founded it in 1992, the Reform Party pledged itself to reform the American political system. <p>But following a bizarre rumpus between party members gathering for their convention in Long Beach, it seems that what is in the greatest need of reform is the party itself.</p> <p>What was intended as a rallying point for the party's presidential bid has turned into high farce with the possibility that, by the end of the week, there will be two Reform Parties, two Reform Party candidates and one big, fat law suit.</p> <p>On one side of the row are supporters of Pat Buchanan - the gung-ho, right-wing former Republican who only joined the party last autumn.</p> <p>In the opposite corner are those who accuse him and his supporters of hijacking the party and turning it from a libertarian crusade into a conservative pressure group that will do nothing to capture the electorate's imagination.</p> <p>The row came to a head on Tuesday afternoon when the national committee split into factions, with each side claiming to represent the party and local police being called to restore order.</p> <p>The Buchanan brigaders claimed victory but the opposition dispute the claim and say they will nominate their own candidate, Iowa physicist John Hagelin, who is also the Natural Law Party's candidate.</p> <p>Buchanan himself was missing from the early fracas although his doughty sister Bay Buchanan was battling on his behalf.</p> <p>When he arrived in Long Beach on Wednesday afternoon he ridiculed his opponents, laughed at their claims that his supporters were \"storm troopers\" and claimed \"we built a party where it didn't exist.\"</p> <p>Over the next few days, the two factions will each be running separate operations to validate the credentials of delegates and each will be claiming to be the true voice of the party.</p> <p>The anti-Buchanan camp claim that his supporters have filed false ballot papers and committed electoral fraud. The party secretary Jim Mangia, who opposes Buchanan, said on local radio: \"I think Pat Buchanan is corrupt and his campaign is corrupt.\"</p> <p>It was over such feuding that the party lost the support of its most famous elected official, Minnesota governor and wrestler, Jesse Ventura</p> <p>Now the party is in danger of becoming a laughing stock with the anti-Buchananites asking the media in to watch what was happening, while the pro-Buchananites wanted their meeting held in secret.</p> <p>As the temperature outside the convention centre climbed towards the nineties, the heat also rose inside the two hotels where the separate camps were meeting to plan their next moves.</p> <p>Yesterday, bemused delegates arriving from across the country were puzzled by the chaos that confronted them, although some clearly found it refreshing after last week's heavily stage-managed and unspontaneous Republican Convention in Philadelphia.</p> <p>The row will be overshadowed when the Democrats start gathering at the weekend for their own convention in Los Angeles, but it may have dealt the Reform Party a blow from which it will be difficult to recover.</p> <p>Polls already polls suggest that, if voters are leaning towards a third party, it will be the Green Party. Its candidate, Ralph Nader, is now achieving 10 per cent ratings in some states and could benefit from libertarian, anti-government voters who may have been put off by this week's unseemly brawling in Long Beach.</p>",
  "Al Gore and George W Bush were out on the stump talking up their respective running mates in the presidential campaign. <p>Gore's prospective vice-president, Joe Lieberman was lauding the redemptive powers of miracles; and Bush's, Dick Cheney, was meeting a Christian organisation. Elsewhere in the United States, Hillary Clinton was helping to hand out Congressional medals to 15 well-deserving cases such as Jesse Jackson, allegedly dangerous car tyres were being recalled, and Elizabeth Taylor was being treated for mild pneumonia. </p> <p>And far away in Huntsville, Texas, early today, a 33-year-old man with the mind of a child of 12 was receiving a lethal injection. Oliver Cruz, who had spent 12 years on death row, said he was sorry for raping and killing a 24-year-old woman and blamed drink and drugs rather than his IQ, which had been tested as low as 63, making him mentally retarded. </p> <p>\"I want to apologise to the family of Kelly Donovan (his victim),\" said the killer who could barely read or write, speaking from the death chamber. \"I'm sorry for what I did to her. I wish they could forgive me for what I did.\" </p> <p>The Huntsville death chamber is the busiest in the United States and has had 227 clients since capital punishment returned to Texas in 1982, 140 of them in the five years since Mr Bush became governor. </p> <p>Thirteen of the 38 states where the death penalty can be imposed do not execute the mentally retarded. Mr Bush's brother Jeb, governor of Florida, will not sign death warrants on such people and an attempt to save the mentally retarded from lethal injections in Texas failed last year in the state legislature. </p> <p>The measure is thought likely to have more chance of passing next year when it comes up again for consideration. \"That's the tragedy of this case,\" said Jeff Pokorak, Cruz's lawyer. The law is going to prevent the execution of people like Cruz in six to eight months so he would be the last retarded person to die under the old law.\" </p> <p>But it would be a mistake to imagine that the streets are teeming with people objecting to this ghoulish cull. Cruz's case would barely have been noticed, if at all, were it not for his mental state. Certainly, the name of 36-year-old Brian Roberson, who stabbed to death an elderly couple in 1986, would not have rated a mention had he not been executed in the same death chamber an hour before Cruz. </p> <p>True, support for the death penalty has ebbed, down to a 19-year low of 66 per cent at the last count. But the subject was just not an issue at last week's Republican Party convention; no-one expects to hear a word about it when the Democrats have theirs in a few days. </p> <p>Both candidates for president are supporters, as are their running mates. President Clinton famously broke off from the campaign trail in 1992 to return to Arkansas, where he was governor, to sign the death warrant on a mentally-impaired man. </p> <p>And Hillary Clinton, who is running for the Senate from New York, might be the only person running for elected office in the western world who is described by her opponents as an extreme left winger and by herself as a supporter of the death penalty.</p>",

  "<p>Have you ever wondered what the real motive is behind supermarket loyalty cards? They are a front for tying you up with the things that you buy. Till records are no longer lists of anonymous purchases, but preferences attached to real, reachable people. </p> <p>One day you will turn on your internet terminal, log onto your customary grocery supplier and will be greeted with a personalised message such as: \"Special offer on Chateau Neuf du Pape.\" The system will have noted your love of red wine at around \u00a37 a bottle and will try to nudge your spending up a notch. </p> <p>When you have negotiated this temptation, you will check your regular, default list and make some amendments as Auntie, who is staying for the weekend, likes that revolting tinned salmon and, as the cat has just been run over, you cancel its food. Otherwise, it's the order as usual. </p> <p>This model, of a supply being tempered by our own behaviour, is already part of some email systems. If you regularly answer email from Jack before anybody else, the system can put Jack at the top of your list every morning. But if a deal falls through with Jack, he will slip down the running order. </p> <p>Soon the same kind of system will help to regulate our viewing behaviour. In a world of multi-channel, pay per view, unscheduled television, every minute you faff about with your remote control is a minute of unsold entertainment. </p> <p>So entertainment sellers will log what we watch and when; football on Monday, cartoons with the kids on Tuesday; pornography when the wife's out at her needlework class on Wednesday; documentaries when the husband is out at darts on Thursday, and so on. You will be reminded of the special two-hour episode of your soap opera to be released at midnight at a special price. </p> <p>These examples of intelligent agents are the simple part of information delivery based on \"data mining\" and behavioural analysis.

But the usual reaction is that we don't need all this help. So many of us are speeding into the future with our back to the engine, analysing where we are going in terms of where we have been, that we are not ready for broadband technology and what it will do. </p> <p>Soon your internet terminal will be an interactive, digital television, a telephone and a search engine but it will undergo a massive qualitative and quantitative shift once freed from conventional telephones. This is when we will need default grocery lists, narrowcasting and supersmart searching software. </p> <p>Conventional supermarkets are limited in what they stock by their space and your trolley pushing patience. But their online services will be virtually unlimited. </p> <p>We will soon forget the constraints of terrestrial television, no longer united by watching the same things at the same time.

  "<b>Why are vigilante groups haranguing suspected paedophiles? </b> <br>Just under two weeks ago, the News of the World published the names and photographs of 49 people it said were child sex offenders living in towns and cities across Britain. Vigilante groups, composed mainly of parents who now believe they have convicted paedophiles living in their area, have taken to noisy protests outside the suspected sex offenders' houses demanding they leave. A protest in Portsmouth has carried on unabated for the last six nights. <p><b>And what have they achieved? </b><br>Two men accused of child sex offences have committed suicide and four innocent families have fled their homes in Portsmouth after gossip and rumour wrongly identified them as harbouring paedophiles. Violence has flared in Plymouth and Whitely, Berkshire, as gangs mob suspected sex offenders. Innocent men mistaken for paedophiles who have been \"named and shamed\" by the News of the World have been targeted in London and Manchester.</p> <p><b>What do the police and others say? </b><br> Police say that the attacks will put more children at risk as they struggle to supervise convicted paedophiles driven underground for fear of their lives. Clergy and politicians, sensing a witch hunt, have called for the vigilante action to stop. Robin Corbett, chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, says he is asking the Home Office to prosecute the News of the World for incitement to public order offences.</p> <p><b>So what was the News of the World thinking of? </b><br>The murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne focused national attention on the threat to children posed by sex offenders, which is where the current saga began. The paper called its campaign For Sarah and claimed that her murder proved that police monitoring of paedophiles was not enough. Every parent had a right to know who the child sex offenders were, it said, and has since dropped the campaign in favour of \"Sarah's Law,\" a version of \"Megan's Law\" in the US, that would give parents access to information about paedophiles on the sex offenders register.</p> <p><b>What is the sex offenders register? </b><br>There are 12,000 people on the sex offenders register, which came into force in 1997. Anyone convicted of any sexual crime must register their names and addresses with the police, and inform them within 14 days if they move. Any offender failing to register can be jailed for up to six months and fined. In addition, police can apply for a community protection order, which lasts for a minimum of five years and can bar an individual from areas frequented by children.</p> <p><b>Who gets told about the movements of sex offenders? </b><br>Head teachers, doctors, youth leaders, sports club managers and others, including landlords, are notified on a confidential basis of the existence of a local sex offender.</p> <p><b>Is it likely that this information would be freely available in Britain? </b><br> In a recent legal ruling, it was declared that it was in society's interests for the offenders to be allowed to live normal, lawful lives. The past week's vigilante action makes it increasingly unlikely the Home Office would support a law that would give life to mob rule. The police maintain that the supervision of sex offenders is designed around public protection. \"If you damage our supervision you damage public protection,\" George Barrow, spokesman for the Association of Chief Officers of Probation, said yesterday.</p> <p><b>What do Sarah Payne's parents think? </b><br> They say \"life should mean life\" for sex offenders and have endorsed the News of the World's actions every step of the way. The girl's mother, Sara, said: \"We think anyone who causes harm to a child in this way must be taken out of the community for life.\"</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.newsoftheworld.com/\">News of the World For Sarah campaign</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.fdle.state.fl.us/sexual_predators/index.asp\" target=\"_new\">Florida paedophile register</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> King lire</strong><br> </p> <p> One of the happier consequences of the euro would be an end to those mathematical acrobatics required before purchasing so much as a Cornetto abroad. At least if we find all those zeros on price tags bewildering we can rely on the banks to convert them correctly. Or can we? </p> <p>George Wistreich relates how his daughter and son-in-law visited an Italian pizzeria and paid the L100,000 bill by credit card. When their Visa statement arrived, they had been charged \u00a3226 - the equivalent of L700,000. When the couple disputed the amount, the bank obtained a copy of the sales slip from the restaurant. It is, according to Wistreich, of poor quality and scarred with blobs and scratches, but recognisably for the sum of L100,000. However, the couple had not kept their receipt and the bank insists that without it, it cannot dispute sums \"altered\" by merchants. The sum wasn't altered, insists Wistreich, just misread. </p> <p> \u0095 \"They're scuppered,\" concludes a spokesman from the Association for Payment Clearing Services (Apacs). \"The Italian bank will have misread the digits. The UK bank wouldn't have seen the sales slip, although it's unfortunate that it won't do more to help.\" </p> <p>Stuart Cliffe of the Association of Bank and Insurance Customers isn't surprised. \"Banks tend to wave their hands in the air and say there is nothing they can do - we say they are responsible for our money so it's up to them to ensure that the right amount is debited,\" he says. </p> <p>Travellers beware: conversion hiccups are by no means rare, but the arrival of the euro has spawned a new scam. Credit card holders pay for goods in, say, lire, but the trader tells the bank the price was in euros, thereby vastly inflating the value. \"Please, please keep receipts so you can back up any complaints,\" the APCS warns. </p> <p><strong> Good things in packages</strong><br> </p> <p> It's that happy time of year when Consumer readers, worn down by malfunctioning computers, recalcitrant insurers and automated help lines, take themselves off to recover. And return, many of them, with more grievances. Jeff Wells, of London, wonders if there is any future in package holidays when it's so easy - and, he found, cheaper - to book holidays direct. After a week with his family in the French resort of Courchevel, he found that he could have saved \u00a3500 had he booked the transport and accommodation himself instead of through First Choice. Since then he has seen a First Choice brochure for 2001 in which a ski package for three, in Courchevel, comes to \u00a32,925. \"I've been offered the same holiday booked direct from Eurostar and the same hotel for \u00a3650 less, including a taxi from the station. Even if we travel first class and choose full board we save \u00a3207 on First Choice's price for economy travel and half board.\" </p> <p> \u0095 First Choice says that the package Wells highlights is not representative. \"It's one of the most expensive hotels we feature,\" says a spokesman, missing the point. \"I don't believe Mr Wells could come close to matching the prices for our Total Ski Package which start at \u00a3309 and include everything from skiing lessons to drinks.\" </p> <p>The Association of British Travel Agents denies hotly that package deals are a rip off. \"You can always find an exception to the rule that they are cheaper because hotels often do last-minute deals if you book direct,\" says a spokeswoman. \"Tour operators block book so get better deals with airlines. Most important, package travellers are covered by the Package Travel Regulations which give some protection when things go wrong.\" </p> <p><strong> BA ticket trauma</strong><br> </p> <p> Michael Bave, of Epping, has learned the value of the Package Travel Regulations the painful way. His son wanted to take the place of a friend on a \u00a3900 flight to Australia. The travel agent, Lunn-Poly, said he would have to deal direct with British Airways which says it is not policy to amend tickets,although the flight is not until December and no tickets have yet been issued. Instead it offered to cancel the old ticket for \u00a3150 and issue a new one at \u00a31,800. \"None of their documents say that the tickets are non-refundable and non-transferrable,\" says Bave. \"Is this fair?\" </p> <p> \u0095 Had Bave's son booked a package to Australia he would have been covered by section 10 (1) of the 1992 Package Travel Regulations which states that a holiday may be transferred if reasonable notice is given and the new traveller meets all the relevant conditions. But this does not apply to independent passengers. </p> <p>\"Although a name change may sound simple it actually involves cancelling the old booking and making a new one,\" says a BA spokeswoman. \"The cheaper the ticket, the more restrictions there are and the travel agent is supposed to make this clear.\"</p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\"> consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Once they were dismal warehouses for bodies in transit with a McDonald's and a sun-cream stand to provide essential maintenance. Now they are transforming themselves into miniature shopping malls with high-street names carefully selected to appeal to the types of passenger who pass through each terminal. </p> <p>If you're killing time in Heathrow's Terminal Three, for example, you are likely to be American or Japanese and wealthy enough to pad out your suitcase at Gucci, Chanel and Holland &amp; Holland, all of whom are making their first foray into airport retailing this year. At Terminal Four, you are a rich Russian who requires a Pret a Manger wrap and perhaps a leather hippopotamus from Liberty. Judging from the window shoppers at Gatwick's South Terminal, you are a thin, bronzed, blonde twenty-something en route to Ibiza and tempted to rethink your clubwear at Warehouse, Hugo Boss and French Connection, newly opened this year. </p> <p>Yes, mountainous middle-aged flesh still slumbers across three seats in the Gatwick waiting area; youths in Bermudas still masticate in McDonald's and fractious mothers still steer fractious children on top of luggage trolleys through the peak-season crush, but across the shop thresholds, where the airport floor tiles give way to woodstrip and chrome, is a world far removed from the traditional squalor of tourist lounges. Need a pair of beach sandals? Try Kurt Geiger, Bally, Timberland or the brand-new Nike store. If the person on the next seat has better three-quarter-length trousers than you, simply dash in to Next before your flight is called. </p> <p>It was the demise of duty free in the European Union that encouraged this retail revolution. \"Everyone thought that meant an end to tax-free shopping, which it doesn't. Duty was only payable on alcohol and tobacco,\" says a spokeswoman for the British Airports Authority (BAA), which runs most of the country's principal airports. Fearful of plummeting revenues (sales of alcohol and tobacco have fallen by up to a third in the last year), BAA decided that a new bait was needed, and an increase of youthful travellers, attracted by the new low-cost airlines, made fashion the obvious remedy. Other names in the frame, according to fashion industry bible Drapers Record are DKNY, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Paul Smith. By 2001 BAA aims to have increased its retail space by 160,000 sq ft nationwide. </p> <p>Detailed market research was undertaken to target the different types of travellers in the various airports and, although BAA is reluctant to discuss how it vets its retailers, it is known to be tough on brands that don't meet their sales targets. The high-street names who passed muster, many of whom have never ventured into airports before, have been only too delighted to accept. \"At Heathrow you're talking between 10,000 and 15,000 people passing through on each day, depending on the terminal, and at Gatwick around 35,000,\" says Mark Jones, retail speciality manager at Timberland, which has recently opened a branch in Gatwick South Terminal. \"We tend to stock the 20 best-selling lines and, at Gatwick, for instance, we concentrate on seasonal merchandise, such as sandals, shorts and T-shirts.\" </p> <p>For the retailers, the allure is a captive clientele, with time to kill and a pre-holiday lack of inhibitions. For the consumer it's the prices, which are around 15% lower than in the high street. Buy a couple of jackets from Chanel and you'll have recouped your economy fare in the sum you save. </p> <p>Moreover, most of the shops use their airport outlets to try out new ranges before launching them in the high street, so that your ticket to Marbella can also buy you exclusivity. French Connection came up with T-shirts bearing the legends \"Flying FCUK\" and \"Mile-high FCUK\" for its Gatwick branch, although these have now found their way out into the real world. Nike is currently previewing a range of swimwear and football shirts and Warehouse has been doing good business with floating silk trousers which would be unlikely to sell on a wet summer's day in Oxford Street. </p> <p>The snootier shops such as Gucci and Chanel are still coming to terms with the leap from Bond Street to Heathrow. No doubt fearful for their exclusive image, they are coy about discussing their new branches. Nor do they want to be lumped in with the likes of Dixons and Accessorize, so airports are creating enclaves of like-minded retailers within the shopping areas. At Heathrow, for instance, Caviar House Seafood Bar sits alongside Holland &amp; Holland, while TGI Friday fuels those who prefer Tie Rack. </p> <p>In a canny strategy to ensure that no opportunity is missed, BAA has now launched a free personal shopper service at Heathrow and Gatwick. \"If you're a businessman who wants a present for your wife or you're flying off to a wedding and need a gift, the shopper will guide you round the best buys, or, if you prefer to sit it out with a gin, do it all for you,\" says a spokeswoman. \"Last week a personal shopper bought a \u00a37,000 Rolex watch on behalf of a traveller and delivered it to the departure gate. They'll also dash to another terminal if a passenger wants something from a shop there.\" </p> <p>Alternatively, if you should fall for that leather hippo in Liberty or a wide-screen television set in Dixons, do not worry about whether it will fit in the overhead luggage rack. Instead, you can pay for it before you fly off on your holiday and collect it on your return. Another new concept is a general-purpose shop just before the arrivals lounge where passengers can buy last-minute gifts tax-free. </p> <p>At Stansted airport, plans have been laid for a huge new shopping area and its interior has been refitted with leather and chrome seating and hip rubber flooring to attract the loftier brand names. Manchester, one of the few UK airports not operated by BAA, has similar ambitions but is restricted by space. \"We're working hard to counter losses from duty-free sales and looking to attract niche operators, and duty-free operators are considering enticing brands to give them a more department store feel,\" says a spokesman. Vittorio, an Italian specialist in silk blouses and ties, has opened its second UK shop there and the airport managers have been in talks with Gap and Hanro. </p> <p>Alas, things are different for travellers in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Edinburgh has acquired a Jenners and an Austin Reed in the check-in area, but the departure lounges are unlikely to receive the same kind of overhaul. \"There simply isn't the volume of people passing through to make it worthwhile,\" says BAA. </p> <p>Back at Gatwick South Terminal, two teenagers with boarding passes for Ibiza are trying on transparent pink mules at Kurt Geiger as though it were a Saturday afternoon in the high street. Across the way, a new Italian restaurant, Est Est Est, does its best to resemble London's hipper bars, with chrome, woodstrip and mood lighting. And if such rampant consumerism should take its toll, there is Clarins beauty salon, which offers pre-booked massages to send travellers serenely on their way. The MetroCentre and Bluewater should take note. At this rate airports could be the shopping malls of the future - with a flight to the Med thrown in.</p>",
  "<p>Governments all over the world have suddenly become embroiled in controversy about electronic surveillance of the internet. In the United States, a political storm has arisen over a new FBI internet tapping system codenamed Carnivore. In Britain, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act has just extended telephone-tapping powers to cover internet service providers (ISPs), and allows the government to arrange indiscriminate tapping or email interception for foreign police forces and security agencies. </p> <p>In the Netherlands, the Dutch security service BVD admitted two weeks ago that it has been collecting emails sent abroad by companies. In the Hague, laws are being prepared to allow the Justice Ministry to tap into email and subscriber records, scan messages and mobile phone calls, and track users' movements. </p> <p>The Australian government has passed laws allowing security agents to attack and modify computers secretly to obtain information. Many other governments have similar schemes in the pipeline. </p> <p>These developments are no coincidence but the direct result of secret planning over seven years by an international co-ordinating group set up by the FBI, after Congress twice refused to extend its telephone tapping powers for digital networks. Under the innocuous title of the International Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar (ILETS), the group has met annually to plan for and lobby to make telecommunications systems \"interception-friendly\". </p> <p>ILETS excluded lawyers and industry specialists who might have advised on the arrangements to protect privacy and human rights, or on the feasi bility and cost of the intelligence officers' wish list of interception requirements. As a result, the laws based on their recommendations have repeatedly caused controversy. </p> <p>The work of ILETS first came to light in late 1997, when a British researcher, Tony Bunyan, revealed collaboration between EU staff and the FBI for many years. Details of plans to compel ISPs all over the world to install secret internet interception \"black boxes\" in their premises appeared in <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3859496,00.html\">Online</a> last year. </p> <p> A month ago, the European Parliament appointed 36 MEPs to lead a year-long investigation into Echelon - the codename for a mainly US system for monitoring traffic on commercial communications satellites. Echelon has become common parlance for the worldwide electronic eavesdropping or signals intelligence (Sigint) network run by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) together with the US National Security Agency (NSA). The inquiry will ask if the rights of European citizens are adequately protected and ascertain whether European industry is put at risk by the global interception of communications. </p> <p>French politicians and lawyers have taken the lead in accusing the US and Britain of using their electronic intelligence networks to win business away from foreign rivals. US politicians have riposted that France runs a worldwide electronic intelligence system of its own - \"Frenchelon\", based at Domme, near Sarlat in the Dordogne, and includes an eavesdropping station in New Caledonia in the Pacific (see <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/ 2000/25/ns-16207.html\">www.zdnet.co.uk/news/ 2000/25/ns-16207.html</a>). </p> <p>Electronic eavesdropping has become a battleground between the US and Russia. The Russian-American Trust and Cooperation Act of 2000, passed on July 19, stops President Clinton rescheduling or writing off billions of dollars of Russian debts unless a Russian spy base in Cuba is \"permanently closed\". </p> <p>This base at Lourdes, located on leased land near Havana, was the former Soviet Union's most important intelligence facility. It uses Echelon-type systems to collect data from telephone calls and satellite links covering the US. </p> <p>Lourdes allegedly provides \"between 60% and 70% of all Russian intelligence data about the US\". A defector has said that spying from Lourdes has grown dramatically following an order by Boris Yeltsin to step up economic and technological espionage against the west. </p> <p>The White House wants to stop the campaign to close Lourdes because other countries might then ask the US to close down its identical bases. Documents suggest the US would particularly fear the Lourdes effect spreading to Britain, Germany and Australia, where the NSA operates large sites. Its station at Menwith Hill, Yorkshire, is the largest electronic intelligence base in the world. </p> <p>The US is not alone in this spying. By the end of the year, the Government Technical Assistance Centre (GTAC) will have begun operations from inside MI5's headquarters at Thames House, Millbank. Its primary purpose will be to break codes used for private email or to protect files on personal computers. It will also receive and hold private keys to codes which British computer users may be compelled to give to the government, under the RIP Act. </p> <p>Development of GTAC has been pioneered by the Home Office's Encryption Co-ordination Unit, which says that the centre will \"provide the capability to produce plain text/images/audio from lawfully intercepted communications and lawfully seized computer media which are encrypted\". The Home Office has not confirmed reports that GTAC will also be the collecting point for intercepted internet communications relayed from the \"sniffer\" boxes to be installed inside British ISPs. </p> <p>The cost of building GTAC, said to be \u00a325m, is likely to include the price of ultra-fast super-computers, of the type previously used only to break Soviet codes and attack other special military targets. Code breakers from the communications intelligence agency GCHQ will be seconded to work at GTAC. </p> <p>GCHQ has used sophisticated computers for many years to examine foreign or \"external\" messages and phone calls, as part of the worldwide intelligence network operated with other English-speaking countries. The key part of this system utilises computers called Dictionaries, which hold lists of thousands of target names, addresses and key words. They are used to select messages of interest, while discarding the majority of communications. </p> <p>GCHQ was not normally permitted to encroach on domestic communications. Now the RIP Act says that as many domestic internet communications travel on the same \"trunks\" as external communications, GCHQ will be allowed to trawl through these messages without restriction. </p> <p>Another limitation, which had prevented the direct targeting of people in Britain by GCHQ without specific authorisation has also been dropped. The Home Secretary has been given powers under Section 16 (3) of the Act to sign an \"overriding\" warrant every three months. This will allow general surveillance without the need for individual warrants. </p> <p>This will apply to \"serious crime\", which can include organising demonstrations that may affect public order. The government has offered no justification for its willingness to allow GCHQ to intrude on domestic political and policing matters. The RIP act will also allow any agency nominated by the Home Secretary to tap into the addresses of emails sent and received (though not their content) without a warrant. </p> <p> Caspar Bowden, whose lobbying organisation, the <a href=\"http://www.fipr.org\">Foundation for Information Policy Research</a>, FIPR, helped to bring some important changes to the RIP Act, believes that letting Dictionary type computers carry out broad-ranging surveillance on much internal UK traffic will break the new Human Rights Act. </p> <p>The FBI has just been granted funds for an $85m electronic surveillance programme called Digital Storm. This foresees the quadrupling of telephone tapping in the US over the next decade, because of the convenience of digital processing and the automated delivery of intercepted messages and conversations to FBI agents. </p> <p>The FBI hopes to build in automated transcription and translation systems. According to its budget application for the next US fiscal year, a related programme called Casa de Web will include central computer archives for intercepted audio and data reports. It will also provide \"analytic tools for automated speaker identification, text key word spotting, and voice key word spotting\". </p> <p>The existence of Carnivore, the FBI tapping system, was revealed three months ago as the result of a lawsuit between a US ISP and federal marshals, who demanded that the ISP wire a Carnivore box into its network. The FBI initially wanted to install its own version of a commercial \"sniffer\" programme called Etherpeek. Then it turned up with Carnivore and a court order to install it. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/programs/carnivore/carnivore.htm\">The FBI</a> claims there are only 20 Carnivores, and that they have been used only 25 times in the last 18 month. But the system is so controversial that the US Congress held special hearings two weeks ago. A judge has ordered the FBI to answer requests for details made under the Freedom of Information Act. </p> <p>Carnivore consists of a laptop computer and communications interface cards. It runs a packet sniffer programme to select the data it wants from inside the ISP local network. According to Marcus Thomas, head of the FBI's Cyber Technology Section, they are PCs using proprietary software and acting as a \"specialized sniffer\". </p> <p>The bureau claims that although Carnivore's hardware sees all the traffic passing through the ISP where it is installed, its software looks only at the origin and the destination of each internet packet. If the addresses correspond with those specifically authorised in a court order, then the information and/or the contents are extracted and forwarded to the FBI. The agency claims no other data is recorded or examined. </p> <p>But US computer experts do not believe this is possible. For example, many ISPs dynamically allocate internet addresses to their customers. This means that every time you dial in to your ISP, you will use a different internet address. Unless Carnivore is also intercepting this type of data, it cannot work. </p> <p>The experts have asked the FBI to reveal the source code of Carnivore. The FBI has refused, but says it will arrange a \"privacy audit\". US Attorney General Janet Reno has publicly regretted the woodenheaded selection of the codename Carnivore. She says it will soon be changed to a less threatening name. </p> <p> Despite the power of systems such as Echelon or Carnivore, they face many practical difficulties in conducting the type of extensive surveillance that some people fear. </p> <p>The risk they pose to civil liberties has often been questioned because of the simple techniques that criminals or terrorists can use to outrun surveillance. </p> <p>Setting up new internet accounts and email addresses to use for a few days or weeks takes barely a minute to do, yet can limit or defeat law enforcement or intelligence targeting. </p> <p>For the ordinary computer user who wants their email and web surfing activities to regain at least the same level of privacy enjoyed by ordinary letters, the best and probably the only tool to use is a system called Freedom. </p> <p>Pioneered by the Canadian-based Zero Knowledge company, Freedom uses multiple encrypted links to carry every kind of internet traffic. The first step is a secure connection to a local ISP running a Freedom server. Several are now operating in Britain. Your message, re-encrypted each time it travels, is passed among one or more Freedom servers before being inserted onto the internet at a distant location. The system used means that no one, including Zero Knowledge itself and the ISPs you use, knows what messages are being sent or who is sending them. </p> <p>For those less worried about intelligence agencies but infuriated by the privacy-destroying habits of some websites and internet companies, the American-based Junkbusters group offers an excellent free tool which stops unwarranted data collection and also limits the time-wasting effects of downloading of advertising material. </p> <p> Systems like Carnivore and the black boxes, which MI5 and the police want to install soon in British ISPs, are based on internet technologies used every day by network managers and trouble-shooters. </p> <p>Packet sniffers utilise the fact that all the traffic being handled by an ISP will travel on one or more very high-speed data links. These typically handle hundreds or even thousands of megabits of data every second. </p> <p>Everyone's data travels on these shared links, in the form of datagrams, or packets of data. Each packet contains details of the sender and the intended destination of the data packet. In principle, this information can be used to select only the data being sent to or received by the target of a government approved warrant. </p> <p>But the ISP has no way of knowing how much data is being extracted from their clients' private messages. It all depends on how the software is programmed, and this is kept secret. </p> <p>One program used by the FBI to tap email is Etherpeek, which can be programmed to select any type of data from an internet data stream. Its manufacturers say it can \"capture all conversations on a network segment, much like a tele phone tap\". It costs less than $1,000 to buy and may be the proprietary software used for Carnivore. </p> <p>Another commercial packet sniffer modified for internet surveillance is WireSpeed, which can analyse more than 300 different network types. The WireSpeed analyser, developed by a US corporation, Radcom, was recommended for use in a recent Home Office report, which noted that it was \"a major component of another country' s interception solution - it would enable the user to view the content portion(s) of electronic messages\". </p> <p>Industry and civil liberties critics in Britain and the US say that packet-sniffing technology is so powerful and undetectable, that it poses a threat to civil liberties and privacy that could not have existedpreviously. As even the ISP to whose equipment it is connected will not know what it is doing, there can be no means of verifying that surveillance is being limited to what is legally allowed. </p> <p> <strong> Links</strong> </p> <p><strong> Freedom internet privacy protection system </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.zeroknowledge.com\">www.zeroknowledge.com</a><br> <strong> Junkbuster</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/ijb.html\">www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/ijb.html</a> <br> <strong> WireSpeed Internet Analyser </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.radcom-inc.com/products/wire-spec.htm\">www.radcom-inc.com/products/wire-spec.htm</a> <br> <strong>Etherpeek packet sniffer </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.aggroup.com/products/etherpeek\">www.aggroup.com/products/etherpeek </a> </p> <p>\u0095 Duncan Campbell is a freelance investigative journalist and not the Guardian's Los Angeles correspondent of the same name.</p>",
  "<p>If you're considering pitching a project to <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Spielberg,+Steven\">Steven Spielberg</a>, you may be in for a very long wait. The Oscar-winning director has just signed on to direct the Columbia production Big Fish - which isn't even due to start shooting until summer next year. Before that he faces the little matter of directing both A.I. and Minority Report. After taking an eighteen month break from film-making following Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg appears desperate to make up for lost time.</p> <p>Big Fish is scripted by Go writer <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?August,+John\">John August</a>, from the novel Big Fish: A Tale of Mythic Proportions by Daniel Wallace. According to the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/\">Hollywood Reporter</a>, the film will be produced by Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen, the team behind American Beauty and backed by Columbia, though Spielberg's company DreamWorks may yet have a hand in the financing. </p> <p>At first glance the film heralds a return to the focus on family life that Spielberg demonstrated in pictures such as ET and Close Encounters. The book tells the tale of a show-off, yarn-spinning businessman called Edward Bloom and his estranged son William. When Edward is discovered to be dying of cancer, William attempts to cut through the web of myth, exaggeration and outright falsehoods that his father has woven around himself and discover the real man beneath. The story plays out in flashback, and functions as a wry pastiche of the Mark Twain or Uncle Remus style of early American tall-tales. Casting has yet to be announced.</p>",
  "<p> 'It's all painful\", sighed Lars von Trier. \"Painful, and crazy\", he added, then buried his unshaven face in his hands. This interview wasn't turning out as I'd hoped. With a TV crew in tow, I had journeyed to wonderful Copenhagen, my mission being to investigate Trier's celebrated Dogme 95 movement. But today the maestro was mired in difficulties with his Bj\u00f6rk musical Dancer In The Dark. He seemed out of sorts, and almost dismissive of the avant-garde he'd started. Yet, when he wrenched his hands from his face, he was all dimpled smiles again. Not for the first time, I wondered if the joke was on me. </p> <p>How did I get here? In May 1999 Faber and Faber had commissioned me to make a book-length study of Trier's Danish nouvelle vague . Shortly thereafter my friends Paula Jalfon and Colin MacCabe of Minerva Pictures suggested we make a companion documentary. Like many movie goers, I had been tickled by Trier's resolution to make simpler, more truthful films under a 10-point \"vow of chastity\". I'd admired the brass neck of Trier's youthful accomplice Thomas Vinterberg in explaining their strategy (\"We asked ourselves what we most hated about film today, then we drew up a list banning it all.\") And surely it was time somebody in European cinema revolted against the boring mediocrity of the Hollywood mainstream. But after the cheers and jeers for Vinterberg's Festen and Trier's The Idiots, I was being asked to hammer out the truth from the lies in this strange case. Was Dogme 95 more than just a twisted Scandinavian prank? </p> <p>The weirdness of film schedules meant that we began our investigation of this Danish phenomenon by hunting down a Frenchman in Midwest America. Jean-Marc Barr, director of the first non-Danish Dogme film, Lovers, was shooting his follow-up in the Illinois corn-belt, using digital video cameras no bigger than a man's fist. Our director Saul Metzstein was delighted to find that our DVC kit (the Sony PD100AP) was a fancier model than Barr's. But Jean-Marc was so sweet and passionate about the freedoms of working Dogme-style that he inspired us to try to emulate Trier's rules in our doc. So we solemnly swore: no lights, no props, no tripod, no superimposed titles, and no director's credit for Saul. We even improvised a few additional vows: I swore to wear at all times a bobble-hat bearing the legend \"Newcastle - Toon Army\" to prevent anybody taking me seriously. </p> <p>At last, in November 1999, we breached Denmark and travelled through the wooded outskirts of Copenhagen to Film City: formerly a military installation, now HQ of Dogme 95 operations. Trier's business partner Peter Aalbaek Jensen regaled us in his trophy-lined office, boasting of how he runs their company in a system of guerrilla \"cells\" impervious to CIA infiltration. \"Lars and I are old left-wingers,\" he grinned, \"and we wanted to use some of the precious skills that we learned in our communist youth.\" That night, our pulses raced as we met Thomas Vinterberg - prettier than most actors (though Saul's camera strove to find flaws in his physiognomy). </p> <p>Thomas was happy to explode the cabal-like myth of the Dogme Brotherhood: \"Really, we don't work that well together. We have a nice time, we drink a lot and yell at each other. But it just takes too long to decide anything.\" And Soren Kragh-Jacobsen (director of Dogme#3: Mifune) was refreshingly frank about the mounting critical disdain for the movement: \"It's the nature of man. You love something for nine months, then you start to talk shit about it.\" </p> <p>Sampling Copenhagen's nightlife, we had a fortuitous encounter with Porno-Lasse, Denmark's premier sexual performer, who loaned his skills for the infamous gangbang sequence in The Idiots. Alas, his contribution ended up on Trier's cutting-room floor; and we were unable to make room for him in our film either. Then again, Lasse fills more space than the average male. </p> <p>The next morning, we had our oddball audience with Trier. His cluttered office betrayed the trademark obsessions of a famous cineaste: rowing machine on the deck, scripts and DVDs (The Blair Witch Project) on the desk, and a framed portrait of Robert Baden-Powell. \"Any reason?\" I had to ask. \"Well, he's the man behind it all, isn't he?\" chuckled Lars. \"Old pervert...\" I should have headed for the long grass then. But once Lars laid off the leg-pulling, he was impressively thoughtful, comparing the D95 manifesto to certain buildings by Albert Speer, constructed with softer stones in strategic spots so as to crumble more elegantly into ruin. </p> <p>At those rare lucid moments, my respect for Dogme soared, as I think Saul's documentary conveys. Not a single person on screen seems to take anything seriously - except their work. And though Dogme is a game, it's played in deadly earnest: mock-solemn, but 100 per cent idealistic. This truth was evinced by our final witness, the anarchic Harmony Korine, director of US Dogme#1: Julien Donkey-Boy. </p> <p>\"I know I wouldn't be interested in Dogme if there was any irony attached to the vow of chastity\", asserted Harmony in his New York office. \"It's a very serious thing...\" </p> <p>He then spoiled the effect somewhat, by giggling. But as veteran students of the Dogme game, we chose to take his word. </p> <p>\u0095 The Name Of This Film Is Dogme 95, Saturday, 11.40pm, Channel 4</p>",
  "A 33-year-old killer with the mental capacity of a child not yet into his teens was executed early today in the state governed by George W Bush, the candidate most likely to be the next president of the United States. <p>Oliver Cruz, who tested as mentally disabled and could barely read or write, was given a lethal injection in the country's busiest death chamber. </p> <p>Cruz, who had been on death row for 12 years for the rape and murder of a 24-year-old woman, had said: \"I made a mistake. I don't blame nobody. I take full responsibility. There's nothing I could do or say to bring the person back. There's nothing I could do or say to her family about how sorry I am.\" </p> <p>Cruz was one half of a double execution in Huntsville, Texas. The second man was Brian Roberson, 36, who stabbed to death an elderly couple in 1986. </p> <p>Smiling from the execution chamber yesterday, he lashed out at family members and police officers who testified against him at his trial. \"You ain't got what you want,\" he said. </p> <p>Before yesterday there had been 225 executions in the state since the death penalty was restored there in 1982; 140 since Mr Bush became governor five years ago. </p> <p>The power to use capital punishment exists in 38 of the 50 US states, but the execution of mentally disabled people is barred in 13 of these. A bill aimed at introducing a ban in Texas was voted down last year. </p> <p>It is thought that the measure has a good chance of success when it comes up for consideration again next year. \"That's the tragedy of this case,\" said Jeff Pokorak, Cruz's lawyer. </p> <p>\"The law is going to prevent the execution of people like Cruz in six to eight months, so he would be the last retarded person to die under the old law.\" </p> <p>The supreme court voted 6-3 to reject Cruz's request for a reprieve and an appeal. The Texas board of pardons and parole had earlier denied Cruz clemency by a margin of 18-0. </p> <p>Mr Bush had the right to grant Cruz a 30-day reprieve but, as he was out of the state, the responsibility passed to Rick Perry, the lieutenant-governor of Texas. </p> <p>Cruz, who blamed his crime on alcohol and the drugs he had been abusing since the age of 13, had received support from the American Bar Association, the European Union and government officials in Sweden and France. </p> <p>But his case failed to stimulate the interest in Texas that accompanied the execution two months ago of Gary Graham, who claimed until the end that he was innocent. Hundreds of campaigners protested against his execution outside the Huntsville jail. </p> <p>The Cruz case is unlikely to make even the slightest impact on the presidential election campaign, despite any irony implicit in Mr Bush's championing of \"compassionate conservatism.\"</p> <p>Sixty-six per cent of Americans support the death penalty - including Mr Bush, his opponent Al Gore and both their running mates.</p>",
  "When General Pinochet despatched General Aurellano Starck in October 1973 on the operation that became known as the Caravan of Death, he cannot have imagined that the orders he gave would come back to haunt him more than a quarter of a century later. No doubt it seemed at the time like a routine operation to eliminate some potential opponents of the dictatorship. <p>General Starck left Santiago by helicopter on September 30, heading first south, then turning towards the copper-rich north of the country. Everywhere Starck's helicopter landed, prisoners were taken out and murdered - four in Cauquenes, 12 in Valdivia, 15 in La Serena - until the final stop in Calama on October 19, where 26 political prisoners were killed. The Caravan had lasted 19 days. In total, 72 prisoners were dead. </p> <p>The episode was not the biggest in a series of death-dealing events initiated after that year's coup of September 11. But it has proved to be the one that has opened a crack in General Pinochet's immunity large enough for the astute and determined judge Juan Guzman to drive in a wedge. Guzman's case rests on a series of arguments that the Chilean Supreme Court has now not only accepted but reinforced. This week's decision is an important step forward in the painful process of putting Chile's legal system to rights after the systematic distortion of justice that took place under Pinochet's dictatorship. </p> <p>The first hurdle that Guzman had to overcome was the amnesty law that Pinochet had passed to insure himself and others against the possibility of ever facing justice. Decree law 2191, personally drafted by the then justice minister, Monica Madariaga, a relative of Pinochet's, was published on April 19 1978. It exculpates from criminal responsibility anyone who committed crimes, was an accomplice in crimes or covered up crimes between the day of the coup and March 10 1978. It is still in force. </p> <p>The list of crimes that the amnesty law pardons offers an illuminating glimpse of the methods employed by Pinochet's security forces: falsification and cheque swindles, for instance, are pardoned, along with all crimes committed by public employees through the exercise of their office, except for fraud. Homicide and physical injury are pardoned along with property damage, abortion, the abandonment of minors and, curiously, bigamy. </p> <p>Technically, the law applied to crimes committed by the regime's opponents as well as its servants and its stated purpose was to reunite a divided nation. Some 69 political prisoners were released under its provisions, but the impression of even-handedness was a fig leaf. Most of the beneficiaries were the members of the security services who had committed crimes against humanity. Such few human rights cases as had been accepted by the criminal courts were promptly handed over to the military system of justice - a network greatly expanded by Pinochet for the purpose - where the amnesty law was applied wholesale. </p> <p>The law was challenged, though, in 1986, when Ana Luisa Gonzalez filed a criminal suit for the premeditated abduction and homicide of her son, 17-year-old Jose Gregorio Saavedra Gonzalez. Jose had been president of his high school student body association and was in prison in Calama on October 19 1973, when General Starck's helicopter touched down. </p> <p> General Starck was an enthusiast for the coup - in fact, he persuaded an initially reluctant General Pinochet to lend it his support. He was an ideal man, therefore, to entrust with the Caravan of Death and had no scruples about ordering the 17-year-old to be murdered, along with 25 others. Like the families of 18 other victims of the Caravan of Death, Jose's family has never recovered his remains. </p> <p>Mrs Gonzalez argued in 1986 that the crime of abduction is expressly excluded from the amnesty law because, until the victim or his remains are found, the crime is ongoing. The military courts promptly claimed jurisdiction and applied the amnesty law. Mrs Gonzalez had not achieved justice, but the principle she had argued survived and has been used by Judge Guzman as a key element in his strategy. </p> <p>Judge Guzman's second stroke of luck was a matter of evidence. Like other mass murderers before him, Pinochet has not left a paper trail linking himself to his crimes. No written orders have come to light from Pinochet to his subordinates ordering them to carry out arbitrary detentions, torture and killings. But the events of the Caravan of Death do provide a direct link. </p> <p>The 72 victims who fell on each stop of General Starck's helicopter convoy were largely connected with the copper mines - trade unionists, mine workers, engineers, mine managers. Many had reported voluntarily to the military bases when they were called in after the coup to be relieved of their jobs, only to find themselves imprisoned. Chile's armed forces, it is easy to forget, were at the time seen as less prone to the overthrow of democracy than many others in Latin America. It had been a matter of some pride in Chile that democracy had deeper roots than elsewhere on the continent. It was a matter of pride, too, to many of the officers. </p> <p>So when General Starck arrived and ordered that prisoners be shot without trial, he occasionally encountered some resistance from constitutionally minded officers in charge of the jails. They demanded to know on whose orders such atrocities were to be committed. General Starck answered that he had the authority of the supreme commander, no less - thus supplying Judge Guzman with a vital link in the chain of evidence. </p> <p>Pinochet's next defence, his immunity as a self-appointed senator-for-life, was perhaps the gravest insult to Chile's still partial return to democracy, however much Chile's elected representatives might struggle to live with this stroke of realpolitik. Whatever the final outcome of Judge Guzman's case, the supreme court, by a majority of 14 to six, has restored both dignity and credibility to Chilean democracy and for that alone must be applauded. </p> <p>It remains to be seen how many heads of the Pinochet hydra still have life in them. It is still open for a military court to claim the case, but since the supreme court has ruled that the amnesty law does not apply, that option is neither as quick nor as convenient as it used to be.</p> <p> The head of the armed forces has been quick to express his support for Pinochet, but otherwise there is little the military is able - or is prepared - to do to affect the judicial process. The case will take its course. The mental health of the general must now be examined, though his family are presently refusing to permit what they term an \"indignity\". To that, Judge Guzman replies that nobody is above the law. Until this week in Chile, that principle was more dishonoured than respected. Today, at least it has a chance.</p>",
  "<p>Adrian Aymes's renown in these parts stems largely from a post-match grooming ritual that would make Yves St Laurent seem the epitome of slobbishness. There is also a growing feeling that he is the one Hampshire batsman who can be relied on to do something other than sell his wicket for a song. Conviction hardened yesterday on the second day of this First Division match. </p> <p>A glance at the visitors' attack was sufficient to infuse even the most sceptical Hampshire followers with a modicum of expectation. In place of Anil Kumble, Phil DeFreitas, Chris Lewis and James Ormond, all laid low by one malady or another, loomed the combined might of Jon Dakin, Scott Boswell, Carl Crowe and Dominic Williamson, collectively responsible for 111 first-class victims at 38.90 and only 14 this summer. Given a season-long funk yielding one batting point per game, they ought to have known better. </p> <p>Boswell and Dakin, who shared the new ball, would make a spiffing pair of All Black locks, and the home batsmen appeared suitably intimidated. Dakin, a fitful presence despite leading the national batting averages for much of the term, responded admirably to responsibility. Generating plenty of zip, he ejected both openers in his first four overs, inducing Giles White to chop on, then pinning Derek Kenway. </p> <p>Boswell joined in the fun, hitting Will Kendall's off-stump and having Jason Laney taken at slip by the diving Vince Wells. Williamson sentenced Robin Smith to an identical fate, defeating a forward defensive that would not have been out of place in a coaching manual, provided the ball was Tippexed out. </p> <p>At 72 for five, the follow-on still 44 runs distant, Hampshire appeared to be up a creek, even more so when Boswell struck Aymes a painful blow on the right hand - vexing indeed with the NatWest semi-final three days away. </p> <p>At last, though, came signs of resistance. Emboldened by last week's maiden century, Dmitri Mascarenhas launched a series of audacious biffs that reflected his Asian roots as the sixth-wicket pair added 52. Regrettably, prudence eluded him as he drove over a full-length offering from Wells. </p> <p>When John Stephenson skied an off-break from Crowe to extra cover, Aymes' disgust could be imagined, though the fates had been kind to him: on 29 a sharp chance in Crowe's first over escaped short leg. Shaun Udal proved an able accomplice before Boswell went round the wicket and drew an immediate edge to Neil Burns. The advent of Alex Morris, however, heralded the day's most substantial alliance. </p> <p>In his first such outing since shin problems flared in May, Morris had occasionally reminded onlookers why he has been touted as a Test seamer. Now he emphasised that he is no mug with the bat. </p> <p>After nearly 3 hours of grit and graft it took something special to unglue Aymes, Burns changing direction to clasp an inside edge. Aymes, who had made 71, punched his bat in frustration; that he resisted the urge to do likewise to his purported superiors says much for his self-control.</p>",
  "When she was eight years old, like Sarah Payne, my daughter was raped, buggered, and strangled till she lost consciousness. Unlike Sarah, she survived and the man was arrested the same day, but it is just chance that she lived and Sarah died. <p>The man lived over 10 miles away - he'd come on a bus - so even if there had been community notification of paedophiles, we wouldn't have known of him (Vigilante target kills himself, August 9). Even if there had been general access to a list of paedophiles we still wouldn't have known of him - he'd never done it before. He must subsequently have been placed on a list of paedophiles, but this couldn't have helped anybody: I heard he committed suicide while in prison for the offence. I'm not even convinced he was a paedophile: he was married with two children, was depressed (he had had to be talked down from a roof from which he was threatening to jump shortly before), and was very drunk at the time it happened. </p> <p>Those are the facts for my family. Before further decisions are made about publishing the names, addresses and photographs of those who have murdered children who were strangers to them, or made really serious sexual assaults upon children, could we please be told the similar facts about all cases that have occurred within the last five or 10 years? Then we the public will be in a position to make an informed judgment as to whether lists should be available to all, with the risks of lynchings taking place on the guilty or by mistake on the innocent, or only to the police and to headteachers and others when they need to know. </p> <p><b>Name and address supplied </b><br></p> <p> \u0095 My friend Ted was a low-risk paedophile, not a pouncer nor a predator, but a man who, when in drink, played \"touching games\" with small boys, the sort of games most boys play at some time behind the bike sheds. But when sober, which was most of the time, he was a model citizen. </p> <p>He served a few prison sentences and each time, when he came out, the word went round among the local boys that if Ted had had a drink, he was good for a pound or two. They knocked at his door, put inviting notes through the letterbox, and on one occasion he appealed to the police to drive them away. But inevitably the day came when he'd been drinking and they got their \"pocket money\". </p> <p>Since imprisonment was getting nowhere, a constructive attempt was made to help him. He was found a flat where no one knew his background, a senior probation officer kept him under strict supervision, a medical specialist took him on for treatment and a group of friends kept in close touch with him personally and by telephone. He lived alone: there were often times when he needed support in his struggle to control his problem. </p> <p>And he did. He lived for another six years and he never reoffended. Were he alive now, all that dedicated professional and comradely support could count for nothing. A useful experiment in a different way of handling such a man would be negated.

  "What is it about William \"14-pints-a-day\" Hague's image that causes him so much trouble? Apart from the premature baldness, now resolved by his adoption of a menacing Grant Mitchell crop, his CV should be a spin doctor's dream. A \"normal\" middle-class family background, north of Watford too, a state school education, four As at A-level and straight into Oxford. There he both got a first and was president of the Union, a rare double. Thence into McKinsey's, the cult management consultancy which does not hire fools. <p>Onwards and upwards until, at 36, already an ex-cabinet minister, young William becomes the youngest Tory leader since Pitt (who got the job in 1793 when he was 24). He was a William too, come to think of it, nerdy and a bit of a boozer. As Cecil Parkinson used to say: \"At every stage William's done better than Tony Blair.\" And yet he still seems to get the personal stuff horribly wrong. Even making allowances for the August silly season in Fleet Street, yesterday's tabloids were, surely, a nightmare. </p> <p>\"I was Britain's biggest boozer,\" thundered the Mirror. \"Billy Liar,\" roared the Sun with its usual delicacy. The broadsheets were scarcely kinder. Even the FT managed \"Billy Fizz Hague tries to sink his sober image\" on page three, so that Britain's EU partners, just recovering from Euro 2000's battle of Charleroi, will be sure to see it. </p> <p>In one casual exchange with GQ magazine, Mr Hague had simultaneously annoyed a vast coalition of voters: health fascists joined forces with teetotallers, prigs with sophisticated teenies who know that simply everybody nowadays does drugs (that's why it's called e-commerce) on Saturday nights. All of them combined with anyone who wants to feminise the tone of our still rather masculine public life to denounce him for laddishness, social irresponsibility and a sheer lack of cool. It could be argued that the worst offence was caused to boozers of the old school, who simply didn't believe the claim. At 15 or 55 years old, it's a lot of beer. In Rotherham they claimed to remember that the lad who helped deliver the beer barrels on behalf of his dad's company, wasn't even a half-of-lager lout. </p> <p>Hence the Billy Fizz and Billy Pop jokes. They reinforce what remains the predominant public image of Hague the teenager as a nerd, who made \"that speech\" at the Tory conference in 1977, who read Hansard and kept byelection results, not football results, on his bedroom wall. We have been here before with Mr Hague. Back in 1997, he was photographed in a baseball cap and then drinking through a straw (beer presumably) out of a melon at the Notting Hill carnival. A young, happening-kind-of Tory leader, one who cared, had taken over, was the not-so-subliminal message. </p> <p>Except it didn't work, as Tory strategists came to realise. It wasn't the real Hague and it wasn't the right message after the slaughter of May 1. Hague was already busy remoulding his party well out of public gaze. Once he'd done that and finished apologising for past Tory error, he could start to move on policy reformation. </p> <p>The Hague Mk II who emerged in time for the 1999 European elections (along with the Grant Mitchell look) was harder and meaner. He focused on Tory core issues with wider resonance: the euro, law and order, asylum seekers entering Britain during the Kosovo war, enough to start getting Tony Blair rattled. No more Mr Nice Guy, and some cartoonists started to portray him in an uglier light than the short-trousered kid at Margaret Thatcher's side. Lately he has begun making speeches on education and health - he may tackle green issues soon - but Hague Mk II has been the key to the modest revival of Tory electoral fortunes. It is the Hague who will fight the coming election. </p> <p>What happened on the pages of GQ this week was not another attempt to reposition the leader's image, it was an accident. The interview was given weeks ago on the grounds, familiar enough to Mr Blair's handlers, that GQ is an upmarket lads' mag, the market leader in fact, which reaches thirty-something voters with lots of disposable cash who are too busy playing squash or shopping to read much. </p> <p> The interviewer was not just another hack either. Nicholas Coleridge is a media grandee, MD of the Cond\u00e9 Nast group which owns GQ, the Eton-and-Trinity son of a past chairman of Lloyds. It is a patsy interview; Mr Coleridge has decided Mr Hague is now the plucky underdog, but there is a distinct tone of condecension in the exchanges. This being GQ, there was a lot of detail about where Hague buys his suits (posh West End) and what colour shirts he likes (blue). His feet are size 9 and Ffion has purged his wide-lapel jackets. She buys him daft cufflinks. </p> <p>Fascinating or what? But politicians have to do this nowadays, though Gordon Brown's GQ interview on fashion would be rather short. The Tory leader was given space for a brief message: GQ should vote Tory for a better business climate, national sovereignty and improved public services. </p> <p>GQ played it up (hey, this is August), but the beer story is actually old. Hague has written it himself, as in the Times of November 15 1997: \"When I'd finished each delivery I'd always be given a pint of John Smith's as a reward. . . at five in the evening I'd be feeling pretty light-headed.\" </p> <p>Far more revealing for a modern populist was his inability to name the England football captain. Describing how he first moved in on Ffion Jenkins (one of his civil servants at the time) he also said that after an official dinner \"we went out socially to a bar in London\" - Hague-speak for \"had a drink\". </p> <p>Yet Mr Hague is a clever man, a witty and fluent public speaker who will, I suspect, surprise us all by surviving long enough to become prime minister over Michael Portillo's acquiescent body - one day. Little horrid has been said about Hague that was not said about Ted Heath or - the dumbos - Mrs T. </p> <p>Last night his aides were putting a brave face on the affair. It had helped to shift that stubbornly-held image voters have of him, as a southern public school boy and toff, they explained. A poll on Talk Radio showed 82% of callers more likely to vote for the 14-pint man than less. Sky TV's poll was running neck and neck. Just as adultery is no bar to high office in France, youthful boozing is not an impediment here. </p> <p>All this may be wishful thinking, but the Tories are surely right to argue that when a wimpish media stereotype clashes with a claim to be a 14-pint man it will produce a bang. All politicians reinvent themselves a bit to become more interesting and all, including Tony Blair, get caught out. </p> <p>The sad thing is that in an age of professionalised politics, when they all start so young, few have time to do or become anything interesting before they start polishing those leadership CVs. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:michael.white@theguardian.com\"> michael.white@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "A senior Labour backbencher last night demanded that the News of the World be prosecuted for inciting public disorder as a wave of mob violence continued after its decision to name convicted paedophiles. <p>Robin Corbett MP, chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, joined a chorus of concern over the attacks on sex offenders and innocent people wrongly identified by vigilantes. Yesterday police, a bishop and probation officers united in condemning the disorder that experts believe is putting children in more danger. </p> <p>Mr Corbett said: \"It was perfectly predictable when the News of the World started this what the outcome would be and I suspect they knew it as well. That is why I have asked the Home Office whether they will consider prosecution for incitement to public order offences.\" </p> <p>Last night vigilantes marched through an estate in Portsmouth for the sixth night in a row. Four innocent families have been forced to flee after being wrongly identified as harbouring sex offenders. </p> <p>Violence has also flared in Plymouth, a man was chased by a mob in Whitley, Berkshire, and two men accused of child sex offences have committed suicide. Police said a millionaire businessman, John Potter, arrested over child sex charges, had been found on Sunday night shot dead at his Kent home. </p> <p>Peter Gammon, spokesman for the Association of Police Superintendents, said the News of the World bore part of the blame for the unabating disorder. The newspaper's naming and shaming campaign followed the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne, eight. </p> <p>\"What they've created is an atmosphere of fear among members of the public, among parents and among sex offenders,\" Mr Gammon said. </p> <p>The violence was being initiated by thugs using parents' fears about paedophiles as an excuse for lawlessness. \"In most cases there is a violent element infiltrating these groups and initiating the violence,\" he said. \"The group mentality and group dynamic leads to people who are normally law abiding to join in. Violence begets violence.\" </p> <p>Last night the Church of England entered the debate. Richard Harries, the Bishop of Oxford, condemned the \"communal hysteria\" triggered by the paper's campaign. </p> <p>The bishop, who chairs the church's board for social responsibility, said: \"The News of the World has a lot to answer for. I would say this phenomenon is deeply disturbing and we've only got to remember examples like the witches of Salem, where communities can get caught up in communal hysteria.\" </p> <p>The bishop called for the vigilante action to stop, saying it made the problem of paedophiles worse. \"These are fellow human beings, they need to live in the community again and all attempts need to be made to rehabilitate them,\" he said. \"They can't spend the rest of their lives in prison.\" </p> <p>George Barrow, spokesman for the Association of Chief Officers of Probation, said the monitoring of paedophiles had been made more difficult: \"The supervision of sex offenders is designed around public protection, and if you damage our supervision you damage public protection. </p> <p>\"People on the register wrongly thought the News of the World had access to official information and therefore thought there was a disincentive to remain in contact with statutory bodies like probation and police.\" </p> <p>Last week the News of the World backed down on its pledge to publish the names and locations of paedophiles. Its editor, Rebekah Wade, had launched the campaign three weeks previously, despite advice from police and experts that such tactics could lead to violence. </p> <p>In a statement released before Mr Corbett's call for a prosecution, the paper said: \"The News of the World's campaign for the introduction of Sarah's law [legislation to give parents access to information about paedophiles in their area] is designed for the protection of children. To date, the newspaper has received nearly 350,000 signed petitions in support of the campaign.\" </p> <p>On the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth police were last night bracing themselves for fresh protests from vigilantes, who claim to have a list of 20 paedophiles living on the estate. </p> <p>Superintendent Bob Golding of Hampshire police confirmed that the four families moved off the estate had been wrongly targeted by the vigilante mob. \"They are innocent victims of gossip and rumour. There is nothing to suggest they had anything to do with paedophiles.\"</p>",
  "The controversial Russian mogul Boris Berezovsky warned yesterday of a new wave of strong-arm rule in Russia that could throttle hard won civil liberties and moved to establish an opposition movement aimed at weakening President Vladimir Putin. <p>Mr Berezovsky, a key Kremlin insider who was a close associate of President Boris Yeltsin and who was highly instrumental in securing the presidency for Mr Putin, fiercely criticised Russia's war in Chechnya and Mr Putin's current campaign to recentralise power. </p> <p>He recently resigned his seat in parliament in protest at Mr Putin's policies and yesterday unveiled plans to fill the opposition vacuum created by Mr Putin's increasing domination of Russia's political scene. </p> <p>His announcement coincided with the publication of a liberal manifesto signed by prominent figures from politics, the media, and the arts warning of Mr Putin's creeping authoritarian tendencies. </p> <p>The signatories included the novelist Vasili Aksenov, the theatre director Yuri Lyubimov, and the liberal Alexander Yakovlev, who as the architect of Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost policies played a huge role in undermining the Soviet communist dictatorship. </p> <p>At his news conference, Mr Berezovsky said that while Mr Putin has not abolished democratic freedoms in Russia, he has created the legal and political foundation for autocratic rule. \"It's not effectively an authoritarian regime yet, but formally it's already authoritarian,\" he said. </p> <p>The notoriously manipulative Mr Berezovsky has turned against Mr Putin in recent months, attacking the president's policies on Chechnya, on Russia's 89 regions, on the media and on business leaders - the infamous oligarchs of which he is one of the leaders. </p> <p>Apart from his extensive oil and car industry interests, Mr Berezovsky controls the main state television channel which he used ruthlessly last year to carry Mr Putin into the Kremlin. But he is now under pressure from the Putin camp to surrender control of the television channel and Putin aides are confident that a deal will soon be struck. </p> <p>However, opinion pollsters say that Mr Berezovsky is such a reviled figure with the Russian public that his opposition is likely to bolster Mr Putin's popularity. </p> <p>Other Moscow pundits say that the controversial magnate is the first substantial figure to break with Mr Putin and that he could be a dangerous rallying point and source of funding for a nascent opposition.</p>",
  "\u0095 A priority for the newly wed Gordon Brown on his return to London should be to register on Westminster's list of MP's interests his upgrade by Virgin Atlantic. Whether \"Prudence\" Brown was surprised to be upgraded from economy to Upper Class on his honeymoon flight to New York, worth at least \u00a31,200, is doubtful. Extracting upgrades from British Airways out of Heathrow, as seasoned travellers know, has become devilishly difficult. Virgin Atlantic is renowned as a soft touch for the famous. Although the airline says it tries to upgrade honeymooners wherever possible, accepting its largesse raises more than just questions about the morals of a man earning about \u00a390,000 a year. The serious conundrum is the potential conflict of interest. Brown is now indebted to Virgin. <p>Any future government decision regarding that omnipresent conglomerate will automatically arouse suspicions that Brown is repaying a favour. Since Virgin, among its myriad businesses, aggressively promotes Virgin Direct, its financial services arm, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will inevitably be treading on \"Frank's\" toes very soon. Or not, and that is the potential conflict he should have avoided. </p> <p>Like all self-proclaimed idealists, Brown's self-delusion shades into hypocrisy. Brownites and Blairites, the praised but opportunistic standard-bearers of anti-sleaze in 1997, scathingly shrug off the accusations of the standard-bearers of real faith. </p> <p>For the latter, the chosen holidays of Mr and Mrs Blair expose an unexpected whiff of greed. Or worse. The First Family's enthusiasm for freebies and flights on royal jets was inexplicable until the recent leak of the \"touchstone\" memo. The worst suspicions of benign sceptics were confirmed. For the first time, Britain is ruled by an uneducated nihilist, posing as an idealist, whose moral compass is dictated by the constant massage of his vanity. In the vernacular, Blair is weak and vulgar. </p> <p>Vulgarity is an unfashionable expression in the battle against the corrosion inflicted by the nauseatingly politically correct. The legacy of the 60s generation, whose lofty ideals are validated by the continuing relevance of its philosophers, writers, artists, actors and musicians, has become a virus. The battle for toler ance, peace and understanding of society 30 years ago has debased too many of its beneficiaries. The love to shock in the 60s was a legitimate weapon of political argument. Now it is a cause of social destruction. The fight for tolerance of private values has become the minority's aggressive intolerance of the majority. Blair's Britain censors those who despise George Michael's cottaging in public lavatories, derides those shocked by the shameless flaunting of dishonesty by public icons and encourages destructive drunkenness and sexual hooliganism - notwithstanding those preposterous spot fines. Blair's vulgarity was to invite Liam Gallagher to Downing Street - in praise of drugs, debauchery and stupidity - and not the Fellows of the Royal Society. In consequence, his moral sermons invite scorn. </p> <p>Those who delight in freebies, lie about health statistics, accept \u00a31m from Bernie Ecclestone and allow Peter Mandelson's unapologetic return to the government are cowardly when confronting their own moral dilemmas. Fat cats, snouts in the trough and other images of greed are alien to those insensitive about conflicts of interest. Their achilles heel is the Dome in Greenwich. The dome was the vulgarians' intended temple. Their devious response to its predicted disaster mirrors their taste for holiday freebies. Gerald Kaufman, Blair's culture stooge, delighted in denigrating the disorganisation of the excellent Royal Opera's \u00a380m reconstruction scheme for real culture, but is muted in naming and shaming those responsible for the criminal waste of \u00a3790m on vulgarity. Double standards and betraying those searching for a home for the honest comes with their turf. </p> <p>At the end of the month, the anti-vulgarians will wonder whether Mr and Mrs Gordon Brown have travelled with the oiks on their return flight to London, or placed themselves further in \"Frank's\" debt by accepting another upgrade. Best odds for those who bet he cannot resist. </p> <p><b>It could be him. Then again...</b></p> <p>These are nervous days for Sir Richard Branson, holidaying in his private idyll in the Virgin islands. In the next few days, the Lottery commission will announce whether Sir Richard or Camelot has won the new franchise for the Lottery. Running the \u00a336bn business would secure Branson's position in Britain's daily life and grant him \"the most important thing in my life\". </p> <p>One can guess that both Branson and Camelot are privately infuriated by the apparent incompetence of the commission. Unlike the previous regulators, who chose between eight bidders in three months, this group was given, last January, five months to choose one or the other. They have repeatedly delayed their announcement. </p> <p>One reason is fear. The selection requires the approval of Chris Smith and probably Tony Blair. Too much depends on the Lottery's billions, so every repercussion, not least a request for judicial review, necessi tates anticipation. Whatever the result, there will be turmoil. Although a success for Camelot would probably not provoke Branson to repeat his 1994 outburst and sulks in Holland Park - if only because he is thousands of miles away - his response is unlikely to be measured. </p> <p>If Branson wins, Camelot may try to establish a rival lottery. Without inheriting Camelot's outlets and organisation, Branson will struggle to match its expertise. Inevitably, he will ignore the problems and loudly proclaim the dawn of a new era. Camelot's lottery has been damned by Branson as \"dull\". Under his personal control, it will be a hilarious rollercoaster. What has Blair chosen in an election year? The cautious should bet on safety.</p> <p><b>Dyke takes the low road</b></p> <p>Newly appointed chief executives of any organisation love to make an impression by issuing instant edicts. Greg Dyke, the now not so new director-general of the BBC, proclaimed the end of croissants and chauffeured limousines. The real victim of the no-car diktat was Niven Sinclair, a charming Scotsman, who started his business in 1977 by personally driving his single car for Panorama. Now he controls about 150 cars. Dyke's edict that BBC personnel and guests should use either public transport or cheap minicabs devastated Sinclair's business. To the glee of BBC Transport, a department of unfathomable mystery, their rival was \"out\". </p> <p>Some weeks later, Sinclair is laughing all the way to the bank. So many BBC guests were lost on their way to the studios thanks to Albanian minicab drivers and breakdowns on the Central Line that Dyke approved Sinclair's return. The wily Scot demanded a stiff price to resolve the uproar. As well as demanding higher rates, he made a bid to take over BBC transport. His offer, as they say, is \"being considered\". </p> <p>No news yet about the fate of the croissants, but it augurs poorly for those aghast at the Visigoth's proposal to shove quality television from BBC1 and 2 on to minority channels. All those who condemned Dyke's appointment as a victory for intellectual frailty reflect that he is tinkering. Dyke has done nothing to reverse the carnage wreaked by Birt or announced one appointment that guarantees original programmes. </p> <p>In the era of vulgarity, Dyke's vision will be embraced. The spiral downwards will be hastened. Those who enjoyed the prime of Sir Robin Day are truly the blessed. </p> <p>\u0095 Francis Wheen returns next Wednesday.</p>",
  "A rapist with an obsession for knives and guns was last night on the run after being convicted of a series of sex attacks across Britain. <p>Trevor Masters, 48, was on conditional bail when he disappeared from a Cardiff guest house on Monday as a crown court jury considered 14 verdicts over his attacks on four victims. </p> <p>A news blackout imposed by Judge John Griffith Williams QC to prevent the jury being prejudiced by Masters' escape was yesterday lifted after nine guilty verdicts for rape, sex assaults and actual bodily harm were returned. </p> <p>Police in south Wales warned women about the 6ft fugitive described as \"dangerous but charming\" and capable of physical and sexual brutality. </p> <p>The force refused to comment on why Masters had been granted bail while facing such serious charges. </p> <p>Detective Constable Martyn Edwards, of Gwent police, who investigated the case, described Masters as a womaniser and a charmer: \"He is capable of befriending a woman and then abusing her. He is physically and sexually brutal.\" </p> <p>Parkkeeper Masters had an \"an unhealthy obsession with weapons such as knives and bayonets\", DC Edwards said, and though police had seized his firearms, he had held them illegally in the past. </p> <p>A warrant was issued for his arrest and an all ports alert was sent out by police after he \"absconded\", but it was feared he may have changed his appearance. Masters was understood to have fled after hearing the evidence weigh against him. </p> <p>Prosecutor Martin Farmer QC told the court how his first victim, then 26, met Masters in Cornwall. He later raped her in Redditch, Worcestershire, when he was a farm worker. </p> <p>Masters was also accused of tying one victim to a four-poster bed, threatening another with a gun and holding another down with a weight-lifting bar. He sexually abused a girl aged 10 and tried to commit serious offences against her. </p> <p>Mr Farmer added: \"He was eventually arrested and was interviewed at great length. At no stage did he concede he behaved improperly to anybody.\" </p> <p>The jury found Masters, formerly of Blaenavon, Gwent, and more recently Kington, Herefordshire, guilty of one rape, three counts of actual bodily harm against a woman, now aged 50, and two indecent assaults and two attempted serious sexual offences against a child, who is now aged 28. </p> <p>He was also convicted of an indecent assault on a woman, now 27, when she was under the age of 16. The jury failed to reach a verdict on another charge of indecent assault on her. </p> <p>Masters was found not guilty of two rapes and two serious sexual offences against a woman he met in Blaenavon when she was 28. </p> <p>During the three-week trial he denied carrying out attacks on the women and young girls over a 20-year period. </p> <p>Masters is understood to originally come from Redditch where he still has family ties, as well as numerous contacts in Britain and abroad, including Cornwall, Gwent, Shropshire and Herefordshire and France. </p> <p>He is described as athletic, around 6ft, with long, brown hair that can be tied back in a ponytail and he had a beard.</p>",
  "Most New Yorkers have probably never heard of Birkenhead, but the Merseyside town which inspired the Big Apple's Central Park has finally won recognition for its pioneering \"green lung\". <p>The biggest share - \u00a36m - of a national lottery programme for urban parks, announced yesterday, has gone to the Swiss bridge, Victorian kiosk and other features of Birkenhead Park. </p> <p>The funding, part of a \u00a314m handout which will also regenerate parks in Leeds, Rochdale and Reading, completes a \u00a310m package for the acres by the river Mersey that claim to be the oldest municipal park in the world. </p> <p>Birkenhead is the only Grade I listed municipal park in Britain but has suffered from underfunding, neglect and vandalism. Mike Garbutt of the Wirral ranger service, who put together the rescue package, said: \"What we want to do is reinstate its horticultural value and bring back the colours and smells they enjoyed in Victorian times.\" </p> <p>The scheme will re-landscape the approach to the park, provide new railings and stone piers, clean up the main lake and its Swiss bridge and provide a \u00a31m visitors' centre. </p> <p>The park will be advertised internationally, with a focus on New York, to increase tourism to the area. </p> <p>Other grants from the heritage lottery fund will revive Roundhay and Kirkstall Abbey parks in Leeds and help the restoration of the SS Great Britain and the Bristol dockyard where the ship, once the largest in the world, is berthed. </p> <p>Birkenhead Park was designed by the garden architect James Paxton, whose work inspired Calvert Vaux, the British-born designer who laid out Central Park with the American writer Frederick Law Olmsted after winning a competition in 1857.</p>",
  "It was a scandal that rocked the nation: an aristocratic beauty was photographed performing fellatio on a lover, while shots of another man gratifying himself were unearthed in her boudoir. <p>The sexually explicit Polaroid snaps proved central in the 1963 divorce of the Duke and Duchess of Argyll, and became part of a government investigation. </p> <p>The duchess's reputation was ruined, but her lover escaped blameless, his identity preserved for almost 40 years by the camera cutting him off at the neck. </p> <p>Tonight, the mystery of the \"headless man\" - or rather headless men - is resolved for the first time, with new evidence identifying not one, but two, lovers. </p> <p>The man in the more notorious shot is unveiled as Duncan Sandys, then a cabinet minister, and his masturbating rival as Douglas Fairbanks Jr, the Hollywood legend who dallied with Marlene Dietrich and married Joan Crawford. </p> <p>The two men's identities are revealed in a Channel 4 documentary to be shown tonight, Secret History: The Duchess and the Headless Man, which draws on the memories of the duchess's confidante, who identifies Sandys, and previously unpublished evidence gathered by the nation's then most senior law lord, Lord Denning. This formed part of his inquiry into security risks following the resignation of the then secretary of state for war, John Profumo. </p> <p>Sandys's identity is \"conclusively proved\", the documentary makers believe, by the duchess's claim that the only Polaroid camera in the country at the time had been lent to the Ministry of Defence, where Sandys was a minister. Fairbanks is nailed by his handwriting. </p> <p>The Argyll case, heard in March 1963 - the same month John Profumo lied to the Commons about his relationship Christine Keeler - was the longest and most sensational divorce to occur in Britain. </p> <p>Margaret Argyll, the only child of a self-made Scottish millionaire, was a society beauty who her husband alleged had slept with 88 men, including two cabinet ministers and three royals. </p> <p>Profumo resigned in early June but, before the month was out, the precarious Macmillan government was rocked by another threat, and looked in danger of being toppled. </p> <p>At a stormy cabinet meeting on June 20, Sandys, the son-in-law of Winston Churchill, confessed he was rumoured to be the person in the erotic shots, which, at that time, were presumed to be of one man. </p> <p>He offered to resign but Macmillan managed to dissuade him by ensuring Lord Denning, who had been commissioned to investigate the Profumo scandal, also investigated the identity of the headless lover. </p> <p>For this Denning, the master of the rolls, had a plan. On the four shots of the man in different states of arousal were handwritten captions: \"before\", \"thinking of you\", \"during - oh\", and \"finished\". If he could match the handwriting, he would find his man. </p> <p>He invited the five key suspects - Sandys, Fairbanks, American businessman John Cohane, Peter Combe, an ex-press officer at the Savoy, and Sigismund von Braun, the diplomat brother of the Nazi scientist Werner von Braun - to the Treasury and asked for their help in a \"very delicate matter\". </p> <p>As they arrived, each signed the visitor's register. Their handwriting was analysed by a graphologist, and the results proved conclusive. As the broadcaster Peter Jay, then a young Treasury official, tells the documentary: \"The headless man identified by the handwriting expert and therefore identified by Lord Denning, though he didn't write this down in his report, was, in fact, the actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr.\" </p> <p>Duncan Sandys, who in 1974 was given a peerage, appeared to be in the clear - a fact confirmed by a Harley Street doctor who concluded his pubic hair did not correspond with that in the masturbation photos. </p> <p>But tonight's documentary confirms the other photograph clearly showed a different man whose identity the duchess hinted at to her close friend Paul Vaughan just before her death. </p> <p>\"She did say to me quite clearly that, 'Of course, sweetie, the only Polaroid camera in the country at this time had been lent to the Ministry of Defence,'\" recalls Mr Vaughan. \"If that wasn't running a flag up the flag pole, I don't know what was. She wanted someone to know.\" Analysis of the film suggests the photo was taken in 1957, at which stage Sandys held his defence post. </p> <p>\"We believe it's pretty definitive,\" said Dan Corn, the programme's producer. \"It's ironic because he effectively got away with it by being cleared by Denning.\" </p> <p>The duchess died in a Pimlico nursing home in July 1993, without even hinting at the identity of her other lover. But despite this discretion, she never recovered from her reputation being so besmirched during her divorce. </p> <p>Summing up, the judge, Lord Wheatley, said: \"She was a highly sexed woman who had ceased to be satisfied with normal relations and had started to indulge in disgusting sexual activities.\"</p>",
  "<p>You could be forgiven for thinking that <a href=\"http://www.qxl.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">QXL</a> was the UK's biggest internet auction site considering all the publicity it has received. However, largely through word of mouse, this position looks likely to belong to <a href=\"http://www.eBay.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">eBay.co.uk</a>, the recently opened branch of ebay.com. </p> <p>EBay UK had quietly built up to 127,000 users by the end of March, and is confident this figure will double by the end of the year. What is remarkable is that while QXL built up its user base through a constant stream of media coverage, eBay.co.uk, echoing its US parent site, has not yet resorted to large advertising campaigns. </p> <p>Ebay.com is a salutary tale for all those recent venture capital-backed web launches. It started in September 1995, an experimental site set up by Pierre Omidyar of San Jose, California. Only when it took off did Omidyar give up the day job. </p> <p>Although much imitated, eBay.com kept a lead by a constant process of customer- led innovation. Perhaps eBay's greatest innovation is its advanced feedback system, which rates traders by the number of successful transactions they have made. In a sector still plagued by fears of fraud, this has stimulated confidence in trade at eBay. It is estimated that 20% of those selling on eBay.com make a living from it. </p> <p>In contrast to the slickness of eBay, QXL's pages suffer slow links, poor site navigation and tiny print that take all the fun out of browsing. Where eBay's much copied green, blue, red and yellow logo on a white background suggests the variety of the auctions on its site, QXL's clumsy grey and orange graphics conjure up poor taste and drabness. This surely will be changed soon, though, worryingly, QXL seems to be spending its shareholders' money, on charging around Europe buying any auction site of note. </p> <p>QXL will not provide an exact figure of its UK users, but its current figure for its eight country European operation is 680,000. If the UK changes to the euro then QXL will be laughing. In the meantime, cross-Europe trades are problematic, not only because of currency differences, but also because of the language barriers. </p> <p>EBay's advantage over QXL creates its own problems. The demands that eBay's 15.8 million users worldwide (July 2000 figures) make on its system have led to lengthy system outages. At worst these breaks in service, when its system gets updated and cleaned, have led to down-times lasting days. There are weekly Friday morning shutdowns, between 1am and 5am West Coast time to cause minimum distress to US users. Unfortunately. for UK users, who are eight hours ahead, this wipes out most of the daylight hours of Friday morning. </p> <p>EBay has promised to reduce these outages to several minutes some time in the future. Still, tackling eBay head on with consumer-to-consumer auctions is not a battle QXL looks likely to win. But this does not mean eBay is unbeatable: in the USA, many online auction sites are thriving by offering services different to eBay. </p> <p>In the UK, auction sites such as Firedup.com do this by concentrating on merchant auctions alone. Owned by News International, the site benefits from constant free promotion in the Sun, Sunday Times and Times. </p> <p>Another site offering a different service is UK Yahoo auctions. The US branch has become eBay.com's only serious competitor through its policy of charging no listing or sales fees. In return it offers a low-profile site with next to no customer assistance. </p> <p>This policy of minimum maintenance has encouraged sellers of hardcore pornography and Nazi memorabilia, to the detriment of the site's reputation. It also has had a number of prank auctions. Recently someone from Oklahoma was selling a certain \"Jake Martin\" in the other goods and services category under the heading \"Stupid Person\". </p> <p>Other auction sites well worth checking out include <a href=\"http://sothebys.amazon.com\" target=\"_new\">http://sothebys.amazon.com</a>, which features the auctions of accredited dealers in collectables and memorabilia. <a href=\"http://www.bhauction.com\">The Beverley Hills charity auction site</a>, where you can bid for signed photos of Warren Beatty, Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone et al, is good for a browse.

  "<p><strong> Jackpot</strong> (BBC2) is a series about gamblers. Having made his million, Pat Chambers can indulge his passion for racing greyhounds. Two of his young dogs were entered for the Romford Puppy Cup. \"Come on, my son! Goo-on, my boy!\" roared Pat, like a moose calling another moose long distance. I wondered how he made his million. I often find myself wondering that. Pat's open countenance and prodigious lung power suggested he sold something. </p> <p>And so it proved. He and his wife Nicky were on their way to the Puppy Cup Final in a white stretch Mercedes, drinking champagne and, well, moist, as Pat put it. He remembered without nostalgia the house where he was born. \"I remember living on a council estate with not two pennies to rub together. I picked mushrooms at 16 to buy my first moped. Then I sold fish door to door. Then I was Eggman Pat, selling eggs. Then I started selling windows. Then I started a window company. And that made me a millionaire.\" Now he has an estate in the country and a heart condition. </p> <p>I considered this fishy formula doubtfully. I've asked several millionaires how they made their money. They all said \"hard work\", but I'd say they were gamblers. I think it was the Queen who asked one of Rupert Murdoch's editors to describe his proprietor in a word. \"A gambler, ma'am.\" She said, dryly, \"He seems to be winning then, doesn't he?\" </p> <p>Pat says women don't like gambling. He thinks it's genetic. </p> <p>The film was ill-named Puppy Love. I never saw him pat his dogs, even when the puppies in his paddock put their paws on the fence and panted engagingly. He said \"The way you rear a greyhound puppy is totally different to the way you'd rear a pet. They're treated like kings, really. They probably enjoy their lives more than most pets because they're doing what they were bred to do. Not many pets were bred to sit on a settee.\" His castellated house is full of images of greyhounds. The real dogs are outside in concrete kennels. </p> <p>Greyhounds race at night by sodium light, which gives a sense of something eerie going on. The dogs parted the air like combs. Pat roared: \"Come on, Droopy! Please, please! Goo-on, my boy!\" Few thought Droopy could get round the big, raw-boned favourite, but Droopy did. Suddenly Pat was surrounded by friends, who were not there before. \"That's what it's all about\", he shouted. \"That sensational feeling! Winning! Winning!\" He'd won \u00a312.40, but I don't think that's what he meant. </p> <p> <strong> The Lipstick Years </strong> (BBC 2) was about playing second fiddle. The liveliest contributor was, of course, Dr Margaret Cook, Robin's ex. She turns up from time to time like those vengeful, deposed Shakespearean queens, who cast such a blight on the coronation buffet. Pausing only to slip into her steel-capped wellies, she waded in. \"If Robin had decided to drop Gaynor and stay with me, I would have felt very betrayed and yet been expected to stand up and say: 'He's all right really', as Mary Archer has had to do recently.\" (Mary Archer, like Dr Cook, is an exceptionally clever scientist married to something genetically indistinguishable from a terrier.) </p> <p>\"I have been told I was one of the most crucial factors in helping him to get the nomination. So he did quite coldly use me in that way. I sometimes remind myself that he spent 18 years in opposition and very little of what he did was essential to anybody. Except his own career. In terms of day-to-day working for the good of people, I was probably achieving vastly more than he was in that 18 years.\" </p> <p>Far be it from me to get on the wrong side of Dr Cook, but watching Robin Cook snapping at the heels of power was one of the delights of those years. He was very good at it. So is she. </p> <p>This week Ken Barlow, hard-hitting columnist of the Weatherfield Gazette, is writing about cemeteries, inspired by the continued presence of his mother-in-law (\"You're not writing another of them columns!\") The Gazette also has a theatre critic in a floppy bow tie, who is sniffing round Rita, formerly known as the Weatherfield Nightingale. However, it has no TV critic. No one watches telly in <strong> Coronation Street</strong> (ITV). None of those chimney pots, you may have noticed, sprouts an aerial. As Curly said recently, watching the usual street theatre: \"It's better than telly.\"</p>",
  "Variant CJD, the human form of mad cow disease, could ultimately claim 136,000 lives, according to Oxford scientists. <p>But this figure is the worst case scenario, say statisticians who have been trying to map the impact of the disease on the British population. They report in Nature today that this will be the number of deaths if the incubation period for the disease is 60 years or more. </p> <p>When the first cases of vCJD shocked ministers in 1996 - they had repeatedly claimed that the mysterious cattle disease could not be a danger to humans - there seemed no limit to the numbers potentially at risk from infected beef. A European committee conjectured that a single beast with BSE could put 500,000 people at risk. </p> <p>But Neil Ferguson, Azra Ghani, Christl Donnelly and Roy Anderson at the Wellcome Trust centre for epidemiology at Oxford University began looking at the pattern of cases and the ages of the victims, the percentage of the population most at risk, the relative infectivity of cattle at the incubation stage and the effectiveness of control measures. They calculated up to 5m scenarios and then matched them against the cases of the disease in humans. </p> <p>Any sick animal that got into the food market was liable to infect no more than two individuals, and only 40% of the population was genetically susceptible. That left one key factor in the calculation - the mean incubation period of the disease itself. If the incubation period was less than 20 years, then there could be as few as 63 cases. If the incubation period stretched almost to lifetime length, then there were likely to be 136,000. What mattered over the next few years was the annual rate of cases. </p> <p>\"If the average annual incidence of vCJD over the next three years is fewer than 15 cases, then the maximum total number of cases would fall to 20,000,\" they write. </p> <p>Classical or sporadic CJD is a disease of the old. But the victims of vCJD are all relatively young. The statisticians were anxious to see if the average ages of the cases increased with time. If they did, then it would mean that everybody was equally susceptible but younger people had shorter incubation periods. They now rule out that possibility. </p> <p>\"It is something about being young that makes you vulnerable,\" said Dr Ghani. \"Either vulnerable or exposed to a greater extent. It could be just the types of food that people eat, but it is impossible in this sort of statistics to distinguish between the two. The upper limit to the epidemic scenario has decreased quite substantially but it is still very large.\"</p>",
  "The boroughs of Havering, Bexley and Redbridge may not be the most sought after areas of London, but in one respect, at least, places with unfashionable postcodes have a distinct advantage over trendier parts of the capital. <p>According to figures from the Metropolitan police, they have far fewer murders than anywhere else in London. </p> <p>Although violent crime in London has soared over the past two years, fresh statistics show the rise has concentrated in particular hotspots, such as Hackney in the east end of the capital, and Westminster in its centre, rather than fanning out evenly across the City of London and the capital's 32 boroughs. </p> <p>Between 1997 and 1999 there were 29 murders in Westminster, which has Soho and the West End within its boundary. Lewisham, in the south, had 28 and there were 27 each in Brent, in the north-west of London, and Lambeth, in the south. The north London boroughs of Camden and Islington were not far behind, with 19 and 22 respectively. </p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, there were no murders in the City of London, while Havering and Bexley in the east and south-east recorded two each. </p> <p>The total number of murders in London during the period was 429, the highest two-year figure for more than 10 years. Police pointed out that between a quarter and half of murders were \"domestic\" and that the overall clear-up rate was between 80% and 90%. But officers have a growing problem on their hands. </p> <p>The recent surge in murders has been caused by a rise in violent underworld activity with at least 100 of the killings drug related. Drive-by shootings and assassinations by self-styled Yardie gangsters, the Jamaican drug barons who control the trade in crack cocaine in inner cities, have had the biggest impact. </p> <p>At least 29 people were killed in Yardie-related \"hits\" last year. There have been six murders this year, and 21 attempted murders. Almost all the incidents were \"black on black\", although white crime families are still the dominant force in the underworld. </p> <p>A breakdown of the figures by analysts at Scotland Yard revealed a third of the people murdered in the past two years was black and 46 of those killed had been shot. Of the 249 white people murdered, 14 were shot. </p> <p>Soho, a traditional crime centre, is being rivalled by Brixton, in the south, Harlesden, in the north-west and Dalston, in the east, for the number of serious incidents. </p> <p>The Met now wants to identify London's murder hotspots to help tackle the gangsters head on. One innovation was the introduction last month of three fast-response homicide assessment teams (HATs), which are on permanent patrol waiting to be called to murder scenes. </p> <p>HATs should give detectives the best chance of getting important evidence in the \"golden hour\" after a murder. Each HAT team has a forensic scientist to ensure the scene can be sealed off quickly. </p> <p>The HATs report to a new department, the serious crime group, which has taken overall charge of murder, kidnap, shooting and organised crime investigations across London. </p> <p>The SCG has also assumed responsibility for Operation Trident - the team looking at Yardie crime - the fraud squad and the firearms unit. </p> <p>Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bill Griffiths, who is in overall command, said: \"We have identified very distinctive murder hotspots. Our job is to get to incidents in the golden hour and the HATs have everything they need to get a grip of the scene.\" </p> <p>The Met also wants to encourage partnerships between local councils and the police. Bexley is a prime example. </p> <p>\"We were one of the first boroughs to introduce community safety initiatives,\" said a council spokesman. \"We don't have the bright lights of some places in the centre of town. But this is a safe place to live.\"</p>",
  "When Earl Peel steps on to his grouse moor on Saturday, to blast a few bundles of feathers out of existence, he could be forgiven for experiencing a certain smugness. Infestations of ticks are likely to make this a less than Glorious 12th, but his diligent protection of his land appears to have forestalled a more pressing threat to the traditional values he has vowed to defend. <p>This was to have been the last season in which the bloody recreation of the few could be used to justify banning the quiet recreation of the many. Had all gone to plan, by next summer the government would have begun to implement the carefully regulated, if timid, right to roam on the mountains, moorlands, rough pastures and commons of England and Wales. No longer would we be forbidden to walk the wild uplands on the pretext that we - rather than the people blowing them to pieces - might disturb the grouse. No longer would we be banned from lying in the grass and watching the clouds go by. The land from which, through theft and violence, we have so long been excluded would have been, in some small way, ours once more. </p> <p>But one of Britain's most ludicrous anachronisms - our exclusion from the countryside - appears to have been preserved by an even more absurd one: the House of Lords. Earl Peel and a number of his Tory conspirators, nearly all of whom (whether hereditary or appointed) are major landowners, have shown that, though reduced in number, they can still ruin everyone else's enjoyment. Through a blatant and outrageous filibuster, they may have succeeded in pushing the countryside and rights of way bill into oblivion. </p> <p> During the debate on the bill in June, Earl Peel complained that \"it is based on ideology rather than common sense\". After mocking townies for their ignorance of the countryside from which they have been banned and insisting that a right to roam will lead inexorably to devil worship in rural areas, he and his peers went on to show us what true common sense entails. </p> <p>Grouse moors, Earl Peel insisted, are rich in wildlife as a result of stringent \"predator control\": to preserve the birds and mammals, in other words, some of the rarest of them have to be eliminated. Endangered stag beetles and adders, Earl Ferrers reasoned, should no longer be protected, but should be stamped on, on the basis that they \"are nasty, beastly things: They bite.\" The red grouse, Baroness Masham argued, must not be disturbed, because it \"has a unique flavour and it is a great delicacy for many people\". Four noble lords, Earl Peel among them, assured the house that the Association of Chief Police Officers has called for a ban on walking after dark. But when the Ramblers' Association contacted ACPO, it insisted it had done no such thing. </p> <p>A fortnight ago, they tabled amendments to the bill. The places in which people could walk, Baroness Byford and Lord Glentoran insisted, must not include \"land predominantly covered by water\", roads, schools, hospitals, film studios or rubbish dumps. As none of these were to be included in the bill anyway, and as subaquatic rambling has yet to become a major sport in Britain, the amendments might seem less than urgent. But all must be debated before the bill can move on. Having complained that \"the timetable of the bill [renders it] totally unworkable\", Baroness Byford set out to ensure that it did just this. </p> <p>\"It is not right,\" Earl Ferrers insisted during the debate in June, \"to fetter, curtail and even threaten with criminal sanctions those who know what the countryside is about.\" It would be unfair, Baroness Byford suggested, to \"prevent people from participating in their lawful recreation\". They were talking, of course, about hunting, but the principle surely applies to every traditional rural pursuit. So it comes as something of a surprise to discover that these great defenders of human liberty have also tabled an amendment which would turn into criminal offences swimming in rivers and streams, sailing, rowing, canoeing, camping, organised games and, marvellously, annoying a landowner. </p> <p>Now forgive me if I'm wrong, but it was my understanding that the whole point of a reformed House of Lords was that a tiny special interest group should no longer be able to hold the rest of the nation to ransom. Yet these amendments are as preposterous as any tabled in the bad old days of hereditary rule. </p> <p>Surely it is obvious to anyone that this ridiculous second chamber isn't working? As Baroness Byford remarked, while discussing a different class of vandals: \"Once again, we must legislate for the few who seek pleasure in destroying the results of so much work.\" </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "One person died and three others - including a Briton - were injured during a shooting incident near a housing complex for foreigners in Saudi Arabia yesterday. <p>A group of BAE Systems workers had left the compound in two cars and were heading into town when they came under attack, a Foreign Office spokesman said. \"One car had a bullet through its windscreen. The other was abandoned by its occupants, but they got back safely.\" </p> <p>The Saudi defence ministry later named the attacker as Yasir Ahmed Aboud al-Qassadi, a Saudi university student. It said air force guards at the complex had returned fire and arrested him. </p> <p>A Briton in one of the cars suffered a grazed hand, apparently from a ricochet. The dead man and the two injured were all guards. </p> <p>The complex, at Khamis Mishait in the south-western Asir province, houses mainly BAE Systems workers providing support services for the King Faisal air base, one of seven military bases in the kingdom. </p> <p>BAE Systems has about 5,500 employees in Saudi Arabia, of various nationalities. </p> <p>Last night the Foreign Office said the attack did not appear to be politically motivated. There have, however, been security concerns in the kingdom since the bombing of two US military complexes in 1995 and 1996, which killed 26 people, mostly Americans.</p>",
  "Inadequate pay and an ever-increasing workload have led to a serious \"talent drain\" at the top of the teaching profession, headteachers warned yesterday. <p>They urged the government to give all headteachers an immediate salary rise of \u00a33,000, and to take urgent steps to cut red tape in schools, in order to stop a waste of high class talent through the most experienced heads taking early retirement. </p> <p>The warning came from the National Association of Head Teachers, which released figures showing that advertisements for headships were running at their highest level for several years, figures it will submit to the teachers' pay review body next month, ahead of the pay round. </p> <p>There were 1,799 ads for heads' jobs published in the Times Educational Supplement between January and June - up 40% on the same time last year and 50% ahead of the 1998 figures. The only year when there were more, 2,261, was 1997, due to thousands of heads rushing to take early retirement when the previous government tightened the rules. </p> <p>The association said that the statistics had \"stark messages\" for the government, given the combined difficulties of losing experienced heads and failing to attract high quality replacements. Most heads leaving were in the 50-59 age group, often simply taking early retirement rather than seeking alternative employment. </p> <p>Despite the attention given to so-called \"super-heads\" who command salaries of more than \u00a370,000, the association complained that, in general terms, heads' pay did not equate with the ever-growing demands of their jobs; it claimed they had three worries: pay, bureaucracy, and lack of control over budgets. </p> <p>The general secretary, David Hart, said: \"This country can ill afford a headteacher brain drain of this magnitude. Too much high class talent is being wasted and sacrificed on the altar of bureaucracy, red tape, inadequate funding and less than satisfactory pay levels. </p> <p>\"The government promised pressure and support for schools in equal measure. The pressure has been intense, the support has, so far, been conspicuous by its relative absence. Until the government's commitment has been translated into actual delivery, heads will continue to leave and senior staff will decide that the job of being a head is not worth the candle.\" </p> <p>Average pay for a primary head was \u00a335,000 but should be between \u00a338,000 and \u00a344,000, Mr Hart added. Similarly, secondary heads on an average of \u00a351,000 should be on between \u00a354,000 and \u00a362,000. Such sums might change the minds of those thinking of leaving or unwilling to apply, he said. </p> <p>Bob Carstairs, assistant general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, said the national association's conclusions were in line with a survey of its own: \"The shortage of heads is particularly serious in some parts of the country such as Essex and London\". </p> <p>A Department for Education and Employment spokesman claimed that at least half the 511 additional vacancies were the result of a new retirement scheme that the national assocation itself had lobbied for, allowing \"burned out\" heads to take on lighter duties or quit the profession. </p> <p>Heads could also earn up to \u00a376,000 in certain posts, he said, adding that, while there was more work associated with the government's literacy and numeracy strategies, moves were under way to cut paperwork in schools by half.</p>",
  "Gangland shootouts, rising juvenile violence and a big increase in serious offences have raised fears that Japan - one of the safest countries in the world - is losing the battle against crime. <p>Official statistics show that Japan is in the middle of its worst crime wave in two decades, and its police service, which has been plagued by scandal, seems unable to meet the challenge.</p> <p>Just this week, two yakuza gangsters were killed and five injured in a sword and gun battle with members of a rightwing political group in Tokyo. Police have detained six members of a gang affiliated to the Sumiyoshi-kai, one of the three biggest crime syndicates in Japan, but other suspects are still at large.</p> <p>Although Britain and America remain far more dangerous, the crime wave has prompted calls for action by politicians and generated anxious editorials in the media.</p> <p>While the number of offences has increased, the arrest rate has declined. In the first six months of this year, the national police agency (NPA) investigated 1.1m crimes, an increase of 12% on the same period of 1999, and the first time that the half-year figure has exceeded 1m.</p> <p>During this period, the number of arrests fell by more than 20% to 281,000, prompting police officials to acknowledge that investigators can no longer keep up. The admission - from a police service at a low point in terms of morale and public respect - is seen as a plea both for sympathy and extra resources.</p> <p>Since late last year, the NPA has been embroiled in a series of scandals, culminating in the resignation of the country's top police officer after revelations of a high-level cover-up of drug abuse by a senior officer.</p> <p>Police methods have also come under fire, particularly after the discovery of a 19-year-old woman who had been held captive for more than nine years in the home of a child abuser. Detectives had ignored tip-offs that might have led to the teenager's release on several occasions.</p> <p>The arrest rate for murder, burglary and arson may have dropped by 12% from January to June, but for many Japanese, the most alarming crimes have been those which the police have been powerless to stop: random acts of violence by youngsters offending for the first time.</p> <p>The number of murders by teenagers almost doubled - from 27 to 53 - in the first six months of the year. The cases include a 17-year-old boy who clubbed a schoolmate and his mother to death after being bullied.The number of minors arrested for using stimulants has jumped by 45%.</p> <p>Experts are divided on the causes of this crime wave. Some say it is a reflection of the hardships of a country still struggling to emerge from its worst recession in 50 years, but many psychologists blame a lack of morality in an affluent generation over-exposed to violence in video games, television and comics.</p> <p>The prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, has pledged to introduce moral education in the country's schools and the government has established a panel of experts to consider ways to tackle youth crime, including stiffer penalties for juveniles.</p> <p>Nationalist political leaders, however, have blamed the immigrant population. Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara has warned that some areas of the capital are no longer safe after dark because of foreign gangsters.</p>",

  "Almost as troubling as the bomb which ripped through a pedestrian subway under Pushkin Square in Moscow during Tuesday's rush hour is the question of how President Vladimir Putin may respond. The atrocity, all the more appalling for the absence of any warning, was immediately, perhaps too immediately, blamed on the Chechens. <p>Almost exactly a year ago, a similar outrage in Red Square marked the beginning of a series of bomb attacks, mostly on apartment buildings, in which hundreds died. Mr Putin, only recently appointed prime minister by the then president Boris Yeltsin, used the ensuing revulsion to justify his launching of an all-out war of conquest in Chechnya. After uncounted deaths and immeasurable misery, Mr Putin declared victory and rode his conqueror's chariot to the Kremlin on the back of a presidential election landslide. </p> <p>But as forensic teams pick their way through the Pushkin Square d\u00e9bris, two points should be kept in mind. Despite strenuous efforts by Mr Putin's FSB security apparatus, Chechen responsibility for last year's terror campaign was never conclusively proved and, then as now, the Chechen leadership denied all involvement. And the Chechen \"victory\" that Mr Putin so skilfully exploited for electoral advantage was never entirely real. That conflict continues to this day. If the Chechens were behind Tuesday's blast, and especially if, as is feared, it marks the opening shot in a new urban terror campaign, the lie of Mr Putin's invincibility is exposed before the Russian people. If somebody else was responsible, he may feel even more threatened. </p> <p>Mr Putin has made a lot of enemies since taking office one year ago this week, any one of whom might wish to ruin his anniversary. They include, for example, nationalist elements within the federation (as in Tatarstan) and those in mainly Muslim former Soviet republics opposed to Mr Putin's central Asia \"Ostpolitik\". As Mr Putin warned yesterday against jumping to conclusions about who planted the bomb, some in Moscow predicted he could plunge into another, broad, swingeing law-and-order crackdown which could serve a wide multitude of purposes. Such a move would ostensibly be justified by a need to avenge the victims of Pushkin Square. But even if it fails to net the culprits, as was the case last year, Mr Putin will doubtless use it to ensure that his own position is further strengthened.</p>",
  "<p>The pimps and prostitutes of Yokohama City are used to being hassled by police officers and yakuza gangsters, but they may soon be shaken down by an altogether new face: the tax man. </p> <p>With local government revenues shrinking amid the worst recession in 50 years, the mayor of Yokohama, Hidenobu Takahide, has proposed the introduction of Japan's first sin tax, taking a cut from sex and gambling. </p> <p>Numerous obstacles - including red tape, opposition from organised crime syndicates and accusations of unfairness - need to be overcome, but the Yokohama plan is being closely watched by other Japanese municipalities, many of which are close to bankruptcy. </p> <p>Walk around Akebono-cho red light district, and it soon becomes clear why the sex industry is an obvious target in this port city. </p> <p>The main drag is lined with garishly coloured, neon-lit buildings with names like Princess Peach, The Pink House, and St Gospel School's Costume Play - all of which seem to be doing a better trade than conventional local firms. </p> <p>Many of these places are so-called fashion health establishments, which circumvent the prohibition on prostitution in Clinton style by offering only oral sex. </p> <p>It is a lucrative business. Signboards outside every door list prices ranging from about 7,000 to 15,000 yen (about \u00a344 to \u00a395) for 40 minutes, depending on the time of day, the age of the women and extras, such as dressing up as schoolgirls. Most places start at 10am and, according to local residents, have a steady stream of customers until the early hours of the morning. These businesses are supposed to pay about 43% of their profit in corporate tax - the same as any other private firm. Officials in the mayor's office say, however, that brothels and fashion health establishments usually doctor their accounts to ensure they pay next to nothing. </p> <p>All this will change if Mr Takahide has his way. The mayor has set up a panel to investigate ways to levy a new local tax on sex shops, betting offices and pachinko, or gambling machine, parlours. It is expected to announce its conclusions by the end of this year. </p> <p>\"Most local governments are in dire financial straits as welfare expenditures have increased while revenues have decreased,\" the mayor explained in a recent interview. \"To narrow the gap we need to increase revenues.\" </p> <p>Yokohama's tax income has fallen steadily over the past four years as local companies and residents have been hit by the recession. Last year, Japan's second most populous city received \u00a5667bn, or \u00a34.2bn in tax, down from \u00a5728bn in 1996. </p> <p>Meanwhile, it has had to pay more for health and social services to care for the growing number of elderly residents. It is a pattern that has been repeated across the country, leaving many municipalities in a worse state than Yokohama. </p> <p>As of April, local governments owed a staggering \u00a5179 trillion - just over \u00a31 trillion - in debt, more than Britain's entire annual output. </p> <p>The figure has almost tripled in the past 10 years. Seven prefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka, have declared financial crises. In good times, the main source of revenue for local governments is corporate tax, but two-thirds of Japan's companies are now losing money so they do not pay a single yen. </p> <p>Many municipalities rely on central government grants to stay solvent, but these could soon dry up. On Tuesday, a government panel recommended cutting subsidies to encourage local authorities to be more independent. </p> <p>Desperate for new income flows, Tokyo and Osaka - the country's two biggest and most indebted municipalities - have recently introduced new taxes on banks. This has been made possible by the implementation this year of a new local law which gives regional authorities more power over their finances. </p> <p>Despite criticism that the bank taxes unfairly punish a specific industry, they have strong public support because banks are widely blamed for Japan's economic problems. Yokohama's new sin tax seeks to tap into a similar sense of public indignation. \"Local people have requested action against the sex industry and a tax may be one way of reducing its presence in the city,\" said a senior official at the municipal tax office. \"Gambling joints and brothels also make a great deal of money so, under a progressive tax system, it is reasonable to charge them more.\" </p> <p>This will be easier said than done. Municipal officials are not sure how many sex establishments are doing business in the city, let alone their income. It is also hard to imagine that bureaucrats will push too hard to probe the finances of the yakuza crime syndicates that run such places. </p> <p>\"We cannot accept the new tax because it discriminates against us,\" said the crew-cut owner of the Yellow Cab health fashion business. \"Yokohama has screwed up its finances and now they're picking on us to cover their tab. Why should we co-operate?\" Even opponents of the sex industry have their doubts. \"This is just grandstanding aimed at gathering votes,\" said Hideo Akimoto, deputy chairman of the Akebono-cho residents association. </p> <p>\"They've no intention of cracking down on the sex trade. Political pressure will kill this plan because the police and the government are in the pockets of the mob. That's how this business was able to grow here in the first place.\" </p> <p>Economists' views are mixed. Critics say that a revision of the corporate tax system would be a more equitable and effective way of stabilising public finances than piecemeal levies on certain industries. Others, however, see the Yokohama moves as a possible test case. </p> <p>\"This shows how local governments are trying to find new ways to raise revenues,\" said Junzoh Wuemura of the Japan Centre for Economic Research. \"But putting this plan into action will be tough.\"</p>",
  "It is odd that the Conservative party seems to oppose the development of the distinctively British human rights culture which will follow from the Human Rights Act (Leader, August 9). For the first time, British courts will have to take account of human rights law. It follows logically that a body of British human rights jurisprudence will be created. <p>There are bound to be times when different rights are contested. But what is new - and welcome - is that this will happen in our courts and in parliament rather than just at Strasbourg. Far more of us will be able to contribute to a dialogue about rights, and play a part in shaping the type of human rights culture that we want to see in the UK. As the main opposition party, the Conservatives have an important role in this debate. </p> <p><b>Jenny Watson </b><br> Human Rights Act research unit, King's College </p> <p>\u0095 Julia Langdon is entitled to criticise me for views which I do hold but not for those which I do not (They just can't stand a successful working mum, August 9).

My own mother has worked for over 40 years. </p> <p> No one is suggesting that Cherie Blair should not work.

  "Plans to step up data matching - the comparison of sets of personal information held by different government agencies - could fall foul of the Human Rights Act, according to an official report published today. <p>The report, a consultation paper prepared by the public audit forum, said data matching could be useful to fight fraud and ensure that citizens received all benefits they were entitled to. But it admitted that the practice could threaten the right to privacy enshrined in article eight of the European convention on human rights. </p> <p>The convention is written into the Human Rights Act which comes into force on October 2. </p> <p>The report cited, as an example of data matching on a large scale, the audit commission's national fraud initiative to combat housing benefit fraud. The commission had identified about \u00a342m of fraud, \"showing that joined-up government works in this area\". </p> <p>In her latest annual report, Elizabeth France, data protection registrar, said proposals for increased data matching \"may well contravene\" the Human Rights Act \"because of lack of safeguards for individuals\". </p> <p>The threat posed by data matching was highlighted by the judge Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson before he was appointed a law lord: \"If the information obtained by the police, the inland revenue, the social security services, the health service and other agencies were to be gathered together in one file, the freedom of the individual would be gravely at risk... The dossier of private information is the badge of the totalitarian state.\"</p>",
  "\u0095It's early days, but a front-runner emerges for the Scoop of the Year title. Sunday Times readers have been introduced to a new member of the Campbell clan, and it's a very warm Diary helloooo! to Auntie Mairi Campbell. <p>Auntie crops up in a piece about the terrible drought on the Hebridean isle of Tiree. Och, never in her 45 years there has Auntie - pictured holding a glass of water she plans to boil for tea but dare not drink - known the like. Only in the last paragraph of this lengthy report do we hear of \"an end to the heatwave was finally in sight yesterday. Tiree awoke to mist and rain with showers forecast to continue for several days.\" Just like one of Bryan Appleyard's splendidly unpseudy pieces about the end of mankind, then, where he takes 23,000 words to mention that the drugs will go on working after all. Still, nice to meet Auntie Mairi, who looks a game old bird, and we hope to talk to her soon about forming Tiree's own Riviera Gigolo appreciation society. </p> <p>\u0095On the front page of the Times, meanwhile, comes that lovable perennial tale about the torrent of foreign \"health tourists\" invading the NHS. Bless them, has no one told them yet about first-world countries like France and Germany, which have modern equipment, intensive-care beds, competent surgeons and that sort of guff? Or is it, as I like to think, that these \"health tourists\" like to come here in the same nostalgic way that an Alan Bennett might prefer to eschew the luxury he can well afford for a holiday at the sort of B&amp;B that blighted his youth, just to bathe themselves in the warm waters of self- indulgent melancholy, in other words, even if it costs them their lives. </p> <p>\u0095This summer's second-most-alluring attraction is in the west country. Holiday makers in Devon are directed to Dunbury Road near Newton Abbot, where they will find the Hedgehog Hospital at Prickly Ball Farm.

Call 01626 362319 for further details - and then let us know all about it. Tomorrow, we have news of Britain's number one holiday hot spot. </p> <p>\u0095Thanks to Claire Chaney, who marks Gerald Kaufman Month with a memory from an August 1994 train trip for athletics fans from Helsinki to St Petersburg. \"We saw a familiar figure on the platform and asked him who he was. He was Gerald Kaufman. Imagine!\" Gosh. \"At the Russian border, we had to get off to change money. When Gerald got to the front of the queue, he cross-questioned the young lady about taxi fares in St Petersburg - how much, was the service any good, were the cars up to standard. He seemed to think she was his PA. We were astounded by this boorish display. I cannot think,\" Claire concludes, \"of any reason to love him.\" Bit harsh, Claire. Bit harsh. </p> <p> \u0095Today, meanwhile, we are collecting the Spitting Image Gerald from the London home of the show's producer, Roger Law, that soon-to-be-exhibiting artist.

If this outing is a success, there is every chance that a full national tour will eventually follow. </p> <p>\u0095Here's something for William Hague to ponder over his barrel of Old Thatch's Moist Gusset down the pub tonight. In Rio, Bernd Noveke has won a lawsuit against his former employer after claiming that his job as a beer taster turned him into an alcoholic. Mr Noveke told the court that he was forced to drink 13 to 17 daily pints - 14, we suspect - and the Brahma brewery was ordered to pay him $30,000 compensation and a $2,500 monthly pension. </p>",
  "More than 80 years after his death, the Native American known as \"the last wild man in north America\" will finally be laid to rest. <p>The brain of Ishi, which was held at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, has been returned this week to Native Americans in California for a secret burial in tribal grounds. </p> <p>The handover brings to an end a three-year campaign for the return of the brain, which had been kept for scientific research, to enable Ishi to be buried as he had wanted. </p> <p>Ishi - he never divulged his real name and was called by his dialect's word for man -walked out of the wilderness into Oroville in Butte County, northern California, in 1911. </p> <p>Then aged about 50, he was believed to be the last surviving member of the Yahis, who had numbered 20,000 a century earlier, before disease and massacres carried out by white settlers took their toll. </p> <p>Held in jail for a week, Ishi was later introduced to two anthropologists, Thomas Waterman and Alfred Kroeber, and helped them to transcribe his dialect at the Anthropology Museum attached to the University of California in San Francisco. </p> <p>He would demonstrate his weaving skills and sing in the museum and for a while was a sensational \"exhibit\" for San Franciscans who queued up to see him. </p> <p>He also worked as a caretaker at the nearby medical college, where he would help nurses clean their implements and sing to patients in his dialect. Recordings of his singing still exist. </p> <p>He was said to have been very keen that his language should be preserved and pressed the anthropologists to work harder on the project, possibly because he was aware that his time was short. </p> <p>Literature of the time describes him as someone of great dignity - he refused to pose stripped to the waist for photographers, choosing to wear the suit, shirt and tie he had been given. He enjoyed theatre and opera and had his own bank account. </p> <p>After five years in San Francisco he died, probably of TB, in March 1916. After witnessing post-mortem examinations, he made it clear that he did not want parts of his body removed. According to his religious beliefs, the soul could not enter into the next world with an incomplete body. </p> <p>Kroeber, who was not in San Francisco when Ishi died, initially supported his wishes but was over-ruled and later allowed the brain to be used for research purposes. At the time, eugenics was fashionable and it was believed that racial characteristics could be explained by brain size. </p> <p>The rest of Ishi's body was cremated, along with his bow and five of his arrows. His story has since become part of the school curriculum in California. </p> <p>The Butte County Native American Cultural Committee started to press for the return of the brain three years ago after it emerged that it might be held in the Smithsonian Institution. </p> <p>The institution found the brain in a jar, prompting moves to have it returned for tribal burial, as federal law now requires. </p> <p>This week the brain was returned to members of the Yana Native Americans, who had links with the Yahi. A secret burial on Mount Lassen, Ishi's ancestral home, will take place shortly. </p> <p>Larry Myers of the Californian Native American heritage committee said: \"It's about time. This should never have happened.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Blown back to the fun of the arcades</strong></p> <p><strong> Silent Bomber</strong><br> Sony PlayStation \u00a329.99 Bandai/Virgin<br> Something of a misnomer, that title: the main character, Jutah Fate, is most definitely a bomber, but silent he ain't. At least we've moved away from the \"Atavistic Bomb Panjandrum\" school of Japanese game-naming. Fate's mission - should you choose to care, which is not recommended - is to destroy the command ship of his evil former boss. </p> <p>Using two wrist-mounted bomb launchers, you direct Fate to blow up everything that moves, and everything that doesn't, for a laugh. There are four types of bomb (standard, gravity, paralysis and napalm), and several ways of using them: drop them on the floor, stick them on the wall, lock them on to a target, stack them, use them in devastating combinations. </p> <p>If this all sounds a little daunting, the control system is surprisingly easy to pick up. </p> <p>Silent Bomber is a return to the golden days of the arcade: end-of-level bosses, health bars, wafer-thin plot, even high score tables. This, combined with its simple, frantic, compulsive gameplay, will have you reaching for a 10p piece every time your man goes down. </p> <p>And thanks to the legions of re-spawning baddies and Gauntlet-style monster generators, go down he will, repeatedly. (If this was a coin-op, it would set you back a fortune.) But the explosions are so natty, the sound effects so beefy and the rumbles on the Rumblepak so rumbly, that you even get a kick out of kicking the bucket. </p> <p>The action seems a little far off at times, as the isometric view is set way above Fate's head; but the graphics always remain smooth and, more importantly, crystal clear. </p> <p>For sheer originality, Silent Bomber is well worth a blast. (AB)</p> <p> <strong> Killer android strikes gold</strong></p> <p><strong> Deus Ex</strong><br> PC \u00a344.99 Eidos/Ion Storm<br> It is dark, raining, and you are an android in a futuristic urban cliche. Yup, Blade Runneritis - the disease that affects 80% of all computer game scriptwriters - has struck again. But maybe we shouldn't mind too much when this latest casualty is such a genre-bending success. Deus Ex mixes Quake, Thief, and Baldur's Gate to produce one of the finest PC games for years. </p> <p>Initially such hyperbole seems misplaced. The perfunctory graphics are underwhelming as you sneak off towards a headless Statue of Liberty, hugging the shadows in pure Thief style. </p> <p>Kill a guard or two, causing all hell to break loose, and watch all the Quake fans switch off. With ammo scarce and the guards particularly intelligent, simple blasting will get you nowhere. </p> <p>However, perseverance is amply rewarded as the game evolves from simple first-person shooter into a time consuming obsession. </p> <p>This is mainly due to two factors: freedom and character building. The RPG (role-playing game) elements are surprisingly flexible, allowing you to update your android bodily parts quickly and easily, without all the normal jargon. Also, even more than its console sibling, Perfect Dark, Deus Ex gives you the freedom to decide. </p> <p>Kill an unarmed terrorist leader? Or let him live and face the career consequences. Essentially you can play through as peacefully or as violently as you want. </p> <p>Occasional AI glitches and dubious voice acting detract, though even the formulaic cyberpunk story engrosses, with plenty for conspiracy theorists to mull over. </p> <p>It also makes you wonder why most game developers simply re-heat Quake when they could be cooking up new recipes like this.
