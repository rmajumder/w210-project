  "<p>The following reviews aim to give a rough guide to just a few of the many short film sites out there. Content and sites change; our reviewers' comments are what they found when they visited the sites during September 2000. All sites were tested on PCs and and macs and with both dial-up modem and broadband connections. We welcome your comments, and if you would like us to review your site, please email us at film.feedback@guardianunlimited.co.uk.</p> <p>Reviews by Kate Stables, Sean Dodson, Emma Yates and Imogen Tilden.</p> <p><a href=\"http://panushka.absolutvodka.com/\">Absolut Panushka</a><br>An online experimental animation festival that featured 32 films in 1998. Still live, still worth a look - in spite of all the films being about a very famous brand of Swedish vodka.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.afilmcinado.net/\">afilmcinado.net</a><br>A well-intentioned but sparsely stocked \"alternative\" site, which was concentrating largely on German shorts at our last glance. Horribly slow downloads (even with a broadband connection) meant that we couldn't gauge how trippy Irish thriller The Trip was intended to be. RealPlayer and QuickTime options are offered, but be prepared for a unhealthy wait between clicking and viewing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.alwaysindependentfilms.com/\">always independent</a><br>A good selection of independent movies from minute-long shorts to full-length features. Also includes a classic film section that - if you have the patience - streams old black and whites like The Three Stooges' Brideless Groom and Chaplin's The Gold Rush. You'll need a Windows Media Player to see the majority of them (sorry, mac users).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.atomfilms.com/browsersafe/\">AtomFilms</a><br>Probably the most famous and most visited short film site on the Web. Atom's comprehensive choice and popular content make it a good place to learn what you enjoy - and what you want to avoid - in the world of webfilm. Roam all over this vast and varied site, to sample work running from Oscar nominated shorts, through festival favourites and foreign films, to \"extreme\" interactive animations. To see more than featured picks requires registration as an Atom Insider, which is free and doesn't (to date) result in a tsunami of junk email. All streaming video formats are catered for. Gadget freaks can have shorts sent to their personal digital organizer or WAP phone, to stun the bus queue.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bijoucafe.com/\">Bijou Cafe</a><br>Movie lovers with a taste for kitsch cinema will love this site - as long as they have access to a superfast connection. Bijou Cafe stream old feature-length movies from Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in Horror Express to transvestite classic Glen or Glenda.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.binarytheater.com/\">BinaryTheater</a><br>A cheerful American single page site with half a dozen titles, all under 15 minutes. Its raison d'\u00eatre is to give free, unlimited distribution to the best work from US film schools. We'd guess that the cream of US film school shorts pour headlong onto higher-profile sites like Atom and IFilm, but if you have a RealVideo plugin, this is worth a quick look.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thebitscreen.com/\">The Bit Screen<br></a>Convince yourself that the web is the next broadcast medium, by stopping in at The Bit Screen. Owner Nora Barry has a messianic interest in first run web-specific work, and this is the place to pick up on interactive artistic novelties like self-assembly webfilms. Look out for Random Shuffles - films programmed to reconfigure for each successive site visitor. Succulent animations were programmed when we visited, including Billy Blob's stylised satire Darwin Bug. Four works are featured every week, which can be viewed using Shockwave or RealPlayer, but there's no on-site archive</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.campchaos.com/\"><br>Camp Chaos</a><br>Cartoonist Bob Cesca's web HQ, and home to his set of energetic, taste-free Flash cartoon series, which are updated weekly. Lovers of American \"extreme content\" animation will fall giggling onto his topical spoofs, but we preferred Mafia series This Thing of Ours. Browse through Public Domain Theater, which marries cheesy black and white B-movie footage with parody voiceover, should you have the time. If you can't hear anything, check you've updated your Flash plugin.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.culturejam.com/\">Culturejam</a><br>Culturejam is that counter-culture curiosity, a site dedicated to streaming subversive media to the masses. A welcome shot of guerilla media is delivered in a single RealPlayer short film, highlighting the issue of the week. Sticking it to the military-industrial complex when we showed up was the mind-expander's manifesto Mother May I ? (Control My Own Consciousness). There's no film archive on site, so counter-media connoisseurs will need to demonstrate solidarity by regular attendance.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dfilm.com/\"><br>D.Film</a><br>Now grown up from its diminutive indie roots into a fully fledged festival and supporting website, D.film picks one film a month to showcase. Recent highlights include an excerpt from The Week Before, a beautiful, slow-moving silent movie about God in the seven days before he created the earth, and Mutate, by British director Jack Price. Each film offers you the option of downloading it or watching it via streaming QuickTime.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.directorunknown.com/\"><br>Director Unknown</a><br>Using a Dogme '95-style manifesto to create a \"movie of the web\", six young American film-makers have put together a fresh but flakey 12-episode RealPlayer thriller on this site. Each short episode was shot in a day by a member of the collective, and sometimes - inevitably - it shows. Watch their Lynchian streamed video in episode order, using a broadband connection if at all possible.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.evanmather.com/html/index0.html\">Evan Mather</a><br>The delightful and diverse offerings of prolific short film-maker Evan Mather, packed into a single page site, both Mac and PC-friendly. He made his name with surreal Star Wars parodies like Les Pantless Menace, one of a series of lo-tech spoofs stuffed with plastic figurines and disco soundtracks. If these crowd-pleasers leave you cold, try out his funky, rough-edged animations, such as Fansom The Lizard. An excellent antidote to the plague of one-joke Flash cartoons that friends insist on cramming into your email inbox with.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.flashfilmfestival.com/\"><br>Flash Film Festival</a><br>The showcase site for New York's July 2000 Flash Film Festival, which \"honoured the best motion graphics and animation on earth\". Although the festival has been and gone, you can still roam through the 10 categories (including design, 3D, interactivity, cartoons), and check out the five finalists. The games section is particularly good fun - we liked Assassinate A Celebrity and Chicken Killer. But the navigation can be confusing and, when we looked, some of the pages weren't accessible. Overall the site is well designed and good fun though.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www1.getoutthere.bt.com/\">Get Out There</a><br>Fresh, unvarnished first-time film-making is BT's site's selling-point. When we visited, we found a choice of 116 lively QuickTime film shorts and animations, some more highly-polished than others. Since films automatically gather points when they are visited - rather than voted for - you may find the Top 10 charts longer on novelty than quality. Jewels like Chris Titchborne's Tommy Grimbald or couch potato cautionary tale Horsehair can be found lower down the listings, with a bit of digging. We liked the Least Popular Films chart option, with its very British appeal for lovers of lame-dog cinema.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hahabonk.com/\">hahabonk</a><br>Holy arse-kicking ecclesiasticals! Undisputed star of this likeably laddish British comedy site is the animated series The Cloth, which owes more to the comic book than the Good Book. We also liked Sickboys Pocket Cinema for animated 30-second versions of movie classics, all sicker than Linda Blair on a cross-channel ferry. You'll need RealPlayer and Flash plugins to access the site, and patience for the excruciatingly slow downloads on normal modems.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.heavy.com/\">Heavy.com</a><br>Superfunky, laid-back site that gives you the choice of \"slim\" or \"fat\" modem speeds before unleashing its hip hop-tinged content on yo' ass. Predominantly music and TV-based, there's a wonderful pastiche of Behind the Music called Behind the Music That Sucks, deriding superstars such as Barbra Streisand and Billy Joel. You can get seriously distracted in the 'Contagious' section (\"it's probably in your inbox already\"), which is full of those annoying 20-second clips of disgruntled office workers going ape. Too chilled out for any type of mission statement, the site works on a pin-and-blindfold style of navigation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lalive.com/hollywoodshorts/\"><br>Hollywood Shorts</a><br>Aims to provide emerging directors, writers, and producers the means of showing their short films and videos. Three or four films are showcased on the site each month, as well as screened at a cinema in Los Angeles. It's the closest to cinema film yet: each short lasts up to 40 minutes, but navigation is simple and a choice of modem speed is available for each film. Painful indeed for those of us without broadband access, but worth paying attention to in the future.</p> <p><a href=\"http://hotwired.lycos.com/animation/\"><br>HotWired: Animation Express</a><br>We haven't been so excited by a rectangular window since watching Playschool. Look into this site to catch a fine selection of glossy animation in vast, glitch-free video windows. Pick anything you fancy off the front-page carousel - it's all pretty damn good frankly. We were taken with arty fare like The Last Hula Doll, as well as the enjoyably perverse Sex Slave Series , whose plotlines do indeed \"mesh like a well-oiled orgy\". There is big name content too, from Joe Corrao and Pixar Studios. Flash, Shockwave and QuickTime plugins required, all of which are available onsite.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hypnotic.com/flashdetect.asp\">Hypnotic</a><br>Seasoned webfilm seekers may remember this site as Reelshort, before its acquisition by Universal Pictures. Now reborn as 'new media film studio' Hypnotic, the site boasts a glossy new look and a significantly sharper range of films. All the usual hype-dodging rules still apply however - try and avoid ballyhooed spoofs (like The Sick Sense) and have a rummage in the channels. We approved thoroughly of Hypnotic's line in bizarre or experimental work such as Nude Descending and Crawley. Oh, and don't forget to sample their popular and wonderfully offensive episodic series Rick and Steve, the Happiest Gay Couple In All the World .</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.icebox.com/\">Icebox</a><br>Another Flash animation site that boasts that this is independent film-making with \"no rules, no filters, no studio executives.\" And while its Hidden Celebrity Webcam is an admirable spoof, Icebox too often ladles up a series of episodic shorts that all can suffer from being more than a little juvenile. Still, the cartoons are well drawn and the site is admirably organised.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ifilm.com/\">ifilm</a><br>Claims, not unjustifiably, to be the best place for internet film. ifilm certainly is one of the best starting points for newcomers, part portal - offering links to other webfilms and sites - and part independent - commissioning and screening shorts of its own. Films are divided thematically, the running time is listed for each, and most offer the choice of viewing media. The navigation is clear and easy and user review options complete an impressively rounded picture.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jibjab.com/\"><br>JibJab</a><br>This New York-based Flash cartoon site was only established in November 1999, but has already won a host of industry awards. Dedicated to \"producing original entertainment for online channels\", the Spiridelli brothers have created a host of animated characters such as Nasty Santa, Hoola Boy and the farting waffle. Although some of the humour is a tad adolescent, the Interactive Rapping President is a wonder to behold. mac and pc users both should have no problems.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mediatrip.com/\">Mediatrip</a><br>Sharp and successful spoofs have been the engine behind the growth of this quickwitted American entertainment site. Home of web parody hits like audience-charmer George Lucas in Love, MediaTrip also turns up occasional gems in other genres: award-winning fantasy Sentinelle hooked our interest when we ploughed through the Top 10 on your behalf. Sophisticates shouldn't miss Lil' Pimp, the freckle-faced tot who puts the 'ho in \"ho-ho-ho\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newvenue.com/index2.html\">The New Venue</a><br>Set up in 1996 by Jason Wishnow, the \"enfant terrible of digital film\", this was the first site dedicated to movies made expressly for the internet. It's for digital film-makers as much as desktop film viewers: one film is highlighted as the weekly feature, with an extensive back archive, and the Flick Tips section is a must for wannabe film-makers giving detailed advice on how to make your own digital film. If you've been paying attention, you can submit your own work for consideration. A great starting point to the whole medium; this site won't make you feel completely overwhelmed.</p> <p>Pitch TV<br>A New York-based site that collects poetic animations and short films mostly from southern Europe and latin America. Each short is either dubbed or subtitled and the films are shown in a pop-up box courtesy of Macromedia Flash. There is a notable world movie e-zine to accompany the films. But it is the shorts that are of most interest here. They are, quite literally, poetry in motion.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thequickie.com/\">The Quickie</a><br>Small but perfectly formed animation site. Terming itself \"one of the internet's premiere cartoon animation sites\", the navigation is simple, and the site's sense of humour is evident on every page. Don't miss the Star Wars - Episode 9, a prize winner in the World Entertainment Animation animated comedy / parody category. Han Solo has become a Travis Bickle-type figure, while Luke uses the force to move papers from the in to the out tray at work in the Jedi corporation. mac and pc-friendly.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.reelscreen.com/\">Reel Screen</a><br>reelscreen sensibly offer just five \"highest rated\" and \"new film\" picks apiece on the film page of this smart British site. Which steered us straight to the best of their holdings, studded with goodies like feverish festival fave Nite Owl, and Jester, Nick Herbert's accomplished medieval animation. We suggest you stick to the chart path, unless you have the urge, the time and the stamina to work through their diverse archive, whose film listings can be unhelpfully bald.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.shortfest.com/\">ShortFest</a><br>Those serious about shorts should bookmark this ingenious American site, which employs a festival format with seasonal changes of programme. ShortFest is made up of five thoughtful strands of US and international short film programming, each themed and guest-curated by an industry specialist. When we checked in, Moira Griffin's Telling Tales strand had gems such as Jim Trainor's pencil scrawled picaresque, Bats. Some films can run as long as 25-40 minutes, so use the programme notes to plan your viewing. Currently only available in QuickTime and RealPlayer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sputnik7.com/\">sputnik7</a><br>Drop-dead cool US entertainment site and haven for lovers of Japanese \"anime\" film. Those happy few with broadband and unmetered access can find a continuous programme of short films and full length anime features such as Orguss 02, on video channel 7.04. The rest of us steer our way to the modish video-on-demand choices, which run in RealPlayer or Windows Media Player. If you wish to browse the archives, you'll need to register as a site user.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.c-cat.demon.co.uk/theatre/\">The Surrey Stick Figure Theatre of Death</a><br>An oldie but goldie, which dates from the web's prelapsarian period but is still commanding a devoted following for its weekly releases. David Thorpe's sly stick-figure massacres are 10-second masterpieces of black humour and comic timing. Thumb through the vast archive to find Theatre of Death classics like The Surrealist and Hamlet, or sample cinema spoofs like Pulp Sticktion. Severed-head-and-shoulders above similar sites, in our opinion.</p> <p><a href=\"http://cherry.switch2.net/index\">Switch2.net</a><br>A good-looking UK general entertainment site, with a grabby come-hither animated interface. SHORTS, their film channel, turns out to be fewer than 10 - albeit classy - choices of film. Australian director Monica Pellizari's quirky Just Desserts, and a winning selection from the Rushes Soho Shorts Festival 2000 were on offer when we visited. For such a user-friendly site, the lack of film timings and the provision of matchbook-sized viewing windows are an unnecessary irritant.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.undergroundfilm.com/\"><br>Undergroundfilm.com</a><br>Not as alternative as its name might suggest. Still, it offers up a well-chosen archive of 180 independent shorts (mostly American), with a fair selection of artistic film, plus one bizarre experimental animated series, the macabre Braingirl. Dive straight into the handful of rotating Editor's Film Picks on the home page, to avoid the fiddly list-based navigation system. We hit lucky with Flucht, an atmospheric monochrome thriller following one man and his paranoia around a small German town. QuickTime 4 only here, but the site's spacious video windows and crisp images may well be worth the download time to acquire it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.urbandesires.com/\">Urban Desires</a><br>Primarily an online magazine, this is a stylish site that also showcases the work of new directors. There is good supplementary material including interviews with the directors and an archive of previously shown work. It looks great, but the almost total lack of comprehensive navigation makes it a frustrating experience.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.urbanentertainment.com/\">Urban Entertainment</a><br>This hip, black-themed entertainment site has a breakout hit on its hands in animated blaxploitation spoof series Undercover Brother. Though the compact short film section has its moments - try Charles Stone's goofy True for size - we found that animated series like the raucous Pookie Poo were the real finds. Graphic-novel enthusiasts will also want to check out moody adult animated thriller The Contract. Gratifyingly fast daytime downloads, provided you've got Flash or RealPlayer.</p>",

  "<p>It is widely acknowledged that Ronnie Irani is in the best form of his career with both bat and ball. Certainly Glamorgan will testify to that - and not because of this match. </p> <p>In June Cardiff was the scene of a nine-hour, career-best 168 not out. On this occasion he was not so productive, falling five short of his century, but he nevertheless produced an innings of immense value to guide his county away from a precipice. </p> <p>Paul Grayson, Paul Prichard and Will Jefferson, the 20-year-old debutant, had departed within the opening five overs with only 13 on the board when a purposeful Irani strode out to join Stuart Law. </p> <p>He announced his arrival by finding the boundary with his first three scoring strokes and, together with the Australian, was to prise the initiative away from the Welsh county as quickly as they had seized it. </p> <p>Three successive fours by Law raised the 50 in the 12th over and the total moved into three figures at the rate of just under five an over. By then Irani had become more passive and was content to watch Law dictate with some effortless driving off the front foot. </p> <p>Law looked in such control that it came as something of a surprise when, driving on the up, he dispatched Robert Croft to mid-on having scored 70 in 92 deliveries, 10 of which were boundaries. </p> <p>Irani's response was to drive Croft straight for six to complete his half-century and he continued to ease the ball into the gaps until he was given out lbw when pushing forward to the slow left-armer Dean Kosker. Thereafter James Foster, another 20-year-old debutant, showed fine composure to score 52 before the return of Steve Watkin breached his forward push. </p> <p>Faced with a target of 292, Glamorgan responded with 40 before the close for the loss of Steve James. He scored 309 not out in his previous championship outing but had made only a modest 30 when his stumps were disturbed by Ashley Cowan - but not before he had scored his 1,000th run of the summer.</p>",
  "British ministers demanded action from their French counterparts today after thousands of holiday makers and hauliers were left stranded by the French fishermen's blockade of Channel ports. <p>Traffic eventually started moving again by mid-afternoon after fishermen called off their action and the blockaded French ports reopened. The stalemate ended after the Paris government agreed to reduce the price of fuel.</p> <p>Deputy prime minister John Prescott told the French government that the impact of the industrial action was \"unacceptable\" and British hauliers demanded compensation for the huge disruption to cross-Channel travel. The cost to British industry of the protest against high French fuel prices was estimated at \u00a35m, in addition to the inconvenience caused to British holiday makers left queuing for hours to get home from France. Earlier there were angry scenes at the Channel tunnel's Calais terminal as Britons tried to clear the barricades. </p> <p>Travel companies warned it would be hours before services returned to normal, while police said jams on the M20 in Kent on the way to Dover were likely to continue. </p> <p>In the port of Le Havre, more than 740 Portsmouth-bound passengers had to spend Wednesday night and Thursday morning aboard a P&amp;O vessel, the Pride of Le Havre, after fishermen, who started their blockade early, prevented the ship from leaving. The vessel was finally able to sail from Le Havre early this afternoon and was due to dock at Portsmouth tonight. </p> <p>Huge queues of lorries had built up outside Dover and at the ports hit by the dispute - Calais, Cherbourg, Dunkirk, Le Havre and St Malo. </p> <p>Ferry companies put on extra services to French and Belgian ports unaffected by the dispute. Channel Tunnel shuttle train services between Folkestone and Calais were running, but passengers had trouble getting through the protesters to reach the trains. </p> <p>The UK ports hit by the effect of the blockades in France were Dover, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Poole. Ferry companies P&amp;O Stena Line, SeaFrance, Norfolk Line, Brittany Ferries, and P&amp;O Portsmouth were all affected. </p> <p>In a letter to French transport minister Jean-Claude Gayssot today, Mr Prescott said the action of protesting fishermen was contrary to EU legislation. </p> <p>He went on: \"The action is unacceptable to us. Stranded road hauliers on both sides of the Channel stand to lose millions of pounds. </p> <p>\"The actions of the protesters are contrary to EU legislation on the free movement of goods and will badly tarnish the image of France in Britain.\" </p> <p>Simon Murphy, the Labour leader in the European parliament, wrote to EU transport commission Loyola de Palacio demanding compensation for UK holiday makers caught up in the dispute. </p> <p>Mr Murphy said: \"Back in 1997, the European court ruled that countries must prevent such obstructions to trade or they would be fined. But the French government still allows them to go on. </p> <p>\"This is no way to run a modern Europe which depends on the free trade and free movement of people.\" </p>",
  "<p>The consolidation spree within ITV is spurring news service ITN and digital terrestrial platform ONdigital's flotation plans.</p> <p>Both are companies owned by key network players. Executives at Granada Media and Carlton Communications, the main shareholders in both companies, are poised to draw up initial public offering options. ONdigital is at the most advanced stage towards a stock market listing.</p> <p>ONdigital is trailing rival BSkyB and the tussle for control of ITV between its joint owners has prevented a flotation that would boost funding for its expansion plans. However, Granada's \u00a31.75bn deal for United News &amp; Media's TV franchises has re-opened the possibility of an IPO.</p> <p>The plans are complicated by Granada's ownership of the HTV franchise, which it must sell to satisfy regulators following the United acquisition. Granada chairman Charles Allen is aware of counterpart Michael Green's interest in HTV and could upset negotiations by selling the franchise to another party.</p> <p>An ITN flotation is still at the early stages of development, as a lot hinges on what Granada does with its holding in the company. No company can hold more than 20% of the news service, which is co-owned by Granada, Carlton, Reuters, the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust and United. It means Granada has to dispose of the stake it inherited from United or sell the shares to the public.</p> <p>The proceeds from an ITN public offering would be used to fund the company's internet ambitions and boost its international services. However, it is possible that the sale of Granada's stake will provide enough money to finance its plans. Analysts put ITN's full IPO value at between \u00a3200m and \u00a3300m.</p> <p>Merill Lynch analyst Neil Blackley said: \"The money available from the Granada stake is not primary money, so it would probably have to be made available through an IPO. In terms of the whole organisation, though, ITN is a perfectly viable IPO and an excellent company.\" </p> <p>On August 30, Granada's share price fell 5.25p to 670.75p, with Carlton climbing 26p to 726p. </p>",
  "<p>In tune</p> <p>Woolwich's current campaign includes an ad featuring a customer closing his bank account because he's not had the service he wanted. The ad's focus?

  "<p>ITV fired an agressive salvo in the soap opera ratings war yesterday with the announcement of a rival to EastEnders and a revival of Crossroads. Giving the nation a new generation of gay fathers, power-bitches and angst-ridden teenagers to idolise, ITV said it would \"stuff the BBC\" in the popular drama battleground. </p> <p>Trafalgar Road, a tea time series based on a group of friendly-but-flawed families, is a high risk attempt to create the network's first London-based soap - the heartland dominated by the BBC's ratings winner, EastEnders. </p> <p>At the same time, Crossroads has shed the shaky sets and dodgy scripts of its 70s incarnation in a makeover promoted by Lord Alli, director of production at Carlton, part of a drive to revive ITV's afternoon schedule. </p> <p>Both series, costing \u00a340,000 an episode, will run for at least a year, five days a week. </p> <p>They are among the biggest risks taken by ITV's director of programmes, David Liddiment, since he took over in 1997. </p> <p>Like Lord Alli's new Labour party, new Crossroads will bear only a passing resemblance to the original. </p> <p>While there is a part for Jane Rossington, the actress who opened the first episode in 1964 with the immortal lines \"Crossroads motel, can I help you?\", there is no room for the idiot savant of the original series, Benny Hawkins. Producers have decided that his simple but lovable character is not suitable for a 21st century audience. </p> <p>Rossington's character, Jill Chance, will stage a dramatic return from the West Country to claim a stake in the business. A power battle ensues with new owner Kate Russell, who may be played by one half of the Dempsey and Makepeace cop show duo, Glynis Barber. There will be a new, glamorous receptionist to replace Miss Diane, and a hunky young porter to complete the sexier line-up. </p> <p>Steve Hewlett, Carlton's director of programmes, said the remake would not suffer from the wobbly sets and incredible storylines that plagued the later stages of the original show. \"It won't have any of those defects. This has fantastic storylines and very high production values.\" </p> <p>Old fans would recognise some elements. Kathy Staff, who played the gossipy cleaner and kitchen worker, Doris Luke, is earmarked for a comeback. But new viewers would not suffer from a lack of background knowledge. \"While it is not afraid of its roots, it will work as a new drama in its own right,\" Mr Hewlett said. </p> <p>Trafalgar Road, made by United Productions, will fill the tea time slot vacated by Home and Away, poached by Channel 5. It is described as less gritty and depressing than EastEnders: \"It's deeply moral, sweet and funny, but has a strong thriller element,\" said the show's executive producer, Damien Timmer. </p> <p>It is based around the Harper, Wells, Drake and Mills families: Mike Drake is a middle aged father struggling with his homosexuality, just as his 16-year-old son Tim is going through his own teenage rite of passage with Frankie Mills, the girl next door. </p> <p>Further dramatic tension is provided by a handsome young footballer, Sam Hayden: the 17-year-old must choose between his dream of a dazzling career with Charlton Athletic, where he is on the youth team, and bringing up his baby brother and young sister following the death of his parents. </p> <p>Mr Liddiment said the commissions were substantial investments in UK drama. \"Soaps play an important role in connecting channels with their audience. </p> <p>\"In a multi-channel age, I believe their ability to create 'appointments to view' in the schedule will be even more crucial.\" </p> <p><strong>Dud suds: Soaps that failed</strong></p> <p><strong> Eldorado</strong> <br>Launched in 1992 by the team that created EastEnders, it soon fell victim to tabloid vilification. It was launched too quickly and with little imagination, less investment. Not even the southern Spain location could save it.</p> <p><strong> Albion Market</strong> <br>ITV's Manchester answer to EastEnders suffered from bizarre scheduling - Friday to Sunday. Patchy commitment from some ITV regions signed its death warrant.</p> <p><strong> Families </strong> <br>Short-lived daily offering from Granada. David Liddiment, ITV director of programmes, then based at the Manchester broadcaster, learned many lessons from its failure, including the key \"keep it simple\" premise. Families was partly based in Sydney, and the global storylines were just too far-fetched. </p> <p><strong> London Bridge</strong> <br>It has to be hoped that Carlton's first attempt at a soap is not replicated in Crossroads. The London-based drama never took off outside the capital, and was axed in 1996, a year after its launch. </p> <p><strong> Family Affairs</strong> <br>Channel 5's attempt at a daily soap suffered from the Crossroads curse of acting even more wooden than the sets. Mass cull of main characters aimed to save it. Still on the air, but some would question why.</p>",
  "<p>They are fresh faced twenty-somethings who wear combat trousers to work and dream about making a fast buck while burning vast sums of someone else's venture capital. </p> <p>At least that is what we thought dot.com entrepreneurs were supposed to be. </p> <p>New research from KPMG Consulting suggests that the identikit \"e-business leader\" is actually a far more sober-suited type. Typically aged 38, he often works seven days a week, has little time for a social life and is more likely to be found travelling economy class on a budget airline than the business class of a longer established carrier. </p> <p>And nine out of 10 dot.com directors say they would wear a traditional suit to an important meeting because casual dress was \"inappropriate\". </p> <p>The report, E-Business Leaders Survey 2000, paints dot.com directors in a far more flattering light than the publicity many in cyberspace have attracted after high-profile failures by the likes of Boo.com. </p> <p>\"Most people think that dot.coms are run by young graduates, who make loads of money in a short space of time,\" said Alan Buckle, chief executive of KPMG Consulting UK. \"The dot.com leaders we surveyed work hard and are extremely dedicated - they are not kids, playing at business and hoping to make a fast buck. </p> <p>\"The research shows that there really is no short cut to success in the new economy. Just like a traditional business, a net venture will only thrive thanks to the hard work and business sense of its people. </p> <p>\"But there are critical differences in how dot.com leaders work that are increasingly likely to spread to the rest of the UK plc - particularly the focus on keeping costs to a minimum and the changing work patterns that reflect the 24/7 culture of the internet world.\" </p> <p>KPMG interviewed 101 executives and found several differences between dot.com and traditional company working patterns. The biggest gap is in the median annual company turnover of the two groups: for traditional businesses it was \u00a3860m, for internet firms just \u00a3750,000. </p> <p>Despite the gap both groups worked more than 56 hours a week on average. Directors of internet firms are twice as likely as traditional directors to work 71 hours per week and 40% are still in the office after 8pm. </p> <p>More than a third said they have little time to relax or socialise and when they do take time out to read a book almost half read business books rather than fiction. On average dot.com directors take less than half of their annual holiday entitlement. </p> <p>Internet directors are less likely to have degrees or backgrounds in finance but more have had private educations and come from marketing backgrounds. </p> <p>The average age of the two groups of directors was much closer than researchers expected. Although 10 times as many dot.com directors were under 30 than those in traditional businesses, the average age of executives at new economy firms was an older than expected 38. The average age of old economy business leaders was 46. </p> <p>What motivates each group also threw up some interesting results. Dot.com directors cited the chance to grow a business from scratch, working in a young, dynamic environment and stock options as the three biggest motivating factors. Old economy directors say they are turned on most by stock options and high salaries. </p> <p>When it comes to dressing for work, 82% of dot.com executives favour permanent dress down days but nine out of 10 will put on a suit for an important business meeting. Eight out of 10 old economy bosses wear suits every day. </p> <p>Nearly half of all executives plan to retire by the time they are 60 but almost 15% of e-business leaders love work so much they do not plan to hang over the reigns until they are 70. </p> <p> <strong> The dot.com executive...</strong> </p> <p>Average age 38 </p> <p>Prefers casual clothes </p> <p>Twice as likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous </p> <p>More likely to have a private education </p> <p>Less likely to have a degree </p> <p>Background in marketing or IT </p> <p>Willing to take risks </p> <p>Works very long hours </p> <p>Rarely goes out </p> <p>Travels infrequently and flies economy </p> <p>Admires Richard Branson </p> <p>Would love an Audi TT </p> <p>Dreams of being a pilot </p> <p>Retirement age varies from 30-70 </p> <p><strong> The traditional executive...</strong> </p> <p>Average age 46 </p> <p>Prefers to wear a suit </p> <p>More than likely to be right-handed </p> <p>Likely to have been to grammar school </p> <p>Probably with a degree </p> <p>Finance background </p> <p>Relies on personal ability </p> <p>Works business hours </p> <p>Takes more holiday </p> <p>Travels often, flies first class or business </p> <p>Admires Bill Gates </p> <p>Would love a Jaguar XK8 </p> <p>Dreams of being a novelist </p> <p>Plans to retire at a more traditional age</p>",
  "<p><strong>August 25 2000:</strong> Dyke used the MacTaggart Lecture, the keynote speech at the Guardian Edinburgh international television festival, to outline a future vision for the BBC based on the principle of \"universality\" - making all the corporation's publicly funded services available in all homes. He added that in the digital era the BBC's single most important role will be to make \"great British programmes\".</p> <p>He said universality meant the BBC will limit itself to seven licence fee-funded TV services on five channels - the maximum that could fit on the BBC's digital terrestrial multiplex and be available free to all digital TV viewers.</p> <p>The services, Dyke said, would include a BBC1 focused on delivering \"greater impact\", but without banishing all current affairs, documentaries, religion and arts. Dyke also announced that the BBC planned to move its 9pm news to 10pm from 2001. </p> <p>BBC2, he added, would take some shows from BBC1 and become the channel for \"intelligent specialist factual\", leisure and lifestyle, \"thoughtful analysis, creatively ambitious drama and comedy, and specialist sports\".</p> <p>But Dyke said this gradual transformation would take years, maybe until after analogue switch-off - estimated to take place towards the end of the decade. He added that BBC1 and BBC2 would continue to be aimed at analogue viewers, who are expected to make up the majority of TV homes until at least 2003.</p> <p>BBC Choice would be transformed into youth-oriented service BBC3; while BBC Knowledge was to become BBC4, \"a mixture of Radios 3 and 4 on television\". The other services would be News 24 and two children's services, aimed at pre-school and six to 13-year-olds, which will go out on BBC3 and 4 during the daytime.</p> <p>Dyke also announced that the BBC would be spending an extra \u00a3480m on programmes and services within two years - a 30% increase in real terms over three years. More than half the extra money will be spent on BBC1 and 2, with BBC3 and 4 having a combined budget of \u00a3130m and the Nations and Regions getting an extra \u00a350m.</p> <p><strong>August 7:</strong> BBC lobbying was reported to have persuaded the government not to abolish the board of governors. But the BBC governors are expected to have their powers curtailed and be made to report to a single independent regulator that will be created to oversee the broadcasting industry.</p> <p> <strong>August 6: </strong>The Sunday Times reported that Greg Dyke was planning to use his MacTaggart speech at the Edinburgh TV festival to unveil plans to reposition BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge as BBC3 and BBC4. The newspaper reported that BBC3 would be relaunched in April 2001 as a youth channel with a \u00a392m annual budget. BBC4, which is to be repositioned as a high-brow arts, science and politics channel, is expected to have a \u00a350m budget. Dyke was said to have discussed his plans with the BBC governors during their monthly meeting in July and to have described BBC4 as a \"virtual Tate Modern\".</p> <p><strong>July 13:</strong> In his first appearance before the Commons media select committee as director-general, Dyke told MPs that the BBC needed to adapt to a digital multi-channel TV environment. He said BBC1 would largely become an entertainment channel, while assuring the committee that there would always be a place for current affairs. BBC2 would carry more serious output, while BBC Choice would become youth and comedy channel BBC3. BBC Knowledge would evolve into BBC4 - an arts and culture channel. </p> <p><strong>July 12: </strong>Dyke failed in his bid to lure friend and former LWT colleague lord Melvyn Bragg to the BBC. Lord Bragg signed a lucrative four-year contract to remain LWT controller of arts and features.</p> <p><strong>July 10:</strong> It was announced that up to 1,100 BBC jobs were to go as part of Dyke's restructuring of the organisation. Most of the job losses and 70% of accompanying savings were to come from support areas - including human resources, marketing and publicity, strategy and finance - and management, with around 200 posts expected to be axed from the resources division. </p> <p>The cuts form part of measures expected to produce savings of \u00a3750m over the next six years, as the BBC strives to meet Dyke's target of increasing the proportion of licence fee revenue it spends on programming and services from 76% to 85%. </p> <p>Dyke also unveiled further details of the new BBC corporate structure he would be introducing, including four new TV genre commissioners for entertainment, drama, factual and arts programming, who would work with the channel controllers. </p> <p>Within the factual and learning production division, 10 department heads were asked to compete for three new posts: head of documentaries and investigations, leisure and factual programming and specialist factual. A new head of religion and ethics post was also created within the division. </p> <p>Factual and learning was asked to work with BBC News to create a business programming department.</p> <p>The former drama and entertainment department management teams were to be merged and streamlined within the new drama, entertainment and children's production division, under Alan Yentob, who would also oversee a new innovative unit, Fictionlab.</p> <p>BBC Radio, headed by Jenny Abramsky, was renamed Radio &amp; Music. </p> <p><strong>June 21:</strong> Dyke announced a further \u00a315m in funding for BBC1 and BBC2 - to come from efficiency savings - as the BBC unveiled its 1999-2000 annual report. In the face of criticism from the BBC governors that the average quality of BBC1 shows \"was still not good enough\", Dyke promised a \"fundamental change\" in the channel's performance. But he skirted around a question about whether BBC1 controller Peter Salmon was to blame for the channel's poor showing. </p> <p>The annual report also revealed that Dyke's predecessor, Sir John Birt, received a termination payment of \u00a3328,400 for retiring early.</p> <p><strong>June 15:</strong> The BBC won back live rights to the FA Cup final from ITV. The corporation also secured live rights to England's home football internationals, as part of a \u00a3400m three-year deal with BSkyB. </p> <p>However, Dyke was forced to back-track on accusations of skulduggery by ITV and the Premiership in the earlier deal to wrest Match of the Day football highlights away from the BBC. Match of the Day will be revived for a handful of weekends each year to cover the FA Cup.</p> <p><strong>June 14:</strong> Dyke, who arrived at the BBC promising to reverse the loss of key sports rights, suffered the biggest reversal of his tenure to date when ITV snatched Premiership highlights, effectively signalling the death-knell for Saturday night BBC1 institution Match of the Day. The BBC lost out despite doubling what it paid for the previous highlights deal - to \u00a3120m over three years. Dyke misjudged how much ITV wanted the rights; the commercial broadcaster bid \u00a3183m.</p> <p><strong>June 12:</strong> In the first public indication of a major shift in the BBC's strategic thinking, director of television Mark Thompson announced plans to move from the mixed schedules offered by BBC1 and BBC2 to genre-based channels. In a speech at the Banff TV festival in Canada, which was drafted in close consultation with Dyke, he said there would be \"no sacred cows\" in a review of how the BBC should adapt its TV output for the digital multi-channel era. Thompson added that genre-based channels would allow the BBC to extend, rather than dilute, its public service remit. </p> <p>But the speech aroused immediate fears that the BBC was planning to dumb down its TV output and turn BBC1 into an entertainment service, shifting news and serious documentaries and current affairs to BBC2. </p> <p>On the same day, it was announced that BBC director of public policy Patricia Hodgson was leaving the corporation to become Independent Television Commission chief executive. Hodgson was regarded as one of Sir John Birt's most trusted lieutenants, and her role had already been diminished under Dyke.</p> <p><strong>June 5:</strong> ITV controller of children's and youth Nigel Pickard, who worked for Dyke at TVS in the 80s, was poached to become BBC controller of children's programmes.</p> <p><strong>May 20:</strong> Grandstand, the BBC's flagship Saturday afternoon sports programme, was cancelled because of a lack of decent events to show. The 42-year-old institution, which had previously only come off air during annual holiday periods and the funeral of Diana, princess of Wales, was the victim of the BBC's loss of sports rights.</p> <p><strong>May 13:</strong> Dyke risked sparking a political row with the appointment of former Independent editor Andrew Marr as the BBC's political editor. Marr, who is regarded as left-leaning, was recruited by Dyke and head of news Tony Hall to replace Robin Oakley. Oakley, a former Times political editor with Conservative sympathies, was persuaded to retire a year early to make way for Marr.</p> <p><strong>May 10:</strong> In a further cost-cutting measure, BBC department heads received a memo from Dyke informing them that in future croissants would not be served at breakfast meetings.</p> <p><strong>May 2: </strong>A shuttle bus service was introduced to ferry staff between Broadcasting House in central London and Television Centre 'out west'. The move formed part of a Dyke-inspired clampdown on taxi costs. </p> <p><strong>April 7: </strong>Dyke pledged to increase the proportion of BBC employees from ethnic minorities to 10%, and double the number of managers from ethnic backgrounds by 2003, in a speech at the race in the media awards dinner. He said people from ethnic minorities made up 8% of the BBC workforce, but only 2% of managers. </p> <p><strong>April 3:</strong> Unveiling his strategic vision for \"One BBC\", Dyke promised to spend at least an extra \u00a3100m on programming and services in the coming year. </p> <p>He announced plans for a flatter management structure, with an 18-strong executive committee at its centre. </p> <p>Dyke also set a target of reducing the proportion of licence fee income spent on running the BBC from 24% to 15% over the next five years - in order to invest more in programming.</p> <p>He said this would free up \u00a3200m a year to spend on programmes and help meet the government's savings target of \u00a31.2bn over the next seven years. Dyke indicated that drama and entertainment would be top of the list for extra funding, but said neglected areas, such as local radio, would also benefit.</p> <p>Dyke said he wanted to bring programme-makers closer to the centre of decision-making - 10 out of the 18 executive committee members would be responsible for production or broadcasting, compared with four in the previous senior executive forum.</p> <p>As part of the management reorganisation, the much-maligned, Birt-inspired division between the BBC's broadcasting and production operations was abolished, along with the independent commissioning group. Four programming divisions were created: drama, entertainment &amp; children, factual and learning, sport &amp; news - along with a new media division to develop interactive TV and online operations. </p> <p>In sport, children's and education, commissioning and programme-making were reintegrated. All in-house producers were to be offered output guarantees and longer term commissions. And the BBC internal market was to be simplified, with the number of business units cut from 190 to 50.</p> <p>In radio, Abramsky was given responsibility for Radio 5 Live and music production - from the News and Production directorates, respectively.</p> <p><strong>March 8: </strong>The BBC saw off Kelvin MacKenzie's TalkSport to retain radio rights to England's home cricket Tests, in a bid orchestrated by Dyke. The BBC was said to have paid about \u00a32m for the five-year deal. </p> <p><strong>March 2: </strong>Helen Boaden was appointed Radio 4 controller, replacing James Boyle.</p> <p><strong>February 21:</strong> Chris Smith announced a BBC funding settlement that gave it a rise in licence fee income equivalent to \u00a3200m a year over the next seven years. As a result, the licence fee for 2000-2001 would rise by 1.5% above inflation from April 1 - to \u00a3104.</p> <p>While offering the BBC more money, Smith neatly side-stepped the \u00a324 digital licence fee proposed by the Davies committee, which had been so roundly condemned by commercial rivals as a \"digital poll tax\". </p> <p>But the increase he offered was well below the extra \u00a33bn the BBC had asked for to see it through to the end of the existing licence fee charter period in April 2007. Describing his proposals as \"tough love\", Smith ordered the BBC to find a further \u00a31.1bn in funding from \"self-help\" measures, including efficiency savings and increased commercial income.</p> <p>Smith also announced plans to reform the BBC's self-governing status. The role of the board of governors was to be reviewed, along with the corporation's finances and fair trading commitments and the public service justification for new digital services such as News 24. He also confirmed a number of new licence fee concessions, including half-price fees for the blind and a free licence for the over-75s.</p> <p><strong>February 6: </strong>Dyke sanctioned the launch of a dedicated BBC online sports website. On the same day, BSkyB snatched the rights to cover the Bafta film awards ceremony from the corporation.</p> <p><strong>February 1: </strong>On his first official day in charge of the BBC, Dyke told an audience of 450 senior staff gathered at Television Centre to stop moaning or leave. He pledged to put programmes first and free up money to spend on them, starting with a \u00a310m reduction in the cost of hiring management consultants. </p> <p>His second main aim was to improve the BBC's internal culture. Dyke praised his predecessor Sir John's achievements, especially the launch of BBC Online.</p> <p><strong>January 31:</strong>Sir John's last day as director-general.</p> <p><strong>January 20: </strong>Dyke bowed to mounting pressure from critics and sold his \u00a36m holding in Granada - pre-empting a meeting with the BBC governors, after which he could have been ordered to sell the stake. In a statement, Dyke said he had decided to sell the shares to prevent his early days as director-general from being dominated by controversy. </p> <p><strong>January 16:</strong> It emerged that the BBC governors had given Dyke until the end of April - two months after taking over as director-general - to sell his Granada shares - valued at about \u00a36m. The disclosure prompted howls of protest about a possible conflict of interest. Dyke acquired the equity stake when Granada took over LWT. </p> <p><strong>January 1:</strong> Sir John became a lord, courtesy of the new year's honours list. On the same day, the BBC announced that he would be stepping down two months earlier than planned, at the end of January, giving credence to the theory that the life peerage formed part of a trade-off to prize his hands off the BBC tiller.</p> <p><strong>November 18 1999:</strong> In his first major public speech after being appointed director-general, Dyke pledged to place education at the heart of his strategy. </p> <p><strong>November 1 1999: </strong>Dyke joined the BBC as director-general designate, working alongside Sir John in a handover period due to last until the end of March 2000. The pair were to share adjoining offices. </p> <p>Dyke announced immediately that he would be overseeing a review of the relationship between the Broadcast directorate and other BBC divisions, including Production and the corporate centre. </p> <p>BBC observers took this as an indication that he intended to dismantle the corporate structure put in place by Sir John. The review was to take in TV commissioning, the four national radio services, new digital TV channels and BBC Online. Dyke would also take over direct control of Broadcast when chief executive Will Wyatt retired at the end of the year.</p> <p><strong>October 1 1999:</strong> Dyke resigned from the board of Manchester United.</p> <p><strong>August 29 1999:</strong> BBC1 controller Peter Salmon told the Guardian Edinburgh International TV Festival that he would be asking Dyke for an extra \u00a3100m in his annual budget to combat falling ratings. Salmon had faced mounting criticism because of falling ratings and the alleged dumbing down of BBC1 output. </p> <p><strong>August 19 1999:</strong> Dyke sold his remaining Pearson shares, netting \u00a3800,000.</p> <p><strong>August 5 1999:</strong> A government-appointed committee chaired by leading economist Gavyn Davies recommended that the BBC's future funding needs be met by introducing a digital licence fee. The Davies committee's report suggested the additional licence fee be levied from people with access to digital TV services. It would initially be set at \u00a324 from April 2000, but then fall as the uptake of digital services grew - to \u00a312 by 2006. </p> <p>The Davies report estimated that this measure, along with efficiency savings, the privatisation of BBC Resources and sale of a 49% stake in BBC Worldwide, would net the corporation an extra \u00a3150-200m a year over this period. </p> <p>The committee recommended that advertising, subscription or sponsorship should not be introduced to the BBC's core services. They also said the BBC's accounts should more transparent and open to greater scrutiny by the Office of Fair Trading and National Audit Office, and that the licence fee discount for blind people should be increased to 50%.</p> <p>The Davies report's digital licence fee recommendation was criticised by Sir John for not providing sufficient money to meet the corporation's funding needs. The BBC submission to the Davies committee had asked for an extra \u00a3650m a year to fund new digital services and ensure its public service remit was not watered down. </p> <p>The digital licence fee proposal met with howls of protest from commercial media players, including the ITV companies and BSkyB, which said it would blight their efforts to sell digital TV services to the public.</p> <p><strong>August 2 1999: </strong>BBC executives were stunned by the defection of iconic sports presenter Des Lynam to ITV. Lynam signed a four-year deal reportedly worth \u00a35m, citing unhappiness with the late scheduling of Match of the Day as one reason for his move.</p> <p><strong>June 24 1999:</strong> In a brief statement, the BBC announced that Dyke would replace Sir John as director-general. The announcement followed an extraordinary few days of behind-the-scenes political manoeuvring and intrigue. The final decision to appoint Dyke had been taken the previous evening by BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland and the board of governors over dinner. </p> <p>Even at this stage, the governors remained split, with only seven of the 12 believed to have joined Bland - a close friend of Dyke's since their days working together as LWT chairman and chief executive, respectively - in approving his appointment. They had failed to reach agreement the previous week, amid newspaper reports that governors opposed to Dyke's candidacy, including vice-chairwoman Baroness Young, had threatened to resign over the issue - rumours officially denied by the BBC.</p> <p>The reason for the split was the controversy over Dyke's links to Labour and whether he would be impartial. Back in April, the Times had sparked a row over Dyke's political allegiences by revealing he had donated \u00a350,000 to Labour since 1994. </p> <p>Rival candidates - who included BBC News chief executive Tony Hall, ITV chief executive Richard Eyre and BBC director of television Alan Yentob - had also begun briefing against Dyke in the spring and early summer, as the odds on him landing the job shortened and the race to become BBC director-general came increasingly dirty.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Tuesday August 1</strong><br>Pastor <strong>Ray McCauley</strong>, the man to whom Hansie Cronje turned when the allegations against him become known, urges him not to cash in on his downfall. \"My advice to him would be to stop, stop right now ...

In the third allegation, a person could not be testified. In the fourth, I have been found guilty not of match-fixing but attempting to fix the first Test match at Karachi in September 1994 against Australia ... The Inquiry Commission was convinced that a match can only be fixed by five or four players working together. It cannot be fixed by an individual or by two players ...

Malik has claimed that both Pakistan and Australia had been bribed to lose a one-day match between the sides in Colombo in 1994. \"Mr Melick has conducted a comprehensive and thorough investigation into the Salim Malik claims and established that there is no evidence to support such suggestions,\" says ACB chief executive Malcolm Speed.</p> <p><strong>Friday August 11</strong><br>The King Commission's interim report is published. It makes no recommendations for disciplinary action, although it does allow the UCB to convene a disciplinary hearing on <strong> Herschelle Gibbs</strong>, <strong> Pieter Strydom </strong> and <strong> Henry Williams</strong>.

Meanwhile, <strong>R N Sawani</strong>, joint director of the CBI declares that he is \"satisfied\" with the progress being made in their match-fixing investigations. A preliminary report is being finalised and will be submitted to the Sports Ministry in September. </p> <p>In a three part TV interview on South African subscription channel M-Net, Cronje says that <strong>Herschelle Gibbs</strong> should not receive further punishment for his part in the match-fixing scandal. \"In my opinion Herschelle should be given another chance to play. On the day he played superbly. Surely if you were told to get less than 20 and then you get 73 off 53 balls, then obviously you did not pay attention to what was said. You entertained the thought, you were tempted but you never followed through.\"</p> <p>South African sports minister <strong>Ngconde Balfour</strong> confirms that there are no major surprises in the King Commission interim report, which is published on cricket.co.za. \"There is not much in it really, no recommendations, nothing much. I am still of the opinion that there are only one or two people involved in this type of thing and we can easily clean up the game.\" The report makes no recommendations of disciplinary action, nor does it indicate whether Cronje will be granted immunity from criminal prosecution. </p> <p>The Daily Telegraph reports that <strong>Judge King</strong> has asked the South African president Thabo Mbeki to widen his terms of reference. This would allow King to investigate match-fixing dating back to 1995. A commission source is quoted as saying, \"We don't know what happened between the 1995 offer (to throw an ODI against Pakistan) and early this year. Were there other attempts to bribe South African cricketers? The present terms of reference do not allow us to investigate.\"</p> <p><strong>Friday August 25</strong><br> In his interim report, <strong>Judge King</strong> takes a dim view of Hansie Cronje*s activities. \"There is a common thread to these events which is shared by others where Cronje sought to involve his team-mates in match-fixing or related matters and that is that the initial approach is made jocularly. It seems that this was Cronje*s modus operandi. He would sound out his colleagues, in a way which would enable him to say later, if the need arose, that he had only been joking.\" </p> <p>In the second part of his interview, <strong>Cronje</strong> praises the effective work of the match-fixing enquiry in South Africa: \"I think we have got to give credit to the way it is being handled here as opposed to in Australia. But I would rather have (Mark Waugh and Shane Warne*s) punishment.\" On rediff.com, CBI joint director R N Savani says that Kapil Dev will be summoned before the CBI shortly. \"No date has been fixed for the meeting, but it will take place.\"</p> <p>The BCCI submits a copy of its code of conduct to the Indian government. Former CBI joint director K Madavan is confirmed as Commissioner of Inquiry.</p> <p><strong>Saturday August 26</strong><br> Cronje absolves <strong>Nicky Boje</strong> of any involvement in match-fixing. Boje had been mentioned in alleged telephone calls between Cronje and an Indian bookmaker.</p> <p><strong>Sunday August 27</strong><br> Income-tax officials in India raid the residence of off-spinner <strong>Nikhil Chopra</strong> in connection with their match-fixing investigations.</p> <p><strong>Monday August 28<br>Herschelle Gibbs</strong> and <strong>Henry Williams</strong> are banned from international cricket until January 1, 2001, while <strong>Pieter Strydom</strong> is acquitted of a charge of attempting to place a bet during the 5th Test between South Africa and England. Both Gibbs and Williams pleaded guilty to accepting money to underperform in a one-day international. In addition to the bans, Gibbs is fined 60,000 rand and Williams 10,000 rand. The bans do not preclude the pair from playing domestic cricket.</p> <p>In a prepared statement, Gibbs does not dispute his punishment. \"I am obviously bitterly disappointed that I will not be able to represent my country until next year. However, I am grateful that I will at least have the honour of being able to play for Western Province if so selected.\"</p> <p>Former BCCI president <strong>IS Bindra</strong> criticises the board's treatment of Kapil Dev. \"It is wrong on the part of the BCCI to gun for the team coach Kapil Dev though the board had earlier promised all help to him.\"</p> <p><strong>Tuesday August 29</strong><br>Speculation mounts that Cronje could face civil claims running into millions of rands from past and present team-mates who suffered financial losses in the match- fixing scandal. He may also have to pay legal costs incurred during the King Commission. On cricketline.com, a <strong>senior South African player</strong>, who asks not to be named, says that he would sue Cronje were he Herschelle Gibbs or Henry Williams. The player also says that Cronje approached players from the traditionally less privileged sectors of South African society \"to do his dirty work for him.\"</p> <p>In the Cape Times <strong>Herman Gibbs</strong>, father of Herschelle, is quoted as deeming the sentences \"bullshit - the boys have suffered enough. What I would like to know is who are the UCB accountable to in terms of their own misdemeanours when it comes to administering the game?\" </p> <p>Gibbs senior also tells rediff.com that he would like to <strong>sue</strong> Hansie Cronje for corrupting his son, and the UCB for failing to protect him from match-fixing. He says his son should act \"like a boxer stepping back into the ring after a bad blow\", and show that he is the best opener in South Africa.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday August 30</strong><br> In his cricketline.com column, <strong>Allan Donald</strong> expresses his relief that <strong>Gibbs</strong> and <strong>Henry Williams</strong> did not receive a longer sentence: \"Some people would say [Gibbs and Williams] deserved life bans. Neither of them actually went through with playing poorly on purpose but the fact that they even agreed to is very serious. They know now, though, that they've done wrong, and were both probably expecting suspended life bans. I'm glad the UCB wasn't too severe on them.\" </p> <p>New Zealand Cricket chief executive <strong>Chris Doig</strong> expresses his disappointment at the penalties meted out to Gibbs and Williams: \"I am surprised and disappointed at the leniency. For the sake of cricket we had to be seen to be taking a strong stance on match-fixing. On the basis the players appear to be guilty of being involved in some way of tacitly approving match-fixing, I think the penalties are modest.\"</p> <p>BCCI president <strong>AC Muthiah</strong> criticises <strong>IS Bindra</strong>, who had expressed his dissatisfaction with the board's treatment of <strong>Kapil Dev</strong>. \"Bindra could have made these remarks at the Bangalore meeting. In fact it was Bindra who had vehemently said in his earlier statements that Kapil Dev had offered money to <strong>Manoj Prabhakar</strong> and everyone knows these statements had kicked off so much dust.\"</p> <p><strong>Thursday August 31</strong><br> In an interview with the New Statesman, <strong>Michael Atherton</strong> says that he does not think English cricket has a match-fixing problem: \"I've not had any doubt about an England player. I can't say with hand on heart that I'm absolutely certain it hasn't happened, but I'd bet against it.\" The magazine also says that Atherton has played in a one-day international that he believes was fixed but, without evidence to support him, he has refused to name the game.</p> <p> <em>Watch this space</em></p>",
  "<p>The Scottish actor Iain Glen arrives for our interview looking particularly mean. His hair has been dyed black, swept back and extended for a classic evil baddie look, to fit in with his role as Lara Croft's malevolent nemesis in the feature-film adaptation of the computer game Tomb Raider, in which he stars opposite Angelina Jolie. Then he goes and ruins the fa\u00e7ade by being nice. </p> <p>Glen is at that position in an actor's career where he is the first choice for a certain recognisable television role - the boyish, slightly off-kilter, but down-to-earth bloke who understands women, typified by his sports journalist in Glasgow Kiss - but not to the extent that he has been typecast, meaning that he can play a cad too. The ITV two-parter Anchor Me seems perfectly suited to his particular abilities. He plays Nathan, a Somerset boy who has educated himself out of his class, returning home to his dying mother with the hope of making his family face up to the death of a younger brother. What starts off as typical Barratt-Homes Sunday-night middle-England drama develops into a web of intrigue spun by fraught emotions, with the classic British trait of keeping up appearances at the root of all the problems. </p> <p>\"I was really drawn to it because it was one of those rare projects where you don't spend half of your time building bridges and subtexting things that aren't there,\" says Glen. \"This felt more like classical writing - you reach as far into it as you possibly can. It's not about you trying to improve it, it's about you trying to meet its potential.\" </p> <p>Glen's character is also trying to deal with a communication breakdown with his son, and a loss of excitement in marriage, on top of coming to terms with the long-buried family tragedy. On returning home he reaches back into the salad days of his childhood as all these crises loom down on him, and unfortunately finds consolation in the arms of his teenage sweetheart, now married to his rather brutish brother. </p> <p>\"Most television dramas are simplified to the point where you only have a simple objective to convey by a simple line, but the stuff of life is often where we're saying we're incredibly happy with something when in fact we're fiercely jealous and so on. So when writing conveys that, it's easier to play because you're immediately in a familiar situation. Underpinning the whole drama is the idea that people don't communicate, that people miscommunicate.\" </p> <p>Another theme is the sibling rivalry between the one who escapes from the nest and the one left to fend for the family in the shadow of the more glamorous other. Surprisingly, Glen claims to be of the latter category. \"As my brother so touchingly put it in his best man speech at my wedding, he didn't recognise I had a personality until I was 18, so it was hard to remember anything flattering to say about me. I always felt in his shadow - I'd like to put it down to the fact that he was four years older than me, but maybe it was just that I wasn't capable at very much. It's difficult to speak about such things without sounding pretentious, but you use this kind of experience for acting - it's broadly what you would call emotional memory.\" </p> <p>Glen was half of the phenomenon that was last year's The Blue Room, in which he played opposite Nicole Kidman as a series of clients to her prostitute at London's tiny Donmar Warehouse theatre. </p> <p>\"It was great,\" he says of working with his leggy Australian co-star. \"Within two minutes of working with her, I forgot who she was and we just got on with it. There was only two of us and we had a lot of work to do. We had to find all these various sexual couplings and not end up being Nic and Iain. Does a prostitute kiss a taxi driver differently to a politician? That sort of thing.\" Glen has remained friends with Kidman and her husband Tom Cruise. \"Our kids are the same age,\" he says, understatedly. \"We put them together and go off for a game of golf.\" </p> <p>Although not on a Cruise and Kidman level of fame, Glen has reached that stage where he is sometimes mistaken for his characters. \"I played a serial killer once, and had men coming up to me who had decided I was fucking hard and dangerous, and they wanted to be hard and dangerous too. When it happens I either get very mincey, or run.\" Recent projects could up the danger ante further. He played a cad in last year's adaptation of Wives And Daughters, and next year his diabolical villain will bring a British flavour to Tomb Raider. \"It has an English setting - and I've got to be careful here because we've all signed secrecy contracts - but the director has given each of the characters a whole world. Lara's looking for mysterious elements for the good of the world, and I'm doing it to destroy. I'm enjoying it immensely. We were shooting at Battersea Power Station at night, and the whole sky was lit up, vast machines were going through the shots, smoke everywhere, multicoloured welding effects falling from the skies, and I'm thinking, what am I doing here, I'm from Scotland! But my character was making it all happen. It's a real treat.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Anchor Me, Sunday, 9pm, ITV</p>",
  "<p>David Elleray has called for the introduction of rugby-style sin-bins in the Premiership, which he says will slash the numbers of yellow and red cards in the English game.</p> <p>Speaking on Jimmy Hill's Last Word show on Sky Sports.com TV, which is broadcast tonight, Elleray used the example of Patrick Vieira's wild reaction to his initial booking during Arsenal's recent clash with Liverpool to support his case.</p> <p>Elleray said: \"He was upset at the challenge and then he ran around and everyone could see that the red mist had come down. Now, if that first yellow card had actually been in the sin-bin, he would have been in the sin-bin hopefully calming down, and would have come back on in a more controlled frame of mind. </p> <p>\"I would like us to try the sin-bin. It works in hockey, works in rugby and I would like to see it in soccer. It would reduce the number of cards and that would be fantastic.\" </p> <p>Elleray also said that officials were under increased pressure this season to apply the letter of the law with regard to over-excited goal celebrations. Vieira and his Arsenal team-mate Silvinho both escaped punishment for taking off their shirts during the Gunners' recent 5-3 win over Charlton. </p> <p>Elleray said: \"If a player completely removes his shirt it should be a yellow card. I think Stephen Lodge on Saturday used the spirit of the law, not the letter of the law. It's an example of a directive which puts great pressure on referees. </p> <p>\"I suspect (Vieira and Silvinho) will be reported to the FA. It's tough, particularly if players are on a yellow card.\"</p>",
  "<p>Internet company Freeserve faces relegation from the stock market's premier league after being stalked throughout the summer by takeover speculation, with rumours of a bid from Germany's T-Online resurfacing yesterday.</p> <p>The company's shares have tumbled from a year-high of 925p to 252.75p, due to growing belief that one of the first European internet IPOs will be left at the altar in the wave of consolidation sweeping the sector. These fears have pushed Freeserve to the edge of expulsion from the FTSE 100 next week, when the list has its quarterly shake-up.</p> <p>A Freeserve spokesperson said: \"It is up to the London Stock Exchange to comment on our role in the FTSE, but it's business as usual here.\"</p> <p>An industry source said the collapse of T-Online's \u00a36bn bid for Freeserve in June was due to clashes between T-Online chief executive Wolfgang Keuntje and Ron Sommer, the chief executive of parent company Deutsche Telekom. Their dispute over international strategy centred on the appropriate price for Freeserve, leading to Keuntje's resignation.</p> <p>\"Sommer wanted a deal at any price\", the source said, \"whereas Keuntje did not want to throw money away. Now that Keuntje has gone, Sommer has effectively taken control. Detlev Bushal, his replacement, is very much a Sommers man and not renowned for his independence from the boss.\"</p> <p>Analysts say that T-online is well-positioned to become a pan-European internet portal, as it has a strong position in France and is dominant in Germany. Sommers is likely to resurrect a deal for Spain's Yacom web portal, with a Freeserve takeover guaranteeing a strong UK presence, though boardroom troubles could yet scupper both deals.</p> <p>High street retailer Dixons owns 80% of Freeserve, but the prospect of low revenues from flat rate internet access fees has prompted speculation about the subsidiary's status. It also led to arguments with T-Online over the company's value, which could continue if another bid is launched.</p> <p>In August, Dixons announced a deal with online gaming company gameplay.com, aiming to sell computer games through Freeserve and retail outlets. The move took observers by surprise, who interpreted it as a sign that Dixons may see the company as an important part of its future.</p>",

  "When August began, the American election looked as though it would be about Clinton's trousers. But the month changed everything. Watching it unfold, I saw most parts of Bill Clinton, his inimitable charisma as well as his porous apparel, receding daily from the public mind. The election will be about the future not the past. It's the most important election in the world. It may also turn out to be the best election in the world, restoring stark left-right argument to the politics of a western democracy for the first time since the 80s. <p>At the start, it seemed possible that the voters were getting ready to withdraw from Al Gore, the Democratic candidate for president, the forgiveness they'd offered Clinton for the Monica calamity. During that humiliation, the public withheld the loathing which many politicians and commentators, including this one, thought would empty Clinton's remaining two years of all authority. We were wrong. But George W Bush promised Americans he would restore \"dignity and respect\" to the White House. It was the insistent coded mantra he offered the Republican convention. For two weeks, with Gore 12 points behind in the polls, it seemed to be working. </p> <p>This would have been perverse. Was Gore to be trapped between Clinton's incorrigible frailties, on which the people took delayed revenge, and his populistic brilliance, of which the vice president, a leaden speaker and earnest policy-wonk, is in regrettably short supply? The laid-back Bush, reformed alcoholic with distant rumours of cocaine lying unrebutted on the table, had the family connections, the new-leaf repentance, the pleasing manner and the apparent experience stemming from one of the weakest governorships in the US, to take advantage of the personality contest the election might easily become. </p> <p>But already it is different. The personalities will continue to matter, and the body-language is finely watched. Gore hired a ballet dancer to coach him in platform movement. Significant polling gains are attributed to the most lubricious kiss any politician ever gave his wife, uncoached, on a public platform. It's also true that both candidates know their battle is for the centre, both the political and, as it happens, the geographical, the eastern-central and middle-western states. The most startling development as August waned, though, was the clarifying of their differences. </p> <p>The man responsible for this is Al Gore. He needed to change the subject, away from Clinton's aura and Bush's contentless agenda, and did so by the un-American activity of turning sharply to the left. I don't want to exaggerate this. Gore is still locked into funding from corporate America, still mute on inequality, and well outflanked by Ralph Nader running as an independent candidate. But Bush is much more uncomfortable with a turn of events that is forcing him to be specific. \"Dignity and respect\" have almost ceased to matter, as the details of his \"compassionate conservatism\" begin to be ranged against a Gore programme that shows more confidence than Clinton's ever did in the traditional Democrat constituency. </p> <p> Central to Bush's programme is a massive tax cut of $1.3 trillion, geared without discrimination in favour of the rich. Gore promises less than half that, mainly with subsidies to middle-class (working-class is outside the US political vocabulary) families. A projected budget surplus of $4.6 trillion over 10 years would be used by Gore mainly to cut the debt, by Bush mainly to cut taxes and start privatising social security. But Gore would spend $400bn on health care - insurance for the low-paid, and free drugs for the elderly - Bush a quarter of that. Gore favours a huge federal spend on education: $115bn over the decade, a 50% rise in an area traditionally left to states and localities. Bush, while making education his social priority, wants to rearrange school structures rather than spend anything like that kind of money. </p> <p>Whoever wins, Congress will have the final say in all this. But other differences speak as clearly for a philosophical divide. Bush and Gore would engage with the public and the Senate from starting points quite distant from each other. The most blatant contrast is over environmental protection, where Gore's commitment is as lengthy and knowledgeable as Bush's is Texas-brutish towards any measure making life harder for business, and damn the consequences for global warming. Myriad crucial choices display the same cleavage of attitude. Three seem especially noteworthy. Over gun control, national missile defence and abortion rights, the American voter has to choose between leaders who are absolutists on none of them, but whose preferred biases are heavily divergent. </p> <p>Gore's predicament, in other words, has turned this into an issue-based campaign. He had to do it this way. It conformed to his own wonkish nature, and played to his strengths as a serious politician who has built national experience over 30 years. More pressingly, it was the only escape-route from the trivialities that suited Bush better. It has forced Bush into the open, requiring the sort of performance in which he has so far failed to shine. </p> <p>How, exactly, the issues turn out to be argued is another matter. There's more money available for this year's campaign than for any in recorded history, and most of it will be spent on 30-second TV and radio commercials. That's the idiom that will blanket the airwaves with increasing frenzy for the next two months. America is not a predominantly political country. There is no conversation that could be called national. Many people will have little background against which to measure the roaring assaults. Reduced to three sentences, the case for a trillion dollar tax cut may be all too easily misunderstood. We're not talking Socratic dialogue here. Personal viciousness will also be heating up. It's perfectly suited to the insidious soundbite. The pretence that the other guy is sincere, a ritual bow this August to focus-group disgust at \"divisiveness\", will soon explode. </p> <p>But those are commonplace developments: louder and richer than ever, but the usual currency of American politics. What is not usual is a disagreement that can be called ideological. That has not been so common, to put it mildly, in American as in European postwar politics. In this contest it is more explicit than in the last German, French or British elections - though William Hague is doing his best to ensure that next year's choice will be clear enough. What Gore, with the aid of Bush, is doing is to challenge some of the assumptions which persuaded Clinton that the only way he could win and govern was by leading his party from the right. This is making for an epic contest, to be decided as usual by money and organisation, but introducing the US in a new role that puts Europe to shame: leader of a political argument that really matters. </p> <p> hugo.young@compuserve.com</p>",
  "A strange thing is happening in clubland. Perhaps it is just that club design and music have been plundering their pasts for so long, that all possible variables have been exhausted. But the people who run them seem to have decided that they have only one chance left for inventiveness and individuality in terms of design: the toilet. Or, more specifically, the women's toilet. <p>Go to any swanky club these days and you are likely to find that what was once a rather odious, former broom cupboard equipped with cold running water and a greying sliver of soap (if you were lucky) has been expanded to lounge proportions, decorated with the opulence of a high-class bordello, and filled with more toiletries than you could decently cram into your handbag. These days, you're nobody in clubland if you haven't managed to instal a headline-grabbing loo. </p> <p>We've had the great female urinal debate, in which club promoters seemed shocked to discover that women were reluctant to flash their pants in front of an assembled company of random strangers. Then there was the infamous one-way mirror in the ladies' loo at the Elbow Room in Islington, north London, where the men assumed that the reflective surface in front of them was merely a way to check their hair/flies/teeth, until they were alerted by the shrieks and bangings from the other side of the glass. Now, the Infinity club in Manchester has installed double cubicles or \"twobicles\" for female customers. So popular are they that the queues are enormous, even when other, single cubicles are free. \"Ladies always seem to go to the toilet in pairs,\" says Rob Broadbent, marketing manager of the club. \"What they do in there has always been something of a mystery among us men.\" </p> <p>Ah, that old chestnut - the universal complaint of blokes who are just trying to fathom the strange and flighty creatures with whom they share their lives. I don't know who it was that first picked up on it, but I remember Jasper Carrott doing a whole routine about it in the mid-80s, along the lines of a baffled why-do-they-do-it? Did nobody think of telling him: \"Jasper, we're just trying to get away from you for a bit?\" And remember the scene in the film Trainspotting? Two women are - wait for it - in a club toilet. One is telling the other that she has read an article in a women's magazine about how delaying sex for five weeks is good for a relationship; meanwhile, outside, the man in question is moaning to his mate that he can't wait any longer. When the women return, the men demand, with more than a trace of paranoia: \"What have you been talking about?\" The women look at each other and say, in flawless unison: \"Shopping.\" </p> <p>This incident reveals men's deep-seated fear of the female toilet confab: it both fascinates and repels them. They are afraid of being discussed, but just as afraid of not being discussed. </p> <p>Let's get this straight, once and for all: the female toilet is beauty parlour, counselling room, haven, bathroom, chill-out zone and lounge all rolled into one. The conversation is as likely to be about men as it is about music. Or clothes. Or who is in that night, or what is on TV, or office gossip, life laments, existential reflections - whatever. </p> <p>It's not that we are going behind closed doors to bitch and scheme about the opposite sex; shooting the breeze in the privacy of a closed cubicle is just part of a night out. Women, despite their reluctance to use urinals, have fewer issues with the intimacy of bodily functions than men do: men don't even exchange eye contact in lavatories, let alone lipstick, loo paper, scandal and confidences. </p> <p>It must also be considered that going in with your friend means a certain social protection when you come out: you don't want to reappear on your own to find that your friends aren't where you left them, you're now alone - and seemingly easy prey to the bar sharks that lurk in any club. </p> <p>No matter how female-friendly clubs have become in recent years, you would be hard-pressed to find a woman who feels completely at ease in one on her own.

  "Eliyahu Ben Elissar, who has died aged 68, was Israel's first-ever ambassador to an Arab country. He gained his Cairo posting as a reward for heading Israel's negotiating team at the original Camp David talks of 1978, and his mere presence in Egypt's capital broke many a taboo between Arabs and the Jewish state. He then represented the Likud party for 15 years in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, before accepting the plum diplomatic assignment of Washington in 1996. In 1998, he became ambassador to France. Domestic Israeli politics had seen him ordered home, but he died within a week, in Paris. <p>Initially, little suggested that Elissar would make an ideal peace-broker. He was a lifelong advocate of extreme rightwing views, derived partly from his own experience as a Holocaust orphan. He condemned the Oslo accords of 1993 as \"the murder of our state\", but dutifully defended Israel's policies overseas. </p> <p>As a teenager, he associated with Lehi - or the \"Stern gang\" - the most violent Jewish underground group in the Palestine of the British Mandate. The new state of Israel was very much a Labour Zionist creation, Lehi was forcibly disbanded, and in 1950 Elissar left the country. Still, the cunning and passion of zealots was not to be squandered. Mossad tracked him down to Paris, where he was studying political science and law at the Sorbonne, and recruited him as their European controller for agents operating in Arab lands. </p> <p>Elissar emerged from the shadows in 1965 to serve as representative for the rightwing Herut/Likud party within the World Zionist Organisation. There he met the dynamic and personable Nitza, whom he married in 1979. By the 70s he had become a confidant of Menachem Begin, Israel's fiery opposition leader. After Likud ousted Labour in 1977, it was Ben Elissar who ran the new prime minister's office. Begin recognised in him a kindred spirit: Polish-born, suspicious and intelligent, scarred by memories of anti-Semitism and genocide; a naturally cautious man, yet willing to act boldly if required. </p> <p>In November 1977, Egypt's President Sadat surprised the world by announcing his intention to visit Jerusalem. Elissar arranged the welcome for him, and suddenly faced a new crisis: finding sheet music for the Egyptian national anthem. A year later in Maryland, he agreed to return the entire Sinai Peninsula to the Arab republic in exchange for lasting peace. </p> <p>Rightwingers were shocked that a Greater Israel devotee could \"abandon\" Jewish settlers in their desert outposts. But Elissar knew better. By jettisoning territory, Israel secured its southern flank from future attack; drove a spoke in the wheel of pan-Arab unity; and deferred more painful sacrifices demanded by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. </p> <p>Life in Cairo tested the ambassador - it was hard to build any rapport after decades of enmity - yet he came to know Egypt's leader well, and wrote admiringly of him in a book, Sadat and his Legacy (1998). </p> <p>Such future diplomatic triumph could scarcely have occurred to the boy born in Radom, central Poland, in 1932. He was just 10 when he arrived in Palestine after being smuggled out of a Nazi-controlled ghetto. His parents and siblings all perished in Europe. Elissar's recollections of the period informed his whole life: \"When an enemy says he is going to kill you, believe him,\" he warned. </p> <p>At the same time, Elissar had all the attributes for diplomatic life. He was charming, discreet, had a history doctorate from Geneva University and spoke several languages. His sartorial elegance, intellectual demeanour and neat square beard made him seem like a reincarnation of Theodor Herzl, the 19th-century founder of political Zionism. </p> <p>After Cairo, Elissar served as a Likud member of the Knesset from 1981 until 1996, and twice chaired the legislature's influential foreign policy and defence committee. When his party returned to power, he accepted the ambassadorship to Washington and moved there in September 1996. </p> <p>At first Elissar was hopeful: \"The USA and Israel don't have to agree on everything, but we will always remain family,\" he said. Unfortunately, he became a pawn in a power struggle between his sponsor, foreign minister David Levy, and his prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. \"Bibi\" undermined him repeatedly, excluding him from meetings with the president and contradicting him. </p> <p>To make matters worse, Elissar assumed his post just as the Jerusalem tunnel crisis was erupting. US-Israeli relations hit a nadir over construction at Har Homa, when the Palestinians were not consulted about the passage excavated at the base of the Temple Mount, and violent protest resulted. The ambassador also tried to assuage American non-Orthodox Jews who felt threatened by Israel's conversion laws. He denied press rumours that he had authorised spying, and retorted that the FBI was tapping embassy phones. </p> <p>Yet, overall, Elissar handled his brief with dignity, and forged valuable links with Jordanian and Pakistani diplomats, Arab-Americans and US Senators. He was relieved to be posted to Paris in 1998, where he had worked as an embassy security guard nearly 50 years earlier. Within two years, however, he fell victim to more domestic political intrigue: David Levy resigned as foreign minister, and prime minister Barak ordered his appointee, Ben Elissar, to pack his bags. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, son and daughter. </p> <p>\u0095 Eliyahu Ben Elissar, politician and diplomat, born August 2 1932; died August 12 2000</p>",
  "A 21-year-old football hooligan deported from Euro 2000 yesterday became the first person to receive an international ban under controversial new powers. <p>Christopher Sawford was served with a court summons when the Football (Disorder) Act came into force on Monday and yesterday was banned by magistrates from domestic and international games. </p> <p>Sawford, a Swindon warehouse worker, must surrender his passport and report to police at the time of the kick-off of England games, starting with the friendly against France in Paris on Saturday. </p> <p>Civil liberty campaigners have criticised the law as draconian because those suspected of hooliganism can be banned even if they do not have convictions. Potential suspects are identified by football information officers who help build up evidence, which can include CCTV footage and eyewitness reports. </p> <p>But the Home Office said it was pleased that the police and courts were using the new powers, introduced after the government was embarrassed by the scenes of violence involving England fans during Euro 2000 - and encouraged them to continue to do so in advance of Saturday's game. </p> <p>Special courts will be sitting close to ports and main railway stations so that banning orders can be imposed in the run-up to the game, though police have been playing down the chances of trouble. </p> <p>Sawford was one of dozens of England fans arrested by Belgium police at Euro 2000 on June 16 and deported. Magistrates were yesterday told of his history of violence while following England and Swindon Town. He has two convictions, dating back to 1996 and 1998, for threatening behaviour at a football match. </p> <p>Yesterday Sawford was banned from every domestic game in England and Wales and every England match, home or away, for two years. </p> <p>He will have to surrender his passport at least five days before England play abroad and failure to do so will mean up to six months' imprisonment and a fine of up to \u00a35,000. </p> <p>Sawford was not at his family's smart semi-detached house in the suburb of Fresh brook, Swindon, last night. </p> <p>His mother, Ann, insisted: \"He's just been tarred with the same brush as the rest of them, even though he has done nothing wrong. He's always been a good boy and has never given us any problems.\" </p> <p>There are several other laws already in place - such as the Football Offences and Disorder Act - which can ban fans from games as long as they have convictions for football violence. Under those laws there are currently 115 international and 474 domestic bans in place. </p> <p>The campaign group Liberty has described the legislation as \"ill thought out and hastily constructed\" and suggested that it would be open to challenge under human rights legislation.</p>",
  "Scotland's discredited examination authority yesterday admitted yet another mistake in a series of embarrassing blunders that have left thousands of pupils with the wrong results. <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority, which announced yesterday that two senior officials had left their posts, said that some schools had been sent the wrong information about errors made in their standard grade results. </p> <p>It came a day after the SQA revealed that more than 4,000 pupils would have to have their standard grade results - the equivalent of the GCSE - re-checked because they were inaccurate or incomplete; the same setback that has already affected more than 5,000 pupils who sat the new Higher exams. </p> <p>The Scottish education minister, Sam Galbraith, attacked the SQA for the latest mistake, but is himself under renewed pressure to quit over the fiasco. </p> <p>\"I just think the whole education system in Scotland is in a state of utter chaos,\" said Nicola Sturgeon, education spokeswoman for the Scottish National party. \"The minister cannot stay in his post. He has absolutely no credibility. He is presiding over a chaotic situation yet he does not seem to be in control of his department.\" </p> <p>In the latest mix-up, teachers were sent other schools' details about the pupils affected by the standard grade chaos rather than their own. The SQA blamed \"sequential faxing problems\" but declined to say how many schools had been involved. They said only 1% of standard grade students had received erroneous results and announced that the SQA's head of operations, Jack Greig, had been suspended pending a disciplinary investigation, and the director of awards, David Elliot, stepped down by mutual agreement. </p> <p>The problems with the results for standard grade came to light when the SQA re-assessed the results of all 147,000 examination candidates in Scotland this summer after serious problems with the Higher grades. The SQA say \"data handling errors\" are to blame for omissions and inaccuracies in the results. </p> <p>But Mr Galbraith faces pressure to shoulder responsibility for the crisis. It has emerged that the Scottish executive has blocked plans for a full debate on the issue when the Scottish parliament resumes. Instead, Mr Galbraith will give a 15 minute statement and 30 for questions. </p> <p>A Scottish executive spokesman said the proper time for a debate was after the various inquiries into the affair had been completed. However, critics say the executive is ducking its responsibilities. </p> <p>Lindsay Paterson, professor of education at Edinburgh University, said that was a \"betrayal of accountability\". </p> <p>\"This latest fiasco raises the question of how we are going to motivate 16-year-olds to stay at school and do their Highers ... You can't tell them the system won't fail them, because it already has.\"</p>",
  "A security scare overshadowed President Clinton's arrival in the Colombian port of Cartagena yesterday when police discovered sticks of dynamite in a flat near a building the president was due to visit. <p>Two men, suspected of being members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), the country's largest guerrilla force, were arrested and anti-American leaflets seized. Colombian police said the explosives, weighing about 4.4lb, had not been made up into a bomb. </p> <p>In a separate incident, security staff sealed off an area of the city after finding a suspicious device, which later turned out to be a bag of rubbish. </p> <p>The visit was intended as a show of support for Colombian president Andres Pastrana's efforts to defeat the drugs trade and bring peace to the country after nearly 40 years of civil war violence. </p> <p>A wave of guerrilla attacks and street protests were launched to coincide with the visit. Leftist rebels detonated a car bomb and launched attacks on police stations, army posts and banks, but most of the violence was hundreds of miles away from Cartagena, where the two presidents met to discuss anti-narcotics policy. </p> <p>Around 200 Farc guerrillas launched a daylight raid on the town of Miranda in the southern state of Cauca. In a separate attack, five civilians were killed when Farc rebels rained homemade bombs on the town of Lavateca near the border with Venezuela. </p> <p>The centre of Bogota was paralysed as around 2,000 students, union members and indigenous activists marched on the US embassy. Masked students skirmished with riot police and set a bus on fire. </p> <p>The city was seen as too dangerous a location for talks with Colombian officials, and Mr Clinton was guarded by 5,000 Colombian troops, 350 US agents, helicopter gunships and a naval patrol boat during his visit. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cicad.oas.org/\" target=\"_new\">Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/colombia_197_bgn.html\" target=\"_new\">US state department: Colombia</a><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.presidencia.gov.co/\" target=\"_new\">Government of Colombia</a></p>",
  "<p>After tobacco it could be the motor industry that feels the lash of consumer activist court action, judging by a wave of safety scares to have hit Ford and other vehicle and component manufacturers. </p> <p>A Californian court has ruled in favour of complaints that Ford knowingly installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly 2m vehicles between 1983 and 1995. In a preliminary decision an Alameda county judge said he would issue an order \"compelling recall and repair\" of the cars which some estimate could cost Ford up to $250m. </p> <p>The company says it will appeal, a spokeswoman adding: \"In 18 years there has never been any evidence proving any accident or injury.\" </p> <p>Ford chief executive Jacques Nasser has also come under fire from a US congressman for failing to appear before a House committee investigating the recall of 6.5m Firestone tyres. Shares in Japan's Bridgestone, maker of Firestone tyres in the US, hit a five-year low yesterday , affected by the investigation, calls for a wider recall of tyres and possible criminal charges in Venezuela. </p> <p>Mitsubishi, Japan's fourth largest car maker in which DaimlerChrysler is buying a stake, has been downgraded by credit agencies as fears spread of the financial fallout from a customer complaints scandal which has led to more than a million cars being recalled, including some in Britain. </p> <p><strong> Potential problems</strong><br> </p> <p> The furore led to police raids on Mitsubishi offices at the weekend, warnings about possible court action by the transport ministry and speculation that company president Katsuhiko Kawasoe could be forced to resign. The company has admitted to covering up customer complaints for more than 30 years to avoid the cost of recall. </p> <p>Volkswagen of Germany said last night it was recalling 43,889 of its popular Golf model for repairs to brakes. </p> <p>The level of recalls and safety scares has been growing. Last summer Ford had to recall 5,800 all-terrain Explorer vehicles because of potential problems with cruise control cables. </p> <p>In spring 1999 BMW recalled 200,000 cars because of faulty radiator caps which could have filled car interiors with steam, and asked for checks on 280,000 of its 3-series cars because of an airbag fault. </p> <p>Toyota recalled nearly 800,000 cars last year because of a faulty connection in the suspension which could make them almost undriveable. </p> <p>But product recalls are not restricted to motor manufacturers. On Tuesday Intel, whose processors are used in 80% of personal computers worldwide, was forced to recall of its latest chip after finding it did not perform as it should. Last year the company recalled its 820 chipset due to a design fault. </p> <p>None of the setbacks has proved fatal for the company involved and thecosts are relatively minor. But the impact on a brand's reputation is another matter, and that price increases exponentially if there are suggestions the company knew of a problem but tried to hush it up. </p> <p>Clarence Ditlowof the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer activist group in Washington, notes that the court case in California comes at a bad time because Ford has been boasting in television commercials: \"Trust us, we put safety first.\" According to Mr Ditlow, the court decision says of Ford: \"We put profits first.\" </p> <p>Why are these cases growing in volume? The increasing technological complexity of cars might be one factor but many industry experts are convinced that the car companies are just following a route already travelled by asbestos and tobacco groups. </p> <p>Tougher government regulation and - more importantly - consumer activism put the chemical and cigarette producers into the US courts with class actions and product liability claims. </p> <p>\"No win no pay\" offers from lawyers have encouraged millions of consumers to pursue companies through the courts. There are signs that lawyers are begining to target the motor manufacturers. </p> <p><strong> Deluge of actions</strong><br> </p> <p> Mr Ditlow is convinced that if Ford does eventually lose the California court case it will open the floodgates to a deluge of other actions. </p> <p>\"Like the tobacco companies before them, car companies have had their heads in the sand. They are about to get a rude awakening.\"</p>",
  "A boy who accused a headteacher of slapping him on the face after he was refused permission to go swimming later told police there had been a plan to get her out of the school, according to a recorded police interview shown to Cardiff crown court yesterday. <p>Marjorie Evans is appealing against her conviction by Abergavenny magistrates for common assault, which brought her a sentence of three months' imprisonment suspended for one year. Her appeal is being funded by the National Union of Teachers, whose general secretary, Doug McAvoy, was in court yesterday for the start of the appeal hearing. </p> <p>In the interview three days after the incident in September 1999, the boy, who was then 10, told police he had told his friends not to tell anyone because it would \"ruin the plan\". He said: \"There was a plan. If I didn't tell anyone she would be out of the school. If I told anyone the plan wouldn't work. The plan was to get her out of the school.\" </p> <p>During cross-examination by Greg Taylor, defending, via a video link yesterday, the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, twice got up from his chair refusing to answer questions. But he insisted that Evans had slapped him. </p> <p>He said: \"There was a red mark on the side of my face. It was a harder slap than I thought it would be.\" </p> <p>Christopher Rees, prosecuting, earlier told the hearing that the boy, who has learning difficulties, became sullen after being banned from going swimming with his classmates. </p> <p>It was the crown's case that Evans was faced with a difficult pupil and momentarily lost her self-control and slapped him across the face. </p> <p>\"The crown says it was a slap that was not administered as lawful correction, that it was not in self-defence, but that it was, plain and simply, an unlawful assault after she had lost her temper.\" </p> <p>Evans, 56, of Usk, south Wales, told police that the boy had pushed, punched and headbutted her, but she denied slapping him. </p> <p>Outside court, Mr McAvoy said he had total confidence that the appeal, before a judge and two magistrates, would result in Evans being cleared. </p> <p>He said the case had damaged the image of the teaching profession and was putting off young people who wanted to teach. \"Unfortunately, these sort of allegations are becoming more and more prevalent.\" </p> <p>The case continues today.</p>",
  "<p>They may not yet be in control yet, but robots have literally taken on a life of their own. According to a scientific study published today, computers can now design, test and build their own, increasingly efficient automatons, quite independently of human beings. </p> <p>The breakthrough, described in the latest edition of Nature magazine, suggests that machines will ultimately be capable of \"artificial evolution\" - mutating, testing and improving their design far faster than living organisms. </p> <p>If a \"race\" of computerised robots is ultimately able to reproduce itself independently - the scenario portrayed in the apocalyptic Terminator movies, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger - historians may look back to this moment as its genesis. </p> <p>Hod Lipson and Jordan Pollack, computer scientists at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, acknowledge concerns about their work but argue \"there are many, many further steps before this technology could become dangerous\". </p> <p>Earlier experiments have produced computers which could design virtual robots and put them through simulated tests, but the Brandeis scientists have gone a step further, connecting a robot-designing computer to a fully-automated machine which can rapidly build each design the software suggests. </p> <p>Commenting on the experiment in Nature, Rodney Brooks, an expert in artificial intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: \"This is a long awaited and necessary step towards the ultimate dream of self-evolving machines.\" </p> <p><strong> Mutations</strong><br> </p> <p>Mr Lipson and Mr Pollack gave their computer the task of developing a robot that would move along the ground as efficiently as possible. The programme responded by producing designs at random, assessing them, and then introducing small mutations to the design to discover if the changes improved the machine's speed and efficiency - imitating the natural process of evolution. \"Typically, several tens of generations passed before the first movement occurred,\" they said. </p> <p>Once the computer had \"evolved\" a moving robot, it tested it in the real world by sending the design to a \"rapid prototyping\" machine which built it from a versatile plastic. The robots emerged from the machine fully-formed apart from the motors, which had to be snapped into place by the scientists. That was the only part played by humans in the process. </p> <p>The computer produced several types of robot which used different methods of motion - some moved sideways like crabs, others swung from side to side, another pulled itself along with two limbs. </p> <p>\"Although both the machines and the task that we describe are fairly simple compared with the products of human teams of engineers (and with the products of biological evolution) we have demonstrated a robotic 'bootstrap' process, in which automatically designed electromechanical systems have been manufactured robotically,\" the report says. </p> <p>If left to their own devices, computers could evolve far faster than living organisms, generating mutations and testing them against the environment in seconds instead of thousands of years. </p> <p>\"I'm not saying a computer can replace an architect - at least not yet,\" Mr Pollack told the New York Times recently. \"But our computer did start with a simple algorithm and end with blueprints for structures that it took humans hundreds of years to develop. And when we built the structures, they were functional.\" </p> <p>Ultimately, he said the technology could be used to build entire factories which would turn out huge numbers of robots \"as cheaply as Sony Walkmans\". </p> <p>The Brandeis scientists argue that to attain artificial life, machines have to gain \"full autonomy\", not only in their behaviour \"but also at the levels of design and fabrication\". \"Only then can we expect synthetic creatures to sustain their own evolution,\" they wrote in Nature. </p> <p>Ominously for anyone who has seen the Terminator films, scientists are not only programming computers with the knowledge that allows them to reproduce, they are also teaching them how to organise. </p> <p>In the same edition of Nature, computer specialists at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland describe how they have taught robots community spirit, by programming them to respond to each other like ants. Based on a few simple \"rules\" a large group of small robots reportedly displayed \"astonishing feats of organisation\". </p> <p>The Swiss scientists found that these insect-like \"antbots\" were more efficient working in groups than they were individually, and suggest that swarms of them could explore unfamiliar or hostile environments. Putting these two breakthroughs together, in theory, planets could be colonised by robots capable of infinitely reproducing themselves. </p> <p><strong>Innovations: Guards and gastrobots</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Thai scientists have just unveiled Roboguard, according to an issue of the New Scientist published today. It totes a laser-sighted gun and can track suspects via infrared sensors. It can fire at will, or it can check with a human via the internet before it attacks. So far the fire command is protected by a password. </p> <p>\"We think the decision to fire should always be a human decision,\" says Pitikhate Sooraksa of King Mongkut's Institute of Technology in Bangkok. \"Otherwise it could kill people.\" </p> <p>\u0095 A Brussels consortium is working on a full-size, autonomous walking robot dinosaur which will stroll round European museums. The creation of the automaton, based on the species Iguanadon atherfieldensis, has involved McNeill Alexander, the British expert on dinosaur biomechanics. But the robot engineers behind the project are stalking a bigger prize: a \"walking\" rescue machine that could step through minefields, over avalanches or collapsed buildings looking for human survivors. </p> <p>\u0095 A flesh-eating robot called Chew Chew could be the first automaton to be completely powered by food. </p> <p>The 12-wheeled \"gastrobot\" was unveiled this month in Hawaii. It uses bacteria to convert food into chemical energy. </p> <p>Meat is the most efficient fuel, but a gastrobot could even mow lawns and use the clippings for fuel. A Bristol team has designed a slug-eating robot, and suggested that a fish-eating robot could monitor beaches for sharks. </p> <p>\u0095 Scientists from New York and Israel have co-operated on a robot surgeon which performs human knee replacement operations. Of 200,000 knee operations in the US each year, 10% need to be done again because of surgical error. The argument is that a human-monitored robot hand would always be steadier, would work in finer detail, and never get tired. Next step: robots for surgery. </p> <p>\u0095 Delaware scientists have designed Flobot the Robot. It can hover on a cushion of air and use magnetic grippers to grab a moving object while hovering over a table. </p> <p>\u0095 Los Alamos scientists have built tiny little four-legged robots which have been tested on fields of unexploded ordnance. If a leg gets blown off, the robot carries on with only three, or two, or one. </p> <p>\u0095 Carnegie Mellon University scientists have built Nomad, an automaton which will search for meteorites in Antarctica.</p>",
  "The vicious loyalist feud in Northern Ireland yesterday saw two dozen homes attacked in Carrickfergus, Co Antrim, ravaged as neighbour targeted neighbour in a night-long orgy of tit-for-tat raids. <p>The Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force disputed who started the trouble.

  "Steven Norris, the defeated Tory candidate for London mayor, found himself at odds yesterday with William Hague, weeks after being drafted into central office to improve the party's image among gay and ethnic minority voters. <p>In his first interview since his summer holiday, the Tory leader said he disagreed with Mr Norris's recent suggestion that gay marriages should be treated equally under the law. </p> <p>Mr Norris underlined his determination to change the Tory party's homophobic image when he said over the weekend that there was \"no moral barrier\" to the civil registration of gay partnerships. </p> <p>The former minister, who in the mayoral contest appealed to voters who had never supported the Tories, said his party needed \"educating\" out of anti-homosexual prejudices. Mr Norris also criticised the use of racially discriminatory language by some of his colleagues. </p> <p>Mr Hague dismissed the remarks by his new vice-chairman in an interview in the Times yesterday, suggesting that Mr Norris may only be allowed to play a token role at central office.

  "David and Victoria Beckham yesterday abandoned their legal battle to stop biographer Andrew Morton revealing details of their private lives in his forthcoming book, entitled Posh and Becks. <p>Outside the high court in London, Suzanne Reeves, solicitor for Mr Morton and his publishers, Michael O'Mara Books, said the Beckhams had mounted an \"extraordinarily aggressive campaign\" against her clients. </p> <p>\"We do not believe that celebrities, particularly those who so actively court favourable publicity, should be able to seek to use the law to silence those who aim to undertake a more objective appraisal of their lives,\" she said. </p> <p>The couple are thought to have agreed not to bring a libel or breach of confidence action over the book in exchange for the deletion of 200 words from the 60,000-word manuscript. This clears the way for publication in October, when the book will compete for sales with Mr Beckham's autobiography, My World, to be published by Hodder Headline around the same time. </p> <p>The couple's lawyer, Michael Tugendhat QC, said the Beckhams had accepted legal advice on \"what the law permits to be published in respect to certain passages\". </p> <p>The couple had objected to information given to Mr Morton by their former bodyguard, Mark Niblett, 40, who stopped working for them in May. They argued that Mr Niblett had breached a confidentiality clause in his contract. </p> <p>Geoffrey Robertson QC, for Mr Morton and his publishers, told Mr Justice Evans-Lombe: \"The claimants may not agree with [the book's] contents, but accept what the law allows in a society which holds fast to free speech principles.\" </p> <p>Confidential details of the settlement were lodged with the court. </p> <p>Michael O'Mara, publisher of Mr Morton's controversial biographies of Princess Diana and Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi, later said he was \"thrilled\" at the settlement, describing it as \"a huge climb-down\" on the part of the England footballer and Spice Girl. </p> <p>\"In the end it all came down to trifling details,\" he said. \"This was a Robert Maxwell-type action: rich and famous people trying to control all press coverage about them through the courts.\" </p> <p>He said the Beckhams' legal challenge had been \"extremely misconceived\", resulting in the deletion of around 200 words in return for invaluable press coverage of the book. </p> <p>\"We could not possibly have bought this much publicity,\" he said. \"The Beckhams have probably tripled the sales and for that I thank them roundly.\" </p> <p>Asked about the book's content, he said: \"Andrew was interested in the business of celebrity and how modern celebrities use their fame. Andrew thinks this new form of celebrity is not necessarily all for the good. He wanted to write about it.\" </p> <p>Mr O'Mara hinted that the book would centre more on Victoria Beckham than on her husband, whom he described as a \"straightforward\" man who likes cars and clothes. </p> <p>\"Unlike him she hasn't got an abundance of natural talent at something, but she's taken what she's got and made a hell of a lot more of it. In the book Andrew shows how he admires Victoria for her business skills. She is possibly one of Britain's top businesswomen.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the couple said: \"David and Victoria Beckham had never planned to ban Andrew Morton's book but had wanted to stop a former employee from revealing details about their private lives. </p> <p>\"A sensible compromise has been reached... clarifying which matters Mr Morton and his publishers are and aren't entitled to publish.\" </p> <p>She added: \"The case against Mark Niblett continues.\"</p>",
  "A \u00a37m advertising campaign reflecting the harrowing situations confronted by police officers was launched yesterday in a bold effort to recruit thousands into the service at a time when overall numbers are at their lowest for a decade. <p>The first of three TV commercials with the theme \"Could you?\" was due to be broadcast during peak viewing time last night, marking the first stage of a three year marketing drive masterminded by the London agency M&amp;C Saatchi. </p> <p>The first advert features the Falklands war veteran Simon Weston. \"People say I'm brave. I've had to deal with a lot in my life,\" he says. \"But to go round to somebody's house to tell a man that his wife and child have been killed by some drunken idiot in a car crash... I'm not sure I could do that.\" </p> <p>The actress Patsy Palmer - who played Bianca Butcher in the BBC soap EastEnders - and the former England footballer John Barnes describe different challenges in two other films. </p> <p>The government is hoping this first national campaign will ease the recruitment crisis facing a service which has been battered by bad publicity in recent years and is suffering from poor morale. </p> <p>Although the Home Office has set aside cash to recruit 9,000 extra officers nationwide over the next three years, the increase will only be meaningful if forces can retain the staff they have. </p> <p>Figures released yesterday showed the number of police officers in England and Wales had dropped from 127,158 in 1997 to 124,418 in March this year. </p> <p>The Metropolitan police has warned if the haemorrhage continues, it will soon have its lowest number of officers on record. </p> <p>M&amp;C Saatchi was set the task of devising a campaign which would lift the spirits of existing officers while encouraging the right calibre of potential recruits in the key 25 to 35 age group. </p> <p>Although the TV ads are hardhitting, the home secretary, Jack Straw, and Paul Whitehouse, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers, insisted they were not negative. </p> <p>\"We have to show in an honest way the challenges facing police officers,\" said Mr Whitehouse, who was an adviser to the agency. </p> <p>\"We had to get away from the type of adverts which say 'Join the police and become a chief constable in three weeks' or 'Join and drive a fast car'. If someone is put off policing by the advertisments, then they are probably not the sort of person we need.\" </p> <p>Mr Straw said he asked the agency about the defensive tone of the commercials but was assured they had been well received in sampling, especially by the young. </p> <p>He said the police needed to recruit officers who relied on brain rather than brawn. \"The purpose of our campaign is simple. It is to help local forces attract recruits of the highest quality and expertise over the next three years.\" </p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, yesterday said the fall in police numbers was an embarrassment for the government. </p> <p>\"Jack Straw can embark on all the photo opportunities he wants. There is no denying that the thin blue line has got thinner. Jack Straw promised to increase police numbers. He has failed to deliver.\" </p> <p>Fred Broughton, chairman of the Police Federation, welcomed the campaign but said it was only a start. \"More needs to be done to halt the decline in police numbers. We have been calling for extra resources to boost manpower for the last 10 years. But something is at last being done.\" </p> <p><b>Where low-cost homes make hearts beat faster</b></p> <p>\"Has Heartbeat started again then?\" said the recruitment office at Newby Wiske hall, where North Yorkshire police are finely tuned to the effects of the nostalgic TV series on weary Metropolitan colleagues' minds. </p> <p>The quiet scrapping of a gentleman's agreement between forces not to poach serving officers from elsewhere has lent a big hand to solving manpower problems for chief constables with rural and low-cost housing beats. </p> <p>North Yorkshire, which includes two national parks and a wealth of villages out of commuter range, has taken on 24 experienced officers from other forces since placing its first advertisement for transfers earlier this year. Another eight are in the pipeline, along with 45 new recruits without previous policing experience. </p> <p>\"It has traditionally been the case that you did not advertise for people to transfer,\" said a spokesman for the North Yorkshire force. \"But the chief constables decided to drop their unwritten agreement and we put an advertisement in a police publication. We have lost two officers transferring out to other forces, but the balance is heavily in our direction.\" </p> <p>The end of the \"no poaching\" agreement this year has started to free the internal market in police manpower, according to the Police Federation, although no change in the law or force regulations has been involved. </p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Officers have always applied for transfers for various reasons, particularly the cost of housing in some parts of the country, but it has not been officially encouraged until now.\" </p> <p>The Association of Chief Police Officers said that the bar on advertising had been \"understood, never written down\", but chief constables had finally decided to end it. </p> <p>Demand for police jobs is not entirely a matter of fine landscapes, with a largely urban force like West Yorkshire receiving 2,000 letters of interest for 60 recently advertised jobs for newrecruits. </p> <p>But North Yorkshire said: \"There definitely is a Heartbeat factor. An awful lot of colleagues from elsewhere want to work on the North York moors.\"</p>",
  "When the presiding judge, Lord Sutherland, granted another short adjournment to the Lockerbie trial yesterday, as defence and prosecution counsel tussled over access to CIA cables, there was clear regret in the judge's voice. <p>The biggest mass murder trial in British history has been beset by delays from the outset, but the current delay centres on a crucial witness whose testimony may decide whether the case against the two Libyans accused of the bombing stands or falls. </p> <p>Since the Scottish court in the Netherlands reconvened last week, everyone has been awaiting the evidence of defector Abdul Majid Razkaz Salam Giaka, codenamed Puzzle Piece WF 140440 by the US witness protection scheme. </p> <p>But after legal argument yesterday it became apparent the wait will be lengthened: over the next month the CIA will search its files for transcripts of its agents' dealings with Mr Giaka. When that task is completed, Mr Giaka looks set to become the crown's last - and most vital - witness in the case over the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988, which killed 270 people. </p> <p>As the trial has progressed the importance to the prosecution of the man who operated as a double agent while working at Malta's Luqa airport alongside Abdel Baset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah, the Libyans accused of the murders, has become increasingly apparent. </p> <p>A succession of witnesses who failed to live up to expectations has heightened the crown's reliance on Mr Giaka. One witness mistook a Palestinian terrorist for a defendant in a photo line-up. A star witness, Edwin Bollier, who was intended to link the accused Libyans to the bomb's detonator, changed his story with such frequency that even the crown questioned his credibility. </p> <p>\"The crown have yet to lead evidence from a witness who says they saw al-Megrahi or Fhimah make the bomb, put it in a suitcase and load it on to the plane at Malta. They haven't even established - beyond the notion of a theoretical possibility - that the bomb was even put on the plane in Malta. They need Giaka to do that,\" said Robert Black QC, the Edinburgh law professor who first proposed holding the trial in the Netherlands. </p> <p>But there is growing concern that Mr Giaka's testimony will not live up to that promised as far back as 1991. </p> <p>Initially, Mr Giaka was expected to give evidence by the middle of last week. It became obvious last Tuesday, however, that there would be delays. </p> <p>At the start of June, the prosecution met CIA officials in the US embassy in the Hague and had first sight of the unedited cables. Those present guaranteed not to make notes or disclose any of the information in the cables. The defence was given no such access: they saw only transcripts with large areas blacked out by the pen of an American censor. </p> <p>Then, at the start of last week, the defence discovered the discrepancy. Under the European convention on human rights, already incorporated into Scots law, the defence and prosecution must have equality of arms. The defence counsel, Richard Keen QC and William Taylor QC, demanded unedited versions of the cables. </p> <p>The lord advocate, Colin Boyd QC, said the blacked out sections were of no relevance to the defence and could not be revealed without endangering America's national security. The judges disagreed and told Mr Boyd to approach the CIA and ask for unedited version of the cables to be made available to the defence. </p> <p>\"The defence couldn't realistically cross examine Giaka without seeing what his CIA handlers had to say about him. This is vitally important stuff,\" said Prof Black. </p> <p>In an unprecedented step, the CIA agreed to release the cables. By Friday, Mr Keen, counsel for Fhimah, had made a first assessment of them. He told the court the idea they did not impinge on his client's defence was inconceivable. </p> <p>On Monday, as classified US intelligence documents were produced for the first time in a foreign court, the relevance of the cables was becoming apparent. One of the names in a cable was a pseudonym for a defence witness. They contained details of payments that could be given to Mr Giaka in return for giving evidence. Mr Taylor, counsel for al-Megrahi, asked for an adjournment to consider his client's defence. </p> <p>As the court reconvened on Tuesday, defence lawyers demanded that all classified American intelligence documents relating to Mr Giaka be passed to the court. Lord Sutherland rejected a defence request that the court ask the US attorney general, Janet Reno, to appoint a federal judge to examine all the CIA documents and make available everything that was not a threat to national security. But Mr Boyd was told to go back to the CIA and ask directly for the documents. </p> <p>Yesterday, the CIA agreed to search its files for documents concerning Mr Giaka. Again, it will take the unusual step of making public intelligence information on the Libyan's status as a double agent - and, crucially, the groups and individuals the defence claims are responsible for the bombing. </p> <p>Meanwhile, further details about Mr Giaka emerged. Under codename P1, he was paid $1,000 a month for information by American intelligence agents. However, the CIA threatened to stop payment in September 1989, nine months after the Lockerbie bombing, unless he came up with better information about JSO, the Libyan intelligence service. </p> <p>Before he even takes to the stand, such information - coupled with his eligibility for a $4m (about \u00a32.75m) reward on conviction of the two accused - threatens to undermine Mr Giaka's credibility. </p> <p>Legal sources are beginning to wonder to what extent he will directly link the accused to the bombing. In the late 1980s, Mr Giaka worked for Libyan Arab Airways alongside the accused at Luqa airport. He admits to being a member of Libyan intelligence services; al-Megrahi and Fhimah are accused of being Libyan spies. After he defected to the US in July 1991, he gave testimony to the FBI which formed a key part of the indictment issued in November of that year. He went into hiding. In the years that have passed he is said to have become increasingly paranoid. </p> <p>When defence solicitors went to take a precognition (witness statement) before the trial, he insisted they were blindfolded. Mr Giaka wore make-up and a Shirley Bassey wig. It is understood the solicitors came away lacking the confidence in Mr Giaka which the prosecution must have in court. </p> <p>But the testimony he gives -in a disguised voice, behind screens - will be pivotal. \"His evidence is absolutely vital,\" said a legal source. \"If he fails to directly blame the Libyans, at the very least the defence will claim no case to answer and the whole thing could end much sooner than anyone expected.\"</p>",
  "Partners in City of London law firms earn more than \u00a31m a year, according to a survey of lawyers' incomes.

  "\u0095 If you had \u00a3250,000 going spare, should you blow it on a new Corniche? That is the question we address today, as we review the car so bravely lent us by Rolls-Royce and events ensuing after Gerald Kaufman, Richard Adams and myself arrived on Friday morning at Crewe. <p>Our museum tour guide and tutor on the car's controls, former machinist John Spragg, mentioned visits from Nigel Mansell (\"lovely man, fascinating, and hilarious\") and Mike Tyson (\"lovely man, very knowledgable about our history\"). Beginning the journey to Leeds, all three of us admiring the plushness of the sheepskin carpets and the 76 buttons to move the seats, and it was not until 33 minutes had elapsed that a Beatles tape (the Red Album) became stuck ... and, in trying to fix it, I yanked off the front of the cassette player. </p> <p>\u0095 \"Baby you can drive my car,\" as John Lennon puts it on that album, \"Yes, I'm gonna be a star.\" Well no, I'm not. You're not going to be a star of motoring journalism, are you, if on level seven of Leeds' Schofield NCP car park you drive an automatic Corniche into a wall. Still, in a certain light (candle) you'd barely notice.</p> <p> \u0095 The thing about driving a navy blue open-top Corniche with cream leather interior through areas of urban deprivation is that you do get noticed. Yet there was little hostility ... just the one \"wanker\" hand gesture. \"What has happened to the class envy that made Britain what it was?\" mused Richard. What happened to tall poppy syndrome? </p> <p>\u0095 Gerald Kaufman loved the airy boot, I enjoyed the superb suspension and the smoothness of the seven litre engine, and Richard was struck by the speed of cigar lighter. \"Isn't it amazing, what they can do these days for \u00a3250,000?\" he said. However, he was upset by the lack of a cigar compartment light.</p> <p> \u0095 To Stephen Corley who wrote of seeing RR1 \"on the hard shoulder of the M1 with hazard lights flashing\" late on Friday, what happened was this. For some reason, John Spragg omitted from his \"cockpit drill\" any warning against selecting reverse at nearly 90mph. The car snatched up sharply and lost all power, and \"check gearbox\" flashed up. A lovely moment. We rested on the hard shoulder, nervily restarted the car, went into drive and drew away. What a car to recover so quickly. </p> <p>\u0095 The real question for anyone with \u00a3250,000, then, is have you got the nerve? I haven't. Although the car survived a night in Shepherds Bush, the next morning it went to a gentler suburb until they came to collect it on Tuesday - by which point the Spirit of Ecstasy emblem was stuck in the retracted position and the alarm system had broken. A quiet weekend, then, for RR1. As for the Diary, its career as a car reviewer ends at this apex. Richard is now working on borrowing a yacht. </p>",
  "The home secretary Jack Straw is considering new powers to tackle the rising violence by animal rights extremists who target the scientific community, it was confirmed yesterday. <p>Mr Straw is planning a full review of police powers to combat what he described as the\"preposterous\" and \"terrible\" activities of some extremists. </p> <p>Scientists who met Home Office officials last month called for urgent action to clamp down on the violence against the homes and property of scientists and major shareholders in laboratories using animal testing. </p> <p>Mr Straw said police were also calling for more powers to curtail protesters' activities after police figures showed 1,200 reports of animal rights attacks last year alone, causing an estimated \u00a32.6m damage to property. But animal rights campaigners said criminal laws were already in place to deal with violent protesters. </p> <p>Mr Straw told Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are looking at whether there are changes in legislation that we can take which are being sought by the police to see whether we can strengthen action against these animal rights extremists. </p> <p>\"It is worth bearing in mind that many of us would not be able to lead healthy lives were it not for the pharmaceutical companies being able to test their drugs on animals.\" </p> <p>The announcement follows a spate of violence against laboratory staff, culminating in the explosion on Monday of petrol bombs under five cars belonging to employees of Huntingdon Life Sciences, a research centre in Cambridgeshire.</p>",
  "<b>No shrinking violet</b> <p>At one of the Edinburgh Television Festival's more heated debates, Dr Raj Persaud, a consultant psychiatrist who once stood in for an ailing Esther Rantzen, warned of the possible psychological damage facing the Big Brother contestants. </p> <p>\"It's like putting an alcoholic on a drinking game show\", he said. \"These people are obsessed with becoming famous and so are not making decisions that are in their own best interests.\" </p> <p>While no one would underestimate the agonies of the Big Brother victims as they resign themselves to a lifetime of showering in private, there must surely be more immediate concern for the well-being of Persaud, a man whose enthusiasm for the public eye makes the game show exhibitionists look like so many shrinking Miss Havishams. </p> <p>For some time many of us have been worried that Persaud does not always make decisions that are in his best interests. </p> <p>Should this bright young winner of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' research prize and medal really be squandering quite so much of his talent on Richard and Judy's Good Morning show, where he is the \"resident psychiatrist\"? </p> <p>Does the author of a paper called \"Psychiatrists suffer from stigma too\" help his profession by writing multiple-choice How to Know Yourself quizzes for the Telegraph, by contributing features to every national broadsheet and by broadcasting, what seems incessantly, on Radio 4 - speaking of which, don't miss his next contribution, the Science of Humour (trailed in a half-page feature he wrote for last Tuesday's Daily Telegraph). </p> <p>Nor should we forget his regular column in Cosmopolitan, his contributions to Men's Health magazine and his - well, anyone interested in exploring the extremity of Persaud's love affair with the media would do best to check out the biography on his internet home page, in which he lists his contributions and includes a few of the choicer compliments to have come his way since he first began to entertain us, back in the early 90s: \"The Independent on Sunday said he was 'The undisputed king of the media shrink pack' and the Spectator in 1998 asserted he is 'the most eminent psychiatrist of the age... he is the guru of common sense.'\" </p> <p>Whether through this very abundance of common sense or through lack of space, the king of the shrinks' website does not mention his sideline as a media quotesman for all occasions, nor does he begin to itemise his numerous contributions to tabloid newspapers, in particular the Sunday People, with which he seems to have some sort of special relationship. </p> <p>Not long ago he provided psychiatric input for a piece which asked (re Neil Morrissey) \"Why do girls fall for men behaving badly?\" \"Many women put up with men behaving badly because they love the rollercoaster ride of emotion,\" explained Persaud. \"There is never a dull moment. And when he does give his lover attention she feels more euphoric than if he had been eating out of her hand from the start.\" </p> <p>To his credit, the doctor appears to be in control of his former habit of analysing celebrities he had never met, but there is no room for complacency: weeks ago he could not resist offering the Sun his thoughts on the perils (re Robbie Williams) of celebrity dating: \"Celebrities have difficulty maintaining relationships with each other because they are always very busy, jetting all over the world and so on.\" </p> <p>More worrying than this idiosyncratic application of his skills, however, is the emergence of certain inconsistencies in Persaud's clinical thinking. Earlier this year the Independent asked for his views on the sitcom psychiatrist Frasier. Persaud was damning: \"Frasier doesn't ask the questions that we would ask, and he doesn't get the proper background to make an accurate prognosis.\" Which is not what he told the Mirror about Frasier in 1997: \"I used to do a regular phone-in slot on a radio station and identify with him.\" </p> <p>Which Persaud is the true one? The one who identifies with Frasier, or the one who does not? The ubiquitous showman or the earnest clinician? The contributor to Schizophrenia Research or the Cosmo agony uncle? </p> <p>When the Big Brother show comes to an end the producers should not repine: all they need do is replace their 10 contestants with Persaud and let his multiple personalities fight it out. </p> <p><b>With this chocolate flake, I thee wed</b> </p> <p> From Max Clifford to the Sun, from Garry Bushell to the president of Family and Youth Concern, the forces of righteousness unite in horror over the Bovey-Turner nuptials. Not, as might once have happened, because the groom abandoned his three small daughters for love of the refulgent former lottery show presenter, but because the institution of marriage is thought to have been tainted by the presence of confectionery.</p> <p>Although it is unappealing, the degree of outrage seems disproportionate. Are the happy pair not looking forward to a future of shared mastication? </p> <p>Moreover, given that they had already auctioned their intimacy, Mr and Mrs Anthea Snowflake - and their many Hello! and OK! predecessors - seem to have shown unusual restraint. Any celebrity couple wanting to make the most of this special promotional day will naturally want to exploit every one of its marketing opportunities. What is a wedding dress, for example, if not a gigantic empty hoarding, with space for 1,000 times the number of logos that conventionally adorn the suits of formula one drivers? In future the Snowflakes may come to feel they sold away their wedding rights for something less than a mess of pottage, to wit: two crumbly white flakes covered in milk chocolate, each containing 200 calories, 2.7g protein, 22.2g. carbohydrate and 11.4g fat. </p> <p><b> Paedologists beware</b></p> <p>No sooner had David Blunkett announced his national spelling bee, than the behaviour of vandals in Newport suggested that knowing how to place letters in the correct sequence might not in itself be enough. Not long ago, the oafs who forced a woman paediatrician from her home, believing her to be a pervert, probably had as much difficulty with spelling paedophile as they would have done with the more commonplace accommodation, or millennium or desperate. </p> <p>Now - thanks, no doubt to the News of the World - they have memorised the correct spelling of \"paedo\", without grasping that other words beginning with the same prefix might mean something different. Happily, not too many other words start this way, though paedologists in the Newport area should be on their guard. Ditto peddlers and podiatrists. And anyone trying to make a living by letting out those charming little pleasure boats called pedalos might like to consider switching to punts. </p> <p>If Rebekah Wade is interested in making amends this might be a good time to feature a little etymology item in her paper, for readers who wish to persecute sex offenders but lack the required literacy.</p>",
  "A wry smile plays across the face of the fair-haired young man as he explains his feelings about asylum-seekers. \"When refugees are no longer in need they should go home but they don't and that's the problem. About 6,000 come here every year and if they bring their families that can add up to as many as 16,000 people.\" <p>Such views have struck a chord with many in Austria and eastern Germany but this is Denmark, a country whose liberal tolerant society has long been the envy of the world. But things are starting to change. The young man is Carl Christian Ebbesen, a board member of the ultra-nationalist Danish People's party (DPP) whose popularity ratings were as high as 15% earlier this year. The DPP's staunch opposition to Denmark ditching the krone in favour of the euro in next month's referendum has done wonders for its image and won it new-found respectability. </p> <p>Its leader, the 53-year-old self-styled housewife Pia Kjaersgaard revelled in a public one-on-one debate with the Danish prime minister, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, on the euro last week. An elfin-like blonde lady and mother of two, she does not look like a demagogue. But appearances can be deceiving and the core policies of the DPP or the Dansk Folkeparti as it is known in Danish are far from respectable. </p> <p>If it ever does win power, Denmark's reputation as a liberal society would be shattered forever. Aid to the third world would be privatised and poor countries forced to take action to \"restrict population growth\" if they wanted to receive any help. Recidivist paedophiles would find themselves forced to undergo \"medical castration\" and the criteria for Danish citizenship would be severely tightened. </p> <p>Refugees should, the DPP argues, be repatriated to their country of origin and only small numbers provisionally accepted. \"Denmark is not a country intended for immigration and the Danish People's party disagrees with the statement that Denmark will develop into a multi-ethnic society,\" the party's programme reads. </p> <p>The party is also hostile to the EU and would like to see the European Parliament, where it has one MEP, abolished. </p> <p>Just 4.5% of Denmark's population of 5.3 million is made up of immigrants but the DPP has shown itself adept at whipping up popular anti-EU and anti-foreigner sentiment. </p> <p>In 1998 Pia Kjaersgaard urged Danes to rally at Denmark's border with Germany and protest at cooperation between Jutland and Germany's Schleswig Holstein region. According to Bendt Bendtsen, the leader of the Danish Conservative party, the \"cooperation\" involved only minor activities such as student exchanges and a joint ambulance service. It was portrayed, however, \"as a joint EU-German attempt to regain control over old German territory in Denmark.\" </p> <p>Mr Bendtsen adds: \"It was tasteless, but by playing this tune on nationalistic strings they have distorted public discussion in Denmark to a point where a real dialogue is no longer possible.\" </p> <p>Former EU commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard warned last week that if Danes say 'nej' to the euro next month it will be seen as a swing to the DPP. Earlier this month even J\u00f6rg Haider's Freedom party refused to meet with Kjaersgaard. </p> <p>Yet the DPP is a real political force in Denmark. It polled 7.4% of the vote in the last parliamentary elections in 1998 and has 13 MPs in the Folketing (parliament). Now suggestions are growing that it may soon be in a strong enough position to prop up a centre-right government in exchange for a slice of power.</p>",
  "Sweeping new controls on information, including details of a proposed new European paramilitary police force, have been ratified by EU governments. <p>The new EU secrecy code was agreed earlier this month by \"written procedure\", preventing any debate by the European parliament. It became part of EU law on August 23. </p> <p>The code was drawn up in secret by the EU security supremo, Javier Solana, who is also secretary-general of the EU council of ministers, in cooperation with his successor as Nato secretary-general, Lord Roberston. </p> <p>The controls were rushed through despite opposition from the European ombudsman, Jacob Soderman, who warned this week that the code could be applied to policy areas presently open to public scrutiny. </p> <p>When Tony Bunyan, editor of Statewatch, the British-based civil liberties bulletin, asked in July for details of the Solana plan, he was told by a senior EU council official that the release of such information \"could fuel public discussion on this subject\". </p> <p>Under the Solana plan, all classified documents relating to \"security and defence of the union or one or more of its member states\", or to \"military or non-military crisis management\", will be permanently excluded from public scrutiny. </p> <p>The blanket secrecy rules will cover proposals to set up a 5,000-strong EU paramilitary police force as well as plans for a rapid reaction force. They could cover all EU discussions on criminal justice, border controls and trade policy. </p> <p>The code will also enable Nato and non-EU governments to veto the disclosure of EU documents. </p> <p>Documents passed to State watch show that the plans go much much further than purely military operations. </p> <p>The commission says the proposed rapid reaction force could be used to quell \"growing violence destabilising law and order, breaches of the peace, outbreaks of fighting, armed conflicts\" and \"massive population movements\". </p> <p>Documents which would have been suppressed under the new controls include minutes of a meeting of paramilitary police from Spain, Portugal, France and Italy in January at which they discussed the creation of a \"European security and investigation force\" as a \"tool\" at the disposal of the EU and Nato. </p> <p>Paramilitary police forces, they say, are particularly qualified for the \"restoration of public security\", providing capabilities for \"intelligence, general surveillance, judicial police [and] maintaining order\".</p>",
  "Three young neo-Nazis were yesterday convicted of a vicious race murder, in a case that has brought to a head the German government's concern over the far right's activities in the east of the country. <p>The widow of their victim, Mozambique-born Alberto Adriano, stayed away from the hearing at a court in the eastern city of Halle after receiving a death threat. </p> <p>The court sentenced Enrico Hilprecht, 24, to the maximum of life in prison. His two 16-year-old co-defendants, Christian Richter and Frank Miethbauer, were each given nine years in jail, one year less than the maximum sentence for juveniles. </p> <p>The judge called the deadly assault on June 11 \"the latest in a long chain of attacks to which we must put an end\". </p> <p>Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, called yesterday for the speedy imposition of a ban on the radical far-right National Democratic party of Germany (NPD). The government has moved gradually towards supporting a ban, despite the misgivings of its interior minister, Otto Schily. </p> <p>Critics, including senior officials in the counter-intelligence service, have argued that such a ban would merely make surveillance of the neo-Nazi scene more difficult. </p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der will today lay a wreath at a memorial erected at the spot where Adriano was attacked so savagely that he later died of his wounds. The killing was the third this year alleged to have been carried out by members of the far right. </p> <p>The court was told that the younger defendants had previous convictions for daubing swastikas. </p> <p>Tolerance of neo-Nazi violence is widespread in eastern Germany, especially among the young. In an effort to end this tolerance, the chancellor yesterday appealed to east Germans' pride in their recent history, encouraging them to take a stand like the one that put an end to communist rule in 1989. </p> <p>He said Germany needed a \"repeat of what people in the east of our country recognised in the peaceful revolution 10 years ago\", adding that the easterners had to \"involve themselves and fight for the right thing\". </p> <p>In Dessau, where Adriano was killed, police said his German-born widow had received a threatening letter which the public prosecutor's office was investigating. A spokesman for a foreigners' rights group said she had decided not to attend the final session of the court because she was \"simply too scared because of her children\". </p> <p>Mr Adriano, who was 39 and worked in a meat packing plant, left behind him three children, of whom the youngest is six months old. </p> <p>His killers yesterday sat expressionless in court yesterday as the verdict was read out. </p> <p>The defence had pleaded for shorter jail terms and for manslaughter or deadly assault charges, saying prosecutors had failed to prove that the attackers intended to kill Adriano when they set on him in a park after a drunken rampage through the city. </p> <p>A defence lawyer, Sabine Grunow, said all of the accused expressed regret in brief closing statements at the end of the four-day trial. Hearings were closed to the public because of German law regarding juveniles. </p> <p>Adriano was walking home in the early hours of the morning, when the three attacked him, screaming racist abuse. When they had kicked him unconscious, they stripped him of his clothes as a final humiliation. </p> <p>In a further instance of racist violence, prosecutors in the northern town of L\u00fcbeck said they had arrested two skinheads for attacking and injuring a 33-year-old African man whom they had taunted with racial slurs. </p> <p>Police in the German town of Waiblingen detained two men after two foreigners were slightly injured in an early-morning arson attack on a home for asylum seekers. </p> <p>Late on Tuesday, a 21-year-old German man was given a five-month suspended sentence and fined 500DM (\u00a3160) for punching a Hong Kong-born photojournalist who was trying to cover racism in the east.</p>",
  "The French are unconcerned about the British influx into their rural midst - half a million according to Abbey National - but second home buying within the United Kingdom itself is controversial. Particularly in north Wales, some parts of Scotland, the Lake District and Cornwall, where up to a third of local dwellings are owned by seasonal visitors. <p>The 1990 census said England and Wales had 92,000 second homes. A more realistic estimate is closer to 250,000. They are concentrated in, for example, Wales. Some 13% of all second homes in England and Wales are in Wales, which has only 6% of all dwellings, as the chart shows. That translates into between 26,000 and 32,000 properties owned and used by \"non-residents\". </p> <p>This causes problems not faced elsewhere in Europe. Within the UK, second home ownership evokes questions of social equality, social rights and justice. On the continent these are rarely associated with the second home phenomenon, even where concentrations of non-resident owners are heaviest. While 3% of households in the UK have second homes, figures elsewhere are consistently above 4 or 5%. In Denmark, more than 10% of households have a second home, while in Sweden, the figure is closer to 25%. But there, population densities are lower and the amount of available housing is generally higher. Scandinavian second homes are regarded in much the same way as a second car. </p> <p>There are housing markets where incomers and locals compete, for example the Swedish west coast - though the issue in Sweden has more to do with the cultural shock of a sudden wave of foreign (German) buyers coming into the domestic property market. </p> <p>In the UK low rural wages may make housing unaffordable. More affluent incomers out-bid locals. This means, so the argument goes, that second homes damage communities. Locals are displaced and the seasonal nature of the new population means that villages become ghost communities: village shop, post office and pub become redundant. In parts of Wales, displacement is viewed as a threat to Welsh, making the issue all the more emotive. </p> <p>The ghost community notion possesses intrinsic political appeal. But in Wales as elsewhere, those on low incomes compete for housing against affluent locals, retirement migrants, commuters and teleworkers and it is often difficult to isolate the impact of second homes. Similarly, the assumption gets made that young people do wish to remain in rural communities, in spite of a lack of jobs, services and educational opportunities. There is an idea, too, that people have a natural right to live and own property in a particular place. </p> <p>Second homes may contribute to a general lifting of house prices. But they may also signal continued investment in rural communities in the face of economic decline. </p> <p>In Wales pressure to restrict second home buying has been building for 30 years. In the late 60s and early 70s, summer homes and static caravans became a focus for ranting and arson. By the 80s, the issue had reached the mainstream agenda. Today, the machinery which might offer greater control over second homes seems to be in place in the form of the national assembly for Wales. </p> <p>Rumours that the assembly might be considering giving councils such powers was interpreted by some as a move to keep out the English. In fact, the assembly had merely raised concern over the effects of second homes in rural and coastal tourist areas. Its task force, looking at rural housing issues, has advocated research into questions of market access, stock condition and affordability rather than changing planning law. </p> <p>The point, though, is that such powers are now available in Wales. In future, the assembly might be able to amend secondary legislation to distinguish between first and secondary residences. As of now they have no identity in planning law, meaning that a user is free to live in a residential property permanently or simply use it during odd weekends in the summer. Reform might involve making a distinction, as in Denmark. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, people frequently used their second homes for seasonal and recreational purposes. Today, a great many more make use of modern technology and choose to work from their second home, blurring the distinction between principal and seasonal residence. For employment purposes these days (for a few), geography may not matter. </p> <p>However the political arguments go, it is worth saying that second homes usually make an insignificant impact compared to commuters or retirement migrants. The bigger challenges facing rural areas relate to economic competitiveness and job creation. There must be a clear onus on local authorities to demonstrate that it is second homes rather than other types of buyers or economic issues that are causing the disadvantage experienced by locals. Second homes in other words are less significant than the social processes leading more people to work from home, commute over longer distances, or retire earlier. </p> <p>Perhaps something needs to be done to aid those communities where younger residents have difficulty finding homes. But this assistance should not just focus on housing. They need answers on the economic and school fronts and on services that will encourage those who wish to remain in the countryside to stay. </p> <p> Nick Gallent is at University College London; Mark Tewdwr-Jones at the University of Aberdeen.

  "John Mullan admits (Law of the letter, August 30) that Dr Johnson's dictionary destroyed the previous free choice in English spellings, yet he makes the common mistake of assuming that it is only laziness or bad teaching which are responsible for difficulties with spelling. <p>The underlying assumption is also that an ability to spell denotes absolute intelligence, when it is actually the result of good visual memory - whether innate or trained. Indeed, \"intelligence\" itself is not an absolute, but is constructed from various facilities. </p> <p>Logic, numerical ease, spatial intelligence, visual recall, aural memory - all are parts of intelligence, but most of us do not possess all of them together. If David Blunkett demanded that all children should be able to draw 200 artefacts and creatures by a certain age, we would recoil, because we accept that drawing is something people can or cannot do. Spelling, however, has acquired a social status harking back to the superiority of the educated classes. </p> <p>Attempting to teach the chaotic and unruly spelling of English in an age when so many children's visual memories are more in contact with screens than with the letters on a page, is not an enviable task. I've done it, and believe me, it is nothing to sneer at. </p> <p><b>Tony Vinicombe </b><br> Shoreham, W Sussex  <a href=\"mailto:ViniView@aol.com\"> ViniView@aol.com</a> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 An interesting conjunction on your front page (August 30): \"Schools hit by teacher jobs crisis\" and \"Doctor driven out of home by vigilantes\".

  "President Bill Clinton flew into Colombia yesterday amid a countrywide outbreak of rebel violence and protests against a massive boost in US military aid to the government. <p>Leftwing guerrillas attacked police stations and army posts, bombs exploded outside banks and masked students clashed with riot police. </p> <p>The violence took place mostly around the three main cities and in rural areas hundreds of miles from Cartagena, the Caribbean tourist resort where 5,000 troops, 350 US agents, helicopter gunships and an American aircraft carrier provided security for Mr Clinton's nine-hour visit. </p> <p>On Tuesday night, rebels attacked 12 police stations in six of the country's 32 departments. Five civilians, including two children, died when guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) rained mortar bombs on a police station in the village of La Bateca, near the border with Venezuela. </p> <p>In south-west Cali, the second largest city, Farc guerrillas detonated bombs outside three banks, causing widespread damage but no injuries, police said. </p> <p>In the north-eastern oil- producing province of Arauca, another Farc unit attacked an army barracks near the town of Fortul on Tuesday afternoon, injuring six soldiers, an army spokeswoman said. Guerrillas also attacked an army post in the nearby town of Saravena. US-made Blackhawk helicopters flew to the region to strike back at the rebel column. </p> <p>Rebel commanders have denounced the US aid package, which includes 60 helicopters, equipment and training for the Colombian army, saying that money will cause an escalation in the civil war, and eventually US-backed military action against the guerrillas. </p> <p>\"Clinton isn't here to support social investment but a military plan. We don't want to make threats, but the Colombian people have the rights to take to the streets and protest against this visit,\" the Farc commander, Andres Paris, told the Guardian. </p> <p>In a videotaped address to the Colombian people broadcast on Tuesday night, Mr Clinton stressed the social development programmes included in the aid package, and denied that Washington planned military intervention. </p> <p>\"We have no military objective. We do not believe your conflict has a military solution. We support the peace process. Our approach is both pro-peace and anti-drug,\" Mr Clinton said. </p> <p>Yesterday the Miami Herald reported that the Pentagon is planning to send an army general to oversee the military element of the aid package. </p> <p>According to US law, a maximum of 500 American troops and 300 civilian contractors may be in Colombia at any time, but the president may waive the limit in the event of an \"imminent involvement\" of US forces in hostilities. </p> <p>The largest chunk of American money will pay for 60 helicopters to support a military offensive in the rebel-dominated jungles of southern Colombia, where most of the world's cocaine is produced. The helicopters and three US-trained anti-narcotics army battalions will lead the advance, securing control of drug plantations to allow the police to eradicate illegal crops. </p> <p>Mr Clinton waived strict human rights conditions to approve the aid last week, despite fears that the Colombian military maintains close ties with illegal rightwing paramilitary groups. </p> <p>In its 1999 report, the state department reported \"credible allegations of co-operation with paramiltary groups, including both silent support and direct collaboration.\" </p> <p>Monitoring groups in Colombia fear that the American money will exacerbate the country's 35-year civil war and cause up to 200,000 people to flee their homes. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cicad.oas.org/\" target=\"_new\">Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/colombia_197_bgn.html\" target=\"_new\">US state department: Colombia</a><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.presidencia.gov.co/\" target=\"_new\">Government of Colombia</a></p>",
  "The largest edible crabs in the world, growing to one and a half metres across, have invaded northern Norway from Russia and spawned a new and valuable fishing industry. <p>King crabs as they are known, hundreds of thousands of them, are marching west along the Barents Sea and heading south towards the rest of Europe. </p> <p>To the fishermen of northern Norway they are both a boon and a menace. The bonus comes because they are worth \u00a3150 each at Oslo fishmongers. The problem is that there are so many juvenile crabs - too small to eat - that hundreds of them are caught at a time and they weigh down and break the nets of trawlers. Often cod fishermen catch more crabs than fish. </p> <p>The crabs originally came from the Kamchatka peninsula on the extreme eastern side of Russia, in cold Arctic waters. In an experiment in the 1960s a Russian scientist, without consulting the Norwegians, introduced them into a fjord in the Barents Sea. The area is so cold that there are no native crabs there, but the king crabs found it a home from home and thrived. </p> <p>The first the Norwegians knew about them was in 1980, when a few were caught in cod nets. A huge colony has now established itself in Varanger fjord, the biggest in Norway, which is renowned for its cod and haddock. The crabs there regularly reach 1.5 metres (five feet) across - bigger than in their native waters in Asia. </p> <p>The crabs have already marched 600 miles (1,000 kilometres) west of Varanger, round the coast to Tromso, and have now turned south. </p> <p>The Russians and Norwegians, who share all fish catches in the Barents Sea, realise that they have a new resource with valuable export potential to Japan and the US, and are being careful not to over-exploit it. </p> <p>Russia and Norway have limited their catch this year to 37,500 king crabs each, but next year, as the numbers continue to balloon, it will be larger. The Japanese are already so keen on the new fishery that they are flying special teams over to buy up the pick of the catch. </p> <p>Runar Hartvigsen, regional director of fisheries and aquaculture for Finnmark, said: \"This is very good news for us. Research so far shows that the king crab has occupied a niche that no other species uses, and so there is plenty of food for them but no harm done. </p> <p>\"The only problem is that there are so many of them, and they weigh so much, they can break the nets of our other fishermen. </p> <p>\"There is no way we can control the crabs' advance or their numbers; what we have to do is make the most of the business opportunity they offer.\" </p> <p>He said that Japanese teams had already flown to Norway to investigate the fishery and planned to be there from October to January, buying the better flavoured male crabs and flying them back live to the Tokyo fish market. </p> <p>Fishermen currently get \u00a34 a kilogram (2.2lb) for the crabs at the quayside, but the retail price in Oslo is \u00a330 a kilo. The legs are so big they are broken off, cooked in their shells and sold in restaurants as \"crab sausages\". \"They taste superb, a mixture between prawn and lobster,\" he said. </p> <p>The Norwegians are now experimenting with farming the crabs, anticipating potential markets in the EU. </p> <p>Using medium-sized male king crabs about five years old, caught in fishing nets in March, the crab farmers are keeping them in enclosures on the sea bed and feeding them until the harvesting season begins in October. During that time the crabs will shed their outer shells and, in the two months before the new shell hardens, they will grow by 25% in size and weight. </p> <p>\"This means a four kilo crab in March is five kilos in the autumn, adding \u00a320 to its value and making farming a viable proposition,\" Mr Hartvigsen said. </p> <p>So far there appears to be no limit to the crabs' advance and scientists believe that they may reach as far south as Bergen in 10 years. By then Mr Hartvigsen believes, even the mighty king crab may slow down. </p> <p>\"The water south of Bergen is warmer. The king crab likes to be really cold, so it may stop advancing further south. But the fact is we do not really know until it gets there.\"</p>",

  "<p>Wap phones have gone from media darlings to techno-turkeys in the past few months as the backlash has set in. The system has now become the butt of jokes, like the suggestion that with both Wap phones and rap music, the c is silent. </p> <p>The hype machine has already moved on to the next generation: to the general packet radio service (GPRS) that is just starting to emerge, and the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), for which phone companies are spending billions on licences. </p> <p>Worse, Wap's struggle to find a market in Europe and the US is being contrasted with the exploding popularity of NTT DoCoMo's more advanced i-mode system in Japan. A VHS v Betamax-style formats war may be brewing. What went wrong? </p> <p>Karl Hicks, a mobile market analyst with Datamonitor, a UK-based research firm, says many of the problems have not been down to Wap at all, but the devices and networks used. The small screens on mobile phones, the difficulty of entering text, the slow connection speeds and \"the inability to get on the network, because of bandwidth restrictions, are not Wap's fault, but people associate them with Wap\", he says. </p> <p>But the truth is that the system was massively oversold. When Wap phones and real Wap services became widely available, the flakiness of the reality made the hype unsustainable. And while it is tempting to blame journalists for hyping a system that not all had used, the trade tends to point the finger at BT. </p> <p>When BT Cellnet's managing director, Peter Erskine, launched the UK's first mass market Wap service on April 3, he said: \"Today's announcement shows that BT Cellnet is determined to put the internet in everybody's pocket at an affordable price. We expect that within 18 months, sales of nearly all new mobile phones will be internet-enabled. It is expected by 2003 that more people could be accessing the web from mobile devices than from PCs. In effect, the mobile phone as we know it has had its day!\" </p> <p>If that wasn't bad enough, Erskine's audience was worse. Some seemed to think he had said that Cellnet was putting the web in everybody's pocket, and that it was the PC that had had its day. </p> <p>Obviously they were going to be disappointed when what they got was, in effect, a slow dumb terminal with a tiny monochrome screen that sometimes struggled to display a simple menu or a handful of text. </p> <p>No doubt this is very unfair to Phone.com, the company that invented Wap. Early last year, Macolm Bird, managing director of Phone.com's UK operation, told me: \"Wap isn't about phones surfing the web, it's about using services written for phones and sent to phones. It's possible to go to any web site and extract something that you could display on a mobile phone, but you get a much better service if you design the pages with the mobile in mind. So we do encourage people to write their applications in WML - wireless markup language.\" </p> <p>In other words, Wap was not designed to put \"the internet in your pocket\" but to provide something different. </p> <p>Of course, WML is roughly equivalent to HTML (hypertext markup language), the tagging system used to create web pages. It is also part of a whole raft of incompatible wireless standards that parallel internet standards. Others include WCMP (wireless control message protocol), WTP (wireless transaction protocol), WSP (wireless session protocol), and the scripting language, WMLScript. </p> <p>Sympathy for Phone.com's point of view is therefore mitigated by the fact that Wap has tried to piggy-back on the success of the internet. With hindsight, it might have been better to present it as a different system. </p> <p>For comparison, SMS (Short Message Service) has been hugely successful on mobile phones without anyone trying to pretend that \"texting\" is the same as electronic mail. Both formats are popular precisely because they do something different, and because both have useful applications. </p> <p>Phil Brown, managing director of Nokia UK, says: \"It's unfortunate that Wap has come to dominate the debate, because the consumer offering is not Wap. It's the service the customer is after, not the technology.\" He thinks that people want services that are personal, relevant and perhaps location specific, which could be anything from the football results to the address of the nearest Chinese restaurant. \"If you want to deliver that, then Wap is a very attractive way of doing it.\" </p> <p>The problem is that \"there's a serious lack of compelling Wap applications out there\", according to Tim Sheedy, a senior mobile market analyst with the International Data Corporation. He thinks many of the early adopters bought Wap phones for <a href=\"http://www.tegic.com/t9.html\">Tegic's clever T9 text input system</a>, \"and because they were just cool phones\", but mass market buyers are still waiting for applications. </p> <p>The web could fill the gap, but web content providers are holding back because it means rewriting their HTML sites in WML. As Hicks says, \"It needs a lot more momentum behind Wap before that really starts to happen.\" </p> <p>There are several excuses for holding back. For example, Wap might be overtaken by i-mode, which NTT DoCoMo is keen to export, or another system. Even if it is successful, Wap may have a very short life. Some argue that mobile devices are becoming more powerful every year, and that GPRS and UTMS will make it possible to deliver the whole internet to mobiles within two or three years. What's the point of investing in an incompatible cut-down web when you can have the real thing? </p> <p>I-mode looks good because it uses colour, and its cHTML (Compact HTML) language makes it easier to program, but it could have a tough time in Europe. Sheedy points out that it runs on a packet network, which does not exist in Europe. Also, while i-mode has \"thousands and thousands of applications, most of the content is written in Japanese, and most of the developers who understand cHTML are Japanese\", he says. </p> <p>Although Nokia is the only western company to make an i-mode phone, Brown is also dubious about its prospects here. He attributes much of the system's success to text messaging, because the Japanese didn't have SMS when i-mode was launched. Brown also argues that \"Wap is an evolving concept\" which will soon become more sophisticated. \"We're using Wap version 1.1 now but the discussion of Wap 1.2 is already about moving images,\" he says. \"Wap happens to use WML today, but there's nothing to say that can't alter in the future.\" </p> <p>But people like Robert Neuschul, technical director of Imagineering Technologies, an internet consultancy based in London, still don't see the point. \"We already have technologies in place - SMS, HTML, XML et cetera - so I'm at a loss to understand why we need another specification such as Wap or WML.\" </p> <p>And Neuschul already has what the phone companies are promising, although it's more a concept demonstration than a usable product. \"I've put a Cabletron RoamAbout wireless card in my Jornada handheld,\" he says, \"so I can talk to my sister in Vancouver while browsing for a vintner who could supply a specific vintage Pouilly-Fum\u00e9.\" </p> <p>The HP Jornada has a colour screen and provides a usable level of access to the web and to standard internet email services. </p> <p>It also has a microphone and headphone socket, so it can be used as a phone with free internet-based services such as Go2Call and Net2phone. And you don't ghave to pay international call rates. </p> <p>Although Hewlett-Packard's Jornadas run Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, anyone with a Palm or Psion can see how a plug-in GSM card could turn them into powerful mobile phones, and even Wap phones using <a href=\"http://www.ezos.com\">Ezos software</a>. </p> <p>The phone companies have already recognised the idea's appeal. Three of the biggest - Nokia, Ericsson, and Motorola - are working with Psion in the Symbian consortium to develop \"feature phones\" based on Psion's EPOC-32 operating system, and some already sell systems that use Microsoft software. Sony's powerful CMD-Z5 mobile phone, for example, uses Pocket Internet Explorer to handle both standard HTML pages and Wap content. </p> <p>So could telephony become just another aspect of palmtops that, like Microsoft PocketPC systems, already work as MP3 players, email terminals, electronic organisers, games consoles, maps, electronic books? </p> <p>IDC's Sheedy thinks not. \"I think we're going to see a massive fragmentation of devices: maybe someone will want their Walkman to be their mobile phone,\" he says. \"And if you're going out to a night club, do you really want to take your PocketPC?\" </p> <p>Although PDA makers are enjoying a boom in sales, Sheedy reckons their devices will always be bigger and more expensive than mobile phones with small screens and less memory. </p> <p>\"If you ask any handset manufacturer, none of them can say when they will no longer be selling that sort of phone,\" he says. \"There will always be an entry-level handset market.\" </p> <p>And if that's the case, maybe there will always be a need for something like Wap.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.altavista.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">AltaVista's</a> internet access promises might have been exposed as a sham last week, but the dream of unmetered access has not died - even if that company's credibility has. </p> <p>Indeed, despite reports to the contrary, there are still internet service providers (ISPs) offering unmetered internet access today, as our chart shows opposite. </p> <p>The quality of some of those offerings clearly leaves a lot to be desired, and still others (not listed) have provoked complaints to the advertising standards authority and trading standards. But flat rate charges for internet access should still become the norm for most internet users within months, rather than years. </p> <p>Two things will bring that about: new arrangements for standard dial-up internet access, along with the arrival of \"always-on\" broadband connections to the net. Both will change the way we pay for internet connections. </p> <p>Standard dial-up access has been hitting the headlines in the p'ast week, following AltaVista's about turn on its unmetered offer. </p> <p>AltaVista reneged on its promises because it realised, only after starting the hype machine, just how much unmetered access would cost.

ISPA's members are frustrated by the fact that BT's Friaco offer is only partially unmetered; the line from consumer to local exchange is unmetered, but the wires between local and regional exchanges are still metered. </p> <p>This, they say, is defying an order made to BT by Oftel last May, which told it to offer a wholesale unmetered tariff. </p> <p>Nicholas Lansman, secretary general of ISPA, says that while Friaco could be a \"very good thing,\" the ISP industry needs Oftel to be tougher with BT. \"Flat-rate pricing is very encouraging, and will be very good for e-commerce, education and so on,\" says Lansman. </p> <p>\"But unless the regulator helps the industry to get a fair product and get some competition, we're all going to be stuck in a mess. </p> <p>\"We're not being helped by Oftel unless they can be tougher, and make sure we have a fair, competitive environment for all ISPs. Ultimately individuals and businesses will be the ones which benefit.\" </p> <p>Lansman says AltaVista's embarrassment last week has been damaging to the internet industry in Britain, but adds that users generally get what they pay for. </p> <p>\"I think there is a load of people out there who are happy with their ISP, who gives them a good service at a fair price. </p> <p>\"When you try to get something for nothing, quality starts slipping. How can companies provide a service for free? The answer: they can't.\" </p> <p>Mark Jackson, editor of the website ISP Review - which helped unravel AltaVista's bogus service - echoes that view and says the arrival of unmetered access has \"turned an otherwise stable industry into a rat race. </p> <p>\"What we're seeing is hundreds of thousands of existing users moving away from systems not able to offer unmetered access. </p> <p>\"Now we have a new problem - the fact that unmetered ISPs simply can't cope with demand, and the costs of bringing unmetered access almost always outweigh the income.\" </p> <p>But Jackson does see the market settling down with the introduction of an acceptable version of Friaco and, next June, with the release from BT's grip of the final length of cable between exchange and customers' phones. </p> <p>\"The cheaper it is for ISPs to offer unmetered the better services will get, and the prices customers are forced to pay will be lower too,\" he says. </p> <p>But there is an other big event likely to change radically the ISP scene - the arrival of broadband internet access around the country. </p> <p>Broadband will come in a number of versions - via cable, telephone, satellite and eventually wireless technology. Cable companies NTL and Telewest have both announced plans to launch their services this autumn, and BT announced on Tuesday that - after several delays - it was finally launching its ADSL service to consumers that day. ISP <a href=\"http://www.Freeserve.co.uk\" target=\"_new\"> Freeserve</a> is also expected to launch an ADSL service on Monday, costing \u00a340 a month - a price which is expected to fall next year. </p> <p>The ADSL rollout will take some time - first to get the service will be 100,000 people on BT's waiting list. </p> <p>BT's need to convert exchanges one by one means, for now, only cities and large towns will be served by ADSL. But those users who do get the service will enjoy downloads at 10 times the speed of the fastest conventional modems. </p> <p>And, because ADSL is an \"always on\" connection, it will be unmetered as well. </p> <p>Ben Andradi, president of <a href=\"http://208.56.203.238/\" target=\"_new\">BTOpenworld</a>, said the launch marked \"the end of the talk about broadband Britain and the start of the reality - a new era for the internet.\" </p> <p>Maybe, for once, the hype might just match the reality. </p> <p><strong> Who should you pick?</strong><br> The best way to pick an ISP is to stay informed, says Mark Jackson of ISP Review. </p> <p>\"Remember that paying less rarely means you get more, so if you want a top notch service then you might have to expect to pay upwards of \u00a319.99 a month.\" </p> <p>But Jackson adds one note of caution - even the biggest ISPs can fall over, so the most cautious user might still find the ISP they pick is not perfect. </p> <p>Jackson recommends six ISPs, which all offer some form of free call or unmetered access. The ISPs listed below are different from the rest, he says, \"because they have proven themselves to be worthy of recommendation, at least for now\". </p> <p><strong> 24-7 Freecall </strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.24-7freecall.net\">www.24-7freecall.net</a> </p> <p><strong> World Online</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.worldonline.co.uk\">www.worldonline.co.uk</a> </p> <p> <strong> IC24</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.ic24.co.uk\">www.ic24.co.uk</a> </p> <p> <strong> Plus.NET</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.plus.net\">www.plus.net</a> </p> <p><strong> ClaraNET </strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.claranet.co.uk\">www.claranet.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> IG Click</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.igclick.net  \">www.igclick.net</a></p>",
  "<p><strong> How long have you been involved with the internet?</strong> I've been involved with it for about five years now. It's changed immensely in that time. When I first got involved in 95 I was with Leisure Product and we were the first leisure site to achieve over a million hits in a year. We thought that was great but now we talk about a million hits a day! So I think people's expectations have grown about 350-fold. </p> <p><strong> Are you happy with the way the net's progressing?</strong> If you're actually using it for email, and a lot of people do use it predominantly for email, it's doing a really good job. A lot of people are using it as a more flexible, more usable, fax machine and having a whale of a time with it. But people who use it for leisure tend to be looking for bigger downloads and faster, more reliable connections. </p> <p><strong> What is the role of the modern ISP?</strong> It's to provide a fast, reliable and always available service. Everything else is frills. To draw an analogy, it's like saying 'I'd love to go to the Caribbean but I haven't got any holiday left'. It's daydreaming. It doesn't matter how good everything else is, if you can't get on there in the first place then you'll never see it. </p> <p><strong> How do you feel about ISP's being more accountable for content?</strong> We've always made ourselves accountable for content. Because some of the markets that we serve are schools and families, we have always had SuperNanny as a mirror portal. So we've always been able to say to parents that if they keep the password safe then we'll keep the children safe. </p> <p><strong> Does the prosecution of Demon for content on their servers set a worrying precedent?</strong> We do everything that we can practically do to provide access, security and safety. Beyond that, there's actually very little we can do. There's no use shooting for something that's unattainable. The thing about the internet is that 100% safety 100% of the time and 100% control of 100% of events is never possible. </p> <p><strong> How do you feel about more regulation of the net?</strong> It is actually a very dangerous route to go down because it is all but impossible to impose a regulation. It's that old thing about the only bad laws are the laws you can't enforce! I fail to see how anybody is going to be able to properly and fully enforce regulation on the net. </p> <p><strong> Any favourite places on the net?</strong> You'll find me anywhere DSL technology is being talked about or tested. I book my hotels at <a href=\"http://www.hotel-assist.com\">www.hotel-assist.com</a> and my trains at <a href=\"http://www.trainline.co.uk\">www.trainline.co.uk</a>.

  "<p><strong> Wired for sound</strong><br> Now you can stay in touch and listen to music on the move without having to worry about where all the wires go. Clothes company Levi's has teamed up with Dutch electronics giant Philips to introduce the first of four new e-jackets. Each of the designs incorporates wires into the lining to create a complete body area network (BAN) for hooking up various electronic devices. </p> <p>The first truly wearable electronics available in the UK, these innovative jackets, which are the result of five years research in Philips' Redhill Laboratories, allow the synchronous control of the new Philips Xenium GSM mobile phone and Rush MP3 player via an integrated remote control. Microphone and headphones are stored in the collar and can be extended while playing music or making calls. When the phone rings sound from the MP3 player will automatically cut out. Available from September, the e-jackets will cost from \u00a3600 with MP3 player and Xenium phone fitted. (CP)</p> <p><strong> Printcam</strong><br> Everybody says \"I'll send you a print\" when they take a photo, but they almost never do. But Sony will help people keep their promises with the DCR-TRV820 camcorder, the first to feature a built-in printer. Press the shutter and the camera not only stores a VGA- resolution (640 by 480 pixels) image, it produces a small (6.4 by 4.8cm) print. The camera uses Sony's own Digital8 format and Memory Stick storage, and has a 25x zoom lens. </p> <p>In a flood of new products, Sony has also launched the DCR-TRV20, a megapixel digital video camera with built-in editing functions; the DCR-PC5, a palm-sized camcorder that weighs only 450g; the DVP-FX1 and DVP-F5 portable DVD players with 7in screens; the SCD-XB940 Super Audio CD player; two Art Couture TV sets, and a fast (8x) CD-RW writer, the CRX-160E-RP, to enhance your PC. It must be nearly Christmas... </p> <p> <strong> Touchy iFeely</strong><br> In September, Logitech is having another go at the \"feelymouse\" market with two rodents that react to what is on the screen. For example, a mouse should slide smoothly as the cursor crosses a plain white background, react when it bumps into a button, and vibrate on a \"rough\" image. </p> <p>Logitech launched this market a year ago with the Wingman Force Feedback Mouse, targeted at a games market where force-feedback joysticks and vibrating controllers are all the rage. </p> <p>The two new models use the same technology, licensed from Immersion Corporation, but follow Logitech's award-winning MouseMan Wheel design: unlike Wingman models, they do not use a large, dedicated base unit, and will work anywhere. </p> <p>The right-handed iFeel MouseMan will cost \u00a339.99 and the ambidextrous iFeel Mouse will cost \u00a349.99. </p> <p>Both mice are optical designs with flat bottoms and no balls. </p> <p><strong> Posh gear</strong><br> If you normally work on a large mahogany desk or boardroom table, neither the standard beige box nor a plastic-looking \"styled\" computer is going to look at home. </p> <p>AWTS, based in Somerset, hopes to soak up that market with the Vasari c rafted in wood. </p> <p>AWTS's Alan Jennings says it is \"designed to transcend the purely practical aspect of a computer and take it into the realms of desirability\". </p> <p>Technically, the machine is a rigid variant of a fold-up notebook PC, with a 650MHz Intel Pentium III SpeedStep processor, 64 megabytes of memory, and 14.1in colour LCD screen.
