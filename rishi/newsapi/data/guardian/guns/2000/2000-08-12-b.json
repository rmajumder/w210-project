  "<p>Do the Beckhams really have adjacent personalised toilets, Dennis Bergkamp a burning resemblance to the 'Boy with Seven-league Boots' in Ivo Caprino's animated fairytale, and Alfe Inge Haaland a passion for smoked mutton? According to companies leading the way in the booming online football diary business - we want to know - so much so that one of them, last week, offered David Beckham a \u00a31m advance for exclusive online access to his mind. </p> <p>In the last fortnight, hosts of existing UK diaries - Sportsnetglobal, Sportingidols and Icons (about to merge with the industry's aging Norwegian fore-runner, Sportprofile) - offered readers a varied diet. While David Ginola, Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit all used their diaries to announce multi-million pound transfers, young Alan Smith was penning a piece on his Leeds heritage, Erik Meijer revealed 'I have two bottles of alcohol in my room' and Lars Bohinen provided this insight into his leisure time: 'We've just had a well-deserved weekend off, during which I watched Formula One. It would appear to be quite popular to slam into Schumacher's rear end.' </p> <p>All of which is fine - as far as it goes. 'The content is undeniably banal', says Steve Nuttall, head of Sportal.com, who have so far decided against getting involved. 'The problem with the diary industry is there's very big money behind very little content.' </p> <p>Those backing the projects disagree. On one level, newsworthiness is readily manufactured. Sander Westerveld, Robbie Fowler and Alfe Inge Haaland have all provoked sensational press stories with indiscreet comments ('Damn this talk of fines!' wrote Haaland after his diary entry on the use of the words 'scum' and 'shit' in football provoked Leeds to take disciplinary action). But, inevitably, standard output tends more towards that of Patrick Berger, who spent 200 words of last week's entry discussing the weather. </p> <p>James Freedman, Chief Executive of Icons, says the future lies in aggregating what players have to offer. </p> <p>'Yes, footballers can be dull, and if we end up with pages of car wash anecdotes we won't succeed. But most players aren't like that. They are hugely enthusiastic about being able to take control of their image and talk directly, without the distortion or spin of the media. One hour after the Holland v Italy match in June, Frank de Boer was on the phone to us pouring his heart out. And Hassan Kachloul was here yesterday, telling us how he plans to write about Moroccan football, poverty and the Muslim faith. I'm not saying he's Melvyn Bragg, but it'll be interesting stuff.' </p> <p>Freedman hopes to have 60 players signed up by September, increasing the chances of a lively daily spread. Attention now is focussing on associated e-commerce schemes - where the fee mooted for Beckham's innermost thoughts begins to make sense. </p> <p>'The potential is enormous,' says Freedman. 'In terms on content, the diaries are really only chapter one of what we plan to offer. Commercially, this can be massive.' </p> <p>Japanese sites, rather longer established, have set up subscription diaries. Each of Hidetoshi Nakata's millions of followers pays $4.67 a month for access to his online diary ('It's a way for Nakata to show his gratitude to his fans,' suggests business manager Fujita Mina). But European fans, operators acknowledge, want to receive something more tangible for their money. Icons have begun auctioning shirts - Dennis Bergkamp's Euro 2000 top went for \u00a34000 - while Sportingidols, established by agent Jon Smith, has a com plex business plan. 'Players' existing sponsorship deals will take on a global dimension,' says Smith, 'opening up into, for instance, the lucrative Malaysian and Singaporean markets. Alongside this, we'll be merchandising, list-broking, content exporting, and looking at ISP and Wap provision - there's quite a lot planned.' </p> <p>But will the diaries be a strong enough foundation to keep the surfers coming? </p> <p>'That's the plan,' says Smith. 'The key principle of our site is that the players are the biggest shareholders. So in the simplest terms, the more interesting their diaries, the more they will earn. At the start it is likely to be tens of thousands - but in the longer term they could make huge sums.' </p> <p>Icons, Sportingidols and Sportsnetglobal - the big players - will go head to head later this year. The latter have begun taking on other top sportsmen - Brian Lara, Peter Scudamore and Johnny Herbert - to expand the genre, while sportingidols is relying on sheer weight of numbers: they hope to have 40 per cent of Premiership and Nationwide players in the bag by the end of the year. </p> <p>But is the world ready to peer into hundreds of footballers lives - including, mouth- wateringly, Alan Shearer's? </p> <p>'We're used to scepticism,' says Freedman. 'But we've got exclusive access and quality staff. Wait and see.' </p> <p><strong> David Ginola</strong> As for demanding his and hers Mercedes and a six-bedroom mansion, I can confirm that there is absolutely no truth in any of those ridiculous statements. All I did was to try and get a decent wage, again wildy exaggerated in the press, for having to leave Tottenham and uprooting to the Midlands. People have to appreciate that I did not anticipate any of this, having signed a three-year contract with Tottenham only 12 months ago.</p> <p> <strong> Patrick Colleter</strong> The web is a brand new way of communication. I find this technology interesting because it brings people closer together. Thanks to this medium, I am going to be able to share my feelings with you! To people here, English football is the best in the world. I find that amusing and surprising. </p> <p><strong> Robbie Fowler</strong> Considering my last update was only on Friday, it may seem strange that I have chosen to do another one so soon. That's because I have a good reason to. I couldn't believe the way some of the press on Saturday reproduced what I had written last time concerning Everton's signing of Paul Gascoigne ... If you want to know the truth, then you should believe what you read on my web page and not what you read elsewhere.</p> <p> <strong> Winston Bogarde</strong> The next step in my career is still undecided, but I suspect something might happen in the near future. My friends have told me this morning that my picture is on the back pages of some of the English newspapers. They are saying that I may be about to join Manchester United. That would be very nice. Marc Overmars announced his transfer on his website last week and I can promise all my fans that I'll do the same if the situation comes up.</p> <p> <strong> Pegguy Arphexad</strong> I have decided to open this personal and official website to keep in touch with all the people who are interested in my new adventure. I want to say to everybody, with a big smile: 'Hey, I am not dead yet!'</p> <p> <strong> Lars Bohinen </strong> The first A-team friendly has taken place. We played against Crusaders in a testimonial in Belfast. We managed 0-0, which is a good result when you go off to Europe to play.</p> <p> <strong> Veggard Heggem</strong> By visiting my website you will be supporting a good cause! I will donate part of my earnings to the Children's Clinic in the Trondheim Hospital and to the Marie Curie Centre here in Liverpool.</p> <p><strong> Thomas Myhre</strong> As far as card games are concerned, Trond Andersen and I toyed with, and at times humiliated, Kjetil Rekdal and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. After a couple of 'off days' with an unbelievably unjust distribution of good cards, we're now back in the driving seat. During these two days of 'poor hands', I began to wonder whether I hadn't dishonoured the daughter of the man who invented playing cards. </p> <p><strong> Dennis Bergkamp</strong> There's still a lot of talk about Marc and Manu's departures from Highbury. I think Arsenal fans should now just move on really and start to look ahead. These things happen ... It's not like someone has died or anything. </p> <p><strong> Marc Overmars</strong> Finally, the waiting is over. Today I will fly to Barcelona for a medical and to sign a five-year contract with Barcelona. My agent concluded the deal a few hours ago, which involves a \u00a325 million transfer fee. I'm so excited. But I obviously have mixed feelings. I'm also sad because I will be leaving so many wonderful guys at Highbury. Some of my former Arsenal team-mates don't even know about the move as I write this. I will give you more details later on today, for now, I need a rest.</p>",
  "<p>Longer office hours may leave workers more tired than ever before, but there is one perk beyond bonuses and promotions - more staff are expecting sex in the workplace. </p> <p>Psychologists and therapists believe workers with little time to meet people outside the office are turning to their colleagues for sexual gratification. Basic physical transactions, often devoid of romance, have become part of the everyday power-play for many British workers. </p> <p>Analysis of the tendency has produced four types of sexual opportunist: the office predator, the power junkie, the office innocent and the power-seeking missile. The motives of each are as much about gaining status among colleagues as about sexual satisfaction. </p> <p>Psychotherapist Phillip Hodson, who contributes to a television programme about sex in the office to be shown on Thursday, sees the breakdown of a distinction between the personal and the professional as a consequence of a cultural emphasis on work. </p> <p>'There has been a blurring of lines,' he said. 'But it is not surprising. Work is usually a power-based hierarchy and sexual foreplay is really about the excitement of having one's expectations either thwarted or fulfilled. It is therefore always about power to some degree.' </p> <p>The Channel 5 programme, called Sex on the Job , will reveal that work-related fantasies are now commonplace. Many young employees come to work expecting sexual contact in much the same way as they might expect a bonus for performing well. </p> <p>The monthly business magazine The Director has also recognised an increase in sexual activity at work. In the current issue managers report that they are frequently worried by rumours of flings between employees because they fear a resultant sexual harassment claim. </p> <p>Researchers for Sex on the Job found that workers in other countries had a very different attitude and were shocked by the sexually orientated nature of work in the UK. 'One Italian man we spoke to said he could not believe it,' said producer Peter Kessler. 'The \"Latin type\" actually has a life that is not structured around the office, because on the Continent things are not so work-focused. Over here, we have squashed all our behaviour into one place.' </p> <p>Kessler found that young executives had developed a 'thrill-seeking mentality' and that certain types kept recurring. 'The predator' is described as the kind of person who sees sex as part of the week's objectives. Success is a boost akin to an increase in earning power. </p> <p>'The innocent' is the person who excites colleagues by appearing to be entirely uninterested in sex or flirting. It becomes a challenge to 'corrupt' or 'conquer' them. </p> <p>'The power junkie' is someone who is hooked on sudden and uncomplicated sex with colleagues and enjoys influencing their behaviour. </p> <p>The 'power-seeking missile' is the kind of employee, usually a junior, who needs to dominate bosses sexually in order to feel more secure. </p> <p>Hodson believes anyone who works in an office will be familiar with at least one of these types. 'People play with structures and break taboos and it is obviously exhilarating for them,' he said. </p> <p>'Men often talk about an office nymphomaniac, but this is the wrong term. That is a rare condition and only applies to someone who is mentally sick. What you do sometimes find in the office, however, are women with a promiscuous attitude who are often insecure in their position. They are needy people who may only feel in control when they can arouse the lust of a man.' </p> <p>Hodson believes the more exhibitionistic employee will also be encouraged by the fact that they have a built-in audience. 'You know you will always be observed, no matter how discreet you pretend to be,' he said.</p>",
  "<p>If your attitude to money is that of spendthrift, your are more likely to get into difficulty than if you are a miser. Changing your ways won't be easy. Brendan Fehily, national counselling manager with the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, says that about 20 per cent of clients drop out of debt recovery programmes within six months. 'But people who are committed after six months stay for quite a long period.' </p> <p>Those who complete a programme usually discover that they have extra money at the end of each month. 'We advise them to open an account and put money to one side.' </p> <p>The main reason that clients have got into difficulty is that they do not budget and often do not know exactly what their income is, let alone their spending. Income is no guide to whether someone will get into difficulty. Fehily recently dealt with a middle-aged couple who had \u00a3110,000 of debt, in addition to a mortgage of more than \u00a3100,000. The husband had taken early retirement but they still had a joint income of \u00a33,500 a month after tax. They had had to cut back on eating out, leisure activities and there was no more 'doting on the grandchildren'. </p> <p>Mary (not her real name) is in her late twenties and works in marketing earning \u00a332,000 a year. Despite this, she has been forced to reorganise her finances, consolidating a variety of debts into a \u00a310,000 loan. 'I make one debt payment of \u00a3200 toward the loan. American Express are the only ones who would give me a credit rating. It's my only credit card, which is always cleared at the end of the month by direct debit and is only used for convenience,' she says.'I know exactly what is in my account now. Half my income goes towards rent and loan repayment. A quarter goes straight to my credit card and I know that is the amount of convenience spending I have for that month. The remaining quarter divided into four is the amount of cash I can have each week. It works out at about \u00a310 a day and it'll be like that for the next four years. </p> <p>'My attitude has changed. If I get a bonus at the end of this year it will all go into reducing my loan.' </p> <p>People facing a crisis with debt obviously need to radically change their habits. </p> <p>For many, though, Paul Webley, professor of economic psychology at the Exeter University, says small changes over a long period are more likely to make a difference than a crash money diet. 'For example, you could set up a standing order to make sure there is money going out to pay for bills and car repairs.' </p> <p>Often the solution will be 'low-tech' - only taking a certain amount in your wallet when you go shopping, say. </p> <p><strong>Hitting the jackpot - without the dream going sour</strong></p> <p>Who wants to be a millionaire? </p> <p>Stories about sudden riches that make it into the news tend to concentrate on obscene excess, or post-affluent destitution. But a large number of people cope well with sudden windfalls - be it the lottery, pools, Premium Bonds, or an unexpected inheritance. By 11 July this year the National Lottery had created 1,006 millionaires. Elaine Thompson scooped \u00a32.7 million on the lottery in 1995. She gave a third to her brother. She and her husband Derek now run a luxury holiday accommodation business based around a former farm outside Lyme Regis. Their initial reaction was one of shock. 'We were scared the neighbours would get jealous, or the children would have a hard time at school,' said Elaine. 'We're very much in favour of state schools, so long as they provide a well-balanced environment. We didn't want to have to pull the children out and send them to a private school.'</p> <p>The couple lived in Basingstoke and for the first two years they carried on working in their existing jobs - Elaine worked part-time doing the payroll for a local garage and Derek, an accountant, worked for Motorola. They started looking for a business after 18 months. 'We wanted something that we could do together and would feel comfortable with.' Elaine believes her solid relationship with her husband, stable family life and the advice they accepted from Camelot all contributed to their successful acclimatisation to sudden wealth. 'We considered ourselves extremely lucky before the money came along. And we've always discussed everything together.'</p> <p>Elaine also believes the money has given her confidence. She now handles interviews and chat shows with aplomb. The couple have two children, aged 10 and 15, and the couple's aim is to see them settled in careers before they think of doing anything more adventurous with their money. 'I'm more interested in SATs and GCSEs than world cruises,' says Elaine.</p> <p>Both children have trust funds and will have access to some money when they reach 18 and then again at 21.</p> <p>'I spoil them at Christmas and birthdays, but I always have,' she added. 'I was from a single parent family, my father left when I was five, so I don't want them to have nannies and be away from me. They're not going to be children for ever.' </p> <p><strong>Who to call</strong></p> <p>National Debtline: 0645 500511 <br> Money Advice Association: 020 7489 7707<br> Consumer Credit Counselling Service: 0800 138 1111<br> The Bankruptcy Association: 01524 64305<br> Citizens' advice bureaux: local phone book</p> <p><strong>And where to go for help if the miser is in control:</strong></p> <p>IFA Promotion: 0117 971 1177<br> Financial Services Authority: 020 7676 1000<br> Society of Financial Advisers: 020 8989 8464</p>",
  "<p>Take two nations, the Italians and the Brits. Which would you say is more inclined to save and finds it easier to control their spending - the flamboyant Mediterranean race or the more phlegmatic northerners? If you incline towards a prudent UK, you'd be wrong. </p> <p>At last month's 25th Annual Colloquium of the International Association for Research into Economic Psychology in Vienna, a paper from Paul Webley of the University of Exeter flagged up national differences in attitudes to financial planning. </p> <p>Italians were more inclined to save and found it easier to control their spending than the Brits surveyed. But across the sample, higher income led to more saving. And whether one felt flush or cash-strapped compared to one's reference group was also a way of predicting behaviour. </p> <p>The conference, held jointly with the Society for the Advancement in Behavioural Economics, also heard papers on such diverse subjects as children's savings behaviour and how women select perfume brands. </p> <p>Even our relationship with our clothes isn't as simple as it looks. Portuguese research on the the expression of self in clothing consumption found that clothes are an intimate part of our lives and a way of expressing ourselves - with the brands we choose playing an important part. </p> <p>Consumer expenditure has been rising by a greater margin than income since 1996, according to Mintel's annual British Lifestyles report. </p> <p>Research questioning 1,958 adults about spending plans found top spending priorities were having a good holiday (46 per cent), followed by buying a new car (38 per cent), decorating /making minor home improvements (38 per cent) and buying something for the home (37 per cent). </p> <p>In the past 10 years, gross income has increased by 22 per cent in real terms. The average personal taxable income is now more than \u00a330,000 per household - a 12 per cent increase from 1989. </p> <p>The amount of consumer credit outstanding is \u00a3600 billion, equivalent to more than \u00a310,000 for every adult in the country. </p> <p>Home acquisition and household services remain the largest element of the expenditure mix, at 30 per cent of spend in 1999. Travel and finance are the next largest expenditure areas, accounting for 17 per cent each. These two areas have shown the most growth over the past decade, with entertainment a close third. </p> <p>Some 53 per cent of adults - 59 per cent of men and 48 per cent of women - view owning a car as important to their lifestyle. Some 38 per cent would buy a new car as a priority given long-term financial confidence. </p> <p>Clothing expenditure has shown the greatest growth in the personal goods sector, increasing by 54 per cent in real terms between 1989 and 1999 to just under \u00a328bn. This is true of men as well as women. </p> <p>Expenditure on male toiletries has risen by 79 per cent in the past 10 years, as younger male consumers want to smell good as well as look good. </p> <p>Just under \u00a360bn is spent on pensions, equivalent to \u00a32,150 per employed person, or 9 per cent of average earnings. Four out of 10 adults regard both life insurance and personal pensions as important.</p> <p><strong>What kind of money manager are you? </strong></p> <p><strong>Sensible-but-sad </strong></p> <p>As a child you shopped around for savings accounts, rejecting fluffy toys in favour of top interest. You started a pension in your early twenties and school fees planning as soon as you stopped using contraception. You aim to retire at 50 and know exactly how you'll finance it.</p> <p>Congratulations, you're a model of prudence. But you've probably also had a predictable, unbroken employment record. Would you cope if circumstances changed? You may also be missing out on experience today for the sake of safety tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>Modern-day miser </strong></p> <p>You won't identify with the Dickension miser, but the tendencies are there in the way you search through best-buy tables and check your Visa statement to see what exchange rate you paid on that cheap wine in Calais. Your habits may protect you from want, but could also be a source of family conflict.</p> <p><strong>Defiantly ignorant </strong></p> <p>You take pride in taking as little interest as possible in money. Worrying about the future is a waste of time and keeping track of your bank balance is for neurotics. You run a balance on your credit cards and never pay them off even though you think banks are a rip-off and part of the global capitalist conspiracy. There is nothing damaging about this approach in itself, but you will come unstuck if your income dries up. Your inability to face up to financial issues may also be difficult for partners to cope with.</p> <p><strong>Chaotic but comfortable </strong></p> <p>You earn enough to afford most everyday needs, and holidays, but sometimes lurch into the red. You looked for a cheaper mortgage once, but never got any further. You know you should have a budget, but it would be too tedious to work out what you spend on takeaways. You've no idea whether you are putting enough into your pension.</p> <p>You're in good company: much of the British population operates this way. The risk is that you'd find it difficult to cope if circumstances changed, and you'll get a shock when, at 50, you find it is too late to save for retirement at 55. The good news is that if you spend a few hours looking at what you spend, why and where, you're close to a balanced attitude.</p> <p><strong>Compulsive </strong></p> <p>You habitually spend on things you don't need. You don't always wear the clothes you buy. 'Shopaholics' are often dismissed as fashion victims, but their habits can be a symptom of psychological distress. If your spending is getting you into debt, seek help. If you can cope financially, think seriously about why you behave this way.</p> <p><strong>Delusions of grandeur </strong></p> <p>You have wealthy friends, and hate not keeping up. You want your house pristine, and why not? You can borrow on the equity in your house. But you could be in the grip of a delusion that has felled at least one internet start-up and many a financial fraudster: you have access to money, but you can't afford to splash it around because it is not really yours.</p> <p><strong>Thrill-seeker </strong></p> <p>You are interested in money - but only in making it quickly without robbing a bank. The internet provides the means by which financial thrill-seekers can indulge themselves in the stock market. But you may not amass riches long term. For thrills, try white-water rafting.</p> <p><strong>Too cautious by half </strong></p> <p>The thrill-seeker's alter ego, you may be shocked to realise that pensions and endowments are stock market investments. You're a natural saver and have more in the bank or building society than you'd ever need in an emergency. You're just too nervous for anything adventurous. But if you're saving for large expenses - putting children through university or paying for retirement - you need a less cautious approach.</p> <p><strong>Keep it simple</strong></p> <p>People on low incomes are probably more likely to be good money managers than the well off, according to Paul Webley, professor of economic psychology at Exeter University. </p> <p>Many people don't manage their money very well, but they don't need to. For others, things are so finely balanced that letting the children go swimming will throw them out. 'If you spend whenever you want to but have a steadily rising income, it is not a problem. A rising level of affluence means people can afford to be lax.'</p> <p>For more affluent people, counting pennies may be unnecessary, but setting aside money for a pension is a priority. Webley says that even here you do not necessarily need a huge level of financial planning. Once the direct debit is set up, you won't notice it.</p> <p>Webley's definition of a healthy modern-day attitude to money is to have a long-term view. You should consider, for example, how you will finance children through university.</p> <p>Having a wide and diverse collection of investments and insurance products does not necessarily mean you are a good money manager. Most advisers are familiar with clients who have a rag-bag of investments, often of poor value,and have no idea why they bought them. Other clients may have invested over-confidently, buying and selling too often and spending too much on charges. And some people fall prey to the exhortations of insurance companies to protect against every conceivable risk - from theft of garden gnomes to unnecessary credit protection.</p> <p>Advisers say that investors who do well have generally chosen a few, simple products with reasonable charges and good long-term records, and made few changes to their portfolios.</p>",
  "<p>Hard work and brains don't automatically make you rich. A high-rolling lifestyle won't automatically make you destitute. </p> <p>But your psychological profile can have a profound influence on your ability to handle and 'control' money. It defines the risks you are prepared to take and sorts the misers from the spendthrifts. It may help determine your job and how far you make it up the corporate ladder; and therefore how much money you earn. </p> <p>A number of factors can play their part - our childhood and background, even choice of partner. For example, a dominant individual who is financially adept (or appears financially adept) can sometimes inhibit the capabilities of his or her partner. </p> <p>Reckless parents may produce parsimonious children. A sudden windfall may allow us to indulge ourselves - and others - or bring the more distrustful side of our nature to the fore. </p> <p>All of us exert mental control over money to achieve a balance of spending and saving. These controls should also allow us to take more or less risk with our cash given a specific set of circumstances. </p> <p>One person may be unable to maximise their savings because they are so worried about the impact that even low levels of risk may have on their capital. A spendthrift on the other hand may be a risk junky. Neither is particularly healthy. </p> <p>But considering how important money is most of us still think in simple terms - have we got, or have we not got, enough money? </p> <p>Few of us evaluate exactly how we use what we have and whether we have achieved the right balance between the miser and spendthrift that lurks within us all. </p> <p>If our finances are stable and sufficient this may not pose a problem. But if something happens to upset the balance; a misfortune - such as divorce or redundancy - or even good luck, such as a pools or lottery win, our ability to cope may come into question. A major problem is few of us ask for financial help, or we ask for it too late. </p> <p>Talking about money in any detail could be one of the last great taboos. In her book The Real Meaning of Money , psychologist Dorothy Rowe points out that while sex may have come out of the cupboard since Victorian times, we share that generation's prudery when it comes to discussing cash. Victorians forbade any discussion of money within the home. We may ask a friend about their divorce but not their salary. </p> <p>'One of the reasons we are secretive about our own money is that we want to present ourselves to the world as being very sensible and rational about money, but in fact we are not,' said Dr Rowe. </p> <p>The irony is that while most of us will happily sit down and have frank and healthy discussions about the birds and bees with our children, we may find it harder to get to grips with the pounds and the pence. We are more likely to discuss the overdraft and the missed mortgage payments when the children are tucked up in bed. </p> <p> <strong> Spend, spend, spend</strong> </p> <p> Credit and electronic commerce have freed us from the physical constraints once imposed on our money. This may unchain the spendthrift within us. Once you were only as rich as the cash in your pocket. Now we speak in terms of income multiples - I have this, so I can borrow that! And there is a growing range of goods and services for us to consume - from widescreen TVs to exotic holidays. </p> <p>The consumer durable, meanwhile, is being replaced by something more transient; CDs are superseded by MP3s, VHS by DVDs. Household DIY has little to do with maintenance and a great deal to do with fashion and image. Fitted carpets are pass\u00e9; laminate floors the latest thing. You have to spend to keep up and the spendthrift will seize on this as a justification. </p> <p>And all of this consumerism is on very obvious display. No longer are the lives of the 'other half' glimpsed through the keyhole. If anything, older-style affluence with its windy country piles and strict protocols is losing its fascination. You can be rich and make up the rules as you go along. </p> <p>'Despite the theory that we are still a very class-based society there is increasing social mobility,' said social psychologist Professor Michael Argyle. 'The only area that it is very difficult to break into is the very top stratum.' Instead our ability to rise in society depends on a combination of 'achievement, motivation, ability and luck'. </p> <p> <strong> Hoard, hoard, hoard</strong> </p> <p> But not all of us are cut out to be financial wizards - at least, not without help. Debt agencies increasingly have to deal with the fall-out from the new financial order. John McQueen, founder of the Bankruptcy Association, talks about the financial 'naivety' of some people, particularly young people starting their own businesses. </p> <p>'I can think of two young men who got together to run a pub. They were bankrupt in six months, yet they were able to raise the money to get the business off the ground. And the Government is encouraging more people to have a go by promoting the idea of an entrepreneurial society. Not everybody is up to the mark.' </p> <p>Most of the people McQueen sees have started a business, but general insolvency figures show a sharp rise in consumer bankrupts. </p> <p>This new generation of bankrupts may well be rearing children who will err on the side of caution in their financial lives. Bankruptcy and redundancy cut deep into the psyche. Factors such as pensions mis-selling, hyped endowments and stock market crashes add to our doubts and fears about handling cash and may awaken the miser in us. </p> <p>Even the Government exhorting us to take increasing responsibility for our financial welfare and not rely on the state can spook the financially less confident. If we are poor in retirement - for example - it will be our fault and not the state's . Scary stuff. </p> <p>Then consider that money is becoming ever more ephemeral. It is as powerful as it ever was but we see it less and less. Our wages are paid directly into a bank account. We pay for things with credit and debit cards. </p> <p>As we lose physical contact with money our psychological attitude to it becomes even more important. This may well encourage the spendthrift, but the miser's money stuffed under the mattress could turn out to be a perfectly understandable - if extreme - alternative reaction to the cashless society. </p> <p><strong>A bit of Posh - but keeping up with the Beckhams costs you dear </strong></p> <p>What makes some people good with credit cards while others loathe them? Jan Pahl, Professor of Social Policy at the University of Kent and author of a Invisible Money: Family Finance in the Electronic Economy, says human behaviour is complex and how we manage money is determined by a combination of different factors - rarely one alone. The main factors are: </p> <p>\u0095 Rational choice. We make choices that are best for us financially using available information. With the right information we can take charge of our financial well-being.</p> <p>\u0095 Social groups. Different groups have varying access to money. Unemployed people and low-income households, for example, are often excluded from getting credit.</p> <p>\u0095 Psychology. We all carry emotional baggage that affects the way we use money, even what we want from a financial institution. For example, some of us may need a bank that is tough on overdrafts - others may resent it.</p> <p>\u0095 Culture. People give meaning to money above and beyond its basic economic value. It can affect what we buy and the way we buy it. Gold credit cards, for instance,allow people to display their income status.</p> <p>According to Pahl, while education and information about personal finances are presented in terms of rational choice, most people are not rational consumers. 'Beneath all the rationality there is a strong vein of emotion surrounding money, in the form of anxiety, anger, fear, guilt, embarrassment and so on.' These emotions, along with status, age and gender, have to be taken into account when encouraging consumers to make the best decisions.</p> <p>'Keeping up with the Joneses' is a key factor behind financial debt. The worst place to be is in the bottom economic layer of your perceived financial strata, as you spend more to keep up.</p> <p>This is a particular problem for young professionals fresh out of college. If you are a new solicitor in a small practice earning \u00a315,000, for example, you may feel pressure to spend to keep up with colleagues who are earning \u00a325,000. After all, noone wants to be in a position of not being able to stand their round at the pub.</p> <p>We all occasionally spend money to boost our self-image, but in its extreme form people become addicted to shopping - with dire financial consequences. Crowds that throng shopping malls at weekends are not there because of any desperate need. We shop for fun and relaxation. Money is not exclusively tied to the practicalities of life. Even the less well-off use money this way.</p> <p>Psychologists and mail order catalogues have long recognised that the least well-off are prepared to out-spend many better-off families at key events such as Christmas and birthdays.</p> <p>Credit allows us to spend money we haven't got and our relative affluence - or poverty - increasingly comes down to self-control. We now have more to aspire to than ever before.The wealth enjoyed by others, such as Victoria and David Beckham, is displayed for all to see on television and in glossy magazines. Advertising, which uses aspirational lifestyle images, also plays a critical role.</p>",
  "<p> When the Spanish dictator Franco died 25 years ago, Juan Goytisolo felt liberated. \"I discovered that my real, tyrannical father was Franco,\" he says, \"my mother was killed by his bombs, my family destroyed, and he forced me to become an exile. Everything I created was a result of the civil war.\" </p> <p> Yet for the child of the 1936-39 Spanish civil war, whose books were banned under the victorious Franco regime, liberation came too late. He was living with a Frenchwoman and moving between Paris and his adopted land of Morocco. \"It would have been impossible to have a third life in Spain. I love Spanish culture but hate Spanish society; I can't live there.\" </p> <p> For 45 years, the expatriate Goytisolo has been both widely acknowledged as Spain's greatest living writer and its most scabrous critic. In some 30 books of fiction, autobiography, essays and journalism, he has turned the Spanish language against what he derides as \"Sunnyspain\", flaying the \"Hispanos\" while excavating their culture's Moorish and Jewish roots, suppressed over the centuries. He is passionate about Islamic culture (he speaks Maghrebi Arabic as well as Castilian, Catalan, French, English and Turkish) and castigates European insularity from a vantage point across the Gibraltar straits, siding with pariahs and heretics the world over who have been driven out and glory in a treasonous revenge. </p> <p> His friend, the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes, likens Goytisolo to the Irishmen Swift and Joyce: \"exiles condemned to live with the language of their oppressions, digest it, expel it, trample on it, and then resign themselves . . . \" For another admirer, the Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, Goytisolo's books are \"unsettling, apocalyptic . . . a strange mixture of pitiless autobiography, the debunking of mythologies and conformist fetishes, passionate exploration of the periphery of the west - in particular the Arab world - and audacious linguistic experiment\". </p> <p> His translator Peter Bush, director of the University of East Anglia's centre for translation studies, believes no other Spanish writer matches his \"intellectual reach, constant invention of language and unusual absorption of other cultures - or stands on a par with the best of the Latin American writers, like M\u00e1rquez and Julio Cort\u00e1zar. Although he writes novels in an avant-garde, provocative, modernist style, there's always a political urgency behind them. His keen sense of history comes from his own life.\" </p> <p> Goytisolo lives in Marrakech, in a beautiful old house in the medina. Now aged 69, a small, rather frail figure, he is an habitue of the Caf\u00e9 de France on the main square of Djemaa el Fna, the pulsing heart of the Moroccan city. Though growing hard of hearing, he revels in its constant drum beats and human murmur which echo in his courtyard, shaded by orange trees. </p> <p> He is known as austere but has a surprising warmth and an impish humour, punning \"Rimbaud\" and \"Rambo\", or laughing at his own incompetence with gadgetry. Young children - the sons of brothers who have worked for him for almost 20 years, play delightedly with a tortoise at his feet. </p> <p> His new book, The Garden Of Secrets, is published next week in English. Hailed by Fuentes as \"one of the very finest novels in Spain of the last 10 years\", it returns to the civil war era that haunts much of Goytisolo's fiction. In 28 tales - one for each letter in the Arabic alphabet - it probes the fate of a fictional friend of Lorca, the great Spanish poet and homosexual, held by the fascists in a north African jail as \"a red, a queer and a poet\". The author's lifelong skewering of Catholic, nationalist Spain has been bound up with his bisexuality and an avowed quest for political, moral and sexual freedom. </p> <p> His masterpiece two-volume autobiography in the mid-1980s, Forbidden Territory and Realm Of Strife, broke ground in Spanish letters with its introspective sexual and emotional honesty. It traces his life up to the mid-1960s, when he ceased to be merely \"a writer of my generation\" producing conventional, neo-realist novels, and struck out on a path of risk and experimentation. </p> <p> The gay US writer Edmund White says: \"Goytisolo made sacrifices for both his literature and his politics. In a culture that now is evolved and permissive, but was then full of macho uptightness, his autobiography brought a note of total frankness. Homosexuality challenges the exploitation of women and role playing, the silences of personal life.\" </p> <p> Guillermo Cabrera Infante, the Cuban novelist, sees his friend as a \"picador: a frank and solitary writer on a crusade for truth. He's pugnaciously honest about his personal life, which is not easy in Spain. He doesn't kow-tow or buy the official line - Franco or post-Franco - and he doesn't belong to any Spanish coterie or club. He's an outsider - his own man.\" </p> <p> Perhaps for that reason, Goytisolo has won none of the country's big literary prizes, and has never been a member of its Royal Academy. He can still shock with a novel such as Carajicomedia (A Cock-eyed Comedy), now in its fifth edition since publication five months ago in Spain; it's a Swiftian satire on the Catholic church and its powerful secret society, Opus Dei. </p> <p> Through his journalism, too, he keeps up an abrasive dialogue with post-Franco Spain. In 1998 he was declared persona non grata by the mayor of the south-eastern boom town of El Ejido for denouncing the conditions of African migrant workers, and is proud to be an \"honorary Gypsy\" for his defence of another embattled community - \"still classified as immigrants after five-and-a-half centuries\". A collection of his roving reports for the Madrid newspaper El Pa\u00eds is due out in translation this autumn. </p> <p> Goytisolo was born in Barcelona in 1931, the third of four children, of \"exemplary bourgeois stock\". His Basque-descended father was an executive in a chemical company, and suffered from pleurisy. The family spent the civil war years in a mountain village in Catalonia, but when Juan was seven his Catalan mother, Julia Gay, was killed in a Francoist air raid during a visit to Barcelona. His father, who hated communists, remained loyal to Franco and was imprisoned by Republicans, the family \"caught in the crossfire of both sides\". </p> <p>After the war, Goytisolo was a \"mixture of orphan and street urchin\". His father forbade his late wife's parents from speaking to them in Catalan. Goytisolo, who writes in Castilian, the official language of Spain, says: \"I only learned Catalan in France in the 60s. But I was always on the periphery of Castilian; I have the freedom of someone not in the centre.\" </p> <p>There were literary antecedents on his mother's side, and his elder brother Jos\u00e9 Agust\u00edn, who died last year, became a poet; his younger brother Luis, a novelist. When Goytisolo was about eight, he was sexually molested - \"fondled, not raped\" - by his maternal grandfather. Yet more than the trauma, what emerges from his autobiography is compassion for the repressed homosexual grandfather who had been forced out of jobs and was mercilessly humiliated by Juan's virulently homophobic father, who made the penurious old man and his wife move out, though they all dined together every day. </p> <p> \"I'm against pederasty, obviously,\" says Goytisolo. \"I was a child and it was not agreeable to me; my grandfather wasn't responsible for my later sexual life. But in my 20s I assisted in his petty persecution, and it was very cruel. In the end, I felt pity for him.\" </p> <p> His grandmother became senile. \"My mother was killed; her sister and mother died in psychiatric asylums. Recently my brother discovered some beautiful poems my aunt wrote in her 20s. But my family never talked about her. Women were also the victims of this family.\" </p> <p> Goytisolo's belief that Catholic morality spawned his grandparents' \"secret tragedy\" spurred his drive to flee the \"castrating rather than sterile\" values of the Barcelona middle classes His agnosticism, Marxist leanings and sexual ambivalence put him at odds with his father, who was, however, spared the pain of his son's \"coming out\" by his death in 1964. \"I was contrary to all his expectations; he was very Catholic, a monarchist,\" Goytisolo says. \"But I saw a beggar here in Marrakech who had the face of my father when he died, and I was very moved.\" </p> <p> He was schooled by \"ignorant, small-minded Jesuit priests\", so calls himself an autodidact. He studied law in Madrid and Barcelona, and in 1954 published his first novel, The Young Assassins, to acclaim. Repelled by anything Spanish until he was in exile, he read European and American literature. But he soon fled a milieu where he felt alien and hamstrung by self-censorship. He moved to Paris in 1956 and, as a reader for the publishers Gallimard, became a conduit for writers of the Latin American \"boom\", including Fuentes, Cabrera Infante and Manuel Puig. </p> <p> His wife-to-be, Monique Lange, was a secretary for a translation agency who later became a novelist. Lange, who died in 1996, had a four-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, Carole (whose godfather was William Faulkner). The couple began a lifelong \"open\" relationship - each accepting the other's affairs - reminiscent of their friends Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. </p> <p> \"The first time I was in love was with Monique Lange,\" says Goytisolo. \"She was a fantastic woman, open, generous; she understood everything.\" Goytisolo who once described himself as a \"typical progressive intellectual and Communist party fellow-traveller\", wrote fiction influenced by Sartre's theory of social commitment, while filing bitterly anti-Franco reports for French newspapers. He threw himself behind the 1959 Cuban revolution, partly out of guilt at the discovery that his Basque great grandfather had made his fortune from slaves in Cuba. </p> <p> \"As a child I saw many photographs of his sugar plantation, but I was very shocked by the letters from his slaves. It was the beginning of the revolution, and I visited the village where many of the black and mulatto people had my family name. I even met a Juan Goytisolo.\" He last visited Cuba in 1967. \"I discovered the repression against African religions, censorship and persecution of homosexuals; I felt estranged from the revolution after that.\" </p> <p> Cabrera Infante, who met Goytisolo in Paris and travelled with him to Cuba, recalls him as \"very shy and serious - though later I discovered his extraordinary sense of humour and irony\". He tells how Goytisolo was asked to appear on Cuban TV - on condition that he made no mention of his friend, by then on Castro's hate list - but he talked endlessly about Cabrera Infante's novel Three Trapped Tigers. \"He kept his word ,but did what he wanted to do; he has a dispassionate sense of fairness.\" </p> <p> Goytisolo finally broke with the Spanish Communists after predicting that Franco's dictatorship would collapse not through their efforts but through the modernisation of Spain. \"By the mid-60s, 2m Spaniards were emigrating, and 15m tourists came with their customs and freedom: society was changing. I was right, but it was sacrilege. I found myself banished by Francoists in Spain and attacked by the Communist party in exile. I decided not to write about Spanish politics till after Franco's death.\" </p> <p> He knew many writers in Paris, from Camus (\"cold and distant\") to Hemingway, whom he met at a bullfight. But Jean Genet was his mentor - \"moral more than literary\". He says of the playwright who could fit all his belongings in a suitcase: \"He was alien to all kinds of vanity. Because of him, I discovered I was interested in literature, not in literary life. I try to take my work seriously but not myself.\" He quotes Genet: \"If you know your point of arrival, it's not a literary adventure, it's a bus journey.\" </p> <p> Genet may also have been a catalyst for his exploration of bisexuality. Edmund White, Genet's biographer, says: \"Genet was absolutely fearless. When they first met, Genet stared at Goytisolo and said, 'You're a fag, aren't you?'. He represented absolute freedom from middle-class morality and total integrity in art.\" Goytisolo, who loathed \"traditional female passivity\", had been drawn to the bars and brothels of the Barcelona slums of his early fiction, but hankered for dockers. \"My sexuality was never bourgeois or polite,\" he wrote. \"I was never attracted by well brought-up people wearing ties.\" He saw himself as a masked imposter and yearned for authenticity. </p> <p> \"In Barcelona my only sexual education was to go with [women] prostitutes and men of my class,\" he says. \"But it was not satisfactory. In Spain the model of men I find attractive didn't exist then. But in France I found friends in the Arab coffee houses of Barb\u00e8s, where I remember being the only European. I tried to learn Arabic.\" </p> <p> He found his type in the \"rough, sunburned sons\" of the Islamic belt, from Morocco to Pakistan. He and Lange were active supporters of the Algerian independence movement, the FLN, and protested against crackdowns on north Africans in Paris during the Algerian war of 1954-62. In White's view: \"like Genet and Pasolini, Goytisolo is a gay European drawn to the Third World through his erotic tastes but who ... developed that impulse both through political activism and artistic innovation ... [He] is an apostle of the revolutionary, anarchic power of sexuality, of the desiring body, to break through the sterile confines of class.\" </p> <p> In the Islamic world, Goytisolo maintains, \"homosexuality is very natural but it's a condition not to be named\", and is often signalled not by effeminacy but by exaggerated virility. \"I never go to bed with men of Christian origin,\" he adds. \"It's almost impossible, because they've come to an open homosexuality out of a long sickness. I was sick for years, and didn't want to meet people who were also sick.\" </p> <p> He prefers illiterate or less educated men. \"I had homosexual writer friends, but there's a need to be with someone completely different: social difference plays the same role in attraction for me as gender between men and women.\" On the dangers of exploitation, he says: \"There's always a commercial transaction; there's no love, but there's friendship. I love only Monique; I never fell in love with anyone else.\" </p> <p> Lange, who introduced Goytisolo to Genet and found his enigmatic sexuality alluring, is described by White as having been \"totally warm, charming and very French, but painfully shy and with a slightly beaten look\". Goytisolo's first fulfilling gay sex, with an Arab man in Barb\u00e8s, prompted an agonising four-year crisis. It was resolved in 1965 by a moving letter he wrote to Lange (included in his autobiography), in which he confessed to being \"totally, definitively, irrevocably homosexual\". Her response came in a telegram: \"An inhuman week. I still love you.\" </p> <p> From that time Goytisolo lived part of the year in Morocco, often without Lange, and their focus shifted, he wrote, from sex - though they still had a physical relationship - to \"shared values and feelings\". \"That letter to Monique was the most difficult act of my life,\" he recalls. \"I was afraid her reaction would be to cut our ties. But we kept together in a beautiful relationship. She knew there was no possible rivalry between the men I went with and her. I think she was sad, but she took a strong moral position: it was a kind of victory, to establish a new relationship against social prejudice. It was very difficult. But human beings are more complicated than they're supposed to be by society. We tried to live without lies. Most people I know live permanently in lies; many couples exist because they've both hidden many things.\" </p> <p> Lange's novel Les Poissons-chats tells of the heroine's difficult love for a homosexual, and Lange referred to her own husband as \"ever absent\". However, from his point of view, \"it was always with humour and generosity\". </p> <p> In 1978, Lange had a health scare, and they decided to get married. For Goytisolo, the dawn of sexual openness at 34 was a \"rebirth\". \"I felt a free man; suddenly free of ideology, religion, patriotism.\" He broke with realism in the autobiographical Marks Of Identity (1966), which he calls his \"first adult novel\". He disowns his previous eight books. From then, all his works were banned in Spain till Franco's death, but were published in Mexico or Argentina. </p> <p>They have been translated into French, English, German and, increasingly, Arabic; his following extends to Morocco, Syria, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon. Marks Of Identity, together with Count Julian (1970) and Juan The Landless (1975), formed a trilogy that shocked with its celebration of 700 years of Moorish Spain and hybrid culture. Count Julian was once described as a \"poison pen letter to Spanish society\", because it sent up the Catholic cult of virginity. It also attacks Spain's obsession with \"purity\", which includes denying the Arabic influence on the Spanish language. The book was conceived in Tangier and reveals the subconscious Spanish terror of the Moor. Goytisolo says: \"for centuries Spain was a frontier between the Christian and Islamic worlds; anti-Muslim sentiments are very profound. When I was a child, people would say, 'Be quiet, the Moro is coming',. I felt completely foreign to my country. I imagined the destruction of Spanish mythology, its Catholicism and nationalism, in a literary attack on traditional Spain. I identified myself with the great traitor who opened the door to Arab invasion. I discovered that the Franco dictatorship was the result of a long tradition that began in the middle ages.\" </p> <p> For Goytisolo, the first modern totalitarian state came with the Catholic monarchy's support for the Inquisition and the later expulsion of Spanish Muslims in 1609. Spain's destruction of its plural culture was the downfall of that state, bringing with it intellectual sterility and delayed modernity - its \"long holiday from history\". </p> <p> He says: \"The vitality of a culture is in its capacity to assimilate foreign influences. The culture that's defensive and closed condemns itself to decadence.\" Goytisolo in exile has re-read the Spanish classics he once spurned. \"I've spent almost all my adult life outside Spain. I compensate by trying to live inside Spanish culture. Everything I wrote after Count Julian was a dialogue with Spanish literature. I know many writers who want disciples, imitators. But I'm looking for ancestors.\" </p> <p> His eclectic family tree includes the Archpriest of Hita, a 12th-century \"Boccaccio or Chaucer\" who mixed Latin, Hebrew, Arabic and Castilian; the mystic St John of the Cross; the Sufi poets; and the picaresque novelists. For him, the Spanish canon has been \"brutally savaged\" by persistent taboos, such as refusing to admit that Cervantes might have been a \"new Christian\" - a Jewish convert during the Inquisition. \"If you don't take into account the Jewish origins of most writers of the 15th to 17th centuries, you don't understand the drama: it was the first confrontation of intellectuals against a totalitarian state. It's like teaching 20th-century Russian literature as a Golden Age, without mentioning the Gulag.\" </p> <p> Nor is the Arabic role acknowledged in the origins of the European novel - he cites Cervantes, who was held captive in Algiers, drawing on the Thousand and One Nights: \"Kundera was right to say the modern novel began with Cervantes. Don Quixote combined the western and Arabic traditions.\" </p> <p> Goytisolo calls The Garden Of Secrets a homage to Cervantes. He learned that many civil war poets were gay - Lorca and friends on the Republican side, and closet homosexuals among the Falangists, Franco's fascists, who \"wrote very bad poetry about the German army and the Aryan ideal\". Yet while Franco's side was virulently anti-semitic, its Moorish mercenaries from the Rif were attacked by the other side, the Republicans. </p> <p> \"They weren't able to distinguish between the Moroccan people and poor mercenaries who need to eat. I'm not nostalgic or idealistic; there was always conflict between Jews, Arabs and Christians in Andalucia. But the problem is, they said you can't be Spanish without being Catholic. Always, those who don't speak like you are 'foreigners' who need to be expelled.\" </p> <p> When Goytisolo much later returned to Almeria province in southern Spain, where the poverty had shocked him in the 1950s, he found an agricultural miracle fuelled by north African migrants. He likened their conditions to those of Cuban slaves, prompting him to predict today's renewed cries of \"Moors out!\". He despairs of post-Franco Spain - as newly rich, newly free and newly European. \"After the treatment of immigrants and Gypsies, I feel the same way about Spain as I did in Tangier. The problem is the incapacity to embrace the richness it contains.\" The same goes for \"Fortress Europe\". Seeing Turkish graffiti in Le Sentier, the Paris garment district where he lived with Lange, Goytisolo's impulse was to take up Turkish classes. </p> <p> \"When I was a child in the 40s, the Catalan language was forbidden. I realised that to have two languages and cultures is better than one; three better than two. You should always add, not subtract. I've tried to be a kind of European with a knowledge of other areas of the world.\" He revels in the polyphony, diversity, healthful promiscuity and \"reciprocal contagion\" of cityscapes, which he celebrated in his novels Makbara (1980) - a hymn to sex as freedom - and the darkly funny Landscapes After The Battle (1982). For him, an \"urban animal\", the \"Babelisation of great capitals\" is a sign of modernity. </p> <p> In The Virtues Of The Solitary Bird (1988), the terror of Aids merges with a wider fear of contamination - to \"not being of pure blood, pure Christian; being infected by a foreign or alien ideology\". He sees Spain's expulsions of Jews and Muslims as a precursor of today's ethnic cleansing, by the likes of Radovan Karadzic in Bosnia and Jean-Marie Le Pen in France. During the Bosnian war, he wrote of the targeting of Sarajevo's library by ultra-nationalist Serbs, who echoed the Spanish fascists of the 1940s, as \"memoricide: thousands of Ottoman, Persian, Arabic manuscripts were destroyed to kill memories and construct a new mythology\". </p> <p> In a lecture in Oxford, entitled \"We are all Bosnians\", he called for intervention. Where, he asked, were the Hemingways and Orwells to defend secular citizenship - \"the most important part of the French revolution? I was convinced that after the second world war and the Holocaust some things were impossible in Europe. But I discovered in Yugoslavia that my conviction was wrong; everything is possible.\" </p> <p> Since his wife's death four years ago, Goytisolo has lived in Marrakech. \"She died suddenly in her sleep. For her it was wonderful, there was no pain. But I wasn't prepared. It was very difficult for me to get used to living in Paris without her; I got depressed. My apartment became a kind of tomb.\" </p> <p> He has created an unorthodox household with his friends the Darouzi brothers (\"not a sexual relationship; it's family\"), and their sons, eight-year-old Rida, and his younger cousins, Younes and Khalid - who he has made his heirs. </p> <p> He also heads a Unesco drive to have Marrakech's Djemaa el Fna, where he learned his colloquial Arabic, designated as the world's first \"oral heritage\" site. Scornful of the \"educated but uncultured\" Moroccan bourgeoisie who look down on the low-life spinning fabulous tales on the square, he gleams with uncondescending pleasure at the paradox: \"The illiterate storytellers were my professors.\" </p> <p> The Garden Of Secrets is published on Thursday by Serpent's Tail, at \u00a314.99. Juan Goytisolo will be at the Edinburgh book festival on Saturday August 26 at 3.30pm.</p>",
  "Travel advisers last night warned women travelling alone to be wary even with fellow backpackers. <p>Elaine Robertson, co-author of the Backpacker's Bible, described a form of backpackers' etiquette called \"adoption\", in which lone women travellers are approached by other backpackers. </p> <p>\"If women are seen smoking alone, emailing constantly or writing postcards at dinner, other backpackers will befriend them and invite them to join their groups,\" she said. </p> <p>\"Women should be wary of being lulled into a false sense of security. The rule is to trust your instincts. Do not go with a group if you do not feel safe.\" </p> <p>According to one independent travel firm, the Gap Year Company, 200,000 backpackers under 26 leave Britain each year. Around 40,000 of them are school leavers and the rest mostly graduates taking a break before starting jobs. </p> <p>The Lonely Planet publishers estimate that 30% of travellers leaving Britain each year are lone women. Britain produces more women travellers than the United States, accounting for more than 16m trips abroad a year, according to the World Tourism Organisation. </p> <p>Most women backpackers who travel alone do so believing they will meet like-minded people on the trail. They assume there is safety in numbers - even strangers - as long as they are part of the backpacking crowd. </p> <p>Ms Robertson said the most popular destinations among 18- to 23-year-old backpackers were Australia and Asia. Travellers to Thailand and Vietnam pay\u00a32 a night for a mat in a dormitory. But she said backpackers were becoming bored by well-known routes and were seeking kicks in Cambodia, \"for the thrill of dodging landmines and the Khmer Rouge\", and Iran, \"for the buzz of entering through dangerous parts of Pakistan\". </p> <p>Lone women were most likely to risk straying from the beaten path. Research published last week by the Gap Year Company found that young women travellers were more adventurous than men. </p> <p>According to Tom Griffiths, the company's director, Africa is generally the least popular backpacking destination in the world, though not with lone women. Ethiopia, Libya and Somalia, along with Nicaragua and El Salvador, are becoming key destinations for women travellers. </p> <p>The research comes during one of the worst summers for backpacker deaths. In June, a fire at a hostel in Childers, Australia, killed 15 travellers; last month backpackers Paul Winder, 29, and Tom Hart Dyke, 24, disappeared between Panama and Colombia; and Lucie Blackman, 21, disappeared in Tokyo, where she was working as a hostess in a bar. </p> <p>One 19-year-old, who travelled through Central America this summer, said she and some friends gave their home addresses to a Mexican they believed was running a holiday competition. He phoned their parents in England, told them they were in trouble over drugs and demanded that money be wired to him. </p> <p>Sian Rees from the Suzy Lamplugh trust, which advises on safety for women, said women who travelled on their own should not be discouraged by isolated incidents. </p> <p>She said: \"There are simple rules to follow. Check the Foreign Office website, research the destination, set up a free email address at Hotmail or Yahoo! and stay in contact with others. Women should not let their guard down because they are on holiday. They should take credit cards and a phone card charged to a home account for emergencies.\" </p> <p>The Lonely Planet guidebooks advise travellers not to tell other backpackers where they are staying and not to give out their room number. Women should check the locks on rooms before accepting them.</p>",
  "Her room has been left untouched since they found her. A few clothes are strewn over the floor. There are empty boxes of camera film, some Pantene shampoo and the stub of a candle. <p>Before her brutal murder in the early hours of Thursday morning, Kirsty Jones had been living just as thousands of other young backpackers in Thailand do - roughly, cheaply, messily - and with little regard to what the future might bring. </p> <p>She arrived at the Aree guesthouse in the hill resort of Chiang Mai, 400 miles north of Bangkok, on August 4. With its billiard table, bar and flourishing pot plants - and the portrait of Thailand's king and queen hung reverentially in front of the downstairs bedrooms - the guesthouse must have seemed a congenial place to hang out. </p> <p>The owner offered Thai massage lessons in an upstairs room via a rickety staircase. Rooms were cheap - \u00a31 a night for a single - though small and rather grubby. The Aree fails to make it into the Lonely Planet guide to Thailand. But it boasts a small but pleasant courtyard where you can eat under the stars, enjoy the evening breeze and try to ignore the kittens mewing at your feet. </p> <p>For Kirsty, who had already spent three months in Thailand en route to Australia, it was as good a place as any to relax. Kirsty got chatting to another British backpacker, Nathan Foley. They hit it off. She, like him, was travelling on her own. \"She was just bubbly. She was happy and cheeful and loved to talk,\" he said yesterday. \"She was having a great time.\" </p> <p>Another British traveller, Sarah Wiggett, also formed part of the group. The three would eat in the evenings at a local bakery, and then pop in for a pint at an Irish bar nearby. </p> <p>Two days after arriving at the guesthouse, Kirsty set off again for a three-day trek in the hills which surround Chiang Mai, and are a favourite tourist destination. She took photographs of elephants. Another shot captures her slogging through lush jungle. The photos were recovered from her rucksack. There are also earlier pictures of her posing on the beach in southern Thailand in a bikini and larking around in a wetsuit. Put together, they form an eloquent chronicle of her final days. </p> <p>Within hours of her return to Chiang Mai, Kirsty was dead. There are few facts. On Wednesday evening, she, Nathan and Sarah had dinner together in a Thai restaurant. According to Nathan, he then returned to the guesthouse to try to phone his girlfriend in Spain. Kirsty and Sarah wandered around Chiang Mai's night bazaar, a line of illuminated open air stalls selling ethnic clothing and jewellery not far from the ancient city's crumbling walls and moats. </p> <p>At 11.30pm Sarah went back to her guesthouse. It is not clear when Kirsty returned to the Aree - or whether she was alone. At 1am on Thursday morning screams could be heard coming from her room. \"I heard 'Get out, get out, get out, leave me alone, leave me alone',\" another British backpacker, Stephen Trigg, 27, said. </p> <p>He and the Aree's Thai manager walked towards where Kirsty was staying in room number four. By the time they arrived the screaming had stopped. And mysteriously, the door was padlocked from the outside. They concluded - wrongly - that Kirsty had been involved in boyfriend trouble. They went back to sleep. </p> <p>In fact she had been raped and murdered. The killer had used Kirsty's deep blue sarong to strangle her. He had left her lying face down on the bed, arms outstretched, and had fled into the night. He had padlocked the door on his way out. The 23-year-old Liverpool University graduate would not be found until 4.30pm on Thursday, more than 12 hours later. </p> <p>By this stage her friends had become worried. \"I had a gut feeling something was wrong. It wasn't like her to disappear like that,\" Mr Foley said yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Foley went voluntarily to the police and was questioned yesterday. Police said last night that he was free to leave, but he chose to stay under their protection. </p> <p>Kirsty's body was discovered by one of the Thai maids at the guesthouse. There were few signs of a struggle. The Thai police arrived shortly afterwards and took her body to a hospital for forensic examination. The British embassy in Bangkok was alerted and frantic attempts were made to contact Kirsty's parents, Sue and Glyn, on holiday in Spain. Her brother Gareth heard about her death on the radio. </p> <p>Throughout most of yesterday, a procession of dazed backpackers was led into a police office where lawyers translated their witness statements into Thai. The investigation is likely to continue for several days. </p> <p>As dusk fell on Chiang Mai last night, other western travellers expressed horror and bemusement at Kirsty's savage murder. \"I'm surprised it happened here because people in Thailand are very polite and friendly,\" Dutch backpacker Wouter Daal said, speaking from one of the city's many internet cafes. Another traveller, German Christoph Meyr, pointed out that a German tourist was shot dead in Chiang Mai two weeks ago. His Thai killer has now been caught. </p> <p>\"I'm worried. This is the second incident that has happened recently. Normally Chiang Mai is a very quiet place. You can walk up and down and no one bothers you.\" </p> <p>Back at the Aree guesthouse several backpackers who were there on the night of Kirsty's murder were eating supper. \"It's very hard to concentrate now. I can't enjoy my Thai massage course any more. We can't relax,\" one said. </p> <p>What did he think had really happened? \"People buy illegal substances and can't control themselves any more. There are a lot of drugs here. You can get everything, including heroin. Whoever did this must be really crazy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rubber-necking. It's difficult to resist when the footpath takes you past a millionaire's des res. Fort George on Guernsey is where the tax exiles hide away. The hideous houses, with their high walls and hedges to deter the likes of me and you, are one of the highlights of the island's coastal walk. But where are all the idle rich? No sign, no movement from behind the curtains, so best press on. There's a lot of coast to see.</p> <p>Guernsey is Jersey's quieter sister. It's smaller, less crowded and not quite so keen on showing off. In a long weekend, you can comfortably see all the island. A slow drive round the coastal roads takes a couple of hours, but the best way to experience the island is on foot or two wheels.</p> <p>The coastal walk begins in Havelet Bay, south of St Peter Port, and follows first the west coast then the south around to Pleinmont tower. Guernsey tilts like a badly-made wedding cake, and the south coast is the thick end of the slice with steep cliffs and secluded bays. The full walk is a challenging 17 miles, but the coast-road bus route is never too far away - those who find it impossible to pass the many beaches or caf\u00e9s without stopping can always cut back and flag down a bus.</p> <p>Beginning with Fermain, each bay appears more beautiful than the last. At Le Jaonnet, the footpath is the only route to the tiny beach, and Petit Bot is stunning. Half-way round at Le Gouffre, the Hollows cliff-top restaurant has an open terrace with a view of the bay and an inviting menu.</p> <p>Originally, the Channel Islands were in the fiefdom of William of Normandy, and some islanders point out that this makes mainland Britain their colony - rather than the other way around. Relationships with France have always been a little fraught, and half-hearted attempts to retake the islands pepper the history books, although the only tangible evidence of a violent past are the reinforced concrete ruins left by the most recent invaders. German forces landed 60 years ago, on June 30 1940. There was no resistance. Many people had already been evacuated to the mainland, and the remaining islanders were made only too aware by London how futile it would be to resist.</p> <p>The result was a very civilised war. Violent incidents were few and, after the D-Day landings, the islanders and the occupying force starved together as food supplies were cut off. </p> <p>In the intervening five years, the Germans must have spent the entire time constructing bunkers. Most are ruins, but at Fort Hommet a gun emplacement has been restored to give an impression of the damp, cramped conditions that the gunners had to put up with. Better than the Russian front though. St Peter Port is worth a wander, with cobbled streets and even several shops that do not sell perfume, jewellery or woollens. Restaurants are many and quality is high - as are the prices in some. </p> <p>On a hill leading out of the town is the house where Victor Hugo, author of Les Mis\u00e9rables and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, spent his exile from France during the reign of Napoleon III. The house is a testament to his vast ego. His motto \"I Hugo\" is everywhere. Each morning, he used to take a shower on the roof. Presumably his neighbours were very understanding.</p> <p>The nearest of the other Channel Islands is Herm, just over 20 minutes away. If you take the early ferry, you can walk around the whole island, which can be done in a couple of hours, have a huge lunch at the White House restaurant, then a snooze on the beautiful Shell beach until it's time to catch the ferry back to St Peter Port. It is an itinerary well worth following; if I'd had the time, I would have done it all over again the following day.</p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong></p> <p><strong>How to get there</strong><br> <strong> By air: </strong> British European Airways (0990 676676), formerly Jersey European, flies Southampton-Guernsey from \u00a389 return including airport taxes; Gatwick-Guernsey return costs from \u00a399; Birmingham- Guernsey return from \u00a3130.

  "<p>Port Meadow is so close to Oxford, yet such a contrast to it: a huge expanse of flat, open grassland, full of grazing animals and wild geese, within a stone's throw of the bustling centre of the university town with its cramped pattern of medieval streets.</p> <p>This makes for a quick escape, and Professor Susan Greenfield takes the opportunity whenever she can. \"It's so easy and so nice and you don't need a car,\" she says. \"In just two minutes, you can be somewhere that hasn't ever been under the plough - it's always been common land.</p> <p>\"There's no element of suburbia to go through - quite suddenly, you're there. And what's particularly charming is the animals and the grazing, which is how the grass is kept down, because they don't allow anything mechanical on it. It hasn't changed since medieval times.</p> <p>\"Whenever I go there, I come back feeling re-charged. There's no sign of the 21st century, no pylons, no mechanical instruments of any kind, absolutely nothing. It's just a lovely, gloriously open space, and you feel a sense of serenity and pleasant isolation.\"</p> <p>Greenfield, who heads Oxford University's department of pharmacology and is a director of the Royal Institution in London, has just completed a book and a TV series on the human brain, on which she is an internationally-recognised expert.</p> <p>But if she has a free Saturday to relax, she's likely to choose a full circuit of Port Meadow, first heading north for a three-mile walk along the Thames to Godstow, then crossing the river and coming back down the other side of the meadow along the Oxford Canal.</p> <p>The first leg starts among rare black poplars, tall and unstable and the subject of a poem by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Then she emerges from the shade to take in the view: \"The beauty of it is there's so little between you and the city - there's you, then the river, then just grass and the houses and spires looming up behind.\"</p> <p>You can detour to the hamlet of Binsey for a drink in the Perch, or continue past the manicured Godstow Lock and the remains of a convent to reach the Trout, next to a thundering weir. This is where, as an undergraduate, Greenfield had her first drink, choosing lager in preference to Babycham and feeling suddenly grown-up.</p> <p>From here, you cross the railway for the return leg down the canal. It's closer to houses and people, and reminds Greenfield of Victorian times and the part of Thomas Hardy's novel Jude the Obscure where the hero is dying in his miserable lodgings - \"it's the slightly gloomy, industrial part of Oxford - the underbelly\".</p> <p>She prefers walking by herself or with one other person - with more people, she says, it becomes \"a dinner party on foot - someone's walking faster or slower than someone else, or you can't all squeeze down a path together, and the whole thing's a mess.</p> <p>\"When you do the kind of thing I do, talking or staring all the time at computers in places with artificial light and air conditioning and so on, it's very good to get back out again among things that are totally natural. I find it an escape, a balm to the soul.</p> <p>\"I'm much more of a sponge when I'm walking, a passive recipient - I switch off, and the positive effect comes later. I feel in control of my life again. I feel on top of things and get a sense of proportion. And of course with strong physical exercise you get the release of endorphins, which give you a sense of well-being.</p> <p>\"The only thing I don't like is walking when it's hot. Spring and autumn are best, and I don't mind getting wet as long as it's not a real soaking. Rain is quite nice because it's quiet, and the smell of the wet vegetation is lovely.\"</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Frequent trains and coaches to Oxford from most parts of Britain.

  "<p><strong> Why? </strong> Because it's lovely, beautiful and flat. You can even see the back of your own head. In fact it's so flat that if your dog runs away you can watch him go for three days. I guess that if you've left your heart there it's easy to find - unless a prarie dog grabs it and put it in a furrow. I've never actually lost my heart there in a romantic sense, and I've lived there for nine years. What I love about it is that it's very scenic - even the most mundane task takes on a spectacular meaning. Going to the cleaners, for example - if you have a greasy spot on your jacket and want to walk to the dry cleaners, you'll have the most majestic backdrop. There's Sergio Leone directing it and music playing in the background.

  "<p>Reggae during the lunch interval hasn't worked. Nor has letting the Windies win one nor helping Brian Lara get back into form. No question, the powers-that-be have to do much, much more to encourage Afro-Caribbean crowds back into the specially designated sections of our Test grounds. </p> <p>For it to continue in a healthy state, this great game (cricket) needs their wonderfully positive outlook on life, and in particular their 36 quids. But how many West Indian streakers have we seen this summer? About the same number as Nass Hussain has scored runs, actually.</p> <p>It's been suggested that because of a more laid-back lifestyle they tend not to plan their streaking in advance like the English lads do, going on a strict lager and pie-and-chips diet for weeks beforehand so as to be fit for the cameras. Perhaps we could set aside a limited number of Windies streakers' tickets to be sold on the day.</p> <p>On the vexed subject of summary punishment for streakers, I don't know if anyone heard the fascinating discussion among the Test Match Special experts during the Old Trafford Test? Pod did, and there's nothing I would have liked more than to join in the free-ranging debate. Sadly I was stuck in the Dartford tunnel and my Nokia decided that was the moment not to send any e-mails.</p> <p>But suggestions ranged from putting streakers in a cage and humiliating them (that came from CMJ, who'd clearly been giving it a lot of thought during the interruptions), to fining them \u00a310,000, confiscating their clothes and sending them home harry starkers on the tram. All appealing in their different ways. An idea that some of the tabloid boys have come up with would get the Podmore vote. That is to publish the names and photos of known streakers and encourage county members to take the law into their own hands.</p> <p>The Naming and Shaming and Torching and (optional) Castrating initiative might also offer up some alternative ideas as to what to put in those delightful hanging baskets outside the Old Trafford pavilion.</p> <p>The other great talking point this week has been the dearth of world-class England spinners. Who will they pick for the Oval? Well, stop the presses, hold the back page, the sports pull-out and Ceefax page 352 - Dave Podmore has taken up the twirler's art. Obviously there's a shortage of offies now and, to be honest, I'm sick and tired of banging it in hour after hour on these flat pitches, and for what? Sometimes I get that knackered out there I have to bowl with a runner.</p> <p>Whereas if you're a spinner in this country you've only got to land it on the cut part and suddenly everyone's got their arms in the air shouting \"Oooh, we like that!\" into the stump mike.</p> <p>And now Crofty's out of the equation, Schofield's been sent away to develop for a decade or two, and Hicky can't even get a bowl at Worcester despite being captain. So it's down to a tiny handful of us to do the business at the Oval, which we are reliably informed is the mummy and daddy of all bunsens these days.</p> <p>Let's look at the candidates. There's a couple of lads at Northants who don't look anywhere near ready to me; then there's Ian Salisbury, provided the ECB can afford the counselling fees - and Tuffers obviously, but let's try and keep this discussion serious, shall we? Phil Edmonds is too busy running the Belgian government, or whatever it is he does these days, and Embers has had enough of everything, frankly.</p> <p>So it's move over Murali and sod off Saqlain because Pod's got his long spikes on and he's scratching up the pitch like a cat who's just had a crap. You haven't seen the back of Dave Podmore yet - unless you were overtaking our team coach on the way back from Kidderminster last week, and happened to look up at the right moment. So castrate me.</p>",
  "<b>Dear John,</b> <br>  The British Parliament and Courts until recently, have always been able to restrict the rights of the individual in the interests of the wider society.   So our laws have allowed public demonstrations to be stopped if the police thought they might lead to violence; those charged with murder, manslaughter or rape could not be given bail if they had been convicted of those offences previously; prison authorities were allowed to read prisoners mail if it was thought that the letters might disclose the whereabouts of the proceeds of crime; young boys were protected from the attentions of older men by a higher age of consent for homosexual acts; and a home secretary, answerable to the House of Commons, could decide how long the worst juvenile offenders should be kept away from society.   We do not have to look into the crystal ball to see whether the Human Rights Act incorporating the European Convention of Human Rights will mean that the rights of the individual will be upheld at the expense of society - we can read the book! For all the above laws - and many others - have been overruled by the European Court or by a compliant Parliament.   After 2nd October the rights of the individual will take precedence over society more often   Yours sincerely <br> Sir Ivan Lawrence QC <br> <br> <p><b>Dear Ivan</b><br><br> The problems with your examples are: 1) that public demonstrations would also be stopped when there was no threat, disorder or violence; 2) innocent people would be remanded in custody; 3) prison authorities could prevent communications merely because they were critical of them; 4) the protection of young people was used to justify homophobia, 5) and Home Secretaries kept people in prison not because they were dangerous but because they were concerned about the reaction of the tabloid press. <br><br> The essence of the philosophy of human rights is that there are standards which should never be breached even by a democratically elected government. For instance the Human Rights Act will mean that governments and parliaments should never be able to authorise torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment no matter what the circumstances, and no matter how popular with the electorate such conduct was. Elected parliaments in this country and around the world have shown that, on their own, they are not able to protect human rights properly. This is partly because most of them, including our own, are dominated by the government. <br><br> In any mature democracy minorities and human rights are best protected by the checks and balances in the constitution. Until the Human Rights Act came into force there were too few safeguards and the executive in Parliament was too strong and the courts have been too weak to protect rights. Democracy is important, but elections are never going to be about the detailed rights of this or that group and unfortunately the rights of minorities or those suspected of crime are never going to be popular enough to make a difference. <br><br> Yours sincerely<br> John Wadham Director, Liberty. <br><br> <b>Dear John,</b> <br><br> Since you do not deny that the individual will take precedence over society more often, I take it that you are conceding the point. <br><br> Whilst I deny the problems you allege with my examples will arise, I do agree that democracy alone does not necessarily provide protection for the individual. Indeed the strength of our own system is that democracy, together with an independent judiciary and the rule of law, does provide that safeguard. <br><br> When Britain helped to draft, and then were amongst the first to ratify the European Convention in 1951, it was to prevent a repeat of the Holocaust in the new Europe, not to allow European judges to over-rule our British Parliament or judges in much less significant matters which ought to remain within the province of a democratic nation state. Under this legislation it will be European, not British, judges who in the end may decide that we cannot return Sikh terrorists to their own country or that a car owner should not have to say who was driving when it set off a speed camera. <br><br> What most interested people, I suspect, might ask is - why should not our own judges be the ones who decide, if they consider it appropriate to do so, that in these matters the interests of the individual foreign visitor, or car owner, can be overridden in the interests of society generally? <br><br> Yours, <br> Ivan Lawrence<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Ivan</b><br><br></p> <p>There are difficult issues to resolve between the individual's rights and that of society but the key question is who decides what society needs. The Human Rights Act will mean that, when police officers, bureaucrats or even Parliament is making those decisions on our behalf, they have to be more careful. The power exercised by the state and its agents will have to be a proportionate response - no sledgehammers to crack nuts. <br><br> I must say I find it surprising for you to criticise the Convention on the basis of the nationality of the judges. Many of them are renowned experts on human rights and one of the virtues of the system is that it allows others with a fresh approach to consider our law and practices. <br><br> After all, if our system of justice is so good we should be able to persuade the rest of the world of this. Also, other countries with very similar legal traditions like Canada and New Zealand have very similar Bills of Rights and their judges are making similar decisions to those in Europe. International human rights now has very consistent thinking on many areas and it is about time our judges were exposed to this and could contribute to it. <br><br> Every time I ask people in this country to sit down and draft the kinds of rights that they want for themselves, their families and their friends, they produce a list very like the rights in the Convention - the right to life, privacy, a fair trial etc. Every other mature democracy has such a system to protect it against the government, the police and other public agencies and I am surprised that, as a good Tory living under a Labour Government which has a large majority you don't want this too. <br><br> Yours<br>John Wadham<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear John,</b> <br><br> I believe that all our national institutions - police, bureaucracy, Government, Parliament and the Courts - should be continually reminded of the need to uphold civil liverties and human rights: that is why I supported the incorporation of the Convention into our law even when my Party opposed it. Furthermore, I see no reason why we should not also have regard to the judgements of Commonwealth countries based on our legal traditions outside Europe - of Canada and New Zealand which you do mention and of South Africa which you do not. <br><br> But the issue is not whether international judicial experience should be permitted to influence or guide our own deliberations, but whether our own judges and democratic institutions are so defective and incompetent that we cannot any longer be trusted to make our own decisions and be the master of own destiny - and whether our judges should be allowed to decide when the interests of the individual should take precedence over the interests of society as a whole. <br><br> I do not recall the British people being asked whether they wished our laws and legal judgements to be overridden by judges from different national traditions however renowned and distinguished. I suspect that I know what their answer would have been - and therefore why they were never asked! <br><br> Yours<br>Ivan Lawrence<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Ivan</b><br><br> I am glad to see you have \"come out\" as a supporter of the Human Rights Act (although I know this has always been your public position). You are right to raise the question of the need for more involvement of the people on matters relating to human rights. That is why we and others were disappointed that the government did not create a Human Rights Commission which could have helped to have informed the public (as well as providing much needed authoritive guidance to those in public bodies). <br><br> There is, however, to be a Human Rights Committee in Parliament which will help the Commons and the Lords to play their part in protecting human rights. It is unfortunate, however, that it has taken Parliament two years to set this Committee up, particularly because it will not even be in place when the Act comes into force in October. <br><br> One last matter about judges. This country now has the best set of judges we have ever had and they can be trusted to protect our rights. Nevertheless urgent action needs to be taken to appoint more women judges and judges from ethnic minority groups - we desperately need their expertise too. We also need to remove the power to appoint our judges from the government (in effect, the Lord Chancellor) and put it in the hands of an independent appointments committee. <br><br> Yours<br> John Wadham<br><br></p> <p> <b> Links:</b><br><br> <a href=\"http://www.penlex.org.uk/pages/eurcon.html\">Full details of the convention</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/\">Liberty</a></p>",
  "<p>Health inspectors will be authorised to check standards of care in private hospitals to ensure that patients are being properly treated in the wake of Alan Milburn's plans to expand the NHS's use of private medicine. </p> <p> Not only will staff of the NHS's Commission for Health Improvment (CHI) be able to monitor the treatment of taxpayer-funded patients in non-NHS hospitals, but there will be much closer interchange of personnel and information between the CHI and the private sector regulating body, it emerged last night. </p> <p>\"The private sector will have both watchdogs breathing down its neck from now on,\" one senior minister predicted last night. \"There will be movement between the two bodies.\" </p> <p> A series of scandals involving poor clinical judgement, notably the baby deaths at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, have rocked the NHS and forced the medical professions to accept tighter regulation and re-training regimes under the Blair-Milburn NHS Plan. </p> <p>But they have been matched by problems in the private sector - including gynaecology-related deaths at the Portland Hospital in central London and the death at another private hospital of businessman, Sir Michael Caine, husband of the Lib Dem peer, Emma Nicholson. </p> <p>Growing concern about the performance of some unregulated private hospitals merged with the government's change of heart towards the private sector in its NHS Plan to produce little noticed changes to the Care Standards Act last month shortly before it became law. </p> <p>Ministers refused to bow to pressure from Conservative and Liberal Democrat critics that CHI should be responsible for monitoring standards in both public and private health care sectors. </p> <p> Like Frank Dobson before him, the health secretary, Mr Milburn, insisted that a separate National Care Standards Commission (CSC) should act as watchdog on the private sector - with powers to shut down unsatisfactory hospitals which CHI cannot do. </p> <p>The CSC's main concern will be private nursing homes and residential care homes for old people and children. But it will also regulate the relatively-few private hospitals which do 900,000 operations a year for people who have private insurance or are \"self-payers.\" </p> <p>Under Mr Milburn's new \"concordat\" with the private sector some NHS patients will get their operations done in private hospitals. And the new rules will ensure that \"where a patient is an NHS patient being treated in a private hospital CHI's remit will follow that NHS patient.\" </p> <p>A department of health spokesman said last night:\" An NHS patient is an NHS patient. Regardless of where he or she is being treated CHI will adjudicate.\" Labour sources talk of private sector hospitals, previously unregulated, now being \"clobbered from both ends.\" </p> <p>Opposition MPs are more sceptical. Philip Hammond, the Tory health spokesman, said last night: \"the government realised that having two bodies there would expose them to ridicule if CHI (inspectors) went through a private hospital asking if there floor was clean under beds number 1, 3, 5 and 7 because they had NHS patients in them - but not under the other beds.\" </p> <p>Though the system is still to evolve in practice Mr Hammond predicted that CHI will end up delegating responsibility for actually monitoring NHS patients to the CSC. But the Care Standards Act, amended in the Commons by junior health minister, John Hutton, last month, will allow CHI staff to be seconded to the private sector regulatory body. </p> <p>In a separate development from the sweeping NHS Plan which Tony Blait unveiled before MPs left for the long recess a British Medical Journal article this week predicts that the effect of the plan's proposals for long-term care of the elderly will be to privatise sections of the NHS by stealth. </p> <p>Because NHS trusts will have an incentive to shift elderly patients into \"intermediate\" care to free up much-needed hospital beds the reforms are likely to produce a fast expansion of private sector nursing care - supervised by the CSC - says Professor Allyson Pollock of University College London's public policy unit. </p> <p>More and more patients will be expected to pay for their \"personal\"care she predicts.</p>",
  "There were fresh protests in Plymouth, Devon, last night outside the house of a convicted child molester as the parents of Sarah Payne pledged to stage a personal protest march on parliament if the government does not introduce laws to clamp down on sex offenders. <p>It also emerged that mother of five Katrina Kessell, 33, who led hundreds of protesters around the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth, has been reported to social services after her three-year-old son was found wandering naked half a mile from her home. </p> <p>Ms Kessell was being interviewed by a television station on Thursday morning when her son Nassar was found near a busy road by a passer-by. A report on the incident was forwarded to social workers by police as standard procedure. </p> <p>Last night the parents of murdered eight-year-old Sarah Payne called on protesters to end their demonstrations. </p> <p>But they said that if the government did not act within six months to introduce a so-called Sarah's Law, they would join the protesters and take their campaign directly to parliament. </p> <p>Sara Payne told Channel 4 News: \"What we say is, 'Don't be violent. Give us a chance to change the law.' People are listening now. The government is listening now. If in six months we haven't got anywhere, we will protest with you, but it will be peaceful. </p> <p>\"We will walk to London if we have to. We will walk to the House of Commons and sit there until they listen.\" </p> <p>She added: \"To say goodbye to Sarah... I don't know how we are going to do it. But if a change in the law is Sarah's legacy to the world, then it's a good legacy.\" </p> <p>On the Southway estate in Plymouth, where there were protests earlier this week, residents returned to demonstrate outside the home of 73-year-old Jan Goodliffe, a convicted sex offender, just hours after meeting a senior police officer. </p> <p>He was subjected to chants earlier this week by a placard-waving crowd and had a lump of concrete thrown through his window. Last night police were guarding his house against further attacks. </p> <p>Karen Jones, a Southway residents' spokeswoman, said the residents had heard nothing to persuade them to call off their demonstrations. </p> <p>\"We are continuing to protest,\" she said, adding that local people would be holding talks later to plan more action. </p> <p>Other protests on the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth were suspended after a number of families were driven from their homes. </p> <p>Mr Goodliffe said he could not afford to move and was not a threat to children, adding that he was not fearful for his own safety. He returned to the terraced house he owns on the estate last month after serving a four year sentence for indecently assaulting a 12-year-old boy.</p>",
  "Travellers using Eurotunnel's Folkestone-Calais shuttle service face the prospect of mounting disruption and delays from August 20 after the train drivers' union Aslef yesterday called an overtime ban over a long-running recognition dispute. <p>Aslef members who drive Eurotunnel's shuttle trains voted by 110 votes to seven to ban overtime, it was announced yesterday, in protest against the company's refusal to negotiate pay and conditions with the union. </p> <p>Instead, Eurotunnel - which has hitherto been the only train operator not to recognise unions - signed a single union deal in June with the Transport and General Workers' Union to represent all staff, under pressure from the new union recognition legislation. </p> <p>The dispute has come to a head at the peak period for cross-Channel traffic - last year nearly 1m cars and more than 200,000 lorries were carried on the shuttle during the summer. </p> <p>Eurotunnel's managing director Bill Dix said yesterday he was confident the industrial action would have little or no impact, because overtime on the shuttle service was \"extremely limited\" - less than 1% between January and June this year. </p> <p>But an Aslef spokesman said the union would hold a full-scale strike ballot if the company failed to respond and added that the union was also determined to improve Eurotunnel drivers' pay, which at an average of \u00a318,000 a year was the lowest in the country. </p> <p>\"Eurotunnel should talk to Aslef before their industrial intransigence inconveniences the public,\" said the union's general secretary Mick Rix.</p>",
  "<p>This is the history of a failure. It descends into anecdotic detail, as one would expect in episodes from a war, but this is blended with reflections and critical analysis. For in my view, any importance the story might have lies in the fact that it allows the experiences to be extracted for the use of other revolutionary movements. </p> <p>Victory is a great source of positive experiences, but so is defeat, especially if the unusual circumstances surrounding the incident are taken into account: the actors and informants are foreigners who went to risk their lives in an unknown land where people spoke a different language and were linked to them only by ties of proletarian internationalism, so that a method not practised in modern wars of liberation was thereby inaugurated. </p> <p>These notes will be published some time after they were dictated, and it may be that the author will no longer be able to take responsibility for what is said in them. </p> <p>More correctly, this is the history of a decomposition. When we arrived on Congolese soil, the revolution was in a period of reflux; then a number of incidents occurred which brought about its final regression, at this time and place at least, in the immense field of struggle that is the Congo. </p> <p>The most interesting aspect here is not the story of the decomposition of the Congolese revolution, whose causes and key features are too profound to be all encompassed from my particular vantage point, but rather the decomposition of our own fighting morale, since the experience we inaugurated should not go to waste and the initiative of the International Proletarian Army should not die at the first failure. It is essential to analyse in depth the problems that are posed, and to find a solution to them. A good battlefield instructor does more for the revolution than one who teaches a large number of raw recruits in a context of peace... </p> <p>The idea that guided us was to ensure that men experienced in liberation battles (and subsequently in the struggle with reactionary forces) fought alongside men without experience, and thereby bring about what we called the \"Cubanisation\" of the Congolese. It will be seen that the effect was the exact opposite, in that a \"Congolisation\" of the Cubans took place over a period of time. In speaking of Congolisation, we had in mind the series of habits and attitudes to the revolution that characterised the Congolese soldier at those moments of the struggle. This does not imply any derogatory view about the Congolese people, but it does about the soldiers at that time. In the course of the story, an attempt will be made to explain why those fighters had such negative traits. </p> <p><strong> Letter to Castro</strong><br> </p> <p> A personal letter written by Che Guevara to Fidel Castro in October 1965 shows the strength of trust between the two men, despite Guevara having left Cuba. Only to Castro could Guevara so openly express his serious doubts about the Congo project, given the competition between rival leaders in different areas. </p> <p>Congo, 5/10/65 </p> <p>Dear Fidel </p> <p>I received your letter, which has aroused contradictory feelings in me - for in the name of proletarian internationalism, we are committing mistakes that may prove very costly. I am also personally worried that, either because I have failed to write with sufficient seriousness or because you do not fully understand me, I may be thought to be suffering from the terrible disease of groundless pessimism. </p> <p>When your Greek gift [Emilio Aragones, a member of the Cuban central committee] arrived here, he told me that one of my letters had given the impression of a condemned gladiator, and the [Cuban health] minister [Jose Ramon Machado Ventura], in passing on your optimistic message, confirmed the opinion that you were forming. </p> <p>You will be able to speak at length with the bearer of this letter who will tell you his firsthand impressions after visiting much of the front; for this reason I will dispense with anecdotes. I will just say to you that, according to people close to me here, I have lost my reputation for objectivity by maintaining a groundless optimism in the face of the actual situation. I can assure you that were it not for me, this fine dream would have collapsed with catastrophe all around. </p> <p>In my previous letters, I asked to be sent not many people but cadres; there is no real lack of arms here (except for special weapons) - indeed there are too many armed men; what is lacking are soldiers. I especially warned that no more money should be given out unless it was with a dropper and after many requests. None of what I said has been heeded, and fantastic plans have been made which threaten to discredit us internationally and may land me in a very difficult position. </p> <p>I shall now explain to you. </p> <p>Soumialot [Gaston Soumialot, president of the Supreme Council of the Revolution] and his comrades have been leading you all right up the garden path. It would be tedious to list the huge number of lies they have spun. </p> <p>There are two zones where something of an organised revolution exists - the one where we ourselves are, and part of Kasai province (the great unknown quantity) where Mulele [Pierre Mulele, former minister under Lumumba and the first leader to take up arms] is based. </p> <p>In the rest of the country there are bands living in the forest, not connected to one another; they lost everything without a fight, as they lost Stanleyville without a fight. More serious than this, however, is the way in which the groups in this area (the only one with contacts to the outside) relate to one another. </p> <p>The dissensions between Kabila [then second vice-president of the Supreme Council of the Revolution and head of the eastern front where Guevara was] and Soumialot are becoming more serious all the time, and are used as a pretext to keep handing towns over without a fight. I know Kabila well enough not to have any illusions about him. I cannot say the same about Soumialot, but I have some indications such as the string of lies he has been feeding you, the fact that he does not deign to come to these godforsaken parts, his frequent bouts of drunkenness in Dar es Salaam, where he lives in the best hotels, and the kind of people he has as allies here against the other group. </p> <p>Recently a group from the Tshombist [pro-government] army landed, in the Baraka area (where a major-general loyal to Soumialot has no fewer than a thousand armed men) and captured this strategically important place almost without a fight. Now they are arguing about who was to blame - those who did not put up a fight, or those at the lake who did not send enough ammunition. The fact is that they shamelessly ran away, ditching in the open a 75mm recoilless gun and two 82 mortars; all the men assigned to these weapons have disappeared, and now they are asking me for Cubans to get them back from wherever they are (no one quite knows where) and to use them in battle. </p> <p>Nor are they doing anything to defend Fizi, 36km from here; they don't want to dig trenches on the only access road through the mountains. This will give you a faint idea of the situation. As for the need to choose men well rather than send me large numbers, you and the commissar assure me that the men here are good; I'm sure most of them are - otherwise they'd have quit long ago. But that's not the point. You have to be really well tempered to put up with the things that happen here. It's not good men but supermen that are needed... </p> <p>And there are still my 200; believe me, they would do more harm than good at the present time - unless we decide once and for all to fight alone, in which case we'll need a division and we'll have to see how many the enemy put up against us. Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration; maybe a battalion would be enough to get back to the frontiers we had when we arrived here and to threaten Albertville. </p> <p>But numbers are not what matters; we can't liberate by ourselves a country that does not want to fight; you've got to create a fighting spirit and look for soldiers with the torch of Diogenes and the patience of Job - a task that becomes more difficult, the more shits there are doing things along the way. </p> <p>The business with the money is what hurts me most, after all the warnings I gave. At the height of my \"spending spree\" and only after they had kicked up a lot of fuss, I undertook to supply one front (the most important one) on condition that I would direct the struggle and form a special mixed column under my direct command, in accordance with the strategy that I outlined and communicated to you. </p> <p>With a very heavy heart, I calculated that it would require $5,000 a month. Now I learn that a sum 20 times higher is given to people who pass through just once, so that they can live well in all the capitals of the African world, with no allowance for the fact that they receive free board and lodging and often their travel costs from the main progressive countries. Not a cent will reach a wretched front where the peasants suffer every misery you can imagine, including the rapaciousness of their own protectors; nor will anything get through to the poor devils stuck In Sudan. (Whisky and women are not on the list of expenses covered by friendly governments, and they cost a lot if you want quality.) </p> <p>Finally, 50 doctors will give the liberated area of the Congo an enviable proportion of one per thousand inhabitants - a level surpassed only by the USSR, the United States and two or three of the most advanced countries in the world. But no allowance is made for the fact that here they are distributed according to political preference, without a trace of public health organisation. Instead of such gigantism, it would be better to send a contingent of revolutionary doctors and to increase it as I request, along with highly practical nurses of a similar kind. </p> <p>As the attached map sums up the military situation, I shall limit myself to a few recommendations that I would ask you all to consider objectively: forget all the men in charge of phantom groups; train up to a hundred cadres (not necessarily all blacks)... As for weapons: the new bazooka, percussion caps with their own power supply, a few R-4s and nothing else for the moment; forget about rifles, which won't solve anything unless they are electronic. Our mortars must be in Tanzania, and with those plus a new complement of men to operate them we would have more than enough for now. Forget about Burundi and tactfully discuss the question of the launches. (Don't forget that Tanzania is an independent country and we've got to play it fair there, leaving aside the little problem I caused.) </p> <p>Send the mechanics as soon as possible, as well as someone who can steer across the lake reasonably safely; that has been discussed and Tanzania has agreed. Leave me to handle the problem of the doctors, which I will do by giving some of them to Tanzania. Don't make the mistake again of dishing out money like that; for they cling to me when they feel hard up and certainly won't pay me any attention if the money is flowing freely. Trust my judgment a little and don't go by appearances. Shake the representatives into giving truthful information, because they are not capable of figuring things out and present utopian pictures which have nothing to do with reality. </p> <p>I have tried to be explicit and objective, synthetic and truthful. Do you believe me? </p> <p>Warm greetings ... </p> <p><strong> Evacuation</strong><br> </p> <p> By November 1965 Guevara's dream had collapsed against the reality of the Congolese forces' complete incompetence and lack of realism. Grimly he had asked Havana for help to pull out his men, though he toyed with the idea of staying on as a lone exemplar of revolutionary duty. </p> <p>There was an almost complete disintegration of the troops; some party members even proposed to hold a meeting to ask me to pull out. I was extremely sharp in my replies, warning that I would not accept any such demand or any meeting of that kind and would treat it as treachery, and that I would brand as cowardice even any act of allowing such proposals to circulate. I still had a remnant of authority which kept some degree of cohesion among the Cubans; that was all. But much worse things were happening on the Congolese side. </p> <p>This paragraph will give some idea of the limbo in which the revolution was then sailing. I will take the liberty of reproducing for you the aspirations, wishes and proposals of the whole population in the Fizi region. </p> <p>1. The people demand that the military power of our revolution should be entrusted to the friendly forces who are coming to help us, until the country is stabilised. </p> <p>2. The people request intensive aid from friendly countries, consisting of: </p> <p>a) military operations, personnel, weapons, equipment, money, etc; </p> <p>b) technical assistance, engineers, various kinds of technicians, doctors, etc; </p> <p>c) social assistance, teachers, traders, industrialists. </p> <p>At 2.30pm we made contact with [the Tanzanian port of] Kigoma. Our message read: Changa: [the Cuban captain responsible for transporting supplies and messages] Total men to evacuate less than 200, will be more difficult each day that passes. We are at Sele, 10 or 15km south of Kibamba. </p> <p>And I received the longed-for reply. </p> <p>Tatu: The crossing is set for tonight. Yesterday the commissioner did not let us cross. </p> <p>The men were euphoric. I spoke with Masengo [the chief of staff of the eastern front] and suggested leaving from that very point at night. As there were a lot of Congolese, the general staff held a meeting at which it was decided that one commander would remain in the Congo with his men and we and the various leaders would evacuate; the troops who were originally from that area would remain there; they would not be told of our intention to withdraw but would be sent on various pretexts to the nearby village. </p> <p>One of the little boats we still had to ply between various points on the lake arrived and took a large number of the Congolese, but those who were part of our force smelt a rat and wanted to stay. I ordered a selection to be made of those who had conducted themselves best up to that point, so that they would be taken across as Cubans. </p> <p>For me it was a critical situation. Two men who had comprehensively fulfilled their mission would now be left behind unless they made their way back within a few hours. The full weight of calumnies - both inside and outside the Congo -would fall upon us as soon as we left. My troops were a mixed bunch, and my investigations suggested that I could extract up to 20 to follow me, this time with knitted brows. And then what would I do? All the leaders were pulling out, the peasants were displaying ever greater hostility towards us. But I was deeply pained at the thought of simply departing as we had come, leaving behind defenceless peasants and armed men whose poor battle sense left them effectively defenceless, defeated and with a feeling of betrayal. </p> <p>For me, to stay in the Congo was not a sacrifice - not for a year, or even for the five years with which I had scared my men. It was part of a concept of struggle that had fully taken shape in my brain. I could reasonably expect six or eight men to accompany me without furrowed brows. But the rest would do it as a duty, either towards me personally, or as a moral duty to the revolution; I would be sacrificing people who could not muster any enthusiasm to fight. </p> <p>In reality, the thought of remaining in the Congo continued to haunt me long into the night, and perhaps I did not so much take the decision as become one fugitive more. The way in which the Congolese comrades would view the evacuation seemed to me degrading; our withdrawal was a mere flight, or worse, we were accomplices in the deception with which people had been left on the land. </p> <p>Moreover, who was I now? I had the feeling that, after my farewell letter to Fidel, the comrades began to see me as a man from other climes rather distant from Cuba's specific problems, and I could not bring myself to demand the final sacrifice of remaining behind. I spent the final hours like this, alone and perplexed, until the boats eventually put in at two o'clock in the morning, with a Cuban crew who arrived and set off immediately that very night. </p> <p>There were too many people for the boats at that late hour. I set three o'clock as the last possible hour for departure, since it would be daylight at 5.30 and we would be in the middle of the lake. Work got under way on organising the evacuation. The sick went aboard, then the whole of Masengo's general staff - some 40 men chosen by himself - and finally all the Cubans. It was a plaintive, inglorious spectacle; I had to chase away men who kept imploring us to take them too; there was no element of grandeur in this retreat, no gesture of defiance. The machine-guns were in position, and I kept the men at the ready, as usual, in case they tried to intimidate us by attacking from the land. But nothing like that happened. There was just a lot of grumbling, while the leader of the would-be escapees cursed in time with the beating of the loose moorings. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502447371,00.html\">Buy the book from BOL</a></p>",
  "In 1965 Che Guevara embarked on the most dramatic of his several ambitious attempts to change the world, writes <b>Victoria Brittain</b>. <p> Undercover, known only as \"Tatu\" (number three in swahili), the 37-year-old led a group of Cuban guerrillas into eastern Congo . There, several rebellions had begun, invoking the radical name and ideas of Patrice Lumumba, the prime minister at independence who had been killed in 1961, probably by Belgians, certainly on the orders of the United States. </p> <p>Few people realised in the mid 1960s how important the Congo's client government was to be to Washington, and how deeply the CIA was involved in making sure that the men Guevara was working with would fail. </p> <p>Guevara's personal account of this catastrophic venture lay under wraps in Havana for thirty years, and is only now being published in full. </p> <p>In the 1970s and 80s, when the cold war raged in Africa, and Cuban soldiers, doctors and teachers stood between utter failure and relative success in countries such as Angola and Ethiopia, this document would have been a gift to Cuba's enemies, notably in the US, which was working tirelessly to bring down such leftwing regimes. </p> <p>Guevara's version of events has an honesty which has long since gone out of fashion. His diary gives an intimate picture of the harsh deprivations of the world of all guerrilla movements: the uncertainties, the mind-torturing moral doubts, the frustrations of lack of funds and the in-fighting. </p> <p>All this will make salutary reading for the next generation of foreign radicals who, for the past four years, have been trying to change the course of Congolese history. The story today is an astonishing mirror of what Guevara saw: a rebel movement fractured into three parts, as ready to fight each other as to take on the army of the weak central government in Kinshasa, and dependent on outsiders to function at all. </p> <p>And, as in Guevara's time, the central government is only held in power by the intervention of outsiders. But, in these post-cold war times, these outsiders are Africans, not westerners. Guevara's heirs have come from Rwanda, Uganda and Angola and they are living with the same realities described by Guevara - and have even found one of the old rebel leaders Guevara did not think too highly of: Laurent Kabila, now on the other side as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p> <p><b><a name=\"diary\">What follows are three extracts from Guevara's diary: </a> </b> </p> <p> This is the history of a failure.

(Whisky and women are not on the list of expenses covered by friendly governments, and they cost a lot if you want quality.) </p> <p>Finally, 50 doctors will give the liberated area of the Congo an enviable proportion of one per thousand inhabitants - a level surpassed only by the USSR, the United States and two or three of the most advanced countries in the world. But no allowance is made for the fact that here they are distributed according to political preference, without a trace of public health organisation. Instead of such gigantism, it would be better to send a contingent of revolutionary doctors and to increase it as I request, along with highly practical nurses of a similar kind. </p> <p>As the attached map sums up the military situation, I shall limit myself to a few recommendations that I would ask you all to consider objectively: forget all the men in charge of phantom groups; train up to a hundred cadres (not necessarily all blacks)... As for weapons: the new bazooka, percussion caps with their own power supply, a few R-4s and nothing else for the moment; forget about rifles, which won't solve anything unless they are electronic. Our mortars must be in Tanzania, and with those plus a new complement of men to operate them we would have more than enough for now. Forget about Burundi and tactfully discuss the question of the launches. (Don't forget that Tanzania is an independent country and we've got to play it fair there, leaving aside the little problem I caused.) </p> <p>Send the mechanics as soon as possible, as well as someone who can steer across the lake reasonably safely; that has been discussed and Tanzania has agreed. Leave me to handle the problem of the doctors, which I will do by giving some of them to Tanzania. Don't make the mistake again of dishing out money like that; for they cling to me when they feel hard up and certainly won't pay me any attention if the money is flowing freely. Trust my judgment a little and don't go by appearances. Shake the representatives into giving truthful information, because they are not capable of figuring things out and present utopian pictures which have nothing to do with reality. </p> <p>I have tried to be explicit and objective, synthetic and truthful. Do you believe me? </p> <p>Warm greetings ... </p> <p><b> Evacuation</b><br> </p> <p> By November 1965 Guevara's dream had collapsed against the reality of the Congolese forces' complete incompetence and lack of realism. Grimly he had asked Havana for help to pull out his men, though he toyed with the idea of staying on as a lone exemplar of revolutionary duty. </p> <p>There was an almost complete disintegration of the troops; some party members even proposed to hold a meeting to ask me to pull out. I was extremely sharp in my replies, warning that I would not accept any such demand or any meeting of that kind and would treat it as treachery, and that I would brand as cowardice even any act of allowing such proposals to circulate. I still had a remnant of authority which kept some degree of cohesion among the Cubans; that was all. But much worse things were happening on the Congolese side. </p> <p>This paragraph will give some idea of the limbo in which the revolution was then sailing. I will take the liberty of reproducing for you the aspirations, wishes and proposals of the whole population in the Fizi region. </p> <p>1. The people demand that the military power of our revolution should be entrusted to the friendly forces who are coming to help us, until the country is stabilised. </p> <p>2. The people request intensive aid from friendly countries, consisting of: </p> <p>a) military operations, personnel, weapons, equipment, money, etc; </p> <p>b) technical assistance, engineers, various kinds of technicians, doctors, etc; </p> <p>c) social assistance, teachers, traders, industrialists. </p> <p>At 2.30pm we made contact with [the Tanzanian port of] Kigoma. Our message read: Changa: [the Cuban captain responsible for transporting supplies and messages] Total men to evacuate less than 200, will be more difficult each day that passes. We are at Sele, 10 or 15km south of Kibamba. </p> <p>And I received the longed-for reply. </p> <p>Tatu: The crossing is set for tonight. Yesterday the commissioner did not let us cross. </p> <p>The men were euphoric. I spoke with Masengo [the chief of staff of the eastern front] and suggested leaving from that very point at night. As there were a lot of Congolese, the general staff held a meeting at which it was decided that one commander would remain in the Congo with his men and we and the various leaders would evacuate; the troops who were originally from that area would remain there; they would not be told of our intention to withdraw but would be sent on various pretexts to the nearby village. </p> <p>One of the little boats we still had to ply between various points on the lake arrived and took a large number of the Congolese, but those who were part of our force smelt a rat and wanted to stay. I ordered a selection to be made of those who had conducted themselves best up to that point, so that they would be taken across as Cubans. </p> <p>For me it was a critical situation. Two men who had comprehensively fulfilled their mission would now be left behind unless they made their way back within a few hours. The full weight of calumnies - both inside and outside the Congo -would fall upon us as soon as we left. My troops were a mixed bunch, and my investigations suggested that I could extract up to 20 to follow me, this time with knitted brows. And then what would I do? All the leaders were pulling out, the peasants were displaying ever greater hostility towards us. But I was deeply pained at the thought of simply departing as we had come, leaving behind defenceless peasants and armed men whose poor battle sense left them effectively defenceless, defeated and with a feeling of betrayal. </p> <p>For me, to stay in the Congo was not a sacrifice - not for a year, or even for the five years with which I had scared my men. It was part of a concept of struggle that had fully taken shape in my brain. I could reasonably expect six or eight men to accompany me without furrowed brows. But the rest would do it as a duty, either towards me personally, or as a moral duty to the revolution; I would be sacrificing people who could not muster any enthusiasm to fight. </p> <p>In reality, the thought of remaining in the Congo continued to haunt me long into the night, and perhaps I did not so much take the decision as become one fugitive more. The way in which the Congolese comrades would view the evacuation seemed to me degrading; our withdrawal was a mere flight, or worse, we were accomplices in the deception with which people had been left on the land. </p> <p>Moreover, who was I now? I had the feeling that, after my farewell letter to Fidel, the comrades began to see me as a man from other climes rather distant from Cuba's specific problems, and I could not bring myself to demand the final sacrifice of remaining behind. I spent the final hours like this, alone and perplexed, until the boats eventually put in at two o'clock in the morning, with a Cuban crew who arrived and set off immediately that very night. </p> <p>There were too many people for the boats at that late hour. I set three o'clock as the last possible hour for departure, since it would be daylight at 5.30 and we would be in the middle of the lake. Work got under way on organising the evacuation. The sick went aboard, then the whole of Masengo's general staff - some 40 men chosen by himself - and finally all the Cubans. It was a plaintive, inglorious spectacle; I had to chase away men who kept imploring us to take them too; there was no element of grandeur in this retreat, no gesture of defiance. The machine-guns were in position, and I kept the men at the ready, as usual, in case they tried to intimidate us by attacking from the land. But nothing like that happened. There was just a lot of grumbling, while the leader of the would-be escapees cursed in time with the beating of the loose moorings. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502447371,00.html\">Buy the book from BOL</a></p>",
  "<p>Contrary to what you may have been led to believe there are four inevitabilities in life - death, taxes, a lucrative book deal for Big Brother's Nick Bateman and a victory for the Second Division leaders Northamptonshire today. </p> <p>The latter has looked likely since tea on the second day by which time the fifth-wicket pair of Russell Warren and Tony Penberthy had become entrenched on their way to a double-century partnership. The logic of Graeme Swann and Jason Brown then successfully exploiting a large first-innings lead on a helpful surface was irresistible. </p> <p>At present Brown and Swann are the county game's hottest double act. They are not playing to sell-out crowds but are very popular among their colleagues. Their combined wickets-per-game ratio is better than that of the Saqlain-Salisbury partnership at Surrey and, with Brown taking the lead, they spun out the Sussex top order. Brown has taken six for 70 and, in only six championship matches, he is on 49 for the season. </p> <p>Only an aggressive sixth-wicket stand of 91 between Tony Cottey and Umer Rashid and a dropped catch in the penultimate over averted a three-day defeat for the visitors. Prepared to sweep and use his feet, Cottey was the one batsmen to play with any conviction against the spinners and, shortly before the close, he reached his second century of the season with a six. </p> <p>It was d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu when Sussex batted again 228 runs behind. For the second time in the match Richard Montgomerie was lbw for 10 in Darren Cousins' second over, and once again Swann took a wicket in his first, Matthew Hayden holding a sharp slip catch to dismiss Wasim Khan. </p> <p>Chris Adams experienced it as well. He was immediately confronted by the canny six/three offside field that had been devised specially for him. For a while Adams looked in control but then Sussex ran into the umpire Roy Palmer. He adjudged that Toby Pierce had edged a catch to David Ripley in Brown's first over and followed up by sending the Sussex captain on his way, lbw to the same bowler for 15. Robin Martin-Jenkins then walked after sending a looping catch to short-leg five balls later. </p> <p>When Northamptonshire had resumed in the morning on 327 for four, their immediate challenge was to achieve maximum batting points and deny Sussex another bowling point. They failed in both tasks. Penberthy added four to his overnight 92 before he was lbw to James Kirtley, and Swann was run out on 30. </p> <p>Northamptonshire needed six from the 130th over - the cut-off for bonus points - to reach 400. It yielded only a single as Warren and the new batsman David Ripley perversely chose to block. It would be unfair to criticise Warren, however. His eight-hour innings of 151 had set up the winning position, after all.</p>",
  "<p>Essex should win here this afternoon, the final day of this Second Division match, and with some comfort, but there was a thrilling counter-attack by Worcestershire yesterday that was so brave and futile it had the whiff of Lord Cardigan and Balaklava about it. </p> <p>Worcestershire trailed Essex by 160 runs on the first innings, and were 10 for two in their second, when Graeme Hick was joined by Vikram Solanki. These batsmen are not famous for stonewalling but Essex hardly expected a partnership of 136 in 28 overs. </p> <p>Hick, at his most powerful, struck 15 fours in his 93-ball 75; Solanki faced 82 balls and hit 10 fours in his 56. They were out within eight balls of each other and the scattered vultures settled again. But while they were together they threatened to take the match away from Essex. </p> <p>Essex had resumed at 461 for nine and added just one run before Barry Hyam was caught behind. Their lead was largely funded by the 76 extras, which included 52 no-balls. </p> <p>When Worcestershire batted again they lost Philip Weston, lbw shouldering arms to Ronnie Irani, and Elliott Wilson, bowled by Ashley Cowan. Solanki then joined Hick, who was still smarting from his first innings, when he was bowled without playing a stroke. </p> <p>Yesterday Hick was at his best. He reached his fifty by hitting Peter Such for a straight and lofted four before, next ball, he cut him behind square for another. Solanki, pulling and driving, was even more exotic with his strokeplay. </p> <p>At lunch Worcestershire were 132 for two and Hick and Solanki had added 122 in 91 minutes. The watching Test selector Geoff Miller must have been impressed on the weekend when the England team is chosen. But nothing Hick does in county cricket these days is likely to count for much. </p> <p>Solanki had added just four when he was caught by Stuart Law at second slip. In the following over Hick attempted to cut Irani but chopped on. Hick has rarely appeared so cross with himself. Three times he swished at the air in self-reproach. Both wickets had fallen for 146 and Worcestershire were still 14 behind. </p> <p>While Hick and Solanki defended with the sword, Paul Pollard and David Leatherdale chose the barn-door approach. Their partnership yielded 100 runs. Then Worcestershire lost six wickets for 36. Pollard followed his century with 69. </p> <p>The bravest cricket yesterday, though, came not from Hick and Solanki but from Irani and Cowan. On a good wicket with a fast outfield the Essex attack, without Mark Ilott and Ricky Anderson, looked as threadbare as Mother Hubbard's old sofa. But Irani and Cowan kept charging in and finished with five wickets apiece.</p>",

  "<p>Matt Barrett is the big boss of the big bank for the big world. The chief executive of Barclays has a big pay packet to boot. In fact, everything about the 55-year-old Irish-born Canadian is big: his voice, his personality and even his moustache. </p> <p>Yesterday, he made his bank, which really was never quite as big as its crass advertising campaign made out, a fair deal bigger. In his first major strategic step since taking the helm of Barclays last October, Barrett confirmed yesterday that he had reached agreement to take over Woolwich, the former building society, with an aim to becoming a big player in the mortgage market and an even bigger one in cyberspace.</p> <p>In his big office, where a cigarette is smouldering on a big ashtray, smooth-talking Barrett is having trouble remembering when he last went to sleep. The nature of the City when big deals are being done, especially one that leaked as his did, means that time is precious and the demands of lawyers and investment bankers ensure that chief executives get little time to themselves when the delicate final details are being put together.</p> <p>Barrett, unknown in Britain until recently, is in good humour although flagging just a little. Already, he has talked to City analysts, held a press conference, given radio and telephone interviews and been photographed more times than he can remember. Pulling at his cheeks, aching from so much smiling at the camera, talking suddenly seems the preferred option.</p> <p>Since arriving in Britain in October from Canada, where he lived for the best part of 30 years, to take the helm he acknowledges that Barclays has had a few \"bumps\". From cash machine charges, branch closures and the potential size of Barrett\u00d5s pay deal, the bank seemed unable to get anything right in the public\u00d5s eyes. The situation was made worse by the \"big\" advertising campaign, which Barrett describes as \"an unfortunate confluence of events\".</p> <p>The advertising campaigns, featuring films stars such as Sir Anthony Hopkins, were not intended to portray Barclays as bragging about its size, says Barrett. Taken on their own, away from the controversy that was simmering away, they were supposed to show that \"big is also friendly\".</p> <p>With uncharacteristic understatement, Barrett acknowledges \"perhaps it wasn\u00d5t the greatest positioning\" as they reinforce the bank\u00d5s apparent insensitivity. Branches were being closed in rural communities where the bank was often the last one left on the high street, wreaths were hung above some branches and the negative publicity machine raged out of control.</p> <p>The ad\u00d5s message, though, was that as a big bank, Barclays had an array of talent, \"a richness\" to do things for its customers that smaller banks might not be able to.</p> <p>Tanned and immaculately dressed, Barrett\u00d5s good-natured banter is tempered slightly when discussing the image Barclays has battled with during his 10 months in charge. Perhaps, his critics have said, he should have taken a tougher stance with his managers earlier than he did to try to nip the disasters in the bud sooner.</p> <p>\"The train was still going through the station,\" he says, as he tries to explain that he could not just storm into Barclays and demand changes from the moment he arrived. Barclays has lost two chief executives in the space of a year, one of whom lasted only a day in job.</p> <p>Second choice as chief executive, Barrett had to get know the bank and put it in the context of Europe\u00d5s financial services, and not the north American market with which he was more familiar. \"Part of the leadership challenge is giving direction and change. I\u00d5d like to have gotten all that in place earlier... but no regrets,\" he says.</p> <p>He was only appointed chief executive after Michael O\u00d5Neill, a former American marine, resigned after one day in the job on health grounds. The bank had seemed to take a long time to find Mr O\u00d5Neill as the replacement for ex-Etonian Martin Taylor who walked out after a board room rift.</p> <p>In all, Barclays was run by its chairman Sir Peter Middleton, who added the chief executive title to his role, for almost a year before Barrett arrived. The City was anxious for action from a bank that appeared to be in danger of losing ground at a time when NatWest, its closest rival on the high street, was being assaulted by two Scottish banks half its size. The outcome of the battle propelled Royal Bank of Scotland above Barclays in terms of its stock market size and, without the Woolwich deal, left Barclays in real risk of being relegated to fourth place between HSBC, the Royal Bank and Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>While Barrett was Barclays\u00d5 second attempt at finding a chief executive, many City sources believe that Woolwich was Barrett\u00d5s second choice too. He is enigmatic when asked whether he had really tried to persuade Ian Harley, the dour Scottish chief executive of Abbey National, to sell out to Barclays just a few weeks ago.</p> <p>\"Woolwich is head and shoulders above its peer group in the UK,\" he says. \"One studied the competition. From our point of view they were the number one. We felt great we got together.\"</p> <p>The Woolwich deal is the beginning of a new chapter for Barclays. The poor publicity, the insensitive branch closures and cash machine charges are all in the past. The Woolwich deal is \"about the future\". There is a new injection of management \"folk\" from the Woolwich, including John Stewart, its chief executive who is to become deputy chief executive of Barclays, a new \"radical\" strategy approved by the Barclays board.</p> <p>\"Customer friendly\" is the bank\u00d5s new mantra, he insists. \"It sounds trite but it\u00d5s really a good ethos,\" he says. \"The most important piece of real estate in the organisation is the three feet between front line personnel and the customers. You succeed or fail on the service to the customer.\" He admits to \"agonising\" over why it is \"no one loves bankers\". \"It\u00d5s because there\u00d5s nothing inherently pleasing about going to a bank,\" he adds. It might also be because bankers rarely do little to help themselves. At times Barrett himself has sounded insensitive, telling a panel of MPs he was \"a bargain\" and side-stepping their questions in a manner to which they were not quite accustomed. Even the City has had difficulty deciding how to read Barrett and deciding whether the man, who shares few characteristics with any of his predecessors at Barclays, can really \"walk the talk\" as he had promised.</p> <p>Although he sounds north American \u00d1 his speech is littered with \"gottens\" \u00d1 Barrett is Irish by birth, born just towards the end of the second world war in County Kerry. It was not a charmed life: \"I am not to the manor born,\" he explains. His only source of education was the Christian Brothers School in Kells. He then escaped to London to join the Bank of Montreal as a cashier. Within just five years, his talents had been spotted and he was transferred to the bank\u00d5s headquarters in Montreal as a management trainee.</p> <p>He began his way up the career ladder with no real intention of crossing the Atlantic again. By the age of 45, he was chairman of Bank of Montreal, and one of the few bankers to achieve such an influential position at such a young age. At Bank of Montreal, he was behind the creation of an internet bank in the US. The experience of Barclays\u00d5 own internet bank running into problems recently cannot have been pleasant. The acquisition of Woolwich, credited for its expertise in new distribution channels such as the internet and mobile phones, is expected to give Barclays a fresh approach to the internet.</p> <p>The deal has also allowed Barrett to succeed where he failed in Canada, provided no rival bidders step in or competition commissioners become interested. His dream to merge his Bank of Montreal with its close rival Royal Bank of Canada was blocked on competition grounds. He retired shortly afterwards and has tried to play down the connection between the two events.</p> <p>Along with his accent, his management style is north American too. He talks about \"human capital\" and staff morale. And despite his apparently different style to the Woolwich\u00d5s no-nonsense John Stewart, he insists there is a real bonding. With the Woolwich team on board, he has a management team which is \"best in breed\" and which would \"stack up\" against the management of any of the banks he has encountered during his career.</p> <p>\"I wouldn\u00d5t trade any of them. It does not mean any of us are perfect, God knows, including myself,\" he says. While his eyes still betray his Irish blood, he made Canada his home and became part of the establishment. He was even awarded the Officer of the Order of Canada, the country\u00d5s highest civilian order. He became a well known public figure, not just for his business prowess but for his private life. This might have helped harden him for the British media.</p> <p>The first taster that he was from a different mould to many of the other chief executives in British bank\u00d5s boardrooms, came after his appointment as chief executive last year. The tabloids had even more fun with semi-nude pictures of his estranged second wife Anne-Marie Sten posted on the internet than the enormous size of his remuneration package. His total deal was estimated to be in the region of \u00a36m, a figure dwarfed by headlines generated earlier this year at a potential performance-related bonus which might net him \u00a330m, provided the share price soars.</p> <p>Of the media, he says: \"It goes with the turf. You accept what goes with the turf.\" He does admit, however, to being frustrated by criticism from people who have never met him.</p> <p>Barrett does not need to work. He was on his way to retirement when Barclays lured him, insists money has never been his motivater, even when he started out as a bank clerk. \"I was interested in survival,\" he says. \"I didn\u00d5t know much about share options. I was just trying to pay my rent in a northern part of London.\"</p> <p>Being motivated by money can often be a sign of being \"doomed to failure\". The most important thing, according to him, is to find something that is enjoyable. \"The rest will take care of itself,\" he says.</p> <p>Barrett admits that he had always fancied a Bohemian lifestyle. He had initially thought that journalism would allow him to achieve this aim. Deciding he was not a good enough writer to win the Pulitzer prize, he chose banking. \"The antithesis\", he smiles, recalling his friends\u00d5 startled reactions during a period when 1960s were in full swing.</p> <p>But, he has fun as a banker. \"It\u00d5s really a people business. You deal with money and people\u00d5s money. You see people at times of great triumph and great crisis,\" he says.</p> <p>The Bohemian streak, however, is only temporarily repressed. Just as he was being persuaded to take the role at Barclays, Barrett was looking for a new home in Mexico where, again, he was going to give writing another try. \"Banking seems to be my destiny,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong>Matthew Barrett </strong></p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> September 20, 1944 in Country Kerry, Ireland</p> <p><strong>Educated:</strong> Christian Brothers School, Kells, Ireland;<br>Harvard Business School advanced management<br>progamme (1981).</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> Bank of Montreal (1962-1999), various<br>positions beginning in London and culminating in his<br>appointment as chairman of the board in 1990.</p> <p><strong>Outside work:</strong> Two times married, once divorced and<br>legally separated from his second wife.

  "<p>The takeover panel's attempt to orchestrate a clean finish to the four-month takeover battle for Hyder by insisting on sealed bids fell apart yesterday when one of the bidders appealed against the procedure. </p> <p>Nomura, the Japanese bank which started the bid battle for Hyder at the end of March, is understood to have objected to the result of the sealed bid procedure imposed by the panel executive on Thursday. </p> <p>A full meeting of the takeover panel was under way last night to adjudicate on Nomura's last-minute appeal. US energy group Western Power Distribution was confident that it had outbid its Japanese rival in the two-horse race. </p> <p>The panel executive said on Thursday that any new or increased offers for Hyder would have to be made through the submission of sealed bids by 1pm yesterday and the result announced by the winner by 4.30pm. </p> <p>It is understood that Nomura did not increase its 360p a share offer and WPD made a higher offer in its sealed bid. However, WPD failed to make its announcement by 4.30pm and Nomura claimed that it was therefore invalid. </p> <p>Nomura said that it would increase its offer to 365p so shareholders would not lose out because of a technicality. </p> <p>The panel was last night trying to decide which of the 365p bids should be declared the winner. </p> <p>The panel executive imposed the sealed bid routine because it wanted to avoid a scramble seconds ahead of the bid deadline of midnight on Friday. It is only the second time such a procedure has been proposed. On the previous occasion, during bidding for Energy Group two years ago, it was disrupted because one of the bidders withdrew at the last minute. </p> <p>None of the parties was prepared to comment on the appeal while the panel was deliberating. </p> <p>The battle for control of Hyder started at the end of March when the company was forced to admit that it was in bid talks. The group, which owns Welsh Water and the Swalec electricity distribution business, had just completed a review of its options after coming under strong institutional pressure for change. </p> <p>Its share price fell from \u00a310.41 in January 1998 to \u00a31.82 in March this year, not least because of regulatory price cuts which will lop \u00a370m off its profits.</p>",
  "President Vladimir Putin last night asserted his control over the Russian military, attacking 10 years of bungled attempts at reform and intervening in a bitter power struggle between Russia's two top defence officials. <p>At a crucial meeting in the Kremlin, the president demanded affordable restructuring of the Russian armed forces, presaging radical changes that could bring unilateral nuclear arms cuts and sharp manpower reductions. </p> <p>Last night's session represented Mr Putin's latest move in his mission to reshape Russia and entrench his own power. After reining in the regional barons who shared power with his predecessor Boris Yeltsin and tackling the over-mighty business oligarchs, Mr Putin read the riot act to the generals. </p> <p>The national security council, chaired by Mr Putin, heard calls for resources and funds to be redirected from the elite nuclear forces to beef up conventional arms spending. </p> <p>The session, intended to map out the key reforms for the next 15 years, was postponed from last month as the defence minister, Marshal Igor Sergeyev, and the hardline chief of the general staff, General Anatoly Kvashnin, waged an unusually public war of words. </p> <p>\"I've been quite patient with the polemics within the defence ministry,\" Mr Putin said, in a sharp rebuke to both men. </p> <p>He lambasted the shambolic state of the armed forces. \"The current structure of the armed forces is hardly optimal. How can it be considered optimal if training is not conducted in many units, pilots rarely fly and sailors rarely go to sea?\" </p> <p>Mr Putin recently sacked six generals associated with the defence minister, suggesting that Gen Kvashnin, one of the architects of the war in Chechnya, was winning the battle for influence. </p> <p>Gen Kvashnin and the general staff want Russia's land-based intercontinental nuclear missile force cut from 756 missiles to 148 by the year 2016, the size of the armed forces reduced by a quarter from 1.2m to 900,000, and the strategic rocket forces - the branch of the armed forces which controls Russia's land-based nuclear force - incorporated into the air force. </p> <p>Mr Sergeyev, a former rocket forces commander, dubbed the Kvashnin plans \"criminal stupidity\" and proposed instead that all Russia's land, sea, and air nuclear capacity be grouped in a new branch of the armed forces. That proposal has few backers. </p> <p>Mr Putin was expected to exploit the row to increase his control over the military through new appointments. </p> <p>Moscow has been rife with speculation that he could name a new civilian defence minister and fire both officials, though this is thought unlikely for the time being. The ambitious Gen Kvashnin also hopes to replace Mr Sergeyev as defence minister. </p> <p>The general staff argument is that Russia is not about to fight a nuclear war with the US. It is, however, at war with Chechnya, and ill-equipped to conduct such campaigns because 70% of new military procurement spending goes on nuclear capacity. The Kvashnin camp, with backing from younger analysts and security experts, argues that Russia must stop trying to compete with the US as a superpower. </p> <p>\"The Kvashnin argument is essentially that a nuclear war with the US is impossible and there's no sense in maintaining a strategic balance with it,\" the defence analyst, Alexander Goltz, said </p> <p>Mr Putin told the meeting that the structure of the armed forces had to mirror \"the threats Russia faces now and will face in the future\" and added that expensive arms build-ups had contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Russian defence budget, which Mr Putin was expected to agree to increase last night, is around \u00a33.2bn, contrasted with a US defence budget of almost \u00a3200bn. </p> <p>The Sergeyev camp, supported by influential members of the strategic and foreign policy elites, claims that the strategic rocket forces swallow only 17% of defence spending, that a nuclear arsenal enables Russia to punch above its weight internationally, and that it would be lunacy to surrender unilaterally what it could negotiate away bilaterally in arms talks with the US. </p> <p>\"This is a constant source of conflict because the roles of the defence minister and the chief of the general staff are not clearly defined,\" Andrei Kokoshin, a former security council chief and deputy defence minister, said. \"Only the president can the be the chief judge.\"</p>",
  "Sliding technology stocks and the disappearing wealth of e-commerce millionaires have been greeted by a mixture of shock and glee. There is little sympathy for the new super-rich, but questions are being asked about the medium-term economic implications of any slowdown. <p>Just over a century ago, another boom industry faced the same problems. Thousands poured their lives and money into it. Fortunes were created and lost as prices rocketed, then collapsed. There was no protection from raiders who could tap into production created by pioneers. Profits were rare and largely illusory. The industry - oil - went on to dominate the century. </p> <p>New industries created by entrepreneurs are always risky. The greatest illusion is that novelty is a substitute for efficiency. John D Rockefeller persuaded many rivals to sell to him or merge simply by showing them his accounts. These demonstrated that his technologies were better, his costs lower and his marketing superior. </p> <p>E-commerce failures are characterised by poor technologies, high costs and flimsy marketing. Anyone, like me, who spent hours trying to access the boo.com website knew it was doomed. </p> <p>Entrepreneurs can get so excited by their idea that they forget the realities of managing a business and the cruelty of the market. Internet start-ups were badly let down by venture capitalists and bankers, whose lack of objectivity and business acumen were cruelly exposed. </p> <p>One of the constants in business is the high rate of failure among new businesses. Eight out 10 cease trading within three years of starting. The most common reasons why they fail are under-capitalisation and poor management. Lack of capital is largely caused by the inability of many start-ups to plan and manage for the worst as well as the best case. Research by Michael Peel, reported in the International Small Business Journal, confirms that poor or careless financial management is endemic in small firms. Late payment legislation has helped some, but average debtor days for most types of enterprise exceed 45 days. </p> <p>The impact of weak finances is made worse by inadequate planning, poor operations management and weak marketing by people who fail to appreciate the dark side of the enterprise economy. </p> <p>Much of the appeal of small businesses to policymakers lies in the transfer of the costs and risks of failure from society to individuals. The failures of giant companies like BMW or massive projects like the Dome have a large-scale public impact that does not occur when thousands of small firms fail. </p> <p>The UK's ability to compete in the new economy will largely be determined by the ability of entrepreneurs to exploit the opportunities emerging from the knowledge economy. Despite this, little effort is invested in developing the management capabilities of entrepreneurs, especially those capable of creating high-growth companies. In the latest edition of the Harvard Business Re view, Andrew Hargadon and Robert Sutton describe some of the distinctive skills that are needed for successfulknowledge-based companies. </p> <p>Search skills are necessary to spot new markets and emerging technologies. The management of innovation tests every aspect of a firm's operations. Knowledge gatekeepers are important for transferring ideas that emerge outside the business into products that can be delivered profitably. These capabilities do not emerge spontaneously; they grow out of enterprise development focused on high-potential people and businesses. </p> <p>\u0095 Tom Cannon is visiting professor of business, Kingston Business School</p>",
  "There is a space crisis in the south-east - homeowners are being squeezed. But it's not the lack of land for new homes that is causing the problem, but the dearth of storage. <p>Estate agents FPD Savills blame the space shortage on our fervour for converting traditional storage space into living rooms. Fewer and fewer attics are doing the job they were designed for; they are now bedrooms, offices, spare rooms and extra bathrooms. </p> <p>According to Fiona O'Callaghan of FPD Savills research department, they find conversions cheaper than moving into a bigger property. \"But the knock-on effect is that people are literally running out of space.\" </p> <p>Increasingly, crowded households struggling to store granny's bureau and 150 easy-listening albums are turning to self-storage companies to help them solve their space problems. </p> <p>Self-storage is huge in America and is now making forays into the UK. The market has mushroomed in the past 12 months, particularly in London and the south- east, where two-thirds of the 110 storage centres owned by the eight market leaders are located, say FPD Savills. </p> <p>Containerised storage used to be the only alternative to the pile-it-high warehouses, but this, too, has its disadvantages, says Stephen Homer, sales and marketing director of self-storage company Big Yellow. \"Consumers using containerised storage usually have to telephone and make an appointment and wait a couple of days before the company retrieves their box,\" he explains. </p> <p>Containerised storage companies charge each time the doors of the warehouse are opened, up to \u00a350 plus VAT, says Mr Homer, with access available only during normal working hours. </p> <p>By contrast, new-style storage units claim to give the customer control over their goods. The attraction of self-storage is that the customer rents a self-contained unit. Companies offering the service say the units are clean, dry and lockable. The units offer customers free unlimited access - the customer holds the only key - and some are open for 24 hours. Security is round the clock, with the help of staff, alarms, CCTV, and swipecards. </p> <p>Nearly three-quarters of Big Yellow's customers are domestic. \"They are moving house, getting divorced, have suffered a bereavement, or have a new baby. For them, self-storage is like a room away from home,\" says Mr Homer. </p> <p>Philip Lewis, executive chairman of Safestore plc, half of whose customers are domestic, says demographic factors are driving demand. With fewer people getting married and more getting divorced, demand for flats has increased. </p> <p>In London self-storage is popular with flat-owners who need space for skis and bikes as well as for beds, tables and chairs, says Mr Homer. \"It's handy if you're moving house and the contracts haven't been exchanged at the same time. You can take your family to a hotel for a couple of weeks and still be able to get to your things.\" Students are another client group: \"They store term-time stuff in a 10 sq ft unit instead of getting their parents to come and take their stuff back for the holidays.\" </p> <p>So how much does it cost? Charges vary depending on where the units are sited. Safestore in Sheffield offers a 50 sq ft unit, big enough for the contents of a large one-bedroom flat, for \u00a346.15 plus VAT per month, a total of \u00a354.23. A 25 sq ft unit is available for \u00a323.10 plus VAT, \u00a327.14. In Croydon, Big Yellow has a 50sq ft unit for \u00a373.00 plus VAT per month. </p> <p>Customers should insure the contents of their unit, either independently or through the self-storage companies, many of which offer their own insurance. Safestore will cover goods for 75p per week per \u00a31,000 of contents insured. </p> <p>The British Association of Removers has tips for those seeking storage on its website, <a href=\"http://www.bar.co.uk.\" target=\"_NEW\">www.bar.co.uk.</a> Whoever you choose, the organisation urges consumers to visit the storage site to check security arrangements first hand. </p> <p>The self-storage business is booming and before long warehouses containing hundreds of little cupboards will be a familiar site in out of town shopping centres.

  "Few would dispute that the law governing the Child Support Agency is due for a substantial overhaul. But legislation passed last week may add to the difficulties that have beset the agency since it became the primary means of making absent parents support their children in 1993. <p>Its main use has been in cases where a mother would otherwise have had to live on state benefits. Only about one in ten applications to the agency are made by parents voluntarily, rather than at the behest of the DSS. </p> <p>The new law aims to increase the number of people outside the benefits system using the CSA. It tries to simplify the method of calculating benefit, which has caused tremendous problems. </p> <p>Now a fixed percentage of the income of the absent parent (usually the father) after tax and pension contributions will be payable to the mother at the rate of 15% for one child, 20% for two and 25% for three or more. In most cases this will reduce the burden on the father and may reduce the resentment felt by many targeted by the CSA. On the other hand, the father's housing costs will no longer be deducted when reckoning the income out of which he has to pay maintenance. </p> <p>This closes a loophole which has allowed a few men to live in extravagant properties, effectively at the expense of their children. The only way the father can now reduce the \"pot\" from which he has to pay that percentage is if he cohabits with a new partner and her children. That will reduce the amount he pays by at least 15%. </p> <p>No account, though, will now be taken of the mother's income. When she earns as much as the father, this can cause much resentment. </p> <p>Many fathers say that they do not begrudge the pay ments to their children, but believe that the money will be used by the mother to improve her own and, perhaps, her new partner's, lifestyles. </p> <p>Some feel so strongly about this that they attempt to give the money directly to young children, something as unlawful as it is absurd. </p> <p>The other big change is that it will no longer be open for parents in divorce proceedings to agree, even through a court order, that neither should apply to the CSA. This aspect has drawn particular criticisms from the Law Society's Family Law Committee. </p> <p>Mark Harper, of City solicitors Withers, a member of the committee, says: \"This goes against the culture of mediation and negotiation to resolve divorces and is an unacceptable limitation of the rights of parents to make private arrangements.\" </p> <p>The provision may prevent \"agreements\" being unfairly foisted on mothers, but the divorce courts have a duty to ensure financial agreements are fair. A carefully negotiated compromise can now be overturned by an application to the CSA. Where part of the divorce agreement involves the father paying regular maintenance to the mother, wily lawyers can stipulate that it is automatically adjusted by the same amount as any CSA assessment should there be an application. </p> <p>Where the divorce is a clean break, with only a one-off lump sum paid, a mother cannot be bound by any agreement she has made not to seek more money from the CSA. </p> <p>Mr Harper, like many specialists in the area, believes that the government will before long be forced back to the drawing board. Otherwise, he says, \"the system will face even greater problems than the chaos the CSA has caused so far\". </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister</p>",
  "Lech Walesa, the founding father of independent Poland was yesterday acquitted on charges of collaborating with communist era secret police after it emerged that key documents used against him in a Warsaw court were forgeries made by a special unit set up to discredit him. <p>Poland's best-known anti-communist activist and founder of the Solidarity movement faced two weeks of court hearings which critics branded a humiliation for Poland in the eyes of the world. </p> <p>Mr Walesa, 59, passionately maintained that police files which emerged earlier this year, indicating that he spied on fellow dissidents as agent Bolek, were forgeries. </p> <p>The prosecutor at the closed hearing, Krzysztof Kauba, called for the case to be stopped after newly discovered documents were presented to the court, indicating that the secret police established a special unit to discredit Walesa in the 1980s. </p> <p>An interior ministry report from 1985 outlined the use of forgers to produce documents making it appear Walesa was a paid agent. Some forged papers were sent to the Nobel committee in 1982 in an effort to stop him from winning its acclaimed peace prize. He received it a year later. </p> <p>Outside court, Mr Walesa said the case had been a waste of time and taxpayers' money. </p> <p>\"I'm not happy,\" he said. \"We have not progressed. Just as in the past, those who didn't be lieve don't believe, and those who did believe, believe.\" </p> <p>Before entering the courtroom for the final hearing, he had said: \"I was fighting the communists, and it was a life or death struggle.\" </p> <p>He said the hearings were part of a \"laughable, political vendetta against me by former enemies\", and he regretted the Polish secret services still had considerable clout. </p> <p>If found guilty, Mr Walesa, who steered Poland through the early years of democracy, faced being banned from holding public office for 10 years. He would also have been forbidden from voting. </p> <p>The ruling now clears the way for Mr Walesa, the country's first post-communist president, to run for president again in October's elections. </p> <p>The former Gdansk shipyard electrician is one of 18 candidates running for president in October. His supporters said the appearance of potentially incriminating documents at such a critical time was timed to upset his bid. </p> <p>Mr Walesa's acquittal comes just a day after the the country's incumbent president Aleksander Kwasniewski was cleared on similar charges. </p> <p>Mr Kwasniewski, to whom Mr Walesa lost the presidency five years ago and who is tipped to win October's election, has pledged to avenge the deeds of those he accuses of \"manipulating the evidence\" which brought him to court. His case was dropped after the prosecutor claimed there was a lack of evidence. </p> <p>Mr Walesa who was president from 1990 to 1995 enjoys little popular support these days, but is still seen affectionately as a symbol of the historic changes that ended the cold war. </p> <p>In an article in the latest edition of the current affairs magazine Wprost, Mr Walesa outlined his determination to clear his name. \"I decided to appear in court so that no one says I put myself above the law. This trial is against me, against my name and the most painful thing to me is that I'm put on the same weighing scales as president Kwasniewski. This proves how the history of the past 20 years is totally misunderstood.\" </p> <p>The trials of Mr Walesa and Mr Kwasniewski resulted from a law passed in 1997 which requires top officials, including presidential candidates, to declare past links to the secret police and forces the vetting of those applying for top posts. </p> <p>Critics say the recent cases prove the law is flawed, because accusations can be made on the basis of unsubstantiated evidence. </p> <p>It has also proved the Poles' painful struggle to come to terms with their past since the toppling of the communist regime in 1989. They will be forced to do a lot of uncomfortable soul-searching next year when former secret police files will be open to the public for the first time. </p> <p>Latest opinion polls show support among Poles for Mr Walesa's presidential candidature has risen by 1% over the last month to 4%. Mr Kwasniewski's support is 62%.</p>",
  "Uri Gordon, who has died aged 65, was Israel's leading immigration planner of the 1980s and 1990s. Tireless and inspirational, he settled hundreds of thousands of newcomers in a strange land, and argued that Israel's Law of Return for Jews was sacrosanct; no genuine applicant should be refused merely because he was unskilled. <p>Yet, ultimately, Gordon preferred genuinely motivated aliyah (immigration) to sheer weight of numbers. An early advocate of the mass migration of Soviet Jews, he later warned of \"national suicide\" if Israel continued to accept immigrants with no Jewish links. </p> <p>Gordon's upbringing exemplified the spirit that he wished to impart to more blas\u00e9 Israelis. He was born in Palestine, to Polish and Russian parents. Despite suffering from infantile paralysis, he became a youth leader in the working-class districts of Tel Aviv and learned the virtues of collective farming at Kibbutz Mishmar David, outside Jerusalem. </p> <p>By the late 1960s, he had founded the governing Labour party's Young Guard. In the early 1970s, he created clubs for young mizrakhim (Oriental Jews) in deprived development towns. The Zionist Federation then asked him to lead their new dor hemshekh (next generation) unit in 1974. </p> <p>Four years later in the United States, he set up Telem, a group that arranged courses and trips to Israel, and forums where American Jews could meet Israelis. Back home in 1981, he headed the government's youth immigration programme. Six years later, he became head of the Jewish Agency's immigration and absorption department. </p> <p>Immigration to Israel had fallen since the heyday of the early 1950s, but everything changed with Operation Solomon in 1991, when, in just 36 hours, 14,200 Ethiopian Jews were air-lifted from war-racked Addis Ababa. Suddenly, Gordon was responsible for feeding, housing and training people with no knowledge of westernised societies. Shrinking funds exacerbated his task. </p> <p>The Ethiopian influx to Israel was soon dwarfed by Soviet immigration, which accelerated with the crumbling of the eastern bloc in 1989, as more than 650,000 former Soviet citizens entered Israel in just six years. </p> <p>While Zionist orthodoxy deemed this a major triumph, several groups inside Israel were troubled. Mizrakhim resented the newcomers getting preferential treatment, just as they were poised to claim their own place in society. Older Israelis were amazed at some of the immigrants' ignorance and lack of patriotism. Palestinians were furious that even non-Jews were welcomed - a privilege they were denied, despite their historical links to the land. Many gentiles entered Israel legally as spouses of Jews, while others forged conversion documents. </p> <p>Gordon changed his opinion. By 1998, he was condemning laws that effectively forced Israel \"to open its gates and take in generation upon generation of non-Jews, a phenomenon that [will damage] the fabric of our future society.\" </p> <p>He certainly never shied away from controversy. In 1993, he asked Britain to refuse asylum to 100 Bosnian Jews, claiming that \"these Jews are not refugees; they have a home in Israel\". He favoured a Palestinian state, yet in 1996 appeared to endorse placing immigrants on West Bank settlements. </p> <p>In 1997, Gordon was elected president of Israel's Zionist Council. Undaunted by a recent stroke, he campaigned against the country's deepening schisms, trying to revive enthusiasm for the state's founding beliefs. </p> <p>Gordon was a tireless and inspirational man of action. He also raised profound questions about the land he loved. He is survived by his wife and three daughters </p> <p>\u0095 Uri Gordon, campaigner, civil servant and educationalist, born 1935; died July 30 2000</p>",
  "<p>Talks between NTT, the Japanese telephone company, and the US government continued yesterday amid signs that they may be ready to agree a framework for the ground-breaking acquisition of Verio, an internet hosting company. </p> <p>NTT's proposed $5.5bn acquisition of Verio has been stalled for the past month after the Federal Bureau of Investigation raised national security objections based on wire-tapping access and espionage fears. </p> <p>The government has often insisted on safeguards to protect national interests in foreign takeovers. However, the Verio deal represents the first time national security concerns have been raised over a cross-border internet merger. The committee on foreign investment is due to report to President Clinton on Monday on whether NTT has done enough to satisfy concerns. </p> <p>Reports yesterday suggested that NTT, which is 53% owned by the Japanese government, may have improved its chances by offering to set up a separate US subsidiary without the oversight of the foreign parent. Other concessions are understood to include a firewall to make it harder to listen to the FBI's calls, for example. </p> <p>Shares in Verio rose 3% yesterday morning amid relief that a deal was in sight. Any agreement is likely to provide a framework for other deals in the communications sector. US congressmen have raised objections to Deutsche Telekom's proposed $46.5bn acquisition of VoiceStream, a wireless phone operator, for similar reasons. </p> <p>The problem is compounded by the fact that several of the world's large telecommunications groups are largely owned by governments. This is the case for NTT and Deutsche Telekom, prompting at least one politican to argue that the US \"did not give up government control of the telephone service in order to hand it over to a foreign government\".</p>",
  "<p>For August it has been a pretty exciting week for City share dealers. Barclays' wooing of the Woolwich had the banking sector in a tizzy trying to spot the next target. The pharmaceuticals sector took a pounding. </p> <p>However, yesterday it was back to a more typical Friday in August. The FTSE-100 barely stirred, closing almost flat after a trading day where even the term lacklustre would be an exaggeration. Not even a 100-point surge from the Dow Jones on the back of the latest US economic data was enough to generate investor interest. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 closed down 2.8 points 6384.5. </p> <p>Analysts said there was no apparent pattern as the market wound down to a hot weekend, with only one or two stock-specific companies coming through. </p> <p>Shares in <strong> Corus Group</strong> , Europe's biggest steel-maker, dropped to a 20-month low as Salomon Smith Barney tried to place a 4.13% stake or 129m shares in the market, even though the stock has already fallen by 40% to 50% this year. </p> <p>The stock fell almost 6% in London to 77p with 155m shares changing hands. </p> <p>Corus' three main shareholders are US funds Franklin Resources, with 8.85%, and Brandies, with 7.5%, and Deutsche Bank with 4.7% </p> <p>The troubled steel-maker, which has had to cut jobs in recent months, blames its poor performance on the strong pound and weak euro. </p> <p>Plagued by threats of strikes and mounting costs investors fear the share price may have further to fall before the company turns itself around. </p> <p>Corus has underperformed the FTSE All Share index by 46% so far this year. </p> <p><strong> Barclays'</strong> share price continued its downward trend as investors tried to evaluate the agreed merger with the <strong> Woolwich</strong> . </p> <p>The shares fell a further 11p to \u00a315.70 yesterday, having already fallen over 6% since the announcement. However <strong> Abbey National</strong> shares climbed 20p to 775p as in vestors assessed the chances of its becoming the next bid target. </p> <p>While the acquisition will raise Barclays' stake in the mortgage lending market, it is still unclear if the synergies are sufficient to justify the price paid. </p> <p><strong> Vodafone</strong> led technology media and telecom stocks (TMT) lower against the flow of firm oil and drug shares. </p> <p>The company was down 5p to 270p, down 1.8%. </p> <p>Technology stock <strong> ARM</strong> <strong> Holdings</strong> , Europe's largest chip designer, was a big loser of the day, shedding more than 7% to 650p. </p> <p>Investors reassessed their forecasts for the company following American chip manufacturer Dell's lower than expected sales figures. </p> <p>Dell blamed the shortfall in sales on a drop off in European demand for microprocessors. </p> <p><strong> Bookham Technology</strong> was one of the biggest losers, yes terday falling by 8% to close at \u00a337.84. </p> <p><strong> QXL</strong> , the internet auction site, also continued to fall due to worries about a potential German acquisition.

  "Serbian soldiers made a probing incursion into Kosovo two weeks ago in the worst breach yet of the agreement that ended Nato's bombing campaign last year, the US forces newspaper, Stars and Stripes, said yesterday. <p>US forces scrambled Apache helicopters to confront the group of armed and uniformed Serbs in two all-terrain vehicles who retreated across the dividing line between Kosovo and the rest of Serbia, the paper said. </p> <p>The incident took place on July 28 in the mountains of eastern Kosovo, near Serbia's Presevo valley, where there have been clashes between Serbian police and a group of ethnic Albanians seeking independence from Belgrade. </p> <p>Shortly after the alleged incursion, peacekeepers said they had stepped up security in the Presevo area to try to stop the ethnic Albanian UCPMB group from operating. US forces had reported seeing mortar fire and other military activity. </p> <p>Officials of the US military contingent that patrols the area refused to respond to questions about the incident and Nato spokesman Major Craig Snow in Pristina said he could not confirm that Serbian forces had crossed into Kosovo. \"We've not been commenting on specific incidents,\" Maj Snow said. </p> <p>Serb army and police units pulled out of Kosovo in July last year as part of an agreement that ended Nato's 78-day bombing campaign of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. </p> <p>The Serb incursion, if confirmed, would be regarded by Nato as a test of its commitment to control the movement of UCPMB guerrillas who operate out of Kosovo and have been trying the patience of the Serb military in Presevo. <br><b>Reuters, Pristina</b> </p>",
  "<p>Every evening this week two stories about the environment have been juxtaposed on our television screens. One has to do with a surplus of water. In Assam, four weeks of rain, ahead of the monsoon season, have devastated huge areas, making some 5m people homeless. The other comes out of the American west, from Montana, and the states around it. Here the problem is the reverse: prolonged drought, with little immediate hope of alleviation. </p> <p>Fires are raging which cannot be quelled, only diverted. Some 20,000 people, including large contingents from the armed forces, are doing their best to manage this catastrophe; but they are losing. Some 70 major fires are ravaging states from Texas to California. Whole communities are being evacuated by families who fear they may never return. Unless the weather changes there is little hope of relief. </p> <p>What is happening in Assam is an unmitigated disaster. What is happening in the west of the USA, though wrecking the lives of thousands and imposing costs which may run into billions, has at least one mitigating circumstance. It may be forcing on Americans, from the highest levels of government downwards, a new sense of urgency about environmental threats which for years they have contrived to ignore. Scenes from the stricken subcontinent have played on their TV screens , as on ours, over and over again, along with the warnings of experts that until the world came to recognise their significance and acknowledge the threat of global warming, such disasters could only continue and increase. </p> <p>But Montana and its neighbours are not the other side of the world: they are part of the USA. And the freak conditions which have sparked these fires have been replicated this year all over the country. On the eastern seaboard, hot seasons have turned eerily cold; it has rained as if the law of averages had been suspended. This disruption of their climate is producing an equal and necessary disruption of the fatally complacent attitudes which Americans have continued to display towards looming environmental catastrophe, while other developed nations, Britain included, began to wake up to them. </p> <p>That change was detectable, even before this disaster, in the growing awareness and willingness of great industrial corporations to acknowledge that these problems are real. It is evident in the way that oil companies, which until recently behaved as if environmental disturbance had nothing to with them, have begun to refashion their images as providers of energy in its broadest and sometimes its greenest sense. The expensive new advertising campaign by BP and its new associates, Amoco, Arco and Castrol, is a case in point. Green is their chosen colour; minimising emissions of conventional fuels and a whole new emphasis on solar power, are their message. BP, they now want us to accept, stands for \"Beyond Petroleum\". </p> <p>All this will take a very long time to turn round. Only last month, Washington admitted that it could not meet the legally binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas agreed at Kyoto in 1998. Its only hope of meeting those targets was to purchase what amounts to the right to pollute from other less prosperous nations. At that time, the official message seemed much what it had been over the past decade. If sacrifices are needed, others must make them; however grave the implications, we do not intend to let them alter our life styles. This week, America's viewers, watching the flames over Montana, may have started to think again.</p>",
  "The UN security council has approved the creation of an international tribunal for Sierra Leone to try the captured rebel leader Foday Sankoh and others responsible for recent atrocities in the country. <p>But there is likely to be considerable disagreement on who besides Mr Sankoh should stand trial. </p> <p>The court is being set up at the urging of Britain and the US, which see it as a key element, along with a more robust UN peacekeeping force and direct military backing for the government, in defeating the Revolutionary United Front, which has more than once come close to seizing power. </p> <p>\"This is a good, firm step,\" the British UN ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock, said. </p> <p>The exact nature of the court is not yet decided, but it is likely to set a number of precedents. Unlike the Bosnian and Rwandan tribunals, it will probably sit in the country where the crimes were committed. </p> <p>It is likely that foreign and local judges will hear cases jointly, and that Mr Sankoh will be charged under both international and national law. This would let him be tried for crimes against humanity and for the diamond smuggling with which he has funded his war. </p> <p>A joint court will raise a number of difficulties, not least whether Mr Sankoh would be sentenced to death. Sierra Leone law retains the death penalty for murder. He was sentenced to hang two years ago, but reprieved by peace negotiations. International tribunals are restricted to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. </p> <p>But the biggest area of contention will be who goes on trial. There is little doubt that Mr Sankoh is the primary target, but he alone is not responsible for the many atrocities committed in Sierra Leone, nor is the RUF. </p> <p>Amnesty International and other human rights groups argue that the leaders of other groups, some now allied to the government, and members of the government's own forces, should also be tried. </p> <p>\"Although this judicial process would focus on the major perpetrators of human rights abuses, in order to end impunity, all human rights abuses should be investigated and accountability established. No single individual or party to the conflict should be singled out for prosecution to the exclusion of others,\" Amnesty said. </p> <p>It will be particularly difficult to decide whether to charge leaders of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, which once fought with the RUF but now sides with President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. </p> <p>Its soldiers committed numerous atrocities, including rape, murder and amputation, when they fought alongside the RUF to take over much of Freetown at the beginning of last year. But its leader, Johnny Paul Koroma, is a key government ally, and popular with many civilians. Any attempt to put him on trial could further destabilise the country. </p> <p>Moreover, part of the British strategy has been to try to separate Mr Sankoh from the RUF by persuading other RUF commanders to give up the fight and negotiate. They are hardly likely to do that if they fear arrest and trial. </p> <p>One option might be to prosecute only for atrocities committed since the July 1999 peace deal, which included an amnesty for all human rights abuses committed up to then. </p> <p>There is little doubt that abuses have continued. RUF soldiers have raped and murdered civilians since the fighting flared up again in May, and the rebels have continued to force children to fight. </p> <p>The UN said that 15 child soldiers abducted, drugged and thrown into battle by the rebels were among 2,500 refugees who fled to Guinea this week to escape the fighting around Sierra Leone's diamond mines and government bombing raids. At least two of them are girls.</p>",
  "<p>Showing tonight in a cinema near you is Bankruptcy, a horror story about inflated expectations and financial despair. The audience is not your average film-goer but worried investors in the troubled cinema sector. </p> <p>Over the past few days, two large cinema operators have announced they are in deep trouble. Carmike, the third largest operator in US, has applied for bankruptcy protection while Regal Cinemas, the world's biggest chain, announced that quarterly losses had almost quadrupled. </p> <p>Hicks Muse Tate and Furst, the venture capital group and one of the largest shareholders in Regal, has informed its investors it may write off its $500m investment in the chain. \"While we have previously valued our investment in Regal at cost, given the company's disappointing results, this situation is currently under review,\" it said. </p> <p>The fad for huge megaplexes boasting more than 20 screens coupled with a decline in demand has damaged the industry in the US. Since 1997, the number of screens has increased by about 22 per cent to 37,000, while attendance has grown by only about 3 per cent in the same period. Regal, which benefited from a cash injection when KKR and Hicks Muse became majority shareholders in 1998, is $1.8bn in debt after splurging out on new cinemas across the country. </p> <p>Regal built the new megaplexes mistakenly believing that American cinema-goers, bored with the sad old cinemas, would use the megaplexes as a sort of social club, with food and entertainment. Unfortunately industry executives found it difficult to part with some of the old cinema houses. The head of PricewaterhouseCoopers' media and entertainment section Saul Berman said:\"A movie theatre is a sunk cost. It's a little bit harder than the ordinary store in a mall to repurpose.\" Attendance is expected to fall about 10 per cent to some 529.5m people this year, according to the box office tracking company Exhibitor Relations. </p> <p>Analysts say that the declining figures partly reflect this year's relatively dull or formula movies. Mission Impossible and the Gladiator are still the summer's top two films after The Patriot and the Perfect Storm, which opened on US independence day, failed to live up to expectations. Scary Movie, a low-budget spoof, is currently beating more standard fare such as Nutty Professor II: The Klump Storm. </p> <p>Cinemas have been forced to raise prices in order to offset the cost of providing comfortable seating. Exhibitor Relations estimates that US cinemas will gross $2.78bn this summer, down 7 per cent from last year's record-breaking season in spite of the sharp decline in attendance. </p> <p>Mr Berman expects a \"shake-up\" of the industry over the next few years. Although the largest cinema chains control about half of the nation's screens, the industry remains fragmented. There is likely to be much greater consolidation as companies either pair up to cut costs or go out of business. </p> <p>Regal's turnaround plan is to add only two new theatres next year and to sell more than 115, some 25 per cent of its total of 426 theatres. It has hired management consultants to \"help with pricing, marketing and cost reduction\" according to Hicks Muse.</p>",
  "<p>So at last the Bank of Japan gets its name on the G7 scorecard. After threatening to put one in the back of the net since April despite fierce opposition from the government, the bank's policy board has, by an undisclosed majority, finally voted to increase the cost of borrowing from zero to 0.25%, the first upward move in 10 years. </p> <p>At the end of a week of bad tempered exchanges with ministers the bank's governor Masaru Hayami no doubt feels empowered to be back in the global interest rate game after 18 months of doing nothing. With his counterparts in the US, continental Europe and Britain all having tightened monetary policy several times since the beginning of the year, he must have felt left out. By moving yesterday, Mr Hayami has also, within the narrow confines of the domestic political debate, won an important victory over vote-hungry ministers. </p> <p>Considering that the law granting the Bank of Japan's independence is little more than two years old, the latter is not an unimportant consideration. However, there is a very real risk that the bank will ultimately be proved to have scored an own goal. While in the short term achieving his long-held philosophical ambition of ending the zero interest rate policy, Mr Hayami, who thinks it encourages moral hazard and hurts pensioners reliant on interest income, may have unwittingly hampered what is still a very fragile economic recovery and, in doing so, sowed the seeds of his and Japan's downfall. It is undoubtedly true that the outlook for the Japanese economy is improving. Capital expenditure is rising and so too is company profitability. But that is largely due to the buoyancy of global demand. The domestic economy, by contrast, is still connected to a life support system of government spending. </p> <p>Consumer spending remains subdued and the collapse last month of the Sogo department store group highlights the fact that the financial system is still riddled with bad debts. </p> <p>Both the direct and psychological impact of a rate rise before a self-sustaining recovery has taken hold could prove damaging. With inflation still in negative territory, there was simply no need to tighten monetary policy now. Far better to wait until the signs of recovery were visible. The International Monetary Fund was less than enthusiastic, too. Mr Hayami's unspoken aim was probably to spur the government's flagging efforts at badly needed economic reform. But with a mandate of maintaining price stability, that is none of his business. He may be riding high in his own opinion now, but if Mr Hayami is to convince everyone else of the wisdom of his judgment he must hope that Japan's economic performance sparkles from now on. </p> <p><strong> Bank watch </strong><br> </p> <p> While the debate rages over whether the Bank of Japan was right to raise interest rates equity investors will be looking at those central banks, the US, Britain and Europe, which change their borrowing costs rather more often than their counterpart in Tokyo. There is an argument that one factor weighing on investor sentiment is the worry that interest rates may not have peaked and that stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic will remain below their best until the issue is resolved. </p> <p>Yesterday provided some evidence in favour of the interest rate overhang argument. The latest US data was not seen as increasing the pressure on the Fed to tighten the monetary screw another notch. So the Dow Jones squeezed a three figure gain yesterday, managing to top the 11,000 level. The figures do not definitively end the debate, which will continue to rage too in Britain and mainland Europe for some time to come. Investors may have a while to wait yet before getting the green light for another break upwards. </p> <p><strong> Price of success </strong><br> </p> <p> Celtic's message to its fans yesterday was written in bold green letters: if you want success, you will have to pay for it. </p> <p>The club's warning that ticket prices will rise was a harsh reminder of the cost of competing at the highest level. Transfer fees of more than \u00a310m are becoming almost routine and supporters, ultimately, foot the bill. </p> <p>This is particularly the case when things go wrong - as they have at Celtic, where the team struggled last season under Kenny Dalglish and John Barnes. Having invested heavily in new players, the club crashed out of the Uefa Cup and failed to reap returns in prize money and television payments. The ultimate losers, both financially and otherwise, are the fans. </p> <p>The club has traditionally kept its prices well below the national average and it has been well rewarded - with the highest season ticket sales in Britain. However, that friendly policy looks dated, particularly if the management gets its way and takes the club into a European super-league.</p>",
  "<p>So-called stakeholder blight - savers holding off from buying personal pensions while they await the arrival of stakeholder schemes - has been blamed for a fall in British pension and investment sales announced by the insurance group Axa yesterday. </p> <p>Although total worldwide sales of life, pensions and savings products were up 13.8% in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 1999, the UK was one of the few places to see sales fall - by 7.3%. </p> <p>The French insurer, which took full control of Sun Life and Provincial Holdings three months ago, said that \"market expectations\" on the final regulations for stakeholder pensions \"have had a negative impact on retirement contracts\". </p> <p>Labour has been talking about the stakeholder pension - a new, low-cost, flexible type of personal pension - since it was in opposition. But it was only in late February this year that the Treasury finally confirmed all the details and rules for the product. </p> <p>Stakeholder pensions go on sale in April 2001 and will be aimed at low and middle income earners. </p> <p>People will be able to start a policy with payment of as little as \u00a320 and the maximum a company will be able to charge for managing the funds is 1%. </p> <p>Axa is not the first company to blame falling sales on uncertainty about the new regime's rules and a tendency for savers to wait and see how it works in practice. </p> <p>But some companies claim to have overcome the blight. CGNU announced last month that it saw new individual pensions business grow 31% in the first half of this year. </p> <p>Axa said worldwide revenue, including financial services and property insurance, rose 28.8% to \u20ac41bn (\u00a324.8bn) from \u20ac31.8bn a year earlier - broadly in line with analysts' expectations. </p> <p>Adjusted to reflect a comparable exchange rate and operating structure, sales rose 15.3%.</p>",
  "Today, nature lovers may like to look out for a strange and distinctive sub-species, making its first appearance of the year across the moors of northern England and Scotland: purple-nosed, red-cheeked, clad in tweed suit and leather brogues, and with an unusual, braying territorial song. Yes, today is the Glorious Twelfth, and the grouse shooters are back. Animal rightists may get agitated about blood sports, but frankly, as a serious ecological issue, grouse shooting is a non-starter. As long as the birds are profitable, they'll be safe. It is less profitable species that we should be fighting for: water voles, bluebell woods, almost all the downland butterflies. One species, however, is so ludicrously uneconomic, and as out of place in our efficient modern countryside as a blunderbuss or a scythe, that its extinction seems assured. I am talking, of course, about the rural working classes. <p>They are threatened with imminent extinction, but nobody, except the occasional loony-tune such as Prince Charles, gives a damn about them. They're not particularly cute and cuddly, they don't look good on telly, and they spend a good deal of time slaughtering small mammals. </p> <p>Country people are not, in the repulsive language of the advertising industry, \"sexy\". They do not have vast disposable incomes, they do not form highly vocal and PR-oriented pressure groups, and, shy and inarticulate in shapeless cloth caps and wellies, with mottled, weather-beaten faces, they are not exactly \"telegenic\". They'd need an awful lot of hype and spin to win support in the modern media-world, and the average unemployed tractor-driver's budget just doesn't stretch to hiring a Tim Bell. </p> <p>Now then, class: which area of Britain has the lowest average wage? You might assume it was some post-industrial wasteland on Merseyside, or Tyneside, or the Clyde. Some desolate rustbelt where the old heavy industries have died and the new information and technology industries have not yet been born. But no: it's Cornwall. </p> <p>Farming incomes have fallen 75% in the past two years. Anyone who repeats that old saw, \"You never see a poor farmer,\" just hasn't got out of town enough lately. Graham Bigwood, a Somerset dairy farmer, recently made headlines when he managed to sell 10 Hereford cross heifers for \u00a32.97, after tax and VAT. That's a whopping 29p per calf - less than a pint of milk. Three years ago he'd have got \u00a360 a calf. Bigwood describes himself as \"a working-class farmer\" - the backbone of the rural economy and what is left of our rural culture. And, as he says simply, \"We are going to disappear.\" Farmer Bigwood gets up at 3am and does between 80-100 hours a week. He earns approximately 75p an hour. </p> <p>In a few years' time, many of these people and their \"economically marginal\" farms - the small sheep farms of the wild and beautiful uplands of Cornwall and the Pennines, of the moorlands of Wales and the wide chalk downs of Wessex - will go the same way as the shipyards on the Clyde. Instead, what is replacing the traditional, farmer-and-labourer population of the countryside is. . . townies. And they are moving into the countryside at the astonishing rate of 1,700 every week. Almost half of all country-dwellers are now townies by birth. What the survey doesn't show is, equally, how many country people are moving on to the nearest urban council estate, divorced from their heartland. </p> <p>Townies are making the English village the preserve of the rich. The prettiest cottages with the loveliest gardens now go for \u00a3200,000, \u00a3300,000, or more. Their buyers are solicitors, chartered accountants, stockbrokers. As they move in, the people born and bred in the place where their grandparents and great-grandparents lived, are steadily squeezed out. The average country-dweller can't find \u00a3300,000. To earn that kind of money - yes, you may spot a certain cruel irony here - you have to work in the city. If not the City. </p> <p> B y an even crueller irony, once installed in Rose Cottage it is then the townies who are the most vociferous campaigners against any new, low-cost, and probably rather ugly housing in the village: squat, grey, pebble-dashed, and proudly boasting aluminium window-frames. Precisely the kind that the low-waged locals need to buy or rent. And so the English village - that ancient, 1,000-year-old, living, breathing organism inhabited by those who work on the land - is going the same way as the bluebell woods. </p> <p>Our countryside is going though profound, traumatic and sometimes tragic changes. And a certain type of country-dweller - the genuine type, one might say - is set to vanish. It is important to realise how recently this extinction has come upon us. It was within living memory that the countryside was still largely horse-pow ered. And sometime in the near future - perhaps 10 years, 20 at the most - there will be no tenant farmers, no smallholders, no \"real\" local people left in our countryside. The only farms will be vast, thousand-acre agribusinesses growing GM crops for the supermarkets. Wildlife will be confined to specially set aside \"nature reserves\" that you will need a permit to visit. And villages will look immaculate. </p> <p>Oh yes, make no mistake about that. There will be no collapsing sheds with rusting, corrugated-iron roofs, no rotting muck-heaps covered in black plastic and old tractor tyres, no cow- shit in the lanes as the animals go for milking. All that messy business of farming and livestock husbandry - birth, copulation and death - will be safely hidden way behind the polite facades of factory farming. Villages will be pristine. There will be no blood sports to disturb the peace of the neighbourhood, no pack of hounds in full cry across the fields, no boom of shotguns from the woods. No one will grow cabbages or keep chickens in their front gardens any more - such a disagreeable habit of those old country-folk - and dawn will not be shattered by the raucous crow of some farmyard cock. </p> <p>Everything will be pretty, orderly and clean. The only sounds in the early morning will be the chatter of breakfast television from open kitchen windows, and the swish of tyres on tarmac as all those executive cars bear their drivers serenely to work in an office in the nearby town. </p> <p>\u0095 Christopher Hart's first novel, The Harvest, is published by Faber at \u00a36.99. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Exquisite, erotic and submissive, Japan's geisha have long been seen as playthings: symbols of one of the world's most male-dominated societies. <p>But this image, presented by Arthur Golden's bestselling Memoirs of a Geisha, is being turned on its head by a new trend in the \"floating world\" of Tokyo and Kyoto. </p> <p>Confirming the transformation taking place in relations between the sexes in Japan, the geisha have started pitching their business towards a powerful new group of consumers: women. </p> <p>Thanks to the recession and the changing tastes of salarymen, who prefer singing karaoke in a hostess bar to listening to a shamisen (a three-stringed musical instrument) in a tea house, the geisha's traditional source of income has been steadily falling. </p> <p>So for the first time in their centuries-long history, some traditional restaurants have begun using the geisha to attract all-female parties. </p> <p>\"It is a revolutionary change in our world,\" said Shichiko Sakuragawa, a hokan (go-between) at such parties. \"We can no longer survive by relying only on male patronage. We must build up business among women. Wives, after all, control the family purse-strings in Japan, so they have more money than their husbands.\" </p> <p>The change is already being felt in Mukojima, an entertainment district in north-east Tokyo, where kimono-clad geisha can often be seen clip-clopping in their wooden sandals to engagements at tea-houses and high-class ryotei (traditional) restaurants. </p> <p>Locals say the number of customers has been falling for 10 years and the geisha population has shrunk by 20%. </p> <p>But business remains strong at Meigetsu, an elegant restaurant with intimate tatami (mat) rooms and a garden of bamboo and pine, where one in 10 parties is for women only. </p> <p>\"They are mostly middle-aged ladies who love seeing young girls in kimonos playing traditional instruments,\" its owner, Keiko Akiyama, said. </p> <p>\"It's a sign that women are becoming stronger, but I cannot help feeling sad for men that this has happened.\" </p> <p>Women customers are increasing not only because they have more money and freedom, but because the geisha world has become less about sex and more about sophistication. </p> <p>Golden's book depicts the pre-war era when hard-up families sold their daughters to geisha houses, where they earned a living entertaining male clients with songs and, sometimes, sex. </p> <p>The virginity of many young geisha was auctioned off to the highest bidder. </p> <p>Ms Akiyama insists that such practices have long been a thing of the past. </p> <p>\"Golden's book creates a completely misleading impression,\" she said. </p> <p>\"Japan is now a rich country and young women are economically independent. Those who choose to become geisha do so because they like the traditional arts. There is nothing seedy about this world.\" </p> <p>On the contrary, the danger some fear is that the arrival of women customers may signal that the geisha world is losing its sensuality and becoming more like a museum attraction. </p> <p>\"Female customers are welcome, but I hope they do not overtake men,\" Shichiko Sakuragawa said. </p> <p>\"No matter how much business all-women parties generate, it would be terrible if we lost the thrill and the edge that comes from having a mix of men and beautiful women.\"</p>",
  "You can taste the mood among the spice stalls of the Bakara Market and hear it over the hum of the air-conditioning in the businessman's office. You can feel it in the cellblock of the Islamic court and you can smell it in the stench of the refugee camps. <p>With one voice the people of Somalia are calling for an end to war and a return to government. They want the killing to stop and they want the militiamen off the street. </p> <p>\"The time is right,\" Ahmed Adan, a businessman, said. \"After a decade of hate and division we are tired of war. We want to put an end to this nightmare.\" </p> <p>So when thousands of Somali's took to the streets of Mogadishu last week to express their support for the peace conference in neighbouring Djibouti, it was a demonstration of collective relief that the nightmare might soon be coming to an end. </p> <p>The Djibouti talks appear to be on track to create a government, but public relief may not be enough to see any agreement through. </p> <p>All 12 previous attempts at putting back together the pieces of Somalia have failed, and it will take more than the optimism of Somali people to make the 13th the lucky one. </p> <p>Although the opposing power groups all want to see a government established, they want it for different reasons. </p> <p>Businessmen want a laissez-faire government that will allow business to prosper. Religious leaders seek an Islamic government and the imposition of sharia law. Refugees want a government that will provide water, food and basic services. The young militiaman just wants to be able to go to school. </p> <p>When Marxist dictator Siad Barre fled the country in 1991, Somalia fell into the hands of warring clan-based militias fighting one another to fill the political void. </p> <p>Somalia's cities were reduced to rubble and millions of people were driven from their homes. Millions more were killed or died of famine. The UN, backed by the US, tried to intervene and restore order, but it failed and withdrew in 1994. </p> <p>Sheikh Hassan Dahir, sitting quietly behind his mahogany desk while his minions bustled around him, said: \"We support the Djibouti conference 100%. People need order and discipline in their lives.\" </p> <p>He said that he would support a secular government, but remained certain that the Islamic courts which he set up would keep their power under a new government. </p> <p>But according to the faction leader Hussein Aidid this is the last thing Somalia needs. </p> <p>\"Of course I support a government, but it must exclude the Islamic courts,\" he said. \"They are financed by the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.\" </p> <p>He fancies a government with himself at the helm, as do the other warlords whose militias have destroyed this once beautiful city. </p> <p>But nobody is paying much attention to the warlords these days. Mr Aidid and his supporters are clinging to a lost ideal, reluctant to accept that the tide of Somali politics has turned against him and the other warlords of Mogadishu. </p> <p>Mr Adan and his business partners returned from exile in Canada last year. They gave up comfortable lives and well-paid jobs and have invested more than a million dollars in Somalia's first independent television and radio station. </p> <p>\"We felt the time was right to come back and invest in the future of Mogadishu,\" Mr Adan said. </p> <p>\"Somali's are tired of war and everybody wants peace.\" </p> <p>But every now and then the conversation drops off in the face of a fierce gun battle which is taking place on the street just outside their offices - a timely reminder that it is too soon to write off what remains of the warlords' power and, more importantly, their arsenals of weapons. </p> <p>Around the time that Mr Adan returned from Canada, Abdi Sabrie was putting the finishing touches to a pasta factory he had built in Mogadishu's old industrial area. </p> <p>Mr Sabrie has grown rich from the absence of bureaucracy but is tired of having to pay protection money for his security, tired of having to generate his own electricity and find his own water. </p> <p>Even the militiamen now say they want to see the restoration of government. </p> <p>Mohamed Farah sat slumped in the tattered armchair with a Kalashnikov rifle, safety off, lying across his knees. Nicknamed \"Five Bullets\" for the number of times he's been shot, he monotonously chewed the tight bundle of khat stuffed inside his cheek. </p> <p>\"I don't want to fight anymore,\" he said. \"I'd rather go to school.\" </p> <p>But for the vast majority of Somali's there are no ifs or buts, us or them. They have nothing to lose and any form of government would suit them. </p> <p>Spread right across Mogadishu wherever the space will allow, makeshift refugee camps have sprung up, comprising thousands of dome shaped huts hastily erected with just a few feet separating one from the next. </p> <p>Fadumo Abdukadir has lived with her eight children in one such camp for the last eight years. </p> <p>\"Take a look around you,\" she said pointing towards the poverty of her surroundings. </p> <p>\"We have no food, no medicine and no hope. We don't care what kind of government we get. We just want help.\"</p>",
  "<p>A French judge yesterday avoided making a ruling on freedom of speech on the internet, instead ordering experts to see if it was possible to bar French surfers from accessing online sales of Nazi memorabilia on the site of US based web portal Yahoo. </p> <p>Three human rights groups in Paris launched proceedings against Yahoo in April, saying it was breaking French law by hosting internet auctions of Nazi paraphernalia including SS daggers, swastikas, propaganda films, photographs of death camp victims and replicas of Zyklon B gas canisters. </p> <p>The case raises the question of whether one country should have the authority to regulate the content of web sites in another country. </p> <p>Industry observers suggest the issue should be addressed at government level and not incourt. </p> <p>In France, it is illegal to sell or exhibit anything that incites racial hatred. In a ruling in May judge Jean-Jacques Gomez said Yahoo had offended against the country's \"collective memory\". </p> <p>Saying the US pages in question \"constituted an apology for nazism and a contestation of Nazi crimes\", he ordered the company to block French users from them. </p> <p>Yahoo argues that this is technically impossible, but the judge ruled yesterday that over the next two months a team of French, American and European experts should look for a way to identify web users by origin, and filter French users from the site. </p> <p>The experts will present their findings on November 6. </p> <p>The judge rejected demands by the three anti-racist and Jewish organisations bringing the case, LICRA, UEJF and MRAP, that Yahoo be fined more than \u00a3100,000 for each day that the auction pages remained open to French surfers. </p> <p>He also rejected one of Yahoo's main claims: that the US-based site was outside the jurisdiction of the French court. </p> <p>Yahoo's lawyer, Christophe Pecnard, welcomed the decision to appoint international experts. </p> <p>\"We will cooperate with the experts in order to see if any solution is possible,\" he said. </p> <p>But Marc Knobel, leader of the LICRA campaign, was angered by the decision. </p> <p>\"Technical solutions do exist,\" he said. \"These web pages are an offence to anyone who has lived through nazism. </p> <p>\"There are moral questions here - what kind of internet do we want? </p> <p>\"France, with all its history, rejects nazism and fascism and will continue to reject it.\" </p> <p>Yahoo said that it had never allowed auctions of Nazi memorabilia to take place on its French portal, Yahoo.fr. </p> <p>It added that it had taken the step of adding warnings, in French, to some pages of the site containing sensitive material, that alerted users that they risked breaking French law by viewing them. </p> <p>Although Yahoo's French-language portal does not grant direct access to the Nazi web auctions, the US pages can be accessed with a few clicks of the mouse. </p> <p>The pages are protected in the US under the constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech.</p>",
  "Campaigners for ramblers' rights today stepped up the pressure on the government not to abandon the countryside bill with a poll showing that eight out of 10 people support the legislation. <p>The Ramblers' Association published an NOP poll showing that 82% of those questioned believe the government should ensure the countryside bill, which is designed to protect threatened wildlife and the rights of ramblers, becomes law as soon as possible. </p> <p>The poll of 1,000 people follows reports last week that senior ministers are considering moves to abandon the legislation because of the massive backlog of bills which must be cleared through the Lords in this parliamentary session. </p> <p>Environmentalists fear the countryside bill, which has had more than 300 amendments from Tory peers to restrict access to their land, will be sacrificed to enable other important bills - on election spending, freedom of information, policing in Northern Ireland, criminal justice and transport - to be completed. </p> <p>But Kate Ashbrook, who has led the Ramblers' Association's right to roam campaign, said: \"The British public has consistently supported the government's election pledge to increase environmental protection and introduce a freedom to roam. It would be a tragedy if the government let this legislation fall by the wayside.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Wildlife and Countryside Link, an environmental umbrella group including Friends of the Earth and the National Trust, promised to \"fight to the last hedgerow\" to get the bill passed. </p> <p>And Labour MP Gordon Prentice said it was \"inconceivable that such a popular bill could be lost\" because of a lack of parliamentary time. </p> <p>The bill has the strong backing of both the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the environment minister, Michael Meacher. But the pressure on the legislative timetable means that it will be difficult to steer through more than five major bills still in the upper house before the start of the next parliamentary session. </p> <p>Ministers have ensured that detailed consideration of the legislation is timetabled for early October, in the middle of the party conference season, to increase the political pressure on the Lords not to go against the public mood. </p> <p>Tory peers, backed by the Countryside Alliance, have tabled numerous amendments to restrict the land available to ramblers, and prevent night-time rambling.

  "It took a while to realise that the answer was curved, smooth, shiny and encasing my head. Other heads too, tens of thousands of them, all stuck inside metal containers which give Monkee haircuts. <p>Motorcycle helmets are hot, uncomfortable, and a pain to carry around, and they are everywhere: on bankers, teenagers and tourists; on bar stools, cafe tables and desks; above all, they are on Roman minds. </p> <p>Most do not want to wear them. They want wind in the hair and absence of hassle, which they had until a law in March made helmets compulsory. Too many people were dying (1,185 nationally in 1998) and the government said 'enough'. Those caught without would be fined \u00a380. </p> <p>Overnight the city was transformed. Scooter and motorbike riders looked blocky instead of zippy. No longer, though God knows some tried, could they use mobiles. Eating an ice cream became fraught. </p> <p>Politicians, footballers and pop stars posed with helmets, but it was little consolation to teenagers who pulled up at discos with gelled tresses turned into bowlers. Businessmen complained that they looked silly carrying helmets into meetings. </p> <p>The whingeing has not stopped, if anything it is louder now, because of the heat. But an astonishing fact remains: unlike the widely flouted seat-belt law, this one is being obeyed. Except for a few tearaways at 3am, everyone wears a helmet. </p> <p>In a city where rules are supposedly made for bending, it is a miracle of law enforcement. Contrary to expectations, the police are vigilant, and contrary to cliche, the natives are acquiescent. </p> <p>Therein lies the answer, or part of the answer, to a complex question: does the south of Italy begin after Rome, or in Rome? </p> <p>Ask a Milanese and he will boot the capital deep into the backward south, the mezzogiorno, where his taxes are pocketed by layabouts and incompetents with no respect for order. Ask a Calabrian and he will place Rome far into the industrial north, where automata follow edicts from the state. </p> <p>By complying Rome has bolted itself to the north, distancing itself from the bare heads that remain the norm in Naples, Palermo and Reggio di Calabria. </p> <p>It is a significant breach. Newspapers and cabinet ministers have declared the helmet law evidence of Italian maturity and discipline, a respect for law and common sense befitting modern Europeans. </p> <p>There is a catch. Rather than endure a helmet, the mature, disciplined, sensible and modern Europeans of Rome are using more cars and taxis, worsening the already nightmare congestion. </p> <p>Those who stay on two wheels abandon their 50cc Piaggios for maxi-scooters with roofs and 500cc engines. </p> <p>Now that you have to wear a helmet you may as well be able to exceed 80mph, goes the logic.

  "In the bookshops of Corsica there is a work you cannot buy for love nor money. Settling Our Accounts, a muckraking volume of interviews with two leading nationalists, sold out last Monday afternoon, hours after one of its authors died in a hail of machine-gun bullets over his morning coffee. <p>Since bloody feuds between rival political factions and mafia gangs in France's most turbulent province can push the number of assassinations there to more than 30 a year, the murder of Jean-Michel Rossi and his bodyguard would ordinarily have shocked no one. </p> <p>But as France, one of Europe's last great centralised powers, edges towards acceptance of the idea that a little more autonomy - not only for Corsica, but for a few other regions - might be no bad thing, these killings could have wider repercussions. </p> <p>Last month, the Corsican assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of a groundbreaking package of devolutionary measures, known as the Matignon accords, drawn up by France's prime minister, Lionel Jospin. </p> <p>The measures offer the island's elected representatives regulatory powers by 2002 and, after a change to the French constitution by a future French government, formal, though limited, legislative powers by 2004. </p> <p>Last week's dual murder may have dealt a serious blow to the Matignon accords, founded on one condition: agreement between warring nationalist clans to end the bombings and machine-gunnings that have been an all but daily occurrence on the island for the past 25 years. </p> <p>\"Now we don't know where we are any more,\" said Lucien Pieri, a lawyer in the former Corsican capital of Corte. \"After Matignon, everyone thought we'd turned a page, that we had a workable future to look forward to. Now there could be a whole new cycle of violence.\" </p> <p>If the Corsican accords go ahead in spite of the killings - which they could do if Rossi's murder was inspired not by political differences but by his blowing the lid on Corsica's gangster nationalists - then other regions demanding greater autonomy could become impatient. </p> <p>\"Does it really take guns and bombs to make yourself heard?\" demanded Renaud d'Elissagaray, a leading conservative politician in the French Basque country, where peaceful demands for greater autonomy - a separate d\u00e9partement - are supported by some 80% of the population. </p> <p>\"We have a legitimate demand for greater self-rule and the recognition of our language, with massive popular backing, and so far it's been refused. The Corsicans get a deal after years of violence. Is it any wonder we're bitter?\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Abertzale Batasuna, the French Basque region's main nationalist grouping, said: \"So far we have steered clear of the bombings-prison-deaths cycle of [the] Spanish Basque country and Corsica. But there may soon come a day when we have to choose other means to make our point.\" </p> <p>Brittany, too, has ambitions for greater autonomy, and a small organisation - the Breton Revolutionary Army - that has not hesitated to carry out some 250 largely harmless attacks on symbols of the French state such as town halls, tax offices, police stations and customs buildings over the past few years. Earlier this year, one of its bombs killed a young McDonald's employee. </p> <p>\"When the French constitution recognises the existence of the Breton people, the integrity of our territory, the Breton language, then conditions for real democratic debate will be in place,\" the group said recently in the Basque separatist newspaper Gara. \"Armed struggle seems to us to be the best means to obtain those conditions.\" </p> <p>But all that most French regions - including French Catalonia, Alsace and Langue doc - want is a degree of administrative competence, such as their own d\u00e9partement , a greater recognition by Paris of their specific cultures, and the right to teach and use their ancestral languages. </p> <p>\"We want Nantes back, our traditional capital, and we want our cultural identity fostered through things like bi-lingual state schools,\" said Jean-Yves Cozan, a Breton heavyweight. \"We don't want what Corsica's got - Corsica is unique, it has different problems and different demands. But Paris needs to be more flexible.\" </p> <p>Republicans of left and right, who were horrified by Scottish and Welsh devolution, fear that any more constitutional \"flexibility\" along the lines of the Matignon accords could herald the end of the Gallic ideal of the indivisible republic, and of Charles de Gaulle's vision of \"a strong state and a people rallied in unity\". </p> <p>But there are signs that even conservative opinion is changing. Alain Madelin, the head of the Liberal Democracy party, argued last week that while the murder of Mr Rossi might cast some doubts on the workability of the Matignon accords, it should not turn France against regionalism. </p> <p>\"It is the problem of France's regions that creates the Corsican problem, not the other way round,\" he said. \"A Corsican compromise would help wreck Jacobin-Bonapartist France, but what we really need now is a regional policy for the whole country. French democracy needs a good airing.\"</p>",
  "Police hunting for a gun-obsessed rapist who jumped bail while a jury was considering its verdict yesterday switched their search to holiday resorts in mainland Europe, believing him to be on the Costa del Sol or possibly Tenerife. <p>The move follows confirmation that Trevor Masters' blue Land Rover was seen travelling through the Channel Tunnel on Tuesday morning, as he was due back in Cardiff crown court. </p> <p>Masters' escape, the day before he received nine convictions for sex attacks against women and two girls as young as 10, prompted criticism of the judge for granting bail to a man described as \"physically and sexually brutal\". </p> <p>John Griffith Williams, QC, a crown court judge on the Wales and Chester circuit, took the rare step of defending his decision. He said he had bailed Masters, 48, because the prosecution had not argued against it, and he was tied by the law. </p> <p>The statement was issued following fierce criticism by the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe. He said: \"It should be understood that any judge's powers regarding bail are circumscribed by the provisions of the Bail Act. </p> <p>\"The defendant had complied properly with his bail conditions, both before and during the trial. </p> <p>\"There were no representations made by the prosecution and there were no grounds in this case for withholding bail.\" </p> <p>Miss Widdecombe had said that \"given the nature of the crimes and the evidence which has led to convict the individ ual in question, the judge has some serious explaining to do\". </p> <p>Masters left his guest house in Cardiff on Monday night. </p> <p>Miss Widdecombe had said the case raised grave concerns and claimed there was a presumption in law that those charged with rape and serious sexual offences should be bailed only in exceptional circumstances. </p> <p>But yesterday the Home Office stressed that the 1976 Bail Act established a presumption in favour of bail, reflecting the principle that a person was innocent until proven guilty. </p> <p>Exceptions could be made only if the court believed the defendant represented a \"bail risk\" - being unlikely to return to court, for example, or to intimidate a witness - or was likely to reoffend. </p> <p>Even in rape and murder cases bail had been granted, with Sion Jenkins gaining bail as he waited trial for killing his foster daughter, Billie-Jo Jenkins. </p> <p>The crown prosecution service said it had offered no opposition to Masters being granted bail because he had complied with all the conditions set out at a full bail hearing in December. </p> <p>He had promised to stay in one place, not interfere with witnesses, not enter Scotland and Wales, and report to Ludlow police station twice a week. </p> <p>\"All the time he was on bail he never failed to comply with these conditions so, when he came to crown court, there was no reason for us to make representations,\" said Julie Seddon, a CPS spokeswoman. </p> <p>But she added that the prosecution had initially applied for him to be held in custody, which Newport magistrates had refused.</p>",
  "Almost 100 years after it was declared extinct in central Italy, the lynx is believed to have returned. At least eight of the world's most endangered cats are roaming the rugged Apennine mountains, according to Franco Tassi, superintendent of the Abruzzo national park. <p>Famed for elusiveness as well as ferocity, the lynxes have been detected from paw prints, tufts of hair, excrement and calls. </p> <p>Confirmation of their presence would represent another milestone in Italy's blossoming wildlife protection efforts, which have revived wolf, bear, chamois and deer. </p> <p>\"The presence of the lynx has been widely demonstrated and cannot be seriously disputed,\" said Mr Tassi, who has spent 30 years gathering the evidence. </p> <p>There are probably other groups living in southern Italy but there have been no confirmed sightings, which is not surprising, Gianluca Catullo of the WWF said. \"Lynxes are extremely shy, it's virtually impossible to spot them, so in the absence of scientific proof all we can do is look for signs and guess their number.\" </p> <p>Used by Dante to symbolise luxury, lynxes resemble oversized domestic cats and hunt at night, sticking to the undergrowth to avoid detection. </p> <p>They could have travelled to central Italy from the Alps. But Mr Tassi suspects that they never became extinct, merely more elusive as man encroached on their territory. </p> <p>\"The lynx has been rediscovered only in the last few decades because their numbers and those of their prey have increased due to better wildlife protection,\" he said. </p> <p>Two other species brought back from the verge of extinction are the golden jackal, spotted in the mountains bordering Slovenia, and the brown bear, which disappeared in Italy in 1908. </p> <p>A 1976 protection law is credited with quadrupling the number of wolves in the Apennines to 400, the fastest recovery rate in Europe and enough for them to start recolonising the Alps and extending into other countries. </p> <p>Unlike the wolves in Bulgaria, Russia and Romania, the Italian wolf has not interbred with feral dogs and remains pure, the Italian institute of wildlife biology says. </p> <p>Rare species of dolphin have been sighted in sanctuaries off Sardinia, Sicily and Tuscany. And after decades of absence blamed on pollution, whales are thought to be returning to waters off Naples.</p>",
  "<p>Greenpeace has challenged the government over the legality of the latest batch of farm trials of genetically modified crops saying that planning permission is required for the trials since they are technically scientific research and in law this is a change of use from farming. </p> <p>Greenpeace says the planting of this winter's batch of 15 GM oil seed rape trials would be unlawful unless planning permission is sought from the local authorities in each case. John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, and Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, have been told by letter that they have 14 days to reply or risk court action. </p> <p>Greenpeace has asked the government to confirm that it will cease all preparations for the farm scale trials of GM winter oil seed rape, at least until proper planning permission has been obtained. </p> <p>The Greenpeace case has arisen out of a judgment in 1965 when Judge Carey Evans held that if land was used for growing crops for research purposes it was not an agricultural use and planning permission was needed. The Department of the Environment takes comfort from the fact that West Dorset district council has considered the legal issue because of crop trials in their area at Over Compton. Councillors came to the conclusion that planning permission was not necessary. </p> <p>However, officially yesterday the government was not com menting on whether planning permission was necessary. It said each council must make its own decision. The secretary of state was not prepared to comment on a case that might come before the courts. </p> <p>In a written answer to a parliamentary question, Lord Whitty, an environment minister in the Lords, said on July 26 that the government was unable to give an authoritative interpretation of the legislation, adding that it was a matter for the courts. </p> <p>The case which may become central to the issue was brought by Dow Agrochemicals Ltd against a tenant farmer in Norfolk in 1965. Judge Carey Evans concluded that: \"Where nothing whatsoever is grown for use by man or beast, nor for use on the land to improve it or manure it, nor for sale, it is impossible to say the fact that crops along with weeds and grasses are grown for purely research purposes is enough to make the use of the land in question agricultural.\" </p> <p>Greenpeace campaigner Jim Thomas said: \"The decision to ignore the planning law demonstrates the government's breathtaking arrogance. They are already ignoring the rejection of GM technology by citizens and consumers - as well as the risk of genetic contamination.\" </p> <p>If Greenpeace continues with its action, it will coincide with the trial of its executive director, Peter Melchett, and 16 volunteers on charges of criminal damage for destroying GM trial crops due to begin in September.</p>",
  "The British Library's newly disclosed policy of discarding rare books was attacked yesterday as jeopardising its reputation as \"the most important cultural institution in the country\". <p>The policy - which was unknown to at least one member of the library's governing board - means that it is losing its historic purpose as a library of last resort, according to Brian Lake, secretary of the BL regular readers' group. </p> <p>\"I cannot believe that it is getting rid of the last copies of books,\" Mr Lake said. \"I have never heard of anything like this. The library has a responsibility for the nation's printed history, for everything involved with the printed word. If a book is not available any where else, it should be in the BL. If it is not there, it may be lost to all British access.\" </p> <p>The BL's role as a copyright library, to which publishers are obliged by law to give all books, dates back to 1662. Its worldwide reputation as a library of last resort, storing unique copies for scholars, developed in the 19th century. </p> <p>Yesterday, however, it confirmed to the Guardian that it has discarded at least 70,000-80,000 books since 1990 without announcing the policy for public discussion or debate. According to one estimate covering its wider stock, the total could run into hundreds of thousands. </p> <p>The thrown-out volumes, many from the library's main reference collection, included what are called \"last copy discards\". This means that they were officially known to be the only copies in any library in Britain and possibly in the world. </p> <p>As the Guardian reported, the weeding of last copies was confirmed in a letter to a complaining scholar by Richard Cheffins, head of BL's social policy information service. </p> <p>Mr Cheffins, a respected scholar in the field, had no part in the weeding, which was carried out by junior grade staff. It continued for two years during the 1990s and was temporarily suspended because of a staff shortage but is still \"an ongoing process\", according to a BL spokesman. </p> <p>Yesterday the BL did not respond to a request for a comment from its chief executive, Lynne Brindley. </p> <p>Mr Lake, whose 600-strong readers' group was consulted by BL in its recent move from Bloomsbury to St Pancras, London, said he had heard no inkling of the policy. </p> <p>\"Mr Cheffins has been brave to write about it. What has gone wrong with BL is that it lacks any vision. It has been reduced to mission statements. </p> <p>\"It has not been given enough money and its policies are all about fitting everything into the financial pot it is given. But this is only part of a process happening to public libraries all over the country.\" </p> <p>Mr Lake added that he would ask for a meeting with Ms Brindley on the weeding. </p> <p>A source with recent experience of governors' meetings said yesterday: \"I have not heard of this before. I shall be surprised and perturbed if it is true\".</p>",
  "Valerie Toovey is 55 and has 22 grandchildren. Her glass cabinet is filled with pictures of them all and her shelves are lined with hundreds of ornaments they have given her. <p>There are almost always some of the grandchildren here, rolling over the armchairs, pulling out the china. Today, there are some of them in the front garden of the terrace house that lies at the back of the Paulsgrove estate, in north Portsmouth. Cavorting about, they are shouting about \"pervs\". One, Fred, covered in facepaint, shouts through the door about his mum, Sharon: \"She's my mother, the mega bitch.\" Sharon laughs. </p> <p>For the past few nights, Valerie, her daughter Sharon, Sue, who is Valerie's ex-daughter-in-law, and all the kids have been protesting against paedophiles on the estate. </p> <p>Together with other placard-waving mothers and grandmothers, they have marched up to the houses of people they believe are child abusers and begun shouting and chanting outside their doors. But they are having a night off tonight, while discussions with the council take place on how the situation can be resolved. </p> <p>Valerie is sitting on her neat floral sofa with Sharon, Sue, 40, Sharon's son, Jimmy Toovey, 15, and Patsy Lander, 11, a friend's daughter. Crawling around in a pale blue babygro is 17-month-old Ernie Toovey. </p> <p>The women are talking about the protests and trying to explain why they have been joining in. </p> <p>\"We have had two perverts living up this road. We are not just going on hearsay, the two here we know definitely,\" says Valerie. \"Then there's another one - we used to see him in the butcher shop with his little dog and we would never have dreamt he was a pervert. Until it went in the paper we didn't know that he was.\" </p> <p>The women say that the two abusers they know of very locally were both in-family abusers. In spite of this, they believe that they present a threat to their children. </p> <p>\"It's a chance you cannot afford to take when it's a child of your own,\" says Sharon. \"They are all as bad as each other.\" </p> <p>Here in Paulsgrove, a modern-day Salem, there are no greys when it comes to the delicate matter of the paedophile. There is no distinction between the mild offender and the serious one - everything is black and white. </p> <p>\"To me they are all the same. They have all done it,\" says Valerie, large gold earrings rattling as she furiously shakes her tightly-permed head. \"If any got hold of my grandchild they wouldn't live. I would do time for them.\" </p> <p>Later, this matriarch admits that the marching and rioting has probably inflamed the situation, that people have become afraid of the pervert round every corner. </p> <p>\"It has made it worse. You are on tenterhooks all the time. It frightens me,\" she says, as she grabs Ernie, who is pulling at a white porcelain alsatian dog. </p> <p>The women don't have much truck with claims of mistaken identity. Sue's brother's car was burnt and his house was trashed while he was on holiday. He was entirely innocent, his name was simply the same as the man who lives upstairs, but Sue doesn't appreciate the finer irony of this. </p> <p>The women are trying to think of a solution to the problem. \"I want them out of here, but I wouldn't like them to go somewhere else where there was children,\" says Sharon. </p> <p>Her mother has the answer. She points through the wall, out towards the channel. </p> <p>\"They have got a little island out there - it's called No-Man's Island. Put them all there, give them no food and no drink and get each mother to go over there with a little bit of acid and burn them down below and they won't want to use it any more. I would volunteer to do it,\" she laughs. Then she adds: \"At the end of the day, I don't think anything will get done.\" </p> <p>The women cannot recall any case of a sexual assault on a child who lives near them over the last few years. Sharon says: \"There's been children who have said they have been touched, but there hasn't been nothing in the papers.\" </p> <p>Listening, Patsy pipes up about a paedophile: \"There was a man the other day hanging on a lamp-post and he was drunk and he just started saying all right love? to this woman.\" Jimmy points out that the man was drunk and it didn't make him a paedophile, but Patsy remains confused. </p> <p>Patsy says it has made her \"kind of happy\" to know about the perverts, but she giggles and says other kids have started going round asking men \"Are you a perv?\" </p> <p>In Paulsgrove, they don't wait for an answer. </p> <p><b> Victim with a vengeance</b><br> </p> <p> Katrina Kessell has been doing newspaper and television interviews all week and protesting for nine days with \"no sleep and hardly any housework done\". Now though, she casts her eyes to her self-appointed adviser when she is asked a question that is difficult. He then nods a yes, a no or says himself \"no comment\". </p> <p>Ms Kessell denies that she is usually the ringleader or spokesperson for the Paulsgrove Peaceful Protesters, although she is the one with the megaphone at the front of the march. </p> <p>She also says she personally does not have the alleged list of 20 paedophiles used by the protesters to find their targets, but she does admit that she keeps a lot of the details of these alleged offenders \"in her head\", including names and addresses. </p> <p>She says that the list is made up from the number of people who have come to her and said \"I was abused by so and so\". She claims she has seen documentary proof of the offences. She says: \"People have come up and shown us personal documents. </p> <p>\"Nine times out of 10, what is brought to us is official. The stuff is read by me and other people, then we go and check with the neighbours and then we check the electoral roll and confirm the details before we go to the houses. It didn't come from the internet. People have told me their stories and I have come away in tears a few times.\" </p> <p>The mother of four now refuses to say how many people are on the list, except that \"it's not in single figures\", but she adds that she expects the list to grow. Ms Kessell has agreed to hand over the list to the council. She says there will be talk about what will get the protesters to back down. Ultimately, she wants the law changed. </p> <p>She says that her motivation is that paedophiles are not being given long enough sentences. \"Justice has not been done for people that paedophiles have abused,\" she says. </p> <p>In an interview sold to a tabloid newspaper, Ms Kessell said that she had been sparked into action because she herself had been abused. She says: \"My upbringing has made it very hard for me to accept paedophiles in society. The problems I've had have had a terrible effect on my fam ily. It took a long time before I could cuddle my children. I have had a lot of therapy.\" </p> <p>Today, she says that paedophiles should not be allowed where there are children. \"They should be put together on an island somewhere,\" she said. \"I reckon they should be monitored very closely. There's a fort lying out in the middle of the Solent, no one's on that.\" </p> <p><b> Protester who quit</b><br> </p> <p> Jackie Rampton, 32, resigned from the protest when she discovered that the so-called list of paedophiles didn't exist. She realised that innocent people were being attacked on the grounds of hearsay. </p> <p>\"There is no list. I asked for it when I discovered they were going to target someone in my sister-in-law's road. They said to me the list's all mental. I said no way, you could not have a mental list, that you know every house and every road that has a paedophile. </p> <p>\"I think then, it did hit me what we were doing,\" she says. \"Don't get me wrong, I am with them all the way about paedophiles, but I believe they have nothing legal that says this person or that person is a paedophile. These people on this so-called list could have moved. </p> <p>\"Some of these things are supposed to date back 40 years. Now, I won't go to people's homes if I don't have a list.\" </p> <p>The mother of Gemma, 12, and Luke, nine months, feels ashamed because she enjoyed walking up the street with a gang of other women, all shouting to get the paedophiles out. </p> <p>\"I can't help it but this is how I felt. Walking the streets with all the noise, I got a buzz out of it. I know it sounds really childish. But then I came back here and though 'what have I done'. I saw sense.\" </p> <p>As Jackie speaks, Gemma and her friends are dancing in the bedroom to a Daphne and Celeste CD. After shouting to them to turn it down, Jackie says she did it for them. </p> <p>\"I would never protect a paedophile. Now, I think if we have been to innocent people's homes, then I am ashamed. I do think it has got a bit hysterical. And because of what's happened we have been made to look like riff-raff. I used to walk down that shop and hold my head up high and now I feel that everyone is looking at me in disgust,\" she says. </p> <p>\"My intention was not to have a witchhunt. They won't win this, the protests are not going to go on forever. At the end of the day I am not going to change it and neither is anyone else. As much as anyone would like to, we can't.\"</p>",
  "<p>A funny thing happens as you drive down the road to Jaywick. The bungalows get smaller and smaller. It's as if something strange has occurred out here where the Essex marshes meet the grey North Sea. And, in a way, that's right. </p> <p>Look around. Have you strayed into one of those model villages that were once all the rage in our seaside resorts? Did some barmy farmer build himself a private Lilliput, then abandon it to the north-east wind? You're getting warmer. </p> <p>See here. Some of them look no bigger than beach huts, yet these little wood-framed houses are occupied. Cars park higgledy-piggledy beside cracked-up concrete alleys. Children make their way home from the local primary school. Laughter erupts from the Dolphin Diner. These miniature streets, with the beach at one end and cows grazing at the other, are for real. </p> <p>But why are so many of the tiny homes coming apart, like Wendy houses left to decay in a corner of the garden? Why are the streets so broken and ill-lit at night? And why, here's a question for you, why are so many of them named after cars? </p> <p>Here are Talbot, Wolseley, Sunbeam and Hillman, Austin, Alvis, Humber and Vauxhall. There's a Singer and a Riley, a Napier and a Lincoln. There's even a Rover somewhere (but not a BMW in sight). Glance at the map, and you see at once that the streets have been drawn to resemble the bars of a radiator grille, growing from a single road called Brooklands. </p> <p>And that's the vital clue. For just as the electric Metropolitan Railway gave rise in the 20s to Metroland, a belt of commuter \"villages\" in the countryside north of London, so the car, in its turn, spawned a phenomenon known as Plotlands. In the years between the wars, the better-off city dweller with a set of wheels and a little cash to spare could, for around \u00a350, buy a modest plot by the sea, and there build - or buy ready-built - a bungalow on stilts, or a cabin made with grooved weatherboarding, painted with Solignum and roofed with Anderson's Rok-Flextile in two colours. </p> <p>During the 30s, hundreds of plots such as this were carved out of a marshland farm two miles down the road from Clacton-on-Sea to form the resort village of Jaywick Sands. There were no drains then, and no mains water. But why would cabins need such things? Plans for the structures were passed under by-laws governing the siting of tents, caravans and huts. The little houses were never meant to be permanent, you see. At least, that was the theory. </p> <p>But 30 years on, the cabins were still standing - and not just standing, but enjoying a new lease of life. This time, it was as holiday accommodation for working-class families from London's East End. When they clapped eyes on the little houses by the beach, the East Enders took them to their hearts. And home is where the heart is. </p> <p>\"What some people would do,\" says Joan Matthews, \"is rent a place down here for the last two weeks in the summer, then move in and change the locks.\" And Joan can understand why. It was 1964 when she and her husband came down for a fortnight's holiday, and it was love at first sight. The following year they were back. Then they spotted a bungalow on the market, put down a deposit, and by January 1966 they were in. \"It was pouring with rain when we got here,\" says Joan. \"We looked at one another and thought, what have we let ourselves in for? But they say if you can last one winter down here, you're all right. And, in my opinion, you won't find a better place, anywhere, than Jaywick. I like the people.\" </p> <p>When Joan moved in, she reckons the bungalows had barely 100 inhabitants. Today, there are more than 1,000, and the majority of the structures are occupied all year round. But if the people are friendly and the situation grand, the accommodation has left much to be desired. After a brief spell living in Kent, Joan returned to Jaywick and to a rented bungalow. </p> <p>As the years went by, the idyll of a wooden cabin by the beach began to wear thin. Many of the bungalows were rough-and-ready affairs, constructed from asbestos and incorporating wooden packing cases from Ford's at Dagenham. \"The floors had gone,\" says Joan. \"There was no ceiling in the kitchen, and no cupboards. There was no putty in the windows, and every time the back door banged, pebbledash would fall off the outside wall. The place was declared unfit 10 years ago, and it was supposed to have come down then.\" </p> <p>As she talks, she looks around the lofty cream interior of the place she now calls home. \"This,\" she says, \"this is heaven - and I mean heaven. I can sleep at night, I don't cough so much, and I've never had so many cupboards in all my life.\" </p> <p>Appropriately, Joan's \"heaven\" is in a new street called Lotus Way. Built by the Guinness Trust housing association as part of a regeneration programme aimed at improving economic and social conditions in the village, the development comprises 40 homes whose innovative design won a RIBA award for the architects Pollard Thomas and Edwards. With back-sloping roofs and walls clad with timber planks that smell of pine woods on a summer's afternoon, the Lotus Way houses echo the local beach-hut vernacular. But there the similarity ends. For these homes are custom-built for their exposed location. To make the most of the sunshine, living rooms and bedrooms face south or west, and have large windows; even the gardens are arranged in such a way that they trap the sun. Conversely, rooms with north and east elevations have small windows, and a shelter-belt of trees has been planted to protect these walls from the biting winter winds. </p> <p>Inside, too, the Lotus Way homes could hardly be more different from the cramped bungalows that were simply not built for families. For three years, Avril and George Cutts and their 10-year-old grand- daughter, Chantel, have been crammed into a shoebox property whose biggest bedroom would barely take a double bed and whose atmosphere was clammy with the smell of bottled gas. Now they have light and air, and for the first time, Avril has been able to buy a three-seater sofa knowing that her living room is large enough to accommodate it. </p> <p>Lotus Way is now home to 58 adults and 56 children, and already the street has that feeling of neighbourliness on which Jaywick residents pride themselves. But there is more to regeneration than building a couple of rows of fresh new houses. As Mary Puddick, resident and chair of the Community Forum, says, \"The unfortunate thing about Jaywick is that it needed to be taken into the 21st century step by step by step. But it got left behind.\" </p> <p>One person who is determined to put that situation right - with the residents, rather than simply for them - is Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Quinlivan. Employed by the Guinness Trust to work as a regeneration project manager with the community, she knows the importance of working from the ground up. \"When we started,\" she says, \"nobody would come to public meetings. So instead we talked to people where they were, whether it was on the beach or in the cafe.\" It worked, and before long, she was painfully familiar with Jaywick's many problems. \"For a long time it was considered a thorn in the side of the council. In the 70s, they wanted to flatten the whole place, but the residents went to the High Court and won. Up until then, water had come from standpipes at the end of each street. After the court case, drainage and mains water were put in.\" </p> <p>But the drains, says Quinlivan, were inadequate, and today they need upgrading, along with virtually everything else, including the crumbling streets that are awash with water in the winter, so that anyone with a wheelchair has no choice but to stay indoors. </p> <p>And then there are the social problems. Unemployment is particularly high, and a third of primary-school children have special needs. \"Twelve years ago,\" says Quinlivan, \"there was a lot of infighting going on here, with firebombings and all sorts. But there is nothing like that now. And yet the place still has a terrible reputation in the area. A lot of the people here have opted out of normal society. You can disappear very easily in a place like Jaywick. Some may be running away from ex-partners or the police. And many came from London just to get away from violent communities.\" </p> <p>But, time and again, the people you speak to at Jaywick tell you that this is a special place - that you either love it or hate it, and that they love it. \"I've met more interesting people here than anywhere else I've worked,\" says Quinlivan. </p> <p>Some locals, it seems, are fearful of any change, however, even if their homes are falling down around their ears. \"The idea of Lotus Way was to rehouse people living in the 40 worst properties,\" says Quinlivan, but, when it came to it, nobody from the worst properties came forward.\" </p> <p>So, although there is likely to be a second phase of house-building in the future - a mix, perhaps, of self-build and shared-ownership homes - the Trust, in partnership with the community, local authority and other agencies, is now concentrating on improving the most dilapidated bungalows, getting the infrastructure upgraded and persuading people to take up the various services available to them. </p> <p>Much of Quinlivan's job involves applying for funding from a variety of sources - from the EU to the lottery - while at the same time encouraging residents to take control of their own destinies and, ultimately, even to manage their own neighbourhood. \"We don't want to take over,\" she says. \"I actually think of myself as working for people here rather than for the Guinness Trust.\" </p> <p>She first visited Jaywick Sands as a little girl. \"My aunt had a chalet here 35 years ago,\" she says, \"and I can still remember the beach and the standpipes. So, when this job came up, I jumped at it. </p> <p>\"And then I came down here. It was a February day, cold and grey, and when I saw it I felt embarrassed to have a nice Victorian house in Colchester when there were people living here like this. I knew then that I couldn't just walk away from it.\"</p>",

Macaulay Culkin has separated from Rachel, his wife of two years, presumably because he put his hands on his cheeks and went, \"Waaaaaaaaagh!\" once too often.

It was in the Telegraph, so it can't be a joke. The law is a response to complaints from second-home-owning city-dwellers, whose weekends have been ruined by creatures crowing at the crack of dawn, quacking persistently throughout the day and shitting without due care for the olfactory consequences. \"If you come and live in the country, you have to put up with the noises and the smells we have,\" said one farmer, apparently unaware that the legislation is aimed at the animals, not the farmers themselves. Or maybe he just knows that the jig is already up for the beasts, so he's getting in early with his defence of the farm-worker's cavalier attitude towards deodorants and unwarranted snorts. </p> <p>As well as providing welcome closure to the Countryside: Workplace Or Theme Park? controversy, the story highlights a difficulty faced by governments, local and national, throughout the world. People don't pay attention. For years they've been telling us to stop stealing, to stop being poor, to get somewhere decent to live, to stop taking drugs, to stop homosexualing all over the place. We don't listen. In Colorado, I can't tell you how many times they have stressed the importance of being careful with cigarette ends and barbecues. At the time of writing, the whole state is on fire. So, despairing of ever having any effect on people, the governments have turned on the animals. </p> <p>Like most spirited observers, I'm looking forward to the farm animal debate coming to Britain. Compared with the standard of debate we've seen recently - certainly on Section 28, hunting and the euro - it should provide a forum for sound sense and rational argument. Essentially, I find myself in the pro- legislation lobby. For too long, it seems to me, animals have had it their own way in the noise and smell stakes. Some animals are admittedly better than others. Cows, for instance, can be quite reticent when they feel like it. They often stand in sullen silence for a whole afternoon. Mostly, one suspects, they're sullen about the sheep, who, with their remorseless bleating, give the other animals a bad name. On the other hand, sheep aren't nearly as bad at smelling. If I were to be captured by some rough agricultural labourers, out for a spot of rustic fun, and forced to choose between a fart in the face from a cow and a fart in the face from a sheep, I would not need to phone a friend. </p> <p>Pigs are another matter entirely. On the same day as the Telegraph printed the Colorado farm-noise story, the Mail had a piece about the use of animal organs in transplant surgery that featured a picture of Milestone, the recently cloned pig. If you've seen the photograph, you will agree that, even by pig standards, Milestone is a fabulously attractive pig. Beautiful snout-texture, and eyes with that Gene Kelly, philosophically-amused-but-nonetheless-vulnerable quality that make you want that pig to grunt, sing, do what the hell he likes. It's not definite yet whether they'll be making further clones of Milestone, or whether they'll actually be using Milestone or any of his clones for organ transplantation, but, if they are, I want those eyes. </p> <p> Admittedly, anti-squawking and stinking legislation could be hard to implement. Cows go moo. Sheep go baa. Ducks go quack. A child could tell you that. Therapy has worked with compulsively barking dogs, but then dogs are pathetically simple creatures. Therapy with cows could be more tricky. You only have to look at cows - mad or otherwise - to know that they have many issues, the least of which is mooing. A therapist would need to be on call for weeks, years. Even then, most authorities agree, there would be little likelihood of progress. But clearly the Colorado State Legislature knows better. The Colorado State Legislature knows that there is plenty that farmers could be doing to stop their animals squawking and stinking, but until now they've never made a proper effort. Whether the prospect of a $350 fine is the incentive they need to go that extra mile remains to be seen. </p> <p>Macaulay Culkin is 19.</p> <p>\u0095 Alexander Chancellor is away.</p>",
  "<p>August of our first summer in France was spent in La Teste sur Mer, a tiny oyster village on the Bassin d'Arcachon in the Gironde. We stayed with my aunt, Tante Jeanne, and my uncle, Oncle Gustav, in the same white stuccoed house where my father had summered as a boy. Tante Jeanne was a frumpy, bespectacled, slightly smelly old woman; Oncle Gustav, a geezer in coveralls and beret who smoked hand-rolled cigarettes until they disappeared on to the tip of his tongue. Little had changed about La Teste in the years since my father had vacationed there. The neighbours were still all oyster fishermen. Their families still raised rabbits and grew tomatoes in their backyards. Houses had two kitchens, an inside one and an outdoor \"fish kitchen\". There was a hand pump for drinking water from a well, and an outhouse by the rear of the garden. </p> <p>My brother and I were reasonably happy here. The beaches were warm, there were lizards to hunt down and exterminate with readily available p\u00e9tards, firecrackers, which one could buy legally (!) over-the-counter. There was a forest within walking distance where an actual hermit lived, and my brother and I spent hours there, spying on him from the underbrush. By now I could read comic books in French and, of course, I was eating - really eating. Murky brown soupe de poisson, tomato salad, moules marini\u00e8res, poulet basquaise (we were only a few miles from the Basque country). We made day trips to Cap Ferret, a wild, deserted and breathtakingly magnificent Atlantic beach with big rolling waves, taking along baguettes and saucissons and wheels of cheese, wine and Evian (bottled water was at that time unheard of back home). A few miles west was Lac Cazeaux, a fresh-water lake where my brother and I could rent p\u00e9dalo watercraft. We ate gaufres, delicious hot waffles, covered in whipped cream and powdered sugar. The two hot songs of that summer on the Cazeaux jukebox were Whiter Shade Of Pale by Procol Harum and These Boots Were Made For Walkin' by Nancy Sinatra. The French played those two songs over and over again, the music punctuated by the sonic booms from French air force jets that would swoop over the lake on their way to a nearby bombing range. </p> <p>When our neighbour, Monsieur Saint-Jour, the oyster fisherman, invited my family out on his penas (oyster boat), I was enthusiastic. </p> <p>At six in the morning, we boarded Monsieur Saint-Jour's small wooden vessel with our picnic baskets and our sensible footwear. He was a crusty old bastard, dressed like my uncle in ancient denim coveralls, espadrilles and beret. He had a leathery, tanned and windblown face, hollow cheeks, and the tiny broken blood vessels on his nose and cheeks that everyone seemed to have from drinking so much of the local Bordeaux. We put-putted out to a buoy marking his underwater oyster parc, a fenced-off section of the bay bottom, and we sat . . . and sat . . . and sat, in the roaring August sun, waiting for the tide to go out. The idea was to float the boat over the stockaded fence walls, then sit there as the boat slowly sank with the water level, until it rested on the basin floor. At this point, Monsieur Saint-Jour would rake the oysters, collect a few good specimens for sale in port, and remove any parasites that might be endangering his crop. </p> <p>There was, I recall, still about two feet of water left to go before the hull of the boat settled on dry ground and we could walk about the parc. We'd already polished off the Brie and baguettes, but I was still hungry, and characteristically said so. </p> <p>Monsieur Saint-Jour, on hearing this - as if challenging his American passengers - inquired in his thick Girondais accent if any of us would care to try an oyster. </p> <p>My parents hesitated. I doubt they'd realised they might have actually to eat one of the raw, slimy things we were currently floating over. My little brother recoiled in horror. </p> <p>But I, in the proudest moment of my young life, stood up smartly, grinning with defiance, and volunteered to be the first. </p> <p>And in that unforgettably sweet moment, that one moment still more alive for me than so many of the other \"firsts\" that followed - first sex, first joint, first day in high school, first published book - I attained glory. Monsieur Saint-Jour beckoned me over to the gunwale, where he leaned over, reached down until his head nearly disappeared underwater, and emerged holding a single silt-encrusted oyster, huge and irregularly shaped, in his rough, clawlike fist. With a snubby, rust-covered oyster knife, he popped the thing open and handed it to me, everyone watching now, my little brother shrinking away from this glistening, vaguely sexual-looking object, still dripping and nearly alive. </p> <p>I took it in my hand, tilted the shell back into my mouth as instructed by the by now beaming Monsieur Saint-Jour, and with one bite and a slurp wolfed it down. It tasted of seawater . . . of brine and flesh . . . and, somehow . . . of the future. </p> <p>Everything was different now. Everything. </p> <p>I'd not only survived - I'd enjoyed . </p> <p>This, I knew, was the magic I had until now been only dimly and spitefully aware of. I was hooked. My parents' shudders, my little brother's expression of unrestrained revulsion and amazement only reinforced the sense that I had, somehow, become a man. I had had an adventure , tasted forbidden fruit, and everything that followed in my life - the food, the long and often stupid and self-destructive chase for the next thing , whether it was drugs or sex or some other new sensation - would all stem from this moment. </p> <p>I'd learned something. Viscerally, instinctively, spiritually - even in some small, precursive way, sexually - and there was no turning back. The genie was out of the bottle. My life as a cook, and as a chef, had begun. </p> <p>In 1981, my good friend from high school, Sam G, became the chef de cuisine of Work Progress. A once-trendy restaurant on Spring Street in SoHo, the place had fallen on hard times. It was now under new ownership and Sammy - one of us ! - was in charge of putting the kitchen together. It was what a lot of us had been waiting for, our own thing, and the call went out to all our old cronies. From Provincetown, Cape Cod, where I'd had my first job as a dishwasher, came Dimitri, enticed by excited promises of culinary history in the making. From West Village saloons, we recruited every young, pot-smoking, head-banging hooligan we'd ever worked with, filling their heads with dreams of glory. \"We're forming . . . like . . . a rock-and-roll band, man, an all-star group of culinary superstars . . . kinda like Blind Faith. We're going to tear a new asshole into the New York restaurant scene.\" </p> <p>We fancied ourselves the most know-ledgeable and experienced young Turks in town, and our hearts were filled with hope and the promise of enviable futures. We thought we were the only cooks in New York who could quote from the Larousse Gastronomique and R\u00e9pertoire de la Cuisine, who knew who Vatel, Car me and Escoffier were, what Bocuse, Verg\u00e9 and Gu\u00e9rard were doing across the water, and we were determined to replicate their successes and their fame. There was no one on the horizon we could see who could touch us. </p> <p>The new owners of Work Progress, our putative masters, were a textbook example of People Who Should Never Own A Restaurant. There were two brothers - one half-smart, the other genuinely dumb - who'd gotten a few bucks from Mommy and Daddy, along with their partner, a slightly more cognizant college friend who could actually read a P and L sheet and crunch a few numbers. Their principal business was investing in off-Broadway shows. As this, apparently, wasn't unprofitable enough, they'd chosen the restaurant business as a way to lose their money more quickly and assuredly. </p> <p>From the get-go, Sammy, Dimitri and I managed to intimidate the partners right out of their own restaurant. At every suggestion from this novice triumvirate, we'd snort with contempt, roll our eyes with world-weary derision and shoot down whatever outrage - be it tablecloths, flatware or menu items - they'd come up with. </p> <p>We fought all the time, Sam, Dimitri and I. Waving our cookbooks at each other, we'd squabble endlessly over the \"correct\" way to prepare certain dishes. We teased, poked, prodded, sulked, conspired and competed. We wanted to be the best, we wanted to be different but, at the same time, correct. We came up with the looniest, most ambitious menu our endorphin-overloaded brains could agree on, a sort of Greatest Hits Of Our Checkered Careers So Far collection. French classics sat side-by-side with Portuguese squid stew, my Tante Jeanne's humble salade de tomates, dishes we'd lifted out of cookbooks, stolen from other chefs, remembered seeing on TV. There were Wellfleet oysters on the halfshell, there was a pasta dish from Mario's - a sort of taglierini with trail-mix and anchovies, as I recall - scallops in sorrel sauce (from Bocuse, maybe?), calves' liver with raspberry-vinegar sauce, swordfish with black beans and white rice, pompano en papillotte, my mom's cr\u00e8me renvers\u00e9e . . . </p> <p>We were high all the time, sneaking off to the walk-in at every opportunity to \"conceptualise\". Hardly a decision was made without drugs. We worked long hours and took considerable pride in our efforts - the drugs, we thought, having little effect on the end-product. That was what the life we were in was about, we believed. We might be tripping out on blotter acid, sleepless for three days and halfway through a bottle of Stoli, but we were professionals , goddammit! We didn't let it affect our line work. And we were happy, truly happy, like Henry V's lucky few, a band of brothers, ragged, slightly debauched warriors, who anticipated nothing less than total victory - an Agincourt of the mind and stomach. </p> <p>We were pretty busy initially and, along with the young prot\u00e9g\u00e9s who held us in something like awe, Sam, Dimitri and I would work all day and late into the night. When the restaurant closed, we'd take over the bar, drinking Cristal - which we'd buy at cost - and running fat rails of coke from one end of the bar to the other, then crawling along on all-fours to snort them. The cuter and more degenerate members of the floor staff would hang with us, so there was a lot of humping in the dry-goods area and on the banquettes, 50-pound flour sacks being popular staging areas for after-work copulation. A squadron of punk rocker junkie guitar heroes ate for free at Work Progress - so we got free tickets and backstage passes to the Mudd Club, CBGB, Tier Three, Hurrah, Club 57 and so on. And when the clubs closed it was off to after-hours, where we'd drink and do more drugs until, weather permitting, we'd hit the seven o'clock train to Long Beach. We'd finish the last of our smack on the train, then pass out on the beach. Whichever one of us woke from the nod would roll the others over to avoid an uneven burn. When we finally arrived back at work, sand in our hair, we looked tanned, rested and ready. </p> <p>We considered ourselves a tribe. As such, we had a number of unusual customs and rituals all our own. If you cut yourself in the Work Progress kitchen, tradition called for maximum spillage and dispersion of blood. One squeezed the wound till it ran freely, then hurled great gouts of red spray on the jackets and aprons of comrades. We loved blood in our kitchen. If you dinged yourself badly, it was no disgrace; we'd stencil a little cut-out shape of a chef knife under your station to commemorate the event. After a while, you'd have a little row of these things, like a fighter pilot. The house cat - a mouse-killer - got her own stencil (a tiny mouse shape) sprayed on the wall by her water bowl, signifying confirmed kills. </p> <p>We cared little for managers or owners - or customers, for that matter. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, our restaurant was rapidly failing. I began to see, for the first time, what I would later recognise as Failing Restaurant Syndrome, an affliction that causes owners to flail about looking for a quick fix, a masterstroke that will \"turn things around\", reverse the already irreversible trend toward insolvency. We tried New Orleans Brunch - complete with Dixieland band. We tried a prix fixe menu, a Sunday night buffet, we advertised and we hired a publicist. Each successive brainstorm was more counterproductive than the one before. </p> <p>When the paychecks started bouncing, and the vendors started to put us on COD (cash on delivery), the owners called in the restaurant consultants. Even then, we knew what that meant: the consultants usually arrive just ahead of the repo men and the marshals. It was the death knell. We had tried. We had failed. Naturally, we held the owners responsible. It was a tough spot, the ambiance was no good, the music in the dining room sucked, the waiters weren't well trained . . . But the truth was, we just weren't good enough. Our food, while charming to some, was unappealing to most. We did not commit seppuku. Sam and Dimitri stayed on, determined to go down with the ship. </p> <p>But my cousin had hooked me up with my very first chef job, at a spanking-new but already troubled bote in the theatre district, and I jumped at the offer. I felt bad about leaving my friends behind. And I had the beginnings of a very nasty little heroin habit from all the dope I'd been sniffing - but hey! I was about to become a chef! </p> <p>It is one of the central ironies of my career that as soon as I got off heroin, things started getting really bad. High on dope, I was at least a chef, well paid, much liked by crew and floor and owners alike. Stabilised on methadone, I became nearly unemployable by polite society: a shiftless, untrustworthy coke-sniffer, sneak thief and corner-cutting hack, toiling in the culinary backwaters. </p> <p>I worked a seedy hotel on upper Madison, a place so slow that the one waiter would have to come downstairs and wake me when customers came in. I worked a lunch counter on Amsterdam, flipping pancakes and doing short-order eggs for politicos and their bagmen. I worked a bizarre combination art gallery/bistro on Columbus, just me and a coke-dealing bartender - a typically convenient and destructive symbiotic arrangement. I was a sous chef at a very fine two-star place on 39th, where I dimly recall preparing a four-course meal for Paul Bocuse; he thanked me in French, I think. I worked a deserted crab house on Second Avenue. I cooked brunches in SoHo, I slopped out steam-table chow at a bar on 8th Street to a bunch of drunks. </p> <p>For a time, I took another chef's job - of sorts - at a moment of need at Billy's, a combo sit-down/take-out upscale chicken joint on Bleecker Street. It was an operation that was to be the flagship of another planned empire, a chain of chicken joints that would stretch across the globe. </p> <p>At this low point in my career, I didn't care if the place succeeded or not. I needed the money. </p> <p>My boss was an older Jewish guy, fresh out of prison, who'd named the place after his youngest son, Billy, a feckless ne'er-do-well. He had been, in an earlier life, the head of the counting room at a Las Vegas casino and, after being caught skimming off millions for the \"boys back in New York and Cincinnati\", had been offered a friendly deal should he co-operate with the prosecutors. He had, admirably, declined, and as a result spent the last five years eating prison chow. When he got out, a near-broken man, his old buddies in New York, being Men of Honour, set him up with this restaurant as a sign of gratitude for services rendered. </p> <p>Unfortunately, while in prison, the old man had completely lost his mind. He may have been a stand-up guy, but he was absolutely barking mad. </p> <p>This was not a classic bust-out operation, where the mob deliberately runs a place into the ground, using a front man/straw owner to run up bills, then pillage the place for merchandise and credit. I think that the wise guys really wanted the poor slob to make money and be a success. They made earnest efforts to help at every turn, enduring much nonsense from their visibly deranged partner. </p> <p>I'd seen mobsters around before, of course, but I'd never worked in a place that was out-and-out mobbed up, where I came to know on a personal basis real wise guys, whose names I recognised from the papers. Everyone was astonishingly up-front about their connections. My boss was fond of yelling into the phone when discussing prices with a purveyor, \"You know who I am? You know who I'm with ?!\" </p> <p>We did things differently at Billy's. </p> <p>My cooks, for one: every one of them came from the Fortune Society, guys who spent their off-hours in halfway houses, allowed out only to work. I was used to working with a fairly rough bunch, a lot of whom, at one time or another, had had problems with the law - but at Billy's every single one of my cooks was still basically a convict. I can't say that it was an unhappy arrangement, either; for once, I knew my cooks were going to show up at work every day - if they didn't, they went back to prison. </p> <p>And credit was easily obtained. I knew, from previous experience, how difficult it is to set up terms for a new restaurant; even getting a week's credit with some of these companies was usually a lengthy process, involving credit applications, a long wait, initial periods of cash on delivery. At Billy's, no sooner was I off the phone than the stuff was arriving, often on 60-day terms. </p> <p>My boss spent a lot of time on the phone, investigating the serious business of horses and their bloodlines, and how well they ran in mud or on grass. Billy himself, at 18, was happy to drive his sports car around and chase girls. So my day-to-day was spent mostly with some genial gentlemen from an Italian Fraternal Organisation. They helpfully told me where to buy my meat and poultry, and how to meet the folks who would be supplying my linen, bread, paper goods and so on. I had a lot of meetings in cars. </p> <p>\"The bread guy is here,\" I'd be told, and a late-model Buick would pull up out front. An old guy in a mashed-down golf cap would beckon me from the driver's seat and then get out of the car. The older guy in the passenger seat would slide over, indicating he wanted me to get in, sit next to him and talk. We'd sit there in the idling car, talking cryptically about bread, before he brought me around to the trunk to examine some product. It was a strange business. </p> <p>My boss got wackier and wackier. When we finally opened, we were packed from the first minute. Orders flooded in over the phone and at the counter and at the tables. We were unprepared and understaffed, so the Italian contingent - including various visiting dignitaries, all with oddly anglicised names (\"This is Mr Dee, Tony, and meet a friend, Mr Brown . . . This is Mr Lang\"), all of them overweight, cigar-chomping, middle-aged guys with bodyguards and 10,000-dollar watches - pitched in to help out. Guys I'd read about later in the papers as running construction in the outer boroughs, purported killers, made men, who lived in concrete piles on Staten Island and Long Beach and security-fenced estates in Jersey, carried brown paper bags of chicken sandwiches up three flights of stairs to Greenwich Village walk-up apartments to make deliveries; they slathered mayo and avocado slices on pitta bread behind the counter, and bussed tables in the dining room. I have to say I liked them for that. </p> <p>But when my boss, inexplicably, showed up one day and told me to fire everyone with a tattoo on my staff, I was faced with a dilemma. Every one of my cooks was festooned with prison tats: screaming skulls, Jesus on hypodermic crosses, bound in barbed wire, gang tats, flaming dice, swastikas, SS flashes, Born to Lose, Born Dead, Love Hate, Mom, portraits of the Madonna, wives, girlfriends, Ozzy Osbourne. I tried to put him off, explaining that we couldn't do without these guys, that the hardest-working, most indispensable guy we had - the guy who right now was loading trash cans with hundreds of marinating chicken parts in the cramped, stifling unrefrigerated cellar on his 22nd consecutive double shift - he was a goddamn Sistine Chapel of skin art. And where am I going to find a convict without a tattoo? The Watergate burglars weren't, to my knowledge, available. </p> <p>Things only got worse. He came in the next day, obsessing about gold chains and jewellery. My grill man had the usual ghetto adornments of the day. \"Where do you think that eggplant [aubergine] got all that gold?\" he raved, spraying food and saliva as he talked. \"Selling drugs. That shit is poison ! Mugging old ladies! I don't want that in my restaurant! Get him out!\" This was clearly impossible, and I sought counsel with one of the silent partners who, as my boss had become increasingly unpredictable, had grown noticeably less silent. \"You hear what he wants me to do?\" I asked. The man just nodded and rolled his eyes, sympathetically, I thought. </p> <p>\"Do nothing,\" he said, and then, with truly dangerous intonation, added, \"Aspetta,\" meaning \"Wait\" in Italian. </p> <p>I didn't like the sound of that. He smiled at me, and I couldn't help picturing my boss, slumped over a dashboard after one of those meetings in a car they were all so fond of. When things came to a head a few days later, my boss openly screaming in the middle of a crowded dining room that he wanted all the tattooed guys and gold chain-wearers \"Out! Now!\" I told him to pay me what he owed - I was leaving for good. He refused. The silent partner came over, peeled off my pay and an extra hundred from a fat roll in his suit pocket, and gave me a warm smile as he bade me goodbye. </p> <p>I don't know what happened to Billy's. It certainly never developed into a worldwide chain as my crazed boss had envisioned - or even a second store. The next time I was in the neighbourhood, a picture framer occupied the space where the restaurant had been. What happened to the old man and his dreams of a poultry empire for his son? I can only guess. </p> <p> After what he calls the \"wilderness years\" and an interlude launching a high-profile Tuscan restaurant, Bourdain happily fetched up two years ago as chef at Les Halles, a successful New York brasserie. He's there still, having also found time to write a couple of novels. </p> <p>There was a lull in service the other night, one of those all-too-brief periods of about 10 minutes when the floor staff is busy trying to turn tables, and even though the bar is packed three deep with waiting customers and there's a line out the door, the kitchen is quiet. </p> <p>I stood in the doorway to the cellar prep kitchen and smoked a cigarette nervously. We were in that eerie, eye-of-the-hurricane calm. When the next wave of hungry public had been seated and breaded and watered, there'd be a punishing rush. First, the salad guy would get hit, then the saut\u00e9 station and finally the grill, until everything came down at once - the whole bunch of us in the cramped kitchen struggling and sweating and cursing to move orders out without falling in the weeds. We had only a few moments of peace to go, and I smoked and fidgeted and half-listened to what my crew was talking about. </p> <p>The tone of the repartee was familiar, as was the subject matter - and I realised that, my God . . . I've been listening to the same conversation for 25 years ! </p> <p>Who's the bigger homo? Who takes it in the ass? Who, exactly, at this particular moment, is a p\u00e9d\u00e9, a maric\u00f3n, a fanocchio, a puta a pato? It's all about dick, you see. </p> <p>This is the real international language of cuisine, I realised, watching my French sous-chef, American ptissier, Mexican grill, salad and fry guys exchange playful insults with the Bengali runner and the Dominican dishwasher. </p> <p>As an art form, cooktalk is, like haiku or kabuki, defined by established rules, with a rigid, traditional framework in which one may operate. All comments must , out of historical necessity, concern involuntary rectal penetration, penis size, physical flaws or annoying mannerisms or defects. </p> <p>The rules can be confusing. Pinche wey means \"fucking guy\", but can also mean \"you adorable scamp\" or \"pal\". But if you use the word \"pal\" - or, worse, \"my friend\" - in my kitchen, it'll make people paranoid. \"My friend\" famously means \"asshole\" in the worst and most sincere sense of that word. And start being too nice to a cook on the line and he might think he's getting canned tomorrow. My vato locos are, like most line cooks, practitioners of that centuries-old oral tradition in which we - all of us - try to find new and amusing ways to talk about dick. </p> <p>Homophobic, you say? Sub-mental? Insensitive to gender preference, and the gorgeous mosaic of an ethnically diverse work force? Gee . . . you might be right. Does a locker-room environment like this make it tougher for women, for instance? Yep. Most women, sadly. But what the system seeks, what it requires, is someone, anyone , who can hold up their station, play the game without getting bent out of shape and taking things personally. </p> <p>But let's say you do \"take it in the twins\", it's no impediment to survival. We're too busy, and too close, and we spend too much time together as an extended, dysfunctional family to care about sex, gender preference, race or national origin. After level of skills, it's how sensitive you are to criticism and perceived insult - and how well you can give it right back - that determines your place in the food chain. I've been flaco and cadavro, probably borracho. That's just the way it is. I call down to my prep kitchen on the intercom - calling for butter or more sauce - and that little gangster who keeps my stock rotated and makes that lovely chiffonaded parsley for me is going to reply (after I'm out of hearing), \" Fuuck YOUU!! \" before giving me exactly what I asked for. Better I say it first: \"Gimme my fucking mantequilla and sauce, motherfucker. Horita . . . and . . . fuuuck YOU!\" And I love that little thug, too - the headband-sporting, baggy-pantsed, top button-buttoned, bottom button open, moon boot-shod, half Puerto Rican, half cholo vato loco, with his crude prison-style tats and his butterfly knife tucked in his wristband. I have, on many occasions, pondered adopting him. He's everything I'd want in a son. </p> <p>It's been 27 years since I walked into the Dreadnaught kitchen in Provincetown with my hair halfway down my back, a bad attitude, and a marginal desire to maybe do a little work in return for money. </p> <p>How much longer am I going to do this? </p> <p>I don't know. I love it, you see. </p> <p>I love heating duck confit, saucisson de canard, confit gizzards, saucisson de Toulouse, poitrine and duck fat with those wonderful tarbais beans, spooning it into an earthenware crock and sprinkling it with breadcrumbs. I love making those little mountains of chive-mashed potatoes, wild mushrooms, ris de veau, a nice, tall micro-green salad as garnish, drizzling a perfectly reduced sauce around the plate with my favourite spoon. I enjoy the look on the face of my boss when I do a pot-au-feu special - the look of sheer delight as he takes the massive bowl of braised hooves, shoulders and tails in, the simple boiled turnips, potatoes and carrots looking just right, just the way it should be. I love that look, the same look I get when I approach a plate of perfect oysters. It's a gaze of wonder: the same look you see on small children's faces when their fathers take them into deep water at the beach, and it's always a beautiful thing. For a moment, or a second, the pinched expressions of the cynical, world-weary, throat-cutting, miserable bastards we've all had to become disappears when we're confronted with a something as simple as a plate of food. When we remember what it was that moved us down this road in the first place.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,353201,00.html\">Read the second part of the extract here</a></p> <p>\u00a9 Anthony Bourdain, 2000</p> <p>This is an edited extract from Kitchen Confidential: Adventures In The Culinary Underbelly, by Anthony Bourdain, published by Bloomsbury on August 21, priced \u00a316.99. <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502444710.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p>",
  "<p>I once had a very dear friend whose dancing was described as \"stiff in all the wrong places\". This Government, in contrast, is liberal in all the wrong places. If you are a sick person waiting for an operation, an old person waiting for a decent pension rise or an unemployed person hoping for a little dignity - you're joking, aren't you? If, however, you are a psychopathic Irish murderer of either denomination, General Pinochet or a paedophile with an average of 300 offences against children by the time you're finally caught (as the average paedophile does), you can expect to be chucked under the chin and sent along home with an ominous, \"And don't do it again!\" Watching the Maze murderers trot off to get their \"compensation\", never has that old Private Eye line about misplaced clemency rung truer: MURDER NOW AND WIN A FORD FIESTA! </p> <p>Why do governments, establishments and judicial systems of every complexion do all they can to let nasty people get away with things - be they the IMF or a kinky headmaster - while pouring contempt on the meek, the poor and the law-abiding? I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I've come to the conclusion that civilised \"soft\" men - that is, men who push pens, make laws and wear white collars for a living - in a horrible primeval part of their minds, still believe that they should be uncivilised \"hard\" men; men who go around causing havoc, hurt and mayhem wherever they can. They obviously can't chuck it all in and run off to enact a career of evil themselves, but when they are called upon by the people to deal with such types, their innate sympathy and self-loathing show through in the way that they do not come down on them with the full force of the law but rather bend over backwards to excuse any old wife murderer, child molester, mad bomber or Fascist dictator. Forge a banknote or sell some drugs, however, and they'll clap you away for life; your crimes weren't \"manly\" enough, you see. </p> <p>Of course, I don't go along with mad old Mugabe in believing that this Government is made up exclusively of effeminate homosexuals, but you must admit that it has a higher proportion of Softies than any in recent memory - even our rampantly heterosexual leader always took the female parts in school plays, and was known by jealous classmates at various points in his education as both \"Emily\" and \"Miranda\". And as we know from the work of artists as varied as Genet, Pasolini and Isherwood, there's nothing like being a Softie oneself to make one admire the thug, the brute and the bully. This sad syndrome is currently a great force in popular culture, as well as in politics. The sorry spectacle of public schoolboys making films about how well-dressed, witty and cool working-class sociopaths are continues with the forthcoming Snatch, the latest film by Guy Ritchie, whose mother is a Lady, whose sister is a Tabitha, and who obviously got that impressive-looking scar by falling off his pony and landing on his silver spoon. </p> <p>In the recent controversy over the naming of paedophiles, it was interesting to see how the Government and its most virulent critics on both left and right combined to speak as one logical, male, middle-class voice to quell the fears (and, covertly, mock the efforts) of a supposedly illogical, mostly female, massively working-class mob. Suddenly, people who have shown nothing but contempt for and mistrust of the police were lecturing the News Of The World and its readers to \"let the police and professionals deal with it\". Is this the same \"inherently racist\" police force that \"bungled\" the Stephen Lawrence case, or is it another lot? </p> <p>The fact is that the contempt shown to anxious parents is part and parcel of the contempt shown to the working class of this country over the past 20 years. For, make no mistake, it is working-class children who are the victims of abduction, assault by strangers and murder; the rest live their lives in a cradle-to-rave bubble of play-dates and people-movers. The lonely death of a raped child in England is in no way less \"political\" than that of an African child by starvation; both are about the triumph of brute force over beauty and innocence. A sensible socialist should have no more scruples about watching the execution of a child murderer than she should have about watching the execution of the heads of the world banks. Not only have the working classes been stripped of their rights at work and in unemployment, they are not even allowed to be fully informed in order to protect their one precious thing - their children - to the best of their abilities. </p> <p> We are told by liberals in law, media and government that we mustn't back any laws that might make paedophiles \"more\" dangerous; we must, it seems, speak soothingly to them, not make any sudden moves and wind them three times a day after meals. But no one ever seems to care about making decent, law-abiding people meaner and nastier, which successive governments' failure to punish evil adequately certainly has done. Seeing how this Government seems tirelessly determined to punish virtue and reward violence has, I'm afraid, turned even me from a rather docile and squeamish individual into a full-on red-mist mentalist, not a day now goes by when I do not imagine what it would feel like physically to injure a member of the current regime. </p> <p>For instance, I cannot see murderers swagger from the Maze, their victims' bodies still lost and unburied, without wanting to shut Peter Mandelson's treacherous hand, which signed the documents that freed them, in a car door, or hear about British bankrolling of yet another bunch of filthy foreign gangsters without feeling a compulsion to put Robin Cook's beard in a mangle and turn it until his eyes pop. On hearing that Lord Irvine had spent \u00a31,528 of public money on two heated towel rails in the same week as the majestic 15p rise for pensioners was announced, I had a brief but pleasing fantasy of tying him, naked, to those same towel rails - one at the front, one at the back - and leaving him like that until his skin came off in strips. And who, on hearing Paul Boateng's quite repulsively posh and priggish voice assuring us that working-class parents have absolutely no need to be informed of active paedophiles in their communities, can honestly say that it would be much of a loss if one day soon he was left to rot in a muddy field somewhere? </p> <p>See what I mean? It's bad, innit? But it's not my fault that society made me like this. Don't make me any angrier, I'm warning you, or I might go underground. At least while I'm writing here, you can keep an eye on me.</p>",
  "<p>When Hitler came to power on January 30 1933 it was obvious that anti-Semitism would spread. For years he had made it plain that he hated the Jews and his stormtroopers had beaten them up in public all over Germany. Most Germans realised what would happen when he won power but, in the easy way that people talk about what might happen in politics, even in Germany, people said it wouldn't last;they believed that the old politicians would control him. They soon found out they were wrong.</p> <p> A law for the reconstruction of the civil service was propagated on April 7 - not voted in; government by parliamentary vote had been abolished in March. Reconstruction of the civil service was a euphemism for dismissing Jews from state appointments; that mattered in academic life because nearly all universities were state run.</p> <p> Germany was ahead of all other nations scientifically. It had won a third of the 99 Nobel prizes for science given before 1933 (Britain had won 18, the US six). Hitler expelled 27 scientists who had, or would later win, Nobel prizes. No country could stand that loss. It was years after Hitler's era before Germany began to win Nobel prizes again.</p> <p> Immediately, rescues were organised from London by the Academic Assistance Council (AAC) created specifically to help German academics. Although the Jewish and non-Jewish political opponents of the Nazis were quickly expelled or intimidated, few had had the chance to make any plans before January 30. There was an exception: a Hungarian physicist born in 1898, Leo Szilard. </p> <p>He came from Budapest but like any ambitious scientist - physicists especially - he made for Berlin, the world centre of his subject. It was not easy. There was active anti-Semitism in Hungary and in Germany he felt the threat was even worse. In the years before Hitler achieved power, Szilard taught himself theoretical physics and even got Einstein to teach him statistical mechanics. He was recognised as a genius even by Einstein, Max Planck, Heisenberg, Nernst, Franck and others in Germany. But he always knew that the situation would not last. He was ready to leave at any time and kept his bag packed and beside him.</p> <p> When he left, he bought a first class ticket to Vienna thinking he was less likely to be taken off the train if he was in first class. He started to make contact with intellectuals outside Germany. He went first to Geneva where he found a famous English professor, William Beveridge, in the same hotel.</p> <p> Szilard's idea was to start a university in exile. Beveridge had thought of it, too, but they soon realised that it would be much more effective to bring refugee scientists to British (and other) universities. Beveridge sent Szilard to London, and Szilard needed no more encouragement.</p> <p> By the time Beveridge returned to London, Szilard had been lent two rooms in the Royal Society (the rooms were small but the address was good). The hospitality had been arranged by Lord Rutherford, President of the Royal Society, the man who split the atom and was a leader in the rescue effort. (The great man said in 1933 that the possibility of using atomic energy for industrial or military purposes was mere moonshine.)</p> <p> Szilard's method of working was unusual. Work for him meant thinking. He stayed in the West End at the Strand Palace Hotel (although he had no money) and every day for a month he soaked in a hot bath all morning, thinking.</p> <p> When not thinking about theoretical physics, he was doing all he could to find places for other refugees, who were coming out of Germany in hundreds. Later many went on to the US, but the immediate rescue operation was based in London and led not only by Beveridge and Rutherford but other distinguished academics, such as AV Hill, biological secretary of the Royal Society.</p> <p> He delighted in tormenting the Nazi scientific establishment, which regarded Einstein's theories and even theoretical physics generally, as Jewish physics. Among all these great men was a characteristic English figure: Tess Simpson, a young law graduate and musician who wanted to do good. She worked as assistant to the director of the YMCA in Geneva - pleasant enough but not fulfilling. So when Szilard offered her the job of secretary of the AAC (at a third of her previous salary) she jumped at it. She stayed for the rest of her life. </p> <p>This Yorkshire lass helped the AAC rescue 2,600 refugees, including the world's greatest scientists, finding them jobs, money and resources. They loved her. Long afterwards, at her 90th birthday party, the two men who proposed her health were both members of the Order of Merit, Sir Ernst Gombrich and Max Perutz, Nobel Laureate. </p> <p> Szilard was waiting for the traffic lights to change in Southampton Row, Holborn, when he suddenly was inspired by the idea of atomic fission and the energy it could release. He made a practical mistake about chain reaction, pursuing the bombarding of beryllium, which does not split, rather than uranium, which does. But he knew the dangerous truth that atomic fission was possible; indeed that its discovery was inevitable. All the facts were widely available and there were still brilliant scientists in Germany, Heisenberg among them; they were as capable as the US or the UK of developing an atomic bomb.</p> <p>Szilard could be a pest. He pestered everyone he knew, and he knew them all, to realise what was happening. When atomic fission was discovered, he urged that there should be no publication of the fact. If the Germans knew about it, there might be no way of stopping them making a bomb. Hitler had ways of persuading scientists to obey him. Most American and British colleagues agreed with Szilard about the need for secrecy, but an important paper was nevertheless published in Paris. </p> <p> Szilard played a crucial role in alerting the US government to the possibilities and dangers of atomic fission. He, with fellow-refugees Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller, persuaded Albert Einstein to write to President Roosevelt on August 2 1939, warning him of what was happening and suggesting that the US government should start to explore the situation. However, the US did little for two years, until it came into the war on December 7 1941.</p> <p> Luckily, none of this mattered. The process of manufacturing a nuclear bomb, especially the need to purify the uranium isotope 235 (which constitutes less than 1% of unrefined uranium) was much more complicated and difficult than was realised. In the end, even the Americans with their vast resources, space and freedom from bombing, did not finish making a bomb until after the end of the war against Germany.</p> <p> Heisenberg and other German atomic physicists were gathered up at the end of the war in Europe and interned in a house near Cambridge, where their conversations were secretly recorded. They were astonished when they heard the public announcement of the dropping of the first atomic bomb on August 6 1945. Heisenberg refused to believe it for a week and, when he repeated his own calculations, realised that he had made a fundamental mistake. The idea that he and the other German scientists deliberately refrained from giving Hitler an atomic bomb, which he would have had no compunction about using, really is mere moonshine.</p> <p> Among those scientists whom Szilard badgered in the US was the notable Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. He had arrived to work in America very stylishly. In December 1938 he went from Rome to Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize, and then, instead of returning to Italy, took a boat to New York. Many of his friends and colleagues were already there and he was made very welcome, as was Niels Bohr, \"the great Dane\", who a few weeks later arrived from Europe with the news that Otto Hahn had achieved fission in Berlin. The effect was electric. All the physicists immediately saw the significance if the event, and some were even said to have left Bohr's lecture before its end to return to their laboratories to confirm the findings. Fermi went to Chicago University, where Szilard joined him.</p> <p> On December 2, 1942 he achieved the first chain reaction . They drank chianti from plastic cups, though hardly in celebration - Szilard said: \"This will go down as a black day in the history of mankind.\" Once a chain reaction - produced in a former squash court under a football stadium in Chicago - had been converted through prodigious effort to the building of a workable atomic bomb, Szilard was against using it, as were nearly all the other physicists involved. They favoured a warning to Japan or a demonstration on an uninhabited island. Many, including Einstein, were horrified that the bomb should be dropped on civilian populations. But it was a political, not a scientific, decision. </p> <p> Szilard was frantic to reach President Truman to persuade him not to use the bomb. So persistent was he that he was even suspected of treachery by General Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project that had developed the bomb. Groves petitioned the secretary for war, Henry Stimson, to dismiss or imprison him. He had Szilard tailed by the FBI - they followed him even to the ceremony where he became an American citizen; the agents reported that he \"speaks occasionally in a foreign tongue\". Stimson was too sensible to pay attention to Groves; but Groves did win the battle to stop Szilard from reaching the president. </p> <p> After the war, Szilard worked for the Pugwash conferences of international physicists, trying to keep atomic energy under civilian control. He moved to Washington to promote arms control, including opening up a hotline to the Soviet Union's Nikita Khrushchev. </p> <p> When he was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1959, he directed his own radiation treatment. Even among the remarkable collection of brains who fled Germany - unique in history - Szilard stands out. Perhaps he might have achieved even more if he had been more consistent and persistent. Some of his colleagues thought just that, but he made so many contributions to the good of the world that it is difficult to fault him; he was an eccentric genius. </p> <p> This article is based on the book, Hitler's Gifts, by David Pyke and Jean Medawar, to be published next month by Richard Cohen Books at \u00a320.</p>",
