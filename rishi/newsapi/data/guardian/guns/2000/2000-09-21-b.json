  "<p>Arsenal found an unlikely goalscoring saviour last night when Martin Keown scored twice in the last six minutes, the second in injury-time, to complete a comeback from two goals down to beat Shakhtar Donetsk. </p> <p>There had been a sense of expectation among the Arsenal fans, not only because they felt Shakhtar would be easily defeated but also because this was the first Champions League match played at Highbury after two unsuccessful seasons at Wembley. </p> <p>The 1-0 win in Prague last week had put the Gunners in a strong position to progress beyond the first group stage and with their players said to be on a \u00a39,000-a-man win bonus per match in this competition they had every incentive to go for the jugular immediately against a Shakhtar team beaten 3-0 by Lazio in Ukraine last week. </p> <p>They began impressively, looking too powerful and pacy for a team who had battled through two qualifying rounds to reach this stage for the first time. Thierry Henry had the ball in the net inside three minutes only to be flagged offside, harshly replays suggested, as he burst on to Nwanwko Kanu's pass. </p> <p>With Patrick Vieira winning tackles and spraying passes from midfield, and Kanu teasing with his skills in attack, it was virtual one-way traffic. Yuri Virt did well to save at his near post when Kanu shot from a tight angle and then he stopped an Henry effort. </p> <p>It was a sign of the task facing a young Shakhtar team, five of whose players were 23 or under, that their experienced captain Sergei Popov was booked for a late, groin-high challenge on Vieira. </p> <p>Robert Pires should have given Arsenal the lead in the 13th minute. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger expects his summer signing to get 10 goals a season, as he has in France for the past five years, and this was a fine opportunity for his first. But, played through by Henry's cute pass, he could only hit the goalkeeper's legs and if there was a danger to Arsenal it seemed to lie in poor finishing, a problem all season, or complacency. </p> <p>Hennadei Zubov offered a warning against the latter, volleying wide after Keown and Silvinho had dithered, but Arsenal were soon back on the offensive. At times they slalomed or jinked past opponents as if they barely existed, and when Vieira fed the shaven-headed Fredrik Ljungberg, Virt had to be quick to block the shot. </p> <p>Shakhtar hail from the mining region of eastern Ukraine and Virt could have done with a hard hat as the shots rained in. Not long after Kanu had sent an effort wide, Henry rattled the bar with a free-kick from 25 yards before the game turned amazingly as Shakhtar scored twice inside four minutes just before the half-hour. </p> <p>The first had a huge element of fortune. David Seaman seemed to have Alexei Bakharev's free-kick covered but the ball took a big deflection off Pires and flew into the opposite corner to the delight of the small but noisy pocket of orange-clad visiting fans. </p> <p>Barely had that claxon-hooting bunch got over the first goal when the second arrived. Sergei Atelkin sent a clever reverse pass between Keown and Oleg Luzhny, playing in place of the injured Tony Adams, and the 21-year-old Ukraine striker Andrei Vorobey neatly shot across Seaman and into the corner for his 11th goal of the season. </p> <p>Suddenly Shakhtar found a new determination and were a threat on the counter-attack as Arsenal took time to find their rhythm again. But the game turned their way just before half-time. </p> <p>First Popov was dismissed after a second booking for checking Vieira as the midfielder tried to burst through on goal. And then Arsenal were awarded a penalty when Sylvain Wiltord, a substitute for Pires, was clattered by Mykhaylo Starostyak as he tried to reach a cross by Dixon. Henry's spot-kick was saved but Wiltord put in the rebound. </p> <p>Arsenal's worried supporters must have expected their team to begin the second half with a welter of attacks. And after briefly struggling as Shakhtar put up to 10 men behind the ball, the chances began to arrive. </p> <p>A brilliant display of close control by Kanu which took him past three players ended with a low shot that fizzed just wide of the far post. Then Henry had an effort saved be fore meeting Silvinho's powerful left-wing cross and sending a back-flick narrowly wide. </p> <p>The Frenchman's aim was no better when he met a Wiltord centre at the near post and flicked it wide of the far one when he might have done better. Barely had Virt recovered from that when he was flinging himself to block from Wiltord. </p> <p>As the levels of frustration at Highbury rose, and with Shakhtar defending in numbers, the introduction of Dennis Bergkamp brought the number of Arsenal strikers to four and represented a last throw of the dice. </p> <p>It seemed Arsenal would pay for several missed chances against a Donetsk side reduced to 10 men just before half-time. But with time running out, Keown first chested in a corner by Bergkamp and then scored from close range from a Kanu cross. Embarrassment avoided then, but only just. </p> <p> <strong> Arsenal </strong> (4-4-2): Seaman; Dixon, Luzhny, Keown, Silvinho; Ljungberg (Bergkamp, 66min), Grimandi, Vieira, Pires (Wiltord, 34); Kanu, Henry. </p> <p><strong> Shakhtar Donetsk </strong> (4-4-2): Virt; Starostyak, Popov, Gleveckas, Shevchuk; Zubov, Tymoschuk, Bakharev (Bielik, 70), Abramov (Kryventsov, 58); Vorobey, Atelkin (Kovalov, 77). </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> H Strampe (Germany).</p>",
  "<p>The recent evidence that Rangers, under Dick Advocaat, may at last be ready to pose a threat in the Champions League suffered no damage from this latest outing. Rangers imposed themselves in the principality last night with a buoyant first half and some stuffy defending after the break, which took them to six points from their opening two games and a commanding lead at the top of Group D. </p> <p>The maturity of Rangers' play was astonishing. In the opening half, after Giovanni van Bronckhorst had given them the early lead, they broke Monaco's will with astute possession football. </p> <p>After the interval, admittedly, Monaco and Marco Simone in particular were fired into life, but Stefan Klos remained unflappable while missiles rained down on him. </p> <p>All this unfolded inside one of European football's ultimate architectural indulgences. The 3,000 Rangers supporters who descended on the Stade Louis II might have felt like time-travellers as, beneath the arena's tall, imperial columns, the normal Monegasque calm was shattered by bawdy Glaswegian chanting. </p> <p>Advocaat came to Monaco and gambled. The most adept striker on Rangers' books, Michael Mols, has been out for a year with injury and still suffers swelling around his right knee whenever he plays. </p> <p>He does, however, possess the knack of being able to guard the ball at his feet despite no end of defensive buffeting, a quality that enhances any team's prospects in the Champions League. Advocaat succumbed and threw Mols in. </p> <p>The other surprise was his decision to play Kerimoglu Tugay, normally a midfielder, as Rangers' sweeper. Tugay has failed to shine at Ibrox since Graeme Souness negotiated his path from Galatasaray, but in recent games he has increasingly shown glimpses of his cleverness. Last night, confronting Monaco's Shabani Nonda and Marco Simone, Tugay excelled in his unfamiliar role. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Advocaat's wildest hopes could hardly have envisaged the start his team grabbed here. </p> <p>From the opening there was something bright and eager about Rangers' approach, and after seven minutes they achieved the equivalent of punching Monaco in the gut. Van Bronckhorst was 25 yards out when his lashing left-foot shot rose barely two feet off the ground, snaking a venomous trail past a startled Stephane Porato's left post. </p> <p>Not suprisingly, the goal injected some urgency into Monaco. But they did not truly threaten Klos's goal until the 41st minute, when Martin Djetou's deflected shot flew dangerously wide of the upright. </p> <p>Rangers, though, and Lorenzo Amoruso in particular, could be grateful for not having conceded a penalty six minutes earlier, when the Italian clearly and recklessly upended Nonda in the box. </p> <p>After the break, the game unwound with a raging energy. By the law of football Rangers, having crafted their first-half lead, faced an inexorable Monaco onslaught. But Klos stood firm, bravely blocking Rafael Marquez's shot from eight yards as the visitors started to impose themselves, and the rugged Amoruso also remained resolute against Nonda's surging runs. </p> <p>Mols, inevitably, did not last the match. The Dutch striker hobbled away after 57 minutes and was replaced by Neil McCann, a player bought by Advocaat in a rare and heartfelt appreciation of Scottish talent. </p> <p>McCann, however, had little say in the remainder of this game, which was dominated by Simone's twisting, tormenting runs and the avalanche of attacks sweeping down on Klos's goal. </p> <p>As Monaco grew increasingly desperate, the match threatened to take on an ugly complexion. When Ian Ferguson was harshly chopped down by Ludo Giuly, Rangers prodded the ball out of play, whereupon Monaco refused to give the ball back and swept up the field. It took Simone, moments later at the corner flag in a show of fair play, to give the visitors back possession. </p> <p> <strong> Monaco</strong> (4-3-3): Porato; Irles, Rodriguez, Marquez, Abidal; Bonnal, Djetou, Riise; Nonda, Giuly, Simone. </p> <p><strong> Rangers</strong> (3-4-3): Klos; Konterman, Tugay, Amoruso; Reyna, Ferguson, Van Bronkchorst, Numan; Johnston, Mols, De Boer. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> A Ouzounov (Bulgaria).</p>",
  "<p>After her departure from BSkyB, her recent appointment on the board of Future Network and promises of a new production company when her baby has arrived, how are things shaping up for Elisabeth Murdoch? And what place will she have in her father's empire?</p> <p>Born on August 22 1968, she is a Leo with her sun on the royal star Regulus, and like all Leos, she has to be boss. Her four-year stint at BSkyB coincided with forceful Mars crossing her Sun. As MD, this was her chance to show her Leo leadership skills, but it was marred by crossed swords with consecutive CEOs. </p> <p>Her horoscope shows a quieter phase as her Sun progresses into Libra, the sign of partnership, and partner Matthew Freud must have a lot to do with this. Her non-executive position at Future Network (April 22 1999) is a catch for this company, with its Sagittarian Ascendant plugging into the current media revolution initiated by the Jupiter-Pluto opposition. But Elisabeth has no obvious astrological connection here, and Future Network is unlikely to be a primary vehicle for her.</p> <p>With a strong Leo-Virgo combination in her horoscope, everything Elisabeth does is well planned. Her hopes for her own production company are expressed in true Leo style. \"I would like to be my own boss, I would like to pick my own team ... do my own thing, pursue my own opportunities, create my own culture and control my destiny\". </p> <p>Not knowing her birthtime, but based on the planets for her day of birth, her horoscope shows networking but little extrovert activity in the next two years. It isn't until June 2003 that it reflects her creative aspirations. Venus makes wonderful connections then to her Leo Sun, and we may at last see a major project that is truly hers. </p> <p>So what of her place in the Murdoch empire? She is a different spirit to her father. In contrast to his fishy Pisces, Elisabeth has no water, and no air either. With mainly opposition contacts between their charts, they have conflicting goals and attitudes, and she must find it impossible to pin him down. Her Venus and Pluto oppose his Sun and Mercury, hinting at the Persephone myth. The beautiful daughter Persephone was pulled down into the underworld (Pluto/Hades), and she lost sight of the sky. </p> <p>Elisabeth's loss of Sky is the point of no return for her, too. She has broken her father's spell and shaken off the burden of being Murdoch's daughter, leaving the field clear for her brothers. When she resurfaces, it must be in her own light. </p> <p>Email the Media Medium at: <a href=\"mailto:maggie@companyguide.co.uk\">maggie@companyguide.co.uk</a></p>",

  "Nicholas Edwards, described as a Jekyll and Hyde character, was convicted of the date rape of 23-year-old Miss D following a landmark ruling by the House of Lords allowing, for the first time, other women to appear in court and also accuse him of past rapes. <p>Police said that he was a dangerous man who had learnt to manipulate the legal system. Without the other women's evidence, the chances of convicting him would have been \"less than average\".</p> <p>Edwards, 39, had been cleared at previous trials of raping most of the women and it was the first time a defendant's previous acquittals had been produced during a trial.</p> <p>Judge Leonard Gerber told the jury: \"You have been party to the making of legal history.\"</p> <p>The jury was told it need not just take Miss D's word that she had not consented to sex with Edwards.</p> <p>Five other women gave evidence, claiming they had been forced into sex - and then Edwards had claimed they were willing partners. </p> <p>Edwards, from Sydenham, south London, had denied raping Miss D and protested it was \"unfair\" that the jury was told about his previous court appearances.</p> <p>Edwards, who boasted he had 2,000 lovers since the age of 12 when he fathered a child, was first accused of rape in 1981. He was convicted of rape twice and cleared of attacking women five times. The various juries were not told of the previous accusations.</p> <p>In the latest case, Miss D said she was raped twice when Edwards tricked her into going to his room after they had been at a south London wine bar in August, 1998.</p> <p>Police believe there are more victims who have been afraid to come forward. Two women have contacted police since the beginning of the trial.</p> <p>Detectives said that Edwards was a serial rapist who calculated what the women would tell police - and \"tailored\" his defence to answer their allegations in court.</p> <p>It was always his word against each woman's. But when Edwards was accused for the eighth time, the Crown Prosecution Service decided to call his bluff and produce the other accusers in court.</p> <p>The case had been taken to the highest court in the land after Old Bailey Judge Leonard Gerber denied the prosecution's application to produce the previous accusers.</p> <p>His judgement was upheld in the Court of Appeal but the Law Lords ruled the evidence could be produced on the basis the defendant was not placed in double jeopardy of being prosecuted again for the same crimes.</p> <p>David Parry, prosecuting, said there were \"striking similarities\" between the crimes, which gave rise to \"exceptional circumstances\" in which previous accusers could give evidence. </p> <p>After the verdict, Detective Sergeant Paul Astvury said Edwards was a \"very dangerous\" man.</p> <p>He added: \"He is very much a threat to women. He is like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde - very charming until he turns into a rapist, then reverts back.\"</p> <p>He praised the women for their \"bravery and courage\" in giving evidence against Edwards.</p> <p>Miss S, one of the women who gave evidence, said outside court: \"Justice has been done.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last week, the photographer who took the famous 1960 shot of the Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara won a landmark case to assert copyright over the snap and claim royalties for its usage. The case had been triggered by the use of the picture in a press ad for a spicy brand of Smirnoff vodka. This had been overprinted with a hammer and sickle motif, with the sickle substituted by a chilli pepper. Alberto Diaz Gutierrez was upset because he felt that the chilli trivialised the historical significance of his photo and its subject, and was awarded a \"substantial\" payment by Lowe Lintas, the London agency which had created the ad. </p> <p>But admen have always liked to use celebrities - especially dead ones - in their advertisements. BA is currently running a 60-second ad which stars a parade of classic figures trooping through the airport lounge. These include Winston Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi and John Lennon, all of whom, says the airline, chose to fly with BA at some stage during their lives. </p> <p>One2One has also recently mounted several TV ads starring, among others, Ian Wright having a \"one to one\" with Dr Martin Luther King, and Kate Moss chatting to Elvis. Classic black and white shots of Audrey Hepburn appear regularly in association with various leading jewellery manufacturers, while Albert Einstein has been used to plug British Gas and numerous other spuriously scientific products. </p> <p>Given the potential difficulties, as highlighted by the Che Guevara lawsuit, why do advertisers use dead personalities? And why are consumers so attracted by these endorsements from beyond the grave? </p> <p>Peter Souter, executive creative director of Abbott Mead Vickers, the UK's biggest advertising agency, says: \"Using celebrities firstly gets your ad noticed, and secondly acts as a shorthand for communication. But if you want to use a big Hollywood star you normally can't get them until they are past their best. The good thing with a dead star is that they are not spoilt. Steve McQueen never got to the stage where he made a bad film, hence he will always be a beautiful, cool young man.\" </p> <p>Charlie Crighton, account director for Ford at Young &amp; Rubicam, also cites the general appeal of famous personalities: \"There is an aspirational nature to celebrities. They automatically have an elevated position, but they can also suddenly achieve cult or legend status when they are dead in a way that they weren't when alive.\" </p> <p>Deciding on which personality to use is the key. Simply bunging any celebrity, dead or alive, into a com mercial alongside a given product is not enough - there has to be a relevance and a neat fit that consumers can appreciate. The cost of using celebrities who have passed away can be high, and not necessarily a cheaper option than using living ones. </p> <p>Bartle Bogle Hegarty, the agency behind the One2One commercials, claims that securing permission to use Luther King and Elvis was almost prohibitively expensive. \"It's not about saving money at all,\" said John O'Keeffe, BBH executive creative director. \"It can be as costly, if not more so, than using living personalities, but it can pay massive dividends.\" </p> <p>Money aside, the advertiser then has to set about seeking permission. Y&amp;R went through long, drawn-out negotiations with McQueen's estate and with Warner Brothers, which made Bullitt, before gaining the right to use the classic footage in its commercial. Similarly, M&amp;C Saatchi, the agency which created the BA \"roll of honour\"ad, jumped through many hoops to secure its stars. </p> <p>Richard Alford, a group account director at M&amp;C, explains: \"The clearances were a lot of work and took over three months to tie up. In the UK, you are allowed to use images of dead people willy-nilly, but we ethically decided to seek full clearance from the estates and trusts for each celebrity we featured. We offered all the estates money, which in fact they gave to charity.\" But as Keith Mathieson, a partner at the leading media law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain explains, there are advantages and disadvantages when using dead celebrities. </p> <p>\"You cannot defame the dead in the UK, so effectively it is easier to use images of dead people than living people,\" he says. \"However, you do have to find out if anyone owns the copyright of an image, then seek permission. If you use it without permission, you are taking a risk because you are potentially infringing copyright.\" </p> <p>This is what Lowe Lintas failed to do with its Smirnoff ad. But agencies have to be wary of using overseas stars: while there is little besides infringement of copyright that can stop the image of a dead UK star being used, elsewhere people's images are more jealously guarded. In fact, there is a veritable industry in the US set up to protect, if not capitalise upon, the commercial use of dead celebrities' images both at home and abroad. </p> <p>But despite the lengthy processes and the possible minefields, many companies and their ad agencies believe using dead celebrities pays off - and customer responses would seem to bear that out. So successful was the Ford Puma ad starring McQueen, for instance, that by the end of 1997 sales of the Puma had achieved a 52% share of the coupe market. Six months after the ad first aired, there was a four-month waiting list. </p> <p>Indeed, the whole business of licensing celebrities, both dead and alive, is one of the hottest growth areas in marketing and has already become a \u00a36bn industry. Next month there will be a dedicated show, Brand Licensing London 2000, at which licensers will be putting thousands of brands, characters and images up for sale to ad agencies, sales promotions agencies and marketing consultants. Everyone from John Lennon to Bing Crosby and Marlene Dietrich will be flogged for potential \"brand extension\". </p> <p>Leysa Kay, the event's director, says: \"This area of marketing has really taken off. The show is in its second year, and it is now four times bigger than in 1999, largely because folk are beginning to realise the potential of cashing in on selling famous people's images. The consumer trend is to buy branded products, whether that be Michael Owen's name on a computer game or a recognised, dead celebrity in the product's associated advertising.\" </p> <p>So whatever next? The Che Guevara lawsuit might have highlighted the potential pitfalls - and the scepticism with which the public should treat these ghostly seals of approval - but so long as advertisers tread warily, it looks like this particular marketing tactic is here to stay.</p>",
  "A Spanish politician has been shot dead in a terrorist attack in a coastal town north of Barcelona. <p>Town councillor Jose Luis Ruiz Casado was walking near his home in Sant Adria de Besos, at 8am local time (6am GMT) today, when he was shot in the back and head.</p> <p>The 42-year-old married father of two died immediately.

  "Gordon Brown failed to persuade the former Treasury minister Geoffrey Robinson not to write his memoirs, although he feared the book would fuel the internal rows undermining Labour's authority. <p>The chancellor put pressure on the millionaire MP for Coventry North West to stay silent and abandon plans to publish his inside story of his time in government and the run-up to the last election. </p> <p>Mr Robinson, a close friend of Mr Brown and a guest at his wedding celebrations on Monday night, refused but did agree to delay publication until after next week's conference at Brighton to avoid overshadowing the event. </p> <p>The release next month of the former paymaster-general's book, The Unconventional Minister, is expected to include his side of the \u00a3373,000 home loan to Peter Mandelson, which cost both men their government posts. </p> <p>Whitehall officials said the chancellor told the prime minister last week that the spate of books on the government was chipping away at its credibility, exposing rifts and concentrating public attention on personalities rather than policies. </p> <p>Journalist Julia Langdon's biography of Mo Mowlam, written with the Cabinet Office minister's cooperation, gave details of the feuds between Labour's most popular figure and Mr Mandelson and Mr Brown as well as her rift with Mr Blair after she was removed from Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Columnist Andrew Rawnsley's version of life in the government has led to Mr Blair and Mr Brown being accused of lying about the \u00a31m donation which the Formula 1 magnate Bernie Ecclestone made to Labour. </p> <p>Mr Blair was interviewed twice by Mr Rawnsley but advisers at No 10 denied he gave the author explosive information or criticised his colleagues. They said the prime minister defended the government's record and presented a picture of a relatively united team. </p> <p>Mr Rawnsley also saw Mr Blair to check information. Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press spokesman, and his assistant, Phillip Bassett, were present taking notes. </p> <p>He interviewed Anji Hunter, the personal assistant to Mr Blair, and the head of the No 10 policy unit, David Miliband. He interviewed Mr Mandelson and his former special adviser, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser. </p> <p>Former senior civil servants, including some in the Treasury, were interviewed. Mr Rawnsley has threatened to reveal sources if he is challenged in the courts or faces a full effort to damage his account. </p> <p>The chancellor's private assessment will be seen as a tacit admission that it was a mistake to give his cooperation to a biography of him two years ago which claimed he still resented Mr Blair inheriting the Labour leadership. </p> <p>Mr Robinson's book is due to be serialised in the Mail on Sunday, which is believed to have paid around \u00a3200,000. </p> <p>Mr Robinson, who was forced to resign shortly before Christmas 1998 after the loan to Mr Mandelson was exposed, is understood to have given up hope of returning as a minister. </p> <p>Mr Blair brought back Mr Mandelson within a year when he handed him Ms Mowlam's Northern Ireland portfolio and put him jointly in charge, with Mr Brown, of Labour's election planning. </p> <p>The Northern Ireland secretary got his version of the loan into print in Donald Macintyre's recently updated biography and is said by associates to fear it could be challenged by Mr Robinson. </p> <p>Downing Street shared Mr Brown's anxiety over Mr Robinson's book and Ms Hunter, a long term aide of the premier, was deputised to keep in close contact with Mr Robinson. </p> <p>The Blair family holidayed in his Tuscan villa and Cannes flat before an offshore trust and \u00a312m inheritance from the car dealer Joska Bourgeois were uncovered. </p> <p>Mr Robinson has also been dogged by allegations about his business dealings and relationship with the former Mirror publisher Robert Maxwell. He was forced to apologise to the Commons for failing to register a directorship, though a police inquiry into fraud allegations at TransTec, the engineering company he formed and which collapsed last year, is understood to have found no evidence against Mr Robinson.</p>",

  "<p>Juan Tom\u00e1s de Salas, who has died aged 62, was the driving force behind modern journalism in Spain. He founded a score of publications, ranging from weekly and daily newspapers to a women's and a motoring magazine, all of which introduced a refreshingly novel way of presenting serious information. More significantly, his newspapers strongly contributed to the spread of democratic values, even during the last years of the Franco regime. It was an achievement certainly not without risk. </p> <p>Born into a middle-class family in the central Spanish city of Valladolid, he studied at the Complutense University of Madrid and began his remarkable career by running an underground newsagency in opposition to Franco. The young law student also tried to oppose the repression of the time through the tiny Frente de Liberaci\u00f3n Popular. He was nearly arrested in 1962 but escaped to the Columbian embassy in Madrid, where he was granted asylum. Eight months later he went into exile in Columbia. </p> <p>In Bogota, De Salas became a columnist for the daily newspaper El Tiempo. Mexican author Carlos Fuentes wrote in the Spanish daily El Pais that De Salas was a pioneer, who spread his warmth and concern and his talent for modern journalism in Latin America. But above all, De Salas wanted to return to Spain. </p> <p>He moved to Paris, the centre of opposition to the Franco dictatorship abroad and as close to Spain as he could be. There he continued his journalistic and political activities and translated Hugh Thomas's book on the Spanish civil war. Then, seven years after his escape, De Salas returned to Spain. He founded a publishing company, Inpulsa, determined to prepare public opinion in Spain for the return of democracy. When, two years later, the regime allowed him to publish his weekly Cambio 16, it was an immediate success, becoming a symbol of the opposition, and a banner of liberal, democratic values. From time to time, Cambio 16 (cambio means change in Spanish and 16 referred to the number of shareholders) was censored - there were heavy fines or the confiscation of entire editions - but this only added to the interest of its growing readership. </p> <p>De Salas wanted his paper to be both \"popular\" and \"serious\". And he achieved it. His monthly, Historia 16, launched six months after Franco died, maintained the same standard, with expert contributions on historic events written for the general public. </p> <p>De Salas' dream, the publication of a daily newspaper, had to wait a little longer. But within a year of Franco's death, Diario 16 conquered the streets with a specially composed song which became a hit. The lyrics expressed a desire for national reconciliation and a liberal and civilised new society. </p> <p>For 17 years he directed Cambio 16, which developed into a keen and lively newspaper. Unfortunately its commercial success did not last. The economic crisis and its consequences, together with internal strife, led to its dissolution. De Salas was forced to resign - debts had risen to \u00a330m - and Diario 16 was put up for sale in 1993. </p> <p>A tall, heavily-built man, de Salas radiated a youthful enthusiasm and natural gusto for the good things of life. He is survived by his Canadian wife, Barbara. </p> <p>Juan Tomas de Salas, journalist, born April 30 1938; died August 22 2000</p>",
  "The messy collapse of the US government's attempt to build an espionage case against an elderly nuclear scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has fractured confidence in the justice department and the FBI. <p>The agency's director, Louis Freeh, is said to be looking for a private sector job, and the affair may also prove to be one disaster too many for the attorney-general, Janet Reno.</p> <p>But the Wen Ho Lee case has had a far more potent and far-reaching effect than a bit of reshuffling in the law enforcement community. It has aroused the wrath of the country's most self-effacing and soft-spoken minority, Asian-Americans.</p> <p>The whole episode may become for Asian-Americans what the Dreyfus case was for French Jews a century ago. In both cases, the elites of their respective communities were jolted out of a complacent optimism over their prospects for assimilation by an outrageous injustice inflicted on one of their own.</p> <p>Alfred Dreyfus was framed as a spy. Wen Ho Lee was simply assumed to be one. He was kept in solitary confinement for nine months, with his hands and feet shackled, while facing 59 national security charges. </p> <p>The press quoted government officials as asserting that the 60-year-old Taiwanese-born scientist was a \"suspected Chinese spy\". But last week, 58 of the charges simply melted away, and Lee was allowed to go home, facing only one count of mishandling classified material.</p> <p>The reaction of many Asian-Americans was instructive. While rejoicing in Lee's release, they were angry about the deal which freed him. </p> <p>In the eyes of many activists, as Chisun Lee pointed out in the New York magazine the Village Voice, the national security establishment escaped by \"not having to address accusations of selective prosecution, racial profiling, xenophobic rhetoric and unconstitutional manoeuvring\".</p> <p>The case and the surrounding furore have helped smash the comfortable assumption that Asian-Americans were by and large allowed to go about their business unmolested in US society. </p> <p>In fact, it turned out that Lee's apparently selective prosecution (there was a list of non-Asians at Los Alamos suspected of similar offences who were never charged) was par for the course for an embattled community. </p> <p>A survey found that over 70% of young Asian-Americans claimed to have been illegally stopped and searched by the police, who had no cause for suspicion other than the colour of the suspects' faces and the shape of their eyes.</p> <p>Before the Lee case there was a cautious confidence among Asian-Americans that the dark days of mass internment during the second world war were long gone and they were beginning to be accepted as ordinary citizens. </p> <p>That confidence has now been punctured. In Time magazine this week, Howard Chua-Eoan observes: \"We are not yet considered part of the American context - our presence is unidiomatic, all too easily aped, too often perceived as too alien to be appreciated as anything other than caricature.\"</p> <p>Although African-Americans have not done nearly as well educationally or economically, they are generally acknowledged by their white neighbours as fellow Americans. That acceptance is far more guarded when it comes to US citizens of Asian extraction.</p> <p>Matt Fong, a Californian Republican running for the Senate two years ago, continually found himself running into the brick wall of racial suspicion on the campaign trail. </p> <p>Even though his family had been Americans for four generations, journalists frequently asked him where his loyalties would lie if China attacked the US.</p> <p>The root of the trouble may be that Asian-Americans are perpetually associated with the \"Chinese threat\" - the only remnant of the Cold War that Americans still take seriously. </p> <p>Lee's arrest stemmed from the belief that the Beijing had managed to steal US weapons secrets, triggering a sense of panic and paranoia in Washington. That belief has since been challenged, and many of the assumptions underlying this seemingly straightforward spy story are being questioned. </p> <p>But however ephemeral the case against Lee may turn out to be, it seems certain to have one lasting consequence - Asian-Americans will now be far less likely to turn the other cheek.</p>",

Universities award coveted places for study. Demand usually exceeds supply by a wide margin. What if merit does not help in the allocation because all applicants are equally deserving or qualified? An alternative worth exploring is chance, the principle of the lottery. </p> <p>Laura Spence is not the only bright young woman who failed to get a coveted university place. Meike Vernooy is another. She was not the victim of mysterious class nuances or cobwebby rituals; far from it. The Dutch woman was rejected by a cold-hearted machine from which as many traces of human influence as possible had been eliminated. In spite of high grades - 9.6 out of a possible 10 - she failed to get a place at medical school in the Netherlands simply because her number did not come up. </p> <p>The Dutch deal with the problem which is now vexing British higher education by lottery. If you get 25 students all with straight A grades applying for five places, how do you choose between them? In Ms Vernooy's case, there were some 6,000 applicants for 1,750 medical school vacancies and the lucky ones were picked by a computerised, random-number lottery. </p> <p>Like Laura Spence's headteacher, Ms Vernooy decided to make a fuss. But the resulting inquiry largely vindicated the system. The Netherlands government appointed a commission headed by Professor PJD Drenth from the Free University of Amsterdam, which modified the lottery but left the principle intact. </p> <p>His work bore out the case made by academics such as Conall Boyle, a statistician who argues that most human ways of choosing between people or projects on a borderline - for example students with equally high grades or single regeneration budget projects with comparable scores on effectiveness and need - are self-deluding. </p> <p>The argument goes back a long way. In 1888 the statistician FY Edgeworth published a mathematical proof that borderline candidates for Cambridge firsts fared no more rationally under the interview system than they would have done in a lottery. The Irish government is now investigating the lottery principle for access to higher education. Professor Drenth's work can be seen at <a href=\"http://www.irlgov.ie/educ\">www.irlgov.ie/educ</a>, commission on the points system, research paper 3. There is a pro-lottery campaign at <a href=\"http://www.turn.to/fairlot\">www.turn.to/fairlot</a> </p> <p>The argument for allocation by lottery is wholly rational; but, paradoxically, we do not want to believe it because of rationality and our faith in the power of the human mind. In his recent study, Random Justice, Neil Duxbury, professor of law at Manchester University, argues that we prefer to have rational deliberations leading to a flawed result rather than an impartial but \"dehumanised\" process which comes up with a better decision. </p> <p>That is because we want \"not right answers but attributable answers - answers for which someone can be held accountable\". What more perfect proof exists than the Laura Spence case, where so much emphasis was placed on finding someone to blame? </p> <p>This explains why Gordon Brown, in criticising Magdalen College, Oxford, hugged A-levels as the great decider, leaving aside such little matters as exam nerves, the debate about continuous assessment and the mysteries of A-level marking. Entry grades are not a reliable predictor of eventual success. The Drenth commission found that Dutch lucky winners with lower grades (within the narrow, top 10% band who are allowed to apply to medical school) regularly finish with better medical degrees than colleagues who started with a bunch of As. </p> <p>That the Dutch lottery applies only to those reasonably similar in attainment may be the key to possible use of lottery methods here. Public doubts are eased if people perceive that those entering the random draw are on an equal footing - the principle of peers which has made random selection of juries for service in court so amazingly long-lasting. </p> <p>There is already a regular lottery for places at oversubscribed state schools in parts of Lancashire, which survived a High Court challenge in 1994. Parents in Burnley and Ormskirk are not exactly happy if their child's number does not come up, but the local authority's random machine is clearly perceived as fairer than moving house to a catchment area or the use of charm and wheedling to get a school place. </p> <p>Other uses might include allocating council houses, charity grants, oil-drilling leases, broadcasting licences (remember the farce of Mrs Thatcher's commercial television allocations?), tickets for big events, distribution of scarce medical resources, conscription (the Vietnam draft in the US was lottery-based). Even MPs enter a lottery for private members' bills. Tied elections are decided on the spin of a coin. </p> <p>Lotteries have had their day in court. In the case of the US v Holmes (1842) judges accepted the lot as the fairest way of organising cannibalism among shipwreck survivors. In the 70s the Kerista commune in San Francisco maintained \"polyfidelitous\" relationships through a regular draw to allocate sexual partners. </p> <p>Allocation by price - as in the sale of broadband communications - may be appropriate in some circumstances. But in others - in the civic context, dealing with focus groups, citizens' juries and other facets of democracy - there are plenty of opportunities for experimenting with lottery. It would be satisfying to choose a particularly appropriate one: wouldn't a hat and two straws decide between Camelot and Branson as well as Dame Helena Shovelton and the lottery commission? Why not some experiments in dishing out grants for charitable purposes or public appointments for service on quangos, where applicants are more or less equal and the present system of choosing in question? </p> <p> Martin Wainwright is the Guardian's northern editor; he is chair of Yorkshire and the Humber regional advisory panel of the National Lottery Charities Board </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.wainwright@theguardian.com\">martin.wainwright@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "People are always going on about how a good film relies on a good script, but ask them to name a few screenwriters, even Oscar-winners like Edward Anhalt, who has died aged 86, and they are lost. Mind you, the burly Anhalt, who worked on Elia Kazan's classic Panic In The Streets, Peter Glenville's Becket and Edward Dmytryk's The Young Lions, seemed happy to accept that writers were at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. He claimed not to have worked too hard at his craft. \"He lived for a great martini,\" remarked his daughter, Julie Anhalt Rice. <p>When Anhalt was under contract to Paramount from 1961 to 1965, he devised a way of dealing with Hal Wallis, the head of the studio, who would roam the corridors of the writers' building listening for sounds of creativity. Anhalt simply played a tape of the sound of a busy typewriter whenever Wallis passed by. His Oscar-winning Best Screenplay, written under Wallis's aegis, was Becket (1964), rather deftly adapted from Jean Anouilh's chronicle play, though the characters, Thomas \u00e0 Becket (Richard Burton) and King Henry II (Peter O'Toole), were revealed more through talk than action. </p> <p>His less prestigious work for the studio included the Elvis Presley vehicle Girls! Girls! Girls! (1962), in which the star played a poor tuna fisherman, and Boeing Boeing (1965), which Anhalt fashioned from Marc Camoletti's farce for Tony Curtis and Jerry Lewis. Also based on a play, but more personal for Anhalt, was Wives and Lovers (1963), about a successful writer (Van Johnson) on the brink of divorce. </p> <p>Anhalt was married to his first wife Edna for 20 years, during which time they were writing partners. They began by churning out short stories for pulp magazines, under the pseudonym of Andrew Holt, and their first screenplay, credited to Holt, was Strange Voyage (1946), a lively \"B\" adventure directed by Irving Allen. </p> <p>In 1950, under their real names, the Anhalts' won an Academy Award for Original Story for Elia Kazan's gripping urban thriller, Panic in the Streets, about the hunt for a gang of petty criminals carrying pneumonic plague. The couples' screenwriting breakthrough came with Fred Zinnemann's The Member of the Wedding (1952), adapted from Carson McCullers' successful Broadway play. It contained an \"opened-out\" sequence, not in the play, in which unhappy, reclusive adolescent Julie Harris goes to town and is pestered by a drunken GI. The film was produced by Stanley Kramer, for whom the couple continued to work. </p> <p>Their Oscar-nominated story for Edward Dmytryk's taut psychological police drama The Sniper (1952), about a man who shoots women from rooftops, was based on research they did among men who were convicted of violent crimes against women. Anhalt later revisited similar territory with the much slicker The Boston Strangler (1968). </p> <p>It was while writing the script for Kramer's first directorial effort, the laboured medical drama Not as a Stranger (1955), based on Morton Thompson's thick bestseller, that the Anhalts began to battle with Columbia Studios and each other, leading to their divorce. </p> <p>The last film Edward and Edna worked on together was Kramer's sprawling 130-minute epic, The Pride and the Passion (1957), for which they provided the empty rhetorical dialogue delivered without conviction by the miscast trio of Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra and Sophia Loren. </p> <p>Anhalt's first solo screenplay was for Dmytryk's The Young Lions (1958), based on the second world war novel by Irwin Shaw. On Marlon Brando's insistence, Anhalt had to soften the Nazi character, but the writer was instrumental in getting Dean Martin cast in his first non-comic role. In Love and War (1958) also contrasted the effects of the second world war on three soldiers, but this time in a soap opera manner. Even more sudsy was The Restless Years (1958), a Peyton-Place type story featuring blonde teen idol Sandra Dee, and The Sins of Rachel Cade (1961) starring Angie Dickinson as an African missionary. Juvenile delinquency was the fashionable theme of John Frankenheimer's The Young Savages (1961), with a banal message rammed home about social conditions, but at least co-writer Anhalt got to grips with more realistic dialogue. </p> <p>In his effective screenplay for Hour of the Gun (1967), directed by John Sturges, Anhalt (who appears briefly as a medic) takes up the Western story after the gunfight at the OK Corral, giving it a bitter, violent tone, making Wyatt Earp (James Garner) a cold-blooded killer and Doc Holliday (Jason Robards) ever more whisky-sodden. Another Western, which gained Anhalt a Western Hall of Fame award, although co-written with John Milius, was Sydney Pollack's Jeremiah Johnston (1972). The best of the cycle of \"wilderness\" movies of the early 70s, it starred a hirsute Robert Redford as a trapper trying to survive in the mountains, where hostile Indians lurk. Much of Anhalt's later work was done for TV, including the fourth (updated) version of the melodrama Madame X, in which the writer appeared as a judge, and in which his third wife Camilla Carr had a role. </p> <p>He is survived by his fifth wife, Huguette Patenaude, and his daughter. </p> <p>Edward Anhalt, screenwriter, born March 28 1914; died September 3 2000</p>",
  "<p>Greenpeace's executive director and 27 other environmental activists were yesterday cleared of causing criminal damage to a field of genetically modified maize, in a verdict with profound implications for the future of GM crop trials and direct action. </p> <p>Lord Melchett and his fellow protesters, 13 of whom also work for Greenpeace, were acquitted at a retrial at Norwich crown court after claiming they had lawful excuse to attack the crop at a farm in Lyng, Norfolk, in July 1999. </p> <p>The not guilty verdicts were greeted with cries of delight and tears from some of the defendants and applause from the gallery. Outside some defendants were congratulated by jury members. </p> <p>At the original trial in April the 28 were cleared of theft, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict on criminal damage charges after seven and a half hours. </p> <p>The defendants, who include a Baptist minister, a beautician and the caretaker from Greenpeace's London office, were awarded costs for both trials. The total cost to the crown prosecution service was estimated at \u00a3250,000. </p> <p>Speaking outside the court, Lord Melchett said the verdict sent a clear message to the government. \"The time has come for Mr Blair and the chemical companies to stop growing GM crops. </p> <p>\"We have known for a long time that people don't want to eat GM food; supermarkets won't sell GM food and now the time has come for people to stop planting GM food.\" </p> <p>He said the verdict did not give a green light to other protesters to destroy crops, but refused to rule out similar action by Greenpeace in the future. </p> <p>\"The next step is for the government to take action. We don't have immediate plans, but if the government don't do anything and the chemical companies don't stop planting these crops, we won't rule anything out.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of the Environment said the crop trials would continue. \"If we halted our strictly controlled research then there would be widespread GM crop planting without us getting the evidence we need,\" he said. \"Our top priority is to protect the environment and human health.\" </p> <p>Seventy three sites were chosen for crop trials this year and already 12 spring-sown oilseed rape crops, 12 forage maize crops and 24 beet crops have been harvested. Twenty five sites are being planted with GM autumn-sown oilseed rape. </p> <p>Under EU law the government has no plans to ban GM crop planting, but the biochemical companies have agreed to take part in a four-year trial programme, now in its second year. </p> <p>William Brigham, the farmer on whose land the GM maize was grown, said the verdict gave \"the green light to trespass and the green light to vandalism\". </p> <p>\"This attack was a frightening experience for myself and my family,\" he said. \"Greenpeace is a massive environmental pressure group and we are a small family farm. They used bully boy tactics to get their point across and today the bully has won.\" </p> <p>Scimac, the industry body which represents Aventis, the biotech company which developed the GM maize on Mr Brigham's farm, also condemned the verdict. </p> <p>\"This raises concerns that go much deeper than the safety of GM crops,\" its chairman, Roger Turner, said. \"It raises fundamental questions about the ability of our legal system to cope with the gradual erosion of respect for public rights and authority. </p> <p>\"We are disappointed that an extreme minority do not have enough confidence in the strength of their argument to let science decide.\" </p> <p>Mike Schwarz, a partner at Bindman and Partners, the solicitors who acted for Greenpeace, said the verdict was a vindication of the jury system. \"Juries understand reasonable citizens' actions. But to get to juries you have to get past police forces keen to clamp down on protesters and a CPS which wants to keep these cases in magistrates courts and away from juries.\" </p> <p>The verdict provoked anger from the National Farmers' Union, which described it as \"perverse\" and as declaring \"open season\" on farmland. </p> <p>The NFU's president, Ben Gill, said he would be writing to the home secretary, Jack Straw, ahead of a planned meeting to discuss the issues raised by the case. </p> <p>\"We find it extraordinary that even with such clear evidence a not-guilty verdict was reached,\" he said. \"This gives the green light to wanton vandalism and trespass.\" </p> <p>Peter Tidey, chief crown prosecutor for Norfolk, defended the decision to bring a retrial. \"Criminal damage is a serious offence and allegations that an offence was premeditated and carried out by a group of people are taken into consideration when deciding whether to proceed,\" he said. </p> <p>The attack on Mr Brigham's crop took place at dawn on the July 26 last year when the 28 protesters, 19 men and nine women aged between 22 and 52, converged on his farm. </p> <p>Dressed in white overalls with the Greenpeace logo on the back and accompanied by four journalists including a video cameraman, the group set about removing the entire six and a half acre crop. </p> <p>They had brought with them a tractor with a cutting device and a tipper truck. \"I was there with the intention of removing the entire crop, of bagging it and returning it to its owners, AgrEvo Ltd [now Aventis] in King's Lynn,\" Lord Melchett told the court. </p> <p>The aim of removing the entire crop was crucial to the defence case. The protesters argued that they had lawful excuse under the Criminal Damage Act 1971 to uproot the crop, as leaving it to flower and pollinate would have led to a greater crime - the contamination of other crops in the vicinity. \"We are delighted the jury agreed with us,\" Lord Melchett said. </p> <p>Greenpeace targeted the maize on Mr Brigham's land after he gave an interview to the Eastern Daily Press in which he said he would be growing the crop under contract for AgrEvo. </p> <p>The publicity prompted villagers in Lyng to hold a public meeting to discuss the crop trial. Mr Brigham was invited but, on the advice of AgrEvo, did not attend. </p> <p>Following the meeting, Lord Melchett wrote to him urging him to discontinue the trial. Shortly afterwards the farmer gave an interview to Farmers Weekly in which he indicated that the maize was due to flower within a week. This prompted Greenpeace to carry out its action. </p> <p>\"That crop, when it flowered, would release GM material widely,\" Lord Melchett said. It posed \"the most serious environmental threat... it's alive, so it can't be cleared up like chemical pollution, or even nuclear waste.\"</p>",
  "<p>The conciliatory tone of the new chief of the International Monetary Fund yesterdayy as he welcomed delegates to IMF and World Bank meetings in Prague fell on deaf ears as protesters gathered to demonstrate against globalisation. </p> <p>Some 18,000 bankers, finance ministers and government officials will be struggling through barricades to try to debate reform of the financial system, the ailing euro, the need for more international trade liberalisation, and ways of speeding up debt relief to the poorest countries. </p> <p>But they will be matched by around 20,000 protesters for whom the annual meeting of the IMF and its sister organisation, the World Bank, symbolises everything that is wrong with globalisation - its domination by the rich and powerful, its lack of concern for the poor, and its disregard for the environmental consequences of unfettered growth. </p> <p>Horst K\u00f6hler, the new managing director of the fund, is presenting himself as its new caring face, concerned about globalisation's downsides as well as its opportunities. Yesterday he described the organisation as an \"open institution\" which learns from \"experience and dialogue\". </p> <p>But Ann Pettifor, the director of Jubilee 2000, the coalition campaigning for cancellation of unpayable third world debts, describes the fund and the bank as the last great communist banks, unaccountable either to the markets or to western taxpayers who ultimately foot the bill for their lending. </p> <p>The group of seven industrialised countries, which controls nearly half the votes on the IMF's board, is able to direct the destinies of the poor countries who are the fund's main clients but control less than 2% of votes. </p> <p>As far as the fund is concerned, the world economy has come through the financial crises of 1997 and 1998 and is now in good shape. All that is needed for the rosy scenario to continue is for a little less growth in the US and a little more in Japan and Europe to take up the slack. While accepting that some mistakes were made during the crises, it broadly believes that globalisation - the greater integration of the world economy by breaking down barriers to trade and movements of capital - is a force for good. </p> <p>For the protesters, by contrast, the problems in Indonesia and Russia were symptomatic of a financial system that is inherently unstable, just as the moves to open up trade shows the indifference of big business to the environment, and the sluggish pace of debt relief illustrates a lack of concern for the poor. </p> <p>Chastened by the chaotic scenes in Seattle last December, when talks aimed at launching new trade negotiations collapsed amid violent scenes on the streets, the fund and the World Bank are trying to show that they are listening to protesters. Last week the bank released its world development report, which stressed that growth had to be accompanied by policies to remove inequality, tackle corruption and promote democracy. </p> <p>Jessica Woodroffe, head of campaigns at the World Development Movement (WDM), said that while the fund's new head might be talking a different language, on the ground it was business as usual. </p> <p>The fund is accused by the WDM and other non governmental organisations of giving poor countries hundreds of hurdles to jump before they can have their debts written off by western creditors. They include unpopular budget tightening measures and complex privatisations. </p> <p>\"Holding up debt relief because a country has not privatised its cotton or copper industry is absurd,\" said Ms Woodroffe. \"It is nothing to do with ensuring debt relief is spent on poverty reduction but everything to with the IMF forcing countries to fit its Jurassic economic models.\" </p> <p>Western politicians have been caught unawares by the way in which the protesters have used new technologies - particularly the internet and the mobile phone - to organise themselves. </p> <p>But unlike the fuel tax protesters who brought Britain to a halt last week, the ragtag army flooding into Prague lacks a defined programme. The bank and the fund hope that, in the absence of positive ideas that engage with the broad mass of voters, the demonstrations will eventually peter out. </p> <p>Clare Short, the international development secretary, says that the destruction of the fund, the bank and the World Trade Organisation would not help the poor, but simply leave them at the mercy of truly unregulated capitalism. Progressives, she believes, should instead try to reform the institutions. </p> <p>But so far, Ms Short's arguments have made little headway. The success of the protesters in shutting down Seattle has meant that every subsequent international meeting has seen a standoff between demonstrators and the police. Prague offers the first real opportunity for anti-globalisation groups in Europe to protest and they intend to make the most of it. </p> <p>\"We want to make the financiers' lives as difficult as possible in Prague and disrupt their meeting,\" said Viktor Piorecky, a spokesman for Inpeg, an umbrella group organising many of the 200 planned demonstrations and gatherings. </p> <p>\"We don't consider the IMF and World Bank to be legitimate institutions and they don't have the right to have meetings somewhere and decide about other people's lives,\" he added. </p> <p>Amid concern that violence will erupt, schools in Prague will close and businesses will shut for the duration of the meetings. Even Prague's taxi drivers, normally eager to take advantage of outsiders, have decided to take a holiday. </p> <p>For the Czech authorities, hosting the fund and bank meetings has turned into something of a nightmare. The gathering of the great and good of international finance was supposed to showcase the country, the first former communist regime to host the event, and to reveal how far it had come in the decade since the fall of the Berlin wall. </p> <p>\"The government will certainly respect the right of demonstrators to express their views about these organisations, but it will not respect any right to violent protest actions,\" the prime minister, Milos Zeman, said last week. </p> <p>But now there are fears that the face presented to the world will be of the old Czechoslovakia, with police crush ing protests as they did in 1968, rather than of the new Czech Republic, plugged into the market-driven global economy.</p>",
  "The Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, flew to an army base in Montenegro yesterday to denounce his opponents as \"rabbits, rats and even hyenas\" and warn the west not to interfere in elections on Sunday, which the opinion polls indicate that he cannot win. <p>Scores of Mr Milosevic's critics have been detained and with tension rising the chief opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, has warned that the president could use fraud to stay in power. Western governments fear he will use the army to crush protests if he is declared the winner. A US aircraft carrier is being sent to the Adriatic. </p> <p>It was Mr Milosevic's first visit to Montenegro - which with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia - since he became federal president three years ago. His helicopter brought him to the rally near the town of Berane, within 15 miles of Kosovo, where Nato-led troops could have arrested him on war crimes charges brought by the Hague tribunal last year. </p> <p>The republic of Montenegro is deeply divided and its pro-western government, led by Milo Djukanovic, is boycotting the Yugoslav election. A former Serbian information minister, Aleksandar Tijanic, warned that Mr Milosevic was preparing to arrest the Montenegrin president. </p> <p>Mr Djukanovic said last night that Montenegro would defend itself if Mr Milosevic provoked a military clash. Speaking to Russian television, he said: \"If Milosevic decides to provoke a military conflict with Montenegro, we would have no choice but to defend our freedom.\" </p> <p>A US navy spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that the aircraft carrier George Washington would arrive in the Adriatic from the Persian Gulf on about September 30. \"This is much the normal tour of duty,\" the spokeswoman said. \"There hasn't been a carrier in the Adriatic for about three or four months and the George Washington is on its way back to the Atlantic.\" </p> <p>Mr Milosevic yesterday told a crowd of 10,000 supporters bussed in from nearby towns: \"Our country is the focus of much attention from the world's strongest nations, as if mankind has no other worries but how ... Serbs and Montenegrins will govern their joint state.\" Many in the crowd shouted \"Slobo, Slobo\" and \"We are all Yugoslavia\". </p> <p>He has clamped down on the independent media and ordered police to confiscate computers and other material from Serbian election monitoring groups. Under the law, independent observers have no right to enter polling stations or attend the count. </p> <p>Despite the pressures, the opposition has done remarkably well by uniting behind Mr Kostunica, a Belgrade lawyer, Only the maverick Serbian Renewal Movement is running a separate candidate. An opinion poll by the Belgrade-based Strategic Marketing agency gave Mr Kostunica 32.5% of the vote to Mr Milosevic's 26.6%. The Centre for Policy Studies gave Mr Kostunica 41% to Mr Milosevic's 20%. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic has support in rural areas and has manipulated the campaign through control of state television. State controls on the price of staple goods have also cushioned the realities of a weak economy. But years of war and corruption at the top have disillusioned many urban voters. </p> <p>Warning of vote rigging, Mr Kostunica told a rally at the weekend: \"They are bullies, liars and thieves and have stolen years of our lives and dignity. Now they are preparing to steal the elections\". </p> <p>Mr Milosevic could cheat by falsifying votes from Kosovo. The UN has allowed the poll to go ahead there but will not be running or supervising it. In the last Serbian presidential elections as many as 200,000 Albanians supposedly voted for Mr Milosevic's right-hand man. Because of the boycott in Montenegro, Mr Milosevic can also steal votes which are cast in army camps and town halls run by the pro-Belgrade party. </p> <p>The EU has offered to lift sanctions if the election \"leads to democratic change\". The wording was chosen with care as the Yugoslav constitution is so ambiguous it could allow Mr Milosevic to serve out his term until next July, even if the opposition wins. But most observers believe he is more likely simply to declare victory and hope to ride out - or shoot out - any protests.</p>",
  "It is not a good time to be a nun. Yesterday, Sister Alphonso's demure features were in virtually every newspaper following her conviction in Aberdeen for abusing and humiliating children. Meanwhile, around the globe in India, the distinctive, white-veiled nuns of Mother Teresa's order were under a similar spotlight. A criminal case has been filed against a Sister Francesco for forcing a girl's hand onto a hot plate used for cooking chapatis. Nor are these two isolated events. In Australia and Ireland, many cases have come to light of nuns abusing children. The impression builds up that the Catholic church is riddled with abusing nuns and paedophile priests. <p>The reality appears to be that the proportion of nuns and priests who abuse children is roughly in line with the general population. But that does nothing to diminish the sense of outrage which lingers around cases such as those in Aberdeen and Calcutta. </p> <p>There is a double shock in the idea that a nun could be capable of the kind of cruelty Sister Alphonso meted out to her charges. First, we have been very slow to accept that women are capable of abusing children. It flies in the face of some of our most powerfully held emotional beliefs of women as caring mothers. Female physical aggression has been erased from our image of the \"gentler sex\", because it is on that caring mother image that all of our emotional security is built. If we accept that women can be violent, especially towards children, we have to accept the world as an unsteadier, more dangerous place. </p> <p>Second, Sister Alphonso is a a nun and until a couple of decades ago, we presumed that the lives of religious women and men reflected something, if not all, of their intense idealism. We believed some of what priests and nuns purported to be: altruistically devoted to the wellbeing of others. </p> <p>It is precisely this intense idealism which is often at the root of the problem, argues Andrew Samuels, professor of analytical psychology at the University of Essex. If someone makes enormous psychological investment in the idealistic aspirations of selflessness, the tensions between the ideal and the reality can sometimes cause a brittleness which can lead to a nun or priest snapping and losing all control, with terrifying consequences. Samuels, a Jungian, argues that every professional vocation has its \"shadow side\". A well-integrated individual is able to understand and manage the destructive shadow side, someone who is emotionally repressed cannot. The shadow side of teaching is the desire to control, he adds. </p> <p>Control and loss of it is clearly the theme of Sister Alphonso's sad story. In her trial, she complained of too many children to care for, and too few staff. Faced with this pressure, she lost control as her accusers described, with appalling consequences. Her fury and exasperation were expressed as a desire to humiliate - children who wet their beds had their soiled underwear tied around their heads - and to hurt. </p> <p>She has clearly damaged the lives of many people. But her stoical account of her own background is also tragic. As the youngest of 12 children (seven of whom died in infancy), she pulled down her knickers when she had done wrong and asked her father to beat her. During the trial, she used that tell-tale phrase \"I wanted for nothing\" with its connotations of being materially but not emotionally provided for. Brought up on humiliation and deprivation, it is no wonder that she knew how to dispense it. </p> <p> This pattern crops up frequently in the current abuse charges against the church, and perhaps it will in India as more details emerge. For poor children (be they Irish or Indian Untouchables) the Catholic church offered the chance of a decent education and a secure material future. The church's culture of suffering, asceticism and emotional deprivation was already deeply familiar to deprived children and they, in their turn, reinforced it. What ensured that this was never challenged was the church's bid to empire-build. Quantity not quality: the church wanted more and more children and they wanted them to get a Catholic education and be in Catholic orphanages. </p> <p>The overriding memory of my convent education was a group of women who made no bones about not wanting to look after children. It always puzzled me that women who had chosen not to have children should end up looking after other people's. The nuns at my convent were not actively cruel, simply indifferent to the dozens of young girls who were desperate for sympathy, interest and affection. The emotional disengagement and evident fear of sexuality was very damaging to some vulnerable girls. </p> <p>We are fascinated by the idea of nuns who abuse and horrified at their failings. We are angry with them, not just for what they did to the children but because they claimed to be something different and have disappointed us. We need to believe in saints. Mother Teresa was hugely popular: we wanted to believe that she was holier than us. </p> <p>In a lesser measure, if nuns as the archetypal figures of selfless virtue have fallen, then anyone can; we have no faith in virtue left, we see only hypocrisy and failings - and that makes us very angry. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com&quot;\">madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com </a></p>",
  "<p>A mythical landscape of snow- covered fantasy, Lapland is inhabited by Santa Claus and his team of industrious elves creating colourful gadgets for the world's children. Finland, the country on whose peninsula the real Lapland perches is actually inhabited by Nokia and a constellation of inventive, mobile technology companies developing the next generation of colourful gadgets for the world's grown-ups. </p> <p>In less than ten years Finland has moved at a meteoric pace from a country dependent on the export of paper and pulp for the majority of its GDP to one which is leading the world in cutting edge mobile internet and phone technologies. </p> <p>It is more than a little ironic that such an economy should spawn the very technology tipped to eliminate dependence on and demand for paper. Stranger still is that - just as the mobile internet is on the verge of changing how we do business for ever - the paper industry in Finland is running at optimum. </p> <p>In a staggeringly short period of time, Helsinki has emerged as the centre of the next big technological revolution. We may not be writing the epitaph for paper just yet, but the script for the true impact of mobile communications is being written before our eyes. </p> <p>Sixty-five per cent of Finland's population owns a mobile phone - the largest penetration in the world. It also has the cheapest rates for telephone calls in Europe. </p> <p> For the Finns, internet banking is taken for granted, text messaging is a national pastime and acting as the world's mobile technology laboratory is as natural as snow in winter. </p> <p>Multinationals, like IBM, are rushing to invest in Finnish start-ups. In just two years the country has gone from having a handful of venture capitalist firms specialising mainly in engineering to attracting hordes of hi-tech investors eager to back the next big thing. </p> <p>Mika Nieminen, founder and chief executive of m-commerce software developer More Magic, estimates that the amount of venture capital chasing a home in m-commerce is around $3bn. </p> <p>More Magic predicts that transactions made through mobile handsets could be worth upwards of $50bn by 2004. </p> <p>Even Sonera, the long established Finnish national telephone company, is diversifying into the mobile internet portal market and is aiming to be a global player thanks to m-commerce. They put the mobile boom down to \"A telecom friendly government\". </p> <p><strong> Wireless community</strong><br> </p> <p> A receptive business and legal climate, and a small but technophile population, makes Finland the ideal market to develop and pilot new and experimental technologies. In Arbianranta, a quiet stretch of industrial park in a corner of Helsinki, something remarkable is taking \"shape in the form of the \"virtual village\". </p> <p>The theory goes that in the virtual village wireless and broadband technology will allow you to turn your home appliances on before you get home. If you want to pick up some shopping on the way there you can check the inventory of the local shop to see if it has what you want, order it and pay for it before you get there. If you need a taxi don't bother telling it where to pick you up. Your sim card in your mobile phone is connected to the village network and a digital map will tell the taxi firm your exact location. </p> <p>In practice all this happens in the virtual village. The brainchild of Digia, a Helsinki-based wireless software developer, the village sprang into life after a $1bn investment from Helsinki city council and blue chip partners including, IBM, Nokia, Symbian and Sonera. Within five years, say the Finns, the village will be the world's first truly wireless community. </p> <p><strong> Old models redundant</strong><br> </p> <p> When fully operational it will be the test centre for cutting-edge experimental mobile technologies. More than this, however, it will act as a laboratory for testing new business models to accompany the technology. Founder and chairman of Digia, Pekka Sinonen says: \"The village will help identify business models from the processes in everyday life.Behaviour will drive technology. Not the other way round.\" </p> <p>Mr Sinonen claims the old model of inventing the technology and then trying to find a suitable business or commercial application for it will be redundant. The village, he says will produce an organic method for developing less risky business models and strategies. It is all made possible by smart phones, the next generation mobile phones equipped with a Psion-designed operating system.The smart phone is your PC, palm pilot, phone and personal organiser rolled into one. It will be faster, more versatile and user-friendly than any previous technology. It will be the physical embodiment of technological convergence. </p> <p>It is this new age of mobile technology which will make money for global brands like Nokia in the future. But it will also facilitate the growth of m-commerce for new and old business alike.</p>",
  "A young policeman has died after injecting himself with heroin in what is believed to have been a first time experiment. <p>PC Paul Weir, who had been with Greater Manchester police for just under three years, was found dead on Monday night, next to a note with instructions on how to take drugs intravenously. </p> <p>Officers found heroin and drug taking equipment next to the body of the 25-year-old policeman at his home in Audenshaw, Tameside. </p> <p>His colleagues at Elizabeth Slinger road station in Withington, Manchester, expressed their shock at his death. </p> <p>Chief Superintendent Lil King, the commander of south Manchester division, paid tribute to PC Weir. </p> <p>She said: \"He has been described by his colleagues and superior officers as a mature officer with bags of common sense, who regularly showed his courage, determination and a tremendous sense of humour. </p> <p>\"He was an astute and capable officer who dealt with many serious crimes and his arrest rate was high.\" </p> <p>PC Weir's parents, who live in Botswana, have flown to Manchester after learning of their son's death. </p> <p>Police investigators are trying to establish how PC Weir got hold of the drug, but one line of inquiry will check on confiscated drugs. </p> <p>It is understood that the officer had been deeply affected by the death of a pensioner in February. He was the first on the scene after the murder of Violet Higgins, who had suffered facial and head injuries. </p> <p>She was discovered with the body of her husband, Michael, who had Parkinson's disease and had apparently committed suicide. </p> <p>Two days before his sudden death, PC Weir had proposed to his girlfriend, Stephanie Percival, and the couple had planned to marry. </p> <p>Greater Manchester police refused to speculate on the cause of his death until the results of a postmortem examination were known.</p>",
  "Hillary Clinton dodged a cloud lingering over her campaign for a seat in the senate yesterday when the six-year Whitewater real estate investigation found insufficient evidence for criminal charges against her or the president. <p>But Robert Ray, the independent counsel whose inquiry cost a record $52m, stopped well short of saying there was nothing to the allegations. \"This office has determined that the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that either president or Mrs Clinton knowingly participated in criminal conduct or had any knowledge of criminal conduct,\" he said. </p> <p>Mrs Clinton said: \"I am confident that not only have New Yorkers and Americans made up their minds, but there's nothing to the report.\" </p> <p>Mr Ray's work was submitted to a panel of three judges and its contents will not be known in full for at least three months, well after election day in November. </p> <p>A White House spokesman said: \"Robert Ray is now the latest investigator to complete an examination into the transactions related to the Whitewater Development Co and conclude that there are no grounds for legal action.\" </p> <p>While the main part of Mr Ray's investigation is now over, he is still considering whether to bring criminal charges against President Clinton in connection with the Monica Lewinsky affair. A grand jury has been empanelled in Washington and no decision will be made until after Mr Clinton has left office. </p> <p>Fourteen other people were convicted in the course of the inquiry into the Clintons' failed real estate operations in Whitewater in 1978, including their friend Webster Hubbell and a former governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker. </p> <p>Mrs Clinton's role, including the question of whether she helped to make documents disappear, was at the centre of Mr Ray's endeavours. Whitewater was to have been a holiday complex dominated by time-share units but the deal collapsed when a local bank owned by the Clintons' part ners, James and Susan McDougal, failed. </p> <p>The investigation into possible criminal conduct by the Clintons and McDougals began in 1994 when the attorney general, Janet Reno, appointed Kenneth Starr, Mr Ray's predecessor, to look into whether the partnership broke the law as it tried to keep the project alive. </p> <p>Mr Clinton, clearly suspi cious of the timing of the Ray report's findings seven weeks before his wife's date with the electorate, said: \"I think people can draw their own conclusions about that. I think it's pretty obvious.\" </p> <p>It was not until recently that Mrs Clinton opened up a lead over her Republican opponent, the previously obscure Long Island congressman Rick Lazio.</p>",
  "<p>He works 10 hours a day, makes more than \u00a370,000 a year, doesn't bother to take holidays, dresses as he pleases, has never been happier and is looking for another job. This 33-year-old, white, university-educated creature is, according to the first comprehensive survey of the industry, the typical internet worker. </p> <p>There is also a reasonable chance that his employer will arrange his dry cleaning, allow him to bring his dog to work, offer him free massages and give him stock options. And he still thinks people in other firms are doing better. </p> <p>The profile of the typical internet employee has emerged from a survey carried out by the Industry Standard, the San Francisco-based news magazine of the internet economy. The typical worker, it appears, not only enjoys an income about three times the national average but also has the gall to enjoy himself. </p> <p>Currently 2.5m people are employed by internet firms in the US and the results of the survey give plenty of reasons why so many people believe that the grass is indeed greener in Silicon Valley.

The respondents to the survey also listed working weekends and long holidays as indicators of the pleasures of the workplace. Only 13% were paid for the extra hours worked while 14% put in more than 12 hours' work on an average day. </p> <p>\"For the past two years, this workforce utopia has held the attention of everyone from Wall Street to Main Street,\" writes Maryann Jones Thompson in the Industry Standard's introduction to the survey. </p> <p>\"But it wasn't all about money. It was fun. What other job could a college graduate walk into at 10am wearing shorts and sandals?

Given that around a third of the workforce is under 30 and often without family responsibilities, it is clear that for many new graduates - 88% of the workforce went to college - there is only one job in town. </p> <p>Despite the recent influx of techno-migrants from India and other Asian countries, the industry remains predominantly white (83%) and around two-thirds male.

Around 15% are offered free massages. Not that the jolly extras are to everyone's liking, with some complaining that the \"non-stop party atmosphere\" was almost as tyrannical as the old economy's tie-wearing deference. </p> <p>In 1986, in his prophetic verse novel about Silicon Valley, The Golden Gate, writer Vikram Seth recounted how \"...Silicon Valley / Lures to ambition's ulcer alley / Young graduates with siren screams / Of power and wealth beyond their dreams\".

  "Two French journalists abducted by Muslim separatists in the Philippines used the confusion created by a military attack on the guerrillas to escape, they said yesterday. <p>Basking in the partial success of his military operation, the Philippine president, Joseph Estrada, said the assault on the Abu Sayyaf rebels on the southern island of Jolo would continue until the remaining 17 hostages held by separatists were free, despite reports of widespread civilian casualties. </p> <p>Television journalists Jean-Jacques Le Garrec, 46, and Roland Madura, 49, who were picked up by an army patrol after their escape and whisked to safety in Manila, said a group of Filipino evangelist hostages were in good health. But they knew nothing about the remaining captives, thought to comprise three Malaysians, one American and one other Filipino. </p> <p>\"For the last four days, we've been very afraid because of the operations in the field,\" Mr Madura said. \"It seems their [rebels'] safety and our own safety was very weak.\" </p> <p>Speaking at a press conference with Mr Estrada and the Philippine army chief of staff, General Angelo Reyes, the Frenchmen said the chance to escape arose on Tuesday night because the rebels were unable to keep a close guard on their prisoners during the nightly moves made necessary by the military pressure. </p> <p>\"We took the opportunity of last night's move when we left at seven[pm] from the place we were,\" Mr Le Garrec said. \"And when we got [to] a road, we took the opportunity of the deep darkness to escape.\" </p> <p>He said the rebels tended to panic when crossing roads. \"Everybody was afraid because getting across the road, we could be seen by the military control,\" Mr Le Garrec said. \"In that big mess, we took the opportunity of jumping on the side. We hid for some minutes and then we ran on the road.\" </p> <p>With no idea of where they were on the island, the two men hid in the jungle until it started raining at about 4am yesterday. \"The noise of the rain gave us the opportunity of moving ourselves without being heard,\" Mr Le Garrec said. \"We walked until day time, having the feeling that we were going towards [the town of] Jolo and expecting to meet the checkpoint.\" </p> <p>They were, in fact, walking away from the town but eventually came across a military patrol. The soldiers took them to Jolo and then flew them out to the regional centre Zamboanga and on to Manila. </p> <p>Mr Le Garrec said the rebels had taken such a liking to the two journalists that he began to fear they would not let them go. </p> <p>\"We were afraid that in the end they would keep us out of affection,\" Mr Le Garrec told his employer, France-2 television, by telephone. </p> <p>He said the rebels sought them out after they withdrew to a corner of the camp. </p> <p>\"They got bored very soon and came to see us, saying 'No, no, come back with us, we want to chat, we are bored when you are not with us',\" Mr Le Garrec said. </p> <p>He said the rebels helped them cook and gave them rice. In return the journalists gave them cigarettes and goodies from the parcels that reached them from France. </p> <p>\"We had established a perfectly trusting relationship and they could not in any way imagine that we would play such a trick on them,\" he said. </p> <p>He later said that he and Mr Madura would have been freed on Saturday if the military had not launched the assault. He said as far as he knew no rebel was hit, although many civilians were. </p> <p>The French president, Jacques Chirac, who had been highly critical of the military operation, welcomed their escape with \"joy and relief\". </p> <p>Mr Estrada said no effort would be spared to free the other hostages and end the crisis that began on April 23 when the Abu Sayyaf kidnapped 21 people from a Malaysian diving resort. </p> <p>All but one Filipino of the original captives were freed after millions of dollars were paid in ransoms. The evangelists were captured when they paid the Abu Sayyaf to be allowed to enter their jungle lair to pray for the hostages. The two men free yesterday were seized on July 9 when they went into the rebels' camp to interview the hostages. </p> <p>Mr Estrada ordered the military strike when the Abu Sayyaf, running out of foreign prisoners, seized three Malaysians from another resort island last week. </p> <p>Jolo residents who fled to Zamboanga yesterday described how they had been caught up in the fighting.

  "<p>There are two ways into Apocalypse, the much-discussed new exhibition at the Royal Academy. You can either walk in, or you can crawl. Norman Rosenthal, co-curator of this exhibition with Max Wigram, invited me to take the latter route. Concertinaed through a grubby, cramped little hatch on my hands and knees, I found myself in a narrow, dank, rubbish-strewn and dimly lit maze. Unsure which way to go, ducking and bungling my way through, I turned and turned again, following what little light there was. Poking my head into a cement-lined cell, I found myself reflected between greasy mirrors, a head in a grim void. Moving on, crab-wise, I finally wormed my way out. </p> <p>This is not so much a habitation or an art installation as a model of an artist's mind, his ever inward-digging bolt hole. Gregor Schneider's Cellar (1985-99) is a version of the house where he lives in Germany, a house he has altered and goes on altering all the time, constructing within it hidden rooms, false windows, spaces within spaces. It is a series of illusions and traps, a sinister lair. How the artist lives, one can only imagine with reluctance and trepidation. There is apparently a room in Schneider's house whose sound-proofed door can be opened neither from within nor from without, should it slam behind you. </p> <p>There is a way out here, a stumble into the larger space of the darkened gallery that contains Schneider's structure. Did the air-kiss-and-tell socialites at Monday's exclusive Prada party at the Royal Academy snag their rags on the rough concrete, rip their tights and spoil their creases on the dirty floor of Schneider's contribution to the show? Heavens, I do hope so. Did the conversation pall in the room where the Holocaust happens, the table-top world that Jake and Dinos Chapman have spent two years making, corpse by corpse, violation by violation? I have no doubt. Nor that the cognoscenti parked their expensive behinds on the polished wooden slatted seats of Darren Almond's shiny glass-and-aluminium bus shelters, which are eventually to be installed in Auschwitz. Almond's work is expressive because of its normality, its hygiene, its cleanliness, its sense of forgetting. </p> <p>Mike Kelley's installation, on the other hand, is a false memory, a reconstruction of the photo of a play in a high-school yearbook. The original photograph is scary in itself, and Kelley has upped the ante, producing a perfect simulacrum of the set - a dingy room containing a rumpled bed, a stupid sculpture on a plinth, an oven with an open door. He has also produced a play, shown on video, whose two participants, closely modelled on the original photo, act out a dark and funny two-hander. Like Endgame, or Steptoe and Son, or Joseph Losey's 1963 film The Servant, the play acts out two lives trapped in the room. It deserves several viewings. It is mannered, twisted, obscene and hilarious. Suicide, Sylvia Plath, ass-fondling, power games and art are its subjects, all done in an early-sitcom style. </p> <p>Like Jeff Koons's work, and like Richard Prince's paintings with stupid old jokes stencilled on them, Kelley's installation digs into the familiar world of the American banal. Whether Kelley wants to be heir to Edward Albee or David Mamet is another matter. Bleak as hell, made bleaker yet by its hilarity and ponderous cliches, Kelley's work has a lightness that most of the rest of the show tries for but can't quite manage. </p> <p>In Chris Cunningham's new video installation Flex, life and death and sex are given a booming Aphex Twin soundtrack. Bodies are beautiful, against interstellar smoky blackness. It is terribly compelling and exciting, but where does it leave us? Looking at a woman with her mouth mashed in and red with blood from a man's punch. His foreskin peeled back in close-up, prelude to an atavistic fuck. It is as though Cunningham was trying to live up to the show's full title, Apocalypse: Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art. </p> <p>Looking at Wolfgang Tillmans's photo of a rose, a rose bleeding red into its white background, I cannot but find it, in the context of Apocalypse, sick, like Blake's rose, like a bloom of blood on a sheet, the tell-tale fleck in the sputum. Tillmans's virulent towering cloudscapes, updating John Martin's eschato- logical 18th-century paintings, are born of aeroplane-window views, stains in the developing tank. In the age of Aids (from which Tillmans's lover died) maybe his work is about grabbing beauty where you can, holding on to moments, seeing beauty or the poignant in the simplest things. The tenderness of his images shines through. </p> <p>As does the malaise in Luc Tuymans's paintings. The reddish-green light, the shapelessness of his rendering of pillows, the bare bulbs dangling in Lamproom, the banality of his image of a folkloric festival, are all some way repulsive. His painting of a cloth embroidered with stilted leaves and flowers, tobacco-stained yellow and hopeless (they have, like Lady Bertram's needlepoint in Mansfield Park, little wit and no beauty) points to the same thing: a sort of disgustedness. They deal, in a certain way, with corruption, in which the bourgeois taste for painting is implicated. There is a deceptive relationship between the image and the manner of its articulation, the work's actual subject and its motif. </p> <p>Maurizio Cattelan's joke sculpture of the Pope, a life-size and realistic sculpture of the pontiff floored by a meteor that appears to have crashed through the glass roof of the gallery, may be found offensive. This act of Cattelan - not God, nor an indifferent universe - is no more troubling, nor funnier, than many of the cartoons one finds in newspapers in Catholic countries. Impeccably staged, it presents a very old kind of apocalyptic vision - of horsemen and fires in the sky, heavenly portents and divine retribution - that we might have thought had disappeared. Yet only this week a Liberal Democrat was promoting a Star Wars offensive against falling rocks and cosmic debris. Plus \u00e7a change - Cattelan's work is a see-once-then-forget-it gag. That so much effort has gone into it renders it monumentally absurd. </p> <p>Tim Noble and Sue Webster's spotlit pile of rubbish bags and detritus casts a shadow image of the artists on the wall - as a prelapsarian couple on a country hillside. Like Mike Leigh's Nuts in May, or Beckett's ever more hopeless peregrinations through bogs and corncrake-inhabited fields, this tableau associates the bucolic with the road to heaven or hell. A road, in this case, paved not with good intentions, but with pure crap. And what are the couple thinking, up there on the hill? I imagine their heads filled with air, or with the endlessly spinning images in Angus Fairhurst's hand-drawn film animation, with its mesmerising cycle of proliferating forms, which wheel, wiggle, multiply and mutate. The forms become overlaid as they turn, ending up with a rotating circle of jumbled black scribble. Being mesmerised can be trance-like and transcendental, which I guess has a kind of beauty in it. Or it can be distressingly repetitive, like an inner voice saying the same thing again and again till you'd chop your own head off to make it stop. Or the whole experience can be merely irritating, and watching Fairhurst becomes a scopophilic version of picking at a scab. His work makes you want to run amok through the galleries, beating other visitors about the head with your Acoustiguide. Time for my medication. </p> <p>The works that - I can only guess - are intended to show a modern idea of beauty are at best horribly pretty. I was too tall to crouch in a praying position in Mariko Mori's high-tech, translucent pagoda, and had to sit with my knees somewhere up about my ears as though I were straining on a potty. Before me, on a curved, womb-like screen, water rose and fell, rain twinkled, jewelly little shapes flickered and swam. This 3-D multimedia experience (you'll have to queue, probably for hours) is all the more tiresome and pathetic for the effort that has gone into it. It bought out the inner child in me, the one that wants to smash things up. </p> <p>Ditto Jeff Koons's paintings of kiddy toys in their world of popcorn, plastic smiles and gaily coloured balloons. This is a heaven made of Mylar. It is impossible to know whether Koons is celebrating childhood's world of grimacing, wide-eyed plastic, or if he is telling us something about the horror of our formative, Toys R Us years. </p> <p> His room comes directly after Hell, the Chapmans' concentration camp diorama, in which mutants run the camp, and the Nazis are the victims. One traces a thread between Koons's infantilism (which makes us realise that children don't inherently like this stuff, but have it imposed on them by adults) and the pre- adolescent grisliness and black humour of the Chapmans' evil world. Hell is a grotesque spectacle of the unconscionable. So too, we must remind ourselves, is Schindler's List. Spielberg's attempt to be sensitive was as meaningless as the Chapmans' impulse to horrify and entertain, which at least has the merit of honesty about our voyeuristic urges. Dealing with the Holocaust as imagery for art, the movies, or literature is inevitably difficult. Hell is saved - if salvation has any meaning here - by the gags, the ludicrousness of it, the impossibility of treating its subject fully and truthfully, without becoming mawkish, mendacious or prurient. The Chapmans' answer is to go too far, which is perhaps not even far enough. </p> <p>In his 1967 book on the apocalypse, The Sense of an Ending, Frank Kermode observed that it is only the outward signs of apocalypse that have changed with the centuries, and that its threat has always been felt to be imminent. \"It is commonplace to talk about our historical situation as uniquely terrible,\" he wrote, \"but can it really be so? Many of [our predecessors] felt as we do. If the evidence looks good to us, so it did to them. Perhaps if we have a terrible privilege, it is merely that we are alive and are going to die, all at once or one at a time.\" This is either itself a common-place, or it is profound. It only matters if this knowledge helps us live more fully. If this show is anything, it is also either banal or profound. Perhaps it is both, but not always in the way it was intended. </p> <p>Apocalypse is at the Royal Academy, London W1 (020-7300 8000), from Saturday to December 15.</p>",
  "Police in India were bracing themselves last night for an explosion of gangland violence after Bombay's leading mafia don survived an audacious assassination attempt during a roof-terrace party in Thailand. <p>Chhota Rajan was relaxing at the gathering in Bangkok when six men wearing suits burst in and sprayed the terrace with bullets. Rajan was hit in the arm and the stomach, but appeared to have survived by jumping off the roof of the bungalow and hobbling away with an injured leg. </p> <p>His right-hand man, Rohit d'Souza, died in the hail of gunfire. D'Souza's wife, Sikandi, and their two-year-old daughter were critically injured. Police later recovered pistols and 48 spent bullets. </p> <p>Responsibility for the assassination attempt has been pinned on Chhota Shakeel, a rival Bombay mafia don based in Dubai. The two men - once allies, now bitter enemies - have been trying to kill each other since 1993 when they fell out. </p> <p>Thai police said they had arrested four suspects in connection with the shooting, three Pakistanis and a Thai national. The suspects apparently told police they had been sent from India as part of a 10-strong gang hired to kill Rajan. </p> <p>According to Indian police sources, the gangsters were recruited by Shakeel in Bombay last month before being whisked to Bangkok via Nepal and Pakistan. </p> <p>The plan to kill Rajan was hatched in Karachi, Pakistan's conspiratorial port city, with the arms used in last Friday's hit smuggled to Thailand by boat. Pakistani intelligence agents may also have been involved, the sources added. </p> <p>Rajan's whereabouts was unclear last night , but the most authoritative report suggested that he was being treated in a Bangkok hospital under the false name of Vijay Daman. </p> <p>Earlier rumours suggested that he had chartered a plane and fled back to his base in Malaysia, from where he masterminds his vast criminal empire. Questions were also being asked as to why Rajan's six normally reliable and heavily armed bodyguards appeared to have let him down. </p> <p>Detectives said privately that, after two years of relative underworld calm, they now expected a wave of tit-for-tat killings as the rival Rajan and Shakeel gangs wrestled for control of Bombay's lucrative drug running and extortion rackets. With Rajan recovering from his wounds, the balance of power has tipped decisively in Shakeel's favour, they added. </p> <p>\"We are still working on various leads,\" Bombay's joint commissioner of crime, D Sivanandan, said. \"We are on top of the situation and will keep a tight grip on underworld activity.\" </p> <p>Shakeel's boss, Dawood Ibrahim, almost undoubtedly sanctioned the attempted killing. It was Ibrahim, resident in Dubai since 1984 and India's most infamous don, who gave Rajan his first break by recruiting him as a contract murderer. Seven years ago, however, following anti-Muslim riots, Ibrahim orchestrated a series of bomb blasts against the Hindu community in Bombay by way of revenge. </p> <p>Rajan, a Hindu, walked out of the gang and a plot to have him drowned failed. Since then the feud has prompted at least 200 killings. But until the Bangkok shootout none of its leading protagonists had been hurt. </p> <p>A school dropout who began his criminal career selling black market cinema tickets, Rajan, 41, now heads an empire with a monthly turnover estimated at \u00a3150m. </p> <p>As well as drug running, he is also involved in the shady world of Bollywood film financing, and extorting protection money, or hafta, from local businessmen. He is named in at least 17 murder cases.</p>",

  "A bitter row has broken out among senior German politicians over two victims of neo-Nazi violence who were ordered out of the country after their ordeals. <p>One has already left. The other is awaiting deportation. In both cases, the results of the attacks are said to have been used by regional officials in eastern Germany as grounds for getting rid of them.</p> <p>Their cases have been taken up by the speaker of the federal parliament, Wolfgang Thierse, who has claimed they demonstrate covert official backing for the far right.</p> <p>One of the foreigners, an Egyptian, Salah el-Nemr, owned a pizzeria in the town of Elsterwerda, 100 miles south-east of Berlin. After it was burned down by skinheads in October 1998, he was told he had lost his right to stay in Germany because his resident's permit was dependent on his having a viable business.</p> <p>Mr el-Nemr, who lived in Germany for 10 years, left the country voluntarily to avoid getting a deportation stamp in his passport that would have prevented him from returning as a visitor. He told a correspondent for the newspaper Berliner Zeitung in Cairo that he hoped to be allowed back in to marry his German fiancee.</p> <p>An Algerian asylum seeker, who has so far been identified only as Khaleb B, lost his right to stay on the grounds that he was no longer mentally fit to manage his life by himself.</p> <p>However, he and his lawyer maintain that this is because of the trauma he underwent in February 1999 when he watched as a friend was lynched in the streets of Guben near the Polish border.</p> <p>He is currently awaiting deportation. The trial of his friend's alleged killers began last week.</p> <p>The political row has erupted against a background of mounting alarm in the federal government over the prevalence of far right and xenophobic sentiment in the formerly communist east. The Brandenburg region around Berlin where both men lived has become notorious for race hate attacks.</p> <p>On July 28, Mr Thierse wrote to the interior minister in the Brandenburg regional government, describing the treatment of the two men as \"devastating\".</p> <p>The speaker, a member of the governing Social Democratic party (SDP), said that decisions taken by the regional administration's aliens department \"give the impression that German government agencies not only accept the consequences of rightwing and racist activity, but even use them as an official pretext\".</p> <p>His accusation brought a heated reaction from the authorities in Brandenburg. Earlier this month, the regional interior minister, J\u00f6rg Sch\u00f6nbohm, a Christian Democrat, replied to Mr Thierse demanding an apology. The head of the Christian Democrat group in the Brandenburg regional assembly accused the speaker of \"abusing his position\".</p> <p>Mr Thierse has taken a keen interest in the issue of neo-Nazi violence and its social underpinnings. He is a frequent visitor to schools in the east.</p> <p>The Brandenburg authorities have claimed that Mr el-Nemr's engagement is a ploy aimed at securing his return. However, when Berliner Zeitung's correspondent traced him in Cairo, he produced an intimate love letter from his fiancee. He was also carrying photographs of the dog and flat he left behind and of his fiancee before and after their separation.</p> <p>One of his friends was quoted as saying: \"Salah changed in Germany. He is serious about his work and always punctual. But what use are these German values if these people are capable of destroying the life of a peaceable, hard-working man from one moment to the next?\"1818 </p>",
  "<p>When Lord Melchett, former Labour minister, working farmer and head of Greenpeace UK, arrived at remote Walnut Tree farm, near Lyng, Norfolk, with 27 others just before dawn on July 26 last year, he knew the environmental group had just a few minutes to destroy the six acre GM maize crop being grown by the three Brigham brothers for seed company Agrevo. </p> <p>With luck, the farm machinery they had brought would work faultlessly, the police would be alerted too late and the \"polluting\" maize would be bagged up and on its way back to the company's head office in King's Lynn before anyone could stop them. </p> <p>The first half of the operation went to plan. Lord Melchett had set off at night from his family farm, some 30 miles away at Ringstead, Norfolk, with an industrial crop cutter on the back of a wagon. Most of the other Greenpeace members had travelled there from London in two minibuses. </p> <p>The rendezvous was near the GM field at 5am. By the time Lord Melchett arrived, the 27 volunteers - who included nine Greenpeace staff and supporters from all over Britain including a Baptist minister - were waiting behind a hedge. </p> <p><strong> Decontamination suits</strong><br> </p> <p> Within seconds, the padlock on the gate barring the GM trial field had been cut, lorry and cutting machine had gone in, followed by the volunteers all dressed in white \"decontamination\" suits. The gate was immediately re-padlocked and Melchett spent an infuriating few minutes trying to set up the machinery. </p> <p>What Greenpeace had not counted on was the alertness and the anger of the Brigham brothers and their determination to protect their crop. Within seconds of the environment group's cutter speeding through the field like a whirling dervish, the three brothers were heading from the farmhouse towards the field on foot and by tractors. </p> <p>The meeting was short but epic. There were moments of real drama and danger for the volunteers and the clash was described as a confrontation between outsiders and locals, with Greenpeace being alternately hailed by the anti-GM lobby and condemned by government and most of the media. </p> <p>William Brigham tried to physically stop the volunteers who had immediately begun cutting the crop by hand and putting it into bags. Meanwhile, John and Eddie Brigham were turning their tractors into mobile battering rams. </p> <p>The two Greenpeace minibuses were damaged. As one brother on his Massey Ferguson ambushed the Greenpeace cutter on its second revolution round the field, striking it down with one blow of his front end loader, another was slamming a heavy JCB-type shovel on top of the Greenpeace lorry preventing it moving. </p> <p>Within 10 minutes, the Greenpeace action was effectively over, with only the volunteers left cutting by hand. At most, one sixth of the field which was about to flower and pollinate, causing what Lord Melchett said would be \"inevitable pollution\", had been cut down. </p> <p>The brothers had caused an estimated \u00a35,000 of damage to the Greenpeace machinery and Greenpeace had caused about \u00a3650 of damage to the crop. </p> <p>The police arrived at about 5.30am. By this time one of the Brighams was speeding round the field in his tractor in pursuit of anyone in a white suit and the volunteers were hiding or throwing themselves deep into the maize to avoid injury, </p> <p><strong> Ecological arguments</strong><br> </p> <p> As the police moved in to arrest Greenpeace members and lead them to relative safety, the political and ecological arguments started. William Brigham confronted Lord Melchett, accusing him of being a criminal: \"I find it amazing that a man calling himself a democrat and is a former government minister sees fit to take the law into his own hands.\" </p> <p>Lord Melchett said: \"This is decontamination of the countryside. This crop shouldn't be grown. We are doing something that the public wants and is for the benefit of the environment.\" He added that Greenpeace was trying to protect other farmers. </p> <p>William Brigham argued that he, rather than Lord Melchett, was working for the community, and that he and his brothers were acting in an ecologically responsible way. </p> <p>\"I wanted to trial these crops to see if there were any downsides,\" he said. </p> <p>Within hours, the Greenpeace 28 had been driven off and Lord Melchett was preparing to spend two nights in Norwich prison after being refused bail.</p>",
  "<p>Shares in Canary Wharf Group hit a high yesterday as the company which built the monument to Thatcherite corporate excess produced its first ever 12-month profit figures eight years after near bankruptcy. </p> <p>Chief executive George Iacobescu said the full-year, pre-tax profit of \u00a354.1m - compared with a \u00a342.8m loss last time - was helped by rising rental income and the sale of completed properties.</p> <p>He was delighted the company was \"two or three years ahead of the business plan\" it had drawn up when it floated 18 months ago, but there was no dividend for shareholders.</p> <p>Canary Wharf, a development centred around Britain's tallest building, was originally built up by Olympia &amp; York under the control of Paul Reichmann, Canary Wharf's chairman. But the 1987 property crash put the whole scheme into the hands of a group of rescuing banks.</p> <p>The development on the Isle of Dogs in east London has made a comeback and now challenges the City as a key location for finance and business and Canary Wharf announced yestreday that the John Lewis-owned supermarket group Waitrose had signed a lease for an 80,000sq ft store which would open in two years time.</p> <p>Discussions are also going on with US energy group Enron while a host of other top City names such as international law firm Clifford Chance have taken office space.</p> <p>Deutsche Bank has been considering a move down the river which would follow its rivals such as HSBC and Citigroup who have already gone to Docklands.

  "<p>New regulator <strong> Philip Fletcher</strong> has signalled that he favours a substantial restructuring of the industry less than two months after succeeding <strong> Sir Ian Byatt</strong> , the former <strong> Ofwat</strong> chief. Shares in the sector have fallen 50% since their peak two years ago - not least because Sir Ian imposed average price cuts of 12% and hefty capital spending targets to improve the environment in his last review. That settlement prompted arethink. <strong> Kelda</strong> announced plans this year to return <strong> Yorkshire </strong> to its original owners, its customers, and make it a debt-financed mutual. Sir Ian scotched that idea but variants are known to have been considered by <strong> Anglian</strong> and <strong> Pennon</strong> , or <strong> South-west Water</strong> . Mr Fletcher, former receiver for the <strong> Metropolitan Police</strong> and an <strong> environment department</strong> official, has said he favours separating ownership of water and sewage assets from their operation. The idea lay at the heart of the bidding war between <strong> Nomura</strong> and <strong> WPD</strong> for control of multi-utility <strong> Hyder</strong> , won by US-owned WPD last month. WPD plans to retain the assets of Hyder's <strong> Welsh Water </strong> but hand over operations to Warrington-based <strong> United Utilities</strong> . <strong> Severn Trent</strong> has challenged this in the high court, where the case will be heard today. Mr Fletcher has upset the status quo by endorsing such schemes: his remarks have been seen as the catalyst for the announcement from <strong> Thames Water</strong> . But he said yesterday he would like Ofwat to move from being a \"facilitator\" to a \"promoter\". </p>",
  "Ministers may refuse to change some laws which are declared by judges to be incompatible with human rights legislation, the lord chancellor said yesterday. <p>Judges will have the power from October 2, when the Human Rights Act comes into force, to declare statutes incompatible with the European convention on human rights. They will not be able to strike down a statute, but the act sets up a fast track procedure for parliament to amend it. </p> <p>But Lord Irvine said: \"In some cases, government and parliament could take the view that there was some sort of overriding reason not to change the law to make it compatible.\" </p> <p>Lord Irvine was asked at a media briefing on the act what the government would do if judges declared the home secretary's power to determine murderers' release dates incompatible with the convention. He replied: \"Decisions of the higher courts should be respected. Some of those decisions will be controversial. The ultimate authority, however, is parliament.\" </p> <p>He added: \"There would be no obligation on government to bring forward legislation. But I do think in the overwhelming majority of such cases government would want to do so. In such a case the government and parliament would have to decide, not judges.\" </p> <p>If the government refused to introduce legislation, it would be up to the aggrieved individual to take the case on to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. </p> <p>Lord Irvine predicted that declarations of incompatibility would be rare. In \"99.9% of cases\", judges would use their power to interpret a statute in such a way as to make it compatible with the convention. </p> <p>Some commentators argue that the act, the biggest change to British law in 300 years, will shift power from parliament to unelected, unaccountable judges. Others predict that the courts will be clogged with lawyers putting forward specious human rights claims. </p> <p>Playing down the likely effects of the act, Lord Irvine said: \"The heavens are not going to fall as a result of the Human Rights Act. I think the prophets of doom will be proved completely false.\" </p> <p>There would be lawyers who argued hopeless points, he said, but judges would resist them. There would be wrong decisions by the lower courts. \"But with every piece of legislation there are teething troubles before it settles down.\"</p>",
  "Two protesters who swam 150 metres in wetsuits to a Trident submarine and smashed testing equipment with a lump hammer could face a retrial for criminal damage, after a jury at Manchester crown court failed to reach a verdict yesterday and was discharged. <p>Rachel Wenham, 28, from Leeds, and Rosie James, 25, from London, were earlier found not guilty of criminal damage for spray painting slogans on the side of HMS Vengeance when it was berthed at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, in February last year. </p> <p>But after more than six hours of deliberation, the jury said it could not reach a majority verdict on another charge of criminal damage for smashing equipment valued at thousands of pounds. </p> <p>During the trial, the women, from the nuclear disarmament group Trident Ploughshares, admitted attacking the submarine. But they pleaded not guilty, arguing that they were acting to prevent a crime because Britain's Trident fleet posed a threat to residents of Barrow-in-Furness and the surrounding area. They claimed their actions were justified under international law. </p> <p>Under cover of darkness, the women swam through Barrow dock and spray-painted the words \"Death Machine\" and \"Illegal\" on the side of the submarine, which was designed to carry a quarter of Britain's nuclear arsenal. They hung a banner saying \"women want peace\" from the conning tower and smashed testing equipment with a lump hammer they had dragged with them. </p> <p>The crown prosecution service is expected to reach a decision on a retrial by the end of the week, but the prosecuting counsel, Dennis Watson, told judge Gerard Humphries that it was likely one would be sought. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Trident Ploughshares Aldermaston women's affinity group said: \"Our case clearly caused a serious dilemma for the jury and it shows that instinctive morality is alive and well. </p> <p>\"If there is a retrial we believe it will be a complete waste of public money to add to the \u00a31.5bn already being spent this year on the Trident system.\"</p>",
  "\u0095 Robert Hughes's snarling tone of pommie-bashing illustrates too well the reason for being uncomfortable about Australian republicanism (Another country, September 18). He speaks bitterly of the \"colonial control\" by Britain and \"cannon fodder\" for wars. The implication is that these things were forced upon Australia by its oppressive colonial master, Britain. In fact the Australian states had representative assemblies almost from the start, and all the things Mr Hughes complains about were the Australians' own decisions. <p>According to Mr Hughes the Australian constitution was written for them by Britain and the British monarch forced on them, with an unelected governor general. In fact it was written by the Australians after lengthy negotiations about federation between the hitherto independent Australian states, and passed into law by the British parliament at their agreed request. </p> <p>I am not suggesting that nothing can be criticised in the history of how Australia evolved from part of the British empire into an independent country. The most obvious thing Britain did wrong, in all the dominions, was that it was far too keen to hand over power to settler assemblies, without insisting on safeguards for the native population.

  "<p>No self-respecting consumer electronics exhibition is complete without a home of the future. A place where \"resting actors\" touting all manner of hi-tech devices explain how, in a few years time, we will be able to use mobile phones to program the temperature of our bath water. </p> <p>It is all tremendous fun and sure to fire the imagination of those who see it. But is this really what awaits the nation's semis? The organisers of Live 2000, opening at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London today, certainly believe so. They have developed a Smart Home to show how products can talk to each other intelligently and be programmed via the internet or by a mobile phone. </p> <p>Live's visitors can explore four rooms bristling with screens, keypads and gadgets. And, as all the electrical devices are linked, users can control them via a keypad, or remotely using a mobile phone. Among the hi-tech conjuring tricks the system will perform is the ability to operate curtains, blinds and lighting. There is also the option of switching the oven on remotely, or the chance for family members to play PC games against each other while in different rooms. </p> <p>But while tomorrow's smart homes will control everything from your PC to your toaster via an advanced \"webpad\" remote control (or, eventually, a third generation mobile phone), today things are rather different. </p> <p>Most of the devices in your home can't even talk to each other yet, let alone respond to the instructions of our keypad toting cyber-dad. </p> <p>So for the concept of the smart home to develop, household items must first learn to talk to each other and operate together, preferably using IP (internet protocol). </p> <p>Until a few years ago all that household electrical items had in common was a mains plug. More recently both consumer electronics and PC manufacturers have woken up to the fact that communication between household devices would simplify consumers' lives. </p> <p>The first inter-device communication standards have begun to appear. Until now they have nearly always been \"wired\" and usually limited to other products of a similar type. For example, printers, digital cameras and computers typically communicate via USB (universal serial bus) cables, while audio visual equipment relies increasingly on the latest IEEE1394 technology, which Sony and its licencees call iLink and Apple, the original developer, calls FireWire. </p> <p>In some quarters, iLink has been touted as the key to home automation. In some ways it has been extremely successful having been incorporated into 50 million VCRs, camcorders, audio systems and even PCs to enable high-speed operations between various devices. </p> <p>Among its champions is Eddie Odjik, Philips' consumer electronics vice president of system architectures. He says: \"iLink is the only technology around today that allows jitterless video connectivity between devices. It already offers 100Mbps data transfer, fast enough for around 20 MPEG2 digital video streams.\" </p> <p>The format's one weakness is that it doesn't yet support multi-room operation. The current iLink standard works only over distances up to 4.5m (14.6ft) - which is nowhere near enough if, for example, you want to run a lead between the lounge and the bedroom. </p> <p>An enhanced iLink specification, capable of operating over distances of up to 100m, will be available, but possibly not until 2002. By then it may have been overtaken, certainly in the home automation field, by wireless technologies. </p> <p>In fact, most industry commentators seem to agree that wireless connection is the way forward (who wants to spend hours installing wires around the home?). But which system? Several formats are battling it out for a slice of what is becoming an increasingly lucrative market. </p> <p>Emerging as front runners are two wireless RF (radio frequency) standards, Wireless LAN - versions of the high-speed Ethernet local area network, also known as IEEE802.11) -and the slower, more imaginatively named Bluetooth technology. </p> <p>In the US, many Apple iMacs and PCs are now shipped with wireless LAN technology for connecting them together and to broadband internet services. </p> <p>Visitors to Live will see a prototype version of Sony's Bluetooth VAIO computer and a Bluetooth mobile phone and headset from Ericsson, both scheduled for release in 2001. From this month, Toshiba in the US will also start selling a Bluetooth card for its notebook PCs capable of communicating with Bluetooth devices once they are launched in 2001. </p> <p>Initially, both wireless formats will be targeted at computer users seeking a more robust alternative to infrared connection for transferring data to and from their notebook computers/PDAs and desktop PCs. </p> <p>For example, a person working on a laptop in the living room could print out a document on a printer in the upstairs study. </p> <p>However, this represents only a small part of what wireless will be able to offer. Boasting a range of 10m, which can be extended to 100m, Bluetooth is expected to herald the home network revolution in the UK, enabling the connection any IP-enabled device - whether a fridge or a VCR - to a central PC or home server. Combine this with a Wap or third generation UMTS (universal mobile telephone system) mobile phone and it will even be possible to control Bluetooth-enabled devices from outside the home. </p> <p>Using an internet compatible mobile phone, for example, you will one day be able to program the VCR remotely. You could even develop a series of macros to announce your arrival home. So with one flick of a switch the house lights and heating will be turned on, the kettle set to boil, your robot dog will hit over-excitement mode, and the hi-fi system will launch into a suitably regal fanfare. </p> <p>Earlier this year, Nokia predicted that future generations of its multimedia terminal set-top boxes (the industry jargon for the latest digital TV decoders) would feature a mobile phone -interface, even allowing the possibility of a Wap-controlled sauna. Andy Baker, the chairman of home automation trade organisation Cedia (Custom Electronic Design and Installation Association), says: \"Today we can automate just about any process, money permitting. But with the arrival of the internet-based solutions, home automation will become much more affordable and common place.\" </p> <p>While the idea of a remote-controlled sauna, let alone a fully automated home, may seem a little way off, a new breed of intelligent \"home server\" - blending the traditional PC with audio visual functionality in one box - is slowly beginning to emerge. </p> <p>Last month, Imerge of Cambridge launched a home audio server that can stream up to 16 different audio tracks to different rooms in the home from a built-in hard drive. </p> <p>Next month also sees the arrival of the first intelligent home video server from Sky/TiVo. And although the first generation set-top box will not offer wireless multi-room facilities, it will feature a 30 gigabyte hard disk drive for capturing programmes according to the user's chosen preferences and viewing patterns, as well as making it possible to pause and rewind live programmes. </p> <p>Next year, the Sky proposition will be enhanced when Pace, a British company, produces its first personal television recorder in conjunction with the satellite broadcaster. Not only will this feature two integrated digital satellite tuners (so that viewers can, for the first time, watch one Sky digital channel while recording another), it will also incorporate a 40GB hard disk recording system. </p> <p>Sky's arch-rival ONdigital has begun to offer full internet access via its decoder. Although the digital terrestrial broadcaster insists it has no plans to launch a personal video recorder, the inclusion of a hard disk drive in its next generation of decoders is considered by many to be a must. </p> <p>With the gradual emergence of broadband ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) internet connections and digital fibre optic cable systems, many of the smart home concepts will become a reality. </p> <p>Kingston Interactive Television in Hull and Home Choice in London already use ADSL for video on demand (VOD) and high speed internet access, and last month, BT launched its Openworld high speed internet service in some parts of the UK. </p> <p>But these services represent just a tiny part of what the broadband home can offer. Set-top box manufacturers such as Philips, Pace, Nokia and Pioneer are now working on \"home gateway\" devices that could soon form the hub of a home networking system. </p> <p>Today, it is usually just the PC that is connected to the telephone line. In the broadband home, all IP-compatible products, from the toaster to the fridge, will use RF wireless technologies such as Bluetooth for hooking up to the home gateway server. </p> <p>In France, Pioneer is working with Canal Plus, a European broadcaster, to develop an MP3-based audio on demand service where tracks can be distributed from the home gateway to portable audio devices around the home. </p> <p>In the UK, Pace is working on a product called the Shopping Mate. This will let users scan the groceries they need into a handheld device, and transfer the information to the supermarket via their home gateway set-top box. </p> <p>Two years ago, Nokia unveiled a prototype of its Mediascreen, a handheld device that can be carried around the house so that users can watch digital TV, or surf the net, wherever they are in the home. </p> <p>All three products are expected to go on sale within the next two years. So while it is not worth putting your order in for one of Live's Smart Homes just yet, you probably haven't got too many years to wait. </p> <p>One question remains: Do we really need all this interconnectivity? </p> <p>Earlier this year, LG paraded its first internet fridge. The cool-box was stacked with intelligent features. It not only enabled users to log what foods were in the fridge, but also made suggestions as to what kind of dish they could rustle up using them. You could also use the fridge to surf the net, play MP3s and email digital camera images. </p> <p> There's no denying that technologically the fridge is very impressive. But back in the real world, is anyone really going to want to check out the latest financial news via their cool-box? </p> <p>The last couple of decades have been littered with technologically impressive ideas that failed because they sported just a few too many buttons. Perhaps the Smart Home may prove to be a little too intelligent to really transform our lives. </p> <p><strong>How does Bluetooth work?</strong></p> <p>Imagine being able to send music files to your MP3 player, then playing them on your headphones, without any wires connecting the three devices. With Bluetooth, that's exactly what you could be doing in about a year's time. Named after 10th century ruler King Harald II of Denmark, who apparently had a bad tooth, Bluetooth uses the 2.4GHz frequency band to connect various digital devices wirelessly. </p> <p>Digital cameras, printers, PCs, personal organisers and mobile phones are just some of the peripherals that could easily be linked together. It may even be possible to use a Bluetooth-enabled credit card device to pay for products in shops without even going to a cash desk. Backed by several leading companies, including IBM, Intel, Ericsson, Toshiba and Nokia, Bluetooth allows wireless data transfer between various products at speeds of up to 1Mbps. That is considerably faster than today's 56kbps dial-up modems, though still not fast enough for full-screen MPEG2 digital video. Another drawback is that range is currently limited to around 10m making the technology only suitable for connecting up products in the same building.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Nice try, but it's the wrong sort of tackle <br> Rugby 2001</strong> Windows 95/98 \u00a334.99 The Creative Assembly/EA<br> Rugby games are rare, and this is the best since Codemasters published Rage's Jonah Lomu Rugby for Sony's PlayStation in April 1997. </p> <p>Unfortunately, it isn't quite as much fun, partly because a PC keyboard is less suitable for this type of game than a console gamepad. </p> <p>EA's Rugby 2001 scores in sound and graphics. At high resolutions, the PC graphics are very good, though the players are not particularly recognisable and the crowd has not been given much attention. The worst thing is the camera movement: the viewpoint swings around following the play in a way that almost makes you seasick. Not even changing the default view to sideline cam or isometric cam makes it behave. </p> <p>The sound, however, includes an outstanding commentary from Bill McLaren and former England and New Zealand centre Jamie Salmon. If only soccer commentators were as frank and honest. </p> <p>In most respects, Rugby 2001 is easy to play, and you can score fabulous solo tries, if you can just manage to pick up the ball. But as usual, the ruck and maul aspect of the game is nothing like as well handled as the kicking and passing. The Creative Assembly, based in Sussex, did the PC version of EA's Rugby World Cup 1995 then developed Australian Rugby League (ARL96), Australian Rules Football (AFL 98 and 99), and EA Sports' Cricket World Cup 99, before branch ing out with Shogun:Total War. </p> <p>The market for minority sports sims is not very competitive, so Rugby 2001 should satisfy the fans. </p> <p>However, it does not have the playability to satisfy a less committed audience.

Rather than release a simple cash-in (like the Yellow Game Boy version), Nintendo has gone for a unique gaming experience. </p> <p>The aim is simple: explore Pok\u00e9mon Island and take photographs of all the inhabitants. Then, back in the lab, the photos are marked for pose and size, with rewards including new courses and goodies. Your vehicle is set on rails with no control over direction, but there is plenty to be getting on with. </p> <p>Throw food to get that perfect \"Pok\u00e9mon at lunch\" pose? Lob a pester ball and snuff out that hidden Bulbusaur? Or play the flute and take a high-scoring dancing picture? Strategy takes over surprisingly quickly and you'll need to use combinations of food, music and annoyance to get a successful album. </p> <p>You can save your best snaps for posterity, but with only six courses and (criminally) only 63 out of 151 Pok\u00e9mon involved, there are genuine longevity issues. While there is a real incentive to \"snap 'em all\", it is likely that the Game Boy will be bought out sooner than many parents would have hoped. </p> <p>Still, while it lasts, Pok\u00e9mon Snap is absorbing fun and it's a shame that it will be ignored by anyone aged over 10. Although it's too cutesy, the actual premise of the game is highly original and worthy of a wider audience. (GH)</p> <p> <strong> Fun for those foul-mouthed gun fanatics<br> Team Buddies</strong> Sony PlayStation \u00a329.99 Studio Camden/Sony <br> Guns are fun. That's the message of this game, in which the tranquil world of the Buddies is plunged into bloody chaos when Baddies introduce them to the joys of high-powered weaponry. </p> <p>The Buddies are basically pills with legs; think the Homepride bloke minus his bowler. They're smiley, they're happy, and they live to dance - that is, until the Baddies begin their evil experiment. </p> <p>But it's not all about running round and shooting things; there's a significant strategic element too. Crates fall from the skies . By carrying these to construction pads and arranging them, the Buddies build up their forces. One crate gets you a bog-standard Uzi, two stacked build a new Buddy, and a stack of eight turns into a tank. </p> <p>The principles are simple. Putting them into practice is a different kettle of fish. Every button on the joypad has at least one use, and the in-game tutorial consists of no nine sections. It takes a while to get the hang of, but the mayhem that ensues is worth it. </p> <p>So who's it aimed at? Not kids, if the Buddies' cheery refrain of \"f***in' 'ell\" is anything to go by. </p> <p>While up to four can join in the mayhem, it needs too much thinking for this to be a mindless post-pub hit. </p> <p>It will be a shame if Team Buddies does fall between demographic stools, because it's frantic, foul-mouthed and funny - if a tad too clever for its own good.

  "<p><strong> Crusoe ahoy</strong><br> Sony could be the first notebook PC supplier to launch a system powered by Transmeta's new Crusoe processor, instead of an Intel or AMD chip. But when Sony showed off a wide range of forthcoming products at its annual European sales conference, held in Venice last week, the PCG-C1VE was overshadowed by other devices. These included the Clie palmtop (What's New, September 7), a new Cybershot digital camera, and the feature-packed J5 mobile phone. </p> <p>The C1VE notebook is small: it has much the same casing as the PCG-1, and the same swivelling Motion Eye camera built in to the lid. And with its 600MHz Crusoe chip, 128 megabytes of memory and 12GB hard drive, the C1VE packs a lot of power into a 1kg package. However, the Crusoe chip's compatibility remains to be proven, and Sony was claiming a only 2.5 hour battery life for its notebook. This is a lot less than the 10-12 hours we expected from the Crusoe's power-saving design. </p> <p>With an estimated price of \u00a31,499 plus VAT when it appears around the end of October, the C1VE may find it hard to win sales. </p> <p>The reverse could well be true with the new PCG-SR11K notebook PC, which is not quite as small but looks more stylish. The SR11K has a 600MHz Intel Pentium III SpeedStep chip instead of the Crusoe, a 10.4in instead of a 9in screen, and Microsoft Windows 2000 instead of Windows Me. It also comes with an external CD-rom drive that costs extra on the C1VE, and while it is a little shorter on memory and hard disk space (64MB, 10GB), it still only weighs 1.36kg. </p> <p>The CMD-J5 mobile phone is like the Z5 launched in June but offers even more features. For example, it lets you record your own ring, so you could use your dog's bark or your better half's titter. It has Tegic's predictive T9 software for fast text entry, and the SMS capability has been extended so you can send images and sounds to other J5 owners, as well as text messages. Like the Z5, the J5 includes Microsoft's Microbrowser, so it can handle HTML as well as Wap pages. </p> <p>Sony had to admit that the J5 could not talk to its Palm-compatible Clie electronic organiser, but said that when the Clie appears in the UK next year, it will. </p> <p>Both new notebook PCs, the Clie, and the J5 phone have slots for Sony Memory Sticks. All four also have Jog Dials, Sony's circular menuing system. </p> <p>The new DSC-P1 camera uses Memory Sticks too, and Sony claims this has helped it make this Cybershot model noticeably small for a 3.34 megapixel camera. The design is unusual because the 3x zoom lens is right at the end of the body, but the whole thing is only 113mm long. The P1 Cybershot can be used to produce images from 640 by 480 pixels (VGA resolution) up to 2,048 by 1,536 pixels, and it can also record short MPEG movies. </p> <p>Sony also showed many other new products: video cameras, a projector, an electronic photo printer, a Digital8 Video Walkman, more notebook PCs and even some desktop PCs. (The desktops are already on sale in the US and Japan, and will eventually reach the UK.) And if the stream of new gadgets grew tiring after a while, we could at least be grateful for the absence of new audio and hi-fi systems, video recorders, TV sets, television set-top boxes and other Sony devices from the Aibo robotic dog to PlayStation 2 games console. </p> <p>At least it makes sense of Sony's design strategy. It has to make all its gizmos as small as possible so that customers still have room to buy more. </p> <p> <strong> Born in the UK</strong> </p> <p> Most British people are not descended from Americans, but no one would know this from the American genealogy software sold in the UK. However, Sierra Home - an American subsidiary of France's Havas Interactive - has finally done something about it. It is releasing its Generations software in two localised editions. Generations Starter Kit 8.0 UK Version provides everything most people need, and comes on 11 CDs. Generations Grande Suite 8.0 UK Version includes a lot more data on 20 CDs. It is the one to get if you really need the Magna Charta Sureties, Griffith's Valuation, and various historical records such as the UK Deeds Index Database, the US Civil War Muster Rolls, and the Titanic passenger list. The Starter version goes on sale tomorrow for Microsoft Windows 95/98. </p> <p><strong> Sounds safe </strong><br> Smart cards would be more secure if they could only be used to the sound of their master's voice. Domain Dynamics, based near Swindon, has now shown that this is possible by developing voice authentication soft ware small enough to fit on to an 8KB smart card. The system uses Domain Dynamics' Tespar (time encoded signal processing and recognition) technology to store a template of the card owner's voice. The user provides a speech sample, which is then processed and checked against the template stored on the card. Ian Taylor, a director of the company, says mobile commerce is an obvious application but can \"foresee a range of applications from access control for confidential data to payments made via TV set-top box or PC\". Domain Dynamics is now looking for companies to license the technology for various devices. See <a href=\"http://www.ddl.ision.co.uk\">www.ddl.ision.co.uk</a> </p>",
  "<p>Winter in the Antarctic , the coldest and windiest place on earth. Millions of kilometres of sea remain frozen all year, but as temperatures plummet, up to 20 million square kilometres of ocean - an area twice the size of the USA - are covered with a white layer of ice. </p> <p>The ice may appear barren, but a closer look reveals a multitude of microbial life. Small as they are, these microbes exert an influence over the whole Southern Ocean, and may control the destiny of penguins and seals thousands of miles away. The loss of their habitat, the ice, through global warming, could have devastating consequences. </p> <p>To understand this story, stop looking at things from a warm-blooded human perspective - we wouldn't last long in that cold - and think small. For the microbes that get trapped in the ice, it's not a bad place to be. </p> <p>Temperatures on the ice surface can reach -30C, but on the underside it is a relatively hospitable -1.8C, free from wind and currents. The microbes of this region can function well at freezing temperatures, often as actively as organisms in far warmer waters. </p> <p>\"Ice algae\" were formally described more than 150 years ago. Any passenger on an ice- breaking ship would notice the brown and green layers on the underside of ice that had broken up.But these organisms were not thought to be an important part of the ecology of Polar seas, and attention focused on the algal blooms in the open ocean. </p> <p>As the sea begins to freeze, algae become attached to the growing ice crystals and get concentrated as the ice forms. The majority of the algae live in channels of brine formed when salt gets squeezed out as the water freezes, giving rise to salt concentrations five times higher than seawater. </p> <p>Only a tiny fraction of the light hitting the surface of the ice reaches the bottom, where the majority of the algae live, so the organisms must be well adapted to high salt concentrations and low light. </p> <p>The ice is home to a diverse and complex ecosystem, composed of more than 200 species of algae, as well as a massive diversity of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and higher organisms such as amphipods and even flatworms. It is a mini-ecosystem in a frozen sponge. </p> <p>Algae are microscopic plants that use the sun's light to harvest carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When spring approaches, the algal population explodes on a diet of sunlight and minerals from the sea. British Antarctic Survey biologist Simon Brockington says: \"Diving in the middle of winter, the new ice is pristine white. Later in the year it can be like looking up at a field of grass.\" </p> <p>The area of the southern sea-ice far exceeds that of the Antarctic continent, covering an area up to two and a half times the size of Australia. That's a very large meadow. </p> <p>As the algae bloom, they suck in millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide which they convert into carbon. This is an important process in the global carbon cycle, and scientists estimate that the ice algae account for 5% of the total amount of carbon trapped through photosynthesis in this region. </p> <p>Algae are the fuel for the entire southern ocean ecosystem because, like grass, they are grazed by bigger creatures. They sustain the most important Antarctic marine food resource, the small shrimplike krill. Krill can graze the underside of the ice at an amazing rate, clearing a 20cm square in five minutes, says Peter Marshall at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar Marine Research. Krill are the main meal for many predators such as penguins, seals and whales. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, prior to comprehensive research into the sea-ice, it was assumed that krill were fed by the summer algal bloom in the open water, then hibernated on the sea floor in winter. However, scuba divers under the winter sea-ice off the Antarctic Peninsula saw krill nibbling the ice-algae which were still present in the ice. </p> <p>Two thousands of miles north east of the Antarctic Peninsula, on the island of South Georgia, British Antarctic Survey scientists were studying creatures at the opposite end of the food chain, penguins and fur seals. Three or four times a decade they observed terrible years for breeding, with few pups or chicks surviving. Feeding studies showed that the lean years for these creatures were also lean years for the krill, with no juvenile krill in the water. Krill are not only important for wildlife, but for commercial fisheries too. So it was vital to find out what was causing these slumps. </p> <p>For answers, scientists looked to the Antarctic Peninsula, a major breeding ground for krill and the possible source of the South Georgia krill. A strong relationship was observed between the extent of sea-ice and the krill numbers. In years when the climate reduced the ice cover near the Antarctic Peninsula, krill production slumped. So the icy pastures of the ice-algae may be having a huge impact on the ecology of the whole Southern Ocean. </p> <p>Biologist Robin Ross of the Marine Science Institute, University of California, thinks that without the winter pasture krill \"wouldn't be able to live through winter\". </p> <p>If normal climatic conditions were having such a profound impact on Southern Ocean ecology through sea-ice formation, what havoc could global warming cause? </p> <p>Warmer temperatures can mean thinner sea-ice, which, says biologist William Ambrose of Bates College USA, \"is likely to promote lux uriant growth of algae\", based on observations from thin sea-ice years in the Arctic. </p> <p>Ironically more algae mean less ice. Being dark, ice-algae absorb heat from the sun more than the ice that surrounds them, speeding up melting and pitting the ice with a honeycomb of large pores. But if atmospheric warming reduces the area of sea-ice, the future could be bleak for penguins, seals and the fishing industry. \"If global warming caused low ice extent for three out of four years\" says Ross, \"there could be a serious problem for krill survival.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Dr Alison George is a microbiologist with the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge .</p>",
  "<p>God's particle discovered, proclaimed some of the wilder media last week: \"Has Cern discovered the Higgs?\" was the more sober headline. And the answer? No one knows. </p> <p>On September 14 the directors of Cern, the nuclear research centre, had to make a judgment worthy of Solomon. If you want to know the answer, jump to the end and do not appeal to hindsight in a couple of years if it turns out that they got it wrong. To decide for yourself: read on. </p> <p>Fifty metres below the fields north-west of Geneva is a tunnel, as long as the Circle Line on the London Underground, which for the past 10 years has been home to the large electron positron collider, LEP. Collisions between electrons and their antimatter counterparts, positrons, reproduce fleetingly conditions unknown since the first split second after the Big Bang. The \"standard model\" of the fundamental particles and the forces that control them, building up bulk matter in the universe, has been defined by the experiments at LEP. </p> <p>At the end of this month LEP will close. presidents, heads of state, nobel laureates and other dignitaries will gather at Cern on October 9 to celebrate LEP's achieve ments and look to the future: the LHC, the large hadron collider. Whereas LEP has used lightweight electrons and positrons, the LHC will swing two counter-rotating beams of protons around the circuit where LEP is currently housed. Protons are some 2,000 times more massive than electrons and will pack a greater punch, probing deeper into the Big Bang than has been possible at LEP, which is being closed to make way for the LHC. </p> <p>The LHC will be the machine that takes us to the start of time, when the masses and identities of the electron and other particles critical to our existence were encoded. The mass of these seeds of all matter has determined the size of atoms, the structures of the universe and enabled the delicate balances in the forces of nature that made possible the emergence of intelligent life. Had they been even slightly different, we would probably not be here. </p> <p>Small wonder then that the more colourful media refer to the prime suspect, the Higgs Boson, as God's Particle. </p> <p>The start date for the LHC is officially July 2005. The schedules are tight and the budgets even tighter. Around the world, teams are building the detectors, magnets and electronics that will eventually form the LHC. There are penalty clauses if certain deadlines are missed. And the first milestone is the closure of LEP on September 2000. </p> <p>Imagine LEP as a searchlight probing into the darkness of our ignorance. During the past year its range has been stretched further than had been thought possible. Then, at the extremes of its range where the beam had faded to little more than a flicker, it glanced upon what appeared to be the shadow of the yeti. Three, maybe four, possible sightings of the phantom in the darkness are all the scientists have seen. </p> <p>In the raw mathematics of probability they are 99% sure that it is the Higgs. This might sound as near to certainty as you can get, but is more like a tossed coin coming up heads six times on a row: keep tossing and you may be surprised how often runs of six, seven or even more come up. In summary: this is on the tantalising borderlines of being nothing at all, or of being like John the Baptist, giving portents for one of the great discoveries in science. </p> <p>If LEP could continue a bit longer, we might be able to decide which it is. But if LEP stops and the chimera really is the Higgs, the glory will probably go to Fermilab in the US which should be able to find it by around 2002. However, if it is no more than a chimera, and the Higgs is lurking even deeper in the darkness, as was thought until recent months, Fermilab may miss out, leaving the LHC as the only place on Earth capable of finding it. </p> <p>So imagine you are director-general. You are paid well to make tough decisions; what do you do? At first sight the answer is obvious: run LEP a little longer. What harm can a few months make? A lot actually. One month you can probably get away with but while the added illumination in that time may be able to show if the shadow was a chimera, it is unlikely to be able to confirm the Higgs if it is really there. Two or three months then? A problem here is that as winter approaches, the cost of electricity rises. </p> <p>The experiments at Cern are concentrated in the cheap meter periods. In practice, November to February are out, and so a \"mere\" three months spills over into spring 2001 and you are in danger of being a year delayed. The LHC is due to start in July 2005. Here too there will be the constraints of winter clo sure and the fear that its start could slip until 2006. Some of the contracts depend rather critically upon those dates. </p> <p>Think of all those penalty clauses and European industry. Think of the significant amounts of money from the Department of Energy in the US, whose own Fermilab laboratory is metaphorically waiting with bated breath as it could have a free run for the Higgs if you miss it now. Think of losing out in the history of science; think of the accountants_ </p> <p>The paradox of science is that if you know the answers in advance you don't need to do the experiment. And when you don't know the answers and the experiments cost a small fortune, let alone the political and psychological pressures from would be Nobel Laureates in the wings, how do you form a judgement on what is the best option? The decision has now been made. It is that experiments will continue at LEP until November 2. </p> <p>This is short enough not to compromise the LHC or the electricity budgets unduly. Whether it will be long enough to know what is hiding in the dark, only time (and possibly Fermilab, or the LHC), will tell.

Domains that are country-specific such as theguardian.com or amazon.fr are registered in their respective countries, and each country maintains the right to create sub-domains of its own national top-level domains (TLDs). </p> <p>I doubt that Britain had to consult the US for permission to create the domains royal.uk or parliament.uk! </p> <p>As for the traditionally \"American\" TLDs such as .com, .org and .net, these are no longer under the sole control of Network Solutions, and you can register a domain under one of these TLDs in a number of countries, including Britain, France and Australia. </p> <p><strong> Dr David Harper</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:adh@sanger.ac.uk\">adh@sanger.ac.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> BT defended</strong><br> Reading in your columns the various moans from disaffected internet users, you would think that British Telecom was guilty of single-handedly holding back hi-tech Britain. This, obviously, is not so. That honour has to be shared, surely, between the dot.com companies with such dubious ideas, a heavy handed government and, most of all, all those here-today-gone-tomorrow internet service providers who promised net users the earth, but delivered nothing. In all this, British Telecom might have acted slowly with things like high speed internet access and a flat rate for internet calls. But at least it has not acted in haste and promised what it could not deliver or, even worse, endangered the telephone system. Who would you rather have running Britain's telephone network: BT or AltaVista?  <strong> Robert Osborne</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:robertosborne51@hotmail.com\">robertosborne51@hotmail.com</a> </p> <p> <strong> Mac problems</strong><br> Online's comment about Mac users having fewer problems may well be true, though I have to say that I've had more problems with my iMac than with earlier models. However, it cannot be said loud enough that the Mac system files are very easy for an amateur to get the hang of, and when there are problems there is an excellent library of advice on the Apple website: <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/support/\">www.apple.com/support</a>.<br> <strong> Philip Bowler</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:pgbowler@emirates.net.ae\">pgbowler@emirates.net.ae</a> </p> <p><strong> CD right </strong><br> George Kitchin (Feedback, September 14) thinks it hardly worth bothering to buy CD-roms any more. </p> <p>The fact that CD-RWs are usable only on the machine that wrote them is a reason to bother, I would have thought, especially, perhaps, if you are using CD-RW for backup. <br> <strong> Conrad Cork</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:conradcork@tadleyewing.co.uk\">conradcork@tadleyewing.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Paid for letter</strong><br> Simon Bisson's article, An easier way to turn clicks so cash, featured details of WorldPay as an example of a provider of online payment solutions. </p> <p>However, Planet Payment outperforms WorldPay in all the areas mentioned in the article. </p> <p>Planet Payment operates in 140 countries; takes a lower handling fee than WorldPay; through partnerships offers e-business solutions in all five continents; is allied with a large, international network of acquiring banks, including NatWest; offers its payment solutions to the mobile internet; and can multi-currency enable any merchant within minutes </p> <p>OK, I'm biased as I represent Planet Payment.

  "What will happen to nine Cubans whose plane crashed into the gulf of Mexico looked likely to emerge as a fresh source of controversy in US-Cuban relations as investigations continued yesterday into what appeared to be an ill-fated bid to fly to Florida. <p>Reports from Cuba suggested that the plane, a small state-owned crop-duster, had been stolen by its pilot, Lenin Iglesias, who picked up nine friends and relatives at an airstrip on the western tip of the island before taking off and heading out over the Florida strait on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>Mr Iglesias told Cuban air-traffic control that the plane had been hijacked \"with children aboard\" - an apparent precaution to avoid being shot down by the Cuban air force. The plane then appears to have veered off course, run out of fuel, and ditched in the sea, 60 miles west of the Cuban coast. An unidentified male passenger died in the crash.</p> <p>One of the survivors, Rodolfo Fuentes, was reported by doctors to be recovering well in a Key West hospital. The other survivors were due to be transferred last night to a US coast guard cutter where they were to be interviewed by FBI and immigration officials.</p> <p>According to a 1996 law, would-be Cuban emigrants who succeed in setting foot on dry land in the US are allowed to stay.</p>"
