  "<p>In the end last night was one of wild celebration in the Toon as goals from two home debutants and a forgotten man beat a stubborn Derby side. Not even the dismissal of Warren Barton for hauling back Deon Burton or Seth Johnson's late second could spoil the party. </p> <p>Summer building work has increased the capacity to more than 52,000 and Tyneside hosted its largest crowd since 1973 with the darling of the Gallowgate that day, Malcolm Macdonald, back to mark the occasion. It was clear they expected Derby, without six regulars, to be torn apart - Rams to the slaughter. </p> <p>The breathtaking start suggested as much. With four minutes gone Kieron Dyer fed Nolberto Solano down the right. The Peruvian tricked his way past Danny Higginbotham and crossed for Carl Cort who, under challenge from Otto Bragstad, headed into the corner of the net. </p> <p>But, while the Newcastle whirlwind continued to rage, it rapidly blew out of control. Burton might have levelled had Nicos Dabizas not intevened and, when United did emerge from midfield with the ball, Solano's pass was just too strong for the on-rushing Dyer. </p> <p>Rhythm was further disrupted by Cort's withdrawal after the half-hour as County's midfield steadily took control. Stefano Eranio teased his way past two players before curling an effort over the bar and Burton should have done better moments later when through on goal. </p> <p>The crowd, starved of their goal feast, vented their frustrations. Their disappointment was complete on the stroke of half-time as Johnson's innocuous ball into the area caught the home defence dithering and Branko Strupar calmly placed an equaliser beyond Shay Given. </p> <p>But parity was retained only for the duration of the interval. A minute after the break Stephen Glass's cross was half-cleared by the beleaguered Bragstad and Cordone nipped in to restore United's lead. </p> <p>This time there would be no revival. Glass, who spent most of last season on the treatment table or the transfer list and was seizing his chance with some glee, saw to that by curling a magnificent left-foot shot into the top corner from 30 yards. </p> <p>Higginbotham's last ditch challenge prevented Alan Shearer adding a fourth but Derby's defence had long since descended into blind panic. Macdonald must have fancied his chances.</p>",

  "<p>Modern English batsmanship, by and large, attracts the sort of notices associated with uncompromising socialists and any movie starring Jean-Claude van Damme. All the more reason, therefore, to have been here yesterday. David Graveney was, although whether what he witnessed provoked delight or dismay is another kettle of cod entirely. </p> <p>On a sluggish pitch whose occasionally subterranean bounce is expected to make batting last a fraught affair, Mike Atherton, John Crawley and Andrew Flintoff put Lancashire in sight of a significant lead in their vividly contrasting ways. Crawley alone turned control into a century but the spectacle was no less hypnotic for that. </p> <p>Obliged, seemingly, to accommodate a spinner at the Oval - how Laker, Lock and Wardle would have reacted to such a state of affairs one shudders to think - the England selectors could always go on form and do the brave thing: drop Atherton. </p> <p>Troubled initially by Jon Dakin's pace, he never got out of second gear yet pushed, steered and nudged his way to 48 in 51 overs before being trapped by Phil DeFreitas's grubber. For England to take on Courtney and Curtly without the master of stubbornness still seems too risky. </p> <p>Outscoring Atherton four-to-one in a 97-run partnership, Crawley all but toyed with Anil Kumble, endorsing the conviction held by some that overlooking his expertise against spin on the subcontinent would be even riskier. </p> <p>His partnership with Flintoff, who biffed 55 off 60 balls, added 89 at nearly seven an over and was akin to being confronted with a set meal offering the best of Thai and British. Where Crawley is all subtle spices and light noodles, Flintoff is strictly meat and potatoes; Kumble undid him, as he always appeared destined to. </p> <p>To see the Indian sans moustache - the result of a vow at Canterbury that resulted in his most productive match of a so-so summer - is shocking enough. Now he has promised, should he make a century, to grow a beard of Sherwood Forest proportions, so the abrupt end to his sturdy knock, bowled by Glen Chapple, was bad news for those despairing of the current rash of slapheads and hankering after the new WG. </p> <p>After the way Kumble bowled, mind, that upper lip may soon be restored to its familiar shrubbery. Playing into Crawley's deft hands, he strayed all too frequently to leg and waited 19 overs for his sole wicket. Perhaps this novel attempt to reverse the Samson principle is wearing off. </p> <p>Amid it all buzzed the Chris Lewis grapevine. The former England all-rounder is said to be so fed up with what he sees as the reluctance of officialdom to take his allegations of bookmaker approaches seriously that he is threatening to retire in order to \"write\" a book naming the England players he was asked to approach by a bookmaker. </p> <p>Not that Leicestershire would be distraught. Given that a hip ailment has restricted him to fewer than 100 championship overs, Lewis has been about as useful as Banquo's ghost, and only marginally more visible. Patience is thinning. </p> <p>\"It'll all come out in the wash,\" said Leicestershire's coach Jack Birkenshaw, somewhat obliquely. One can only guess whether Lewis is seeking revenge for a perceived slight, trying to earn a few bob for his dotage or has genuine cause to shatter English cricket's holier-than-thou self-image.</p>",
  "A Russian woman who was forcibly sedated after she shrieked abuse at a senior minister has become a potent symbol of Moscow's continuing intolerance of dissent. <p><a href=\"http://www.sky.com/news/world/story1.htm\" target=\"_new\">Images of the incident</a> have been broadcast and published throughout the world. They show the young blonde woman - the mother of one of the sailors who died horribly in the Kursk submarine - screaming her angry comments at Ilya Klebanov, the deputy prime minister in charge of investigating the disaster. An officer tries, without success, to calm the woman, before a nurse slides into the picture, clearly holding a hypodermic syringe. Moments later, the blond woman slumps to the ground, before being helped to a chair. </p> <p>Officials later suggested that the woman's sedation was motivated by compassion. That explanation is as crass as the sedation itself, which took place in full view of a local television crew. At least in Russia today the authorities cannot muzzle the media, though they can silence a protesting mother. </p> <p>In the Soviet era these things were organised better. The woman have been dealt with more swiftly and effectively, and the images would never have got out. In our own enlightened times, what happened was less sinister than bovinely stupid. And yet the incident raises all kinds of disturbing, fascinating questions about censorship and manipulation; about dissent and dissimulation. </p> <p>There is a western tendency to smugness when it comes to media freedom. We congratulate ourselves for being able to call Bill Clinton a fornicating liar or Tony Blair a grinning prat. That kind of freedom is indeed precious, but it is superficial. So far as the mainstream media are concerned, there are many sly and pernicious restraints on freedom, <a href=\"http://members.optusnet.com.au/~bfmedia/docs/chom.html\" target=\"_new\">most clearly explained</a> by the US intellectual giant Noam Chomsky. If we accept that our freedom is not total, we may understand better what happens elsewhere. For free expression is a highly subjective matter, and what we regard as a precious right may in some countries be seen as an intolerable abuse. </p> <p>India, for example, is a vigorous democracy. Its press is far from reverent, let alone obsequious. But on issues perceived to be of national importance, the Indian media tends instinctively to close ranks behind the government of the day. Kashmir is an obvious example: there can be strident criticism of day-to-day handling of the situation, but it is unthinkable that the mainstream media would question, let alone oppose, the notion that Kashmir is an indivisible part of India. </p> <p>Another interesting dichotomy is between the private sector press and the state controlled television service, <a href=\"http://www.ddindia.net/\" target=\"_new\">Doordarshan</a>. The broadcasters in theory enjoy the same freedoms as their print colleagues, but in practice their news bulletins are dreary recitals of what the prime minister has said and done that day. The same is true, with knobs on, in next-door Pakistan, where at least the broadcasters have the current excuse of labouring under a military junta. But it was just the same in the days of Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, both of whom insisted that the <a href=\"http://ptv-news.com.pk/\" target=\"_new\">Pakistan Television news</a> be little more than a court circular. </p> <p>This confusion of the state with its rulers is ubiquitous in the Third World, as the Channel 4 news team now in custody in Liberia has found to its cost. They were doing what they ought to do: asking awkward, probing questions. But when they started to gather material that might have been embarrassing for Liberia's strongman leader Charles Taylor, they tripped the wire that binds together Nation, Ruler and Authority. We might scoff when Liberian ministers talk of Channel 4's \"espionage\" but to a certain mindset that's exactly what their activity amounted to. </p> <p>In Russia and the former Eastern Bloc, elements of the same confusion exist more than a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was always naive to suppose that Western media standards could be <a href=\"http://www.mediastudies.org/atf.html#jakubowicz\" target=\"_new\">transplanted wholesale</a> into Eastern Europe - even if that was desirable. The region is still in <a href=\"http://www.mediastudies.org/atf.html#rubin\" target=\"_new\">a transitional stage</a>, in which even impeccable liberals like the Czech Republic's Vaclav Havel have <a href=\"http://www.mediastudies.org/atf.html#havel\" target=\"_new\">an instinctive distrust</a> of 'free' television. </p> <p>Indeed, rulers of every democratic hue, and of course despots of all kinds, are mesmerised by television. Its raw power to inform and to delude is undoubted, but in its conventional form it is the medium which, next to newspapers, those rulers can most easily control and manipulate. Oddly, the same rulers and manipulators have, for two generations at least, overlooked the much greater threat/opportunity of radio to subvert/inform. John Tusa, the former BBC World Service chief, strongly believes that it was radio, more than any other medium, which <a href=\"http://www.mediastudies.org/atf.html#jtusa\" target=\"_new\">brought down the Wall</a>. </p> <p>Now the internet is the new radio, along with satellite television and, to an extent, mobile telephony. The new media are no respecters of frontiers, or even of laws. They allow the most extravagant <a href=\"http://www.macronet.org/cia/ciadrugs.html\" target=\"_new\">conspiracy theories</a> to flourish and, of course, they can be used to explain in graphic detail how the mainstream media have been <a href=\"http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Media/MediaCensorship.html\" target=\"_new\">suborned by big business</a>. </p> <p>Impressive phrases such as\"<a href=\"http://valinor.purdy.wayne.edu/csyed_libres3.html\" target=\"_new\">the geopolitics of information</a>\" are woven into <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/8644/interneteng.htm\" target=\"_new\">earnest academic treatises</a> on the internet's impact <a href=\"http://www.politicsonline.com/archives/intnews/intnews2000.html\" target=\"_new\">on politics</a>, on the Third World and, for that matter, more or less any other aspect of life. </p> <p>The plain fact is that the net is more effective than any other medium for spreading news, views and images around the globe, with or without the permission of the kind of people who believe that distraught mothers should be sedated rather than give offence to a minister.</p>",
  "The return to prison of Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair may have been welcomed by law-abiding citizens in Northern Ireland, but he was the last person the prison officers at Maghaberry jail wanted to see. <p>Loyalist paramilitaries have threatened action against prison officers and their families unless segregation is introduced at the County Antrim jail. </p> <p>The prison operates a policy of integration, with loyalist and republican prisoners living side by side with other inmates. </p> <p>Sources with an intimate knowledge of Maghaberry said yesterday that staff feared he would become a rallying point for the loyalist prisoners, who are demanding the same rights as they were given inside the Maze. </p> <p>Following the suspension of his licence for early release, Adair was dragged from his car on the Shankill road on Monday night by officers from the RUC's SAS-trained headquarters mobile support unit. </p> <p>He was driven to Girdwood Barracks in Belfast, and flown to Maghaberry in a helicopter. </p> <p>Once hailed as a model prison, Maghaberry has become a powder keg since the Good Friday agreement was signed. It was built to house \"good honest criminals\" not associated with terrorism, but members of paramilitary groups convicted or charged after the agreement have been sent there instead of the Maze, due to close in the autumn. </p> <p>About 120 of the jail's 493 prisoners are affiliated to the Ulster Freedom Fighters and Loyalist Volunteer Force, a breakaway group set up by the infamous Portadown loyalist Billy Wright, who was shot dead in the Maze prison by the INLA two days after Christmas in 1997. </p> <p>It was a spokesman for the LVF prisoners, who do not qualify for early release as the terrorist organisation has not declared a ceasefire, who issued the threat against the prison staff and their families. </p> <p>Since Adair was freed from the Maze last September after serving five years of a 16-year sentence for directing terrorism, he has tried to forge close links with the LVF to muscle in on the lucrative drugs trade in Portadown. </p> <p>Adair has publicly aligned himself with the LVF prisoners' demands, and prison sources fear a worsening of the violence that has already seen more than 60 officers injured in Maghaberry this year and several petrol bomb attacks on their homes. </p> <p>But the prison authorities are adamant that they will not introduce the policies that resulted in the Maze being run by inmates. </p> <p>The Maze was a home from home for Adair, who even had a mobile phone to direct operations on the streets of Belfast. </p> <p>Maghaberry remains a much stricter regime than the H blocks. Yesterday the Northern Ireland prison service stressed that mobile phones were not tolerated in the jail and that Adair would be afforded no special privileges.</p>",
  "As well as breaking the hearts of Camelot executives, yesterday's lottery announcement shattered two golden rules. First, nothing of political significance happens in August. Second, every government announcement is always briefed well in advance. New Labour's in-house newspaper, the Mirror, confidently reported yesterday that \"Camelot is today set to win the race to run the National Lottery again\". <p>And these were not the only unique aspects of the announcements. While Chris Smith only knew about the decision earlier this week, No 10 advisers apparently found out at the same time as the rest of us. </p> <p>Underlining the independence from political interference of the national lottery commission - and its improbably named chair Dame Helena Shovelton - is important for the government. Especially given that the decision to go with Branson is without question good news for New Labour. One of the most effective stories in Labour's 1997 election campaign was around the pledge to create a \"People's Lottery\". This pledge took up a whole section of Labour's manifesto. The measures in the 1998 Lottery Act committing distributors to focus more on social and regional need meant that the government was able to demonstrate it had met many of its promises. But the problem lay in the last line of the manifesto commitment: \"Labour will seek an efficient not-for-profit operator to ensure that the maximum sums go to good causes.\" The Branson bid, as well as shrewdly taking the title \"People's Lottery\" from Labour, fulfils this last pledge. </p> <p>So far so good. But while the success of the Branson bid is a result for the government, it doesn't end the controversy surrounding this national institution. While the likely establishment of the People's Lottery will be a useful addition to Labour's achievement list at next year's general election there are plenty of things that could go wrong in time to be an embarrassment in a Blair second term. </p> <p>For a start the new organisers of the lottery will be taking over a business in decline. Recently, lottery sales have been declining or stagnant. Branson may not take the \u00a3230m in profits reaped by Camelot but this figure represents only 1.5% of the money for good causes pledged by both Virgin and Camelot. A decline in lottery sales of less than 1% would more than offset the benefits of not retaining profits. So the People's Lottery will need to succeed and be seen to succeed. </p> <p>The second set of challenges concern legitimacy. Being not-for-profit helps but it doesn't solve as many problems as might appear. As trade union activists will tell you in the light of some general secretaries' salaries and perks, you don't have to be a capitalist to be a fat cat. The People's Lottery will still need senior executive and they will still be paid out of the proceeds. More fundamentally, the lottery will continue to be played disproportional by the poor. As the Right Rev Richard Harries, Bishop of Oxford, reminded us this week, many people maintain that the lottery is economically unfair, encourages gambling and fosters disempowering fantasies of escape amongst those at the bottom of the heap. </p> <p>But the main question of legitimacy will continue to be the way the money is spent. Camelot executives never tired of telling us that they had no control over this. Of course, they were right. The responsibility for the distribution of the money lies in the hands of culture secretary Chris Smith and is devolved by him to various bodies ranging from the arts councils to the millennium commission and the new opportunities fund. It is with these bodies that the responsibility for controversial decisions like the purchase of the Churchill papers or the huge grant to the Royal Opera House. But awards of this kind do undermine the overall popularity of the lottery as an (albeit highly inefficient) form of charitable giving. </p> <p>In relation to distribution, the funding bodies are stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand many on the left continue to defend the often breached pledge that the lottery should not be used for funding mainstream public services. On the other hand many on the right go into apoplexy when lottery money is given to \"politically correct\" charities like those giving advice to gays. This inevitable controversy points to why the decision to go with Branson could ultimately prove to be a double-edged sword. While Camelot has been only too willing to fall into line with government wishes in a desperate attempt to salvage its battered credibility, Branson continues to be one of the most popular people in Britain. If Sir Richard feels the administration of lottery money is damaging its success he will say so loud and clear and - given his highly polished PR skills - with popular support. After all, anyone who can remain popular and respected while running the west coast main line must be made of Teflon. If Branson takes on the government over the lottery the sparks will certainly fly. I can even predict the sound-bite when the first argument kicks off: \"this is not the New Labour lottery it is the People's Lottery\". </p> <p>\u0095 Matthew Taylor is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>New security procedures may soon make it safer to use your Visa card or MasterCard online than in person. From next April, all Visa card and MasterCard holders in the UK will have to give out a three-digit security number printed on the card signature strip during online and telephone based transactions. As an additional means of identification, they will also have to give their house name or number and postcode . </p> <p>The security number is calculated from your card's 16-digit number and other numeric data unique to your account. In theory, only cash machines, electronic point of sale machines and your card issuer's computer systems can confirm this number. </p> <p>Credit card fraud in the UK cost a staggering \u00a3189m last year, and is rising. </p> <p>Stolen till rolls or restaurant receipts are all that is needed for someone to take your card number and expiry date and then use your details for buying goods over the telephone or online. Alternatively, your card details can easily, and quickly, be copied by a less than scrupulous shop assistant using a simple magnetic strip reader costing around \u00a350. These gizmos, when hooked up to a laptop computer - which could easily be under the checkout - can record all of the existing data on your card. But they will not be able to record the new security number as it is printed on your signature strip. </p> <p>Thanks to the new security number, known as the card verification value, and the extra identification checks, Visa and MasterCard say it will be easier for online merchants and telephone mail-order houses to spot fraudulent card activity. </p> <p>Some UK online retailers, most notably Quip (<a href=\"http://www.quip.co.uk\">www.quip.co.uk</a>), the discount telecoms company, have already implemented the card verfication value and house number safeguards, so if you do find these details requested when you make a transaction over the phone or online, rest assured that it's for your own protection. If, on the other hand, you see a shop assistant or waiter noting down the card verfication value or other data from the signature strip of your card, alarm bells should start ringing in your head. Don't be afraid of asking for an explanation and if necessary calling for the manager. </p> <p> The \"consumer tips\" section on Visa's main website (which is at <a href=\"http://www.visa.com/ct\">www.visa.com/ct</a>) has a useful selection of dos and don'ts for when using your card at a retailer, online or at a cash machine. </p> <p>Many recommendations are commonsense, but some are less than obvious, such as cancelling a cash machine transaction at any stage if you see anything suspicious about the machine, a simple procedure that can save a lot of hassle. </p> <p>Visa also recommends that you don't let your card out of your sight in a shop or a restaurant. Although this can involve a trip to the till from your table, the minor inconvenience could save a lot of grief further down the line. </p> <p>Not all problematic transactions are fraudulent. Suppose you order a product online and nothing arrives at all. Or, perhaps, the product arrives, but your bill is for more than you agreed. Unravelling these messes takes time and effort, not to mention a lot of brain strain. </p> <p>Now a new web-based service aims to solve these problems by providing a service which allows you to prove to your card issuer - and to the online retailer - what really happened. The Card-Guard (<a href=\"http://www.card-guard.com\">www.card-guard.com</a>) service allows all types of e-commerce transactions, including Switch and Visa Delta, to be securely recorded on a your PC for later playback. </p> <p>The Card-Guard software sits in the background on your PC, recording any transactions you make. Copies of these transactions are then encrypted and saved to your hard disk. </p> <p>If a dispute occurs, you simply send a copy of the encrypted transaction to Card-Guard. The firm then allows you secure access to the decrypted copy. Basically, if something goes wrong with a transaction you can prove your side of the story. </p> <p>The service is free to use except when users retrieve their encrypted transaction records from the company's servers, for which it charges a modest fee. </p> <p>There are currently two ways of paying for this service: a pay-as-you-go model at \u00a35.50 per retrieved transaction or an annual subscription model for prepaid transaction retrievals. </p> <p>The first charging model allows users to test the service and, if nothing goes wrong with any of your online transactions, you won't have to pay a penny. </p> <p>Under the subscription model, users can pay either \u00a317.50 or \u00a335 a year for, respectively, 10 or 20 free transaction retrievals in that given year. </p> <p>Plans are also in the pipeline for the company to develop an approved retailers programme on its site. Under the programmme, users will be assured of a basic level of service from such approved retailers. Users will get confirmation of their orders by e-mail and several other guaranteed services. These are basic features which many e-commerce sites ignore at their peril. </p> <p><strong>Card safety</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Ensure that you get your credit card back after every purchase. If possible, do not let it out of your sight. </p> <p>\u0095 Never give your card number over the phone, unless you are dealing with a reputable company or you have initiated the call yourself. </p> <p>\u0095 If you feel pressured by a tele-marketing salesperson, be suspicious and never give out your account number unless you've decided to make a purchase. </p> <p>\u0095 Do not volunteer any personal information when you use your card. </p> <p>\u0095 After completing an ATM or Debit transaction, remember to take your card and, if provided, your transaction record </p> <p>\u0095Make sure that anyone waiting to use a cash machine after you cannot see you entering your PIN or transaction amount. </p> <p>\u0095 Never write down your PIN - memorise it. And never disclose it to anyone. No one from a financial institution or the police should ask for it. Nor should a retailer. You are the only person who should know it. </p> <p>\u0095 When selecting a PIN, avoid the obvious such as your name, telephone number, or date of birth. </p> <p>\u0095 If your card becomes stuck inside a cash machine, be suspicious of anyone offering help, even if they appear to be a bank security officer. Criminals can obtain your PIN by several means (shoulder surfing or straight questioning), then retrieve your card from the machine and use it to withdraw funds. </p> <p>\u0095 Do not leave your receipt behind - take it with you. Compare your cash machine receipts to your monthly statement. </p> <p>All the advice above was taken from the Visa website at: <a href=\"http://www.visa.com\">www.visa.com</a>.</p>",
  "Six people were being questioned today after a 21-year-old man was shot dead in Belfast - the latest victim of the worsening feud between loyalist terror groups. <p>Sam Rocket was visiting his girlfriend and one-year-old daughter in the Old Park area of the city when he was attacked by an unknown number of gunmen. </p> <p>Rocket is thought to have been a friend of the son of Billy Hutchinson of the Progressive Unionist party, the political arm of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). The attack is thought to have been carried out by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) as revenge for the murder of two men on Monday.</p> <p>Hardline loyalists warned today that they expected the feud to continue. \"There are those on both sides hellbent on continuing it until they feel they have drawn enough blood,\" said Mr Hutchinson.</p> <p>The UDA and UVF are both supposed to be observing a joint ceasefire in support of the Good Friday Peace agreement. </p> <p>The Rocket family had been linked to the UDA, but were expelled in the mid-1990s. Some family members had since realigned themselves with the UVF. </p> <p>Police arrested six more people last night after a chase on Belfast's Shankill Road. A submachine gun, a rifle, a shotgun and three handguns were found abandoned on the pavement. </p> <p>John White, chairman of the Ulster Democratic party, warned that Rocket would not be the last to die. \"This is something I was expecting. And I don't see an end to it,\" he said. \"I'm not condemning it,\" said Mr White, convicted of a double murder in 1972.</p>",
  "Former Chinese slave labourers have launched a test case in the US against two leading Japanese companies, claiming that they were submitted to inhuman treatment during the second world war. <p>The claim, filed yesterday against the Mitsubishi and Mitsui groups in a Los Angeles court, revives memories of Japan's extensive use of Chinese and Korean forced labour. </p> <p>Harsh conditions and lack of food in virtual prison camps resulted in perhaps hundreds of thousands of deaths, in their countries and in Japan. </p> <p>The case has been launched by four Chinese-Americans now living in California, and five residents of Beijing. The US lawyer Barry Fisher said yesterday that \"this is a suit on behalf of Chinese people victimised during the war.

  "Divers have retrieved the two \"black box\" recorders from the Gulf Air Airbus A320 which crashed into the sea last night, killing all 143 people on board, an airline official said today. <p>The rescue teams, which included US Navy helicopters and destroyers, managed to reach the wreckage of the plane - lying in shallow waters a few miles off the northern coast of Bahrain - within hours, but there were no survivors. </p> <p>Two Britons and 36 children are among those who died on board GF072, an evening flight from Cairo to Manama. Relatives spent the morning identifying victims of the crash from photos taken after all the bodies were recovered. </p> <p>There was no immediate word on what caused the crash. Ali Ahmadi, a Gulf Air vice president, said investigations have begun, but Bahraini officials will wait for experts from France's Airbus Industrie and the US-based national transportation safety board for a more thorough probe. </p> <p>The aircraft, which Gulf Air said was carrying 135 passengers and eight crew, crashed north of Bahrain airport at about 5.30pm yesterday.</p> <p>Most of the passengers were Arab nationals - including 63 Egyptians, 34 Bahrainis, 12 Saudi Arabians, nine Palestinians, six United Arab Emirates nationals, a Kuwaiti and an Omani. There were also two Britons, an Australian, a Canadian, three Chinese people, one Sudanese national and a Korean. There were also unconfirmed reports that one of the passengers was a US diplomatic courier. </p> <p>It is not yet known why flight GF072 crashed but an air traffic controller at Bahrain airport described watching from the tower as the plane circled the runway twice in an attempt to land, then on the third attempt plunged into the sea and exploded into flames. </p> <p>The controller, who asked to remain anonymous, saw no sign of trouble before the crash and said the plane's crew had not reported anything out of the ordinary. </p> <p>However, the ministry of transportation in Bahrain released a statement saying reports of an engine fire was \"pure speculation\". </p> <p>The statement said: \"It appeared that the aircraft had made two previous attempts to land and as it was turning to make another approach, it veered into the sea. </p> <p>\"Contrary to some initial reports, suggestions that an engine was on fire is pure speculation. The Air Traffic Control recordings confirm the crew made no distress call.\" </p> <p>US navy helicopters based in Bahrain, the home of the US fifth fleet, joined the rescue operation last night, according to a Pentagon spokesman, Bryan Whitman. The Catawba, a US navy support ship with a dive team, is also being dispatched to the scene. About 100 US military personnel were sent to help from the USS George Washington - which usually patrols the Gulf but was in port - at the request of the Bahraini government, said Lieutenant John Perkins, a navy spokesman. </p> <p> A Foreign Office spokesman could not confirm last night whether Britons were on board. Gulf Air urged worried relatives to call the information line on 0845 604 0171. </p> <p>Bahrain's ruler, Sheikh Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, said last night that he had ordered an investigation into the crash. He also announced a three-day mourning period for the crash victims.</p> <p>Paul Beaver, a Jane's defence specialist, said: \"Gulf Air has been going for 40 years and has an excellent safety record.

  "Former MI5 officer David Shayler was today formally charged in court with breaking the Official Secrets Act and bailed. <p>He was bailed on the condition that he lived with his brother Philip in Wimbledon, south-west London, and was also given permission to stay with a friend on Teesside so he could watch Saturday's match against Leeds United at the Riverside Stadium. </p> <p>Mr Shayler appeared calm and relaxed as he stood in the dock of court one at Bow Street magistrates court, central London.</p> <p>Outside the court he said he was \"very glad\" the legal process had got under way, adding: \"I'm very glad that the magistrate was sympathetic enough to me to let go and see Middlesbrough.\" </p> <p>He faces two charges of breaking section one of the 1989 Official Secrets Act, over an article in the Mail on Sunday in which he made allegations about his former employer, MI5. </p> <p>In the article, he claimed that security chiefs had kept files on prominent Labour politicians, including Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson, Home Secretary Jack Straw - who was described as a \"communist sympathiser\" - and had also kept files on former Beatle John Lennon and punk band the Sex Pistols. The formal charge read: \"On or before the 24th day of August 1997 within the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court being a person who has been a member of the security and intelligence services without lawful authority disclosed documents relating to security or intelligence which were in your possession by virtue of your position.\" </p> <p>Mr Shayler's solicitor John Wadham, of the civil rights group Liberty, told the magistrate that the 34-year-old former agent would be pleading not guilty at a later hearing.</p> <p>Mr Shayler claims that his allegations were made in the public interest and did not damage national security.

  "<p>Marcello Lippi, the man who Alex Ferguson rates as the \"best coach in Europe,\" is facing the sack today after his Internazionale side crashed out of the Champions League to Swedish part-timers Helsingborg.</p> <p>Despite losing the first leg 1-0, Inter went into the return match at the San Siro last night expecting a comfortable victory. But although they ripped through the Swedes' defensive line time and time again, they found Helsingborg's 36-year-old keeper Sven Andersson in sensational form.</p> <p>He was called into action as early as the 10th minute, straining to reach a Zamorano header that crept just wide. And the barrage continued as twice in the space of two minutes Pirlo wriggled free of his markers to set up first Zamorano and then himself with good shooting opportunities.</p> <p>At the start of the second half, Pirlo and Zamorano were replaced by Recoba and Keane, but Inter's onslaught continued. Keane hit the post with a back-heel in the 52nd minute and then was brilliantly denied 10 minutes later by Andersson after he followed up a fierce Jugovic shot.</p> <p>As the game entered injury time, Inter looked dead and buried. But then, suddenly, they were awarded a penalty. The 50,000 in the San Siro went wild: they were back in it. Recoba stepped to take it and fired the ball low and hard to Andersson's right. </p> <p>But the Swedish keeper - once again - was equal to it. Lowly Helsingborg had knocked out one of the biggest names in European football from the Champions League, and they couldn't quite believe it.</p> <p> \"The last 15 minutes we were on our knees,\" admitted Andersson. \"It was bloody warm down there on the pitch. When the referee awarded the penalty, I thought that was it. We had been fighting for 90 minutes and we get a bloody penalty against us.\"</p> <p>\"I thought that I had to save the penalty. It would have been awful if we had lost this tie in the final minute after fighting so hard for 180 minutes. We were so tired we would never got through any extra time.\"</p> <p>Helsingborg manager Nanne Bergstrand - who has come under criticism after a poor spell of results - sounded like a vindicated man. \"This is the greatest thing that has happened in the history of the club,\" he said. \"I'm astonished about the way we had energy to work hard through the entire game. It's amazing considering we've been playing three games a week for the last seven weeks.\"</p> <p>His opposite number Lippi, by contrast, looked defeated and disconsolate. \"Our dreams are broken,\" he admitted. \"We are out and we have lost to a team who we know we are better than.\" </p> <p>But later he tried to sound upbeat: \"We have to put that behind us and go on,\" he claimed. \"As for my situation, you have to talk with the president and with the club executives. I cannot answer for them.\"</p> <p>But if the fans that stoned the Inter bus have anything to say then Lippi will be out of a job. The only consolation he has is that there's no obvious replacement waiting in the wings - but given club president Massimo Moratti's habit of sacking managers, even that might not save him.</p>",

  "The bitter feud between rival loyalist factions in Belfast is threatening to escalate further after another man was shot dead last night. <p>The shooting came 27 hours after the re-arrest of Ulster Freedom Fighter boss Johnny Adair, who vowed to fight the decision to send him back to jail. </p> <p>The victim, 21-year-old Sam Rocket, was gunned down last night just a few hundred yards from the scene of a double murder by the UVF on Monday. </p> <p>Bobby Mahood, a close associate of Adair, and fellow militant Jackie Coulter, were shot in Belfast's Crumin Road. Mr Mahood will be buried today. </p> <p>Mr Rocket was was shot as he sat in the living room of his girlfriend's home in Summer Street, off Cliftonpark Avenue on the north of the city, and died in hospital a short time later. His young daughter was also believed to have been in the room at the time of the attack. His family were reportedly expelled from the Ulster Defence Association - aligned to the UFF - in the mid-1990s and had switched allegiance to the rival Ulster Volunteer Force. The finger is already being pointed at the UFF, who blamed the UVF for the murders of Mr Mahood and Mr Coulter. </p> <p>Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson condemned last night's murder as a \"cowardly act bringing the loyalist feud to new depths\". </p> <p>Mr Mandelson yesterday stood by his decision to send \"Mad Dog\" Adair back to prison. </p> <p>The UFF leader is planning legal action to overturn the decision and met his legal team at Co Antrim's Maghaberry prison to make preparations for a possible high court judicial review. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson promised to fight any court action. He said: \"I will maintain my decision in whatever forum I have to. I am entirely confident I was right.</p> <p>\"There is always a risk that maverick individuals will want to pursue this blood feud and we must be on our guard. But over time I believe the removal of Mr Adair will cause tension to subside. </p> <p>\"The Shankill community leaders I have been speaking to have said things are calm on the ground. There is no sense of any backlash.\" </p> <p>He insisted recent violence did not mean the loyalist ceasefires had been broken, because he argued, an individual's wrongdoing was not necessarily directed by an organisation. </p> <p>\"By no means do all the UDA or UFF support or subscribe to the actions of Johnny Adair,\" he said. </p> <p>Police yesterday questioned a man in connection with the double murder but released him without charge. </p> <p>John White, of the Ulster Democratic Party, the UFF's political wing, said: \"I have been trying to encourage people to start talking again. I have been told in no uncertain terms there will be no talking. The UFF want to extract their retribution.\" </p> <p>Progressive Unionist Billy Hutchinson, whose party represents the rival Ulster Volunteer Force, said: \"I think both organisations need to take a step back and look at where they are going but I would be concerned there will be more attacks. </p> <p>\"I understand that people will want revenge but there will have to be mediation eventually between the two organisations. </p> <p>The sentence review commission will now examine Mr Mandelson's decision, taking written submissions from both the secretary of state and Adair's legal team.

  "An unidentified gunman shot to death a Protestant man at a house on Summer Street in a Loyalist area of north Belfast late last night, in what appeared to be the latest blow in a vicious feud between rival pro-British gangs. <p>Although no group claimed immediate responsibility, the fatal shooting happened only a few hundred yards from the spot where the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force shot dead two Protestant militants on Monday, among them a prominent member of the rival Ulster Defense Association. The UDA had vowed to retaliate by killing UVF supporters in the area. </p> <p>Despite the rising violence, Northern Ireland minister Peter Mandelson, insisted that a joint UDA-UVF cease-fire remained intact. Speaking before the latest shooting, Mandelson said he had no doubt that most commanders of the UDA and UVF did not want their feud to degenerate into a total breakdown of their 1994 truce, a pillar of Northern Ireland's shaky peace accord. </p> <p>\"It is possible for an organization to be on cease-fire but for individuals associated with it to be involved in unlawful activity,\" he said. </p> <p>Mandelson also defended his decision on Tuesday to order the immediate arrest and reimprisonment of the most notorious militant, Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair, who was seized at police gunpoint and delivered by helicopter back to prison. The brawny UDA commander was paroled early from prison last year under terms of the 1998 peace accord, but he had been accused of stoking up an increasingly violent turf war with UVF members, particularly in his Shankill Road power base. </p> <p>Adair led a raucous UDA parade up the Shankill Road last weekend, inspiring gun attacks on a UVF-linked pub and several leading UVF members' homes. The UVF retaliated on Monday by fatally shooting two men, one of them an Adair subordinate, as they sat in a parked car on the nearby Crumlin Road. </p> <p>Britain deployed police and troops into the Shankill district to deter an expected UDA counterstrike. Last night's shooting on a residential street just off the Crumlin Road happened not far from a joint police-army checkpoint. No arrests were reported in response. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a Protestant man being questioned about involvement in Monday's lethal shootings was freed late Wednesday without charge. Detectives continued to question five others arrested on Monday during police raids on houses that contained eight guns and ammunition. Two were scheduled to appear in court today to face charges of illegal arms possession.</p> <p>Had Mandelson ruled that the joint UDA-UVF truce had broken down, he could have ordered more than 150 convicted members of both groups to be returned to prison to continue serving their suspended sentences. Instead, he focused criticism on Adair, calling him the leading member of a small group of \"gangsters and thugs who operate on the black side of Northern Ireland society.\" </p> <p>He said Adair had been \"given a chance to go straight,\" but had instead \"whipped up the feud.\" The viability of the Good Friday peace accord depends in part on the maintainance of cease-fires by the Irish Republican Army, which draws support from the most militant Catholic areas, and Protestant-based gangs such as the UDA and UVF. Before calling their joint cease-fire, those two Protestant groups were responsible for slaying more than 800 Catholic civilians. </p> <p>The cease-fire period has seen rivalry rise between the two groups, particularly once Adair returned home to the Shankill last year. Adair, 36, was convicted in 1994 of \"directing terrorism,\" a previously unheard-of charge, after being taped by undercover police officers bragging about his pivotal role in terrorizing Belfast Catholics. He served just five years of his 16-year sentence. </p> <p>Adair's close friend in the UDA-linked Ulster Democratic Party, John White, said Wednesday that lawyers had been hired to challenge Mandelson's reimprisonment order on grounds of lack of evidence. </p> <p>Adair's wife, Gina, insisted her husband was being unfairly singled out. \"There's loads of people out there inciting violence. Why just John?\" she said. \"Because of who he is.\" </p> <p>But Mandelson said he didn't expect Adair to get back out any time soon. He said senior police and army commanders agreed Adair \"poses too great a threat to public safety to be allowed to roam around and spread the sort of mayhem and terror that we have seen in recent days and weeks.\"</p>",

  "<p>The advice could scarcely have come from a more surprising source. \"If anyone tells you that GM is going to feed the world,\" Steve Smith, a director of the world's biggest biotechnology company, Novartis, insisted, \"tell them that it is not... To feed the world takes political and financial will - it's not about production and distribution.\" </p> <p>Mr Smith was voicing a truth which most of his colleagues in biotechnology companies have gone to great lengths to deny. On a planet wallowing in surfeit, people starve because they have neither the land on which to grow food for themselves nor the money with which to buy it. There is no question that, as the population increases, the world will have to grow more, but if this task is left to the rich and powerful - big farmers and big business - then, irrespective of how much is grown, people will become progressively hungrier. Only a redistribution of land and wealth can save the world from mass starvation. </p> <p>But in one respect Mr Smith is wrong. It is, in part, about production. A series of remarkable experiments has shown that the growing techniques which his company and many others have sought to impose upon the world are, in contradiction to everything we have been brought up to believe, actually less productive than some of the methods developed by traditional farmers over the past 10,000 years. </p> <p>Last week, Nature magazine reported the results of one of the biggest agricultural experiments ever conducted. A team of Chinese scientists had tested the key principle of modern rice-growing (planting a single, hi-tech variety across hundreds of hectares) against a much older technique (planting several breeds in one field). They found, to the astonishment of the farmers who had been drilled for years in the benefits of \"monoculture\", that reverting to the old method resulted in spectacular increases in yield. Rice blast - a devastating fungus which normally requires repeated applications of poison to control - decreased by 94%. The farmers planting a mixture of strains were able to stop applying their poisons altogether, while producing 18% more rice per acre than they were growing before. </p> <p>Another paper, published in Nature two years ago, showed that yields of organic maize are identical to yields of maize grown with fertilisers and pesticides, while soil quality in the organic fields dramatically improves. In trials in Hertfordshire, wheat grown with manure has produced higher yields for the past 150 years than wheat grown with artificial nutrients. </p> <p>Professor Jules Pretty of Essex University has shown how farmers in India, Kenya, Brazil, Guatemala and Honduras have doubled or tripled their yields by switching to organic or semi-organic techniques. A study in the US reveals that small farms growing a wide range of plants can produce 10 times as much money per acre as big farms growing single crops. Cuba, forced into organic farming by the economic blockade, has now adopted this as policy, having discovered that it improves both the productivity and the quality of its crops. </p> <p>Hi-tech farming, by contrast, is sowing ever graver problems. This year, food production in Punjab and Haryana, the Indian states long celebrated as the great success stories of modern, intensive cultivation, has all but collapsed. The new crops the farmers there have been encouraged to grow demand far more water and nutrients than the old ones, with the result that, in many places, both the ground water and the soil have been exhausted. </p> <p>We have, in other words, been deceived. Traditional farming has been stamped out all over the world not because it is less productive than monoculture, but because it is, in some respects, more productive. Organic cultivation has been characterised as an enemy of progress for the simple reason that it cannot be monopolised: it can be adopted by any farmer anywhere, without the help of multinational companies. Though it is more productive to grow several species or several varieties of crops in one field, the biotech companies must reduce diversity in order to make money, leaving farmers with no choice but to purchase their most profitable seeds. This is why they have spent the last 10 years buying up seed breeding institutes and lobbying governments to do what ours has done: banning the sale of any seed which has not been officially - and expensively - registered and approved. </p> <p>All this requires an unrelenting propaganda war against the tried and tested techniques of traditional farming, as the big companies and their scientists dismiss them as unproductive, unsophisticated and unsafe. The truth, so effectively suppressed that it is now almost impossible to believe, is that organic farming is the key to feeding the world. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk\">g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Muslim rebels fighting to create a hardline Islamic state in central Asia were yesterday closing in on the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, after battling their way across three countries. <p>Up to 200 gunmen, who crossed into the country at the weekend, fought their way to within 60 miles of the capital, killing several Uzbek soldiers. </p> <p>Last night they were hiding in Bostanlyk, a holiday resort north-east of Tashkent.

The board rejected the plan as unnecessary to the company's future but invited him to put \"serious\" business suggestions. </p> <p>Phill Brown, a director of Enterprise Asia, said last night: \"The only conclusion we can draw from Mr Dean's refusal to take up any of our offers to demonstrate a genuine interest in the strategic direction of the company is that he wants to grab the cash and run.\"</p>",
  "\u0095More bad news for Big Brother's \"Nasty Nick\". First he lost his chance of winning \u00a370,000 when he was booted out of the house, and now it looks like he's lost a similar amount from the Sun. <p>Two female journalists from The Mirror tracked Nick to a hotel in Surrey (where the Sun had hidden him after signing him up for \u00a370,000) and got him to unwittingly spill the beans for nothing. </p> <p>As it happens, Sun executives are grumbling that Nick hasn't been worth the money, as he has had nothing of interest to say... which is not surprising really, since everything has already been on TV. </p> <p>By yesterday the Sun was scraping the barrel by \"revealing\" that Bateman was at the same school as Prince Edward... zzzzz. </p> <p>Noises from Wapping suggest the exclusive hasn't made the Sun fly off the news-stands - so the Mirror's spoiler gives News International a perfect excuse to refuse to pay up, on the grounds that Nick broke his confidentiality agreement when he fell into the Mirror's honey trap. </p> <p>It really couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. </p> <p>\u0095Cockney rhyming slang has added so much colour to the rich tapestry of the English language. So let's welcome the latest addition to the argot doing the rounds on the streets of London: \"I'll meet you by Euan at 8.30.\" Euan Blair - Leicester Square! </p> <p>\u0095Letters continue to flood in on the subject of the Keswick Pencil Museum. At a rough estimate I'd say that half of the Guardian's readership have visited the museum at some time or another. </p> <p>One of them was Claire Milhench, who tips another top tourist attraction in the Lake District. \"I have strong memories of a rainy afternoon in the Stott Park Bobbin Mill at Newby Bridge,\" says Claire. </p> <p>\"The presentation was basically a shed with boards explaining how bobbins are made, in mind-numbing detail.\" </p> <p>Admission is charged, although dogs get in free. </p> <p>\u0095And yet, as in so many other things, Europe leads the way in museums of this sort. Even the Yelverton Paperweight Centre is put in the shade by Belgium's Musee de l'Eau, \"almost bordering Lake Genval\" according to the leaflet sent to us by Patrick Kirby. \"The museum is also fun for children; a working model with 'real' water brings the whole water cycle to life.\" </p> <p>'Real' water, eh? Fancy that. </p> <p>\u0095A judge in the Punjab recently sentenced a man to be hanged twice, for killing his mother and father-in-law. The man's accomplice got off somewhat more lightly - he will only be executed once. </p> <p>\u0095From the letters column of the latest issue of the BBC's in-house magazine, Ariel: \"Have any other sad people out there,\" writes Alan McAllister, \"noticed that the first three notes of The Corrs's Breathless sound exactly the same as a Beta SP machine syncing up to 1kHz tone on playback?\" </p> <p>Probably not. But I suspect Mr McAllister has visited the Pencil Museum. </p> <p>\u0095An unlikely item in last Sunday's New York Times fashion supplement suggests the hysteria over paedophiles here is getting weird. </p> <p>During a fashion shoot in Llanberis, Wales (black and white hounds-tooth wool jacket, $812), the photographer asked some youngsters if he could use them in the pictures, with some cheekily asking for a \u00a32 fee. </p> <p>One of the kids \"must have gone to his mom,\" the NYT reports. \"The mom contacts the police. They're on the lookout for a pervert in a blue van taking pictures of kids for \u00a32.\" </p> <p>\u0095It's sad to report that Sun editor David Yelland still hasn't called to retrieve his old C&amp;A anorak, rescued by the Diary from a dusty corner of the Northern Echo, complete with lovingly handsewn \"Yelland D\" label. </p> <p>So the anorak will be offered to David on air during Radio 5's Sunday Service this weekend (hosted by the charming Fi Glover) ... and if he doesn't want it, it will go to Piers Morgan. </p>",
  "<p>For the last year we've been making a documentary called Movie Virgins, following Leon Herbert and Alex Jovy (pictured) trying to get their first feature films off the ground. Leon's is a no-budget domestic drama, Alex's is a clubland thriller with a \u00a33m budget. We've followed them writing scripts, raising money (or not), casting (or getting turned down), getting nowhere, getting somewhere, then the momentous, almost unbelievable first day on set... the shoots, the escalating costs, the tantrums and the traumas of seeing if what was in the script worked in the cutting room. </p> <p>Movie Virgins was allocated a prime-time 9pm slot by Channel 4, and we wanted, above all, to make it accessible. In the cutting room we were ourselves trying to weave hours of documentary footage into a four-part story. It was a challenge in the first place to start filming unknowns with incomplete scripts and no budget, just hoping to get them from script to screen. As Leon and Alex were trying to complete their features and meet deadlines, our own transmission date was looming. So where to end the documentary? Their stories were still going on. Then a fax arrived from Channel 4. The Sunday movie was being moved to the earlier 9pm slot, with Movie Virgins to follow. And with a different start time each week, which makes it hard to build an audience. We protested - to no avail. </p> <p>Still, Movie Virgins had good reviews (\"I'm hooked\", \"compelling as a car crash\", \"enthralling\") and doubled its audience from week one. Strangers approached in the street - to commiserate with Alex about being snubbed by Jude Law in Cannes, and even to offer Leon tenners to help him finish his film. People were saying they'd stay up to watch what happened next instead of videoing. There was a buzz. Then last Friday we summarily received a call from the Channel 4 schedulers. Movie Virgins, we were told, was being ejected from the schedules to make room for a repeat of an update on Nasty Nick's own eviction... </p> <p> Movie Virgins, Sunday, 10.55pm, C4</p>",
  "<p>Live television, as anyone from Noel Edmonds to Chris Evans to Nasty Nick will tell you, is a risky game at the best of times. With the added pressure of lines to remember, cues to miss, and the constraints of just a week in which to put it all together, tomorrow night's episode of ALT-TV, Play In A Week, is packed with drama before the actors even open their mouths. </p> <p>For the final instalment of the experimental ALT-TV series, writer Nigel Forde has been set the task of writing, casting and directing a half-hour play in a week - the first drama to air live on British television in a long time. </p> <p>On Monday he scoured the papers for a newsworthy story to base his script on. Tuesday, the cast was booked and thrown into rehearsals. Yesterday a composer was found to write the soundtrack, while Norman Stone, director of the TV version of Shadowlands, prepared to direct the cast and crew through what has the potential, at least, to be one of the more interesting half hours in this summer's TV schedules. </p> <p>Of course, in the days before edit suites and videotape existed, this was how all TV drama was made, filming what were essentially live theatre productions straight to camera. In the mid-60s, Dennis Potter cut his cathode teeth writing a bold series of live Wednesday Plays like Where The Buffalo Roam or The Confidence Course, packed with British actors like Yootha Joyce and Stanley Baxter. Some of these are lost gems which weren't even taped on transmission as the film stock was considered too expensive to be used for creating a huge library of material - a broadcasting strategy that seems bizarre in our era of endless chances to see stuff we didn't want to watch first time round. </p> <p>In the States, shows such as 1956's Playhouse 90 gave directors like John Frankenheimer an hour and a half of live television every week in which to adapt works from heavy weights Ernest Hemingway, George Bernard Shaw and William Faulkner, as well as nurturing young writers like The Twilight Zone's Rod Serling. The series is still regarded as one of the highpoints of the golden age of American television, which may explain the small but growing trend towards live TV drama in recent years. </p> <p>ER was the first to pull off the live show stunt, with the opening episode of the 1997 season featuring a documentary crew shooting the bloodthirsty chaos of Chicago's most famous hospital for a day. The cameramen jumped out of the way of bodies on gurneys, captured a few intimate moments between Carol and Doug, and generally contrived ways to film the high-paced drama in a continuous stream. Because of the five-hour time difference between the east and west coasts, the cast even had to repeat the performance after a two-hour break. </p> <p>It's an experience that the show's then star George Clooney obviously enjoyed, as he decided to repeat the endeavour in April this year by throwing his Hollywood clout behind a remake of his \"favourite film\". </p> <p>Originally broadcast live in 1964, Fail Safe is a cold-war nuclear paranoia thriller about an airforce bomber that has inadvertently been given the order to nuke Russia. Hardly a burning contemporary issue, but given the bonus thrill of live transmission, one that commanded a respectable enough audience. Clooney roped in his ER pal Noah Wyle alongside Richard Dreyfuss, Harvey Keitel, Don Cheadle and James Cromwell, with Stephen Frears directing 18 cameras across two soundstages. Fail Safe was such an extended exercise in repeating the past, they even went so far as to shoot it in black and white and broadcast it with a letterboxed picture. </p> <p>Both ER and Fail Safe were met with enthusiastic reviews, full of praise for the energy and vitality of the live experience - something of a novelty in today's culture of endless retakes and technical perfection. Both were also pulled off without any glaring mistakes from the cast, something which may have disappointed the rubbernecking section of the audience. It's undeniable that a major part of the thrill of live drama is waiting for someone to fluff their lines, especially in a format like television, where the audience is far enough removed from the cast to be able to revel in, rather than cringe at an actor's amnesia. </p> <p>This live aesthetic has spread to film, with Lars von Trier's Dogme 95 school of intimate wonky-cam directors offering a hardcore modern interpretation of cinema verit\u00e9 alongside the real-time experimentation of Mike Figgis's current Timecode - itself essentially a play that was filmed live, albeit from four different perspectives. </p> <p>It's an old idea, and one that used to be the only possibility available to TV directors. But the very fact that a show is being broadcast live still has the power to add an element of risk that's hard to match. And, if tomorrow night's Play In A Week is a success, it's a safe bet that it won't be the last time you see live and direct drama on TV. </p> <p>ALT-TV: Play In A Week, tomorrow, 7.30pm, Channel 4.</p>",
  "<p>After seeing Nick Moran on Movie Virgins a couple of weeks back acting like a spoilt Brit-flick brat on a Cannes rooftop terrace with Jude Law, the prospect of watching his nobody-ness in Hollywood seemed unmissable, his just desserts. But, as the excellent <strong> Starstruck</strong> (C4) continued its exploration of fame and fortune with a programme focusing on the price of celebrity and success, poor Nick's plight made him positively sympathetic. </p> <p>A koi carp in a swimming pool here, in LA he was a minnow in an ocean, just another British actor reading for bit parts in duff action movies. He may have got a free suit from Prada for the American premiere of Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, but he was small fry nonetheless. And he knew it. Like All Bran, humbling experiences may not taste great but they are good for you. </p> <p>With a supporting \"cast\" including Anjelica Huston, Adrian Lester and Billy Bob Thornton all giving insiders' critiques of the business we call show, Starstruck once again probed the inner workings of celebrity like a master surgeon. While all had interesting points to make - Rufus Sewell's anger at his cooperation with his own humiliation at auditions was particularly memorable - it was to Sienna Guilroy that Starstruck belonged. Nick Moran's girlfriend, she spoke candidly of how awful it is going out with someone everyone wants to know while you slowly turn invisible, three steps behind them. </p> <p>Incidentally, if that room in which Fay Ripley is interviewed for Starstruck is actually in her house - and not some swanky hotel suite - wouldn't it be great to be her flatmate? With all that space and nice coloured cushions, you could cartwheel from the dining table to the front windows at least three times without fear of smashing any ornaments. </p> <p>Unlike Lowri Turner's, which - if it is her house from which she presents <strong> The Lipstick Years</strong> (BBC2) - is jam-packed full of hideous ornaments culled from a jumble sale at Lady Tavistock's country pile. </p> <p>This week, concentrating on housewives, there were moments of The Lipstick Years which were surely cues for country and western songs. There was Shirley Conran's \"No One's Going To Strangle You If The Mantelpiece Is Dusty\", Nigella Lawson's \"I'm No Scrubber But I Bake A Mean Biscuit\", and my personal favourite, \"Feed The Baby, Load The Twin-Tub And Pass the Mogadon\". (Actually, there is a country song - by Mary Chapin Carpenter - called \"He Thinks He'll Keep Here\", which would have made a very good theme tune for this episode). </p> <p>The drum beats to which the righteous march, the synthesised trumpet noises suggesting heroic institutions, the urgent bass line hammering home an evangelical cause: the music for Crimewatch would prompt even Mad Dog McGough and Razors Robinson to phone in and say \"Keep up the good work.\" For fitting its programme like a comfy cardigan, Crimewatch comes second only to Casualty. And, just as Nick Ross saying \"Don't have nightmares. Do sleep well\" has absolutely no periaptic properties but is still oddly comforting, so the Crimewatch music irrationally stirs one's civic conscience. A call to arms, no less. </p> <p>These are the dog days of August however (the dogs having eaten the salad days) and there is no crime, so <strong> Crimewatch UK: Solved</strong> (BBC1) was dedicated to crimes \"you, the public\" helped solve. The happiest endings you could expect from some thoroughly nasty crimes (child abuse, murder, armed robbery and football hooliganism), it was part self-congratulatory and part public relations exercise for the police. This reconstruction-fest was full of cheeky, charming, non-swearing, non-racist, non-sexist policemen who must listen to the theme tune from Crimewatch on their personal stereos - after a chorus of Zip A Dee Do Dah - on their way to work. Knowing that the public probably wouldn't accept stations full of happy clappy coppers, there were - in a unique concession to reality - a couple of gruff types. They were Scottish, naturally. </p> <p>Whatever this bunch of officers were investigating, their gravitas was tempered by humour and their determination by concern for their victims. Naturally, one doesn't expect The Cops-esque drug-taking and corruption during Crimewatch, but this was The Bill on Prozac. Join the police - everyone's nice.</p>",
  "It is almost like a clich\u00e9 from a Mills &amp; Boon romance, but there is no escaping the reality that it was the passionflower cascading down the front of his handsome house beside the river Thames that changed the life of Leo Abse so completely and so unexpectedly. The old man was on his doorstep above the public towpath in Chiswick one sunny afternoon a couple of years ago when a beautiful young woman stopped to admire and ask about the flower. <p>He is the wealthy retired solicitor and former Labour MP who was once the author of much private member's legislation on homosexual, marriage and family law reform. More latterly, since leaving the House of Commons in 1987, he has written books about the psychology of politics. He is 83 years old. </p> <p>She is Ania Czeputkowska, a former electrician from Gdansk in Poland, who came to Britain without a word of English, acquired a diploma in general arts and design, took a degree and got a first while working as a cleaning lady, won a bursary to the Royal College of Arts to study printed and textile design and has now just been awarded her master's. She has sold designs for fabric production in New York and to one of Britain's best-known wallpaper firms. She is 33 years old, and three weeks ago in the rather unglamorous surroundings of Hounslow register office she married Leo Abse. They have returned from honeymoon in a castle at Sintra in Portugal; they are tanned and happy, and exude a delighted contentment in each other. It is an unusual and enchanting story. </p> <p>Leo Abse was widowed five years ago. Marjorie, his wife of more than 40 years and the mother of his two grown children, died and left him desolate. He cut a sorry, bereft figure. \"Although I was holding on, it was tough,\" he says. \"It was an arid period. You behave stoically, but not happily.\" He has two brothers: the poet Danny and an elder brother, Wilfred, a distinguished psychoanalyst in the United States who rather shocked him by suggesting that he should snap out of himself and find a young woman. \"I had thought, 'I'm going to die a widower and this is the way of life I have to endure until my death.' \" Wilfred changed his thinking, and shortly afterwards Ania strolled into his life. </p> <p>In some ways the attraction was a classic one. Her father died of cancer when she was just one year old. Her mother, an administrator with the Polish national transport system, never remarried and raised Ania and her elder brother alone. As a child, Anya was a brilliant mathematician but an undiagnosed dyslexic until the age of 18. She found her Polish examinations, in subjects except maths, incredibly difficult. She fled them one year to come to England with a friend and spent two happy months picking strawberries near Colchester, living in a tent. </p> <p>Although she went home and worked as a precision mechanic, repairing irons and hair dryers, then as a technical demonstrator in the physics department at Gdansk University, she wanted to return to Britain. She supplemented her income at home by working as a florist, or selling vegetables, or being a parking warden, and eventually came to study art and learn English in London. She had one or two boyfriends, but they were not serious or didn't work out. Leo, she says, was the first man to make her feel like a woman. </p> <p>She was fascinated by him when they met. She knew nothing of British politics and little of psychology. He invited her and her girlfriend for tea to talk about passionflowers, he asked them round for a meal and then again. Her girlfriend teased her that he was \"after her\", and she became suspicious. He took her to the Savile Club, bought her wine, sent her perfume and lent her books, and she became more uneasy. She turned down further invitations, sent the perfume back and returned the books with a note which read: \"I don't think I am the woman you are looking for.\" </p> <p>Three weeks later she telephoned him again, and this time allowed a relationship to develop. After a while, exhausted from cycling between her job, her flat, her college and his house, she decided to move in. He suited her. She wanted to look after him. \"I let go of all the suspicion and I started listening to him,\" she says. \"We have made an effort. We somehow understand each other and there is a friendship that has been built up in the last year - to know each other you have got to live with each other, to see each other every day.\" </p> <p>\"She is an all-or-nothing woman,\" says Leo, admiringly. He remembers the moment when he realised they were going to have to get married. \"Here was this woman who is enormously creative, who has an ability to battle through and to stand on her own feet, who is formidable and who has won her way to the most prestigious art college in the country and yet who has time to notice that my socks had holes in because my toenails needed cutting. It was when she was cutting my toenails that I realised I would have to marry Ania.\" </p> <p>They laugh delightedly at how prosaic this is. Neither of them is embarrassed about their love. Leo says that he is far too old to care what anybody else thinks and Ania is a woman who knows her own mind. </p> <p>Their homecoming has been a little marred, perhaps inevitably, by the excessive interest of the tabloid press. Leo Abse, with his fascination with psychoanalysis, understands this better than Ania, who has been tidying up the garden since they got back to Chiswick, filling nine bags with weeds and clippings rather than going out to face the intrusive lenses that have appeared from time to time on the doorstep. \"They really want a picture of her in a bikini,\" says Leo, chuckling with undisguised delight and mischief at his capacity to stir up controversy yet again. </p> <p>She, however, was a little upset and greatly astonished by the fact that in their absence on holiday the press pursued their friends and relatives across the continent. \"What disturbs them is the intergenerational relationship,\" says Leo. \"It can stir up fears. It is too near incest and the great taboo, of course, which has to be maintained to have an acceptable society is against incest. Freud said ...\" and he is off and away on his favourite subject. Ania listens with a commendable serenity for a while, until she starts to disagree. \"Hold on, Leo,\" she says. \"Hold on,\" she repeats when he doesn't hear her, for he is quite deaf. Then, if he still persists, she will put a restraining hand on his arm or raise her hand to him across the room in order to interrupt his flow and make a point. </p> <p>They disagree, for example, about babies. \"If it happens, it happens,\" he says. It is improbable in any case that they will start a family, he says, but Ania will be able to cope, just as her mother did; he means when he is not around to see any children of hers grow to adulthood. Ania says that she is more interested in her career, in sorting her priorities with the exciting possibilities that she has ahead. She is less certain about raising children on her own, however capable she is. </p> <p>In the meantime, there are other, more immediate hurdles: Leo's children need to get used to the idea of his changed circumstances; her mother has needed reassurance. And she wants to be able to emerge from her front door without being photographed. They chose to talk to the Guardian because they don't want their relationship sensationalised. They have nothing to hide and just wish to be free to continue walking hand in hand down life's towpath.</p>",
  "It was like a history lesson as we passed the 12th-century abbey at Fearn, the name derives from the Gaelic Fearnn meaning alder tree. Then, nearer the east coast, the remains of Cadboll Castle that was probably built around the same time although it could have been earlier. Cadboll means \"dwelling of the wildcats\" although I doubt very much whether there any true wildcats in the area these days. <p>The very impressive Glenmorangie House, now a hotel, adjacent to the castle was started in the 17th century but the reason for our visit was to see a much smaller structure in the grounds and built comparatively more recently. The doocot is a rectangular lectern type with a single sloping roof and the date on the lintel of the lower door indicated 1805 with the initials GR. This type of doocot superseded the older beehive type in the 16th and 17th century and they are unusual in that they are only found in Scotland and France. </p> <p>It was good to see doos flying in and out. The presence of two doors, one above the other, may indicate that the bottom part was used for another purpose such as keeping poultry or pigs. A much smaller hole in another wall was probably for taking out dung which was modified to make a form of gunpowder. The two walls on either side of the sloping roof project upwards above the slates to protect the doo entrance holes. Three of the walls had a double rat course which are projecting ridges to stop rats climbing up to the entrance holes. </p> <p>On the top of the doocot were five decorative round stone balls known as finials but the most striking feature was a three feet high metal silhouette shaped like a country gentleman in colourful breeches, boots and black hat and carrying a gun. One source said the figure was a weathervane whilst another said it was a scarecrow but my guess is that it was to scare off the birds of prey. </p> <p>Considering its age and apart from a few dislodged slates the doocot was in good condition and it was exciting to add it to our own inventory of doocots in the Highlands.</p>",
  "Anthony Ogbise, 81, is among the few who have remained in Odi after the destruction. The Nigerian army came in the early hours, razing house after house, but carefully bypassing the banks and government offices, until they got to his door. <p>\"They dragged me out and a captain said 'go and wash him', which meant they would kill me next to the river and dump me in the water. </p> <p>\"Somebody hit my arms and head with the butt of a gun. Another kicked me in the stomach. But they didn't kill me. They dragged me to their headquarters and beat me more. </p> <p>\"They used kerosene to burn the houses. I'm 81 years old. I'm not rich. I can't build a new house.\" </p> <p>There is not much left of Odi. Almost all its several thousand houses were burned by the soldiers. Hundreds of people were killed and buried in shallow graves beside the road. All but a few of the people fled. </p> <p>The destruction did not occur at the hands of one of Nigeria's repressive military dictatorships. It happened just nine months ago under the elected civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo. </p> <p>The government blamed the army. The army accused militant Ijaw youths of provoking the attack by murdering a group of policemen in the town. The youths said the government was to blame, because it failed to fulfil its promise of relief for the Niger delta. </p> <p>The region's misery is well documented. The 2m barrels of oil pumped from the delta each day provides more than 90% of Nigeria's foreign income. The delta communities have little to show for it beyond contamination, repression, and an ever more restless younger generation which has found violence, hostage-taking and extortion in place of jobs. </p> <p><b> Changes for the worse</b><br> </p> <p>Today the burnt-out houses stand as a monument to the failed hope that democratic rule would rescue the delta. Its blighted communities looked to the new government to ensure that the region benefited from the riches it gives up. But a bill to set up a development commission to return some of the oil profits to the delta is stuck in the national assembly, a victim of the endless feuding between MPs and President Obasanjo. </p> <p>\"Things haven't improved,\" said Oronto Douglas, one of the more militant of the Ijaw youth leaders and head of the Pan Niger Delta Resistance Movement. </p> <p>\"In some instances they've actually got worse. There is a general belief, especially in the west, that the coming to power of Obasanjo has changed things for the better. I would say he is practising dictatorial democracy. </p> <p>\"It is democracy designed by dictators and run by an ex-dictator for the benefit of the cronies and hangers on.\" </p> <p>Compounding the misery is the phenomenon of oil pipeline explosions. A month ago 312 villagers scooping fuel from a burst pipeline deep in the bush at Viri-Court were killed when two wheelbarrows carrying off the plundered oil collided and provided the spark for the blast, which extended almost a mile along the pipe. Trees as far as five miles away were scorched. </p> <p><b> An organised racket</b><br> </p> <p>The survivors, many of them children with third-degree burns over much of their bodies, can be found in local hospitals. Many others with serious injuries refused to go to hospital, despite the authorities' assurance that they would not be arrested for stealing fuel. </p> <p>A week later 18 died in a similar blast two miles away. A week after that it was 40 near Sapele. In all, more than 2,000 people have been killed in pipeline explosions in the past two years. </p> <p>The oil companies accuse villagers of breaching the pipes, either to steal the fuel or to claim compensation for the resulting pollution. But in one recent explosion it was clear that the pipe was so old that it had fallen apart. </p> <p>There is also evidence of a well-organised racket involving the police, army and employees of the state oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. The NNPC concedes as much by saying that it is not easy to breach a pipeline. </p> <p>\"Our engineers have told us that vandalisation of oil pipelines takes a scientific process which ordinary villagers can't engage in,\" its spokesman, Ndu Ughamadu, said. \"There must be well-placed people that have links with this pipeline vandalisation. Where they have located a pipeline they will perforate holes and quietly they will lay pipeline up to one kilometre where they siphon the fuel at will.\" </p> <p>The oil is pumped into lorries, sometimes guarded by soldiers, and sold on the black market or driven across the border to places where fuel prices are much higher. When the tankers leave, villagers move in at great risk. </p> <p>The NNPC's managing director, Jackson Gaius-Obaseki, said the damage extended far beyond those caught in the explosion. </p> <p>\"The fear and mourning are not only for the dead but for millions of Nigerians living in communities around the vandalised sites, who would be inhaling hydrocarbon vapour and would either suffer lung cancer or begin to die gradually.\" </p> <p>Eleven communities hit by the recent pipeline explosions, including Viri-Court, are seeking \u00a334m in compensation \"We want to let the world know that the fire affected lives and property within a 20-kilometre [12-mile] radius, creating a devastating effect that will last for the next 1,000 years in addition to leaving an everlasting group of widows, widowers and orphans,\" their spokesman said. </p> <p>\"Our communities suffered the environmental degradation of all streams and rivers. Our main sources of drinking water were severely polluted and all flora and fauna destroyed.\" </p> <p>The government has sent paramilitaries to guard the pipelines, but environmental watchdogs accuse them of connivance in the looting, and of killing and raping villagers. The fuel thieves can be just as violent: a month ago a soldier guarding a pipeline near Warri was beheaded by men he tried to stop stealing fuel. </p> <p>The explosions are a blow to the oil companies' attempts to mend relations with the delta communities. With vast new oil finds about to be exploited, they are keen to end the occupations of oil installations and hostage-taking by youths demanding \"compensation\" and jobs. </p> <p>Earlier this month 165 workers, including 20 foreigners, on two Shell drilling rigs were taken hostage. There have been hundreds of similar if smaller cases in recent years. Usually the hostage-takers are paid to go away. </p> <p>But, for the first time, the companies are also facing effective legal challenges. Shell Nigeria, a consortium which includes Elf, Agip and the NNPC, is appealing against a high court award of 4bn naira (\u00a324m) compensation for a 30 year-old oil spill which has still not been cleaned up. </p> <p>It says it has long paid compensation for spills, which is true. But the companies know that the money did not go to clean up pollution or benefit the affected communities, but straight into the pockets of the soldiers and politicians. </p> <p>That suited the army and the companies, which bought their way out of moral and legal responsibility. The companies say times have changed, and so they have. But the people of the delta have yet to be convinced that they will benefit.</p>",

  "<p>There are few people around nowadays who can genuinely enjoy the experience of visiting a car showroom. With British cars branded as the most expensive in Europe, potential buyers are continually worried about being ripped off and are frequently driven away by the hard sell techniques of aggressive sales people. </p> <p>Against this background, it is hardly surprising that increasing numbers of people are turning to the web to help them buy a car. Quick and easier access to cheaper prices, more transparent information and the ability to browse anonymously are the chief reasons why the internet is starting to put pressure on the traditional practices of the UK car industry. </p> <p>Most big car manufacturers and dealers have a presence online but with a few exceptions - including Vauxhall and Peugeot - many of them are not selling cars on the web. Instead they are still opting to channel sales through their physical dealerships. </p> <p>But now that relationship is being challenged. In a move designed to exploit consumer dissatisfaction with the industry's practices, new web-based car retailers are selling cheap cars imported from Europe, and slashing the prices on UK-sourced cars. The new sites can generate savings because they are not saddled with the overheads of large dealer networks. </p> <p>Richard Branson's latest venture, Virgin Cars, imports and sources cars from select UK dealers. The company promises headline-grabbing savings of between 10% and 30% on normal retail prices and, since the end of May, has sold about 1,000 cars online. Cranking up the hype in the usual way, the company is offering test drives, financing and servicing arrangements. There are also plans to promote the service through Virgin's chain of Megastores. </p> <p>Ian Lancaster, the chief executive of Virgin Cars, says, \"Traditional dealers tend to muddy the transactions. </p> <p>\"If you buy a car from us and your neighbour buys the same one, when you're talking in the pub you'll always discover the price is the same.\" </p> <p>He adds that consumers appreciate the fact the business is not tied to one particular car manufacturer. </p> <p>But Virgin faces competition from the likes of Direct Line, which has recently launched a car retail service called Jamjar.com. The company sells imports and has gone into partnership with Dixon Motors to source UK vehicles. It is claiming savings of up to 30%, benefits from Direct Line's established call centre and can also spread word of its new service among Direct Line's millions of motor insurance customers. </p> <p>What is most impressive about the new car websites is their ability to provide tailored information far more effectively and efficiently than a traditional on-the-floor salesperson. When you search online for a car on Jamjar's site you can specify your maximum price, number of seats and size of engine, or select a gimmicky lifestyle option. Then you can choose cars on the basis of how you want to look; swanky and fashionable or more modest and sensible. </p> <p>When you have bought your car, Jamjar emails out a digital photo of the vehicle; and if you are doing a part exchange the company will value your car online based on your appraisal. But be warned: if your description does not match the car accurately when Jamjar collects it, the deal will be off. </p> <p>In a bid to build long-term relationships with its car customers, Jamjar also offers an online shop where you can buy anything from spark plugs and clutches to audio books to keep the kids happy on a long journey. </p> <p>Other high-profile entrants to this emerging online market include Inchcape-owned Autobytel UK and Oneswoop. Autobytel UK was launched in April and, rather than selling cars direct to the customer, supplies information and then refers web-based customers to its accredited \"real world\" dealers. The company says it has sold more than 6,000 vehicles since its launch. </p> <p>So is this how we will all buy our cars in the future? Forrester Research predicts that in the UK the web will be primarily used for browsing and gathering purchasing information, rather than for actual transactions. That means, although the number of online car purchases will be small, the web will be influencing about 500,000 car purchase decisions a year by 2003. That is a market worth about \u00a35.7 billion. </p> <p> In the US, where the car market is governed by different practices, the internet is tipped to have a much bigger direct impact. Jupiter Communications forecasts that online-direct and online- influenced car sales will be worth $128 billion by 2004. </p> <p>Peter McCullough, managing director of Autotrader Interactive, acknowledges that UK consumers still have strong reservations about buying cars online. Cars, he observes, are a different proposition to CDs and books. </p> <p>\"Consumers are confused about what is going on,\" he says. \" They are afraid to buy from dealers and they do not fully understand the online services.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless interest in what the web has to offer is growing. Autotrader, like other car magazines, runs private and dealer ads on its web pages and sees more than three million vehicle searches a month on its site. </p> <p>With more of the car buying population going online, there have been reports of major portals planning to join the race to capture the emerging market. Amazon.co.uk has reportedly approached dealers including Dagenham Motors about the possibility of retailing cars. Meanwhile, earlier this year, the company bought car-related domain names including newcars amazon.com and usedcars amazon.com , although a spokesman for Amazon will only say: \"We are not ruling anything out, but there are no plans at the moment.\" </p> <p>The arrival of new online car retailers has not been without controversy. Some UK manufacturers have accused new car websites of quoting indicative prices rather than firm ones. Many also question whether the internet can genuinely revolutionise car buying and argue that only quality car products will shake up the market. </p> <p>There are also lingering doubts about the ability of a distribution channel like the internet to handle transactions for complex cars. In those cases, industry insiders believe face-to-face consultations are essential. </p> <p>Forrester analyst Caroline Sceats believes websites which depend on imported car sales will not survive in the long run. </p> <p>\"I think the models with the longevity are the models which source cars from dealers or manufacturers. The reason for that is because the opportunity for the import model is based around price disparity and we are seeing the prices of cars in the UK coming down.\" </p> <p>Car manufacturers, used to handing bulk sales, may struggle to adjust to direct one-to-one sales over the web. However, many are beginning to realise that the net presents a unique opportunity to reach out to consumers. </p> <p>In a new move to develop further opportunities to publicise its brand, General Motors, known in this country as Vauxhall, has announced it is investing in a new UK teenage site called Curve.com. </p> <p>And on the fashionable business-to-business front, Daimler-Chrysler, Ford and General Motors have formed a business-to-business market called Covisint <a href=\"http://www.covisint.com\" target=\"_new\">www.covisint.com</a> which could improve the speed of their component supply networks, generate savings, and make them more responsive to customer requests. </p> <p>Legislation is also likely to have a decisive influence on the future shape of the market. In 2002, it is expected that European legislation called the block exemption will be repealed, and this could allow dealers who are currently tied to one manufacturer to sell a greater choice of brands. </p> <p>That means they may promote themselves more aggressively, and raises the possibility of car retailers being able to buy directly from manufacturers. </p> <p>But at the end of the day, the real winners, whether offline or online, are likely to be those car retailers who can successfully cement relationships with their customers which last for the entire lifecycle of a car, from buying right through to all the after sales services. They will be the ones to beat. </p> <p><strong> Cars online</strong> <br>Virgin Cars <a href=\"http://www.virgincars.com\" target=\"_new\">www.virgincars.com</a><br> Jam Jar <a href=\"http://www.jamjar.com\">www.jamjar.com</a><br> One Swoop <a href=\"http://www.oneswoop.co.uk\">www.oneswoop.co.uk</a><br> Auto Trader <a href=\"http://www.autotrader.co.uk\">www.autotrader.co.uk</a><br> What Car <a href=\"http://www.whatcar.co.uk\">www.whatcar.co.uk </a></p>",
  "<p>Voice portals, reputedly the next boom industry in the world of the web, are the technophobe's dream come true. Imagine: you can get up-to-the-minute information from the internet just by picking up your phone anywhere, any time. No more fiddling with a temperamental mouse. No more twiddling your thumbs as your server cranks into gear. You would not even have to know how to use a computer. </p> <p>Several companies have launched voice portals in the US in the past two months, including, BeVocal, Quack, TellMe and Audiopoint, and the trend is due to hit Britain in about a year. They use speech recognition technology to get information from the web and \"speak\" it to you down your phone line. All you do is dial a freephone number and ask for what you want. </p> <p>You cannot just surf the web, but you can find out cinema times, check your stock portfolio or listen to the latest headline news. You can call up travel information before you leave the office, or get driving directions when you are lost. You can choose and book a restaurant table, and hear film or book reviews, or your horoscope. All straight off the web. All without touching a computer. </p> <p>Experts are predicting massive growth: the Kelsey Group, a market analyst firm, estimates that in five years, 18 million consumers will be using some kind of speech recognition portal. </p> <p>Voice portals have been possible because of advances in two crucial technologies: speech recognition software (from companies such as Lucent, Nuance and Speechworks) can now understand natural speech in a wide range of accents and diction without having to be trained to a specific voice. And new standards such as VoiceXML are beginning to make it as easy to write voice services as HTML did to write web pages. </p> <p>With VoiceXML, your voice takes the place of a mouse and your spoken command is like a click. You cannot call up conventional web pages, but you can access information that has been specially composed for the phone: sound clips, music or text spoken by the computer (in a Stephen Hawking voice). </p> <p>The bad news is that the big bucks will come from advertising. The Kelsey Group predicts that advertising revenues on voice portals will reach $17 billion in 2005. So does this mean that when you ring to check whether there's a traffic jam on your route home, you will have to endure 10 minutes of Pamper's ads? I am based in the US, so decided to get a taste of what Britain will be in for. </p> <p>I started with Tellme, the most hyped 'V-commerce' firm and reputedly the best. Using the service is so simple, even the most tech-terrified could do it. Instructions - in a real human voice, rather than anything scary and automated - are clear and repeated often frequently. It understood my British accent without a glitch and in less than two minutes I had narrowed my restaurant search to 10 Vietnamese eateries in the area I wanted. I heard a couple of reviews, with gradings for service, decor and food, and when I had picked one, Tellme connected me directly to it, so I could book there and then. The ads were unobtrusive (though this could change as the service expands) and it only asked me, grovelling apologetically, to repeat myself once. </p> <p>Others - I tried four more - were also generally easy, though, as you would expect during a roll-out period, the information available varied. Audiopoint, which allows you to customise its service, gave quick, and surprisingly comprehensive, information on current travel problems in my area. BeVocal was the exception: after it had asked me four times at the start for my phone number (\"I did not understand you\"), I hung up in irritation. </p> <p>Simplicity is, in fact, the selling point of voice portals, perhaps because people have less patience on the phone than at their terminals: \"I wanted to build something that my mom would use,\" says Michael McCue, Tellme's chief executive. The everyday consumer who is fed up with technology angst and the complexity that has come about from the rise of the internet can still use the net.\" </p> <p>With 1.7 billion telephones in the world, McCue's potential market is certainly capacious. This is why most companies are trying to give themselves a particular spin: Tellme's speciality is dining suggestions. With TelSurf you can read and send email over the phone. And BeVocal claims to be the last word in road directions. </p> <p>But it is not clear whether the technology will work as well with millions of users as it does with a few thousand. Also, it won't be free if you're on a mobile phone - probably when you will need a voice portal the most. It is no wonder that British mobile operators like Orange, Vodafone and One2One are rumoured to be developing voice portals of their own. </p> <p>But the race for British custom is on. Tellme expects to launch in Britain by the end of 2001 and Audiopoint, which launched in the US last week, is \"talking to people in Europe\". So next time you're grappling with the yellow pages, watching your PC crash, take comfort: voice portals are on their way.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Pole vault champion trips up </strong></p> <p><strong>Sergei Bubka's Millennium Games </strong> <br> PC CD-Rom \u00a324.99 Dinamic/Midas ** Interactive <br> The box lid of Millennium Games lists Sergei Bubka's selling points: \"Unrivalled world champion. An amazing career that spans two decades. Six-time consecutive Pole Vaulting World Champion. Holder of 35 World Records (17 outdoor, 18 indoor).\" Just in case the message hasn't quite got through, the instructions begin with a section eulogising the althlete's (admittedly impressive) achievements all over again. By now, I'm convinced I want to buy Sergei Bubka. But what about his game? </p> <p>Actually, \"his\" game is overstating the case. Apart from the deification in the literature and a mugshot on the menu, the Ukrainian high flyer does not feature at all. </p> <p>True, the pole vault is one of the 19 events in this athletics sim (albeit one for which there is no tutorial). The other 18 are standard track-and-field stuff: hurdles, throws, jumps, sprints and long-distance running. </p> <p>Where this differs from its competitors is its MDP (mouse-driven power) system. This involves a rotating ring below the athlete with a fixed marker on its inner circumference. The object is to keep to the mouse button depressed while the green section of the disc passes beneath the marker, and to release it when it gets to red. This seems simple enough, and makes a half-decent stab at modelling athletic action. </p> <p>In practice, though, it is a strain to have to focus on a spinning disc, especially in the longer events. And when you are concentrating on a space just below the athlete's feet, you tend to miss out on other things - like where the no-throw line is, or what your athlete looks like. Fortunately for those with fewer than six eyes, a button-bashing mode is also available. </p> <p>On the subject of looks, the graphics are smooth enough, but far from detailed, and with a slightly washed-out feel. The crowd sounds, meanwhile, seem to have been lifted from a cockfight instead of an athletics stadium. </p> <p>If the events themselves are less than thrilling, the campaign modes are a fun addition. You can, if you choose, attempt to train an entire national team, with the aim of bringing home as many medals as possible. </p> <p>The more rewarding option is the decathlete trainer mode, in which you guide a young sports star through training, injuries and successively bigger competitions towards the ultimate goal of Olympic gold. </p> <p>Enjoyable as this is, it still entails mastering the individual events. Which, given the annoyingly vague tutorials and the blink-and-you'll-muff-it control system, is a tall order. If you do ever win a medal, you deserve one. (AB)</p> <p> <strong> Shameless cash-in lacks punch</strong></p> <p><strong> X-Men</strong> <br>Sony PlayStation \u00a329.99 Activision ** <br> Back in the good old days, when games came on tapes and keyboards dressed in rubber, all manner of movie licences were hastily ported on to the dominant genres of the day. </p> <p>Robocop was a side scrolling platform game, while Indiana Jones offered similar thrills. Batman? Well, rest assured, there were plenty of ledges to reach. </p> <p>In short, movie licences quickly became known as a shortcut to an unimaginative, lazy and pointless game. </p> <p>Unfortunately, in the 21st century things have got little better. With the exception of Goldeneye, film-licensed games are still struggling to reach mediocrity. Remember Phantom Menace? </p> <p>However, the just released X-Men movie, with its freakish set of characters, seemed to offer the basis for a cracking game. So, what do we get? Certainly not a stylish adventure epic. </p> <p>X-Men is, in fact, a fighting game - and a bog standard one at that. Graphics? Fine. Sound? Adequate. Originality? Snore, er pardon? </p> <p>X-Men shamelessly filches Street Fighter's feel and ridiculous special moves before adding some Tekken character design. </p> <p>And, if you have always suspected that beat-'em-up games are hollow exercises in button-bashing, then look here for confirmation. Extensive blindfold testing has revealed that random finger gymnastics are often as successful as a more studied approach. </p> <p>Anyhow, with rewards including movie clips and comic photos, you would have to be a real fan to want to practise this one. </p> <p>Despite the inclusion of 10 X-Men characters, comically pummelling each other in front of some authentic movie backdrops, this is uninspiring fare. Shamelessly derivative, and with a pungent whiff of cash-in, X-Men is yet another film-licensed disappointment. (GH)</p> <p><strong> Wham, BAM - the bubble bursts</strong></p> <p><strong> Bust-A-Move 4</strong><br> Sega Dreamcast \u00a324.99 Taito/Acclaim ***<br> Bust-A-Move is a classic puzzle game that stands comparison with Tetris and Columns, and while it's not as compulsive as those in single-player mode, it is a much better multi-player game. Bust-A-Move's forte is head-to-head battles, either player v computer or player v player. </p> <p>But like the later, fancier versions of Tetris, Bust-A-Move 4 has lost much of the simplicity that was one of its attractions. Adding more puzzles, and bubbles with different behaviours, has made it a bit more challenging and a lot more confusing. </p> <p>In the graphics department more turns out to be less. This is one of the few games that does not seem to benefit from the Dreamcast's superior graphics and sound. In fact, BAM4 takes the saccharine Japanese graphics style to a peak of excess. It is so cute it makes Super Mario Brothers look like gritty realism. </p> <p>The aim of the game is the same. You shoot coloured bubbles at a descending network of existing coloured bubbles, and they stick together. When three or more bubbles of the same colour are stuck to one another, they burst, and fall down the screen. But not only can you remove three or more bubbles this way, you can also remove any bubbles that depended on them for support. This is the tricky bit, and the way to score huge bonuses, in what is always a race against time. </p> <p>BAM4 is a very playable game, and a welcome addition to the Dreamcast line-up, especially at the price. But the original PlayStation version was simpler and just as satisfying. (JS)</p>",
  "<p><strong> Show offs</strong><br> Nintendo will unveil the Game Boy Advance handheld console today at a special conference before the opening of its Spaceworld exhibition in Tokyo, Japan. See <a href=\"http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/sw2000\">www.nintendo.co.jp/n10/sw2000</a>. It will not be shown in the UK until September 2, just before the <a href=\"http://www.ects.com\">European Computer Trade Show</a> in London, when retailers may learn when Nintendo will have shipments to sell, and at what price. Nintendo is expected to show its next-generation Dolphin games console at the same events, but says it won't be showing any playable games. </p> <p><strong> Brain box</strong><br> Nasa has developed a technology that it claims will enable video gamers to enjoy better health. Nasa researchers say that, using biofeedback, people can be trained to change their brainwave activity or other physiological functions while playing popular off-the-shelf video games. </p> <p>The system involves attaching sensors to the player's head and body and feeding the output through a signal-processing unit to a joystick or other controller. </p> <p>\"As the player's brainwaves come closer to an optimal, stress-free pattern, the joystick becomes easier to control. This encourages the player to produce these patterns or signals to succeed at the game.\" </p> <p>The idea was developed using flight simulators and has been tested at the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS) in Norfolk. Nasa says, \"several companies have applied for a licence to produce training systems for the general public.\" </p> <p><strong> Bear faced</strong><br> Greenpeace is using a game to promote the health of the planet. Arctic Action, on the web at <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk\">www.greenpeace.org.uk</a>, pits snowball-throwing polar bears against advancing BP oil rigs. The game is free but requires Macromedia Shockwave 7. </p> <p><strong> Quake eight</strong><br> England beat an unlucky Scotland to make it into the last eight in the Quake III European Championship, and the finals will be held this weekend at The Playing Fields games cafe in central London.

  "<p><strong> What does OpenTV do? </strong> OpenTV is the worldwide leader in interactive television, introducing viewers to a new TV experience through their remote control. </p> <p><strong> Why do you think viewers want to interact with their TV? Isn't one of the attractions of the TV that it is a passive experience? </strong> TV is all about leisure, information, ease of use, impulse reaction and emotion. Interactivity builds on this by giving people the opportunity to respond to the programmes they watch, get information when they want it or buy products when they see them. </p> <p><strong> We hear a lot about convergence - where various entertainment and computer functions are going to come together in a single box. So is the TV turning into a personal computer, or is it the other way around? </strong> TV is for entertainment, whereas the PC is focused on work and processing, so your expectations and use of the TV and PC are different. You may see email on interactive TV but you won't see an Excel spreadsheet. Interactive TV needs to be easier to use, graphics rich and more reliable - people don't want to have to re-boot their televisions! Also, the TV is a true mass market product, so it needs to be kept at a low price. </p> <p><strong> OpenTV operates across the world - what differences are there between countries, other than language, which you have to take account of? </strong> There are major differences in viewing habits and the level of complexity that TV viewers want. We have to make sure that our applications can be customised. Nonetheless they will work in all environments, whether they are delivered by satellite, cable or terrestrial networks. </p> <p><strong> Are you trying to sell interactive TV as a replacement for the web and internet, or as a supplement? </strong> These are two co-existing marketplaces. Many people will have internet access and interactive TV but will use them for different things. Interactive TV will also reach people who don't have computers. This is why many companies are looking to have a presence on interactive TV and the internet, adapting the range of products they sell, services and information accordingly. </p> <p><strong> How do you use technology in your work? </strong> At work I use computers, email, the internet and my mobile phone to make sure I am available no matter where I am. At home I use interactive TV to do things like checking my bank account and getting a weather forecast. </p> <p><strong> What are your favourite websites? </strong> My internet browser is defaulted to <a href=\"http://www.afp.com\">AFP - Agence France Presse news agency</a>, which keeps me up to date with business news. I'm also a fan of <a href=\"http://www.ft.com\">ft.com</a> and the Paris transportation authority's pages at <a href=\"http://www.ratp.fr\">www.ratp.fr</a>. </p> <p>\u0095 OpenTV's website is at <a href=\"http://www.opentv.com\">www.opentv.com</a> </p>"
