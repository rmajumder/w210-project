  "<p>The battle of the fallen giants ended with Blackburn reprising their role of top dogs to move into the top half of the First Division last night. Two first-half goals and a compact, organised performance from the former Premiership champions were rightly rewarded with victory over a Wimbledon side also finding it hard to recapture former glories. </p> <p>The reduction in Blackburn's circumstances is particularly noticeable on European weeks such as these. Five years ago they were in the Champions League where their surroundings were a lot more glamourous than this wet evening here in front of an echoing crowd of just over 6,000. </p> <p>But having run Fulham close on Sunday, the signs were already there that Graeme Souness may be finally getting it together at Blackburn. After a cautious opening 20 minutes, in which each side could only muster one shot at the keeper, Rovers took the lead in embarrassing circumstances. </p> <p>Stig Bjornebye, about 20 yards out on the right, curled in a free-kick and as Rovers' Craig Short went for the ball, Wimbledon's Trond Andersen tried to intervene but only managed to divert the ball into his own net. </p> <p>Rovers had taken the lead at Fulham before surrendering it. And Wimbledon almost hit back when a great move involving Chris Willmott and John Hartson ended with the Rovers keeper John Filan's instinctive one-handed save to deny Jonathan Hunt. </p> <p>But then Blackburn took control. Kelvin Davis saved from Garry Flitcroft before Rovers extended their lead. Just before half-time a Wimbledon clearance fell to Flitcroft about 25 yards out and the Rovers captain unleashed a stunning first-time volley into the back of the net. </p> <p>Blackburn were clearly not missing their two injured strikers Matt Jansen and Nathan Blake. Wimbledon, meanwhile, were missing a lot. In an attempt to fill a few gaps, they made a double substitution at half-time, bringing on the veteran midfielder Michael Thomas and the rangy young striker Patrick Agyemang. </p> <p>But the Wimbledon gang do not seem so crazy after all these years, unless one counts last Saturday's 4-4 home draw with Gillingham. The old spirit was lacking and Blackburn continued to pose the greater threat as Craig Hignett fired from close range straight at Davis then wriggled his way into the area to force a fine one-handed save from the keeper. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Independent financial advisers and their insurers are seeking a judicial review of the High Court's ruling that windfall shares should not be included in any compensation payouts to clients who were mis-sold endowments and pensions.</p> <p>If they succeed, policyholders who may have received and spent windfall shares from their building society's demutualisation will have to discount the value of the shares from the shortfall in their endowment or pension policy.</p> <p>Gareth Fatchett, partner at law firm Armstrong Neal which has been approached to take the case, says the issue is one of fairness. \"Any financial product comes with assets and liabilities,\" he said. \"In this case, the products' liabilities were that they might not perform. But their assets where that they led to windfall shares. It's is not right that policyholders who were more than happy to take the windfall shares are complaining that the policies which gave them the shares are under-performing.\"</p> <p>It is understood the case is being driven by IFAs who may go out of business if they have to pay compensation and their professional indemnity insurers who will have to fork out for any claims. </p> <p>If the compensation process results in big payouts, professional indemnity insurers say premiums will have to increase to cover the cost which, in turn, may make insurance too expensive and put IFAs out of business. As such, a judicial review would try to prevent a vicious circle leading to IFAs being bankrupted. </p> <p>Any ruling in favour of the IFAs would be very controversial; building society members who didn't have endowments or pensions will be able to keep their windfall shares whilst those with shortfall policies will face a double whammy of under-performing pensions and endowments and missing out on bonus shares.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers pushing the case for radical reform of town and county halls think their campaign to create a network of elected executive mayors in England after the next general election is finally paying off. With some 14 councils, led by Birmingham, preparing to hold mayoral referendums - and a string of others poised to join them - all the signs now point to a \"national democracy day\" in 12 months' time. </p> <p>The idea is to co-ordinate up to 30 mayoral referendums next October to test popular support for an elected first citizen - with full-blown mayoral polls coinciding with local elections in May 2002. </p> <p>This comes as key members of the New Local Government Network, a pressure group close to Downing Street, publish the results of a lengthy research project which urges the government to be far bolder in giving councils more powers and responsibilities - and argues that policies imposed from the top without local support often fail. Significantly some of the findings of the project, Towards a New Localism, which will be discussed at a conference in London tomorrow, follow the Guardian's own agenda for local democracy, published last month in its alternative election manifesto. </p> <p>The network says that the mayoral debate should light the spark for a much wider reform process, with councils developing into the champions of their areas by assuming a wider leadership role embracing the economic and social health of communities. It attacks the excessive centralism of Whitehall and calls for a new system of five-year \"partnership compacts\", drawn up between town halls and all local stakeholders, which would replace the panoply of government-inspired programmes. Councils selected for such compacts would get extra government cash and support. </p> <p>With the network influential in parts of the government, the reaction of ministers so far has been interesting. Perhaps with an eye on the project, local government minister, Hilary Armstrong, has urged authorities to become more adventurous. \"Councils don't need to wait for a lead from central government before testing new ideas,\" she last week told the annual conference of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives. \"I'd be very pleased to see more evidence of councils making the running with their own reform agenda.\" </p> <p>Armstrong finally pushed through legislation paving the way for mayors and cabinet-style administrations three months ago, with her boss at the environment department, John Prescott, publicly expressing opposition to the concept. </p> <p>Nevertheless, with Birmingham now on track to lead the field, it is likely that other big cities will join small authorities - such as Berwick-upon-Tweed, and several London boroughs - in quickening the pace for change. Birmingham's support rested on a knife edge. But the council's Labour leader, Albert Bore and his deputy, Andy Howell, have narrowly retained their positions after beating off opposition in the city's divided Labour group.</p>",
  "<p>Posters are springing up on billboards across the country this week, asking business people: \"What have you got to offer?\" The posters variously feature a pub, a restaurant and a greengrocer's, but the aim is to put the onus on all service providers to think about how they cater for customers with disabilities. </p> <p>The poster campaign, which will be matched by newspaper and magazine advertisements, has been devised by the Department for Education and Employment to raise awareness of provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) that service providers should make \"reasonable\" adjustments to ensure disabled people have appropriate access. The provisions became effective a year ago. </p> <p>The campaign is the first by the government on disability since last year's See the Person drive, which faced criticism from some disability activists for being patronising. It is believed that the composition of the new posters was discussed in advance, and at length, with a number of people from the disability sector. </p> <p>A key theme of the campaign is that businesses very often need make only small changes to comply with the act. Many business people have been alarmed by rumours, and reports in parts of the media, that fundamental changes are required. The posters give a helpline number and a website address where further advice is available from the Disability Rights Commission (DRC). </p> <p>Margaret Hodge, minister for disabled people, says: \"There are over 8m disabled people in the UK with a spending power of over \u00a340bn a year. And those disabled people want to use services just like everyone else. </p> <p>\"This campaign will help service providers understand practical and simple ways in which they can make their businesses more accessible to disabled customers. These easy-to-understand examples on the posters will help businesses think again about what they can do to help increase their access to disabled people.\" </p> <p>Early reaction among mainstream disability groups has been favourable. They are welcoming the shift of emphasis from the pure consciousness raising of See the Person to the need for concrete measures to help disabled people. </p> <p>Brian Lamb, public affairs director of the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, says: \"It's a good attempt to show that a lot of the adjustments that businesses are expected to make are simple and easily do-able, so that disabled people can have the same level of service as everyone else. </p> <p>\"All the evidence shows that it's small and medium sized businesses that are either completely unaware of the legislation, or are not getting to grips with it. The B&amp;Qs of this world are well aware of it already, and are making enormous strides, but a lot of everyday services don't come from them - they come from the guy round the corner.\" </p> <p>Liz Daone, head of campaigns at Scope, the cerebral palsy charity which has itself mounted similar awareness drives, says she is \"delighted that Margaret Hodge is recognising the importance of the disabled pound\". </p> <p>It makes no sense for businesses to exclude disabled people, says Daone. \"Companies that do not become accessible will miss out on these customers - and on profits - and are potentially in breach of the DDA. The poster campaign shows that accessibility changes do not have to cost a lot. </p> <p>\"Businesses often complain that they cannot afford to make their premises accessible, or do not know where to go for help. Surely, with the launch of this campaign, businesses can no longer use ignorance as an excuse.\" </p> <p>Disability groups will be looking to the government to build on the campaign. Lamb says: \"Of course it's not enough on its own. What's needed is the determination to see it through. It does need to be sustained.\" </p> <p> \u0095 The DRC helpline is on 08457-622633 and its website is at <a href=\"http://www.drc-gb.org\">www.drc-gb.org</a></p>",
  "The chief executive of Railtrack, Gerald Corbett, tendered his resignation today, as the organisation admitted that the condition of the track in the area of yesterday's Hatfield train derailment was \"not good\". <p>With investigations into the crash focusing on the possibility that a broken rail caused the Great North Eastern Railways service to derail, the Railtrack board will meet at 6pm today to decide whether to accept Mr Corbett's resignation.</p> <p>Railtrack, the rail infrastructure company that is responsible for maintaining tracks, said the section of the line where the accident occurred had been reassessed for re-railing in January and that work had started in May. </p> <p>The balance of the work was due to have been completed in November and the crash section of track had been treated for grinding in early September to prevent cracks, Railtrack said. </p> <p>As GNER resumed a full service on the line where four people died yesterday, Railtrack said that it was \"investigating the possibility of a broken rail being a factor in the tragedy\".</p> <p>At the scene of the crash, a Railtrack director said that a broken rail had been found, but it was not yet known if it was smashed before the accident or during it.</p> <p>Earlier, Mr Corbett said: \"I, personally, am distraught that another tragedy has occurred on our railways. </p> <p>\"The families of the bereaved are foremost in my mind. As a matter of course, as chief executive of Railtrack, I have, of course, tendered my resignation to the board.\"</p> <p>However, Pam Warren, the founder of the Paddington Survivors Group, said: \"We urge Railtrack not to accept Gerald Corbett's resignation.\" </p> <p>Speaking at a news conference at the Madejski stadium in Reading, Berks, Mrs Warren, who was badly burned in last year's rail disaster, said: \"I have today spoken to Gerald Corbett and his wife. He is genuinely upset and affected with what has happened. </p> <p>\"The way forward now is constructive dialogue. We are beginning to have a working relationship with Railtrack.\" </p> <p>Railtrack also today imposed a speed restriction on bends on high-speed lines. This will require drivers to knock a third off their permitted speed in such areas and will lead to inevitable delays for passengers.</p> <p>Seven people were today still in hospital after Tuesday's 12.10pm GNER London to Leeds high-speed train derailed in Hertfordshire.</p> <p>The four men who died in the crash have yet to be named, although the identities of two of those who died in the crash were due to be released later tonight by police. All were in the buffet car of the train which had its roof torn off after colliding with a trackside pylon.</p> <p>Although they were not named, those still in hospital are six women and one man. The women were identified as a 61-year-old from Salisbury in Wiltshire, a 30-year-old from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, a 66-year-old from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, a 40-year-old from Nottingham, a 38-year-old from London and a 40-year old from Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The man, aged 41, comes from south-east London, said police. </p> <p>Both Railtrack and GNER agreed today that the crash will lead to renewed anxiety among passengers.</p> <p>Railtrack London and North East Region director Nicholas Pollard said: \"The investigations will continue urgently throughout today.\"</p> <p>He said he was aware that Railtrack could come under heavy fire if the crash was found to be caused by a fault with a rail.</p> <p>\"I am sure people will take that line and I understand that obviously a tragedy of this nature shakes confidence right across the industry in the UK as a whole.\"</p> <p>GNER chief executive Christopher Garnett said that railways were still \"incredibly safe although I do accept that what happened yesterday has shaken people's confidence\".</p> <p>Mr Garnett added that he did not think that the number of serious accidents in recent years was anything to do with rail privatisation.</p> <p>He added: \"There is a perception that rail travel is unsafe, but when you look at the statistics, it is an incredibly safe way of travel.\"</p> <p>But Vernon Hince, of the biggest rail union the RMT, said there had been widespread concern that the privatised rail companies were not observing safety procedures.</p> <p>George Muir, director general of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said that he was certain that \"corners were not cut\".</p> <p>As the search for clues continued, transport minister Lord Macdonald said that he was looking for answers \"in hours and days rather than weeks\".</p> <p>The routes that are most likely to be affected by the Railtrack speed restrictions are the London to Scotland East Coast main line on which the accident happened, the West Coast main line, which also runs from London to Scotland and the Great Western line from London to Bristol and Cardiff.</p> <p>The West Coast line, in particular, has a number of bends.</p> <p>This has prompted Virgin Trains, run by Sir Richard Branson, to invest in high-speed tilting trains that can go faster around curves.</p> <p>They are due to be introduced on the line in 2002 and will considerably reduce journey times from London to the Midlands, north west of England and Scotland. </p> <p>After bringing down the annual number of broken rails in the network, Railtrack had to report a sharp rise in incidents in 1998-99. Although the figure was slightly down in 1999-2000, Rail Regulator Tom Winsor has told Railtrack of his unhappiness with its record on broken rails.</p> <p>Publishing the latest statistics for broken rail, the Health and Safety Executive said that the number was \"still significantly higher than in the mid-1990s\".</p> <p>Another problem, according to provisional HSE figures, is buckles in track. The number of these, which had fallen to 21 in 1998-99, more than trebled to 64 in 1999-2000.</p> <p>Yesterday's accident occurred on a stretch of track that is continuously welded, which should greatly reduce the chances of a rail cracking. But rail experts agree that defects can appear even in welded areas.</p> <p>In its most recent annual report, Railtrack said that the drop in the number of broken rails last year was not enough, but added that track quality was now better than at any time since the mid-1990s.</p> <p>The company has also said that the growth of traffic on the network, particularly heavy freight, has had a major impact on track deterioration.</p> <p>The company has been ensuring that track renewals are targeted at locations where they will have the most effect.</p> <p>Railtrack has also spoken of introducing the UIC60 rail, which is the standard rail used in the rest of Europe. It is stronger than the traditional rail that is used in Britain and needs less maintenance.</p> <p>The company plans to replace an extra 350 miles of rail over the next five years. A total of 68,000 tonnes of new rail has been ordered for this year - the highest amount since 1988.</p> <p>In 1995-96, there were 776 broken rails and 133 track buckles on the network. The following year, broken rails dropped to 739, but provisional figures for 1999-2000 saw the figure climb to 949 from a high of 988 in the previous 12 months.</p> <p>Track buckles slid to a low of 21 in 1998-99, but by last year, the provisional figures revealed 64 incidents.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the crash, several possible reasons for the crash were considered, including terrorism, which has since been discounted.</p> <p>A broken wheel was also thought a possible cause, but GNER said today that, as they were convinced that this was not the case, they would be running a service on the route today.</p> <p>Vandalism is another possibility that has not been ruled out, but that seems unlikely, as it would be expected that the front of the train would have been derailed before the middle carriages.</p> <p>The assistant chief constable of the British Transport Police, Paul Nicholas, said that a criminal investigation, probing the possibility of vandalism, was underway. This needs to be concluded before the police give control of the scene over for the technical investigation _ which is expected to happen no earlier than the end of this week. </p> <p>Mr Nicholas said: \"20% of that [the investigation] has been conducted and there is no evidence of vandalism so far.\" </p> <p>The overturned carriages had been partially lifted this afternoon with the use of air bags and no more casualties had been found, he said. The search would continue tomorrow and the carriages would probably not be removed from the line until Friday.</p> <p> Among the Railtrack board members who will tonight decide the fate of Mr Gerald Corbett's will be Jennifer Page, the sacked chief executive of the Millennium Dome.</p> <p>Ms Page, who earns \u00a326,000 in her role as a part-time board member of Railtrack, will be one of 12 directors at the meeting, which will start after 6pm at Railtrack's head office by Euston station in London.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.railtrack.co.uk/search/BuildResults.cfm?u=http://www.railtrack.co.uk/shareholder/agm99/directors/2.html\">Gerald Corbett's CV</a></p>",

  "<b>Southall, Clapham, Ladbroke Grove and now Hatfield. Why are there so many train accidents?</b> <br> Yesterday's derailment near Hatfield, Hertforshire, was the latest in a series of fatal rail accidents stretching back over 12 years. Unlike the previous three, however, the London to Leeds intercity did not collide with another train but simply came off the rails. Until the investigation is complete we will not know why. <p><b>Who carries out the investigation?</b><br> The government's health and safety executive will examine the wreckage with the railways inspectorate and around 60 to 70 officers from the British Transport Police. The investigators are all specialists and this time last year many would have been working at Ladbroke Grove. They will be looking for anything out of the ordinary that would cause the intercity to derail. Lord Macdonald, the transport minister, has said he wants answers quickly.</p> <p><b>What are the likely causes?</b><br> Vandalism and terrorism have been ruled out so the investigators will be looking for faults on the track or train. Preliminary investigations have revealed that a rail was smashed and, if it was damaged before the accident, that would have been enough to derail the train. But until forensic tests are complete we will not know when the track was smashed. If it was damaged during the accident, the investigators will then look for faults on the rolling stock's wheels and axles. </p> <p><b>Are the railways safe?</b><br> Thirty-five people died at Clapham, seven at Southall and 31 at Ladbroke Grove. Four died at Hatfield and, in total, 94 people have died on the railways since 1988 in accidents including those already mentioned and others at places such as Purley, Glasgow and Stafford. </p> <p><b>What do the train operators say?</b><br> Christopher Garnett, the GNER chief executive, says the railways are safe: \"There is a perception that rail travel is unsafe, but when you look at the statistics it is an incredibly safe way of travel,\" he said today. Train travel may be statistically safer than making a journey by car but that does not mean it is safe, or as safe as it could be. The Southall inquiry recommended automatic train protection (ATP) for the rail network to stops trains passing red signals at danger and crashing into each other. The Ladbroke Grove inquiry is not complete but many believe that accident, which happened on the same stretch of track, would have been avoided if ATP had been installed, as it is in much of the European Union.</p> <p><b>Will it be installed?</b><br> Successive governments and the rail industry have dragged their heels for so long that the ATP equipment they were expected to fit a decade ago is now out of date. Railtrack is now pressing ahead with a project to install the non-computerised, and inferior, train protection warning system (TPWS) but, on the other hand, plans to fit the superior European train control system (ETCS) on the west coast line between London, the Midlands and Glasgow by 2005. However, with no firm plans beyond that date it is likely to be at least a decade before Britain has a decent high speed rail network with automatic safety systems. <b>Is it fair to say the privatised rail companies are more interested in profit than safety?</b><br> The rail companies say that the number of accidents in recent years has nothing to do with privatisation. Some disagree: Vernon Hince, of the RMT rail union, said today that there is widespread concern that the privatised operators are not observing safety procedures. Whatever the answer, the last government cut the money given to British Rail as it prepared it for privatisation (to make it attractive for investors, for which read cheap.) If the recent accidents are due to a lack of investment, it goes back a lot further than the four years that Railtrack and the private operators have been in control.</p> <p><b>Is the network in a bad state?</b><br> There were 949 broken rails last year, up from 656 in 1995. In August the rail regulator, Tom Winsor, said he was unhappy with Railtrack's failure to make \"an appreciable reduction\" in the number of broken rails. Railtrack makes \u00a31.3m profit a day looking after the 20,000 miles of lines, signals and stations that make up its network. <b>What steps is Railtrack taking?</b><br> The speed limits of trains across the country have been cut until the cause of yesterday's disaster is clear. This does not mean that train was going too fast - it is a precaution to take the stress of what may be faulty rails or rolling stock. A train that normally travels at 100 mph will now be restricted to 65 mph.</p> <p><b>What if it is Railtrack's fault?</b><br> Gerald Corbett, the company's chief executive, has tendered his resignation and Railtrack's board meets tonight to decide whether to accept it. He bore the brunt of much of the criticism in the wake of the Paddington disaster and today expressed regret for Hatfield. \"I, personally, am distraught that another tragedy has occurred on our railways,\" he said. If Railtrack were found responsible it would have enormous repercussions for the company and the future of rail travel in the UK. </p> <p><b>Could the rail companies be charged with corporate manslaughter?</b><br> The current law states that charges of corporate manslaughter can be brought against named individuals in companies only if the prosecution can prove they have \"controlling\" responsibility. That has led to executives escaping charges in a string of high-profile disasters ranging from the King's Cross tube station fire that killed 31 people in 1987 to last year's Paddington rail crash.

  "<p>She was the most famous nurse of her era. She was years ahead of her time in her views on patient-focused care, nurse training and nursing management. Yet today she is little known. Is it because she developed Alzheimer's? </p> <p>According to a new biography, the outstanding contribution of Dame Muriel Powell has not been adequately recognised because of the embarrassment of her last years in the profession, when she was increasingly unwell. Far from facing up to her predicament, the worlds of health and government - in which she moved at the most senior levels - sought to deny it or cover it up. </p> <p>This was less than 30 years ago. And that the true story can emerge only now is testimony to how recently we have come to understand and accept the reality of Alzheimer's and of dementia in general. </p> <p>Powell was matron and later chief nursing officer at St George's hospital, then in central London, for an astonishing 22 years. For six years after that, until her retirement, she was Scotland's chief nurse. But the contrast between those two stages of her career could scarcely have been more stark. </p> <p>At St George's, in the words of biographer Elizabeth Scott, she rose to become \"the undisputed leader of her profession\". She knew how to use the media and was regularly in the press and on radio and television. Such was her profile that she was chosen to appear in the first television campaign against drink-driving. </p> <p>Within the hospital, where she was appointed matron in 1947 at the age of 32, she pioneered a brand of nursing that brought the profession into the modern age. While by no means revolutionary - she told students: \"A good nurse is someone who reads the Times editorial every day\" - she was convinced of the need to humanise the hospital environment. </p> <p>Until the 60s, it was unquestioned practice in hospitals to wake patients any time after 4.30am, but certainly by 6am, in order for the night nurses to bathe them and make their beds. Powell instructed that no patient be woken before 7am and would watch from her flat to check that no lights appeared on the wards until that time - even though it put a great strain on the nurses to get everything done before doctors started their ward rounds at 9am. </p> <p>Powell was lively, confident and assertive. When she moved to Scotland, however, she appeared subdued, forgetful and increasingly prone to flashes of anger. In top level meetings, she failed to shine. \"From having been an enthusiastic participant in all professional discussions, she became a shadowy, quiet presence who contributed little,\" says Scott. By 1974, four years after moving north, she was so distracted that elaborate arrangements were made to look after her when she attended meetings outside the Scottish Office. Yet nobody grasped the nettle. At one meeting in London, a medical officer accompanying her is said to have remarked in conversation: \"Sadly, Dame Muriel is away with the fairies these days.\" </p> <p>Powell's contract was even extended for two years beyond age 60. When she retired in 1976, says Scott, she left \"under a pall of numbness and near silence\". </p> <p>Today, it seems extraordinary that such a decline was not acted upon by colleagues at the Scottish Office. But the biograpy, Muriel Powell Remembered, concludes: \"Here was an eminent nurse who had a national and international status and reputation. She was, for want of a better word, their boss who appeared to be developing a mental illness. To have raised questions ... could have been seen as criticism.\" </p> <p>Powell died in 1978, aged 64, in a psychiatric hospital in Gloucestershire, where she had retired. Some 800 people, including government ministers, attended a memorial service in London. A year later, an article in the Observer newspaper on \"the sad, quiet epidemic\", led to the setting up of what is now the Alzheimer's Society. </p> <p>Harry Cayton, the society's chief executive, says greater awareness of the condition makes it unlikely that any comparable figure would today be treated the same way. But he fears the pendulum may have swung to the other extreme, with growing evidence of people with Alzheimer's being summarily sacked from their jobs. </p> <p>\"We recently had to fight for compensation to restore pension rights for somebody who had been dismissed as incompetent or neglectful. It later turned out to be Alzheimer's,\" says Cayton. \"It's not uncommon to find that people who are getting Alzheimer's in their 50s and 60s are being treated quite badly.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Muriel Powell Remembered is available at \u00a312.50, plus \u00a31.20 p&amp;p, from the St George's Nurses League, c/o Chief Nurse's Office, Room 32, 1st Floor, Grosvenor Wing, St George's Hospital, London SW17 0QT</p>",
  "<p>They came with turquoise and yellow macaw-feather headdresses, carved javelins, bows and arrows, teeth and beads, and faces painted with achote \"war\" paint. Seventy people in three canoes - elders, shamans, leaders, archers and Amazonian women. They came to seek justice armed with a few of modernity's arrows: a copy of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention No. 169 on indigenous and tribal rights, the title deeds to their land and two documentary film-makers. </p> <p>The destination was an illegal goldmine, two hours upriver by motorised canoe from Tres Islas in Madre de Dios, Peru. The Shipibo, one of the indigenous peoples of Peru, own this land and, supported by other indigenous groups, they are on the warpath. </p> <p>Gold miners have taken over an area amounting to between a half and a third of their land. Though they have \"legal\" concessions, they have not, as required, obtained permission from the Shipibo. In law the concessions are invalid. The Shipibo want the miners out. The miners don't look set to leave. The authorities move firmly between inaction and inertia. So the Shipibo have taken to their canoes. </p> <p>Indigenous peoples of Madre de Dios have long suffered at the hands of rubber barons, Catholic and Evangelical god-barons, \"eco-tourism\" barons and gold barons. Gold mining in rainforest areas is profoundly destructive; gold extraction uses mercury, which gets washed into the river, contaminating the fish. The river is also contaminated by oil, leaking batteries and other discharges, and silted up with soil and stones dug out of the forest in vast swathes. Flora and fauna are destroyed. The Shipibo see this as colonisation - a conquest in a long tradition. </p> <p>With whoops and clapping, the Shipibos reach the first mine. The manager and owner sit in their shack, behind a set of scales for weighing the gold. Ranged around the hut on small hilltops are young Shipibo archers, bows drawn, ready for defence. They fear that, as in other protests against mining, the miners will set dogs on them, or shoot them. </p> <p>The talking begins. The Shipibos explain their views politely. Their way of negotiating has a graceful, fundamental democracy: the leaders report what the community's wishes are - it is not their role to do more. </p> <p>The mine owner tells them he has no intention of leaving. Instead he offers them money. All hell breaks loose. \"You came and destroyed our land and you offer us dollars. Tranquillity is worth more than dollars,\" says their leader. In a symbolic act, the shaman takes out his machete and begins sharpening his arrows. </p> <p>The Shipibos reboard the canoes to head for the next mine. This is the big one. Acre after acre of jungle surrounding a long-loved lake has been turned to shingle and dust. The Shipibo had wanted to build an eco-tourist lodge, which they would manage. But this sustainable project has been blasted away by the mining. </p> <p>Where they remember dense forests shimmering with life, they now walk through a devastated land, appalled. Small fires burn, charred tree stumps scrape the empty horizons, rusting machinery litters puddles of water thick with oozing oil. To the Shipibos this is tragedy. \"If the earth is maltreated, it's as if we ourselves are maltreated,\" says one of their leaders. </p> <p>The mine owner insists that, by holding a concession, he has the right to do this. It throws up one of the most malignant examples of laws governing land: the \"land\" belongs to the Shipibo, but everything underneath it and above it belongs to the state, and can thus be given to miners, making the idea of \"land\" paper-thin. It also clashes with the holistic indigenous world view which includes all land, including subsoil and trees. </p> <p>This land, repeats the owner, is my land. In sudden revolt, the Shipibos move to the heart of the mining operations and simply \"undo\" it. They dismember it, pulling out dredging pipes, carefully taking apart the platforms for sifting gold. Nothing is broken: \"Tranquillo, tranquillo,\" say the leaders. </p> <p>They meet no resistance. Night falls. The canoes head over to the far river bank. In minutes, wigwams are erected, with banana-leaf coverings for the torrential rain. In the cool morning, the canoes return to the mine. The police have arrived after being called by the miners. </p> <p>The Shipibos offer the police a guided tour of all the illegalities on the ground and of the international law on paper. Eventually the police draft an agreement setting a date for the miners to leave. For the Shipibos, it's a huge victory. And a moral victory for wise - and above all peaceful - direct action. \"Our way is not to be violent,\" they say.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Good for democracy</strong><br> </p> <p> You report that chief executives are uneasy about their role under a system of elected mayors (Clash of the titans, October 11). </p> <p>One can understand the unease when you know the pivotal position these unelected officers have enjoyed for so long; in many cases they are the major decision-makers, and not the politicians, and consequently are not held responsible by the public. In the changed town hall environment, their role will be advisory, along the lines, as David Clark intimates, of a Whitehall permanent secretary. </p> <p>Elected mayors have been a feature of local government life in many parts of the world. I was surprised that no reference was made to the role of a senior officer in the administration of an elected mayor.

Good mental health is something I know is important not only for the families I work with, but also for myself and my colleagues, yet it gets overlooked as the demands of the job take over and people become less willing to give up more time for others. </p> <p>Mujahid makes it seem so simple, so straightforward and so satisfying, and yet he clearly puts an enormous amount of time and effort into enabling others to maintain good mental health. His positive attitude reminded me why I chose this profession in the first place and made me realise I should try to take more notice of the times when I gain something from the work I do, as well as it helping other people. <br></p> <p><strong> Cintha Archer</strong><br> Berkshire <br></p> <p><strong> Pheasant shoot is no sport</strong><br> </p> <p> Following the article about pheasant shooting in mid-Wales (Feathers are flying, October 4), I offer my own account as one of the residents concerned.

The shooters, standing directly on the path, broke what I believe to be the laws of safety - and common sense. My wife, myself and others were deeply upset, intimidated and enraged, feeling ourselves to be physically endangered. </p> <p>Birds were reduced to pathetic bundles of feathers, crying, maimed and struggling on the ground. Later, they were gathered by the gamekeeper, still struggling, with no merciful dispatch to end their suffering. Where is the clean sporting kill professed to be the aim? </p> <p>The shooters were grim, stony-faced men, too intent on their \"sport\" to care for us mere locals, or our safety.

  "<p>Pioneer probation programmes involving intensive work with offenders with problems of violence, addiction and poor social skills, have led to dramatic falls in re-offending rates, according to new research. </p> <p>The Home Office Pathfinder projects, which have been developed by local probation services over the past two years, have resulted in a 15% drop in re-offending in some areas. They involve either group work or intensive one-to-one contact. </p> <p>These early results mean it highly likely such programmes will play a key part in the rapid expansion of probation work over the next three years. The home secretary, Jack Straw, has announced that an extra \u00a3100m is to be invested in probation, with an additional 3,300 staff recruited - a rise of nearly a third. </p> <p>The Home Office hopes to see the number of offenders taking such intensive courses rising from 10,000 during this financial year to 60,000 by 2004. Some 12,000 are expected to attend basic skills courses and 6,000 a programme designed to tackle drug addiction. </p> <p>The most encouraging results have come from an \"aggression replacement training programme\" in Wiltshire, which aims to tackle the problems of violent offenders. A study of 230 offenders who have gone through the programme shows that those attending the course had a re-conviction rate of 20.4% compared with 34.5% for those who had not - a fall of almost 15%. </p> <p>A second study which looked at the performance of a reasoning, rehabilitation and enhanced thinking skills programme, developed in prisons in England and Wales, has produced similar dramatic results. The study looked at 694 offenders who had undergone the programme and a control group of 304 who had not. For those categorised as at a high risk of re-offending, the programme reduced the re-conviction rate from 94% to 75%; for those at medium to high risk it cut the re-conviction rate from 79% to 44%; and for those at a low risk of re-offending from 14% to 4%. </p> <p>Harry Fletcher, of the National Association of Probation Officers, said the key to the success of the projects was the assessment of the risk of re-offending of each prisoner and the tailoring of the programme to their individual needs. </p> <p>The projects involve role-playing and gaining interpersonal skills.</p>",
  "<p>It is 20 years this month since Margaret Thatcher's dream of turning Britain into a nation of property owners - and Conservative voters - was enshrined in law. The 1980 Housing Act, which gave council tenants the right to buy their homes, was at the time hugely controversial. Today, it hardly merits a second thought. </p> <p>Right-to-buy can now been seen to have underpinned a fundamental change in society, breaking down the divide between \"working class\" - for which, read council tenants - and those with middle-class aspirations, who bought their own homes. Now, having an address on a council estate does not automatically earn a working-class tag. In many places, nobody any longer knows who is \"council\" and who is not. More often than not, nobody really cares. </p> <p>Gone, for people who chose to buy the homes they rented for years, are the days when they had to abide by rules and regulations about what they could change in their house. Gone are the restrictions on moving to another part of the country, either for a job or in retirement. But what has been left in its place? </p> <p>Alan Murie, professor at the school of urban and regional studies, Birmingham University, believes right-to-buy has, in part, been responsible for the increased divide between haves and have-nots. \"It has been good news for most people who bought, but is a one-dimensional policy,\" he says. \"This government is having to deal with the consequences of that. </p> <p>\"You've got the social exclusion unit talking about urban renewal. One of the contributory factors in that has to be the right to buy, which meant people with the fewest choices are concentrated on these estates. There is a greater concentration than there was before; a greater polarisation of society.\" </p> <p>It was in October 1980 that the Conservative government introduced its policy, giving 5.5m council tenants a chance to own their homes. Before then, you could only buy your council home if your local council agreed: many did not. </p> <p>Flagged as the \"sale of the century\", the right to buy was introduced in a \u00a3600,000 blaze of publicity, with Thatcher personally visiting some of the proud new home owners. It forced reluctant councils to sell properties at a price considerably below the open market value. And to add insult to injury, they could only reinvest 25% of the capital they raised on refurbishing remaining housing stock. </p> <p>Many councils fought it, while some members of white-collar public sector union Nalgo (now part of Unison) refused to process right-to-buy applications. Sheffield council took advertisements in its local papers explaining why it did not want to sell. Norwich went all the way to the high court in protest against then environment secretary Michael Heseltine, who was implementing the policy. Norwich lost. The rest is history. </p> <p>Although only 90,000 families bought in the first year - fewer than had been expected - the numbers gradually picked up, peaking in 1989 at 216,043. In 1997, only 70,961 homes were sold. But over 20 years, in England alone, a total of 1.4m homes passed into private ownership. </p> <p>Once drab and regimented council estates suddenly boasted Georgian-style bay windows, double glazing and new extensions at the back. Some took on mock-Tudor frontages. The Sunday People newspaper even ran a competition in 1982 offering a dream holiday for two to the reader for the best transformation of a former council home. </p> <p>Council house sales were regularly higher in London and the south-east. In other parts of the country, where the property market was less buoyant, the policy took longer to take off. In particular, sales in Scotland rose much more slowly than in England. </p> <p> In July last year, Newcastle council was selling homes for a nominal 50p in the notoriously difficult North Benwell area, in the hope of attracting young owner occupiers who would spend money improving the properties. </p> <p>\"In the north, prices are much lower,\" says Murie. \"They are not being bought by affluent people who do them up. Some are being bought by private landlords to let. You get people not being able to sell, for whom buying their home has been the wrong decision.\" </p> <p>Nationally, councils currently have a \u00a320bn backlog in repairs, says Murie. Many of those which once fought the sale of council homes are now forced to consider wholesale stock transfer because they cannot af ford the necessary repairs. Even in militant Sheffield, where 21,477 council homes have been sold since 1980, councillors are this week considering selling the remaining 63,500 properties they still own. </p> <p>\"We still have 11,000 inter-war properties that have not been modernised,\" says Janet Parry, who manages the team considering future options for Sheffield's council housing. \"The toilets are in the porch, they still have the original windows and the kitchens are very basic. To bring those up to standard would be too costly. Over the years, we haven't been able to borrow enough money to invest to the level that we need.\" </p> <p>Merron Simpson, policy officer with the Chartered Institute of Housing, believes it is not too late to improve the right to buy policy. \"The government is trying to give local authorities a stronger strategic role for housing in their area,\" she says. \"But right-to-buy cuts across any idea of strategy, because people can buy their homes after three years. The local authority has no control over that. </p> <p>\"They should also be able to exclude certain properties where demand is high, or in parts of the country, like rural areas, where there is very little council accommodation.\" </p> <p>Ask Murie if right-to-buy has been a success and he is non-committal. \"You could say so. Or you could quite easily say it was totally disastrous. If you are lucky enough to be in a good property in somewhere like Essex, then you probably would benefit. But if you were in Liverpool you could have a very different story to tell.\" </p> <p> <strong>High hopes, low points</strong><br></p> <p> Even in the affluent south-east, where most people who bought their council homes have made a handsome profit, some people have had their fingers burnt. </p> <p>In Grays town centre, Essex, the local council recently bought back 38 high-rise flats at a total cost of \u00a3950,000 after the owners found they could not sell them. Building societies were refusing to give potential new buyers a mortgage. Now the council is letting tenants-turned-owners revert to tenants again. </p> <p>\"I was the first person to run into problems,\" says Lyn Smallcombe, who has a two-bedroom, sixth-floor flat in Lionel Oxley House. \"I bought it in 1989 for \u00a320,750 and put it on the market for just under \u00a330,000 three years later. Six couples came to view it, but each one rang back and said they couldn't get a mortgage on it. </p> <p>\"I wrote to the Halifax, who my mortgage was with, and they said it was in an anti-social area, or that it was a non-conformist building, yet three years before they were quite happy to give the money out to me. </p> <p>\"Then the council - who owned the freehold - decided to improve the building by cladding it, putting new windows in and putting in a new lift. Some of us were left with a \u00a315,000 bill which on an unsaleable property was pretty high.\" </p> <p>Smallcombe and others in the same position began a seven-year battle with Thurrock district council, which was settled earlier this year. \"We kept pushing and pushing and eventually they bought us back, for the original price we paid, but dropping the \u00a315,000 charge for improvements. That way nobody won and nobody lost,\" says Smallcombe. </p> <p>\"It's a relief. It means that I can move on. I am 58 now and when I am 60, if I wanted to, I could go into a smaller place. But it will be a council one, though.\"</p>",
  "In early 1982, I was a junior officer on board the Royal Navy nuclear submarine HMS Conqueror when it torpedoed and sank the Argentinian cruiser the General Belgrano. Hit by two torpedoes on the afternoon of May 2, the ship sank within an hour, leaving approximately 290 crew members dead and a further 30 dying of burns and exposure as they took to their liferafts in the icy waters of the south Atlantic. <p>In early January 2000, I stumbled across a message on a website, in which an American gentleman, Lew Holt, asked if anyone knew of people who had served in HMS Conqueror. I responded that I had been in the submarine, and asked what I could do for him. </p> <p>Lew explained that his older brother, Bill, had served in the second world war on the light cruiser USS Phoenix - later sold to Argentina and renamed the General Belgrano. The Phoenix had survived the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, but Bill had died of tuberculosis shortly before the end of the war. Half a century later, Lew decided to compile a book about his brother and to research the history of the ship on which he had served and which was eventually sent to the depths of the south Atlantic. </p> <p>As our correspondence developed, Lew mentioned that he was in touch with a former Belgrano crew member, Captain Nestor Cenci, known universally as \"Coco\". On January 19 2000, I wrote to him for the first time. I told him that, while recognising that men on both sides had \"done their duty\", I nevertheless greatly regretted the heavy loss of life and hoped that he would feel able to write back and \"shake hands\", so to speak, via email. </p> <p>Just one day later, he did so. He told me that it was hard for him even to think of the sinking and that he preferred not to discuss it at this stage. As the ship's supply officer, he had been third in charge of the Belgrano during the Falklands War. He had retired from the Argentinian Navy in 1988 with the rank of captain, but had been unable to find work. I was thrilled to receive Coco's letter and, for the following few months, we exchanged emails. We did not talk about the Falklands or the Belgrano, but about family, where we lived and other mundane matters. </p> <p>As time passed, our cyber-friendship grew and I told Coco that I hoped I would be able to visit Argentina one day, and to meet him in person. Just a few months later, that aspiration became a reality when, one chilly morning in mid September, I arrived at Buenos Aires international airport. </p> <p>Coco was waiting for me as I emerged from the baggage hall. At 61, he looked slightly older than his years and stooped slightly. I dropped my bag, saluted him and then walked towards him. We immediately embraced, like old friends. He then drove me to his home in a suburb of Buenos Aires and introduced me to his wife, Martha. An enormous breakfast waited on the table and, between us, in my halting Spanish and his slightly better English, we were able to communicate. </p> <p>For some days, I stayed with Coco and his family and, on occasions, usually over lunch, when the wine bottle was more empty than full, we would speak of the Belgrano and her sinking. Memories came flooding back. </p> <p>By May 1 1982, Conqueror's sonar had already detected the cruiser Belgrano, and the Exocet-armed destroyers Hippolito Bouchard and Piedrabuena. The submarine shadowed the vessels and, while keeping watch on the periscope, I sighted the tops of masts on the distant horizon. Excitedly, I called out that I could see the vessels, and when I relayed the bearing, the sonar operators confirmed that the ships were indeed the Belgrano and her escorts. When I looked again on the same bearing, they were closer and I could see their hulls and make out that there were four vessels, apparently steaming abeam of each other and engaged in a fuel replenishment operation. It was a thrilling moment. </p> <p>For more than a day, unauthorised to attack the ships as they remained outside the British-enforced total exclusion zone, we shadowed the Belgrano group. The following day, May 2 1982, Conqueror received a signal authorising the submarine to attack the Argentinian ships. </p> <p>At 3pm, Conqueror's crew was called to action stations and the torpedo tubes were loaded. The atmosphere in the submarine's control room was intense yet each individual went about his job professionally and calmly as various orders were given to prepare for the attack. </p> <p>Around 4pm, the order was given to fire and three torpedoes sped towards the Belgrano. The seconds ticked away and my pulse raced. This was the moment for which we had all been trained, yet a moment which, I believe, few of us ever really thought we would encounter. Until the moment of firing, it was as if everything in our lives had been a dress rehearsal for a performance that would never be given. But at that moment, our lives changed and we knew that the dress rehearsal was over. The Belgrano had real people on board. And we had just fired three high-explosive torpedoes at her. </p> <p>Shortly after firing, we heard and felt an enormous explosion. Conqueror's commanding officer, Commander Chris Wreford-Brown, called out from the periscope that he could see flashes of orange flame. The submarine's control room erupted in cheers as we realised that the weapons had hit. </p> <p>At the moment that the first torpedo hit the cruiser, Coco was resting in his bunk. Suddenly, the lights extinguished, and he heard a muffled explosion. The ship seemed to rise out of the water, as if it had hit a sand bank. Fighting his way through the smoke-filled darkness, he rushed to his watchkeeping position on the bridge and, as he did so, the second torpedo tore off the Belgrano's bows. By the time he reached the bridge, the Belgrano was taking on a list, and Coco found the ship's captain, Hector Bonzo, trying to turn the stricken ship to port, to face the submarine and thus present a smaller target. But his efforts were in vain - the vessel's major systems were all destroyed and she was already listing heavily. </p> <p>While Coco clung to the Belgrano's bridge, Conqueror was diving deep, shuddering from the force of the explosions and wondering if the cruiser's escorts were dropping depth charges. The crew was no longer cheering. We ran for an hour, away from the scene of carnage, so that we could raise an aerial and tell the world what we had done. Thinking that we were being depth-charged and that the Argentian destroyers were hunting us, we carried out evasive manoeuvres. That evening we were all stunned at what had happened. Within 20 minutes of the attack, the Belgrano was heeling some 30 degrees and the order was given to abandon ship. Coco left the bridge and climbed down into his life raft. A storm was whipping up, and conditions were rapidly deteriorating. I felt myself blushing as Coco spoke, but there was no animosity in his voice. </p> <p>\"On my life raft, there were 33 men,\" he said. \"The life rafts were designed to hold 12 people\". He smiled. \"They were very good liferafts, yes, very, very good\". </p> <p>I asked him what it had been like in the rafts, waiting for rescue. He looked pained. \"Cold,\" he said, shaking his head, \"very cold. It was 36 hours before we were rescued. The sea was very rough, with 30ft waves. Fortunately, the body heat from 33 men enabled us to survive. Some life rafts had only four or five people in them, and they died from exposure\". I blushed again. </p> <p>On the night of May 2 1982, I - and many other of Conqueror's crew - found it hard to sleep. I wondered how many men had been killed. But while I lay, dry, in my bunk, Coco spent that night in mountainous seas, in bitterly cold conditions, with wounded and dying survivors around him. </p> <p>Some 36 hours after being torpedoed, the Belgrano's survivors were rescued by the Argentinian ships Hippolito Bouchard, Piedrabuena and Gurruchaga, and taken to the Argentinian naval base at Puerto Belgrano. </p> <p>\"The press were not allowed there,\" Coco explained. \"When you went home with HMS Conqueror, you had the press to meet you and your families to welcome you back. When we went home, there was no one. It was as if no one wanted to see us, as if we were to feel ashamed.\" </p> <p>He paused and looked sad. \"It was a terrible time, a really terrible time. But the worst moment of all came when we assembled in an aircraft hangar to work out who was alive and who wasn't. We called out the names of the crew. Sometimes there would be a response and you knew that the person was alive. But often there was no response, and you knew, with great sadness, that the person was dead.\" Coco's pension, after 30 years of service, is $1,200 (about \u00a3750) per month. Although he didn't say it, I sensed that he felt poorly treated by the navy, forgotten and put out to pasture. I asked him about Captain Bonzo and he told me that Bonzo had been \"sent into retirement\" and now spent his time trying to \"help\" the relatives of those who had perished on the Belgrano. </p> <p>One morning, a few days into my stay in Argentina, Coco said to me: \"Barcena wants to meet you.\" I asked him who Barcena was. \"Barcena? The captain of the destroyer, the Hippolito Bouchard\". </p> <p>The Bouchard had been escorting the Belgrano at the time of her sinking and it was reported after the war that the third torpedo fired by HMS Conqueror had actually hit the Bouchard but failed to detonate. Later it was found that she had four five-inch cracks in her hull and Barcena later told me himself that the torpedo had in fact exploded, but close to the destroyer rather than on contact with her. </p> <p>Captain Washington Barcena and his wife arrived at Coco's house around 8.30pm in the evening. He looked younger than his 61 years, wore a jacket and tie and had an air of formality about him. We shook hands and then sat down with a glass of wine. He spoke little English, and so Coco acted as interpreter. \"He wants to ask you a question,\" said Coco. \"Sethia,\" said Barcena, \"when did you first detect our ships?\" </p> <p>Did he mean me personally? I asked. He replied yes. It was an easy question to answer because the moment has remained vivid in my mind for the past 18 years. I told him that I had first seen the ships while on the periscope on May 1, but that they had been detected by HMS Conqueror prior to that first visual sighting.\" Without thinking, I then added: \"And I thought to myself 'What a great target that would make.' \" </p> <p>He nodded and I asked him if his ship had dropped any depth charges on the Conqueror or tried to find the submarine by operating his sonar. \"No,\" he replied, \"we never fired any weapons. What you felt must have been the exploding ammunition and boilers on the Belgrano. You see, we didn't have many weapons on board and we wanted to keep them, maybe for a later engagement. And the sonar - well, it was working but it was a very old and not much good.\" </p> <p>I asked Barcena if his ship had carried Exocet missiles, and he confirmed that it had, but when I asked Coco the same question, whether the Belgrano had carried Exocets, he laughed and told me that the Belgrano's carpenters had fabricated Exocet launchers out of wood, to make it look as if the cruiser carried the missiles. He added that the Belgrano was not even fitted with sonar. </p> <p>\"So what did you do once you realised that the Belgrano had been sunk?\" I asked Barcena. \"We moved away from the area,\" he replied. \"We were worried that the submarine might come back and try to attack us.\" Barcena excused himself and shortly returned with an envelope, which he handed to me. Inside was a photograph of the Hippolito Bouchard, and Barcena had written a moving note, saying that, while we had been enemies 18 years previously, he was happy to have personally met me and wished me all good things for the future. When he left, I said to Coco that I found it surprising that the Hippolito Bouchard had moved so quickly away from the area of the attack and Coco bowed his head and spoke quietly. \"I have often wondered,\" he said, \"why it took 36 hours for us to be rescued.\" </p> <p>A few days later, Coco excitedly announced that he had had a call from Bonzo. He said that he had previously tried to arrange for me to meet the captain of the Belgrano, but that Bonzo had retorted: \"Why would I want to meet a man who tried to kill me?\" A fair enough response, I thought. Now he had called again, to say that he would meet me in a cafe in downtown Buenos Aires. </p> <p>We arrived at the cafe early, and, as the minutes ticked by, Coco nervously tapped his fingers on the table. After a while, he sat up straight and said: \"He is here.\" </p> <p>I turned around and saw a man in a blue anorak walking slowly towards us. His face was grim, and I recognised him from an old photo I had seen. As he reached our table, I stood up and held out my hand. He took it and looked me in the eye. \"It's an honour, sir\", I said in my poor Spanish, \"finally to meet you.\" He simply nodded and sat down next to me. </p> <p>Although they had not met for many years, and although both had been retired from the armed forces for more than a decade and were of the same rank, I noticed that Coco always addressed Bonzo as \"senor\" - \"sir\". From time to time, Bonzo nodded and glanced at me, not in an unfriendly manner, but neither with palpable warmth.The two chatted, and occasionally I heard Bonzo mention my name. </p> <p>The atmosphere was tense, and while I understood snippets of their exchange, much of it eluded me. Bonzo then turned to me and spoke in Spanish. He told me that, in his view, the sinking of the Belgrano had been \"politically criminal\". I nodded and told him that I agreed with him and I felt that he hesitated at that, as if to take another, closer look at me. </p> <p>I asked Coco if it was true that the Belgrano had been steaming home to Argentina and he said that, yes, this was true. In Captain Bonzo's book, \"Los 1,093 Tripulantes\" (The 1,093 crew) Bonzo had suggested that he might, at a later stage, have changed course to the east, back towards the Falkland Islands, but both Coco and Barcena told me that they had been heading west, heading home. Bonzo's hands were unhealthily white with little flesh and tensed knuckles. While age had been kinder to him than to Coco, he nevertheless did not look a well man, and Coco told me that for this meeting, he had made his first unescorted excursion from his apartment in a long time. I felt, as we sat there and talked, that there was no personal animosity against the individuals who had carried out their duty in HMS Conqueror. But it seemed to me that Bonzo, in particular, harboured some resentment over the politics which had led to the sinking in the first place. He struck me as a proud man, a professional naval officer \"of the old school\", and I sensed that he regarded himself as a man who had been terribly wronged. </p> <p>I told both Bonzo and Coco that, for my own part, I felt no remorse at having carried out my duty, but tremendous remorse that that duty had required me to be a party to the sinking of the Belgrano, and I think that they both respected and understood this sentiment. </p> <p> Suddenly, Bonzo looked at me and said, in English: \"So you were born in Scotland? My wife and I were there, many years ago. It is a lovely country,\" and he smiled. The ice had finally been broken and his smile was genuine. Neither Coco nor myself had realised that he could speak English and, by doing so, I felt that he was extending an olive branch. </p> <p>We talked for an hour or so, and neither the Conqueror nor the Belgrano was mentioned again. There seemed to be no need to do so. A retired Argentinian naval captain, \"El Commandante\", as Bonzo is usually referred to, and a retired junior Lieutenant were chatting and drinking coffee in a cafe in Buenos Aires. One had had his ship torpedoed with the loss of 323 members of his crew. The other had been ship control officer of the watch of the submarine that fired the weapons. But at this moment, it was as if the singularity of the human spirit had bridged the gulf between victor and vanquished. </p> <p>Bonzo then put his hand in his pocket, turned to me, and spoke slowly. \"This\", he said, taking something from his pocket, \"is for you. And I want to make it clear that it is only for you, for no one else, do you understand?\" He then handed me a small ceramic brooch and told me that it was one of a series that had been specially struck for the survivors of the Belgrano. I was truly touched. </p> <p>The meeting was over. We stood up and shook hands and Coco and I turned around and walked out of the cafe without looking back. On October 6, I finally said goodbye to Coco and flew back to my home in St Vincent and the Grenadines. I had been in Argentina for nearly three weeks and had managed to put some ghosts to rest. I realised that Bonzo, Coco, Barcena and all of the others were no different to me. Men who had been doing a job, some well, some not so well. But men with the same humanity, the same pride, the same fears, the same frailties. </p> <p>Eighteen years ago, I should never have believed that one day I would count among my friends a man whom I had helped to send into the frigid waters of the south Atlantic and whose comrades I had helped to send to their deaths. But today I can.</p>",
  "<p>The first person I met at Eden-Olympia was a psychiatrist, and in many ways it seems only too apt that my guide to this 'intelligent' city in the hills above Cannes should have been a specialist in mental disorders. I realize now that a kind of waiting madness, like a state of undeclared war, haunted the office buildings of the business park. For most of us, Dr Wilder Penrose was our amiable Prospero, the psychopomp who steered our darkest dreams towards the daylight. I remember his eager smile when we greeted each other, and the evasive eyes that warned me away from his outstretched hand. Only when I learned to admire this flawed and dangerous man was I able to think of killing him. </p> <p> Rather than fly from London to Nice, a journey as brief as a plastic-tray lunch, Jane and I decided to drive to the Cote d'Azur and steal a few last days of freedom before we committed ourselves to Eden-Olympia and the disciplines of the Euro-corporate lifestyle. Jane was still unsure about her six-month secondment to the business park's private clinic. Her predecessor, a young English doctor named David Greenwood, had met a tragic and still unexplained death after running amok with a rifle. By chance, Jane had known Greenwood when they worked together at Guy's Hospital, and I often thought of the boyishly handsome doctor who could rouse an entire women's ward with a single smile. </p> <p> Memories of Greenwood were waiting for us at Boulogne as the Jaguar left the cross-Channel ferry and rolled its wheels across the quayside. Going into a tabac for a packet of Gitanes - illicit cigarettes had kept both of us sane during my months in hospital - Jane bought a copy of Paris Match and found Greenwood's face on the cover, under a headline that referred to the unsolved mystery. As she sat alone on the Jaguar's bonnet, staring at the graphic photographs of murder victims and the grainy maps of the death route, I realized that my spunky but insecure young wife needed to put a few more miles between herself and Eden-Olympia. </p> <p> Rather than overheat either Jane's imagination or the Jaguar's elderly engine, I decided to avoid the Autoroute du Soleil and take the RN7. We bypassed Paris on the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, and spent our first evening at a venerable hotel in the forest near Fontainebleau, spelling out the attractions of Eden-Olympia to each other and trying not to notice the antique hunting rifle on the dining-room mantelpiece. </p> <p> The next day we crossed the olive line, following the long, cicada miles that my mother and father had motored when they first took me to the Mediterranean as a boy. Surprisingly, many of the old landmarks were still there, the family restaurants and literate bookshops, and the light airfields with their casually parked planes that had first made me decide to become a pilot. </p> <p> Trying to distract Jane, I talked far too much. During the few months of our marriage I had told my doctor-bride almost nothing about myself, and the drive became a mobile autobiography that unwound my earlier life along with the kilometres of dust, insects and sun. My parents had been dead for two decades, but I wanted Jane to meet them, my hard-drinking, womanizing father, a provincial-circuit barrister, and my lonely, daydreaming mother, always getting over yet another doomed affair. </p> <p> At a hotel in Hauterives, south of Lyons, Jane and I sat in the same high-ceilinged breakfast room, unchanged after thirty-five years, where the stags' heads still gazed over shelves stocked with the least enticing alcohol I had ever seen. My parents, after their usual bickering breakfast of croissants and coffee helped down by slugs of cognac, had dragged me off to the dream palace of the Facteur Cheval, a magical edifice conjured out of pebbles the old postman collected on his rounds. Working tirelessly for thirty years, he created an heroic doll's house that expressed his simple but dignified dreams of the earthly paradise. My mother tipsily climbed the miniature stairs, listening to my father declaim the postman's naive verses in his resonant baritone. All I could think of, with a ten-year-old's curiosity about my parents' sex-lives, was what had passed between them during the night. Now, as I embraced Jane on the parapets of the dream palace, I realized that I would never know. </p> <p> Cheval might have survived, but the France of the 1960s, with its Routier lunches, anti-CRS slogans and the Citroen DS, had been largely replaced by a new France of high-speed monorails, MacDo's, and the lavish air-shows that my cousin Charles and I would visit in our rented Cessna when we founded our firm of aviation publishers. And Eden-Olympia was the newest of the new France. Ten miles to the north-east of Cannes, in the wooded hills between Valbonne and the coast, it was the latest of the development zones that had begun with Sophia-Antipolis and would soon turn Provence into Europe's silicon valley. </p> <p> Lured by tax concessions and a climate like northern California's, dozens of multinational companies had moved into the business park that now employed over ten thousand people. The senior managements were the most highly paid professional caste in Europe, a new elite of administrators, enarques and scientific entrepreneurs. The lavish brochure enthused over a vision of glass and titanium straight from the drawing boards of Richard Neutra and Frank Gehry, but softened by landscaped parks and artificial lakes, a humane version of Corbusier's radiant city. Even my sceptical eye was prepared to blink. </p> <p> Studying the maps, I propped the brochure on my knee-brace as Jane steered the Jaguar through the afternoon traffic on the Grasse road. The stench of raw perfume from a nearby factory filled the car, but Jane wound down her window and inhaled deeply. Our disreputable evening in Arles had revived her, swaying arm in arm with me after a drunken dinner, exploring what I insisted was Van Gogh's canal but turned out to be a stagnant storm-drain behind the archbishop's palace. We had both been eager to get back to our hotel and the well-upholstered bed. </p> <p> The colour was returning to her face, for almost the first time since our wedding. Her watchful eyes and toneless skin were like those of an over-gifted child. Before meeting me, Jane had spent too many hours in elevators and pathology rooms, and the pallor of strip lighting haunted her like a twelve-year-old's memories of a bad dream. But once we left Arles she rose to the challenge of Eden-Olympia, and I could hear her muttering to herself, rehearsing the risqu\u00e9 backchat that so intrigued the younger consultants at Guy's. </p> <p> 'Cheer me up, Paul. How much further?' </p> <p> 'The last mile - always the shortest one. You must be tired.' </p> <p> 'It's been a lot of fun, more than I thought. Why do I feel so nervous?' </p> <p> 'You don't.' </p> <p>I pressed her hand against the wheel, steering the Jaguar around an elderly woman cyclist, panniers filled with baguettes. </p> <p>'Jane, you'll be a huge success. You're the youngest doctor on the staff, and the prettiest. You're efficient, hardworking.... what else?' </p> <p> 'Slightly insolent?' </p> <p> 'You'll do them good. Anyway, it's only a business park.' </p> <p> 'I can see it - straight ahead. My God, it's the size of Florida...' </p> <p> The first office buildings in the Eden-Olympia complex were emerging from the slopes of a long valley filled with eucalyptus trees and umbrella pines. Beyond them were the rooftops of Cannes and the Iles de L\u00e9rins, a glimpse of the Mediterranean that never failed to lift my heart. </p> <p> 'Paul, down there...' </p> <p>Jane pointed to the hillside, raising a finger still grimy from changing a spark plug. Hundreds of blue ovals trembled like damaged retinas in the Provencal sun. </p> <p>'What are they - rain-traps? Tanks full of Chanel Number 5? And those people. They seem to be naked.' </p> <p> 'They are naked. Or nearly. Swimming pools, Jane. Take a good look at your new patients.' </p> <p>I watched one senior executive in the garden of his villa, a suntanned man in his fifties with a slim, almost adolescent body, springing lightly on his diving board. </p> <p>'A healthy crowd.... I can't imagine anyone here actually bothering to fall ill.' </p> <p> 'Don't be too sure. I'll be busier than you think. The place is probably riddled with airport TB and the kind of viruses that only breed in executive jets. And as for their minds...' </p> <p> I began to count the pools, each a flare of turquoise light lost behind the high walls of the villas with their screens of cycads and bougainvillaea. Ten thousand years in the future, long after the Cote d'Azur had been abandoned, the first explorers would puzzle over these empty pits, with their eroded frescoes of tritons and stylized fish, inexplicably hauled up the mountainsides like aquatic sundials or the altars of a bizarre religion devised by a race of visionary geometers. </p> <p> We left the Cannes road and turned onto a landscaped avenue that led towards the gates of the business park. The noise from the Jaguar's tyres fell away as they rolled across a more expensive surface material - milled ivory, at the very least - that would soothe the stressed wheels of the stretch limousines. A palisade of Canary palms formed an honour guard along the verges, while beds of golden cannas flamed from the central reservation. </p> <p> Despite this gaudy welcome, wealth at Eden-Olympia displayed the old-money discretion that the mercantile rich of the information age had decided to observe at the start of a new millennium. The glass and gun-metal office blocks were set well apart from each other, separated by artificial lakes and forested traffic islands where a latter-day Crusoe could have found comfortable refuge. The faint mist over the lakes and the warm sun reflected from the glass curtain-walling seemed to generate an opal haze, as if the entire business park were a mirage, a virtual city conjured into the pine-scented air like a son-et-lumiere vision of a new Versailles. </p> <p> But work and the realities of corporate life anchored Eden-Olympia to the ground. The buildings wore their ventilation shafts and cable conduits on their external walls, an open reminder of Eden-Olympia's dedication to company profits and the approval of its shareholders. The satellite dishes on the roofs resembled the wimples of an order of computer-literate nuns, committed to the sanctity of the workstation and the pieties of the spreadsheet. </p> <p> Gravel tore at the Jaguar's tyres. Waking from her reverie, Jane braked sharply before we reached the gatehouse, sending the old sports saloon into a giddy shunt. Two uniformed guards looked up from their electronic screens, but Jane ignored them, readying a two-finger salute that I managed to conceal. </p> <p> 'Jane, they're on our side.' </p> <p> 'Sorry, Paul. I know, we want them to like me. Open your window.' She grimaced at herself in the rear-view mirror. 'That cheap perfume. I smell like a tart...' </p> <p>'The most gorgeous tart on the Cote d'Azur. They're lucky to have you.' </p> <p>I tried to settle her hands as she fretted over her lipstick, obsessively fine-tuning herself. I could feel the perspiration on her wrists, brought out by more than the August sun. </p> <p>'Jane, we don't have to be here. Even now, you can change your mind. We can drive away, cross the border into Italy, spend a week in San Remo...' </p> <p> 'Paul? I'm not your daughter.' </p> <p>Jane frowned at me, as if I were an intruder into her world, then touched my cheek forgivingly. </p> <p>'I signed a six-month contract. Since David died they've had recruitment problems. They need me...' </p> <p> I watched Jane make a conscious effort to relax, treating herself like an overwrought patient in casualty. She lay against the worn leather seating, breathing the bright air into her lungs and slowly exhaling. She patted the dark bang that hid her bold forehead and always sprang forward like a coxcomb at the first hint of stress. I remembered the calm and sensible way in which she had helped the trainee nurses who fumbled with my knee-brace. At heart she was the subversive schoolgirl, the awkward-squad recruiter with a primed grenade in her locker, who saw through the stuffy conventions of boarding school and teaching hospital but was always kind enough to rescue a flustered housekeeper or ward orderly. </p> <p> Now, at Eden-Olympia, it was her turn to be intimidated by the ultra-cerebral French physicians who would soon be her colleagues. She sat forward, chin raised, fingers drumming a threatening tattoo on the steering wheel. Satisfied that she could hold her own, she noticed me massaging my knee. </p> <p> 'Paul, that awful brace... we'll get it off in a few days. You've been in agony and never complained.' </p> <p> 'I'm sorry I couldn't help with the driving. Cannes is a long way from Maida Vale.' </p> <p> 'Everywhere is a long way from Maida Vale. I'm glad we came.' </p> <p>She gazed at the office buildings that climbed the valley slopes, and at the satellite dishes distilling their streams of information from the sky. </p> <p>'It all looks very civilized, in a Euro kind of way. Not a drifting leaf in sight. It's hard to believe anyone would be allowed to go mad here. Poor David...'</p> <p> David Greenwood's death dominated our time at Eden-Olympia, hovering above the artificial lakes and forests like the ghosts of Princip over Sarajevo and Lee Harvey Oswald over Dallas. Why this dedicated children's doctor should have left his villa on a morning in late May and set out on a murder rampage had never been explained. He had killed seven senior executives at Eden-Olympia, executed his three hostages and then turned his rifle on himself. He had written no suicide note, no defiant last message, and as the police marksmen closed in he had calmly abandoned himself to death. </p> <p> A week before our wedding, Jane and I had met him at a London reception for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. Likeable but a little naive, Greenwood reminded me of an enthusiastic Baptist missionary, telling Jane about the superb facilities at the Eden-Olympia clinic, and the refuge for orphaned children he had set up at La Bocca, the industrial suburb to the west of Cannes. With his uncombed hair and raised eyebrows, he looked as if he had just received an unexpected shock, a revelation of all the injustices in the world, which he had decided to put right. Yet he was no prude, and talked about his six months in Bangladesh, comparing the caste rivalries among the village prostitutes with the status battles of the women executives at Eden-Olympia. </p> <p> Jane had known him during their internships at Guy's, and often met him after she enrolled with the overseas supply agency that recruited Greenwood to Eden-Olympia. When she first applied for the paediatric vacancy, I had been against her going, remembering her shock on hearing the news of Greenwood's violent death. Although she was off-duty for the day, she had taken a white coat from the wardrobe in our bedroom and buttoned it over her nightdress as she laid the newspapers across my knees. </p> <p> The entire London press made the tragedy its main story. 'Nightmare in Eden' was the repeated headline above photographs of Riviera beaches and bullet-starred doors in the offices of the murdered executives. Jane hardly spoke about Greenwood, but insisted on watching the television coverage of French police holding back the sightseers who invaded Eden-Olympia. Blood-drenched secretaries, too speechless to explain to the cameras how their bosses had been executed, stumbled towards the waiting ambulances, while helicopters ferried the wounded to hospitals in Grasse and Cannes. </p> <p> The investigating magistrate, Judge Michel Terneau, led the inquiry, reconstructing the murders and taking evidence from a host of witnesses, but came up with no convincing explanation. Greenwood's colleagues at the clinic testified to his earnest and intense disposition. An editorial in Le Monde speculated that the contrast between the worldly power of Eden-Olympia and the deprived lives of the Arab immigrants in Cannes La Bocca had driven Greenwood into a frenzy of frustration, a blind rage at inequalities between the first and third worlds. The murders were part political manifesto, so the newspaper believed, and part existential scream. </p> <p> When the case at last left the headlines Jane never referred to Greenwood again. But when the vacancy was advertised she immediately called the manager of the supply agency. She was the only applicant, and quickly convinced me that a long break in the Mediterranean would do wonders for my knee, injured in a flying accident nine months earlier and still refusing to mend. My cousin Charles agreed to take over the publishing house while I was away, and would e-mail me copy and proof pages of the two aviation magazines that I edited. </p> <p> Eager to help Jane's career, I was happy to go. At the same time, like any husband from a different generation, I was curious about my young wife's romantic past. Had she and Greenwood once been lovers? The question was not entirely prurient. A mass-murderer had perhaps held her in his arms, and as Jane embraced me the spirit of his death embraced me too. The widows of assassins were forever their armourers. </p> <p> On our last night in Maida Vale, lying in bed with our packed suitcases in the hall, I asked Jane how closely she had known Greenwood. She was sitting astride me, with the expression of a serious-minded adolescent on her face that she always wore when making love. She drew herself upright, a hand raised to hit me, then solemnly told me that she and Greenwood had never been more than friends. I almost believed her. But some unstated loyalty to Greenwood's memory followed us from Boulogne to the gates of Eden-Olympia. </p> <p> Baring her teeth, Jane started the engine. </p> <p>'Right... let's take them on. Find the clinic on the map. Someone called Penrose will meet us there. Why they've picked a psychiatrist, I don't know. I told them you hate the entire profession. Apparently, he was hurt in David's shoot-out, so be gentle with him...' </p> <p> She steered the Jaguar towards the gatehouse, where the guards had already lost interest in their screens, intrigued by this confident young woman at the controls of her antique car. </p> <p> While they checked our documents and rang the clinic I stared at the nearby office buildings and tried to imagine Greenwood's last desperate hours. He had shot dead one of his colleagues at the clinic. A second physician, a senior surgeon, had suffered a fatal heart attack the next day. A third colleague had been wounded in the arm: Dr Wilder Penrose, the psychiatrist who was about to introduce us to our new Eden.</p>",

  "<p>A few final chores and one choice job - test-driving a mini-jetpack - awaited a pair of astronauts Wednesday, the last of four days of spacewalks around the international space station. </p> <p>On their second trip outside space shuttle Discovery since Monday, spacewalkers Michael Lopez-Alegria and Jeff Wisoff had to clean up the top of the newly installed station truss for the arrival of a 240-foot pair of solar wings in December. </p> <p>The duo also had to deploy a tray on the truss that will hold connections between the station and the US Destiny laboratory module, scheduled for installation in January. But with that work out of the way, the spacewalkers were to fire up a mini-jetpack they had only experienced via endless practice in Nasa's virtual reality laboratory. </p> <p>Lopez-Alegria and Wisoff were enthusiastic about the tests well before launch. </p> <p>\"They want to do it and we want them to do it,\" said Daryl Schuck, the lead spacewalk officer in Mission Control. First, the duo had to attempt a few jetpack maneuvers about 40 feet above Discovery - 240 miles above Earth. </p> <p>Then, one at a time, they were to jet down to the rear of the cargo bay while one followed alongside on the end of the shuttle robot arm holding a tether - just in case. Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata was tasked with controlling the robot arm from inside Discovery.</p> <p>Flight director Chuck Shaw said the 50-foot trips, which were supposed to take about three minutes apiece, would be \"a little like watching paint dry.\" </p> <p>The rescue jetpack is not nearly the hot rod it would seem. Since it's built only to bring an errant astronaut back to the shuttle or the space station, each move has to be deliberate to conserve its limited fuel. </p> <p>Earlier astronauts have flown on a bigger jetpack designed for zooming around space, but Nasa stopped using those in the 1980s. In keeping with the rescue theme, Wisoff and Lopez-Alegria also planned to take turns acting as space lifeguards. One was to feign injury while the other carried him to safety, so Nasa could see how astronauts would handle an injured or incapacitated spacewalker. </p> <p>Discovery's other spacewalkers, Leroy Chiao and Bill McArthur, ventured outside for their second spacewalk of the mission Tuesday. They mounted two power converters on the truss and connected a few cables. Their spacewalk lasted about 17 minutes beyond its scheduled 6 1/2 hours. </p> <p>\"That might be attributed to Bill and Leroy's reluctance to come inside. They did make some comments about that,\" Schuck said. \"I really don't think that was a factor but I guess I can't blame them.\" </p> <p>At the close of Wisoff and Lopez-Alegria's spacewalk, their second of the mission, all that remains for Discovery's crew is a day inside the space station tending to various tasks. They'll pull away from the station Friday, leaving behind 10 tons of new space station pieces.</p> <p>Because Discovery has boosted the station's orbit, the launch of the orbiting outpost's first permanent crew from Kazakstan has been delayed one day, to October 31, Nasa said. The three men will arrive at the station on November 2.</p>",
  "In the late 1940s, Somerset Maugham, still at the height of his fame, was prevailed upon by the film producer Antony Darnborough, who has died aged 86, to travel from the south of France to Pinewood studios to introduce, on film, four of his stories in Quartet (1948). It was a real coup for Darnborough, a hands-on operator conscious of the need for British films to make money in the United States - and aware that Maugham was even more popular in the US than in England. <p>Darnborough went to great lengths to reproduce Maugham's study in the studio, even duplicating his favourite chair with worn patches on the arms. The 74-year-old author was so impressed with the rejuvenating effect of his make-up that he told Darnborough: \"I would wear it all the time if it were not for the possibility that people might get the wrong impression.\" </p> <p>Darnborough had the largest say in the selection of the stories, which were four of Maugham's most celebrated: The Facts Of Life, The Alien Corn, The Colonel's Lady and The Kite, each contrasted in mood, pace and rhythm, and each directed by a different director (Ken Annakin, Harold French, Ralph Smart and Arthur Crabtree), with superb casts that included Cecil Parker, Nora Swinburne, Dirk Bogarde, George Cole, Mai Zetterling, Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne. </p> <p>Quartet was a box-office hit, and Maugham was easily persuaded by Darnborough to return to do Trio (1950) and Encore (1951). The former was made up of The Verger, Mr Knowall and Sanatorium, while the latter consisted of The Ant And The Grasshopper, Winter Cruise and Gigolo And Gigolette. Again, excellent direction and fine casts - Nigel Patrick, Jean Simmons, James Hayter, Michael Rennie and Glynis Johns (to whom Darnborough was briefly engaged) - provided excellent entertainment. </p> <p>Those three omnibus films were Darnborough's greatest successes in a career as a feature-film producer that ran from 1947 to 1956. </p> <p>Darnborough was born in Weybridge, the son of wealthy parents. On leaving boarding school in St Albans, family connections got him a job as a Daily Mail gossip columnist, before wartime service in the Royal Artillery, during which he won a military cross. </p> <p>After the war, with the help of his brother-in-law, the film conductor and composer Muir Mathieson, Darnborough became production manager for Sydney Box at Gainsborough studios. His first film as producer was The Calendar (1947), a good Edgar Wallace racetrack melodrama, which was followed by My Brother's Keeper (1948), an effective piece about two escaping convicts, Jack Warner and George Cole, handcuffed together. Shot on location, it had a fresh- ness which suggested a new sense of direction in British cinema. </p> <p>Boys In Brown (1949), another realist film about criminals, now seems rather preachy and meek. The over-age borstal boys included whining Richard Attenborough, decent Jimmy Hanley, cocky Michael Medwin, and troublemaker Dirk Bogarde, with Jack Warner as their humane governor. Also among the boys was Graham Payn, Noel Coward's lover, trying to make a career as a film actor. </p> <p>Coward also helped Payn get a role in The Astonished Heart (1950), an adaptation of his one-act play, which Darnborough produced and co-directed with Terence Fisher. After Coward, who wrote the screenplay and music, saw some of the rushes, he decided that Michael Redgrave was not right for the piece, and took over the part himself - giving one his most stilted performances. </p> <p>Darnborough and Fisher also co-directed the intriguing So Long At The Fair (1950), based on the story of a man who disappeared without trace during the Paris Exhibition of 1889. It starred Jean Simmons and Dirk Bogarde. </p> <p>The rest of Darnborough's productions were competent rather than sparkling: Highly Dangerous (1950), a cold- war drama with Margaret Lockwood; The Net (1952), an aeronautics melodrama in which a communist sympathiser has ideas of sabotage; To Paris With Love (1955), a lightweight comedy with Alec Guinness; and The Baby And The Battleship (1956), featuring John Mills and a cute Italian child afloat during the second world war. </p> <p>In 1957, Darnborough formed a production company, which made documentaries and whisky advertisements. An excellent golfer and a lover of good wine, he is survived by Angela Beyfus, his wife for more than 40 years, and their son. </p> <p> Antony Darnborough, film producer, born October 6 1913; died September 24 2000</p>",
  "<p><strong>Australia</strong></p> <p>Michael Slater gave the Australian one-day selectors selectors a sharp elbow in the ribs as New South Wales crushed neighbours Victoria in the Mercantile Mutual Cup at the North Sydney Oval. He hit 61, including 18 off an over from Shane Warne, as NSW raced to their target of 194 with more than 14 overs to spare. Under new laws this season, NSW became the first side to pick up a bonus point for scoring at least 1.25 times as quickly as their opponents.</p> <p>Because of Australia's unexpected early departure from the ICC Knockout Trophy in Kenya, both teams had the luxury of fielding all their international players. But when Steve Waugh won the toss and asked Victoria to bat it was one of their lesser names that did the damage. Nathan Bracken, a 23-year-old left-arm seamer, took 4-36 as Victoria stumbled to 193. There were two wickets each for Shane Lee (2-33) and Stuart MacGill (2-40) but none for the international new-ball duo of Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee.</p> <p>NSW began explosively in reply. Brad Haddin creamed 69 off just 52 balls and added 109 for the first wicket with Slater. Warne, on his comeback after undergoing shoulder surgery, conceded 47 runs from six wicketless overs and was swiftly removed from the attack. Steve Waugh and Michael Bevan wrapped up the match in style.</p> <p><strong>Victoria</strong> 193 in 48.5 overs (BJ Hodge 87)<br> *<strong>New South Wales</strong> 197-2 in 35.5 overs<br> <strong>New South Wales won by 8 wickets</strong></p> <p> South Australia recorded their first win of the season when they beat Tasmania in a thrilling rain-affected match in Adelaide. Set 249 to win, Tasmania were on course while Ricky Ponting (68) and Michael Di Venuto (124) were adding 137 for the second wicket. And Di Venuto was still there with 10 needed off the last five balls. But he was brilliantly run out by the South Australian wicketkeeper Graham Manou, before Jason Gillespie bowled Dene Hills for 1 with a ball to go. Damien Wright needed to hit a six off the final ball to force a tie, but could manage just two. </p> <p>Earlier, SA made 248-6 off their 43 overs, with solid contributions from all the top order, although they were helped by some wayward bowling from the Tasmanians, who conceded 32 extras, including 23 in wides and no-balls. Gerard Denton, in his first match after a year's lay-off due to a back injury, conceded 40 off just three overs.</p> <p> <strong>South Australia</strong> 248-6 in 43 overs (JM Vaughan 57, CJ Davies 54)<br> *<strong>Tasmania</strong> 244-5 in 43 overs<br> <strong>South Australia won by 4 runs</strong></p> <p> In the first-class Pura Cup, Queensland looked to be off to a flying start as they ran up 442 in their first innings against Western Australia at Perth, thanks mainly to 175 from Jimmy Maher and 128 from Stuart Law. The situation looked even brighter when they bowled WA out for 195 (Adam Dale 5-41) enforced the follow-on and then reduced them to 43/3 in their second innings.</p> <p>It all started to go wrong after that, though, as a lifeless pitch and some uninspired bowling allowed Damien Martyn to dig in for 78, before an unbeaten sixth-wicket partnership of 166 between Durham's Simon Katich and Adam Gilchrist spared the Western Australian blushes. Katich's gritty 105 not out took nearly eight hours, while Gilchrist's unbeaten 109, including 15 fours, was more aggressive. He smashed Dale for four fours in succession, then hit him for three more in a row in Dale's next over. </p> <p><strong>Queensland </strong>442<br> *<strong>Western Australia</strong>195 and 349-5<br> <strong>Match drawn</strong><br> <strong>Queensland win on first-innings lead</strong><br> <strong>Queensland 2pts, Western Australia 0</strong></p> <p> <strong>India</strong></p> <p>The Rest of India thrashed Mumbai by 10 wickets as the Indian season got under way with its traditional curtain-raiser, the Irani Trophy. Mumbai, who were playing because they won last year's Ranji Trophy, started slowly in their first innings, but 56 from Wasim Jaffer, plus a late flurry by Ramesh Powar (40) and a last-wicket stand of 42 between Nulesh Kulkarni (14*) and Santosh Saxena (27) edged them towards a respectable 260. Offspinner Sharandeep Singh (4-55) and slow left-armer Murali Kartik (4-73) were the best of the Rest. The Rest's first innings was tottering at 29-3 before VVS Laxman took over - he stroked his way to 167 with impeccable timing, taking few risks along the way, and was backed up by Mohammed Kaif (75), with whom he shared a fourth-wicket stand of 201, and Jacob Martin (51).</p> <p>History beckoned in the Mumbai second innings, as Kartik picked up the first nine wickets in a bid to become only the fifth Indian to take all ten in a first-class game. It was not to be, though, as Singh snapped up the wicket of No. 11 Santosh Saxena for a first-ball duck. There was some consolation for Kartik as his figures of 9-70, coming off an unchanged spell of 24 overs, were a new record for the Irani Trophy. It gave him match figures of 13-143. The Rest, needing only 56 to win, quickly polished them off without loss to retain the trophy.</p> <p>*<strong>Mumbai</strong> 260 and 184<br> <strong>Rest of India</strong> 389 and 58-0<br> <strong>Rest of India won by 10 wickets</strong></p> <p> <strong>Pakistan</strong></p> <p>There were runs aplenty in the opening round of matches in the first-class Quaid-e- Azam Trophy first division, with no fewer than 10 centuries in the six matches. There were big wins for Sargodha, who beat Sheikhupura, and Faisalabad, who defeated Gujranwala. And, in two high-scoring matches, Lahore Blues beat Lahore, while Karachi overturned Karachi Blues, the highlight of the match being scores of 100* and 50* for Hasan Raza, who made his Test debut four years ago at the alleged age of 14. Peshawar and Rawalpindi fought out a draw, as did Bahawalpur and Islamabad.</p> <p><strong>Sargodha</strong> 212 (Naveed Latif 64, Jaffer Nazir 6-62) and 254 (Misbah-ul-Haq 102, Kashif Raza 5-52)<br> *<strong>Sheikhupura</strong> 209 and 131 (Ahmed Hayat 5-62)<br> <strong>Sargodha won by 126 runs</strong></p> <p><strong>Gujranwala</strong> 302 (Imran Abbas 105, Aqeel Ahmed 7-115) and 102 (Farooq Iqbal 5-16)<br> *<strong>Faisalabad</strong> 287 (Fida Hussain 116*, Farooq Iqbal 53) and 119-0 (Ijaz Mahmood 79*)<br> <strong>Faisalabad won by 10 wickets</strong></p> <p>*<strong>Karachi</strong> 315/5 dec (Zeeshan Perviz 115, Hasan Raza 100*) and 244/3 dec (Shahid Afridi 56, Mohammad Masroor 55*, Hasan Raza 50*)<br> <strong>Karachi Blues</strong> 312 (Afsar Nawaz 165) and 167 (Adnan Malik 5-47)<br> <strong>Karachi won by 80 runs</strong></p> <p><strong>Lahore Blues</strong> 471 (Shahid Anwar 100, Intikhab Alam 77) and 187-8 dec<br> *<strong>Lahore</strong> 325-7 dec (Taufeeq Umar 120, Ali Hussein 92) and 190 (Taufeeq Umar 57, Mohammad Hussain 5-77)<br> <strong>Lahore Blues won by 143 runs</strong></p> <p><strong>Peshawar</strong> 282 (Naheem Akhtar 5-79) and 270/9 (Younis Khan 74, Yasir Arafat 6-66)<br> *<strong>Rawalpindi</strong> 234 (Perviz Aziz 57, Fazl-e-Akbar 5-80) <br> <strong>Match drawn</strong></p> <p><strong>Islamabad</strong> 436-9 dec (Zaheer Abbasi 127, Bilal Asad 86) and 104 (Imran Adil 5-36)<br> *<strong>Bahawalpur</strong> 309 (Hamad Tariq 134, Kamran Hussain 53) and 19-0<br> <strong>Match drawn</strong></p> <p> <strong>West Indies</strong></p> <p>The new expanded Red Stripe Bowl is underway, with Canada, the USA, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands joining the six traditional regional sides. And USA caused the sensation of the early rounds by beating Barbados by two wickets at Sabina Park - their first win since joining the competition three years ago. Barbados, whose side contained five internationals, including Adrian Griffith and Philo Wallace, were skittled for 129 in 38 overs with spinner Rudy Narine taking 4-35. USA then reached 98-3, lost five wickets for 21, before sneaking home with one over to go. </p> <p>Earlier in the competition, the underdogs all got off to the worst possible start, losing their first matches in one-sided fashion. Laurie Williams took 5-12 from 9 overs as Jamaica crushed the USA, and Carl Hooper played his first game after 'retiring' 18 months ago - he made 41 from just 43 deliveries as Guyana defeated the Cayman Islands. </p> <p>Barbados scored only 185 against Trinidad and Tobago, but then dismissed them for 118. The absence of Brian Lara through injury helped. Jamaica, the defending champions, had big wins against the USA and Trinidad and Tobago, but crashed to a 49-run defeat against Barbados after four run-outs in the space of four overs.</p> <p>*<strong>Jamaica</strong> 264-4 in 50 overs<br> <strong>USA</strong> 157-7 in 50 overs<br> <strong>Jamaica won by 107 runs</strong></p> <p>*<strong>Canada</strong> 138 in 48.2 overs<br> <strong>Barbados</strong> 139-3 in 32.4 overs<br> <strong>Barbados won by 7 wickets</strong></p> <p><strong>Guyana</strong> 224-9 in 49 overs<br> *<strong>Cayman Islands</strong> 75 in 33.5 overs<br> <strong>Guyana won by 149 runs (D/L method)</strong></p> <p><strong>Bermuda</strong> 129 in 46 overs<br> *<strong>Leeward Islands</strong> 133-5 in 39.2 overs<br> <strong>Leeward Islands won by 5 wickets</strong></p> <p>*<strong>USA</strong> 81 in 29.3 overs<br> <strong>Canada</strong> 82-4 in 21.3 overs<br> <strong>Canada won by 6 wickets</strong></p> <p>*<strong>Barbados</strong> 185 in 49.4 overs<br> <strong>Trinidad and Tobago</strong> 118 in 43 overs<br> <strong>Barbados won by 67 runs</strong></p> <p>*<strong>Bermuda</strong> 250-6 in 50 overs<br> <strong> Cayman Islands</strong> 127-7 in 50 overs<br> <strong>Bermuda won by 123 runs</strong></p> <p>*<strong>Windward Islands</strong> 104 in 36.3 overs<br> <strong> Guyana</strong> 107-3 in 37 overs<br> <strong>Guyana won by 7 wickets</strong></p> <p><strong>Barbados</strong> 223-8 in 50 overs<br> *<strong>Jamaica</strong> 174-8 in 50 overs<br> <strong>Barbados won by 49 runs</strong></p> <p>*<strong>Windward Islands</strong> 252-5 in 50 overs<br> <strong> Bermuda </strong>147 in 43.3 overs<br> <strong>Windward Islands won by 105 runs</strong></p> <p>*<strong>Guyana</strong> 180 in 49.1 overs<br> <strong>Leeward Islands</strong> 181-5 in 49.2 overs<br> <strong> Leeward Islands won by 5 wickets</strong></p> <p>*<strong>Trinidad and Tobago</strong> 145 in 50 overs<br> <strong>Jamaica</strong> 146-1 in 37.4 overs<br> <strong>Jamaica won by 9 wickets</strong></p> <p><strong>Leeward Islands</strong> 174 in 49.1 overs<br> *<strong>Windward Islands</strong> 178-5 in 41.3 overs<br> <strong>Windward Islands won by 5 wickets</strong></p> <p>*<strong>Bermuda</strong> 181 in 50 overs<br> <strong>Guyana</strong> 183-3 in 43.2 overs<br> <strong>Guyana won by 7 wickets</strong></p> <p><strong>Canada</strong> 149 in 47.4 overs<br> *<strong>Trinidad and Tobago</strong> 151-5 in 46 overs<br> <strong>Trinidad and Tobago won by 5 wickets</strong></p> <p>*<strong>Cayman Islands</strong> 91 in 42 overs<br> <strong>Leeward Islands</strong> 94-1 in 8.3 overs<br> <strong>Leewards won by 9 wickets</strong></p> <p><strong>Barbados</strong> 129 in 38 overs<br> *<strong>USA</strong> 130-8 in 49 overs<br> <strong>USA won by 2 wickets</strong></p> <p> <strong>South Africa</strong></p> <p>A rumbustious century by 37-year-old former international Mike Rindel helped Easterns to a formidable total of 232/9 off their 45 overs and set up victory against Kwa-Zulu Natal in the one-day Standard Bank Cup in Benoni. Rindel dominated the scoring: his 128 came off 139 balls and included 18 fours, and the next highest score was Derek Crookes' 37. In reply Kwa-Zulu Natal collapsed against the new-ball pairing of Kenny Benjamin, the former West Indian Test player, and Andre Nel, who each took 3-25 from 9 overs. The total of 153 could have been a lot worse had it not been for a last-wicket stand of 50 between Kyle Bender and Gary Gilder. Gilder, batting at No. 11, top-scored for Kwa-Zulu Natal with 36 off just 28 balls, including an astonishing four consecutive sixes off the bowling of offspinner Derek Crookes.</p> <p>*<strong>Easterns</strong> 232-9 in 45 overs<br> <strong>Kwa-Zulu Natal</strong> 153 in 40.3 overs <br> <strong>Easterns won by 79 runs</strong></p> <p> On a good batting pitch at Bloemfontein a Northern total of 191 never looked enough, but Free State made it hard for themselves, struggling to 194-7 with 11 balls left. Northerns had collapsed to 58-5 before Martin van Jaarsveld (88) and Finley Brooker (39) added 99 for the sixth wicket. Free State laboured in reply but wicketkeeper-captain Gerard Brophy pushed his side over the line with 47, to add to the five dismissals (four caught, one stumped) he had taken earlier in the day.</p> <p><strong>Northerns</strong> 191-8 in 45 overs <br>*<strong>Free State</strong> 194-7 in 43.1 overs<br> <strong>Free State won by 3 wickets</strong></p> <p> In an exciting finish Eastern Province dismissed Boland with one ball to go at Port Elizabeth to win by one run. Boland went into the last over with nine wickets down and needing six runs to win, but Henry Williams, recently banned from international cricket until the new year for his part in the Cronje affair, was run out off the penultimate ball with two needed. Mfuneko Ngam, a fast-medium right-armer who recently toured West Indies with South Africa A, took 4-26. Poor batting had earlier reduced Eastern Province to 45-6 in their innings, but they were rescued by Justin Kemp (95*) who put on an unbeaten 62 for the 8th wicket with Meyrick Pringle (25*). </p> <p>*<strong>Eastern Province</strong> 183-7 in 45 overs<br> <strong>Boland</strong> 182 in 44.5 overs<br> <strong>Eastern Province won by 1 run</strong></p> <p> With regular opener Andrew Hall away on duty with the South African national team, Sven Koenig stepped into the breach and scored 109 for Gauteng against Border, laying the foundations for a dramatic victory in the process. He received little support from the rest of the order, however, although Darryl Cullinan did contribute a cameo 39 off 36 balls. In reply Border captain Pieter Strydom struck 89 not out, and Steven Pope made 63, but they couldn't make up for a slow start and fell agonisingly short at the end of their 45 overs.</p> <p>*<strong>Gauteng 229-9</strong> in 45 overs<br> <strong>Border</strong> 223-7 in 45 overs<br> <strong>Gauteng won by 6 runs</strong></p> <p> North West beat Western Province by four wickets at Potchefstroom, despite 106 from Graeme Smith and a 54-ball 58 from ex-Zimbabwe international Neil Johnson. North West responded well with a fine opening partnership from Glen Hewitt (42) and Hendrik de Vos (82*), but they were falling behind the required run-rate before West Indian Mark Lavine blasted 44 off 21 deliveries, including two fours and four sixes. It allowed de Vos to guide them home with one ball to spare.</p> <p>*<strong>Western Province</strong> 258-5 in 45 overs<br> <strong>North West</strong> 261-6 in 44.5 overs<br> <strong>North West won by 4 wickets</strong></p> <p><em>Catherine Hanley is an Australian who supports Somerset but lives and works in Sheffield</em></p>",

  "\"Lennon attacked with wooden stick outside apartment house,\" reads the headline in the Chicago Times, \"Expected to make full recovery.\" The story goes on to announce how a recovering Lennon has spoken about the reforming of the Beatles. The date on the paper is December 1980. <p>Another headline from the same newspaper 17 years earlier reads: \"Kennedy struck by rock in failed assassination attempt.\" The sub-head reads: \"A conspiracy of multiple hurlers is not ruled out.\" The date is November 1963 and the front page goes on to explain how Kennedy is preparing to withdraw US troops from Vietnam. A third front page is dated April 1968. \"Martin Luther King is hit by bottle in Memphis.\" The sub-head suggests that, while recovering, King has announced his plans to run for president in 1972. </p> <p>The three mock front pages have been causing people to stop and read further in Los Angeles over the last week or two. Imagine indeed. What would a live John Lennon have been up to these days? Would he still be performing? Would he have been singing for Ralph Nader in his election bid or would he have been taking part in Al Gore fund raisers? Would he be telling people not to bother voting? Would he even still be living in the United States? </p> <p>And John F Kennedy? Would he have been laid low by the likes of Kenneth Starr, his private life exposed by a less deferential press? Would he really have ended the war in Vietnam? Would he now be the elder statesman, sharing jokes with Bill Clinton, or would he be advertising cures for bad backs? </p> <p>And Martin Luther King - would he really have been the first black president of the United States? Would he have managed to change the course of history? At least we would have experienced a presidential campaign where one of the candidates knew how to make a decent speech. </p> <p>The link between the three stories, of course, is that all three had their lives cut short by guns. The posters are the work of a gun reform group who would like to see the issue of gun control debated more in the current elections. </p> <p>It is clear who the gun lovers would like to see in the White House. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has even congratulated itself on the fact that if George W Bush gets elected, the NRA will have its own office in the White House. </p> <p>Al Gore has made it clear that he does not want to curtail the rights of hunters, of people who want guns in their own homes for protection or of sportsmen. His proposals for change are modest. But now that the three presidential debates are over, it is clear that once again the whole issue of guns is one that is not going to be seriously argued. </p> <p>Guns are used in 61% of the 31,000 annual homicides in the US and in 68% of the 33,000 suicides. Gun ownership in the US has gone up by 50% in the last three decades. </p> <p>But just as neither Mr Gore nor Mr Bush were prepared to disagree over the death penalty in Tuesday night's debate, so the whole subject of firearms has not really been allowed onto the agenda. </p> <p>Last week, real headlines reported the news that a 12-year-old girl had been killed by a drive-by shooting. It looks as though it will be a long time before we are reading about children hurt slightly on the arm by a stone thrown from a car.</p>",

The rain would not have been so lethal had it not been for decades of human greed, incompetence and complacency. </p> <p>Sharing responsibility are politicians, civil servants, developers, farmers, businessmen and voters. </p> <p>In the past, swollen rivers drained harmlessly into fields that lined their banks. That was why they were called flood plains. But farmers flattened, cultivated and smoothed the fields so the water surged into towns instead. </p> <p>A 1994 law forbade any new buildings within 150 metres of rivers. But developers edged right up to the banks, illegal but easy to arrange with the connivance of corrupt zoning officials. </p> <p>Unbelievably, some buildings were actually sited on river beds. Others were plonked on landfills near rivers, narrowing their flow. That's what did it for 12 disabled campers and their helpers swept away in a flash flood last month in Soverato, in southern Italy. </p> <p>The same blunder happened in Robassomero, just outside Turin. The beds of tributaries of the Po river were cemented over, cramping the flow and making it faster. </p> <p>The World Wildlife Fund and other environmental groups repeatedly warned that hydraulic projects in the Dora Baltea river in the northeast were dangerous. But just as in Soverato, the warnings were ignored. </p> <p>A state of emergency remained in force in the northeast, where road, rail and telephone links were cut. Factories, schools and shops were closed in many towns and cities. Twenty-one of the 28 confirmed deaths were in Italy. </p> <p>\"Out of respect for the victims of this and past tragedies, authorities should spare us their attempts to justify decades of inappropriate measures and inaction with references to the cruelty of the weather, to the country's complex fluvial system and to the fables of natural disaster,\" said the Corriere della Sera newspaper. </p> <p>An independent panel of experts who studied the Po river said the calamity was \"strongly dependent upon the actions of man\". </p> <p>The government said exceptional rainstorms had failed to wreak as much havoc as in 1994, when opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi was in power. Mr Berlusconi's media empire scoffed. </p> <p>Shoddily built apartment blocks that collapsed, such as the one in Foggia which killed 67 people last November, lengthen the list of tragedies exacerbated by human greed or error. </p> <p>Deforestation, unregulated construction and inadequate drainage maintenance were also blamed for the death of more than 140 people in a mudslide that buried the southern town of Sarno in May 1998. </p> <p>What emergency crews are really clearing up is the rubble of the state.</p>",
  "<p>England's fast bowlers took one look at the pitch at the National stadium here and walked hastily away, as one might from a particularly nasty accident. </p> <p>There was little grass, so they can forget about seam movement. And although the pitch had been rolled and was hard enough to resemble polished concrete, not much bounce can be expected. Neither will there be much in the way of conventional swing, for the Kookaburra balls will soon lose their shine. </p> <p>Oh, and it was hot too. It has been as high as 37C this week, just a bead of perspiration below 100F, and it seems even hotter in the shadowless interior of this concrete-bowl stadium. Cheltenham it ain't. </p> <p>England's quick bowlers are not fast enough to cause problems with pace alone, and Andy Caddick, the best of them when on song, is most effective when bowling aggressively just short of a length with bounce and seam movement and will therefore be restricted when the tour opens here on Friday with a one-day warm-up game against a Governor's XI. </p> <p>So it is the reverse swingers, Darren Gough, Craig White and, when the three-Test series starts on November 15 in Lahore, Dominic Cork who may be the key bowlers. Gough and White ruefully acknowledged this after their first net session here, a sweaty three-hour job that had them grabbing for the bottled water like men in the Gobi with a dodgy compass. Forget thigh strains, meltdown may be the killer here. </p> <p>\"I think both Chalks [White] and myself will be expected to reverse it,\" said Gough. \"I think I will open up with Andy. But I will probably come off after a few overs with a view to coming back. </p> <p>\"I learned to reverse by looking at Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. In fact I bowl a little like Waqar. But in Pakistan, until now, I've only bowled with a white ball [in the 1996 World Cup].\" </p> <p>Last summer White made a considerable impact against West Indies. He is able to generate real pace with his slingshot action, even though he ambles in off a short run. But his ability to reverse - he developed a particularly troublesome line against the left-handers - made him one of the successes of the season. </p> <p>\"Basically I learned to do it by watching others,\" said this former purveyor of gentle off-spin. \"It's something you pick up in the dressing room.\" </p> <p>Reverse swing probably originated in Pakistan, where the bowlers constantly work on the ball to counter the discouraging conditions. It was employed long before Imran Khan refined it and, with his hostile pace, made it most effective. But it is in the past decade, through the deeds of Wasim and Waqar, that it has become a voguish weapon. </p> <p>Gough, for the moment, is more concerned with the three-match one-day series, which starts here on Tuesday. \"I'm just thinking about how to control the ball for the first 15 overs. For me, this is when these matches will be decided, as we saw in the World Cup that was held here.\" </p> <p>Wasim, meanwhile, has responded to the call from the ECB chairman Lord MacLaurin for the former captain and the other five players implicated and fined after the Qayyum match-fixing report to be stood down for the Test series. \"I strongly condemn that, and all such calls are unnecessary and negative tactics before the all-important Test series,\" Wasim said. \"These people are trying to distract us.\" </p> <p>The journalist insulted by Mike Atherton during the 1996 World Cup has threatened to sue him unless the former England captain offers a public apology within 10 days. Asghar Ali had posed a question in broken English and Atherton had retorted: \"Can someone get this buffoon out of here?\" </p> <p>\u0095 Lawyers for the disgraced Hansie Cronje have confirmed that the former South Africa captain will sue the United Cricket Board after it failed to rescind his life ban.</p>",
  "<p>Gary was 14 when he started robbing people, sometimes with threats, and stealing cars. \"I got in with the wrong crowd,\" he says. \"I was arrested by the police four times, but there were many other times when I didn't get caught.\" </p> <p>At 16, Gary (not his real name) is already in danger of becoming a hardened criminal. But his involvement with a persistent young offender scheme in Manchester, where he lives in the Longsight district, is raising real hope that he can be put back on the straight and narrow. </p> <p>\"I am more confident and feel that I have got something going for me, which I didn't have before,\" says Gary. \"I have got a job now and it has given me hope for the future.\" </p> <p>The scheme, which is paralleled by one in nearby Bury, is the kind of approach that Jack Straw, the home secretary, wants to see developed across the country. He announced at the recent Labour conference that there would be a \u00a345m programme to create up to 50 such schemes, primarily in urban areas, to tackle the 3% of young offenders reckoned to be responsible for up to 25% of crimes. </p> <p>The approach could involve a volunteer mentor from within the offenders' own community, as well as professionals on the youth offending team. At its most intensive, it could involve offenders being supervised 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \"We realised that the majority of offences do not take place between the hours of 9 to 5 on weekdays,\" says a spokeswoman for the government's Youth Justice Board. \"They are more likely to take place late at night or at weekends.\" </p> <p>The Bury youth offending team was formed in October last year, working with young people aged between 10 and 17. Together with the Manchester team, it has been working since April on a \"prolific\" offenders' project developed along the lines of a Dutch model set up in Dordrecht, which has been associated with a 30% fall in burglaries. The Bury team has so far worked intensively with six persistent offenders, </p> <p>\"Bury is far from being the crime capital of the north-west,\" says team manager Graham Smyth. \"But it does have a group of persistent young offenders. The model is fairly simple and is based on what has been known anecdotally for a long time - that a very small group are committing a large number of offences. If you can make a difference to them, then it will have a knock-on effect in reducing crime and will be beneficial to everyone. </p> <p>\"We tell them that they are in the frame for extra attention from the police and that if they want to make a difference to their life we will offer them the maximum support. It is a carrot-and-stick approach really.\" </p> <p>Smyth says the team puts in place an intensive support package tailored to the specific needs of the individual. This could involve the youth working with police, probation officers, education welfare officers, social workers and careers officers to help move them away from offending. There are also parenting classes for families, if required. </p> <p>The first young person worked with on an informal basis, before the project began officially, has proven a success. \"He had just come out of prison when we started working with him,\" Smyth says. \"But he has been in regular work for the last six months. There were hiccups with the first job we got him, but with perseverence he made a go of it. Everything is going well and he has kept out of trouble.\" </p> <p>The team is not shirking the \"stick\" dimension of the approach, Smyth stresses. \"At the end of the day there is the law enforcement aspect and we can't pretend otherwise,\" he says. \"If they don't come here, then we take them to court.\" </p> <p>The project has funding from the Youth Justice Board, used to pay for an officer who can spend between three and five hours a week working on a one-to-one basis with offenders. Although the project does not maintain 24-hour surveillance, the team is considering a voice tracking system that would require offenders to call at set times from designated telephones. </p> <p>Dave Smith, a police officer who is part of the Bury team, is enthusiastic about the early results. \"The young lad who has got the job has got to be congratulated because he was prepared to work with us and to stay out of trouble. They basically have a choice - either to re-offend or to work with us and we will give them all the help and support we can.\" </p> <p>In Manchester, the central youth offending team in Moss Side has identified 10 persistent offenders to work with. Carol Stewart, team manager, claims a 70% success rate so far and says: \"We think it works.\" </p> <p>When Gary got into trouble for a serious motoring offence earlier this year, members of the team accompanied him to court because they felt they had started to work successfully with him. \"The court wanted to put him into custody, but we asked them to put a tag on him and we increased the supervision,\" says Stewart. \"The day he walked in here and he was no longer a scruffy young lad was a very happy day for us. He was a happy, confident young man who had got a job and was not offending any more.\" </p> <p>Nicola Kelly, Gary's support officer, says he has come along in leaps and bounds since they first met. He found a job in the catering industry after being helped by a careers officer. \"His gran has been very supportive and has worked closely with us. A lot of his family had distanced themselves from him because of his behaviour. </p> <p>\"We began by looking at when he was offending and we found that it always happened at night. Then we looked at the effects on victims and we watched videos where people had children who had died in car crashes. </p> <p>\"He became involved in the mentoring scheme where people helped to give him the strength to say no to his peers who were offending.\" <br></p> <p><strong>Admissions of guilt</strong><br></p> <p> Almost one in two young people admit to having committed a criminal offence, according to latest official research. But just 10% of those who do make such an admission account for almost half the crimes. </p> <p>The findings, published last week by the Home Office, are being used by the government to make the case for its focus on youth crime. They show that 26% of young men and 11% of young women admit to at least one offence in the 12 months before being questioned. </p> <p>Almost 5,000 young people aged 12-30 were surveyed for the research, part of the second youth lifestyles survey, conducted in 1998-99. The first survey was held in 1992-93. </p> <p>On average, the new research says, boys start offending at 13 and girls at 14. The peak age for offending is also 14 for girls, but 18 for boys - although this falls to 15 if fraud and workplace theft are excluded. </p> <p>The most common offences involve fights, buying stolen goods, shoplifting, other theft and criminal damage. Almost three-quarters of all offences involve property, with buying stolen goods and shoplifting accounting for 44% of offences by males and 24% of those by females. Among boys and men, the strongest predictor of crime is drug use. The research suggests the odds of offending are five times higher among drug-users than among others. </p> <p>Compared to the first survey, the rate of offending is little different overall. But it is significantly higher among boys aged 14-17 and lower among older men. </p> <p> Youth Crime: Findings from the Youth Lifestyle Survey is available free from the Home Office publications unit (020-7273 2084) or at <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/index.htm\">www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/index.htm</a> <br></p> <p> David Brindle</p>",
  "It didn't look like a ceasefire: a dozen young Palestinians, whirling slings at the Israeli blockhouse and waiting for the familiar crack of rifle fire from the concrete tower. <p>With the ink barely dry on the Sharm al-Sheikh agreement, Rachel's Tomb on the outskirts of Bethlehem was as much as a battleground yesterday afternoon as has been at any time in the bloody fortnight preceding it. </p> <p>Two Palestinians died and one Israeli was critically injured even before Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat flew home. And defiant voices on the ground insisted that whatever the summiteers had promised, violence would go on. </p> <p>\"They have to put an end to the Israeli occupation,\" Marwan Barghouti, leader of the Tanzim militia, declared. It is the Tanzim gunmen, ostensibly loyal to Mr Arafat and his Fatah group, who have been shooting at Israeli forces on an unprecedented scale - and drawing deadly fire in return. </p> <p>\"If they didn't deal with this issue, they didn't succeed,\" Mr Barghouti added. \"The peaceful intifada will continue.\" </p> <p>But peaceful it wasn't: across the wadi from Rachel's Tomb, between Palestinian Beit Jallah and the Israeli neighbourhood of Gilo, built on occupied land but now annexed to Jerusalem, machine-gun fire brought Israeli tanks into action. </p> <p>As terrified civilians fled outlying streets, an Israeli border policemen was shot. In all, 160 families were evacuated, a development which will increase Israeli fears. </p> <p>Later, senior army officers warned ominously that if Jews were forced to leave their homes - just 15 minutes from central Jerusalem - the same would happen to Palestinians. </p> <p>\"As long as there's still shooting this summit agreement is just talk,\" one Gilo resident, Rami Meyer, said. \"Barak signed and right away they opened fire.\" </p> <p>If implementation on the ground is the test of Sharm al-Sheikh, the omens were bad. Mr Barghouti's men will have to be disarmed, or at least stop firing, and abide by \"detailed security understandings\". </p> <p>Without that, Israel will clearly not feel bound to withdraw its tanks and heavy weapons - now stationed at roadblocks and outside most Palestinian cities. </p> <p>\"Fatah people and supporters were against the summit and we know that Arafat went there because of pressure on him,\" Bassam Naim, the Fatah leader in the West Bank town of Nablus, said. \"We cannot accept the resumption of security coordination.\" </p> <p>The trouble yesterday at Rachel's Tomb followed a wearily familiar pattern: 11 Palestinians were reported wounded as they hurled stones and petrol bombs at an army post. </p> <p>In a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle, it followed the death of a 15-year-old Muayed Darwish on Monday. He was shot dead as he took aim with a molotov cocktail from behind a makeshift barricade. As the boy from the Aida refugee camp was buried, mourners shouted: \"No to Sharm al-Sheikh, yes to armed struggle.\" </p> <p>\"Nothing will change now,\" one middle-aged onlooker said. \"Peace is for Arafat and Barak, but not for our people.\" </p> <p>Outside Nablus, a Palestinian farmer, named as Farid Nasrara, 28, was killed by Jewish settlers, who were later arrested. Three other villagers were injured. </p> <p>Palestinian witnesses said the shooting was unprovoked and that the man was simply picking olives. But Yehoshua Mor-Yosef, a settler spokesman, insisted the farmers had first attacked with knives and iron bars, and that the settlers had fired warning shots in the air before aiming. </p> <p>In the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian was killed and 10 more were hurt as hundreds threw stones at the Israeli military checkpoint at Erez. The army said a sniper also injured a firebomb thrower. </p> <p>The Israelis say they are firing rubber-coated bullets at firebomb throwers in order to minimise casualties - a claim greeted with incredulity by Palestinians, the UN and human rights groups. </p> <p>Security officials from both sides were due to meet last night to hammer out the understandings promised at the summit. The details will not be released. </p> <p>Pro-peace Israelis, devastated by recent events, said a ceasefire was not enough. Peace Now called for the disarming of Jewish settlers as a well as the Tanzim militia. \"Armed militias on the West Bank are a clear and present danger to the peace process and to Israel's security,\" it said. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "The Hatfield crash could not have come at a worse time for Britain's rail industry. After Southall and Paddington, this is the third serious accident in little over three years, and public confidence in the industry is shattered. <p>Hatfield happened as the industry appeared to be recovering after its fragmentation following privatisation four years ago. Passenger numbers have risen by 30%, more than \u00a330bn is to be invested in the industry by the government over the next five years and numbers are forecast to rise by a further 50% over the next 10 years. </p> <p>But the break-up has led to poor control. Railtrack, which operates track and signalling, has been a law unto itself, a private monopoly which bristles at regulation; the shadow strategic rail authority, a hybrid son of British Rail, has no strategy; and the 25 rail companies are either dominantly healthy or about to call it a day. </p> <p>Southall and Paddington highlighted gross deficiencies in rail safety. At Southall a driver passed through a red signal; the safety devices on his train which could have prevented the accident were not working. </p> <p>Paddington exposed even more critically the limitations of the privatised railway. A poorly trained driver passed through a red signal; he was unfamiliar with the key section of line outside one of Britain's biggest stations. </p> <p>The track outside Paddington had been remodelled to incorporate the new Heathrow Express. Railtrack and the industry did nothing to deal with expressions of concern about signal siting and the number of signals passed at red. In other words, the new loosely knit industry messed up. </p> <p>The crashes at Paddington and Southall exposed the lack of investment in safety. Instead of installing the expensive but superior system recommended 11 years ago after the Clapham rail crash, the industry and the government are still toying with a cheaper, less reliable alternative. </p> <p>It will cost around \u00a3400m to install and requires a further three years before it is adopted on wide sections of the rail way. Relatives of those killed at Paddington have called for the adoption of the automatic train protection system, at a cost of between \u00a31b and \u00a32bn. ATP is widely used in Europe, but the British are waiting for a more sophisticated model. </p> <p>Another key aspect of rail disasters is the inordinate amount of time it takes to identify the cause of a tragedy and then to apportion blame. The role of the railway inspectorate has also been exposed. Pitifully undermanned, the inspectorate has belatedly been told by the government that it can double its numbers from 70 to 140 between now and 2002. But this action has been forced on ministers after the inspectors were shown to be unable to carry out their job in the lead-up to Paddington. </p> <p>Another common thread running through the sorry history of Southall, Paddington and now Hatfield is underinvestment. Parts of the railway are still worse than before privatisation, and Guardian reports over the past three years have constantly underlined how railway staff have been struggling to maintain an inadequately funded industry. </p> <p>The government has to take its share of the blame. After Paddington, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, declared that money would be no object in ensuring the safety of the railway. </p> <p>What the government should have been saying was that it could not transform the industry overnight. Ministers misled the public into thinking that it was about to undo the evils of privatisation. But having set its face against renationalisation its hands were tied. </p> <p>The rail companies have been given watertight franchises for between seven and 15 years and continuing subsidies, allowing the better off among them to make good profits. </p> <p>Second-best safety equipment, ageing rollingstock and a poorly maintained track expose the frailties of the system as a rising number of passengers use it. </p> <p>The government would dearly like a short-term fix for the railway, but Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the shadow strategic rail authority, says he cannot throw money at it and expect overnight miracles. </p> <p>The sad fact is that despite new large-scale investment it will take some years before passengers see a marked improvement in performance. The railway is going to get worse before it gets better, as official statistics from the SSRA confirm.</p>",
  "A 10-year-old boy is set to become the youngest person in the country to be the subject of an anti-social behaviour order. <p>The 4ft tall child has wreaked havoc in the Wythenshawe district of Manchester, and has been arrested five times since his birthday three months ago.</p> <p>He has been known to police in the area since he was eight, but they were powerless to do anything until he reached 10 - the age of criminal responsibility.</p> <p>He has been arrested for stealing lager, cigarettes, a lighter and condoms from shops and is thought to be suspected of at least another 32 criminal offences.</p> <p>The boy has been caught shoplifting in Hadfield in the Peak District and at Manchester airport. He is also accused of stealing Pokemon cards from an older boy and assaulting the child. He has been bailed by police for the alleged offences.</p> <p>The boy's mother, who can not be named for legal reasons, said: \"He's no angel but he has emotional and behavioural difficulties. His school could not control him and he was excluded. It was 10 months before I could get him in somewhere else and during that time he got in with the wrong crowd.\"</p> <p>Superintendent Zoe Lord, of Wythenshawe police, said: \"If the position does not change, then he will become the subject of an anti-social behaviour order. He has been arrested five times since he was 10 and before he was 10 there were a number of incidents that we were aware of.</p> <p>\"We have done things to support him and to warn him about his behaviour, but nothing has had the desired effect.</p> <p>\"He is out of control because there are no boundaries or structures in his life. His mum does not seem able to control him and has had no effect on modifying his behaviour.\"</p> <p>The boy has been excluded from his primary school and has been offered a place in a secure establishment, but he rarely attends.</p> <p>She said other children were frightened of him and police were aiming to curb his behaviour before it worsened.</p> <p>Social services have suggested moving him from the area instead of seeking an order.</p> <p>At the Forum leisure centre, part of the Wythenshawe civic centre, which includes a theatre and library, the boy has set off fire alarms on two or three occasions, forcing evacuation of the centre.</p> <p>A shop worker, who did not want to be named, said the boy had terrorised locals and he was not alone. \"He is only the tip of the iceberg,\" he said. \"He and his friends are the 1% of youngsters who are spoiling it for the majority.\"</p> <p>At Wythenshawe civic centre yesterday afternoon, groups of six children in uniform hustled past the mounds of rubbish and construction work, shouting and laughing.</p> <p>But there were others, aged between 10 and 12, in casual clothes, darting between market stalls, pawn brokers and the Poundstretcher shop, throwing stones.</p> <p>William Jones, who has a run a market stall for five years, said traders and shop owners faced a huge problem with delinquency. There used to be gangs of 10-year-olds running amok through the markets, but they had not been seen for a few weeks, because of a police clampdown.</p> <p>\"The children shout, scream and thieve,\" he said. \"They mostly pick on women traders because they dare not mess with the men. But the biggest problem is in shops; the children know when security guards take their lunch hours.\"</p> <p>He said there was also a problem with groups of girls stealing purses and small items from stalls, but the worst problem was with heroin addicts, who stole things early in the morning, and with gangs carrying knives at night.</p> <p>If an anti-social behaviour order is granted by magistrates, the boy could be banned from shops and other areas of Wythenshawe. The orders were introduced last year under the Crime and Disorder Act as a last resort for offenders who make people's lives a misery.</p>",
  "<p>Police will today continue their search for Hannah Black, 13, a week after she was swept away by the swollen waters of a beck in the Yorkshire Dales. </p> <p>Hannah and 14 other year nine pupils from Royds School in Oulton, near Leeds, were on a week-long adventure trip supervised by two teachers. </p> <p>Some of the group are believed to have been walking up Stainforth Beck above the hamlet of Stainforth, three miles from Settle, when Hannah and her friend Rochelle Cauvet, 14, appear to have overbalanced after the boot of one of them was caught by a rock. </p> <p>The pair would have been carried down the beck, under a wooden bridge, through Stainforth under a trunk road and then into the river Ribble. </p> <p>Rochelle's body was found 18 hours after the accident in a bend on the Ribble, about four miles from where she waded into the beck. </p> <p>But the search for Hannah goes on, with police joined by army divers, canoeists from a cave rescue team and local volunteers. </p> <p>A North Yorkshire police spokesman said yesterday that the search will continue along the 50-mile length of the Ribble to its estuary at Lytham St Anne's on the Irish Sea. \"But we will be concentrating our efforts in the two or three miles closest to where Hannah went in,\" he added. \"Eventually there will come a time when we have searched the area completely and it is impossible to search any more -but we are still a long way from that.\" </p> <p>Liaison officers are still supporting members of Hannah's family and fiercely protecting their privacy during the agonising wait for news. </p> <p>Steve Finch of the Cave Rescue Organisation based at Clapham, north of Stainforth, said yesterday that more than 30 members had been involved in last week's initial search. The team's canoeists were back out on the river yesterday and the organisation was continuing to help police with advice based on local knowledge. </p> <p>\"The lower section of the river [close to Settle Junction, where Rochelle's body was found] is extremely dangerous when it is in flood,\" he said. \"In places, the river there is20 to 30 feet deep. That area can take people by surprise when they get down on the ground and look at it. </p> <p>\"We are supplying canoeists each day because that is the fastest way to check the entire length of the river. The police are concentrating on an extremely methodical search of the river with divers. </p> <p>\"It is very stressful for everyone. We are used to going in and hoping for a good result. Whatever we do, we normally have a resolution to it. But we haven't here. It is unfinished business. Everyone who has been involved is still very much on edge about it.\" </p> <p>Mr Finch suggested that if Hannah had not survived, her body could be found close to where Rochelle was discovered. \"There can be no certainty in this sort of thing but I would think that is very probable,\" he said. </p> <p>\"If anything crops up and the police need our help, we are ready to go in. We are only minutes away.\" </p> <p>North Yorkshire police and Leeds education authority have both launched investigations into the incident.</p>",
  "Middle East peace was given the slimmest of second chances yesterday after President Bill Clinton browbeat Israel and the Palestinians to agree to end the violence. <p>After 29 hours of exhausting efforts from the high flyers of international diplomacy, yesterday's brief statement, read out by Mr Clinton, is barely a shade better than admitting the summit was an outright failure. </p> <p>But the hollowness of the pledges Mr Clinton obtained from the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to end the violence that has claimed more than 100 lives, was immediately apparent. </p> <p>Within an hour of Mr Clinton's declaration, a gun battle was raging in an outlying suburb of Jerusalem, critically injuring an Israeli border policeman. Last night, the Israeli army threatened to use combat helicopters to attack snipers in the adjacent Palestinian village of Beit Jalla. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the West Bank chieftain of Mr Arafat's Fatah militias, called tanzim in Arabic, said the intifada would continue. </p> <p>With Mr Barak and Mr Arafat refusing to spend time alone in each other's company - let alone sign a ceasefire agreement - yesterday's declaration is the best Mr Clinton could hope for. The two men shook hands for the cameras just once - and at the president's insistence. </p> <p>Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah also balked at giving their official endorsement to end the unrest that has reawakened support for the Palestinian cause in the Arab world and beyond. </p> <p>Lebanon dismissed the summit for failing to resolve fundamental Palestinian problems which sparked fighting. \"We were hoping the meeting would result in an announcement of clear principles to resolve the national issues which caused the Palestinian uprising, including [sovereignty over] Jerusalem, the return of refugees and the Israeli presence on Arab land,\" said the acting prime minister Selim al-Hoss. </p> <p>The spiritual leader of the Islamic militant Hamas group said the agreement insulted Palestinian popular opinion and was not binding on his resistance movement. \"We will continue in resisting the occupation,\" Sheikh Ahmed Yassin told reporters. </p> <p>\"Our meeting has not been easy because the last two weeks have been so hard,\" an ashen-faced Mr Clinton said. \"This tragic and terrible confrontation costing many lives and injuries is threatening everything we have tried to achieve in the past seven years.\" </p> <p>The presidential statement has only three ambitions. The crucial one commits the CIA, Israeli and Palestinian security officials to end the violence, countered by Israeli promises to roll back the tanks from the entrances to West Bank cities, and to lift a closure on Palestinian areas that is akin to sentencing more than 2m people to an open-air prison. </p> <p>It also calls for Mr Arafat and Mr Barak to issue a public call to end the violence. But even before Mr Barak had returned home, a senior official on his aircraft said Israel had given up hope that Mr Arafat would fulfil his pledge to Mr Clinton. However, he said that Israel would be willing to look beyond that lapse, provided violence ceased anyway. </p> <p>In addition, Mr Clinton, and his successor as president, will head an investigation into the violence, perhaps the most contentious areas of dispute. Israel has balked at any suggestion of an international inquiry, for fear of further fuelling widespread international criticism that its army has executed a shoot-to-kill policy against stone-throwing Palestinian youths. </p> <p>Despite Palestinian demands for a full-scale investigation, involving the United Nations and European leaders, the US Secretary General, Kofi Annan, will play only a nominal role in the inquiry. From start to finish, this will be a US enterprise, and unlikely to produce a rigorous investigation, or even to publish its findings. </p> <p>The final pledge is the most surreal, given the atmosphere of recrimination and distrust that now surrounds Israel and the Palestinians, and Mr Barak's plans to form an emergency government with the rightwing Likud party. If it stays quiet for a fortnight, Mr Clinton said, the US will consider reviving the peace process. </p> <p>Desperate to avoid the appearance of failure, Mr Barak pronounced himself satisfied with the results. \"I believe we have achieved the main goal of the summit,\" he told reporters. But even he cautioned: \"The proof of the pudding is in the eating. We have to carry the responsibility together with the Palestinians to put an end to the violence in the region.\" </p> <p>However, Israeli and Palestinian officials both warned that this is an agreement that will be put to the test hour by hour, at several flashpoints for the violent convulsions of the last 19 days. \"We will see if Israel is serious only when it starts implementation,\" said Yasser Abd Rabbo, a senior Palestinian negotiator. </p> <p>Yesterday's agreement is virtually identical to a ceasefire brokered by the US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, in Paris two weeks ago, that collapsed in a matter of hours. Since then, the confrontation has turned cataclysmic, with Israel sending combat helicopters to rocket Mr Arafat's headquarters following the brutal slaying of two reservists by Palestinian mobs. </p> <p>Despite Mr Clinton's arm-twisting, conducted in the spotlight of international diplomacy, the Palestinian leader may find it even harder to rein in the protests now. Yesterday's violence, which erupted in Gaza as well as in the West Bank, was the product of Palestinian anger at his very presence at the summit. </p> <p>Senior Israeli officials said yesterday they were sceptical about achieving a real calm at least until after an Arab summit in Cairo at the weekend, when Mr Arafat is going to seek more active championship of his cause. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "Al Gore and George W Bush said they had no choice but to go ahead with their third and final presidential debate in Missouri last night despite the death of the state governor, a key figure in Mr Gore's Democratic party, in a plane crash on Monday night. <p>Governor Mel Carnahan, who was running for election to the US Senate next month, was killed when a private plane taking him to a fundraising event crashed in poor weather about 30 miles south-west of St Louis, the scene of last night's debate. </p> <p>The crash cast a pall over what was already a tense, high-stakes event in the presidential race. Both candidates agreed to pay tribute at the start of the debate to Carnahan and then go ahead with the debate as scheduled. </p> <p>Carnahan, 66, died in a light-engine Cessna 335 piloted by his son Roger, 44, who also perished. Another passenger, Carnahan's campaign adviser, Chris Sifford, 37, was killed too. </p> <p>Floral tributes were accumulating rapidly outside the governor's mansion in the state capital, Jefferson City, where Carnahan's widow Jean, his high school sweetheart, was being consoled by their three surviving children. Pres ident Clinton called Mrs Carnahan from Egypt to offer his condolences. </p> <p>The death was big news across the US because Carnahan had been involved in a crucial part of the Democratic effort to retake the US Senate. </p> <p>The popular and distinguished two-term governor was engaged in a neck-and-neck battle to unseat Senator John Ashcroft, a strong conservative, on November 7. Missouri is also a key swing state in the Gore-Bush race and one of five top target seats which the Democrats need to win to overturn the Republicans' current 54-46 majority in the Senate. </p> <p>Mr Ashcroft suspended his campaign yesterday, and put all political advertising on hold \"out of respect\". </p> <p>Under Missouri law, however, Carnahan's name must remain on the ballot because the deadline for nominations had closed, raising the macabre possibility that he could yet be elected posthumously. If that happens, and local Democrats will try to ensure it does, Democrat Roger Wilson who was preparing last night to succeed Carnahan as governor, will have the duty of appointing a replacement. </p> <p>Carnahan was one of the most important moderate Democratic politicians in the US. His success in wresting control from the Republicans in the 1992 elections, and then maintaining it, mirrored Bill Clinton's strategy on the national stage. He was due to have attended the debate.</p>",
  "A woman who was born male and became a bride launched a ground-breaking case in the high court yesterday to try to have the marriage recognised as legally valid. <p>Mr Justice Johnson said he was \"sympathetic\" towards Elizabeth Bellinger, 54, who had lived with her husband Michael for 19 years. </p> <p>Their plea was being challenged by the attorney general on the grounds that though the marriage ceremony occurred in front of a registrar, it was not lawful as Mrs Bellinger had never been female. </p> <p>Under English law, a person registered male at birth remains male despite corrective surgery. The couple are challenging the law which allows marriage only between two people whose birth certificates show they are of opposite sex. </p> <p>Ashley Bayston, representing Mrs Bellinger, described her client as \"a male to female post-operative transsexual\" who had always considered herself female. She had been \"forced into marriage\" with a woman and fathered children. She \"broke free\" and lived as a woman from 1971, beginning treatment at Charing Cross hospital, which led to surgery in 1981. She met her future husband in 1980, before surgery to remove her male genitals. </p> <p>The couple married in 1981, without having to show their birth certificates, and Mrs Bellinger brought up her husband's daughter. </p> <p>Ms Bayston said the question for the judge was whether Mrs Bellinger was a female in the eyes of the law and therefore able to marry a man. She asked the court to redefine what was meant by \"man\" and \"woman\" because the law was \"outdated and unreliable\". </p> <p>Mr Justice Johnson spoke of those lumbered with maleness and with a terrible urge to be the opposite sex. \"They are locked up in the wrong body. That seems such a terrible thing to endure...the law seems to be shutting its eyes.\" </p> <p>The hearing, expected to last four days, continues today.</p>",
  "Last Sunday J\u00f6rg Haider's party did surprisingly poorly in regional elections in Styria. Its support dropped to 12.4%, under half of its share of the vote when his Austrian Freedom Party pushed their way to power in Vienna earlier this year. <p>But this setback for the far right followed strong showings in Belgium (33% for Vlaams Blok in Antwerp city elections) and growing public support for the Fremskrittspartiet (Progress party) in Norway. </p> <p>Cool judgment says the far right is not on the march across Europe. Extreme right parties do not exist in, for example, Ireland and Iceland and are irrelevant in Greece and Spain. Even in Germany the Deutsche Volksunion (German People's Union) and Die Republikaner (the Republicans) have never been able to sustain their occasional electoral successes, achieved only at the regional level. The Netherlands and Sweden and now even France have recently seen the far right's implosion. </p> <p>What happened in the 90s was that the extreme right started to diversify. It failed electorally in some countries but in others became strongly established. Far right parties made it into government, first in Italy, where the \"post-fascist\" Alleanza Nazionale (National Alliance) joined the short-lived Berlusconi government in 1994, then in Austria, where Haider's Freiheitliche Partei \u00d6sterreichs teamed up with the conservative People's party. In Germany the far right has terrorist elements which constitute a threat to public order. There are daily attacks on \"undesirables\" (the homeless, foreigners), notably in the regions of the new east. The German government has tried to save its reputation, as well as to ease its increasingly worried business community, by outlawing various small neo-Nazi groups. The Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (National Democratic party of Germany) may also be barred, which would be the first banning of a real political party since the 50s. </p> <p>Germany is not the only European country facing terrorism from the right. Extremists in Sweden, following an American example, have sought to foment racial war. The Vitt Ariskt Motst nd (White Aryan Resistance) has robbed banks, threatened opponents and killed. The Swedish media responded earlier this year by publicly identifying some of its most violent members. </p> <p>Extreme right parties have split internally. Moderates have moved to court mainstream rightwing parties by moderating their rhetoric. This strategy has been most successful for the Alleanza Nazionale in Italy and for Haider: they won the ultimate prize of inclusion in government. But in France, the hardline leader of the Front National, Jean-Marie Le Pen, ousted his moderate vice-chairman, Bruno M\u00e9gret, who is, incidentally, his son-in-law. Within the Vlaams Blok in Belgium, the camps are personified by Filip Dewinter (hardline) and Gerolf Annemans (moderate), which are only kept together by the boycott of the Blok by the mainstream parties. </p> <p>Moderates (these terms are relative) have won votes by toning down the xenophobia and often using neo-liberal rhetoric - for example the Norwegian Progress party, the Italian Lega Nord (Northern League) and Haider. This has distinguished them from extreme right parties which tend to fight on a welfare-chauvinist platform, supporting a welfare state that is only for \"our own people\". But as they have attracted more working-class voters, neo-liberalism has been less in evidence. The ideological mix of such parties as the Norwegian Progress party and the Northern League in Italy is interesting. The League and Haider's Freedom party recently even changed their national allegiance - the League from Italy to \"Padania\" and the Freedom party from Germany to Austria. </p> <p>Despite its diversification and electoral moderation, the extreme right still poses a threat to the democracies of western Europe in general, and to Austria, Belgium and Italy in particular. </p> <p>It is not so much the health of extreme right parties as the feeble state of the mainstream rightwing. Modernised social democratic parties have triumphed in several countries, pushing the \"old right\" out of government and sometimes out of the ideological centre as well. In response, the old right has sought to revamp itself by taking over issues and positions from the extreme right. </p> <p>The Bavarian Christian Social Union's recent campaign in regional elections was almost a copy of earlier Republican campaigns, while much of the UK Tory party's rhetoric on crime and refugees can hardly be distinguished from that of extreme right parties on the continent. There are voices within mainstream rightwing parties calling for a \"normalisation\" of the relationship with the extreme right. The threat has been perceived by governments. The sanctions against Austria agreed by the 14 other member states of the European Union were - it has even been argued - intended as a warning to the mainstream right. </p> <p>But extreme right opinions cannot be wiped out by party bans or sanctions. They have to be addressed at the root, in the reasons why people choose to support the extreme right. The issues driving such support - immigration for example - fully deserve to be put on the political agenda, but not the right's prescriptions. It is up to the mainstream democratic parties to come up with policy solutions to extreme right problems. </p> <p>\u0095 Cas Mudde teaches at Edinburgh University and wrote The Ideology of the Extreme Right, Manchester UP. <a href=\"mailto:c.mudde@ed.ac.uk\">c.mudde@ed.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>By the time specialist drug group <strong> Shire Pharmaceutical </strong> , unveils its third quarter figures in 13 days time there is every chance it will be a FTSE 100 constituent. </p> <p>Following yesterday's promotion of property group <strong> Canary Wharf </strong> , down 31.75p at 527p, to the blue chip index Shire is the biggest company on the FTSE 100 reserve list and the City's favourite to snatch the place being vacated by <strong> Woolwich </strong> , off 2.25p to 369.75p. </p> <p> <strong> Barclays </strong> ,<strong> </strong> down 20p to \u00a317.60p, is due to complete its \u00a35bn acquisition of Woolwich next Tuesday, a process that will free up a FTSE 100 slot the following morning. </p> <p>Index compiler FTSE International is set to replace Woolwich with the company on the reserve list that has the biggest market capitalisation. This figure will be based on Monday night's closing prices and as things stand that company is Shire. </p> <p>Based on last night's closing price of \u00a313.16, down 10p, Shire had a market value of \u00a33.3bn, putting it comfortably ahead of the other candidates, <strong> Psion</strong> (\u00a32.15bn), <strong> Hanson</strong> (\u00a32.4bn), <strong> Rolls-Royce </strong> (\u00a32.7bn) and <strong> AB Foods </strong> (\u00a32.9bn). </p> <p>Dealers expect promotion to be positive for Shire. It will benefit from the kudos of being a blue chip stock and funds that track the FTSE 100 will be forced to buy Shire shares. This should result in Shire's share price being squeezed higher in the coming week. </p> <p>The real test could be whether Shire can retain its place. The next quarterly index reshuffle is due in early December and Shire could fall back. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the three session winning streak of leading shares came shuddering to a halt, unsettled by the sharp decline of telecoms stocks, and speculation that Goldman Sachs was waiting for the right moment to unleash a huge \"sell\" order on to the market. </p> <p>Whether or not Goldman had executed such a trade, dealers said the speculation served to highlight how jittery the market is at the moment. The FTSE 100 ended the day 82.5 points weaker at 6,203.2, while the FTSE 250 fell 43.8 to 6,435.1 and the Techmark slipped 84.81 to 3,362.32. </p> <p>Further evidence of the nervous tone was provided by the performance of <strong> CMG </strong> . The share price of the Anglo-Dutch IT services group plunged 202p, or 15.28%, to \u00a311.20, on rumours the company had been advising analysts that their profits forecasts were too high. In fact, CMG had contacted a number of investment banks to check on the complex models they use to produce their profits forecasts. One, Lehman Brothers, was forced to cut its earning forecast by 2% to incorporate a higher interest charge related to CMG's acquisition of IT consultancy firm Admiral. </p> <p>However, fund managers interpreted this piece of mun dane number crunching as bad news because of its relationship with the Admiral deal - one that was never popular, not least because Admiral had already issued two profits alerts. \"Every investor knows, profit warnings come in threes and investors remain convinced another is on the way\", one dealer said. </p> <p>The rest of the IT service sector suffered, with <strong> Logica </strong> falling 95p to \u00a318.50 and <strong> Sema</strong> surrendering 44p to 925p. </p> <p> <strong> Vodafone</strong> led telecoms stocks lower, diving 10.75p to 252p in the response to Monday's news that the flotation of Verizon Wireless, in which Vodafone holds a 45% stake, had been delayed. Elsewhere, <strong> BT</strong> fell 38.5 to 682p and <strong> Cable &amp; Wireless </strong> lost 32p to 860p </p> <p>Defensive stocks were in demand. Tobacco groups <strong> BAT </strong> and <strong> Imperial Tobacco</strong> rose 18p to 480p and 27p to 695 respectively, while <strong> Scottish &amp; Southern Energy</strong> added 14p to 557p. </p> <p>Lower down the market, software firm <strong> Innovation Group</strong> rose 162.5p to \u00a310.87 on the back on an upbeat trading update and engineering group <strong> Booth Industries</strong> added 4p to 25.5p on news a director had bought 12,500 shares.</p>",
  "Has anyone noticed that the Commons has not met for three months, and does anyone care? Well they should, because this Monday's election of a new Speaker gives the nation a chance to check the stealthy sidelining and downgrading of parliament by an overmighty executive. <p>William Hague noted earlier this year that only in a country with a strong parliament is there genuine representative democracy. Those are the words of the leader of the opposition, but others say the same thing. The former Labour chief whip Derek Foster, speaking in the Commons, said: \"This place must never be the prime minister's poodle. Unfortunately, it has become so.\" </p> <p>Ministers hardly trouble themselves with supporting their own collective business in the most basic way, by voting for it. The chancellor has voted in 18% of divisions; the foreign secretary, more understandably, in 15%; the education secretary in 27%. Even more instructive is to see how often our prime ministers have voted: Harold Wilson in 35% of divisions; Ted Heath in 36%; Jim Callaghan in 38%; Margaret Thatcher in 45%; John Major in 41%. But in the case of Tony Blair, the figure is 5%. If a prime minister and his team care so little for parliament why should anyone else care? </p> <p>The seeming indifference of ministers to the Commons is matched by their persistence in making policy announcements outside parliament. Not long ago a new policy, on-the-spot fines for hooligans, was announced to what one can only assume was a bemused conference of German theologians at T\u00fcbingen. </p> <p>In some departments the interest of parliament is regarded as secondary to media presentation. This spinning is unaccountable and, I believe, self-defeating for it creates cynicism. There is another loss: senior ministers and frontbenchers participating in their department's business are the talent spotters for their successors. Only by taking their Commons business seriously can they understand and assess the qualities of their colleagues and hear how a new generation argues and reasons for the future of our country. </p> <p>The government's changes to the House of Lords have accidentally brought about a significant shift of power from the elected to the unelected chamber. Who would have suspected that the government's deal with Lord Cranborne to half-castrate the legislative powers of hereditary peers would now be revitalising the unelected house into an increasingly formidable debating chamber with more teeth and more clout than the servile Commons? </p> <p> The choice of a new Speaker will help MPs define how we see ourselves. Speakers have great power to influence the regard in which the Commons is held. As the chamber's \"chairmen\" they keep order in our debates, allow or disallow parliamentary questions to ministers, accept or refuse closure motions, select or reject backbench motions or amendments, permit or deny private notice questions or emergency debates, call or not call backbenchers, certify a money bill and rule on matters of privilege. The Speaker has the power to recall par liament in an emergency. To many people it seems a ceremonial job, of wig, breeches and mace, but it is at the heart of our democratic proceedings. As once a Speaker stood up to the demands of Charles I, so a Speaker must be able to stand up to the demands of his successors in Downing Street. </p> <p>A new Speaker should also play his or her part in modernising conditions for those who work in the Commons. Good and able members are seeking to do that as the liaison committee showed in its report, Shifting the Balance. For 17 or 18 weeks a year the house is in recess. Perhaps by surrendering a few of those weeks the question of late-night sittings could be addressed without compromising the proper needs of oppositions and of backbenchers through the imposition of guillotines. </p> <p>Perhaps the Commons could sit a little earlier. I know few who believe that debate late at night or through the night is really appropriate, except in extremis. In this parliament 38 bills have been guillotined, making scrutiny of bills very patchy. The guillotine on the Northern Ireland police powers bill was so unrealistically tight that it denied the house - and in particular elected members from Northern Ireland - the opportunity to debate amendments on its most contentious and central issue, the proposal to change the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. David Trimble was prevented from speaking on third reading. This cannot be right. </p> <p>Reform of hours requires great discipline from government. Too many bills not properly prepared - or, indeed, being written as they go through committee - place a great burden on backbenchers. As always, proper reform should not tilt the balance further towards the executive and away from the house. </p> <p>And we must ensure that the election result has not already been quietly fixed between the whips' offices of the major parties. </p> <p> Richard Shepherd is the Conservative MP for Aldridge Brownhills. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The verdict came swiftly and with characteristic eloquence. The leaders had spent 28 hours arguing, shouting and finally negotiating in Sharm el-Sheikh - but the people they represent took just minutes to deliver their response. As the summit ended, Palestinian militiamen aimed their guns at a Jewish neighbourhood of Jerusalem and Israel responded with tank-mounted machine gun fire. So much for the paper truce, painstakingly pieced together by Bill Clinton and his unique brand of insomnia diplomacy. <p>Not that you can blame the American president. Nor can you point the finger at Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak: they are merely reflecting the mood on the Palestinian and Israeli streets. For both sides in this conflict have returned to the hardest of hard lines. The past two weeks have put them back on a war footing, and they are digging into their trenches. </p> <p>Ordinary Palestinians and Israelis, and their defenders outside the region, are returning to the old, cold positions. The email that has reached me this last week is revealing enough. Advocates for Israel are singing once more the 1970s refrain that the Palestinians already have a home (\"It's called Jordan\") or that the Arabs have 22 other countries to go to, so why must they have poor little Israel too? These are arguments that Israel and Zionism were meant to have abandoned two decades ago. Yet here they go again. </p> <p>The same regression has occurred on the Palestinian side. The email inbox speaks not only of the evils of Israel's post-1967 occupation, or the grotesque record of discrimination inside Israel proper, but of the country's fundamental crime: its mere existence. Longtime rejectionists such as Edward Said are back in business, appearing on Start the Week to call implicitly for the dissolution of the Jewish state - and facing only the slightest challenge. The clear undertow of the phone-in shows and letters pages is the same: not opposed to this border or that settlement, but to the very idea of Israel. As one veteran peace activist told the Guardian this week: \"It's not that they don't want us here as occupiers. They don't want us here at all.\" </p> <p>For those who thought the 1993 handshake between Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin heralded a new dawn, this return to core hostilities is profoundly depressing. The breakthrough of the Oslo accords was to move beyond the absolutist demands of the past - in which each side claimed exclusive right to the land - to a new place, where the two nations finally saw each other. It was that new premise, that both sides had a claim on the same, disputed territory, that underpinned the so-called two-state solution: one for Palestinians, one for Israelis. </p> <p>The trouble, it seems now, is that that logic was never fully accepted by both sides. Palestinians say that Israel never understood it: hence the paltry, pocket Palestine Barak was offering at Camp David. Israelis say Arafat never understood it: hence his regular rhetorical flourishes, in Arabic, hinting at the eventual liquidation of Israel. </p> <p>We are in the realm of retro nationalism, with both Israelis and Palestinians sinking their noses back into history rather than lifting their eyes to the future. But the paradox may be that this could be just what the Israel/Palestine battle needs. Perhaps, if they are ever to have a chance of making peace, both sides need to get to the bottom of their argument once and for all. </p> <p>For Palestinians that means a recognition from Israel that they are a people with national rights. Rabin and Barak both dipped a toe in this water, and Israel's liberal intelligentsia have gone much further. But now Israelis themselves may have to dive in. Yesterday's Ha'aretz newspaper contained an extraordinary essay, all the more remarkable for being published in the current climate. In it sociologist Danny Rabinowitz adds to the current back-to- basics mood by suggesting Israel needs to reflect on its own birth in 1948 - and make amends. He urges his fellow countrymen to acknowledge at last that their state was created at the cost of tragedy and dispossession to another people. He suggests government memorials for the 400 Palestinian villages destroyed in 1948, proper care for ruined mosques and churches, an official memorial day for the Palestinian tragedy - even perhaps a change to Israel's national anthem and flag. What Rabinowitz, in common with Israel's \"new historians\", wants is for the Jewish state finally to see the other side: to recognise the Palestinians' history and understand their claim. </p> <p> I sraelis, of course, want the same thing. Among the ironies of the peace process is that, while one of the great sticking points was always Israeli recognition of a Palestinian state, it is Israel which desperately wants Palestinian recognition - of the Jewish state. It is a constant neurosis of the Israelis that their presence in the Middle East is not accepted as legitimate by their neighbours. They need to hear the Palestinian intelligentsia, if not Arafat himself, at least acknowledge that Israel has a right to exist - yes within smaller borders, yes with an end to occupation and brutality, yes with a policy of internal equality - but a right to exist. </p> <p>Yet such acceptance never comes. Until now, the best Israelis could hope for was a pragmatic recognition by Palestinians that there are 5m Jews in the region and they cannot be wished away. But that grudging, de facto acceptance has not been enough to make Israelis feel secure - and ready to forge a genuine peace with their neighbours. </p> <p>What Israelis, and indeed Jews around the world, need to hear is that Palestinians, and their supporters, recognise that Jews have a right to self-determination like every other people: the Scots, the Catalans, even the Palestinians themselves. Of course the tragic difference is that the territory designated by Jews as the stage for their self-determination already had another people living there. In an ideal world, the Jews would have gone somewhere else. But where? There was no land without a people for \"the people without a land\". </p> <p>Besides, much as the anti-Zionist absolutists refuse to see it, the Jews do have a millennia-old connection to that terrain. No matter what Hanan Ashrawi may say, Jews did not \"fabricate\" Joseph's Tomb. Nor is Haram al-Sharif important only to Muslims: it is also the site of the Jews' Second Temple. It would be easier if the claim was all on one side, as the Palestinian hardliners and Zionist right insist it is. But the truth is not so absolute. </p> <p>So maybe there's hope to be had in this current return to first principles. Maybe, through this argument, those outside the region will see that this is not a Wild West battle of cowboys and Indians, Zionist villains against Palestinian heroes, but a tragedy - pitting against each other two needy peoples, whose causes are both just. When both sides see each other that way, then maybe they will decide to share the land, not only because they have to - but because it is right. </p> <p>Contact: <a href=\"mailto:jonathanfreedland@theguardian.com\">jonathanfreedland@theguardian.com</a>.</p>",
  "A claim that Chinese troops have been making regular forays into Indian territory on the disputed border has thrown relations between the two countries into turmoil. <p>Mukut Mithi, the chief minister of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, said that Chinese army patrols had been crossing mountain terrain there and harassing villagers. </p> <p>The disputed 650-mile border in India's north-east, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), has long been a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers which fought a border war there in 1962. </p> <p>The chief minister claimed that Indian intelligence had uncovered a Chinese-built mule trail on the Kaila pass, in the remote Dibang valley. The trail proved \"repeated\" incursions across the LAC, he said, adding that Chinese troops disguised themselves as hunters and farmers. </p> <p>Unchecked, the incursions would \"snowball into another controversy\", he warned. </p> <p>China claims a large swath of territory in Arunachal Pradesh - which is home to many Buddhist Tibetan tribes - while India maintains that China still holds 40,000 sq km of territory which New Delhi claims in Kashmir. Indian commanders on the border were reported to be refusing to discuss the matter last night. </p> <p>On Monday, China's state media dismissed the reports as \"inaccurate\". An Indian foreign affairs spokesman said he would not confirm or deny the claims, adding that both sides signed agreements to resolve the border issue in 1993 and 1996. </p> <p>Unlike the frontier between India and Pakistan in Kashmir - where rival troops shell each other every day - Indian and Chinese units do not exchange fire. Postmen from both countries even exchange letters for villagers. Suspicions remain, however. </p> <p>The Chinese army last crossed the border in 1986, into the Tawang valley, and built a helipad (later destroyed by India). </p> <p> If superficially polite, relations between New Delhi and Beijing are best characterised as mistrustful. India accuses China of helping Pakistan to stockpile a nuclear and missile arsenal much larger than its own - a claim backed by US intelligence. </p> <p>In 1998, India defended its controversial nuclear tests by pointing to a Chinese nuclear threat. China said India was trying to dominate south Asia.</p>",
  "Anti-government riots swept through Harare yesterday, increasing pressure on President Robert Mugabe who also faces a call for his impeachment in parliament this week. <p>Two military helicopters were deployed as the government tried to contain the riots, which were spreading. They were triggered this week by increases in the price of staple foods and basic transport. </p> <p>\"To hell with Mugabe,\" shouted a tall young man as he threw a rock at a passing police vehicle in the Ardbennie township. \"We don't want to see Mugabe any more.\" </p> <p>Thousands of protesters disrupted business yesterday by putting barricades across main thoroughfares and stoning police vans and other passing vehicles.

No serious casualties were confirmed yesterday, although the capital is awash with rumours of shootings and deaths. </p> <p>The riots, which have so far been concentrated in poor black neighbourhoods, erupted early Monday in the eastern Mabvuku and Tafara townships, where residents protested against higher bus fares and 30% increases in bread and sugar prices in recent days. </p> <p>Yesterday, the demonstrations swept through the rest of the city's teeming townships.

The MDC denies this, but its president, Morgan Tsvangirai, added to the pressure on Mr Mugabe when he said his party would introduce an impeachment motion in parliament this week. </p> <p>With 57 of the parliament's 150 seats, the party can initiate impeachment proceedings. Mr Tsvangirai said the MDC would charge that Mr Mugabe has \"maliciously abused his office and grossly violated the constitution\". He said the riots were not a surprise because \"the anger of the people can only be contained for so long\". </p> <p>At the barricades in Ardbennie, just south of the city centre, Leonard, a young auto electrician, said: \"This government has to go because it has failed to address the bread and butter issues of the people.\" </p> <p>Ministers were \"lining their pockets and driving in luxurious cars. They don't bother to think about the ordinary person who can no longer afford to put basic food on the table. Mugabe says everything is about land. We don't care about land, we care about the economy. We want jobs and we want living standards to stop dropping.\" </p> <p>Some of the most vicious violence was in Mbare township, a kilometre south of the centre of Harare, where swarms of angry rioters indiscriminately pelted passing vehicles with rocks before looting any valuables they found inside. </p> <p>\"All the windows of my car were shattered and the sides are all battered, but I was not injured and I just drove on,\" said Neville James, who was surprised by the violence. </p> <p>\"I am angry and shaken by such senseless violence,\" he said, \"but if this is what it takes to bring a change in the government and more sensible policies, then maybe it is necessary.\"</p>",
  "The lyricist Carl Sigman, who has died aged 91, would have deserved his place in music history for one song alone - Pennsylvania 6-5000. That first hit took its title from the telephone number of New York's Hotel Pennsylvania, and was recorded by Glenn Miller at the end of the 1930s. When it featured in the 1954 film, The Glenn Miller Story, it became a folk memory for a generation that loved seeing James Stewart on the phone to June Allyson. <p>Sigman's All In The Game was a hit twice for Tommy Edwards, in 1951 and 1958, a British success for Cliff Richard in the 1960s, and also for the Four Tops. In 1953, he provided lyrics for Robert Maxwell's Ebb Tide, and, soon afterwards, wrote the \"riding through the glen\" theme for the British television series of Robin Hood. In 1970, Sigman penned the theme song for the film, Love Story. </p> <p>You would have to go back to the days of Johnny Mercer, if not Irving Berlin, to find a writer with a wider range over as long a period. Sigman was a man of many styles, who also managed to coin phrases that became part of everyday language. \"Enjoy Yourself,\" he said in that 1950 song, \"it's later than you think.\" People still say that - even if they have never heard the song - and it served as the message on his own answering machine. </p> <p>Sigman was born into a Jewish-American family in Brooklyn, and studied law at New York University. He practised for a year, but loathed the profession, possibly because court speeches were so formal. He was a spontaneous writer, always striving \"to make conversational lyrics\" from phrases people used on the phone, in the kitchen or across the dinner table. </p> <p>While still an attorney, he worked as a typist and a piano teacher, always trying to find time to go to the Brill Building, \"where all the songwriters hung out\". His other successes included The All-American Soldier, which became the official, second world war song of the US 82nd Airborne Division. Sigman earned a $25 war bond for his trouble - having already won a bronze star as a member of an army glider crew in Europe. </p> <p>For the 1947 Broadway musical, Angel In The Wings, he produced Bongo, Bongo, Bongo, also known as Civilisation, a huge hit for Danny Kaye and the Andrews Sisters, as well as for Louis Prima. It was while listening to Prima cutting that disc that he met his future wife, Terry, then working for the singer and bandleader. </p> <p>Sigman occasionally wrote his own music, frequently adapting foreign songs. He did not, however, translate the lyrics, because he thought \"the accents and metre are different\". Among the adaptations was the French ballad Et Maintenant, which became the mid-1960s Frank Sinatra and Shirley Bassey hit What Now, My Love. </p> <p>Several of Sigman's themes, not originally written for screen, surfaced frequently on film. It's All In The Game featured in the 1982 movie Diner, in Losin' It (1983) and in October Sky (1999). </p> <p>He is survived by his wife and three sons. </p> <p>Carl Sigman, songwriter, born 1909; died September 26 2000</p>",
  "John Laredo, who has died unexpectedly in Leeds aged 68, was one of a distinguished band of Afrikaner intellectuals, including Bram Fischer, Breyten Breyteinbach and Marius Schoon, whose rebellion against the white supremacist doctrines of apartheid led to their imprisonment. <p>After the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, and the ensuing repression, armed struggle seemed to many radicals an inevitability. The African Resistance Movement, formed by a mixture of liberals and socialists, undertook numerous acts of sabotage from December 1961 to mid-1964, when the special branch broke the organisation and imprisoned a score of people, most of them young and white. </p> <p>That Laredo, then head of social anthropology at Rhodes University, Port Elizabeth - and a naturally gentle, easygoing and law-abiding man - should have joined such a group can best be explained by his instinctive egalitarianism and loathing of injustice. These were qualities recognised by his pro-regime mother, who said to him during a prison visit: \"I cannot agree with your actions, but the Haaroffs [her maiden name] were always rebels and I know you've done what you believe to be right.\" </p> <p>Detained and interrogated for 110 days, under the \"90-day\" detention clause, Laredo was jailed for five years after refusing to give evidence against his comrades. In the notorious Pretoria local prison, he was a resolute and and cheerful companion. His ability to find common ground was crucial in furthering solidarity between communists and non-communists. </p> <p>Laredo was born in Pretoria. His mother was related to a former president of the Free State Republic and his father was a civil servant. His home language was Afrikaans, but he spoke English impeccably - possibly because his mother had insisted, \"If you must speak the enemy's language, be sure to speak it better than they do\". He later learned Zulu and several other European languages. </p> <p>In 1951, Laredo went to Stellenbosch University, that incubator of so many Afrikaner nationalist theorists. Ironically, while majoring in history and native administration, he began to analyse the factors causing black poverty and subjugation - and concluded that white hegemony was to blame. Reading for a master's in social anthropology at King's College, Cambridge, between 1955 and 1957, completed his conversion to socialism. </p> <p>While in Britain, Laredo married Ursula Marx, another brilliant Stellenbosch graduate, returning in 1958 to South Africa, where their daughter and two sons were born. After lecturing in African studies at Cape Town University, he moved to Durban in 1959 to undertake anthropological fieldwork in kwaZulu at Natal University, where he subsequently became a sociology lecturer. In Natal, the Laredos joined Alan Paton's Liberal party and participated in peaceful demonstrations and anti-apartheid teach-ins. </p> <p>Their home became an informal locus where young South Africans - whatever their colour - could talk politics. On one legendary occasion, a somewhat xenophobic Laredo aunt arrived unexpectedly in the middle of a debate. Offered a chair by a black man, she vigorously dusted it with her handkerchief before sitting down. </p> <p>In 1963, John took charge of social anthropology at Rhodes, while continuing his fieldwork. This should have led to a distinguished PhD and a secure place in the academic community, had the secret police not intervened. </p> <p>After his release from prison, with his career shattered by banning orders and house arrest, Laredo came into exile in Britain. From 1970-71, he was resident visiting fellow at his old Cambridge college. He then joined the new Bradford University's sociology department, until a heart attack in 1990, and further illnesses, prompted him to retire in 1993. </p> <p>Through good health and bad, Laredo worked tirelessly for various causes, including the Labour party and the Anti-Apartheid Movement, of which he was secretary through the 1980s. His marriage had broken down in 1972 but, characteristically, the couple achieved an amicable divorce, and, in 1986, John met Ailsa Swarbrick, an Open University lecturer, with whom he enjoyed great domestic happiness until the end. </p> <p>Together, they celebrated the collapse of apartheid, after which they were finally able to visit South Africa. It was the only reward he wanted. </p> <p>John Epaninondas Laredo, academic and anti-apartheid activist, born February 13 1932; died October 1 2000</p>",
  "Politicians from all sides have been discussing the new crime figures this week and the statistics make depressing reading. When talking about action against burglars, use of the word \"tough\" has increased 57%. When referring to violent crime, the incidence of politicians saying \"tough\" has gone up by a massive 71%. We are more likely to be assaulted by the phrase \"more bobbies on the beat\" than at any time in the past 20 years and millions now live in fear of the trauma of waking up to discover that Jack Straw is talking on the Today programme. <p>Meanwhile the British Crime Survey has actually revealed that crime itself is going down. There are fewer burglaries, except in the areas where people keep leaving the house to attend Neighbourhood Watch meetings. There is a reduction in motor vehicle crime which is attributed to car alarms, while the increase in parked cars being attacked with a sledgehammer in the middle of the night is also attributed to car alarms. Apparently we are more likely to be robbed and assaulted by strangers, but this is hardly surprising - if you are going to mug someone you would have to be pretty stupid to try it out on your best friend. </p> <p>Ann Widdecombe will be disappointed that the crime figures have fallen, despite all the efforts of her Conservative colleagues in getting themselves arrested on a regular basis. One of the few perks of being shadow home secretary is being able to point to the inexorable rise in recorded offences and using this to attack your opponent. But now, as she peeks out from behind her net curtains, she will realise that she too has been the victim of a crime. When it comes to the law and order issue, Labour have stolen the Tories' clothes (although the image of Jack Straw in one of Ann Widdecombe's dresses is not something you'd want to dwell upon). </p> <p> While Ann's own pronouncements are greeted with stoned giggles from her colleagues in the shadow cabinet, Labour can point to solid social and economic policies that have helped bring crime down. The massive reduction of youth unemployment, for example, must surely be a factor; quite how the Tories imagine that scrapping the new deal and the minimum wage would help reduce youth crime has not been explained. Maybe Ann had an explanation for this but it was nicked from her briefcase. </p> <p>Although the figures are falling, a huge percentage of crime continues to be committed by young males. There is a simple way of rectifying this imbalance: the government should introduce lots of new offences for everyone else. All sorts of anti-social behaviour continues to go unchecked in our society. For example, if you are in a long queue it should be unlawful for the person right in front of you suddenly to be joined by lots of friends. If you arrive in the cinema after the film has started, it should be an offence not to duck slightly as you walk across the front. If the film ends five minutes before last orders it should also be against the law to sit there in deep contemplation, waiting to see who was \"Key Grip\" while everyone else on your row has stood up and is desperate to get out and grab a swift pint. </p> <p>Leaving the scene of a jammed photocopier should be a criminal offence. And a new charge of digital fraud should be used to target the makers of PCs that brazenly lie at you. \"Your printer is not connected.\" \"Yes it bloody is!\" There should also be a new offence of corporate stalking. I have been stalked by British Telecom for several years now. They keep sending me letters and ringing me up when I least expect it, saying they know who my friends and family are, and then offering to change them for me. </p> <p>Of course it could be argued that we don't need any new offences when there are so many crimes that are ignored already. None of the reporting on this week's crime figures made any reference to City fraud or big business tax evasion. Where are the interviews with old ladies saying how they are afraid to go out lest they should be offered a tip for some insider trading? Where are the big yellow signs in the City of London saying \"Appeal for Witnesses - Fraud. Did you see anyone skimming the remainders fund, selling currency forward and then buying it spot fixed overnight? And more to the point, can you explain what this means?\" </p> <p>There are all sorts of reasons why crime has fallen and many voters will be alienated by anyone trying to score party political points on this issue. But before the election Tony Blair promised to be \"tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime\", and the latest crime figures suggest his approach is clearly working. Okay, so he nicked the phrase from Gordon. But you can't blame Labour for that; the Tories were in power when it happened. </p> <p>John O'Farrell's novel, The Best a Man Can Get, is published by Doubleday. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>Useful links: <br><a href=\" http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/bcs1.html\" target=\"_new\">British crime survey</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crimprev/cpindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Home Office crime reduction site</a></p>",
  "<p>More than 350 people have died in Vietnam's worst floods for 70 years. Most of the victims are young children who drowned while left unattended by their parents. </p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of people in the Mekong delta in southern Vietnam have been forced to flee their homes, and water levels are so high that they will not be able to return until December. </p> <p>Last week the floodwaters receded for the first time since July. But a new wave of sustained, heavy rain has pushed levels back up again to the point where the country's commercial capital, Ho Chi Minh City, could find itself inundated. \"The flood is now reaching provinces where people are not used to seeing something on this scale,\" said Peter Michelson who is coordinating the Red Cross's relief effort in the delta. </p> <p>Those whose homes have been submerged are living on small, muddy dykes in squalid, unhygienic conditions. Many have run out of food and rely on relief workers to bring in supplies. </p> <p>Hunger and disease are not the only dangers. A number of crocodiles - not normally seen in the Mekong delta - have appeared in the floodwaters. It is believed that they were washed downstream from Cambodia or escaped from crocodile farms in Vietnam. </p> <p>There is also a plague of golden snails which are breeding rapidly in the flood water. Farmers have reported seeing millions of snails' eggs. It is feared the snails will eat any rice crops that survive the flood. In the past the authorities have had to organise communal, mass culls of the snails to protect agricultural land. </p> <p>Every year floods in the south cause disruption, but this time things are far worse. And in central Vietnam heavy monsoon rains have caused devastating floods for the last three years. So far this month, more than 50 people have died in flash floods well away from the Mekong. Some environmentalists believe east Asia's weather patterns are becoming increasingly extreme and dangerous. </p> <p>\"There's a lot more rain falling in less time. Overall the amount of rainfall isn't changing but it's coming down in very intense short bursts,\" said the UN's environment adviser in Hanoi, Craig Leisher. </p> <p>But the problem is also manmade. The Mekong river starts in China and flows through Laos, Thailand and Cambodia before reaching southern Vietnam. All along its course, forests are being cut down, reducing the land's capacity to retain water. Downstream, the people of the delta are on the receiving end of the more extreme floods that result. </p> <p>The Vietnamese authorities have tried to clamp down on illegal logging but with limited success. \"Some cases have gone to court. Even so, deforestation has still happened. Some poor people still cut down trees. They need the money to make a living,\" said Nguyen Tuy Nien, director of flood control and dyke management. </p> <p>Local newspapers have reported that there have been more than 39,000 violations of forestry regulations so far this year. Illegal loggers are turning violent when challenged by forest rangers. </p> <p>Other modern practices, such as creating concrete river banks so buildings can be put up near the Mekong, contribute to the volume of water arriving downstream. And it is feared that increased damming of the river - especially in China and Laos - could compound the problem. When reservoirs fill up, dam managers release vast amounts of water, adding to the difficulties downstream. </p> <p>The Vietnamese government says it wants people to live with floods rather than escape them. In recent years the authorities have extended small loans so families can build their houses on stilts. Thousands of wooden boats have been distributed so that flood victims can fish for their own food rather than rely on aid agencies. Effective early warning systems have been installed; without them many more people would have died. </p> <p>But such initiatives cannot hide the fact that the number of people vulnerable to flooding is increasing. \"More and more people are living in the delta, closer to the banks,\" said Koos Neefjes of Oxfam. \"These very poor people need to fish; they need to live on the river banks.\" </p> <p>Vietnam is one of the most densely populated countries in Asia. By implementing a policy of trying to limit children to two per family, the government is said now to have largely controlled population growth. That will ease the situation in the future but for the present, there is still great pressure on marginal land as people try to find somewhere to make a living. </p> <p>The increasing numbers in the Mekong delta have resulted in new agricultural practices. The type of rice, for example, traditionally grown there can withstand most floods because it floats. But popular new strains, while more productive, cannot survive a long flood and much of this year's crop has been lost.</p>",
  "<p>No sound on the film festival circuit is as haunting as the clatter of seats flipping up as person after person walks out of a screening. I've never heard it come as thick and fast as in Cannes in 1998, when they showed the Russian film Khroustaliov, My Car! </p> <p>By all accounts, Alexei Guerman's film didn't fare well in Russia either, but the film arrives here this week, via Paris and New York, where it won a reputation as a misunderstood masterpiece. Misunderstood, or just incomprehensible? There is, apparently, a coherent plot buried beneath the manic activity. </p> <p>The film is set in Moscow in 1953, against the background of the so-called Doctors' Plot - an anti-semitic operation that spread the rumour that Jewish doctors were conspiring to poison the Soviet high command. The hulking baldie Yuri Glinsky, a Red Army general and brain surgeon whose chaotic household shelters two Jewish nieces is caught up in the scandal. He ends up witnessing Stalin's gruesome demise, which is where the title is explained (Khroustaliov was chauffeur to Beria, chief of the secret police). </p> <p>What makes Khroustaliov such a head-spinner is the frenzied style. Guerman favours long takes and labyrinthine tracking shots but everything is an orchestrated cataclysm, like a hellish circus. Few of the thousands of characters stay still long enough to be identified. The film is a succession of chases, pratfalls and punch-ups; characters mutter to themselves or burst into song or screams; dogs, pigs, lions drown out the dialogue. </p> <p>Russian cinema has its tradition of period reconstruction, but nothing quite like this. Guerman's previous film My Friend Ivan Lapshin (1982) was set just before the Stalinist purges of the 1930s. Its follow-up is a very personal project: Guerman has compared General Glinsky to his own father, a prominent Soviet writer. He actually began work on the film in the last days of the Soviet Union, but the production stretched over seven years, with funds continually running out and a year reputedly spent assembling the many ominous black cars that drive around Moscow in the film's night scenes. </p> <p>It is a wonder the film was ever completed. It has been called impenetrable but it has its spaces and silence too - and the very first shot, as a dog chases a motorcycle down a snow-covered boulevard at night, is one of the most haunting images of recent cinema. Khroustaliov, My Car! resembles nothing else in cinema - although if Fellini, Tarkovsky and Tati had pooled resources to update a Gogol story, they might have matched it. </p> <p>Of Freaks and Men, Alexei Balabanov's black comedy of fin de si\u00e8cle porn in St Petersburg, was recently a cult hit here, which proves that British audiences are ready for the darker end of the Russian cinematic imagination. Guerman's film, however, may be Russian cinema's answer to Finnegans Wake. This month's screenings, courtesy of the micro-distributor Kino Kino!, could be the only chance you get to see it. And don't worry about the sound of the seats flipping - it all blends in marvellously with the cacophony.</p> <p>Khoustaliov, My Car! is at the Cin\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re, London SW7 (020-7838 2144) , on Thursday; at the ICA, London SW1 (020-7930 3647), on Monday; and at the Filmhouse, Edinburgh (0131-228 2688), on October 30.</p>",
  "<p>BMW, the former owners of Rover, yesterday dealt the new management of the British car firm a damaging double blow by rejecting their plea for further funding and dashing their hopes of a quick purchase of the engine plant at Longbridge. </p> <p>Directors of the company, now called MG Rover, have been negotiating for a further \u00a3150m from BMW to offset the fall in the value of the stock of vehicles acquired at the time of the merger. They were also hoping to wrap up a deal to buy the engine plant by mid December. </p> <p>Werner S\u00e4mann, head of BMW's UK operations, said in Birmingham that the German group saw no need to hand over any more money to MG Rover and that it was negotiating with a number of international companies over the Longbridge engine plant. </p> <p>The Phoenix consortium headed by John Towers bought the bulk of Rover Cars from BMW for a nominal \u00a310 in May. But it also received a \"dowry\" from the German firm estimated at about \u00a3500m. </p> <p>Negotiations have been going on for some months to finalise the accounts on the deal, known as a completion agreement. Since the initial takeover deal was struck, car values in Britain have fallen sharply, prompting MG Rover to seek up to \u00a3150m more. </p> <p>Senior MG Rover directors said on Monday that they hoped to reach a final agreement with BMW before Christmas. But Prof S\u00e4mann said yesterday: \"We signed an agreement on May 9, transferring all the assets and liabilities to Phoenix based on their valuation on that date. </p> <p>\"There is no need to sign off any completion accounts. We have handed over the balance sheet and the business and that is it. If they have a problem with that, they can go to arbitration.\" </p> <p>Prof S\u00e4mann's aides recognised, however, that it was in the interests of both groups to come to a swift resolution of their differences. But they saw no need for a hasty decision on the Longbridge engine, gearbox and foundry plant which provides all of MG Rover's power units. </p> <p>Rob Oldaker, MG Rover's product design director, made plain on Monday that gaining control of the Longbridge engine facility - known as Powertrain - was critical to plans to develop a new range of sporty vehicles under the MG badge and to speed the company's return to profit by 2002 by cutting costs. </p> <p>He said: \"We are confident we will come to a successful outcome. We can do lots of things with this facility.\" The Longbridge engine plant delivers 70% of its annual output of about 200,000 units to MG Rover and the rest to Land Rover, now owned by Ford. </p> <p>But Prof S\u00e4mann said reports that a deal would be concluded by Christmas were wide of the mark. \"There are several renowned international companies who are interested in the business and with whom we are negotiating. Phoenix is just one of them.\" </p> <p>BMW officials said the German group was negotiating with \"less than a handful\" of would-be buyers and did not expect a result for several months. </p> <p>Ford, which is not interested in buying the plant, is thought to be reluctant to see it pass into MG Rover's hands.</p>",
  "<p>Phil Davis has a great grin. It is truly wolfish, utterly evocative of a cute animal having been recently devoured. He uses it to great effect when playing scheming barrister's clerk Peter McLeish in Channel 4's big new legal drama North Square. And it creeps onto his face when I ask him if he has ever been arrested. </p> <p>\"No. Everybody asks me this. It's really interesting, that's the one question everyone has asked me. But it is true to say that whenever I've been in a legal drama before, I have always been in the dock.\" </p> <p>It's the work rather than the life: Davis has played his share of dangerous geezers. He starred in the definitive account of football thuggery (The Firm) and directed another (ID). Not to mention all the times he has appeared alongside Ray Winstone: in Face and in Births, Marriages And Deaths, just for starters. In real life, as the clean record suggests, the bespectacled Davis is both thoughtful and affable. But his acting has that edge, and it makes McLeish a memorable character. North Square, written by ex-barrister Peter Moffat, makes the useful choice of showing the chief clerk, rather than the head of chambers, as the person in control. </p> <p>\"I was surprised that barristers' clerks wielded so much power and influence\", Davis admits. \"I had no idea, I just thought they were administrative.\" Bobbing round the 47-year-old Davis as the barrister in the upstart Leeds chamber is a cast of (mostly) highly photogenic, posher actors fifteen to twenty years his junior, including Helen McCory, Kevin McKidd and Rupert Penry-Jones. But the camera keeps coming back to Davis, as he insists on calling all the barristers \"sir\" or \"miss\" while telling them exactly what to do. You don't need to be watching long to see that Davis is enjoying himself. \"He's a fantastic character: vivid and well-drawn and appalling and funny. One would be foolish not to relish that.\" </p> <p>On these pages, Mark Lawson has suggested that North Square is unduly concerned with class. Davis, unsurprisingly, doesn't agree. \"It's only a shock to middle-class people that there is this working-class guy running things for all these middle- class, intelligent barristers. You could say that all English drama is about class to some degree, but I don't think North Square is about class predominantly: it's about law, and how it is applied. That's what is really interesting: in one scenario a woman loses her children and it's tragic, in another some nutter is stealing underpants and it's comic; that's much more like real life, with a tragedy tumbling over a comedy. Plus the career side of it: you're hoping for a plea on Monday so you can do the big fraud on Tuesday. Of course it goes on.\" </p> <p>This is hardly the first time Davis has talked about class. Having appeared in The Who's mod melodrama Quadrophenia and worked with Alan Clarke on The Firm, he is part of the Ray Winstone/Phil Daniels generation of working-class actors so neglected during the 80s. He comes from that part of Essex that absorbed the London overspill, and his dad worked in a soap factory. </p> <p>\"I always wanted to be an actor, and I was indulged by my parents. I joined the National Youth Theatre, and didn't distinguish myself. I was shy, and squeaky, and about three foot six. I left school, and I was working in coffee bars and all that, and I wrote to Joan Littlewood at Stratford East. They were starting a new season, and I auditioned, and I got the job, and stayed for a year. Then I was off and running. I didn't go to drama school, and it was a real advantage working with her not hav ing trained, because Joan Littlewood worked in such a weird way - I would've had to unlearn everything immediately. It was a good start, it made me pragmatic.\" </p> <p>Along with Littlewood, Davis's other mentor was Mike Leigh. He worked with Leigh in the theatre, and as Cyril the bearded bike courier in High Hopes. \"It was like a workshop on how to make a story. And Mike was very supportive when I started writing. He'd always come and see a rehearsal and tell me very frankly exactly what he thought I ought to do.\" Davis has directed two films (ID and last year's Hold Back The Night), plus TV shows including Prime Suspect and Real Women. He says it has refreshed him as an actor, but he doesn't make it sound much fun. </p> <p>\"Directing isn't terribly enjoyable, and for me going to do an acting job after that is the life of Riley. For me, acting isn't an intellectual exercise, it's purely instinctive. When it's great, it's like surfing. Whereas directing, you have to contain a kind of algebra in your head.\" </p> <p>He lives in Hackney these days and still supports West Ham, but not rabidly. And on the subject of football, he's aware that the first episode of North Square is up against Manchester United vs PSV. \"I can't help thinking if I was launching a ten-episode, brand new series, I wouldn't put it up against the football on ITV.\" </p> <p>He's right, of course, but if you really can't miss the dreaded Reds playing, then tape North Square. The first episode tries a little too hard (what's with all the Clash references?), but it gets better. And Peter McLeish could turn out to be a great character. </p> <p>Watch for that grin. </p> <p>\u0095 North Square, 9pm, Channel 4.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers pushing the case for radical reform of town and county halls think their campaign to create a network of elected executive mayors in England after the next general election is finally paying off. With some 14 councils, led by Birmingham, preparing to hold mayoral referendums - and a string of others poised to join them - all the signs now point to a \"national democracy day\" in 12 months' time. </p> <p>The idea is to co-ordinate up to 30 mayoral referendums next October to test popular support for an elected first citizen - with full-blown mayoral polls coinciding with local elections in May 2002. </p> <p>This comes as key members of the New Local Government Network, a pressure group close to Downing Street, publish the results of a lengthy research project which urges the government to be far bolder in giving councils more powers and responsibilities - and argues that policies imposed from the top without local support often fail. Significantly some of the findings of the project, Towards a New Localism, which will be discussed at a conference in London tomorrow, follow the Guardian's own agenda for local democracy, published last month in its alternative election manifesto. </p> <p>The network says that the mayoral debate should light the spark for a much wider reform process, with councils developing into the champions of their areas by assuming a wider leadership role embracing the economic and social health of communities. It attacks the excessive centralism of Whitehall and calls for a new system of five-year \"partnership compacts\", drawn up between town halls and all local stakeholders, which would replace the panoply of government-inspired programmes. Councils selected for such compacts would get extra government cash and support. </p> <p>With the network influential in parts of the government, the reaction of ministers so far has been interesting. Perhaps with an eye on the project, local government minister, Hilary Armstrong, has urged authorities to become more adventurous. \"Councils don't need to wait for a lead from central government before testing new ideas,\" she last week told the annual conference of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives. \"I'd be very pleased to see more evidence of councils making the running with their own reform agenda.\" </p> <p>Armstrong finally pushed through legislation paving the way for mayors and cabinet-style administrations three months ago, with her boss at the environment department, John Prescott, publicly expressing opposition to the concept. </p> <p>Nevertheless, with Birmingham now on track to lead the field, it is likely that other big cities will join small authorities - such as Berwick-upon-Tweed, and several London boroughs - in quickening the pace for change. Birmingham's support rested on a knife edge. But the council's Labour leader, Albert Bore and his deputy, Andy Howell, have narrowly retained their positions after beating off opposition in the city's divided Labour group.</p>",
  "<p>Steve Claridge's good luck story continued last night when, for his second match in charge as player-manager, he again scored the winning goal. </p> <p>He followed up Saturday's winner against Sheffield Wednesday with an 81st-minute penalty against Crewe and awarded for a dubious foul on Justin Edinburgh. </p> <p>Claridge had to bring in Michael Panopoulos after Steve Harper went down with a calf-muscle injury in the warm-up, and the player-manager's eventful evening continued when the referee ordered him to pull up his socks after a free-kick had been awarded against him. Indeed the Lewes official Steve Tomlin refused to allow play to continue until he conformed. </p> <p>To round off an otherwise unspectacular first half the player-manager earned himself a yellow card in the 41st minute for dissent, disputing a free-kick awarded against him for a foul. </p> <p>Almost inevitably he was involved in the best chance of the half, too, a superb piece of control with his back to goal setting up Thomas Thogersen, who dragged his low shot across the face of goal. </p> <p>The match sprung to life in the second half with a penalty award and then a sending off after Pompey had plugged away without reward for an hour. Scott Hiley brought down Mark Rivers inside the area and Shaun Smith stepped up to convert the spot-kick. </p> <p>But Crewe's lead was put in jeopardy two minutes later when Paul Tait was sent off for a second bookable offence; on each occasion he had barged into the home goalkeeper. The hosts took advantage almost immediately, Thogersen scoring with a low shot from 15 yards five minutes later. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
