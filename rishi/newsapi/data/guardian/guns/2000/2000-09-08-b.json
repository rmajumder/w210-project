  "With the Sydney games just a week away, the International Olympic Committee was yesterday condemned for failing to combat the use of performance-enhancing drugs which a report says are more widespread than ever. <p>In the study, Winning at Any Cost: Doping in Olympic Sports, the IOC is portrayed as a major part of the problem rather than part of the solution. </p> <p>The 107-page report, commissioned by the US drug czar's policy office and financed by the White House, said the Olympic governing body faced an inherent conflict of interest in its need to attract sponsorship and the consequent desire to avoid the sort of bad publicity created by unmasking cheats. </p> <p>\"Persistent patterns of irregularities in enforcement raises serious doubts about the commitment of the sports' governing bodies to protect the interest of honest athletes, the virtues of the sport and the health and safety of the competitors,\" the report said. </p> <p>It added: \"For sports governing bodies, tacit approval of performance-enhancing drugs places their credibility in jeopardy.\" </p> <p>According to athletes and trainers interviewed by the US national commission on sports and substance abuse, drug use has become almost the norm in some sports, while scientists said attempts to develop new tests \"were stymied by... a seeming lack of will at the highest levels of the IOC\". </p> <p>The critical assessment con flicted sharply with IOC claims that it is getting to grips with the problem. It had trumpeted the approval last week of a new test for the drug EPO, which increases the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. The test contributed this week to the removal of 27 athletes from the Chinese Olympic team. </p> <p>An IOC spokesman, Franklin Servan-Schreiber, said: \"I'm not saying we've won the war on drugs, but we're close to winning the war on EPO and we've put a fear in people who are cheating.\" </p> <p>Critics remain unconvinced. Charles Yesalis, the author of a book on performance-enhancing drugs, has dismissed the EPO test as a public relations move. \"These games are going to be as drug-laden as the rest.\" </p> <p>Even if the new EPO test proves effective in catching or deterring users, there is still no method for detecting two other widely abused prohibited drugs, human growth hormone [HGH] and insulin growth factor [IGF-1]. </p> <p>The level of drug penetration in certain disciplines suggested by the report have surprised few involved in the Olympics. Mark Spitz, winner of a record seven Olympic swimming gold medals in 1972, accused the authorities of \"pulling the wool over everybody's eyes\". </p> <p>\"There is tremendous pressure from the television networks and also from the nations that know their athletes wouldn't pass those tests,\" Spitz said. </p> <p>\"They want the television to have athletic competitions with the world record holders there for the finals. It's all about ratings and commercial selling of time and about money. There is a tremendous conflict of interest in what they should do and what they are doing.\" </p> <p>\"I can't believe they've done nothing,\" said Daley Thompson, Britain's 1980 and 1984 Olympic decathlon champion. \"With all the money pouring into sport you would have thought the one thing they would have done was to stamp out drugs.\" </p> <p>The US drug czar, General Barry McCaffrey, said the report demonstrated the need for an independent international body to police the use of drugs. The report noted that the world anti-doping agency created by the IOC last year was under IOC control and only had the power to make recommendations. </p> <p>The report suggests the creation of an agency which does not have to answer to the IOC, coupled with an international research effort of up to $100m over five years to devise new, more comprehensive tests. </p> <p>It also suggested the introduction of athletic \"passports\" which would record each athlete's history of doping tests. There would also be standardised lists of banned substances and a uniform tariff of penalties associated with them. </p> <p>\"When the games begin in Sydney, millions of children will be watching,\" Gen McCaffrey said. \"They'll copy the moves of the basketball players and the strokes of the swimmers. Unless we continue to rid the games of doping and drugs, these children will take the same drugs as they see their stars cheating with.\"</p>",
  "The United Nations force commander in Sierra Leone has accused Nigerian political and military officials at the top of the UN mission in Freetown of \"working hard to sabotage the peace process\", and the Nigerian army command of looting diamonds in league with the now imprisoned rebel leader, Foday Sankoh. <p>In a devastating four-page confidential report obtained by the Guardian, Major-General Vijay Jetley paints a picture of a conspiracy to force him out as the UN commander in Sierra Leone. </p> <p>The public airing of bitter differences within the UN operation in Freetown comes at a particularly sensitive time as world leaders pledge to overhaul peacekeeping in Africa after a decade of humiliating failures in Angola, Somalia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. With 7,000 more UN troops destined for Freetown, Gen Jetley's report will force the Security Council to confront issues beyond the numbers of peacekeepers and their mandate, and to consider whether the whole operation is a further threat to stability in west Africa. </p> <p>The memorandum, called Report on the crisis in Sierra Leone, was written during the upheaval in May that prompted British intervention to prevent the rebel Revolutionary United Front from seizing power. Gen Jetley never officially submitted the document to the UN but it has been widely circulated among members of the Security Council and other major players in Sierra Leone. Its damning criticism of the Nigerians, and its exposure of the deep divisions that have all but paralysed the UN mission, has added pressure for a major shakeup of a discredited peacekeeping force that Britain is counting on to play a leading role in the defeat of the RUF. </p> <p>Gen Jetley singles out three Nigerians for particular criticism: Kofi Annan's special representative in Freetown, under-secretary-general Oluyemi Adeniji; the former head of Ecomog, the west African intervention force in Sierra Leone which worked with the UN for six months, Major General Gabriel Kpamber; and the deputy force commander, Brigadier-General Mohammed Garba, who is Gen Jetley's immediate subordinate. The report lays bare the personal animosity between Gen Jetley and the men he accuses, but it goes further by detailing a series of actions that he says amount to collusion with the rebels to wreck last year's peace accords because Nigeria wants a free hand to run Sierra Leone and its army wants to control the diamond trade. At the heart of the accusations lie charges that the Nigerians compromised Gen Jetley's efforts to free 500 of his peacekeepers taken hostage by the RUF in May. </p> <p>\"The mission directive given to me and which I tried to follow implicitly, directly conflicted with the interests of not only the warring factions but also of the major players in the diamond racket like Liberia and Nigeria. </p> <p>\"As an Indian, and having no hidden agenda to promote, I became a victim of the machinations of these countries. By placing their stooges in the right places they have not only tried to scuttle the peace process but also try and denigrate me and the country I represent, to promote their own personal ambitions and personal interests. </p> <p>\"It is my opinion that the Ecomog force commander along with the SRSG [Mr Adeniji] and DFC [Gen Garba] have worked hard to sabotage the peace process and show Indians in general and me in particular in a poor light... Keeping the Nigerian interests was paramount even if it meant scuttling the peace process and this also implied that Unamsil [the UN force] was expendable. </p> <p>\"To this end the SRSG and DFC cultivated the RUF leadership especially Foday Sankoh behind my back.\" </p> <p>But the report came as no surprise to western and senior UN officials who say that there is ample evidence that the Nigerian army remains heavily implicated in the illegal diamond trade, that its senior officers worked closely with the RUF despite having also fought it, and that the Nigerians believe that, as the largest troop contingent in the UN mission, they should have overall command. </p> <p>Gen Jetley argues that senior Nigerian army officers - particularly Gen Kpamber and Brigadier-General Maxwell Khobe, who died earlier this year - did not want to withdraw from Sierra Leone because they were making huge amounts of money from illegal diamond mining and payments from the RUF. </p> <p>\"It is well known that public opinion in Nigeria was against the continued deployment of Nigerian troops as part of Ecomog in Sierra Leone, however the Nigerian army was interested in staying in Sierra Leone due to the benefits they were getting from the illegal mining. Gen Khobe was known as the 'Ten Million man', it is alleged that he received up to $10m to permit the activities of RUF. The Ecomog force commander Gen Kpamber was also involved in the illegal diamond mining in connivance with RUF leader Foday Sankoh,\" Gen Jetley wrote. </p> <p>In January, Gen Kpamber astonished a meeting of regional heads of state on the peace process by praising Mr Sankoh as the \"saviour of the nation\". The two men were often seen in each other's company travelling to diamond towns from which the UN was barred. Sierra Leoneans referred to Gen Kpamber as \"Sankoh's ADC\". </p> <p>Gen Jetley lists a series of actions by the Nigerian army which he concludes amounted to colluding in the abductions. He notes that while Kenyans, Zambians and Indians were taken captive, the rebels let the Nigerians go. </p> <p>But the alleged relationship between Mr Sankoh and senior Nigerian officers and officials would explain why the rebel leader was trying to get to the Nigerian High Commission when he was captured. Gen Jetley blames low morale for the mass surrender of his troops.</p>",

  "Property experts gave a mixed response to the recent publication of the government's plans for leasehold reform in England and Wales. While ministers presented the draft bill as the answer to leaseholders' prayers, critics said the proposals stopped short of freeing flat owners from the clutches of greedy freeholders. <p>Closer inspection of the documents reveals that how much owners of leasehold flats and houses benefit from the changes depends upon their particular situation. To test the likely impact of the changes on individuals, Jobs &amp; Money asked property expert Paul Brecknell at solicitors Withers to outline how much of a difference the draft proposals would make when implemented to three hypothetical leaseholders wrestling with common problems. </p> <p> <b> 1</b> The residents of a Victorian building containing two flats have an absentee landlord. He refuses to properly maintain the outside of the building. Every now and again they are sent bills for work that hasn't been carried out. They are tired of chasing him up with fruitless phone calls. </p> <p><b> What could they do now?</b> </p> <p> Assuming that the landlord has responsibility for repair of the exterior as is generally the case, the leaseholders could apply to the county court requesting that it appoint a manager under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987. </p> <p>If the court is satisfied that there has been default on the part of the landlord, it will appoint a suitable managing agent to collect the service charges and carry out the landlord's obligations. </p> <p>The alternative would be to buy the freehold if both leaseholders agreed to do so and could afford it. This will also involve an application to the county court with the same documentation that would normally apply to a compulsory purchase by the leaseholders of the freehold. </p> <p>The court will have to be satisfied that at least one leaseholder has lived in his or her flat for the past 12 months or for three years out of the past 10 years. The price payable will be independently established by a valuer and the money paid into court for the landlord. </p> <p>Of course, if the leaseholders can track down the landlord, they can suggest he appoint a managing agent to manage because he can recover the costs from the leaseholders and it won't cost him anything. Failing his agreeing to that, they can take him to court and force him to carry out his obligations. </p> <p> <b> What could they do if the reforms are implemented?</b> </p> <p> The most obvious solution to the leaseholders' problems would be to take advantage of the new right to manage. This is a right for the leaseholders themselves to manage, rather than someone appointed by the court. The application procedure is similar to that which is applied to the compulsory purchase of the freehold. </p> <p>By taking over the management of the building the leaseholders will be able to administer their own service charges, although the landlord will still have a say in the management of the building by virtue of having voting rights in the management company. The government's proposals in relation to the number of votes the landlord would get in this situation have not yet been fully formulated. </p> <p>However, in this case it seems likely that the leaseholders would have effective control of the management company even in the unlikely event that the absentee landlord popped up and voted. </p> <p> <b> 2</b> Two leasehold flats are above a leasehold shop. Once again, the freeholder is absent and refuses to maintain the building. The leaseholders do bits and pieces, but the shop leaseholder refuses to contribute because he doesn't live there. </p> <p><b> What could they do now?</b> </p> <p> The shop owner's lease will generally contain some service charge provisions but these apply only to costs incurred by the landlord. The leaseholders cannot there fore recover any part of the monies they have spent. The most obvious solution here would again be to apply for the appointment of a manager under the 1987 Act to carry out the landlord's function. </p> <p> <b> What could they do if the reforms are implemented?</b> </p> <p> Again, the most obvious solution would be to exercise the right to manage. This should allow the leaseholders to take control but a note of caution should once more be sounded in relation to the voting rights in the management company. </p> <p>The leaseholders would only be able to buy the freehold if the shop premises do not represent more than 25% of the overall internal floor area of the building. However, even if the compulsory purchase of the freehold is possible, it is unlikely that the leaseholders would want to buy the landlord's interest in the shop and end up as the owners of the freehold reversion to that shop. </p> <p>It may, therefore, be preferable to rely on the 1987 Act right and seek the appointment of a manager under current law. </p> <p> <b> 3</b> Leaseholders in a block of 30 flats receive frequent demands from their freeholder for maintenance payments. Work has been done but it is sub-standard. The flat owners have got together to write letters demanding to see the accounts but to no avail. They are withholding payments and the freeholder has threatened them with court action. </p> <p><b> What could they do now?</b> </p> <p> The landlord will only be able to require payment if he has complied with the consultation procedures laid down by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. </p> <p>Moreover under the 1985 Act, service charges can only be recovered to the extent that they relate to works of a reasonable standard. The leaseholders could therefore refer the dispute to the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal. </p> <p>As mentioned, under the current law the landlord cannot seek to forfeit the lease (bring it to an end) without first taking the dispute to the tribunal for resolution, but the landlord could make a claim for the sums owed in the county court. </p> <p>There is no award of costs in the tribunal but split between a majority of the leaseholders, this would probably be the most economic remedy. </p> <p>If the landlord were to take the matter to the county court and obtain a judgment to recover any charges at all then the leaseholders could be required to pay some or all of the landlord's costs. </p> <p>The leaseholders should not withhold payment of all service charges if some are properly due. If they have a good idea of the value of the defective works, they could withhold that element of the charges. This should protect them from an adverse costs order. </p> <p>Although the leaseholders are demanding to see the accounts, they are only currently entitled to a costs summary certified by an accountant. That would only appear once the year's service charge accounts have been finalised. That could be anything up to 18 months after the costs have occurred. The certification is limited and should not be confused with an audit. </p> <p>The leaseholders do have the right to inspect and copy the accounts, invoices, etc. that support the costs summary and the landlord must comply with a request to inspect within one month. If the landlord won't oblige, it will be necessary to threaten an application to the court for an order - naturally to include a claim for costs. </p> <p> <b> What could they do if the reforms are implemented?</b> </p> <p> The landlord could be required to get an accountant to explain what certification actually involves. One of the leaseholders may have the right to inspect at any time within 21 days of a request to do so. </p> <p>There may also be a right to withhold payments up to a certain level when a landlord has failed to provide the information required to by law. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.lease-advice.org/ \" target=\"_NEW\">www.lease-advice.org/ </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.withers.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">www.withers.co.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.carl.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Campaign for the Abolition of Residential Leasehold</a></p>",
  "A doctor arrives at the scene of an accident to discover two injured men. He immediately sees that one is so badly hurt that he is bound to die but the second could be saved. But the first man is lying on top of the second and moving him would inevitably hasten his death. <p>What should the doctor do? Would it be right for him to move the first man even though this would accelerate his death in order to save the life of the second? Does he have the right to choose to save one life though his actions would harm a second? </p> <p>This is the sort of dilemma - taking in complex legal, moral and ethical issues - which the lawyers embroiled in the case of conjoined twins Jodie and Mary have been confronting as they frame arguments for and against the separation operation which would save one of the girls but kill the other. </p> <p>At one level, the case is a heartbreaking human story. It is impossible to imagine the torment of the girls' parents whose Roman Catholic beliefs mean that they cannot give permission for a procedure which would bring about the death of Mary, only kept alive by the oxygenated blood she receives from her sister. On another level, the case has raised a series of profound questions which are troubling some of Britain's sharpest legal minds and most serious moral and religious thinkers. </p> <p>Ultimately, the case could have implications about the way the courts and society at large look at fundamental life and death issues. </p> <p>This weekend a team of eminent lawyers will be attempting, at the behest of the attorney general, to pin down one of the central legal problems of the case - whether the separation will constitute a criminal offence. </p> <p>If, when the appeal recommences on Wednesday, a definitive argument concludes that the operation could be judged as murder or manslaughter, then the job of the three judges becomes infinitely more straightforward. </p> <p>The courts cannot authorise a step which would \"actively terminate a life\" - even to relieve misery and even if the patient or a parent consents. Life can never be terminated by a positive action, such as an injection, but only by the withdrawal of treatment or food. </p> <p>In the original high court ruling which gave doctors the go-ahead to carry out the separation, Mr Justice Johnson based his judgement on the assertion that Mary's death would be caused by the interruption or withdrawal of the blood supply. This could be compared to the withholding of nourishment, as in the case of Hillsborough football disaster survivor Tony Bland, who spent almost four years in a persistent vegetative state before a ruling that doctors would not be acting unlawfully if they stopped feeding him by tube. </p> <p>From the start of the appeal, the issue of lawfulness has been central. Lord Justice Brooke, a former chairman of the law commission, described the criminal law aspects of the case as \"astonishingly difficult\". In one of the most dramatic moments of the case, he brandished a photograph of the girls and asked how a separation could be carried out without a criminal assault on Mary. </p> <p>The judges also raised the possibility that a crime might be committed if an operation took place because it would lead to Mary's death - or if it did not because this would lead to Jodie's death. If the twins remained conjoined, doctors believe both will die within six months. </p> <p>Entwined in this legal argument is the most difficult moral issue. Can it ever be right for a doctor to save one life at the expense of another? </p> <p>Ethicists believe the problem can be approached in two ways. A utilitarian approach is that it is better to save one life even at the cost of another. The absolutist approach - as put forward by the parents and largely backed by Catholic thinkers - is that it can never be right to sacrifice a life. </p> <p>The Archbishop of Westminster Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, said: \"There is a fundamental moral principle at stake - no one may commit a wrong action that good may come of it. The parents in this case have made it clear that they love both their children equally and cannot consent to one of them being killed to help the other. I believe this moral instinct is right. It would set a very dangerous precedent to enshrine in English case law that it was ever right to kill a person that good may come of it.\" </p> <p>In 1993 doctors at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia faced a similar quandary over whether to separate conjoined twins Amy and Angela Lakeberg. Doctors said the twins would die within weeks if they were not separated but also knew the operation would result in Amy's death. The parents agreed to the operation and Angela survived for 10 months. </p> <p>The case sparked a national debate. Alice Dreger, an historian of anatomy at the Michi gan State University, was one of those who forcefully put forward the argument that if the twins had been born separate and the health of both was failing, nobody would have suggested that one sickly twin should be killed and her organs taken for the sake of the other. </p> <p>David Thomasma, professor of medical ethics at Chicago's Loyola University Medical Centre, also studied the moral implications of the Lakeberg case. He said: \"I remember during the debate how quickly people who wanted to intervene could move into the idea that one twin was like a parasite or an appendage - language that makes one morally able to divide them.\" </p> <p>In former times, conjoined twins were often used at funfair freak shows. Even today the way they should be regarded remains unclear. During the appeal, Lord Justice Ward put the problem in stark terms when he asked if Jodie and Mary were individuals or the \"more horrifying concept\" of one person with two heads. </p> <p>At another point his comments echoed the idea of the weaker of the twins being a parasite when he said: \"She's hooked into her sister, draining her sister's life blood from her and will eventually kill her.\" </p> <p>If they could be treated as a single entity, it might have made the decision easier: an operation to separate Mary from Jodie could have been compared to a procedure to remove a diseased limb threatening a whole body. </p> <p>At first glance the law concerning the parents seems more straightforward. While \"great weight\" has to be attached to their wishes, the court has a duty to ignore them in the best interests of the child. </p> <p>But Richard Nicholson, editor of the Bulletin of Medical Ethics, suggested that the judges in this instance simply could not make the decision. \"In a situation like this when there isn't an obvious right answer, do we not need to put the onus for the decision back on to those for whom it will mean the most, those who are going to have to live with the consequences of the decision? Surely we have to give great power and credence to the parents?\" </p> <p>A complicating factor here is the extraordinary circumstances which have resulted in the case being heard before a British court. The parents come from a remote, unidentified European community with different customs and values to Britain's. They are here because their government has an agreement with Britain that a certain number of people can be treated within the NHS. </p> <p>Presumably their case would be treated differently if they came before the courts in their own country. But legal experts believe that any efforts by the parents to leave - not that there has been a suggestion that they have tried to - could result in the twins being made wards of court. In effect they are trapped. </p> <p>And so to the inevitable question of religion. In another dramatic courtroom moment, Lord Justice Ward suggested that it could not be \"God's will\" that Mary survive because she had not been born with the capacity for independent life. The parents' position remains that it is not \"God's will\" that people terminate life. </p> <p>Much of modern British criminal law - which will be the subject of microscopic examination this weekend by those who will be representing the attorney general on Wednesday - is based on 19th-century case law made by judges basing their conclusions on Judaeo-Christian principles. </p> <p>The thorny question of whether Mary was a \"viable\" being has also been addressed. If she had not been connected to Jodie she would have died because she lacked a functioning heart or lungs. </p> <p>The judges queried whether Mary had in fact been \"born alive\" given the fact that she depended on her twin for her very life breath. </p> <p>Pro life campaigners are appalled at the notion that Mary might not be considered to have been born alive, pointing out that a decision which would lead to her death could be the thin end of a terrifying wedge. Could a ruling which called into question Mary's very right to be thought of as a human being have implications for severely disabled people? </p> <p>Helen Watt, research fellow at the Linacre Centre for Healthcare Ethics, said: \"Medicine is all about supporting ill people. There are disabled people all over the country who without medical help would die. Are they all non-persons?\" </p> <p>But is Mary's life worthwhile? Technological advances, of course, mean that increasingly patients can be kept alive even when in many eyes death would be preferable. </p> <p>Former master of the rolls Lord Donaldson ruled that a \"balancing exercise\" was needed. There was a \"strong presumption\" in a course of action which would prolong life but said it was not \"irrebuttable\". Account had to be taken of the pain, suffering and quality of life which a child would experience if life was prolonged. </p> <p>Counsel on behalf of Mary insisted that the sanctity of life - again a phrase with religious resonances - meant that there was a powerful argument for her to be kept alive in the absence of the lack of proof that she was in pain. </p> <p>The ethicists point out in a secular society whose people do not believe in a life after death, the fact of physical existence becomes ever more important and the efforts of doctors are concentrated ever more on keeping life going no matter what. </p> <p>When those decisions are opposed by parents who do have a strong faith - and have to be ratified in a court whose laws are based on religious principles - there is bound to be a clash. </p> <p> <b>Battle to discard 'circus act' description of babies</b> <br> <b>Raekha Prasad</b></p> <p> In Italy they are gemelli siamesi ; the French call them fr\u00e8res siamois or soeurs siamoises ; and in Spanish they are hermanos siameses or hermanas siamesas . Even the Thais - who no longer refer to their country as Siam - use the term to describe twins whose bodies are joined. </p> <p>Although it is being used to describe the case of Mary and Jodie, a spokesman for Great Ormond Street children's hospital, said: \"'Siamese twins' is not used by anyone in the hospital. We consider it inaccurate and patronising, unless the twins are actually from Thailand. We have had a small battle since the beginning of this story to correct the term.\" </p> <p>It comes from Chang and Eng Bunker, born joined at the chest in Thailand in 1811. They became a US circus act. </p> <p>Harvey Marcovitch, a consultant paediatrician and editor of the journal of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the term had not been used in medical circles for at least 20 years; the profession used it only when talking to lay people. Conjoined was used instead. </p> <p> In the 1960s the term spastic was not considered pejorative. It became cerebral palsy and is now neuron-impaired. Until the second world war, it was acceptable to call people with learning disabilities morons and idiots. By the 1970s the preferred term was educationally subnormal. By the 1980s it had changed to learning disabilities, and now one term used is special needs.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com</a> Conjoined Twins <a href=\"http://www.twinstuff.com/conjoined.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">www.twinstuff.com/conjoined.htm</a> Twin Stuff: conjoined twins</p>",

  "Eleven residents of a small village in Indonesian West Timor were murdered on Thursday by a rampaging mob, the Indonesian military confirmed yesterday. <p>Unnamed UN sources in the East Timorese capital, Dili, said the death toll was 20 but they refused to give details and the reports could not be confirmed. </p> <p>It is thought that the perpetrators were pro-Jakarta militiamen linked to the group that killed three UN workers in the nearby town of Atambua the previous day. </p> <p>As militiamen continued house-to-house searches and set up roadblocks across West Timor in a bid to find anyone linked to international humanitarian organisations, the UN completed its airlift of approximately 300 foreign and local employees of international organisations that have been working in West Timor. </p> <p>Major-General Kiki Syahnakri, Indonesia's regional commander covering West Timor, told UN officials that the massacre occurred in the village of Bese Kama, a few miles from the border with East Timor. He claimed that it happened during a clash between local people and some of the tens of thousands of East Timorese refugees living in the area. </p> <p>\"Kiki said the locals were driven from their homes in the chaos,\" said Jake Morland, a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees West Timor operation, who is now in Bali. </p> <p>\"Indonesian soldiers guarding the border with East Timor left their posts and went to the village to restore order. It was as they were doing that that they discovered the bodies.\" Neither the victims' identities nor ages were released. </p> <p>While the Indonesian Army is blaming the East Timorese refugees, the UN believes it is the militia living among the refugees who are responsible for the current violence. </p> <p>Bese Kama is an area where the UNHCR has been unable to operate since July because of threats and violence against its staff. After its office in the nearest town, Betum, was stoned seven weeks ago the staff were pulled out and have not been back since. </p> <p>A police intelligence sergeant in Atambua said yesterday: \"The militia are in complete control in many areas around Betum. We are waiting for more reinforcements before we can even attempt to restore law and order.\" </p> <p>There are more than 2,500 Indonesian police and soldiers currently in West Timor but they appear to be having little impact on the militia. </p> <p>\"The militia are moving around West Timor with impunity,\" Mr Morland said. \"They are going from house to house searching for anyone who has had links to us or our partner organisations.\" </p> <p>The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the militia are not a homogeneous force, but disparate rumps of various paramilitary groups that existed in East Timor before the independence referendum just over a year ago. Their ranks have been swelled by thousands of new recruits. </p> <p>Indonesian officials admit the situation is deteriorating, but the government in Jakarta appears to have little sense of crisis. Senior security minister Bambang Yudhoyono merely said yesterday that it was doing all it could \"to find a comprehensive solution and total settlement regarding the refugees and the militias and interaction between them\". </p> <p>In a stinging editorial yesterday, the influential Jakarta Post said: \"The government has wasted too much time pussyfooting with the military, who seem determined to prevent their senior generals from facing trial [over the destruction in East Timor last year]. </p> <p>\"Surely the government must now realise that the shame and disgrace which the Atambua killings have brought on the entire nation is simply too high a price to pay to shield the dozens of murderous generals... and militia leaders.\"</p>",
  "A senior policeman alleged to have been \"unable to control his sexual behaviour\" was cleared yesterday of sexually assaulting two women. <p>Ian Beckett, deputy chief constable of Surrey police, had denied charges of indecently assaulting the two civilian workers at the force's headquarters in Guildford in December 1998. </p> <p>After the jury at Southwark crown court returned the not guilty verdicts, it was revealed that Mr Beckett had tried to kill himself last March by taking an overdose of pills. </p> <p>The prosecution had accused Mr Beckett, 54, of subjecting the women, who cannot be named, to \"humiliating and degrading\" ordeals. </p> <p>One told the jury of first being hugged in his locked and darkened office and on a later occasion being forced to endure him touching her private parts after he asked her to wear red underwear for him as a \"Christmas treat\". </p> <p>The other woman said Mr Beckett, a father of two from Chertsey, Surrey, put his hand up her skirt to touch the top of her thigh in an initial attack, before kissing her and fondling one of her breasts in a follow-up assault. Later, she alleged he repeatedly asked her to let him make love to her. </p> <p>But the jury took just over five-hours to clear him of four counts of indecency. In his defence, Mr Beckett had claimed he was the victim of \"lies and fantasy\". </p> <p>As the not guilty verdicts were returned, Mr Beckett, who has been suspended on full pay since January last year, smiled. Gaynor, his wife of 33 years who was in the court throughout the trial, burst into tears and hugged him. </p> <p>Sallie Bennett-Jenkins, prosecuting, told the jury that Mr Beckett regarded himself as the \"top dog\" as he \"abused his position to carry out sexual assaults of increasing gravity\". </p> <p>She claimed the \"first rate\" officer had \"taken advantage of his position to intimidate and humiliate the two women and subject them to quite appalling behaviour\". </p> <p>The jury was told that Mr Beckett was \"unable to control his sexual behaviour\". </p> <p>After his acquittal, Mr Beckett's solicitor, Peter Williams, read a statement on his behalf: \"I and my family are relieved the right verdict was reached in a case which has caused us enormous trauma. </p> <p>\"I now ask that we might return to the privacy and dignity of my family life. And of course I'm looking forward to returning to Surrey police as its committed deputy chief constable.\" </p> <p>The court heard that when interviewed by City of London officers about the women's claims, Mr Beckett said they could be connected to the fact that he had disciplined two of their friends after an incident with a pornographic email. </p> <p>Mr Beckett also branded one of his accusers - known only as Mrs X - as a \"very, very unhappy\" woman who was both incompetent and a liar. </p> <p>The Surrey police authority will meet on Monday to discuss whether Mr Beckett, who is still suspended from duty, will keep his job. </p> <p>Its chairman, Alan Peirce, said: \"Other disciplinary matters, not the subject of the criminal trial, may have been committed.\" </p> <p>Referring to the possible disciplinary hearing against Mr Beckett, Denis O'Connor, chief constable of Surrey, said: \"I am aware of three other issues raised by other individuals ... the matters involved are matters to some degree similar.\" </p> <p>Regarding the two women who gave evidence during the trial, he said: \"Both women do work for Surrey police and we have supported them throughout and will continue to do so.\"</p>",
  "Japan was shaken by its biggest spy scandal in 20 years and Moscow exposed to public embarrassment when police seized a senior Japanese officer yesterday on suspicion of leaking confidential documents to a Russian military attache suspected of working for his country's secret service. <p>The unexpected flashback to the cold war prompted an angry exchange of accusations between Tokyo and Moscow, just three days after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ended his first official visit to Tokyo by rejecting Japanese claims to four disputed islands. </p> <p>With that in mind, Japan's choice of this moment to swoop on the naval officer and a Russian diplomatic contact may not be entirely coincidental. Their relationship had been monitored for some time, according to the authorities. </p> <p>Police said that they caught Shigehiro Hagisaki, 38, who worked as a researcher at the national institute for defence studies and held the rank of lieutenant-commander, as he was passing secret papers to a Russian military attache in a restaurant in Tokyo. </p> <p>According to the state-owned television channel NHK, the attache, Victor Bogatenkov, 44, is a member of the GRU, the intelligence service which replaced the KGB after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Mr Bogatenkov has claimed diplomatic immunity from questioning and arrest. </p> <p>Detectives are reported to have watched the two men exchange envelopes at about 10 meetings in the past year at Chinese restaurants and at bars. Mr Hagisaki is said by the authorities to have admitted supplying information in return for money. </p> <p>The extent of the leak remains unclear. Mr Hagisaki worked in the documents division of Japan's navy, known as the maritime self-defence forces because the country's post-war constitution restricts it from formally having offensive military capabilities. </p> <p>He is believed to have had access to sensitive information about his country's submarine forces and about security cooperation with other states. </p> <p>Embarrassingly for the government, police allege that in searches of the suspect's house and office they found files on the US navy. Washington is Tokyo's main ally. </p> <p>\"This incident invites mis trust about Japan's defence arrangments both at home and overseas,\" said Hidenao Nakagawa, the government's main spokesman. </p> <p>The defence minister, Toshio Torashima, said the accused officer's actions were \"unforgiveable\" and said a complaint would be lodged with Russia once the details of the case were clarified. </p> <p>But in Moscow a government spokesman took a pugnacious tone, calling the arrest unfriendly and provocative. \"Japan, unfortunately, has forces that want to turn the clock backwards because they are unhappy at the radical improvement in bilateral relations,\" said an official quoted by the news agency Itar-Tass. </p> <p>Tokyo and Moscow have yet to sign a peace treaty more than 55 years after the end of the second world war because of a sovereignty dispute over the Kurile islands to the north of Japan that were seized by Soviet troops in 1945. </p> <p>Three years ago, when relations were warming, the two countries's leaders pledged to work towards settling this problem by the end of 2000. </p> <p>Earlier this week, however, Mr Putin turned down a compromise by the Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, who suggested Moscow could cede administrative control in return for agreed sovereignty. This rejection killed off any chance of agreement by the end-of-year deadline. </p> <p>The two leaders parted with public smiles and promises to cooperate more on regional security, but the lack of progress was a huge disappointment for many in Japan.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Go-Ahead bids for franchises</strong><br> </p> <p>Transport group Go-Ahead is considering five more bids for train franchises while its reputation is under heavy scrutiny after the Paddington rail crash. </p> <p>As its interim results were published yesterday, it said it was interested in high density franchises which will come up for negotiation over the next few years. Pre-tax profits before one-off costs rose 8% to \u00a344.8m. A final 9.2p dividend has resulted in 13p for the year, a 13%increase. </p> <p>It has rejected a \u00a3262m takeover bid by the French state-controlled holding company CDC. Go-Ahead's share stands at 702p. </p> <p><strong> Money pours in at Leeds United </strong><br> </p> <p>Leeds United last night revealed it was enjoying its most successful financial start to a season. Its owner Leeds Sporting, expects to reap \u00a310m from money-spinning draws against Barcelona and AC Milan in the Champions League. It also predicts \u00a322m will be generated over the next three years as a result of eight sponsorship deals. </p> <p><strong> IMF offers fast track help</strong><br> </p> <p>Aid agencies yesterday welcomed a pledge by the International Monetary Fund to fast-track 20 countries through the west's debt relief programme by the end of the year. </p> <p>At a meeting with the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and representatives from the main churches, Horst Kohler, IMF's new head, outlined proposals to tackle the logjams in the heavily indebted poor countries programme which has so far failed to live up to expectations. </p> <p>At present many countries are paying more in debt service to western creditors than they do on health and education. </p> <p><strong> Condon joins security firm</strong><br> </p> <p>Former Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Paul Condon has joined the board of security firm Securicor as a non-executive director. </p> <p>\"Paul's wealth of police experience at the most senior level will be invaluable to us in maintaining our relationships with law enforcement agencies, both in Britain and overseas,\" said Securicor's chairman, Sir Neil Macfarlane. </p> <p><strong> Hitachi may cut TV jobs</strong><br> </p> <p>Electrical giant Hitachi refused to comment on reports that around 350 of the 530 employees at its television factory in Hirwaun, south Wales, may loose their jobs. The company said its colour televisions had \"struggled to achieve profitability\" in recent years, and budgeted losses for the current year were in excess of \u00a34m. </p> <p>It added that there was \"no prospect of recovery\" since prices for television sets had been slashed by up to 20% in recent years.</p>",
  "<p>The Government's \u00a312bn plan to turn the London Underground into a private-public partnership by March 2001 could be undermined by its failure to clear considerable safety problems. </p> <p>The Health and Safety Executive announced last night that it was planning an audit of the LU in December to ensure that safety conditions were being met. It could not accept any plans for change unless it was \"completely happy\" with the safety case. </p> <p>The transfer to the private sector, which still leaves the state exercising overall control, would have to be abandoned if safety was at stake. </p> <p>The HSE said that it was still looking for improvements in the new safety regime. It said it had learnt lessons from the Paddington crash last October, caused partly by the re-alignment of the track outside the station in the lead up to privatisation. </p> <p>LU has already been singled out by the HSE for its approach to safety. Railway inspectors have criticised senior LU managers for a diffident attitude to the issue. </p> <p>The public's perception of the underground - one of the biggest in the world - is that it is detoriating. There have been several high profile incidents in the past few weeks, culminating in a serious case earlier this week when some 2,000 people were trapped on the Central line for two hours without fresh air. </p> <p>The HSE said last night that it was \"extremely concerned\", particularly as LU was committed to getting passengers out within 30 minutes following an incident. </p> <p>LU later said that the target was self-imposed, following the King's Cross fire in 1989. The HSE also criticised LU for waiting for an hour before calling the fire brigade. In reponse LU said it had in fact waited only 37 minutes. Even then it had delayed the call because it felt it could cope with the incident itself. </p> <p>Critics of the HSE say that it is only taking a tough stance against LU because of the Paddington crash. It is expected that the HSE will be criticised for not taking tough action with Railtrack and the train operating companies for signals passed at danger. It has already admitted that its inspection procedures could be improved. </p> <p>The HSE also said that new rolling stock on the underground was breaking down, and was unreliable. LU replied that the system was performing satisfactorily. </p> <p>The government is still pouring money into the LU. The Jubilee line extension is not finished, nine months after it was started. </p> <p>Remedial work is still being carried out at Westminster station, where the threat of water seeping in, has not yet been averted.</p>",
  "The uncharacteristic fury expressed by Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, over this week's killing of three aid workers in West Timor was fully justified. Thanks to the New York summit of world leaders, Mr Annan was able to inform Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid of his disgust in person. The security situation in the Indonesian-run province, where thousands of pro-Jakarta militiamen still roam unchecked a year after neighbouring East Timor's independence referendum provoked an orgy of killing, was totally unacceptable, Mr Annan said. His criticism was echoed by both Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, and by Sadako Ogata, the UNHCR chief, whose agency has logged over 100 attacks on its personnel in West Timor in the past 12 months. The evacuation of remaining UN staff now exposes 120,000 refugees to great hardship amid reports yesterday of new militia murders. <p>But for all the understandable anger, such protests are unlikely to have much practical impact. In truth, Mr Wahid exercises little or no direct control over events in West Timor or, for that matter, in several other troubled regions of his fragmented country. His decision to send in troop reinforcements may only make matters worse, given that elements within the army are intimately linked to the Timor militias - just as they are deeply implicated in continuing anti-separatist and ethnic and religious violence in places as far apart as Aceh, Sulawesi, Ambon and Papua. Mr Wahid's sacking of the deeply suspect armed forces chief, General Wiranto, has not enabled him to rein in a military that grew accustomed to autonomy of action (and money-making opportunities) during ex-president Suharto's dictatorship. </p> <p>Demands by human rights groups that commanders, soldiers and militiamen responsible for the East Timor atrocities be called to account have so far brought forth an official list of a mere 19 suspects who may or may not face prosecution. Gen Wiranto is not among them. External pressure for an independent, international war crimes tribunal has been rebuffed. The Jakarta parliament, where Mr Wahid's grip is also tenuous, has meanwhile passed a constitutional amendment allowing the granting of retrospective amnesties for rights abuses. Mr Suharto, on trial for corruption and pleading Pinochet-like incapacity, has for his part already been assured of a presidential pardon should he be found guilty. </p> <p>Since winning office last October, Mr Wahid has struggled to make his mark, hindered in part by the detached attitude of his deputy, Megawati Sukarnoputri, whom many Indonesians felt was unfairly denied the presidency, but also by his own policy vagueness, indecision, and penchant for foreign travel. An ambitious cabinet reshuffle last month seems to have failed to reboot his administration; indeed, it led to a run on the rupiah. Although the IMF this week readied the latest $400m tranche of a $5bn bail-out, Indonesia's economic position remains dangerously fraught. When this is taken alongside Mr Wahid's evident political weakness and the chaotic security situation, it is little wonder that there is renewed speculation in Jakarta about a fresh government crisis, plots and coups, and regional concern that Indonesia as a unified democracy is drifting towards disintegration. </p> <p>All of which instability and uncertainty is bad news indeed for the fledgling, penniless nation of East Timor, at present under UN administration but due to take charge of its own affairs by the end of next year. The trauma of its birth may be very far from over.</p>",
  "The embattled Republican presidential candidate George W Bush has been forced to respond to a chorus of party criticism and a run of bad poll results by re-energising his campaign style and giving his slogans a face-lift in the contest with the Democrat Al Gore. <p>Mr Bush has decided to increase the tempo of what has sometimes seemed an unduly leisurely schedule. Instead he now intends to be seen getting in among the voters more, cutting down on set-piece speeches in favour of more glad-handing, and campaigning on a new theme of \"Real Plans for Real People.\" </p> <p>\"I've got to get out and talk to people, and I'm going to do a lot of it,\" Mr Bush said in Pennsylvania yesterday. \"I'm going to tell you what I think, and let the political chips fall where they may.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush has decided to redefine himself as the underdog in the race with Mr Gore, who has drawn level and even moved ahead of him for the first time in some recent opinion polls. The move echoes a change of direction in Mr Bush's campaign for the Republican nomination earlier this year after John McCain defeated him in the New Hampshire primary. </p> <p>Mr Bush has also signalled that he wants to extricate himself from the cul-de-sac he got himself into over the planned series of debates with Mr Gore later in the autumn. In a U-turn from the position he adopted as recently as Monday, Mr Bush has reopened negotiations with Mr Gore on the debate schedule. </p> <p>Criticism of the Bush campaign from within the party has focused on a range of perceived failings, including the strategy towards the debates. Other issues include the use of negative advertising, the failure to make the case for Mr Bush's $1.3 trillion (\u00a3900bn) tax cut plan, the lacklustre performance of Mr Bush's running-mate Dick Cheney, and the tight control exercised by Mr Bush's Texas-based team in Austin. </p> <p>But with the polls showing that Mr Bush's lead of a few weeks ago has now evaporated, the Republican challenger is eager to shore up his support by claiming that he is facing the fight of his political life. </p> <p>\"This is going to be a tight race,\" Mr Bush said. \"I guess my supporters wanted it to be a runaway. The vice-president is running a strong race, but so am I. I am under no illusions and neither should our supporters be. I am the underdog - I sure am.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush tried to laugh off several days of increasingly vocal criticisms of his campaign from within his own party. \"That's Washington,\" he told reporters in Michigan. \"That's the place where you find people getting ready to jump out of the foxholes before the first shell is fired.\" </p> <p>Asked why he has decided to change tack by going more informal, Mr Bush responded: \"Well, it's a better picture.\" </p> <p>What is officially described as a campaign \"retooling\" comes as three new polls showed Mr Gore either tied with Mr Bush or ahead of him. A Zogby poll has Mr Gore leading by 46% to Mr Bush's 40%, while the first of a series of Gallup three-day tracking polls has Mr Gore up by 47% to 44%. A Washington Post poll shows the two men level on 47% each. </p> <p>The latest poll in one of the key states in the election also shows Mr Gore taking the lead in Missouri by 45% to 41%. </p> <p>Mr Bush's slide in the polls in the past two weeks has provoked a mood of near panic among some of his supporters. \"There's no doubt about it. There's real worry about the general state of things,\" said the conservative campaigner William Bennett, a former education secretary. \"There's nervousness that was not there before.\" </p> <p>\"The biggest mistake we can make is to try to be all things to all people,\" the Missouri congressman John Kasich said. </p> <p>\"I'm at a loss to explain the rather significant change in the polling numbers,\" Tom Ridge, governor of Pennsylvania, said.</p>",
  "The UN's battered reputation as a peacekeeper suffered another blow yesterday after disclosures of massive corruption on the part of the Nigerian element of the UN force in Sierra Leone. <p>An internal UN report about the Nigerian force brutally exposes the gap between the peacekeeping ideals expressed by world leaders at the millennium summit in New York this week and the reality on the ground in the conflict zones. </p> <p>The focus of the summit, which ended yesterday, was on making peacekeeping forces more efficient and more tightly-controlled, primarily in Africa, following the disaster in Rwanda that led to genocide and the debacle in Sierra Leone that saw 500 UN soldiers being taken hostage. </p> <p>The UN report on the Nigerian force in Sierra Leone reinforces the need for haste in pushing through the reforms. </p> <p>It raises questions about the effectiveness of multinational forces and whether soldiers from round the world can work together for a common aim. The report was written by the Indian commander, Major General Vijay Kumar Jetley, who complained repeatedly about how he and his troops were denigrated by the Nigerians. There has been strife too between the Nigerians and British troops. </p> <p>The alternative to a multinational force from continents round the world is a regional force. But the Nigerian performance in Sierra Leone also calls that into question. </p> <p>The British defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, and the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, supported the idea of regional peacekeeping forces, especially for conflicts such as the one in Sierra Leone. But the fear now is that if the Nigerians behaved so badly as part of a multinational force, they would be even worse if they were the main force operating in the west African country. </p> <p>Sierra Leone is the biggest UN peacekeeping operation at present, with troops from around the world, and with moves to increase their number from 13,000 to 20,000. Nigeria, with 6,000 troops in the force, would like to have overall control and increase its contingent. </p> <p>The report is an embarrassment to the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, who wants to establish his country as the regional power. Mr Obasanjo, who was at the UN summit yesterday, has gone a long way towards improving Nigeria's image after years of dictatorship. But his efforts are being undone by his army. According to the UN report, the Nigerian army has obstructed peace moves in Sierra Leone because its officers and men are getting rich through illegally trading in diamonds. </p> <p>The report supports a stream of complaints in the Sierra Leone capital, Freetown, about the Nigerian force. Reports from diverse sources claimed that the Nigerian army was heavily involved in diamonds, false passports, drug-smuggling and other illegal activities. Nigeria is one of the biggest drug centres in Africa and the allegation was that Sierra Leone provided a useful transition point for the shipment of drugs from Nigeria to Europe. </p> <p>A by-product of this was that the Nigerian army supplied drugs to the Revolutionary United Front rebels, whose ill-disciplined troops have heavy drug habits that go part of the way to explaining the ferocity of their attacks on civilians. </p> <p>Many of the claims could not be substantiated because they came from the RUF. But others were more credible, such as a pilot working out of Freetown's Lunghi airport who claimed to have knowledge of heavy drug trafficking. </p> <p>At the heart of it all are Sierra Leone's diamonds. In return for drugs, the Nigerians allegedly receive from the rebels rough diamonds, which are easily sold in Antwerp and Tel Aviv. </p> <p>The story of the UN is about a chasm between the high ideals at headquarters and the chaos and corruption on the ground. </p> <p>Gen Jetley complained that the Nigerians put national interest before the good of the UN force. That may be true. But there are many cases of multinational forces co-existing: grumbling, as soldiers do, but getting on with the job, in the Balkans, the Middle East and elsewhere. </p> <p>The issue in Sierra Leone may be partly one of personality, with Gen Jetley using the report to settle scores with the Nigerians. </p> <p>The report has to be seen in the context of internal politicking within the UN force in Freetown. The Nigerians resent the fact that they were not given command of the force. The Indians, British and other members of the force would like to see the Nigerians go home, or at the very least ensure that no more arrive. </p> <p>But troops for UN operations are not that easy to find. Replacing the 6,000 Nigerians would be difficult. The crux is whether they help or obstruct a move towards peace. </p> <p>Corruption in armies is commonplace in Africa. Against the corruption has to be balanced the fact that the Nigerians are one of the most effective fighting forces in Sierra Leone, with the most success in taking on the rebels. </p> <p>A reluctant acceptance of some level of corruption would be regarded as worthwhile by the UN if it was coupled with successful suppression of the RUF and a restoration of peace. </p> <p><b>Profit over peace</b></p> <p>The following are extracts from the report accusing Nigerian officers and officials of colluding with the RUF rebels in Sierra Leone, written by Major-General Vijay Jetley, the embattled commander of the UN peacekeeping force there </p> <p>\u0095The Nigerian army was interested in staying in Sierra Leone due to massive benefits they were getting from<b> illegal diamond mining</b> </p> <p>\u0095Brigadier-General Maxwell Khobe was commonly known as the <b> \"Ten Million man\"</b> : it is alleged that he received up to $10m (\u00a36.6m) to permit the activities of RUF. The [West African intervention] force commander Major-General Kpamber was also involved. </p> <p>\u0095It is understood that a tacit understanding was reached between the RUF and [the Nigerians] of non-interference in each other's activities. Protecting Nigerian interests was paramount even if it meant <b> scuttling the peace process</b> </p> <p>\u0095To this end the special representative [of the UN in Sierra Leone, Oluyemi Adeniji] and the deputy force commander cultivated the RUF leadership, especially <b> Foday Sankoh</b>, behind my back </p> <p>\u0095The Mission Directive given to me... directly conflicted with the interests of not only the warring factions but also of the major players in the diamond racket like Liberia and Nigeria.

  "In exile and in war, Yasser Arafat has personified his people's aspirations through four turbulent decades and today, with the Palestinians closer to regaining statehood than at any time since 1948, he will take another historic decision: to invite the wrath of Israel and the US by declaring independence next week, or to wait. <p>Mr Arafat's appearance before the Palestine Liberation Organisation's central council in Gaza city this weekend follows another difficult choice, his refusal during talks with President Clinton on the sidelines of the UN millennium summit in New York this week, to yield on the Palestinians' claim to Jerusalem. </p> <p>But after giving the council's 127 members his version of what transpired at New York, Mr Arafat is expected to urge a postponement of any unilateral declaration of a state until November 15 at the earliest. </p> <p>This latest delay - Mr Arafat held off such a declaration in May last year - is in part intended to blunt condemnation of the Palestinian leader as the villain of the peace process for his refusal to give Israel sovereignty of Islamic and Christian holy places in those parts of Jerusalem it has occupied since 1967. </p> <p>\"He will sell it to the world, to Europe and America, to show his flexibility,\" said an Arafat adviser, Mamdoh Nofal. \"It is not so important for Mr Arafat to declare on this date, if there is no real change in his position as leader, or in the condition of his people. He has many of the elements of a state. We have 36,000 military men with weapons. We have flags, radio, television, ministries, and a legislative council.\" </p> <p>But there are reasons other than his image for Mr Arafat not to declare statehood. One of them is that he does not have the land for a viable state - his forces have exclusive control of only 40% of the West Bank and Gaza - or the finances. </p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, has threatened to retaliate against any unilateral declaration by annexing territory and imposing a blockade on an economy that is wholly dependent on Israel. </p> <p>Another restraint is the lack of support for statehood now, as the Palestinian leader discovered during a fortnight of flying around world capitals after his peace talks with Mr Barak ended inconclusively at Camp David in July despite much direct involvement by President Bill Clinton. </p> <p>The US and most European countries are among those opposing a unilaterial declaration at present. \"Mr Arafat knows that he struck hard at Mr Clinton and Mr Barak when he refused their plans and he knows they are so angry and they are waiting around the corner to ambush him and take revenge. So he will not give them such a chance to strike by declaring a state,\" Mr Nodal said. </p> <p>And yet Mr Arafat cannot hold off indefinitely without appearing ridiculous to his own people. Many delegates to the PLO's central council - including members of his own Fatah faction - want him to declare a state next week, no matter what the consequences, because they have no trust in a process which has seen Israel consistently break promises to hand over territory, or release political prisoners. </p> <p>Negotiations on a final settlement were scheduled to end by May 4 last year: \"This interim period has already been extended almost 20 months,\" said Daoud Talhami, a Palestine National Council member. \"We are afraid that any further postponement will make self-rule into a permanent situation\" with Israel not taking negotiations seriously, he said. </p> <p>The weekend meeting in Gaza has the veneer of democracy, but few think the council will do more than rubber-stamp a decision that is Mr Arafat's alone. In six years of self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinian leader has taken a personal interest in the most minute details of administration, holding back the maturation of institutions and the judiciary. </p> <p>He will be guided this weekend by that same belief that he knows what is best for Palestinians, and by his concern for his own legacy - manifested at home by a ruthless suppression of Palestinian television and print media. At 71, Mr Arafat is determined not to go down in history as the man who betrayed the Muslim claim to Jerusalem, though he would dearly love to die as the first president of independent Palestine. </p> <p>That was shown again on Thursday during an interview with CNN. \"You have to remember, you are speaking to Yasser Arafat,\" he said when asked if he would compromise on the Haram al-Sharif, the Jerusalem site that has the third holiest shrine of Islam. </p> <p>\"I will continue to liberate all the Islamic and Muslim holy places,\" an agitated Mr Arafat said. \"I can't betray my people. I can't betray the Arabs. I can't betray the Christians. I can't betray the Muslims.\" </p> <p>He has also told the Israelis that he fears assassination should he give up the Islamic holy places in Jerusalem. Held sacred by Muslims, the 36 acres of the Haram al-Sharif is also revered by Jews as the site of their temple, destroyed in 70 AD, with the Western (or Wailing) Wall as its one surviving relic. </p> <p>Palestinians argue that the Israelis and Americans have been unfair to describe Mr Arafat as inflexible, and lacking the courage for bold decisions. They say that he has regularly displayed such mettle as a leader - not least by entering into the peace process seven years ago. </p> <p>The question of whether to abandon heartfelt claims in Jerusalem, said Bassam Abu Sharif, a long-time adviser, \"is not a difficult decision but an impossible one for Arafat\".</p>",
  "Bruce Gyngell, the Australian inventor of British breakfast television, who has died aged 71, was one of the most colourful, idiosyncratic and domineering of media pioneers. He was far removed from the grey-haired executives who have tended to control ITV television behind the scenes. Gyngell stood out even in an industry where media tycoons from Lord (Lew) Grade to Rupert Murdoch called the shots. His staff nicknamed him the \"pink panther\" because of his love for the colour he saw as life-enhancing: he wore pastel pink shirts, and had his office painted pink, with yellow sofas. <p>His 50-year career was packed with dramatic twists, spanning the start of television in Australia - his was the first face to appear on screens - and the introduction of sofa-style television to Britain. Gyngell is best known in the UK for his high-profile completion of the rescue of TV-am, a year after its disastrous launch in 1983. </p> <p>The first commercial breakfast franchise had teetered on the verge of collapse, losing \u00a3500,000 a month, when in 1984 he was persuaded by his Australian colleague, the businessman Kerry Packer (who had taken a rescue stake) to sort it out. By 1986 it was ready for flotation on the stock exchange, and briefly flowered into the most profitable of television networks. This was achieved by ruthlessly targeting programme costs - and dumping the 1984 Olympics coverage. He made the station a place \"of eternal summer so that the lost, lonely people could turn on and feel warm and bright\" - it may have been naff, but it was effective. </p> <p>He singlehandedly invented friendly sofa-style television and chatty presentation - although it was far from easy. The TV-am sofas were actually benches, to encourage guests to sit up, but upholstered to disguise the fact. Viewers felt they joined a surrogate family, with Anne Diamond playing the fresh-faced but smart girl from next door. The company, run from Camden Lock, North London, was moulded around Gyngell and his often faddish likes and dislikes. </p> <p>Some thought him barmy, predatory, or worse. Employees had to fit in. But he encouraged newcomers into television: his former secretary, Ulrika Jonsson, was made the weather girl, to inject some cheer into forecasts. Gyngell broke the rules, and liked to pose as being outside the wasteful British television establishment, while always remem bering to court the powerful. One of his early fallings-out was with a talented rising executive, Greg Dyke, who had already set TV-am on the road to recovery with Roland Rat before Gyngell's arrival. </p> <p>Gyngell, an outspoken believer in market forces, but with charm bordering on charisma, became Margaret Thatcher's favourite broadcasting executive when she was prime minister. When she complained about ITV being the \"last bastion of restrictive practices\", he endured a bruising technicians' strike from 1987-88 - more than 200 were sacked - but suffered a heart attack due to stress. </p> <p>He wanted change in ITV to cut out waste, a redrawing of the regional network, a Channel 5 to provide more competition. But by 1988, he was already speaking out against a blind auction of franchises, recognising the destruction it would wreak. By a cruel twist, the highest-bidder auction that Thatcher introduced in the flawed 1990 Broadcasting Act ensured that TV-am's \u00a314.3m bid was completely overshadowed by a rival offer from the GMTV consortium of \u00a334.6m when the awards were announced in October 1991. TV-am, the company he had shaped and nurtured, was effectively destroyed. </p> <p>But Gyngell had a final surprise up his sleeve. A day after the news broke, he was hosting the first (and last) TV-am journalism awards. There, he dramatically, almost as an afterthought, produced a handwritten letter from Thatcher. He read it out to the astonished audience. \"When I see how some of the licences have been awarded, I am mystified that you did not receive yours and heartbroken. You of all people have done so much for the whole of television . . . I am only too painfully aware that I was responsible for the legislation,\" she wrote. </p> <p>It was a sensation. The audience gasped, then applauded. Thatcher was saying sorry. </p> <p>In true Gyngell style, he refused to be broken. He proceeded to hold the company together until December 31 1992, through sheer force of personality. The final morning's broadcast ended, at 9.30 am, with the station belting out You're Simply the Best as a photograph of everyone who had ever worked for the station was flashed on to the screen. It was a moment of high emotion, and great sadness. </p> <p>Gyngell then hosted a champagne-fuelled farewell party with the sole founder-survivor, Sir David Frost, by his side. Yet, true to promise, the severance terms were very generous, and many of his multi-skilled, hard-working staff were snapped up by GMTV and the rest of ITV. Five years later, he had the bitter satisfaction of being proved right as the licence payments were slashed. </p> <p>Gyngell always remained Australia's golden media boy. He was born in Melbourne, and inherited some pretty extraordinary genes. His great grandfather was the pyrotechnician for the wedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, while his grandfather, who settled in Australia, introduced cider-making to the continent. His father ran a flying circus before becoming an engineer with Mobil, and his mother was of Irish extraction. </p> <p>He attended the private Sydney Grammar School and briefly studied medicine at the city's medical school. But he took time out to work as a disc jockey for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, joined the university air squadron and was desolate when the Korean war ended before he had a chance of action. He stayed at ABC until he was 22, when Sir Frank Packer, the newspaper tycoon took a shine to him and offered him a job with Consolidated Press. Packer then won one of the first two licences for commercial television. Gyngell fixed himself up with a two-year traineeship in New York. </p> <p>At NBC and Columbia University, he fell in love with television, and returned to Australia: on September 16 1956, he opened Packer's network with the words: \"Good evening and welcome to television.\" </p> <p>In a 10-year stint, he made Channel 9 the most successful network. He got married for the first time, to Ann Barr, and had three children. But, in a pattern that was to repeat itself, he walked out of his job in a row over money and autonomy. He was wooed by the rival Channel 7, with more money and a Bentley - Gyngell loved the good things of life, and was always immaculately dressed. </p> <p>Then he switched to Lew (later Lord) Grade's ATV in Britain, and backed such 1960s classics as The Golden Shot, Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased) and New Faces. Once again he took off when Grade refused to make him chairman. Back home in Australia, he was offered the chairmanship of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, started an ethnic aboriginal channel, and by the early 1980s had become absorbed with eastern ideas - Zen Buddhism, meditation and the Insight philosophy. </p> <p>For much of his latter life he followed a macrobiotic diet - even when entertaining at the Savoy. He believed in the power of positive thinking. And he was always very superstitious. At the time of the franchise renewal, staff wore company watches and key fobs, and were supposed to rub them to channel positive forces. </p> <p>This eccentric streak became ever more pronounced as the success of TV-am allowed him to dictate what went on. The call from Kerry Packer to sort out TV-am, which he had described as a \"load of old crap\", had made him the UK's highest paid television executive, at \u00a3193,000 a year. </p> <p>In 1986, he married again, this time Kathy Rowan, a TV-am producer, and started a second family, with two sons, Adam (now at Eton) and Jamie. After the licence was handed to GMTV, he toyed with alternatives, but soon returned to Australia, to lick his wounds, and run Channel 9 for two years. He also helped to launch the first World Summit on Children's Television, now a regular biennial fixture. </p> <p>But this familar maverick did not stay away from Britain for long. He bounced back in 1995, as chief executive of a bruised Yorkshire Television (in an odd double act with its chairman, Ward Thomas), later absorbed by Granada. </p> <p> F or a man whose private language and jokes could be salty in the extreme, he then pulled another surprise, by turning into a moral guardian. Gyngell was appalled first by tacky late night ITV schedules, and then by a prime-time series, Hollywood Lovers, which had segments on the \"mile-high club\" and plastic surgery for genitalia. He refused to show these programmes in the Yorkshire region, and ran Whicker's World Turns Again repeats instead. </p> <p>Two years later, as ITV companies converged, he went into semi-retirement, with homes in Chelsea and Dorset, but with positions at Channel 9 and its holding company, PBC Holdings. It was only in April 2000, as news of his illness spread, that the man who had made such an impact on British television was honoured with a fellowship for lifetime achievement by the Royal Television Society. Many thought it shocking that he had been overlooked for so long. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife and five children: his son David and daughters Bryony and Sky from his first marriage, and his two sons from his second. </p> <p>\u0095 Bruce Gyngell, broadcasting executive, born July 8 1929; died September 7 2000</p>",
  "On the day \"company doctor\" David James turned up to inspect his new patient, the assistant at the dome box office offered him an OAP discount. \"I thought I looked about 18,\" James joked. \"I work out in the gym every morning at 5.15 for an hour and a quarter. I'm in pretty good shape.\" <p>Like the 90 dying businesses he claims to have saved, there is not much fat on James. Nor - if you listen to those at the sharp end of those rescues - much room for sentiment either. </p> <p>Though he claims to have saved 25,000 jobs, occasionally, as in the case of Dan-Air, the patient has not survived his radical surgery. </p> <p>\"We saw him as an undertaker rather than a doctor,\" said one union negotiator who dealt with him there. \"He's bloody good but he's not a miracle worker. He is interested only in figures. Emotion, sentiment, compassion - I saw none.\" </p> <p>James, 62, dislikes the \"company doctor\" tag , with its overtones of the ruthless surgeon, and prefers to be called a crisis manager. As for Dan-Air, he claims he saved some jobs and helped make Gatwick more than a \"bucket and spade airport\". </p> <p><b> Unflappable</b><br> </p> <p> There is, however, a telling story about a photograph he keeps on his desk of the diving support vessel British Argyll, which almost sank one of his toughest cases, North Sea Assets. </p> <p>\"That ship was the last built at Smith's yard on Teesside,\" said James. \"Any tear-jerking stories you ever hear about the poor workers of Sunderland do not take account of the dreadful manner in which that ship was built. It was supposed to be state of the art but turned out to be defective in every respect. It was supposed to be built for \u00a312.4m but cost \u00a342m.\" </p> <p>What you must remember, one of his closest colleagues said, is that when \"David comes in, more often than not, those involved haven't admitted the truth of the situation to themselves. What he does is blow away the bullshit. </p> <p>\"He is a pretty unflappable guy. David has stared down the barrel of a gun and held his nerve.\" Quite literally. </p> <p>In 1986, James - who had been hired to rebuild the engineering group now called TransTec - flew to Tripoli to free a dozen staff working for one of its subsidiaries on a project for the Libyan navy. They had been taken hostage by revolutionary guards. But James was himself held for six days - while the Americans bombed the base, calling it a \"legitimate terrorist target\" - before negotiating the return of all the men. </p> <p>It was through another gun - Saddam Hussein's supergun, and his key role in exposing it - that a decade ago James first made the transition from the business pages to the front pages. The affair also cemented his close links with the security services. As the Scott report into arms sent to Iraq makes clear, James did much of the legwork for MI6. </p> <p><b> Assassinated</b><br> </p> <p> He first noticing the gun's three huge steel tubes, \"the thinnest of which had a thumping great muzzle, like something from a strip cartoon siege gun\", during a tour of Walter Somers' factory at Halesowen in the West Midlands. </p> <p>A week after he passed his suspicions on to an MI6 contact called Mr Q, Gerald Bull, the supergun's Canadian designer, was assassinated in Brussels. </p> <p>James later used his banking contacts to track down the rest of the weapon, which was supposed to fire anthrax shells into Israel, before it left Teesport docks. Part of this cloak-and-dagger operation involved him getting 900 documents from Walter Somers' offices which were photographed secretly through the night with MI6 equipment set up in a room at a Halesowen hotel. </p> <p>With such a gripping CV, it is hardly surprising that he has been courted by more than one publisher for the story of his life. </p> <p>He is not immune to vanity, and admits to have \"a fairly large City fan club\". The only son of a working class cook - born within a mile of the dome - he seems to have had a point to prove. \"When I left school at 18 I did not go to Oxford because we could not afford the \u00a31,500 it would have taken to keep me there for three years. Now I can earn that sort of money between breakfast and lunch.\" </p> <p>Despite this unabashed self-confidence, there is something in his mix of candour, unshakable competence and quick dry wit which makes people instinctively warm to him. </p> <p><b> Firefighter</b><br> </p> <p> When he was sent in to sort out Eagle Trust, the empire built by the convicted fraudster John Ferriday, Devon farmer Malcolm Simons complained he had pocketed \u00a32.8m fees over six years. Sir John Harvey-Jones would have been cheaper, he said. </p> <p>James replied that after deducting the cost of his office, secretary, car, driver, pension and other overheads he was left with \"just\" \u00a31.5m. \"I think you'll find he (Harvey-Jones) is even more expensive than you think I am.\" </p> <p>He is certainly a safer pair of hands than his namesake, the equally expensive Aston Villa goalkeeper, nicknamed Calamity James. This David James has his own sobriquet, too - the City's Red Adair, after the Texan who tackles oil well fires. </p> <p>Stories of his stamina and 80-hour weeks have passed into legend in the Square Mile. </p> <p>He once worked non-stop for 48 hours at Dan-Air, and later in the space of a few days crisscrossed the globe between London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, and back before booking himself into hospital for the night for surgery. He was at his desk the next morning, and rounded off his day with a three-mile run in Hyde Park. James is not a big one for holidays. \"I have had the odd weekend in Venice but I have never had a proper holiday abroad. In business I have travelled so much that the last thing I want to do when I'm relaxing is to go a long distance.\" </p> <p>That said, he has been known to fly to Sydney to see the whole of a Test match, and allocates himself three sacrosanct weeks a year off to pit his fabled powers of risk analysis against the bookies at Ascot, Goodwood and Cheltenham race courses. </p> <p>Marriage though, never got a look in. \"I never intended to be a bachelor,\" he said. \"When I could have married I felt I was too poor, and when I had enough, I was too busy. Now I am too old.\" </p> <p>So what drives this human dynamo to such Stakhanovite excesses in late middle age is something of a mystery. </p> <p>He lives relatively modestly for a multi-millionaire, between a home in central London and one in Hove close to the cricket ground. Glyndebourne, the home of his other great passion, opera, is only down the road. (He turned around the English Symphony Orchestra just for fun after a major problem with funds). Even his offices in Victoria are \"a bit of a broom cupboard\". It is the sheer kick of salvaging the seemingly unsalvageable that appears to turn him on. </p> <p>Asked why he agreed to take on the dome, when he is already chairman of the Robinson Group and a member of Lloyd's regulatory board, James fired back: \"Like Everest, it's there. You've got to climb it.\" </p> <p>Nor is he being paid, of course. A knighthood being worth so much more, presumably, and a peerage priceless.</p>",
  "<p>America's preoccupation with other countries' long-range weapons is behind the design of a new anti-missile system, which congress is likely to approve for deployment later this year. In principle, it is temptingly simple. Hostile missiles blast off, fly round the earth, then come down again on target. All you have to do is intercept them after they have gone up, but before they come down. </p> <p>In practice, it will be incredibly difficult. Earlier efforts to develop particle beams came to nothing, so the current schemes call for ground-launched missiles to catch the missiles. They will have to be more accurate than missiles have ever been before. The Pentagon reckons this can be done. Incoming missiles are likely to be moving at upwards of five kilometres per second. But the interceptors need carry no warhead. They can be smaller, lighter and easier to manoeuvre. </p> <p>They would detect the incomers using a complex combination of sensors, based on existing technology. Ground-based radar and satellites with heat sensors would show up enemy missile launches. They would give a good enough prediction of their path to launch interceptors in the right direction. Then heat and light sensors would be used to control small rockets on the final stage of the defending missile and send it into high-speed collision. The enemy weapon would be disintegrated high above the atmosphere. </p> <p>So far, so reassuring. But also much too optimistic, critics argue. The reason is that there will not just be the warhead hurtling through space. If the hostile party knows there are interceptors, they will modify their own missiles. Mounting a defence against intercontinental ballistic missiles assumes an enemy capable of building them and loading them with nuclear bombs. So it seems reasonable to infer that whoever it is, they can deploy counter-measures which would be technically simpler than making an ICBM in the first place. </p> <p>And since an anti-missile system really has to be 100% effective, the advantage lies with the attacker. Up above the atmosphere, heavy and light objects follow the same trajectories. So it would be easy to make decoys which cluster round the nuclear warhead and confound the interceptor. A nuclear warhead is heavy and warm, but it would not be too hard to disguise it, cool its outer surface, or even make all the decoys resemble a warhead. The putative nuclear attacker also has the option of building low-flying, sea-launched missiles, or even smuggling the odd warhead to its target overland. </p> <p>Unlikely, perhaps, but then nuclear deterrence has always traded on pretty unlikely scenarios. The anti-missile defence programme assumes an American president rejecting nuclear blackmail from a newly armed opponent secure in the knowledge that US cities are under a defensive umbrella. A little thought suggests that he or she can never be sure that the umbrella will not be leaky, or that the enemy strike will not come in underneath it. </p>",
  "<p>Thirteen years after the Smiths broke up, Johnny Marr still fascinates: the 500-capacity Scala in London is crammed with punters, not to mention celebrities. Noel Gallagher is here (I thought Meg was the one who kept wanting to go out?), as is his brother Liam - together with current main squeeze Nicole Appleton. Bernard Butler of Suede you'd expect to see, but even legendary 1970s scene-maker Rodney Bingenheimer has come to check out the Healers, Marr's first band proper in more than a decade. </p> <p>Against the sort of budget psychedelic backdrop usually seen in end-of-term school plays, the six musicians assume their positions. Despite counting in their ranks a son of a Beatle (Zak Starkey on drums) and a former member of retro-rockers Kula Shaker (Alonza Bevan on bass), it is Marr in the role of group leader that people have come to see. </p> <p>He looks cool enough, despite being one month away from his 37th birthday, even if you suspect he probably made a better moody sidekick than a charismatic frontman. As to whether or not he can sing, you'd hardly know, because whatever comes out of his mouth is immediately swallowed up by the music (that the PA is so loud it's distorting doesn't help). The promotional CD doing the rounds, featuring a track called Last Ride, reveals a functional rock voice with, oddly enough, a tone reminiscent of Status Quo's Francis Rossi. </p> <p>The first two numbers, Bangin' On and the aforementioned Last Ride, are impressive. In fact, if the Oasis songwriter wasn't such a close friend of his, you could almost imagine Marr thinking \"Suck on this, Noel\" as he unleashes wave after wave of pulverising sound. Because this sort of heavy psychedelic blues-metal (\u00e0 la Led Zeppelin or the second Stone Roses album) is roughly what Standing on the Shoulder of Giants might have sounded like had Gallagher and Co managed to sustain the impact of that album's opening instrumental, Fuckin' in the Bushes. A contradiction in terms, perhaps, but this is stoner rock with energy. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the rest of the gig presents mostly variations on that theme. Here It Comes and Caught Up are as pedestrian as their titles. During Down on the Corner, the Healers appear to be doing little more than jamming - filling up the periods when Marr is away from the mike with indelicate musical passages. Even fans of instrumental proficiency would decry the lack of finesse, the pointless reiteration, the bongo solos. </p> <p>In a recent interview, Marr declared his intention that the Healers should be some holy union of T Rex, the Stooges, Santana and the Wailers, which is to suggest all manner of rhythmical delights and sonic tricks. He even intimated that keyboardist Lee Spencer (former collaborator of William Orbit) would bring a sense of electronic mischief to bear on the Healers' sound. </p> <p>He doesn't - at least not tonight. Indeed, there is little acknowledgement of musical developments of the past 10 or 20 years. Ironically, Marr arguably did his best work since the Smiths with Electronic, his dance-pop venture with Bernard Sumner of New Order. No doubt he sees all his session-playing with the Pretenders, Roxy Music, The The and Kirsty MacColl as leading up to this. We always knew he had it in him: the desire to rock out, the musical equivalent of dumbing down. </p> <p>Only the looped drum beat underpinning Voodoo in You changes the pace. The glam-metal stomp of Iggy and the Stooges' I Need Somebody provides a pleasant enough blow to the skull, but that song was so bound up in Iggy's mythos that tonight it is stripped of its meaning. Marr is no Iggy, no Dylan, no Lou Reed, no Neil Young. He will never transcend his era or face the fierce white light/white heat of critical significance again. He's just jamming.</p>",
  "The paradox of having a garden is that they are the best places for slowing down, but keeping them looking good involves more or less constant activity. This is not to say that some gardens aren't better than others at helping you unwind. <p>Ancient tradition thought of the garden as an oasis in the desert with walls to keep out the world and lush plants irrigated by sacred springs within. Broadly speaking, this is the basic plan of the Paradise garden, which persisted for centuries, and the idea of the walled garden as a place for relaxation - and, traditionally, erotic trysts - is one carved deep into the gardening psyche. </p> <p>Niwa, the Japanese word for garden, means \"an enclosure purified for the worship of the gods\", conjuring up the idea of a quiet, protected place for peaceful contemplation; in this case, the atmosphere of calm is usually achieved by austere simplicity. But if you don't fancy this pure and Zen-like route to balance, you could still go for the design trick of a sense of enclosure, which is common to many traditions - a sanctuary that will be your own private domain. </p> <p>In this respect, urban gardens are an ideal base to work from. They are often already surrounded by walls; and if not, then the small size of the average back yard for once is an advantage because it makes it easier and more affordable to screen it off with fences, trellis or climbing plants. Once you've got the sense of enclosure, then gateways, for example, become loaded with mental resonances, as well as being practical. Beds, borders and edgings then complement the picture. </p> <p>Two designers from different backgrounds have both published books on the subject of the garden as a kind of inner sanctum. In The Inward Garden (Little, Brown, \u00a327.50), the American Julie Moir Messervy, who was inspired by the traditional gardens of Japan, talks about seven primary elements of the garden - the grove, hut, enclosure, threshold, meadow, mount and spring - and how they can be represented in a small domestic space. A \"hut\" can be a garden bench backed by a tree, for example, or a \"bridge\" can be a simple granite slab over a rill, and still have resonance in a scaled-down landscape. </p> <p>In his book, Portfolio Of Contemporary Gardens (Quadrille, \u00a325), the British designer Stephen Woodhams shows how using symbolic elements - bleached stones and semi-succulents to represent a desert garden, for instance - can evoke a wider landscape, and how setting a garden apart both in time and space, and personalising it, gives it restorative powers beyond the pleasures of simply being outside doing nothing. </p> <p>Both designers recommend water as the most powerful element influencing the atmosphere of a garden. The sound of a fountain trickling into a stone basin cools and relaxes, and the energy of water always seeking its lowest level is deeply satisfying, especially as a strong, constant flow. </p> <p>Huge water extravaganzas, such as the Villa d'Este at Tivoli, the Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn gardens in Paris, or the amazing water chutes of the gardens of Nishat Bagh, in Kashmir, give the impression that you need a generous space and budget if you're going to use such features in a garden. But a rill a few centimetres wide, flowing down a set of six brick steps and into a small pool in a quiet corner of the Alhambra Palace gardens, in Granada, Spain, shows how the narrowest stream of water can add animation and life. </p> <p>Still water works well, too. Pools, especially if they are sunlit, produce calming reflections that can be intensified if the lining is painted in a dark colour such as black or green. Always aim for a sense of abundance when using water, as in those swimming pools that gently overflow their edges. </p> <p>Another designer, Christopher Bradley Hole, uses a rigid steel lining in pools, so that the water level is flush with the surrounding paving. But for abundance without building work, a beautiful, wide-necked pot filled to the brim and regularly topped up gives the equivalent effect. </p> <p>One garden, in Catford, south London, shows how enclosure, water and simple shapes can work together to make a calm place without being a burden to maintain. The owners, Francis and Kirstin O'Connor, work irregular hours as a theatre designer and a doctor, and since their time off rarely coincides, they wanted to make sure they spent it relaxing rather than doing the gardening. With this brief, Andrew Mitchell, of the Vivid Space design group, built them a decking \"stage\" on which to eat out and entertain friends. </p> <p>In answer to the question whether decking is suitable for the British climate, Mitchell points out that this one is made from English oak, which does not get slippery when wet. He has planed it for a smooth finish and nailed it to joists as you would a floor, using rust-free, stainless-steel nails, so it's solid like a boat deck. </p> <p>The deck has now weathered to a silvery-grey colour, and is surrounded by raised beds of spiky phormiums, bamboo and, in summer, a hot border of purple basil and crocosmia; there's also a pond in one corner. The couple asked a horticulturalist friend, Simon Auton, for a planting scheme that would leave a few pockets of space that they could fill in with their own favourites. Auton tried to steer them towards having more space for plants and, in retrospect, Francis says it's the one thing they would do differently if they went through the process again. </p> <p>This is a good compromise between being a slave to your garden and going for the minimalist \"low maintenance\" style that's high on concrete and Perspex, but low on live plants. And in any case, it's debatable whether this really does cut down on work. As garden designer Chris Maton says, \"Though contemporary-style gardens are low maintenance in the traditional sense - low weeding and low watering - they involve more maintenance in the upkeep of materials. You end up treating metals, for instance, or cleaning glass. I always tell my clients that truly low maintenance is difficult to achieve.\" </p> <p>There is a conflict in this talk of serenity-inducing gardens, because they inevitably involve getting the builders in. It's not ideal, but remember: after the work is done, you really don't have to do a thing, because if you really hate gardening, you can always get a gardener.</p> <p><b>Tranquil tips</b></p> <p>1 Choose plants that like the conditions you've got - soil, aspect, etc - so you don't have to nurse them. </p> <p>2 Check out websites such as <a href=\"http://www.spidergarden.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.spidergarden.com</a> or <a href=\"http://www.dig-it.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.dig-it.com</a> for off-the-peg planting schemes. </p> <p>3 Go for repeat planting rather than scores of different varieties - it's much easier on the eye. </p> <p>4 Eliminate bare patches in borders and the lawn so that weeds don't have a chance to get established. </p> <p>5 Get rid of the lawn - it's a lot of work to keep it looking good, and there are more interesting surfaces about. </p> <p>6 Let the worms do the work and use mulches to feed plants and improve soil structure. </p> <p>7 Hoe up weeds before they set seed in spring - it will cut down on weeding for the rest of the year. </p> <p>8 Buy 'young plants' (annual flowers and veg) in modules by mail order, rather than mess about sowing seeds. </p> <p>9 Avoid lots of small container plantings - especially if you haven't much time to water them. </p> <p>10 Have fences rather than hedges: no need to explain which one is more work.</p>",

  "<p>'I make the time,' declares Dr Demetrios Matsakis, 'so I can do what I want with it.' He's only slightly joking - if anyone runs the world's time, it's Dr Matsakis. He is Director of Time Standards at the US Navy's Directorate of Time - the hours, minutes and nanoseconds on the 60 atomic clocks at his laboratory in Washington DC provide the official source of time for the Department of Defense (and therefore the network of Global Positioning Satellites) and the standard of time for the US. He is the world's top time lord. And, today he's in the time centre of Britain - and no, it's not Greenwich. </p> <p>It's been many years since Greenwich really made the time. If you want to find the clock capital of Britain now, you have go to Teddington, Middlesex, to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), where Dr John Laverty and his team of eight scientists check the three caesium clocks that send out the national radio time signal from Rugby. NPL's signal is used by government and companies such as Railtrack (all station clocks in Britain are timed with NPL, 'although we can't make the trains run on time,' says Dr Laverty). </p> <p>Under international agreement, world time actually comes together at S\u00e8vres, just south-west of Paris, at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). There, an average is taken from 200 atomic clocks in labs around the world. Each month, a report is sent back to the time labs such as NPL or Washington to let them know how close their clocks are to the average. 'If I'm 10 nanoseconds out, we have a problem,' says Dr Matsakis. However, as his lab provides 60 atomic clocks - approximately 40% of the world total compared with the UK's 3 or 4% - he can, of course, set the average. Why does it matter? GPS [Global Positioning Systems] satellites, for instance, are time-coordinated - and if one is even a nanosecond out, you could miss by feet. </p> <p>It's certainly a weird career area. 'I was a real child of the space age,' says 50-year-old Dr Matsakis, who grew up with one eye peering through a telescope at the stars and has just been voted vice-chair of the prestigious International Astronomical Union's commission on time. </p> <p>They get together every few months at time conventions to write equations on the back of napkins and discuss projects, such as 'redefining the second'. This is important because the world is not as exact as the atomic clock, and often moves faster or slower - at present, every so often 'leap seconds' are inserted into the year. </p> <p>'The thing about time,' says Dr Laverty, at 36, a relative newcomer, 'is that everyone is so young - even when they're close to retirement'. They each have their own pet projects. For Dr Matsakis, it's 'finding the best way to average all clocks. It's the holy grail of time.' </p> <p>NPL is now a 'GOCO' centre in the jargon of Whitehall, ie, Government Owned, Contractor Operated. The time has officially been privatised. But ask Dr Matsakis if the US Navy would sell off the time and he is adamant. 'No way,' he says. 'They need the time. Things have to work. If there's a war on they don't need some peacenik not giving them the time... ' Are they ever late? 'My personal timekeeping is pretty awful, actually,' Dr Laverty admits.</p>",
  "The Italian countryside is a regular holiday haunt for thousands of Britons - it's the slow tempo of life that draws visitors to the small sleepy towns. But for local people, things are moving just a bit too fast with the pace of modern living simply not leaving enough time for life's essentials. Now a nationwide campaign is underway to keep the 21st century at bay. <p>Orvieto is a city in no hurry. From its table-top position above the Umbrian countryside, it sits protected from the stresses of life - there has never been an earthquake, it's never been bombed and the city has never suffered a major fire. One of Italy's oldest cities, it attracts thousands of tourists every year, won over by its beauty and tranquillity. </p> <p>But even here it seems, life is a beat too fast and Orvieto is fighting back. It's joining forces with more than 30 towns and cities across Umbria and Tuscany - in the Citta Slow or Slow City movement. </p> <p>'A slowing up would improve the quality of our life here,' says Louisa Borgna, one of the leaders of the Citta Slow campaign. 'It's not that we don't want progress, but we want to try to control the speed at which things are moving.' </p> <p>Campaigners say that the movement isn't fuelled by nostalgia. They don't want to be seen as anti-technology or scared of the future. They say it is about having the all- important time and space to enjoy life's pleasures. The Citta Slow movement is a code of conduct, a form of self regulation for Umbria and Tuscany. 'To be a Citta Slow, people must place an emphasis on respecting and preserving cultural traditions,' says Louisa Borgna. 'Using modern inventions like electric buses can help prevent pollution, and we'll use our cars less often, too. We should also make an effort to keep the town beautiful and clean.' </p> <p>Residents are also being asked to grow sweet-smelling plants and flowers in their gardens to ensure the aroma and look of rural Italy is as idyllic as possible. The campaign has won the backing of local people keen to ensure Orvieto retains the charm so enjoyed by tourists. </p> <p>The Foresi family owns a wine cellar in the main square, which was dug by hand underneath the city 700 years ago. Its owner, Gianluca Foresi, says, 'Citta Slow is about not concentrating on time. It's about enjoying every minute, every bite of each day.' </p> <p>Born and brought up in Orvieto, Signor Foresi says Citta Slow is the best thing that could have happened to his home town. 'You can just sit in the sun and not worry about your work, your business, your problems and your troubles. You might say we're living in a fairy-tale.' </p> <p>\u0095 Daniela Relph was in Orvieto for BBC News 24.</p>",
  "Jeanette Winterson asserts that men are less self-conscious and therefore more free. She has obviously not witnessed the average British male on a dancefloor, or seen a teenager agonising about which trainers he can be seen wearing at school, or the rare sighting of a househusband looking uncomfortable at a coffee morning. As a househusband myself, I have found that, just to be comfortable getting through a day, one has to be 'single-minded' and unselfconscious to a degree that is beyond most males. <br> <b> Paul Humber</b> <br> Cambridge <p>Libby Brooks's description of Jeanette Winterson's birthplace as 'near Manchester' without naming the well-known town (Accrington) is yet another example of the London-based media's ignorance (possibly deliberate) of the geography of northern England. </p> <p>Accrington is a town with a population of more than 30,000, so it is hardly a small hamlet unknown outside the immediate area. It is more than 20 miles from Manchester and is, in fact, closer to several large towns such as Burnley and Blackburn (whose football team I seem to remember winning the premiership title recently), than it is to what seems the only place in the north-west (Manchester) of which people living south of Watford have heard. </p> <p>Presumably, we northerners can henceforth describe such places as St Albans and Luton as 'near London', rather than affording them the dignity of being called by their proper name. <br> <b> Peter Atkinson</b> <br> Richmond, North Yorkshire </p> <p>In common with many commentators on the topic, Julie Burchill misses the fundamental point.

  "<p>It's early Sunday morning in SoHo, and downtown New York is beginning to wake up. On the wooden benches in front of Jean Claude's, a restaurant so rough-hewn and thoroughly French that it might have been airlifted from Aix-en-Provence, bleary-eyed punters are sifting lazily through the mammoth New York Times. </p> <p>Turning down Prince Street, Tan Dun, China's best-known contemporary composer, looks every inch the archetypal SoHo inhabitant. Despite just stepping off a long flight from Beijing, he looks rested and relaxed, ambling along in sandals with abrown paper bag tucked under his arm: \"Not many Asian artists really love or even experience this kind of environment,\" he says, pointing out various \"hot\" galleries hidden behind the postindustrial facades of the buildings. \"Of all of my generation who moved to the States, I am the only person really working and living in New York as a normal New Yorker. I don't have any distance with the local people here. The culture is my culture. This is my home...\" </p> <p>Yet Tan Dun's origins couldn't lie further away from this modish corner of Manhattan. Over breakfast in his minimalist white-on-white apartment, he slips a cassette into the VCR, a documentary account for Chinese TV of his recent research trip to Hunan, the rural district of China where he was born and spent his early life. </p> <p>In the opening shot, framed against a lake and a traditional Chinese wooden pavilion, he announces: \"The most important thing in our lives is always to keep thinking about where we came from. Only then will we know where we are going.\" He goes on to detail a childhood immersed in the \"shamanism and magic\" of a rural village, an adolescence toiling in the rice fields during Mao's Cultural Revolution and a musical background so suffused with Chinese folk values that until the age of 20 he had \"never heard uttered the names of Beethoven, Mozart or Bach\". The camera pans across jagged, mist-enshrouded mountains. It cuts to a lavishly costumed Taoist ceremony performed by octogenarian monks. The monks play \"sheng\" mouth organs, elaborate bamboo instruments that issue a dank, sweet whine, and \"po\" hand cymbals, which work up a delightful clatter. The finale is the \"feast of 100 dishes\", in which every family in the village brings along a course, and on the screen Tan, now tipsy on home-made wine, sings comically with the local schoolgirl choir. </p> <p>Tan Dun's journey between these two contrasting worlds - Hunan Province and NY State, as far east and west as it is possible to travel culturally and spiritually - is perhaps one of the most extraordinary success stories in modern classical music. From what he says was a starting point of blissful ignorance of the international canon, Tan has now established himself as one of the most sought-after composers in the world. From entertaining peasants in the auditorium of the rice field, he has graduated to some of music's most prestigious venues: Lincoln Centre, Carnegie Hall, the Barbican. </p> <p>The same global cultural contrasts are evident in Tan Dun's remarkably diverse body of music, which Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu has described as \"violent as a burst of human blood, yet full of grace\". From Hunan comes the palette of sounds and timbres, the traditional Chinese instruments and the incantatory, contorted vocal techniques, employed to powerful effect in works such as the ritual opera Nine Songs. From urban New York we get the hip-hop rhythms, industrial guitars and samplers that propelled his hi-tech, thrash-aesthetic reinterpretation of Peony Pavilion, the classic 16th-century kunju opera. Hunan again provides the philosophical underpinnings, particularly the Taoist view of art as \"reverberations with the vital forces in nature\". Meanwhile, from the urban wellspring of New York comes the pure spirit of downtown experimentalism so evident in Soundshape and The Pink. \"What is very little heard in European or western music is the presence of sound as the voice of nature,\" commented John Cage, who was a huge influence on Tan's early US work. \"It is clear in the music of Tan Dun that sounds are central to the nature in which we live but to which we have too long not listened. In Tan Dun's music, the east and the west come together as our one home.\" </p> <p>Finally, from its sheer diversity, and the necessity of communicating to listeners perched on the very extremities of human civilization, comes Tan Dun's mass appeal. His Heaven Earth Mankind (Symphony 1997), commissioned for the Hong Kong handover, was made into a video for MTV. And his soundtrack for Ang Lee's Chinese-language film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival - has already shifted 200,000 copies in the east. </p> <p>His place on the global music stage is confirmed by the Tan Dun Festival which opens at the Barbican on September 28. Entitled Fire Crossing Water, it will feature UK premieres of his new work Water Passion as well as the score to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. </p> <p>However, the reaction to his work has been far from universally positive. Some Chinese composers have dismissed him as \"not serious\". The New York Times has printed scathing reviews, many of them by the music critic Bernard Holland, who has written: \"He is like the proverbial boy locked in a pastry shop, gorging indiscriminately on everything around him.\" Tan Dun responds: \"He says that I am always trying to mix wine and beer. I think he is crazy. Eventually we will all realise one day that there never were any boundaries, except those of man. All music is created by God.\"</p> <p> But Tan's moments of solemnity are usually immediately undermined by a mischievous streak: \"He's always been a spontaneously funny guy,\" says director Ang Lee, who has known him since the late 1980s. \"Whereas most of the other Asians in New York were generally quite shy and reserved, he could keep you entertained for hours singing some hilarious Hunan village song about how the farmer was feeling up the pigs and stroking their tits.\" He is also an excellent raconteur: \"Often you will find yourself going for lunch with Tan Dun,\" says Avril MacRory of the BBC, which co-commissioned his 2000 Today: A World Symphony for the Millennium, \"and returning at nine or 10 in the evening.\"</p> <p> However, Tan Dun's playful, imaginative ability to turn any situation into an entertaining anecdote has also earned him criticism. While his stories of shamanistic culture are voraciously devoured by those who have known him only in the west, many of his more cross-cultural acquaintances mutter about \"exaggeration\" and \"embellishment\". \"Tan Dun is a completely urban person,\" says Zhou Long, a fellow composer who has known him since his early days at the Beijing conservatory. \"He's not really from the village. He is from Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province. Sometimes, when you do promotion, you make stories. There is nothing wrong with that. If you are writing some biographical notes you can do that.\" </p> <p>There would seem to be a certain amount of evidence to support this view. One example might be the Chinese TV documentary, which was shot not in his home locality but deep in the countryside, a plane journey away. The actual village where Tan Dun spent some of his childhood has long since been swallowed up by the Changsha suburbs. Tan Dun's reaction to these assertions is both conciliatory and indignant: \"Perhaps they are right. Perhaps I am an urban person. I did spend some of of my time in the city. But anyone who says that I didn't also experience the culture of the countryside, then that is an insult to me and my background. They didn't come with me to live in a small village. They didn't come with me to be re-educated in the rice fields. How can they know how I lived my life?\" </p> <p>Tan Dun was born in 1957 in the central Chinese district of Hunan, the only son of Tan Xiang Qiu, a military officer in the People's Liberation Army, and Fang Qun Ying, then a doctor working in a Hunanese hospital. In the traditional manner, his first name, Dun, meaning \"shield\", comes last, though in the west he likes to be casually referred to as Tan. While his official publisher's biography - reproduced in most articles and interviews - cites the precise birthplace as the village of Si Mao, according to his father, Tan Dun was actually born in a military hospital on the outskirts of Changsha, now a rather grimy industrial regional capital of more than a million people. As was common Chinese practice for a busy working couple, his father and mother sent young Tan Dun off to live with his grandmother in the satellite village of Si Mao Chung, about 20 miles outside the city centre. </p> <p>Tan Dun recalls the environment in the village as \"very barbaric, very shamanistic, very mystic, very sacred, filled with traditional art forms, poetry and music... Like all the people of Hunan, the villagers were very secretive, very strange and completely devoted to their secret beliefs.\" It was this mystical environment, he says, that provided him with his first musical experiences, primarily through esoteric local rituals.</p> <p> \"From the local people, I started learning how to play Chinese folk instruments, bamboo flutes and the 'erhu' two-string fiddle. It was very natural. Music was simply part of life, in local kunju theatre or shamanistic ritual, mostly at weddings and funerals.\" </p> <p>When he returned to the city, at what he says was the age of nine, his musical education continued when a teacher presented him with an decrepit old violin: \"It only had three strings and as I had no money to replace it, I treated it like a three-stringed fiddle.\" By now, however, Mao's cultural revolution was getting into full swing and soon Tan Dun's parents were sent off to be re-educated in the countryside, his father by cleaning out the animal sheds on a farm, his mother to become what was known as a \"barefoot doctor\" among the peasants. At the age of 17, Tan Dun followed them to be re-educated in the rice fields of the Huangjin commune, about 50 miles outside Changsha. </p> <p>Ironically, Mao's policy - which, Deng Xiaoping later said, caused \"grave misfortunes\" for China - turned out to be a real re-education for Tan Dun, who had now fully formed in his mind the ambition of one day becoming a composer: \"In the daytime I would be planting rice in the fields for 10 hours, 12 hours,\" he recalls. \"But in the evening I would direct all farmers in a kind of rural orchestra using their cooking pots and whatever else they can use. We had no money so most of our instruments were pots, branches of trees, bits of bamboo. I began also to collect many, many folk songs.\" </p> <p>After two years of backbreaking work on the commune, by a macabre stroke of luck for Tan, the entire orchestra of the Changsha Peking Opera were drowned in a boating accident and officials were sent out to the communes to recruit trained musicians. He spent a year fiddling his way up through the ranks of the orchestra, then the death of Chairman Mao brought the cultural revolution to an abrupt halt. As traditional educational establishments opened once more, Tan Dun was among the 40,000 applicants for places at the Beijing conservatory, with 400 competing for just eight places on the composers' course. </p> <p>The entrance exam lasted a full week and covered everything from mathematics to Marxist theory to orchestration and harmony: \"I'd never been trained. I was little more than a farmer; I had never seen a piano or any of those fancy instruments. So I did everything according to my first instinct.\" On the final day came the aural: \"The examining professor asked me to play some Mozart,\" says Tan. \"And I said, 'Who is Mozart?' And he shook his head and said, 'Ohhhh my God!' And then he said, 'All right. Play some Bach.' And I said, 'What? Bach? I never heard of Bach.' And he said, 'What about Beethoven?' And I said, 'Sorry, I cannot. I am from Hunan; I don't know who Beethoven is.' So I suggested that I just improvise a little and he said, 'OK'. I took out my violin, which had only three strings on it, and I improvised for an hour. He was really shocked. Then there was a really big debate. And against every professor in the selection committee, he argued that I should be taken on the course.\" </p> <p>This last anecdote is a particular favourite, repeated in various forms in interviews. Sometimes he improvises on his three-stringed violin for two hours, often as long as three. On other occasions he is even more versatile: \"They asked me to sing,\" he told one publication, \"and I could sing 300 folk songs from Hunan, Szechuan, Tibet, all over. They accepted me because I was a little shaman.\" </p> <p>How much actual \"shamanism and magic\" really went on in the village where he grew up with his grandmother is far from clear: singer Chen Shi-Zheng, who also grew up in Changsha, contends that \"every grandmother there is a shaman\", but Tan's fellow Beijing conservatory students, some of whom grew up in neighbouring regions, cast doubt on this. Chinese shamanism is much more strongly associated with the north of China and Mongolia. </p> <p>His father, Tan Xiang Qiu, confirms that it was in the village that Tan Dun's love of music was ignited and divulges that his son would continually play the violin \"until the skin under his jaw was hard and callused\". But in Tan Xiang Qui's account, his son returned to the city at the age of six, not nine as Tan claims, and he also paints a picture of influences rather less traditional and shamanistic. </p> <p>According to Tan Xiang Qiu, far from being primitive or ignorant, his son's traditional formal musical education was quite advanced for provincial China at that time: by the age of 14 he had mastered Chinese notation and a little later travelled to Beijing to meet the com poser Hua Lu Bin, expressly for the purpose of studying western music. It is difficult to believe that this quest for western musical knowledge might not have included at least some mention of Mozart or Bach. </p> <p>As for the infamous audition at the Beijing conservatory, the examining professor, Li Xian, who would go on to become Tan Dun's mentor, recalls none of the events or details mentioned in the anecdote; not the questions about Beethoven or Bach, nor the three-stringed violin, nor the one- to three-hour session of traditional improvisation: \"Two hours? No, that would have been impossible,\" he says stiffly. \"Each student was allocated a specific amount of time for the tests. The maximum would have been about 20 minutes.\" </p> <p>While Tan Dun actually gave a rather lacklustre performance at a very straightforward audition, it was his sparkling piano trio, the evocatively entitled I Dreamt of Chairman Mao, based on traditional Hunanese folk music, that earned him his place at the conservatory. </p> <p>So, in September 1978, he packed his belongings - \"a bamboo pole over my shoulder,\" he says, \"one side wrapped up with my clothes, on the other side my scores\" - and left Changsha to join the composers' class. Almost immediately, Tan was marked out by the eccentricity of his musical vision: \"He always used influences in his music from his own daily life,\" remembers Li Xian. \"He would use in his music the voice of the stones, or something falling on the floor, or a cup being struck: noises normal people don't manage to use or even hear. If someone crushed a can of drink in order to put it in the trash can, he would replicate the action to hear the noise again. Then he would introduce that sound into his music.\" </p> <p>After a visit in 1979 to China by a Japanese troupe who used traditional Japanese instruments to make contemporary music, Tan Dun began applying the same principle to Chinese instruments and music. One of the fruits of this approach was his first symphony Li Sao, inspired by a fourth century BC melancholic poem. The piece, whose title translates as On Encountering Sorrow, featured traditional instruments and caused some controversy. His next major work, the string quartet Feng Ya Song, came second in Dresden's Weber Prize, making Tan Dun the first Chinese com poser to win an international prize since 1949. The Dresden victory had an immediate effect on Tan's career, propelling him to the forefront of the \"new wave\" of Chinese composers, but his music was denounced by the state in its renewed campaign against \"spiritual pollution\". </p> <p>Once the political storm had passed, Tan Dun made a request to continue his studies at Columbia, and permission was granted. So, in 1986, he took a flight from Beijing to New York and touched down in what would become his adopted homeland. \"I took the subway from the airport to Manhattan,\" he recalls, \"and I immediately understood that it wasn't at all the place I had imagined. I saw many people in the subway car, and they were all different colours. I asked myself, 'What country is this?' \" </p> <p>However, Tan soon tired of Columbia University. \"I immediately wanted to get away from the kind of depressing, bitter, atonal, selfish and superintellectual post-post-whatever music I was being forced to write there.\" Columbia soon reciprocally tired of him, and the professors there display a simmering animosity towards him that continues to this day: \"He was actually a very nice guy. He was a very good raconteur and I remember he was telling me stories from China that were perfectly human and very entertaining,\" says Columbia lecturer Mario Davidovsky. \"But he was at that point enormously involved in promoting himself and his career. And he was much more interested in that than anything that might have been going on at the university.\" </p> <p>As Columbia was only paying his fees, he had to earn money to live. \"I worked in restaurants and played my fiddle on the streets of Greenwich Village. That was my biggest classroom and in some way it was very close to my village in China, with its ritual music and its religion.\" </p> <p>At the first opportunity, he moved from the university dormitories into the basement of a brownstone in Chinatown, began to attend cutting-edge performance works and gradually became part of an artistic Greenwich Village set that included Steve Reich, Philip Glass and Meredith Monk. It was also about this time that Tan Dun first met John Cage and his music became, as he puts it, \"Cagealised\": \"Though I had been using incidental noises and found instruments since I was living in the village, of course I never thought of it as avant garde. But he was doing what I had done in the countryside 20 years previously.\" </p> <p>When Tan Dun decided that he wanted to launch himself into this world, he turned to his landlady, Mary Scherbatskoy, who had previously been a producer of dance. \"He just asked me casually one day if I'd like to produce an opera. And he showed me the score, and it was quite astonishing. But of course, being Chinese he wanted a cast of thousands. Eventually, I got him down to nine.\" The piece, Nine Songs, also based on Chinese poetry, used traditional ceramic Chinese instruments and opened with an extended sample of Tan Dun's shamanistic wailing. It was a sensation when performed at the Pace Downtown Theatre in May 1989. </p> <p>Tan Dun went on to produce a number of experimental performance-based and dance pieces: Soundshape in 1990 at the Guggenheim Museum, which included an entire village orchestra cast in ceramic, and The Pink in 1993, which included a cast of naked dancers playing instruments constructed entirely out of paper or cardboard. It was at the last of these, in which Tan Dun also performed as the naked conductor, that he first met his future wife, Jane Huang, then editor of a New York-based Chinese fashion magazine: \"After the show we all went to a bar . . . Immediately, he began paying me a lot of attention - I had a stomach upset and he went to the trouble of trying to get the waitress to get me some milk. Then suddenly, he said to me, 'Would you like to come to Tibet with me?' I didn't know what to say, I was absolutely shocked. I had completely misheard the question and thought he said to me, 'Would you like to come to bed with me?' But in fact we did end up going to Tibet very soon afterwards. We wanted to get married in the mountains. It was a very quick romance.\" Because of laws barring overseas Chinese from marrying in China, they had to settle for a tower-block register office in Hong Kong. They now have an two-year-old son, Ian. </p> <p>By this time, Tan Dun's reputation was beginning to cross over into the mainstream. An association with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra was the catalyst for the Orchestral Theatre series, four instalments of experimental gimmickry (part II saw the audience join in with trance-like chanting) multimedia (part III was set against a newsreel ranging from the Beatles to Mao's revolution) and a full orchestral score. The Edinburgh Festival commissioned Tan Dun's phenomenal Marco Polo, which featured a \"postmodern\" libretto by New York Times music critic Paul Griffith in which Marco and Polo appear as two characters/singers representing the yin/yang, east/west boundaries of modern culture. </p> <p>\"I don't really have any great interest in the east and the west as a dialogue,\" Tan Dun says. \"What I am interested in is trying to find a single language and distinctive style that is made up of many, many cultures and that can reach from many different diverse cultures.\" It is ironic that, in pursuit of this goal, he feels he needs to play up the primitive aspects of his background to such a degree, though in fact, the emphasis of his biographical details probably says more about the need for modern composers to distinguish themselves as much in their press packs as in their work. </p> <p>However, Tan Dun will ultimately be judged not on his life story but on his music, and in this area he still has a great deal to offer: \"One of the things I like about pop music is its accessibility and power. There, music just becomes the art of dancing together, performing together. And I think that if you can find that same international communicable quality, and somehow combine it with a very distinct personality and a very local and a very, very inward point of view, then you can smash the world.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance</strong></p> <p><strong> Born:</strong> August 8 1957, Changsha, Hunan, China. </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Beijing conservatory, 1978-85; Columbia University, 1986-89. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> Jane Huang, 1994 (one son, Ian, aged two years). </p> <p><strong> Operas: </strong> Nine Songs, 1989; Marco Polo, 1993-4; Peony Pavilion, 1998; Tea Opera, to be premiered in 2001. </p> <p><strong> Orchestral works:</strong> Li Sao, 1979; Feng Ya Song, 1983; On Taoism, 1985; Orchestral Theatre I-IV, 1990-1999; Death and Fire: Dialogue with Paul Klee,1992; Ghost Opera (with Kronos quartet), 1995; Heaven Earth Mankind (Symphony 1997), 1997; 2000 Today: A World Symphony for the New Millennium, 1999; Water Passion after St Matthew, 2000. </p> <p><strong> Experimental performance work: </strong> Soundshape, 1990; Silent Earth, 1991; Jo-Ha-Kyu, 1992; The Pink, 1993. </p> <p><strong> Awards: </strong> Weber Prize, second place, 1983; Suntory Prize, 1992; Grawemeyer Award, 1998.</p>",
  "<p>These days nobody wisely leaves a football match before the final whistle. That would be rather like walking out on Psycho without discovering what was in the fruit cellar. </p> <p>Increasingly, it would seem, the game is saving its most dramatic moments until last. Already this season the Premiership has seen eight instances of 2-0 or 3-0 leads being lost, and in half of these matches the survivors have not found the net until the last 20 minutes or so. </p> <p>The latest examples occurred on Wednesday night, when Derby County found themselves 3-0 down at home to Middlesbrough with 22 minutes remaining but still forced a draw, while Arsenal scored twice in the last 14 minutes at Stamford Bridge to deny Chelsea the victory which a 2-0 lead had suggested would be theirs. </p> <p>The previous evening Tottenham, losing 2-0 to Everton just before half-time, had won 3-2. A fortnight ago Southampton held Liverpool to 3-3 at the Dell after G\u00e9rard Houllier's team had led 3-0 with just over a quarter-of-an-hour remaining and on the same afternoon, at Upton Park, West Ham wiped out Manchester United's 2-0 advantage with goals in the 86th and 89th minutes. </p> <p>When even the Premiership champions cannot hold a two-goal lead for the last few minutes it is clear that what was once an occasional oddity has become a trend. All right, Chelsea had suffered much the same against Arsenal last October, when a hat-trick from Nwankwo Kanu overturned their 2-0 lead in the last 15 minutes, but until recently teams with any sort of nous usually held what they had. </p> <p>Now it appears that the knack of winning matches, which was never just about scoring more goals, is becoming a forgotten art. It is as if the game itself is still in a state of shock following Manchester United's remarkable comeback in the 1999 European Cup final in Barcelona when Bayern Munich's 1-0 lead was overturned during three minutes of stoppage time. </p> <p>Whatever happened to the ability of winning sides to keep possession, slow the game down and employ all manner of artifice to consume time? The leading teams of the 70s and 80s - Leeds United, Liverpool and Everton, for example - were masters of the practice of chloroforming matches once they had established a firm grip on them. </p> <p>Part of the reason why this happens less often is that the laws of the game have either been changed or re-interpreted to make it harder for teams to waste a few seconds here and there. Liverpool regularly used Ray Clemence to instigate attacks but the pass back to the goalkeeper was also a useful delaying tactic. </p> <p>Now a goalkeeper no longer has this luxury unless a team-mate heads or chests the ball to him. The tempo of matches has speeded up considerably since this law was introduced and, while the consequences have been mixed, the loss of the back-pass as a wholly reliable outlet for a team under pressure is part of the reason for the increase in exciting finishes. </p> <p>So is the more liberal application of the offside law. Everton in their championship-winning seasons were even sharper than Liverpool in being able to step up at the right second to get an opponent flagged down. Tedious though this might have been to the spectacle, it was an organisational skill demanding good timing and concentration on the part of the defenders. </p> <p>Now, with the question of whether or not an attacker is interfering with play reduced to a lottery, no defence can afford to assume that a man in an offside position will in fact be given offside. As a result defenders find themselves covering more ground and making tired errors towards the end of a game. </p> <p>Looking back, the football of 30 years ago was defenders' utopia. It is hard to believe now that there was a period when it was assumed that an attacker through on goal could be brought down from behind, a yard outside the penalty area, with the offender receiving no more punishment than a free-kick because \"there was nothing else he could have done\". </p> <p>Even the minor time-wasting habits, such as kicking the ball out of play or arguing at free-kicks, are becoming less available. No sooner has a ball been whacked into the crowd than another is immediately to hand. And, slowly but surely, referees are applying the new rule which advances a free-kick 10 yards if there is dissent. </p> <p>Anything which produces a greater likelihood of goals being scored and makes it harder for teams to kill matches off is to be applauded. But too many easy goals cheapen the game and what is needed now is a new breed of defenders capable of taking all the recent changes to their trade on board and still making it difficult for opposing forwards to find a way through. </p> <p>George Graham, while welcoming his Tottenham team's recovery to beat Everton this week, was right to point out that overall the present defending in the Premiership is poor. Outstanding sides are invariably based on outstanding defences - witness the present French team - but, when Chelsea cannot hold a lead even with Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf in their back four there is clearly some way to go. </p> <p>In the meantime stout females with strong vocal chords have never had it so good.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson's feud with the BBC (he is, at present, not on speaking terms with either Match of the Day or Five Live) appeared to have taken a turn for the worse when the Old Trafford season ticket ordered by a senior man at the corporation's Manchester operation failed to materialise. </p> <p>Was it merely paranoia or was the Beeb's representative to conclude that Ferguson's legendary powers of control extended to the ticket office and that a statement was being made? </p> <p>Sadly for fans of conspiracy everywhere, it was the cock-up theory that held sway. The Beeb's man was escorted to his seat after flashing his passport at the turnstile and his ticket finally arrived a month into the season after what turned out to be an administrative oversight. </p> <p>And on the subject of relationships between fans and the world's richest club, the supporters' group, Shareholders United, has been in touch in response to a piece here a fortnight ago about the growing glasnost at Old Trafford. </p> <p>Two years ago SU was formed as a group to fight the Manchester United board's decision to sell the club to BSkyB. Now the new chief executive Peter Kenyon has not only turned up at one of the group's meetings but has agreed to pay for a postal ballot for the SU representative on his new fans' forum. </p> <p>Whatever next: elected members of the board?</p>",

  "<p>Demutualisation bonanzas could prove illusory for hundreds of thousands of Scottish Provident policyholders. They should look carefully at their documentation before planning how to spend the windfalls promised following Abbey National's swallowing up of the Edinburgh life insurer. </p> <p>They will also need to check just when their policy was issued - the rules for some older policies are more generous than for those issued over the past four and a half years. </p> <p>After being \"in play\" for some months, Scottish Provident finally threw in the mutuality towel this week when it said it was falling under the Abbey National umbrella where Glasgow-based life company Scottish Mutual has resided since 1992. </p> <p>Continuing as a mutual made little sense, it believes, especially as it now specialises in protection plans, such as life or critical illness cover, rather than traditional with-profits business. And while it will not publicly admit it, the other touted option - a stock market float - would not have succeeded due to the firm's relatively small size. </p> <p>Demutualising means policyholders lose out because they no longer own the entire with-profits fund. It has to be shared with outside investors - in this case Abbey National which will be paying \u00a31.8bn for the life company. </p> <p>In return for giving up their vote and part of their share in the proceeds, the 325,000 with profits shareholders will end up with windfalls averaging around \u00a34,500 - near enough the eventual level paid out last month by Scottish Widows and substantially ahead of the typical amount on offer from pensions specialist NPI. They will also receive a further \u00a31,500 on average in \"enhanced policy benefits\" - although just how holders will be made aware of this in these notoriously opaque funds is not clear. </p> <p>With-profits policyholders include those with pension plans - where sales to new investors stopped in 1997 - and endowment policies. Scottish Provident endowments were sold to back mortgages by independent financial advisers. </p> <p>The life insurance company is currently sending out review letters to homebuyers. It says \"an average number have a shortfall\". Scottish Provident stopped selling endowments late last year. According to Money Management, returns on 25-year policies maturing this year were below average. </p> <p>The typical \u00a34,500 payout may be improved - the Scottish Widows windfall went up as actuaries refined their sums. And that average amount will vary from a minimum \u00a3500 to a possible \u00a3100,000 plus for the very biggest long-term pension plans. </p> <p>A further 125,000 policyholders who have non-profits plans, such as unit linked investments into both pension and endowment plans, are members but will not lose financially when mutuality disappears. </p> <p>Investors in these funds will receive a flat \u00a3500 irrespective of the size of their holding. This is identical to the payout offered by Scottish Widows to their unit linked and non-profit customers. </p> <p>But around 350,000 Scottish Provident policyholders will get nothing. They have no membership rights, although it is doubtful if this was ever pointed out to them by the independent financial advisers (IFAs )who sell all Scottish Provident plans. </p> <p>The great majority of these - some 300,000 - have bought protection policies such as life, income replacement, critical illness and medical cover. </p> <p>These have all been sold under the \"Self Assurance\" label. Scottish Provident has been very successful in replacing pensions and endowment sales with IFA based sales of protection - it is by far the biggest supplier of these plans in the independent area. </p> <p>But oddly anyone who bought and still holds a protection policy sold before January 1996 counts as a member and will qualify for the flat \u00a3500 payment. </p> <p>Around a further 40,000 policyholders are also excluded from the \u00a32bn payment bonanza. They are holders of plans bought from the offshore arm - Scottish Provident International. This is legally a subsidiary of the with-profits fund so they do not have membership rights whatever policies they hold. </p> <p>Abbey National customers receive nothing, although shareholders could profit if the deal lives up to the promise. Abbey's 15m account holders could see cheaper life cover if Scottish Provident products are sold in branches at the same price as sales through IFAs, and if sales of Aberdeen unit trusts are routed through branches. </p> <p>Aberdeen, which is 39% owned by Scottish Provident, is being sacked in August 2002 as Scottish Provident's main fund manager in favour of the Abbey National in-house team. </p> <p>The timetable now points to a vote on demutualisation early next year - probably at the end of January. Barring cataclysms, the result is a foregone conclusion. This will be followed by a virtual rubber stamping at the Court of Sessions in the summer. </p> <p>With-profits policyholders will then be told exactly how much they stand to make. And all windfalls will be paid out in autumn 2001.</p>",
  "<p>Banks and building societies have taken the hint from yet another announcement of unchanged Bank of England interest rates - they are using the standstill stance to edge the rates they pay to savers on to a downward slope. </p> <p>This leaves an offer of \"up to 10% tax-efficient income from a top performing trust\" as both a magnetic attraction for income seekers but also one which investors will treat with caution - headline promises of high income tend to come with small print traps. </p> <p>Problems can include excessive charges or one-way bets, where any growth above the promised level belongs to the fund management company, whereas shortfalls are down to the investor who can see their capital eroded by up to half. Over and above all that, investors are locked in for typically five to six year periods with substantial penalties for those looking for an early exit. </p> <p>But a new offer from Edinburgh-based investment trust group Ivory &amp; Sime - now part of the Friends Provident group - tries to square the circle by offering up to 10% income to investors in its relaunched ISIS investment trust without hidden traps and the chance of capital growth. And for all but the richest investors, the income will effectively be tax free. </p> <p>Ivory &amp; Sime first launched an ISIS trust in 1993 with a seven-year life. That is now reaching its end - it will expire in October - but the existing holders voted to continue the trust and enlarge it. It is currently worth around \u00a350m. After the new deal offer, it could grow to \u00a390m but no further. </p> <p>The fund invests in a portfolio of UK blue chip and smaller growth companies - with some success over five years where it emerged as the top trust in its class turning \u00a31,000 into \u00a32, 389 - although recently it has slipped with growth of 25.8% over the past year, just below the sector average. </p> <p>But the main interest lies in its structure which manages to avoid normal investment trust rules which demand that 85% of the income from shares is distributed to shareholders who are then taxed. </p> <p>Ivory &amp; Sime has created a trust where the public buys \"ordinary\" shares which have no income. The yield from the shares goes to the holders of \"fixed-rate annuity shares\". They are a fiendishly complicated piece of financial engineering, but as they are all held by parent company Friends Provident and not traded, investors do not need to understand them. These shares are used to boost the capital to make up for the lack of income. The end result is that by encashing ordinary shares on a regular basis, investors can have an income stream which the Inland Revenue will count as a capital gain. </p> <p>Provided the annual gain is below the capital gains tax exemption level - currently \u00a37,200 per person - the income is effectively tax free. </p> <p>Investors can select how much they want encashed between 0% and 10% a year - paid annually, quarterly or monthly - so the trust can generate long term growth. </p> <p>\"This decision can be changed at any time without charge or penalty,\" says Ivory &amp; Sime's Fiona Mackenzie. \"So you can decide to keep your capital intact if share prices fall or your need for income drops. Alternatively, you can sell in the market.\" </p> <p>Charges are a very low 0.55% a year with no entry or exit costs. Launch investors do not pay stamp duty. </p> <p>The one thing that can go wrong is that the underlying investments fail to grow. Those who continue to take their full income will find their investment shrinks. </p> <p>It will face competition from the new LeggMason Investors American Assets fund which promises \"outstanding growth potential and 8.25% income\" although neither is guaranteed. </p> <p>This investment trust will concentrate on US stocks with around half in blue chips listed in New York, around 15% in a portfolio of dollar denominated bonds with the balance in a portfolio of UK split level investment trusts. If the decline of the pound against the US currency continues, investors will make extra gains. </p> <p> On top of all this, the fund will be almost doubled through a bank loan deal. For each \u00a31 invested - the minimum is \u00a31,000 - the fund will invest a further 94p through this borrowing. </p> <p>There are a number of risks besides a reversal of the pound's current fortunes. A big interest rate increase could hit the bank loan; investing in split level investment trusts where many funds already invest in each other can be dangerous as a fall in one or two could have a house of cards effect; and the US stock market could go into reverse. </p> <p>Investors with no interest in income but who fear stock market volatility might take advice on the Manor Park UK Accelerated Growth Fund. </p> <p>This is a five year lockaway with a minimum \u00a35,000 investment which guarantees it will repay the original capital at the end of the period no matter what happens to share prices. In addition, it will pay out 120% of any gain in the FTSE 100 index of top UK companies. There is no limit on the growth - guaranteed by top rated financial institutions. </p> <p>Besides having to sign up for five years, the downside is that the fund ignores dividends which makes up a substantial part of long term growth. </p> <p>Investors going all out for growth with some risk could check out the new Aberdeen Global Champions unit trust, the latest entrant in a fast growing area where fund managers ignore geography or business sector to concentrate on \"big ideas\". </p> <p>Here the key themes are \"globalisation, innovation and communication.\" Aberdeen foresees a world where \"champions\" will \"not be constrained by geography, size, current business models, or traditional practices. They will excel on a world stage. They all benefit from new technology.\" </p> <p>But whether that remit is so wide as to include almost any growth stock in any market is open to debate. Aberdeen admits that too focused an investment theme would be shunned by unit buyers as too volatile. </p> <p>What is left will be a largely US oriented growth fund - whether it does any better than other American trusts remains to be seen. It charges a typical 1.5% annually but with a slightly lower than normal 4.25% upfront fee. The minimum investment is \u00a3500.</p>",
  "<p>Men are rarely viewed as the victims of sex discrimination, but in the past six years almost 200,000 widowed men have been denied a tax relief - typically worth around \u00a3500 - which has been available to widows. </p> <p>The government's position is so weak that it has settled one claim by a widower in order to avoid a hearing before the European Court of Human Rights, but the Revenue still flatly refuses to make payments to other men. This week the charity TaxAid launched a campaign for justice for all widowers. </p> <p>The Widow's Bereavement Allowance (WBA) was introduced in 1980 to ease financial burdens facing women who lost their husbands, giving them a special tax relief in the year of widowhood and the following tax year. </p> <p>While this was fair at a time when the tax system discriminated against wives, a relief given solely to women became indefensible following the introduction of independent taxation of married couples in 1990, and the rising importance of the European Convention on Human Rights, which outlaws sex discrimination. </p> <p>In 1995 Christopher Crossland's wife died and he gave up his \u00a350,000 a year job to care for his children. He claimed the WBA, but the taxman said it was not available to men. While many would have given up, Mr Crossland decided to fight his case right up to the European Court of Human Rights. </p> <p>At that point, fearing another embarrassing defeat before the European Court, the government backed down and settled the case by paying him the \u00a3575 claimed plus his legal costs. It also abolished the WBA for women widowed after April 5 2000. </p> <p>That Crossland settlement was reached in November 1999 and since then hundreds of claims have been made by men widowed in recent years seeking similar treatment. But every time the Revenue has refused to make any payment. </p> <p>The Revenue says it has no legal authority to grant relief to men, as the law refers only to widows. When we suggested that, having settled with Mr Crossland, it was unfair to deny a payment to other widowers in the identical position, a spokesman claimed he was prohibited by the rules of confidentiality from discussing Mr Crossland's affairs. </p> <p>Whatever the precise legal position, it is grossly unfair to settle with one person, just because he has the tenacity to fight his case, but then deny payment to others in an identical position. This is a clear breach of the promise, in the Revenue's Service Commitment, to treat all taxpayers fairly. </p> <p>TaxAid believes the Revenue's case is weak and is encouraging all men widowed between April 6 1994 and April 5 2000 to write a short letter (see end) to their tax office to claim a payment. </p> <p>TaxAid is also asking all accountants and tax advisers to claim on behalf of male clients who were widowed in that period. </p> <p>The campaign is being supported by barrister Philip Baker of Gray's Inn Tax Chambers, who is taking a pro bono case to the European Court on behalf of another widower.

  "<p>I think I'm addicted to reading. On a long flight I'm such a word junkie that I end up reading all that small print on the back of the ticket about not carrying bombs on planes if you can avoid it (it's the Warsaw Convention, check it out next time.) </p> <p>And if I'm in the bath too long, it's only a matter of time before I start reading the labels on the back of the shampoo and bubble bath. And apart from learning the Finnish for \"hair care\" (it seems to be a country where they've mistaken a stutter for a language), you'll soon discover that almost everything that's in a plastic container in a bathroom is made of the same ingredients.</p> <p>They might claim to be unique, they might be revolutionary, they might be for entirely different markets and purposes, but you can bet your backside that, apart from the packaging, they're all more or less the same stuff. Take a look at your shampoo, shaving foam, bath lotion, bubble bath, even your minty-blue cool-gel toothpaste and among the main ingredients will be aqua (water), laureth sodium sulfate (stuff that foams up) and a whole list of other near-identical contents.</p> <p>This same sense of more or less the same products dressed up in different boxes may have occurred to the hundreds of thousands of students who, in the next couple of weeks, will be choosing their first bank account and might be struggling to find the differences.</p> <p>For the banks, this is a once-a-year chance to recruit customers who could stay with them for life. And by promising a few introductory offers now, the banks hope to acquire account holders who, in a few years, will be high-earning graduates.</p> <p>This is big business, as the current total for students in higher education has reached more than 1.75 million. So what are students being offered to lure them into a lifetime relationship?</p> <p>If you cut away the slightly embarrassing attempts to be hip in the packaging, the high street banks are almost all promising the same three things: a basic current account, an interest-free overdraft and a freebie (along the lines of a CD voucher). And considering the long-term benefit to the banks, I'm always surprised how modest these efforts are. Given that it's difficult to get young people excited about a bank account, you'd think that the free gifts could have been slightly more adventurous.</p> <p>For instance, Barclays offers \u00a340 worth of vouchers, NatWest promises a CD player or \u00a335 cash and HSBC will slip you \u00a350 or a young person's railcard, the level of birthday present teenagers might expect from a generous granny rather than a global financial organisation.</p> <p>It might not be particularly ethical, but if the banks got serious about bribing and offered free tickets to New York they could sign up a whole generation of students for the price of a few charter flights. So if the freebies aren't going to turn many heads, the interest-free overdraft limits could be the biggest attraction.</p> <p>These range between \u00a3500 and \u00a32,000, often with the higher limits only available to students after a couple of years. For first-years, Abbey National is offering \u00a31,000 in interest-free overdrafts, Bank of Scotland \u00a31,200, Barclays \u00a31,250, Lloyds TSB, \u00a31,500 and NatWest will negotiate individually. And in terms of what students need most - money - there are not going to be many better ways of borrowing.</p> <p>Using an interest-free overdraft is certainly preferable to another product on offer, the student credit card. In my own time at university, the campus bank manager handed me a \u00a350 cheque guarantee card as gingerly as if it were a loaded revolver with the safety catch off, so the idea of giving me a credit card would have killed him on the spot.</p> <p>But there are now customised cards, such as the Student Barclaycard, which takes no prisoners with interest at 19.4 APR. By the time students graduate it's estimated that almost a third will have credit card debts.</p> <p>There are other benefits on offer to students. Discounted insurance is available from banks including HSBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland, covering contents and travel - and since students often end up in the type of insecure accommodation favoured by burglars, it's well worth considering.</p> <p>And the advice available from banks shouldn't be overlooked. Student life is now synonymous with debt, and debt can be a very stressful and isolating experience, so specialist advice from a bank with a branch in or near university could be a very valuable service. And remember, as you're heading towards thousands of pounds of debt, don't spend those \u00a340 CD vouchers all at once.</p> <p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:coughlan_sean@hotmail.com\">coughlan_sean@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>An increasing number of websites are being aimed at \"silver surfers\", the fast-growing band of older people who are discovering the power of the internet. </p> <p>\"It's very easy to write older people off when it comes to new technology,\" says a spokesperson for <a href=\"http://www.ace.org.uk/\">Age Concern</a>, the UK's largest charitable operation, which celebrates its 60th birthday this week. \"But the reality is that one in four people aged 50 plus uses a computer in their spare time, some 2.2m older people already use the internet and even more email their friends and family.\" </p> <p>Recognising the internet as a valuable information and communication tool for older people, particularly the isolated, Age Concern, in partnership with Microsoft, is piloting Mobile IT Training Sessions (MITS) around the UK to introduce the new technology to older people. </p> <p>This week has also seen the launch <a href=\"http://www.helptheaged.org.uk/\">Help the aged</a>'s website, which aims to provide 10.8m older people, their relatives and carers with information on all aspects relating to the older population. It allows visitors with poor vision to enlarge text on screen or change colours. </p> <p>Help the Aged director general Michael Lake says: \"The sheer power of the internet to inform and empower older people has the potential to change the way everyone lives their lives. For too long retired people have been excluded from the routes to political and social influence. This will now change as the silver surfers access services, consumer goods and government from the comfort of their own homes.\" </p> <p>So where do novice silver surfers start? If you can't afford your own computer, many public libraries and local colleges offer cheap access to PCs and hundreds of day centres are also connecting up to give thousands of low-income pensioners ready access to internet sites. </p> <p>There is a growing wealth of websites aimed at those in their middle to older years. Here is a taster of some worth visiting. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.helptheaged.org.uk\">http://www.helptheaged.org.uk</a></strong></p> <p> This user-friendly site lets you access the charity's range of advice leaflets on subjects including pensions, residential care and welfare support as well as background briefings on the older population and government policy. You can also get information on events and campaigns, make donations online and register to receive emailed monthly policy update bulletins. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.ageconcern.org.uk\">http://www.ageconcern.org.uk</a></strong></p> <p> This site comes with a useful guided tour with short cuts to its main sections including news, Age Concern publications, links to other useful websites and a huge range of factsheets on a range of topics for older people which you can read on screen or print. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbb.org.uk\">http://www.bbb.org.uk</a></strong></p> <p> Baby Boomer Bistro is \"an internet chat cafe designed for the over-50s\" set up by Age Concern's sister organisation Age Resource. After registering by choosing a chat name and a password, you to join in online discussions about day-to-day events and topics by visiting different \"rooms\", some with specific themes and some designed for private chats. The rooms are regularly monitored to ensure they are not being abused. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.arp.org.uk\">http://www.arp.org.uk</a> </strong></p> <p> The website for the Association of Retired and Persons over 50, Britain's largest campaigning organisation for people over 50 with 100,000-plus members. Lots of interesting and useful information on a wide range of topics including health, study, retirement, employment, property, caring, travel and finance, though the association is an introducer for financial products only from CGU Financial Services. Allows you to email your views on various topics. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.vavo.com\">http://www.vavo.com</a></strong></p> <p> Launched a year ago and now with over 40,000 registered members, this is described as the market leading \"portal\" or \"online community\" for people aged 45 and over where the site contents are largely dictated by what members want. </p> <p>It offers access to a several channels including news, on-line shopping, health, travel, finance and dating, where you can read features and ask questions of experts. </p> <p>You can also access more than 100 topic areas set up and run by members, complete with chat rooms, on anything from hobbies and leisure pursuits to campaigning issues such as lobbying for better pensions and getting older people back to work. </p> <p>So popular is the site that more than 200 members are meeting face-to-face for a weekend in a hotel later this month to celebrate vavo.com's first birthday. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.seniority.co.uk\">http://www.seniority.co.uk</a></strong></p> <p> Described as an, \"informative, fun and interactive online community created by and for people aged 50(ish!)\", this is a similar, but smaller, idea to vavo.com, though perhaps a bit more tricky to use. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.idf50.co.uk\">http://www.idf50.co.uk</a></strong></p> <p> \"I don't feel 50\" is a lively site set up in 1998 as \"the first UK site for over 50s\" by Graham Andrews, who felt that existing over-50s organisations tended to be a bit, \"po-faced and institutional\". The aim of the site is to give' \"practical, unbiased help to people aged 50-plus\" and it gives lots of information on a range of serious subjects from financing your retirement to prostate cancer as well as lighter topics such as all-time favourite music albums. Also allows exchange of views via email. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.hellsgeriatrics.com\">http://www.hellsgeriatrics.com</a></strong></p> <p> An intriguing site which introduces itself by saying: \"For too long the world wide web has been the domain of callow youth. Now it is time for the over-50s to fight back and claim their rightful status in cyberspace.\" It offers chat rooms and a small mix of both serious and fun topics including a section on alien life and a good humour section. Its irreverent tone is set by the caveat: \"HG is a non-profit making organisation but not intentionally so!\" </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.saga.co.uk\">http://www.saga.co.uk</a></strong></p> <p> As the website for Saga magazine, the UK's largest monthly magazine for people aged 50 and over, this has the current issue online plus a large amount of archived material from past issues. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.lifebegins.net\">http://www.lifebegins.net</a></strong></p> <p> This is an online magazine for, \"discerning 50-somethings\" which offers great service for novice silver surfers because it explains the basics of website mechanics so clearly. </p> <p>Its forum section, for example, is,\"an electronic bulletin board on which you can submit your comments and views which stay on the board for three months and to which any number of people can respond\" while its chat section offers, \"instantaneous, simultaneous discussions without a written record of what has been said\".</p>",

  "<p>When L'Humanit\u00e9 was shown in Cannes last year, it was jeered to the echo. Many critics mocked the movie, denouncing it for its glacial, pseudo-Bressonian slowness and failure to function plausibly either as a policier or a psychological study. Most damningly of all, it was held to have been a disastrous follow-up to Dumont's much-admired first film, La Vie de J\u00e9sus. </p> <p>But I can't agree. Far from being a disappointment or an artistic wrong turning, Dumont's film is a cogent development from La Vie de J\u00e9sus and nothing less than a masterpiece: haunting, disturbing and daring. It resists the generic boundaries of thriller, or police drama, or realist conventions of any sort, seeming instead to attain the status of some horrifying, extended bad dream which has somehow been tricked out with the superficial appurtenances of real life. Only its inconsistencies and unrealities hint at the fact that the viewer has actually been immersed in a strange nightmare universe: a hyper-real poem of darkness. </p> <p>Just as in La Vie de J\u00e9sus, the action takes place in the grim, undistinguished countryside of northern France. Admirers of that film will remember that its hero Freddy, having been taken into police custody on a serious criminal charge, is for some reason allowed to wander out and lie down in a cornfield for the final shot. Then, Dumont hinted at the discovery of a subversive, even a darkly playful way of subtly modifying the realities of day-to-day life, these realities being the more coercive, and their contravention the more disquieting, for being police realities. </p> <p>In this film, an 11-year-old girl has been brutally raped and murdered. Dumont does not scruple to show the naked corpse, left on the edge of a ploughed field. The camera, in one of its many slow, silent takes, shows tiny ants scurrying over the pitifully pale, bruised skin. But just before this, we have seen Pharaon (Emmanuel Schott\u00e9) running over this field, and collapsing in the mud, his bulging eyes staring straight ahead. Pharaon turns out to be a police superintendent investigating the case and, moreover, a painfully inadequate individual whose strange, torpid manner is due to his girlfriend and baby having recently died. So we are invited to assume that Pharaon is in fact the murderer. </p> <p>Or are we? As the film continues, nothing in Pharaon's behaviour is obviously consistent with the classic template of a deranged murderer gradually disclosing his true self to the camera; in fact his weird running across the field might be some sort of intuitive, premonitory empathy with the victim. </p> <p>Pharaon is to all intents and purposes a simpleton, a virtual village idiot. And yet he is also a police officer, despite the fact that, as one of the locals snarls at him: \"You're too stupid to be a cop!\" Indeed, the entire police department conduct their investigations in what looks like a very lugubrious and casual manner; there seems no systematic interrogation of witnesses, no DNA analysis, and an approach to a local psychiatric hospital is casually suggested by one of the sergeants on the basis that his brother-in-law works there. The top brass from \"Paris and Lille\" are supposed to be helping but nowhere is their big-city sophistication to be seen in the film. </p> <p>But this does not diminish its haunting power, because the police-procedural qualities carry a subtly parodic air; they are a puzzle; they are defiantly at odds with a rational existence. And in any case, they are subservient to the scalp-prickling anxiety and creeping sense of horror that Dumont slowly but surely accumulates, largely through Pharaon's fascination with unpleasant phenomena, such as the beefy sweatiness of his inspector's neck, similar to the revolting pink flesh of a sow and her litter in the farmyard of the victim's family, the queasy panoply of \"humanity\". </p> <p>It is one of the most bizarre, yet somehow inspired touches of this film that Pharaon turns out to be the grandson of a distinguished artist, also called Pharaon De Winter, whose brooding self-portrait Pharaon loans to a local gallery. Is his obsessiveness, his stupefied, faintly malign obsession with pain the remnant of an artistic nature? Like so much else in this captivating film, it is a mystery. </p> <p>L'Humanit\u00e9 demands a considerable investment of attention, and a willingness to enter Dumont's islanded world of violence and dysfunction and accept it partly as an elaborate, visionary metaphor. Once that investment is made, the rewards are very great. Every time I watch it, I am possessed with an Ancient Mariner-like desire to grab the sleeves of passers-by and tell them to see it. Its scenes, its images, its strange atmospherics reverberate ineradicably in the mind.</p>",
  "<p>Pisceans often get a good press for being dreamy, artistic and compassionate. You can be forgiven then for failing to recognise media mogul Rupert Murdoch as a paid-up Piscean (11.59pm GST, March 11 1931, Melbourne). </p> <p>What the books often forget is the inner contradiction in Pisces. The symbol is two fish swimming in opposite directions. One is a helpful dolphin, the other an all-devouring shark.</p> <p>Murdoch's watery nature is compounded by three planets in Cancer the crab. Water signs run deep and shy away from the sunlight, like fish beneath the surface or crabs scuttling under rocks.</p> <p>This can be an asset in a business context because water knows which way the tides are turning. Murdoch couples this with a libertarian, entrepreneurial moon in horsy Sagittarius, which loves the thrill of the chase. Only now - in the dot.com era - is his confidence beginning to wane with projects like FiredUp.</p> <p>Murdoch's silver-spoon background and good fortune come from Jupiter in Cancer - the family sign - and its connections with the moon. But what really drives him on? </p> <p>His daughter Elisabeth seems to speak truthfully when she says her father is not driven by greed. Murdoch's published time of birth gives us a fuller psychological profile than one based only on his day of birth. His ambitious Capricorn Ascendant is tied in with an opposition of controlling Saturn and autocratic Pluto, right across his money and death zones.</p> <p>Murdoch's media career began in 1952 when his father died suddenly and he returned to Australia to take over the family publishing business.</p> <p>Saturn-Pluto transmutes mortality into cash - a burden of responsibility which forever pursues him like the ghost of the father. The question of legacy for him now is the same question that has always been there, binding his offspring through a business empire.</p> <p>The current focus in his horoscope is on Neptune crossing Venus until the end of November 2001. This god of the sea has been his empire builder, but now it suggests sacrifice and dissolution.</p> <p>Neptune's same influence triggers News International's UK horoscope (July 28 1904), perhaps putting it at sea in the coming months. Murdoch is slipping towards a dissolving agenda, rather than a definitive stand-down. </p> <p>He may take a major step along these lines in February, but how will the family shape up?

  "<p>Bill Clinton last night won a pledge from the world's biggest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, to halt the relentless rise in the price of crude which yesterday brought France to a halt and prompted fears of a global recession. </p> <p>As UK petrol firms responded to the 10-year-high in oil prices by putting up fuel prices by 2p a litre, crown prince Abdullah said Saudi Arabia would raise production by 700,000 barrels a day in an effort to ease pressure on the west. </p> <p>However, oil experts said the 3% increase in output would not be enough to bring crude oil prices to below $30 a barrel and motoring organisations warned that British drivers could soon expect to pay \u00a34 for a gallon of petrol. </p> <p>Speaking at the UN millennium summit in New York, President Clinton said he had put pressure on Saudi Arabia to take action ahead of Sunday's meeting of Opec - the 11-member oil producers' cartel. </p> <p>\"I told him I was very concerned that the price of oil is too high, not just for America but for the world,\" said Mr Clinton after his meeting with the crown prince. \"If it was to cause a recession in any part of the world that would hurt the oil producing countries.\" </p> <p>Large parts of France ran out of fuel yesterday as hauliers and farmers, more determined than ever to win big fuel tax cuts from the government, continued their four-day blockade of oil refineries and depots. </p> <p>Angry farmers, already active on most of the 120 blockades up and down the country, successfully blocked the entrance to the Channel tunnel with their tractors, triggering scuffles with British tourists. </p> <p>Around 50 British holidaymakers mounted a counter-blockade by blocking a lane being used by the authorities to allow French cars to trickle past the barricades, and threatened to cut off the main A16 motorway if they were not allowed to get through the blockade and go home. Under police escort, a convoy of British cars and coaches was eventually allowed through in the late afternoon. </p> <p>A British police sergeant, who was part of the convoy but asked not to be named, said: \"It seems we managed to outmanoeuvre them with a bit of British courage and some cunning. We played them at their own game and it worked. In the end it was quite a fun victory for all.\" </p> <p>Another convoy member, Frank Davidson, 49, said: \"This was as sweet a victory as Wellington over Napoleon at Waterloo. They didn't like it when we put up a fight.\" </p> <p>While talks resumed late in the afternoon between the French transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, and the two main hauliers' federations, the government reiterated that it would go no further than the 15% tax cut, worth \u00a3100m, it offered on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the European commission threatened legal action if the free movement of goods within the EU was disrupted. </p> <p>As the protest spread, the hauliers, farmers, ambulance drivers and coach firms were joined by thousands of taxi drivers in massed \"go-slow\" processions that brought traffic to a halt in a dozen cities and caused motorway tailbacks. </p> <p>At least three regional airports reported they would be out of aviation fuel by this morning. Wholesalers at the main Rungis market outside Paris said supplies of fresh fruit and vegetable were beginning to be affected and 80% of the country's petrol stations were either dry, subject to rationing of \u00a315 per vehicle, or had been requisitioned for emergency service use only. </p> <p>In the financial markets yesterday, the price of a barrel of crude oil eased back from a peak of $34.50 to $33.91. However, dealers said that most of the Saudi production increase had been anticipated by the markets and that prices were not likely to fall markedly. </p> <p>They said Saudi Arabia was the key player in the crisis because it was the only Opec nation with the spare capacity to pump the extra oil needed to bring prices under control. But it can expect opposition from other Opec members who are enjoying extra revenues from the price surge from under $10 a barrel at the start of last year. </p> <p>Lawrence Eagles, oil analyst at the City firm GNI Securities, said a harsh winter could boost demand by an extra 500,000 barrels a day, pushing prices still higher.\"You can't rule out $40 a barrel if Opec aren't prepared to act,\" he said.</p>",
  "Past the narrow, dirty bazaar, barely wide enough for farmers leading their oxen, and down a maze of shaded streets the lives of the women of Ghaziabad are quietly changing. <p>Three years ago Moafia Nazir's parents would not let her walk alone through the market in this poor, conservative corner of Pakistan. The neighbours' gossip would have shamed the family. </p> <p>Moafia, who was 17 at the time, could not read or write. She dropped out of school as a young child and never went back. Eventually she convinced her parents to let her cross the bazaar in this village on the outskirts of Lahore because on the other side was the Khoj school. This was a chance to try again. </p> <p>Three years on she has just passed the first of her matriculation exams, equivalent to GCSE, and is teaching at the school herself. </p> <p>\"I always wonder why it is in Pakistan that girls should not get an education and why they should not be allowed out of their houses,\" Moafia said. \"Why do the men think there is a problem?\" </p> <p>Education is failing Pakistanis. Just 45% of the adult population are literate, while for women in backward, rural Baluchistan that figure slumps to just 8.8%. </p> <p>Khoj, which translates as \"quest\", has taken a radically different approach to tackling the problem. </p> <p>Urdu is taught phonetically to adult women and literacy classes are entwined with discussions about community development and the rights of women in an often unforgiving and deeply conservative Islamic society. </p> <p>\"If you teach only literacy it will flop,\" said Nasira Habib, a philosophy graduate who developed the unconventional phonetic teaching system and started Khoj in 1994. </p> <p>\"Literacy is just a tool. If there is no training of the mind, then literacy only creates dumb people who don't ask questions and become complacent.\" </p> <p>Most women at the school learn to read and write within three months, although the basic course lasts a year. Lessons are based on a list of key words, used to provoke discussions. The first word the adults learn is aurat or \"woman\". </p> <p>Still studying for her next matriculation exam Moafia, dressed in a polka dot shalwar kameez trouser suit, crouches on a classroom floor teaching what she has learned to a crowd of children and earning her economic independence. </p> <p>\"Learning about the word \"aurat\" taught me I could do something and that I should not think I am a woman and I cannot do anything,\" she said. \"It has made me think: 'I am a woman. I have rights. How can I get my rights?'\" </p> <p>As the muezzin in the mosque next door calls for lunchtime prayers Moafia joins the adult classes for their daily two-hour lesson on the rooftop of a nearby building, another of the 10 Khoj centres in Ghaziabad. </p> <p>On the wall is a poster of a pen, held up like a sword in a shaft of light. \"Education is a strength,\" it reads. Another poster shows a woman in an academic gown holding a scroll: \"Better education will provide better employment.\" </p> <p>The women all have stories of how their literacy has helped them check the expiry date on packets of medicine, understand medical reports or simply read bus numbers and escape the ridicule of their male neighbours. </p> <p>But for most the biggest lesson has been dealing with the opposition from their families and centuries of conservative tradition. </p> <p>Razia comes from a Sindi family of four sons and four daughters. Only the boys were allowed to go to school. </p> <p>\"I used to wear a burqa and never went to the bazaar,\" she said, describing the all-enveloping cloak women in only the most traditional Pakistani communities are still forced to wear. \"Now I come here and I am not afraid of men as I was before. Men are no longer a threat to us.\" </p> <p>One of the first questions the women ask is whether arranged marriages, which are the norm in the narrow streets of Ghaziabad, are justified. </p> <p>\"We ask people to respect traditions but rights are rights, there is no compromise on that,\" said Sumera Jabeen, one of the senior teachers at Khoj. </p> <p>\"We told them it is their right to choose their life partner for themselves. It is a revolution but we think that bad customs should be broken.\" </p> <p><b> Pakistan</b><br> </p> <p><b>Male</b> </p> <p>Adult literacy rate 52% </p> <p>Number of illiterates (millions) 20 </p> <p>Net primary school enrolment rate 49% </p> <p><b>Female</b></p> <p>Adult literacy rate 26% </p> <p>Number of illiterates (millions) 28 </p> <p>Net primary school enrolment rate 38% </p> <p>\u0095<b> Education spending as % of GNP</b> Pakistan 2.7% Nigeria 0.7% </p> <p>\u0095<b> Military spending as % of GNP</b> Pakistan 5.7% Nigeria 1.4% </p> <p>Source: World Bank</p>",
  "<p>Pantaloons, knickerbockers, cigarette pants, drainpipes and combat kecks: there are numerous ways to construct four pieces of rectangular material into a pair of trousers, but am I the only woman in Britain who has difficulty finding a pair of strides to suit her? Didn't think so. I doubt my heart will be the only one to beat a little faster at the news that high-street favourite, Warehouse, has come up with a solution that promises to banish British women's trouser woes: The Collection, launched this month, comprises eight key trouser shapes from tailored lurex to sleek black, with a choice of details including kick flares and back zips, with prices ranging from \u00a330 to \u00a350. This is the first stand-alone trouser collection from a high-street store and is a shrewd homage to the success of the slightly pricier Joseph's Essentials range of trousers, which many lean-limbed shoppers already rely on. So has Warehouse come up trumps? </p> <p>Women have been wearing trousers since the beginning of the last century. Coco Chanel boosted their appeal in the 20s when she introduced \"yachting pants\" to be worn for leisurely pursuits. From working in regulation trousers in factories during the second world war to donning unisex bell bottoms in the 60s, women in trousers became acceptable. Yet it remains difficult to find a pair that flatters, with too few manufacturers understanding the trouser secret: that the length/ waist/bottom ratio has to be right. Trousers don't necessarily have to make you look \"slim\", rather, women are more concerned with making their bottom look \"fit\", that is rounded, pert and not too big. </p> <p>A quick poll among my female friends revealed that each had precise criteria when selecting trousers. For Jane, who is 5ft 3in, the perfect trousers would be \"flattering on my bum, a good length: not too loose or tight, plain not patterned, in a dark colour and with side pockets and front zip\". The ideal pair for Lucy, 5ft 11in, would need to have \"a good butt with the waist fitting perfectly and not gapey. They must not bag at knee and should be sharp and snappy.\" Louise, 5ft 2in, summed up her requirements with, \"my perfect pair of trousers manages to make my legs look longer and my bum smaller\". </p> <p>The majority of women shoppers have a fair idea of what suits them, but there are ways to cheat. The following styles seem to be universally flattering: wide leg, boot leg, flat-fronted, or slightly flared. There are also styles which look universally bad - elasticated waists, for example. Much better to have the waist of your trousers shaped with darts and seams than clenched around your middle with unforgiving elastic. Equally, tapered legs give a larger woman's figure a frog-like look so better to stick to the straight leg, or slightly flared. Trousers cut for a more mature figure, particularly those sold in stores such as M&amp;S, allow extra fabric on the hips, which is forgiving to a pear- shape, although it can lend a \"saddle-bag\" effect to women with narrower hips. </p> <p>If you are short waisted, one word: hipsters. These will create the illusion of a longer upper body - wear a snakey belt on your hips, and suddenly your waist has dropped two inches. Trouser legs should err on the long side - why make your legs look shorter, after all? - with the hem sitting on your shoe. However, a hem that brushes against the floor is best left to the young and trendy in Hoxton. </p> <p>Then there's the underwear issue. Do you want the world to see what sort of knickers you are wearing? Trousers and VPL (visible panty line) have an irritating tendency to go hand in hand and a fleshy rear cut in half by knicker elastic is plain unsexy. The solution is to get friendly with a full-length mirror and a G-string, as trousers that look fabulous from the front could be disastrous from behind. A G-string can be comfortable if you choose cotton versions that are less a \"string\" and more a \"strip\" of fabric. Tight shorts-style briefs also work - hipster versions avoid showing your pants everytime you sit down - and M&amp;S does a range of trouser knickers that lend elasticated support and uplift to your derri\u00e8re. </p> <p>We gathered four women - two over 5ft 10in, the other two only a whisper over 5ft - and shut them in a studio with a rack of trousers from Warehouse, and a few competitors. The problems started when two women, with a height difference of nearly 8in between them, tested the same pair of size 12 trousers. Inevitably, neither found a perfect fit. They were either too long or too short and while trews can be taken up, they can not be taken down. More time was spent trying on than shooting the photographs, with much sticking up of hems and yanking down waist bands in an effort to make hems reach ankles. Warehouse fared well, with thumbs up for the Prince of Wales check (\u00a345) and chalk stripe (\u00a345), but as they don't come in different lengths the taller testers were left disappointed. </p> <p>The designer versus high-street debate is a decision for your pocket rather than your figure. Predictably, the cheaper the trouser, the weaker the cut, as our testers confirmed, but that doesn't mean Miss Selfridge or Oasis won't be trouser heaven for you. Petite ranges are also a good bet for trousers with smaller proportions - try Marks &amp; Spencer, Next and Dorothy Perkins. </p> <p>The rule is, if you find a pair that flatters, buy them in every colour - better still, get them made for you. Then you will know that someone somewhere has the template for your perfect trousers ready to be run off in whichever fabric takes your fancy. Trouser nirvana indeed.</p>",
  "<p>Bruce Gyngell, the Australian inventor of British breakfast television, who has died aged 71, was one of the most colourful, idiosyncratic and domineering of media pioneers. He was far removed from the grey-haired executives who have tended to control ITV television behind the scenes. Gyngell stood out even in an industry where media tycoons from Lord (Lew) Grade to Rupert Murdoch called the shots. His staff nicknamed him the \"Pink Panther\" because of his love for the colour he saw as life enhancing (he wore pastel pink shirts, and had his office painted pink, with yellow sofas).</p> <p> His 50-year career was packed with dramatic twists, spanning the start of TV in Australia - his was the first face to appear on screens - and the introduction of sofa-style TV to Britain. Gyngell is best known here for his high profile completion of the rescue of TV-am in 1983, after a disastrous launch.</p> <p> The first commercial breakfast franchise had teetered on the verge of collapse, losing \u00a3500,000 a month, when he was persuaded by Australian colleague and businessman Kerry Packer (who had taken a rescue stake) to sort it out. By 1986 it was ready for flotation on the stock exchange, and briefly flowered into the most profitable of TV networks. This was achieved by ruthlessly targeting programme costs - and dumping the 1984 Olympics coverage. He made the station a place \"of eternal summer so that the lost, lonely people could turn on and feel warm and bright\" - naff, but effective. </p> <p> He single-handedly invented friendly, sofa-style TV and chatty presentation, although in fact it was far from easy. The TV-am sofas were actually benches, to encourage guests to sit up, but were upholstered to disguise this. Viewers felt they had joined a surrogate family, with Anne Diamond playing the fresh-faced but smart girl from next door. The company, run from its Camden, North London, headquarters (with distinctive egg cups on the roof) by staff working unsociable hours, was moulded around him and his often faddish likes and dislikes. </p> <p> Some thought him barmy, predatory, or worse. You had to fit in. But he encouraged newcomers into TV. His former secretary, Ulrika Jonsson, was made the weather girl, to inject some cheer into forecasts. Gyngell broke the rules and liked to pose as being outside of the wasteful British TV establishment, while always remembering to court the powerful. One of his early fallings out was with a youngish, talented executive on the rise, Greg Dyke, who had already set TV-am on the road to recovery before Gyngell arrived with Roland Rat.</p> <p> Gyngell, an outspoken believer in market forces, but with charm bordering on charisma, became prime minister Margaret Thatcher's favourite broadcasting executive. When she complained about ITV being the \"last bastion of restrictive practices\", he endured a bruising technicians strike between 1987 and 1988 - more than 200 people were sacked - but suffered a heart attack due to stress.</p> <p> He wanted ITV to change, to cut out waste and to redraw the regional network, and a Channel 5 to provide more competition. But by 1988 he was speaking out against a blind auction of franchises, recognising the destruction it would wreak. By a cruel twist, the highest bidder auction Thatcher introduced in the flawed 1990 Broadcasting Act ensured TV-am's \u00a314.3m bid was completely overshadowed by a rival consortium offer of \u00a334.6m, when the awards were announced in October 1991. TV-am, the company he had shaped and nurtured, was effectively destroyed. But Gyngell had a final surprise up his sleeve. A day after the news broke, Gyngell was hosting the first (and last) TV-am journalism awards. He dramatically, almost as an afterthought, produced a handwritten letter from Thatcher and read it out to an astonished audience. </p> <p> \"When I see how some of the licences have been awarded, I am mystified that you did not receive yours and heartbroken. You of all people have done so much for the whole of television... I am only too painfully aware that I was responsible for the legislation,\" she wrote. It was a sensation. The audience gasped, then applauded. Thatcher was saying sorry. </p> <p>In true Gyngell style, he refused to be broken. He proceeded to hold the company together until December 31, 1992, through the sheer force of his personality. The final morning's broadcast ended, at 9.30am, with the station belting out \"You're Simply the Best\" as a photo of everyone who had ever worked for the station was flashed onto the screen - from Ulrika Jonsson (weather girl) to doorman and Mrs Thatcher's daughter, Carol. It was a moment of high emotion, and great sadness. Gyngell then hosted a champagne-fuelled farewell party with the sole founder-survivor, Sir David Frost, by his side. Yet, true to promise, the severance terms were very generous and many of his multi-skilled, hard working staff were snapped up by successor GMTV and the rest of ITV. Five years later, he had the bitter satisfaction of being proved right as the licence payments were slashed.</p> <p>Bruce Gyngell, broadcasting executive, born July 8 1929, died September 7 2000. <br> </p> <p>This is an extract from the full obituary, which appears in tomorrow's Guardian</p>",
  "British farmers and truckers have vowed to continue their French-style disruption over high fuel costs after hundreds turned out to blockade an oil refinery. <p>A continuing blockade by protesting farmers and hauliers prevented dozens of tankers from leaving Shell's Stanlow oil refinery near Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. </p> <p>Lorry drivers were planning a protest later today on the A1 near Gateshead, Tyne &amp; Wear. And farmers warned that demonstrations would continue over the weekend and spread across the country. </p> <p>On the continent, French attempts to blockade the Channel tunnel in a similar protest against fuel prices were thwarted by police. </p> <p>However, with petrol growing extremely scarce in France because of widespread blockades, the UK's Freight Transport Association reported that two British lorry drivers had their vehicles hijacked and diesel fuel syphoned off by protesters in the Cherbourg area. </p> <p>UK Transport Minister Lord Macdonald said British protesters did not have the right to interrupt vital supplies. </p> <p>But David Handley, chairman of Farmers for Action UK warned: \"This is going to be an ongoing situation. I would suggest to you this is going to be the winter of unrest.\" </p> <p>A Shell spokesman at Stanlow said the protest would begin to have an effect on petrol stations throughout the north of England later today. </p> <p>Last night, more than 250 farmers and lorry drivers used vehicles to block the Shell oil refinery. </p> <p>Farmers' spokesman Brynle Williams said demonstrators had travelled from North Wales, Cheshire, Lancashire, Staffordshire and Shropshire to protest at escalating pump prices. </p> <p>Seven fuel tankers were held up outside the plant during the six-hour protest, as police withheld from using their powers to break up the blockade. Organisers warned there will be more action at the weekend. </p> <p>\"The farmers and the road hauliers have now combined and have come to demonstrate their displeasure with the cost of fuel and with the possibility of a three or four pence increase,\" said Mr Williams. </p> <p>Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd, who has met some of the drivers - many of whom were from north Wales - said he could not condone their action, but he sympathised with their predicament. </p> <p>The member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said he feared someone could get hurt if the protests continued and he urged the demonstrators not to break the law. </p> <p>\"They have a case to put to government and I would hope very shortly that government will sit down and reconsider the matter because we are paying well over the odds for fuel in the UK,\" he said. \"One individual told me that his monthly fuel bill has gone up by \u00a31,000 in three months and he has virtually been broken completely now economically... I'm concerned that somebody may get injured.\" </p> <p>Mr Llwyd said Chancellor Gordon Brown had sufficient excesses in his coffers to alleviate the fuel costs. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that cars, vans or Land Rovers were not a luxury in rural areas, such as his constituency, but a necessity for people to get around because of a lack of reliable public transport. It was \"absolutely ridiculous\" that fuel cost almost \u00a34 a gallon. </p> <p>After the all-night blackade, protesters were given 10 minutes to clear the road and as the deadline passed up to 30 officers filed down the highway. </p> <p>There was uproar in Britain as oil companies announced another rise of 2p on the cost of a litre of fuel. It is now feared that fuel could rise to nearly 87p a litre within weeks, taking the cost of a gallon to \u00a34. </p> <p>The latest increase is due to a rise in the price of crude oil; oil producers' body Opec will meet in Vienna on Sunday to discuss the issue.</p>",
  "<p>The Press Complaints Commission is to publish new guidelines for the media to protect the privacy of the prime minister's son, Leo Blair.</p> <p>Chairman Lord Wakeham said it was in everyone's interest to set stronger guidelines on stories affecting the children of high-profile public figures. </p> <p>The advice follows a request by Tony Blair, who was upset when unofficial photographs of his son's Christening appeared in the press. </p> <p>Speaking this morning on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Lord Wakeham said: \"Unless the press go absolutely mad, we should be reasonably all right about free expression in the newspapers. We will watch it very carefully.\" </p> <p>Lord Wakeham said existing guidelines were temporary in nature because they worked for a while but then quickly became out of date whenever a new situation arose. </p> <p>He added that he expected that the PCC would need to address a few problems arising from human rights legislation.</p> <p>\"The prime minister has asked me to produce some guidelines as to how the code ought to apply to children, to Leo in particular. We are just trying to put that together and we should be hopefully able to publish it fairly soon. It is not a new problem, but it needs to be redefined every now and again. We are not looking for perfection,\" said Lord Wakeham.</p> <p>\"What we are looking for are practical, working ways forward, so that it is reasonable on both sides. The public gets to know what it should know, newspapers get their stories, but at the same time privacy is not intruded on.\" </p>",

  "<p>Space shuttle Atlantis, carrying five Americans and two Russians, is on its way to furnish the growing international space station. </p> <p>Nasa had worried for days that rain might delay the launch. But the approaching storm slowed down and stayed far enough offshore, allowing the shuttle to rise from its seaside pad into a cloudy sky at 12.45 GMT, right on time. </p> <p>Atlantis' 11-day voyage is the first shuttle flight in almost four months and the start of what Nasa hopes will be a rapid-fire series of missions to the space station.</p> <p>It was an auspicious start - this was the first punctual launch for the space shuttle program since John Glenn's return to orbit in October 1998. </p> <p>\"Have a nice trip. Make the station into a home,\" launch controller George Gross told the astronauts just before liftoff. </p> <p>\"We intend to do just that,\" replied shuttle commander Terrence Wilcutt. </p> <p>The space station was soaring over Hungary, 6,600 miles away, when Atlantis took off. The shuttle should catch up early Sunday. </p> <p>The five US astronauts and two Russian cosmonauts will be the first to float into the space station's new Russian-made control module, Zvezda, which means Star. Its arrival 1 1/2 months ago nearly doubled the size of the station to a crowded three rooms. </p> <p>Wilcutt and his crew will unload thousands of pounds of supplies from Atlantis and a Russian supply ship that already is docked to the space station. They also will install the toilet, set up the treadmill and lay cable. Until Zvezda's launch in July, more than two years late, space station construction was on hold. Despite the extra time, Zvezda failed to meet Nasa safety standards for noise and micrometeoroid protection. Mufflers and shields eventually will be added; in the meantime, everyone inside, Atlantis' crew included, will have earplugs. </p> <p>Space shuttle Discovery must follow with the first piece of space station truss, or framework, before the first permanent residents can move in at the beginning of November. </p> <p>Altogether, Nasa plans eight shuttle flights to the space station over the next year, beginning with Atlantis' mission. </p> <p>\"We made use of the delays to get our hardware ready, and now it's time to show that we can deliver on what we said we were going to do,\" said Robert Cabana, manager of space station international operations. </p> <p>The high point will be the launch of the US lab Destiny in January. At that point, the international space station will be larger than Russia's Mir. That is also when controllers in Houston will take over day-to-day space station operations from their counterparts in Moscow.</p> <p>Russia is supposed to supply more cargo ships and more space station components. But because of the country's financial crisis, everything beyond this year is in question. </p> <p>Atlantis is due back on September 19, although Nasa hopes to conserve enough power to extend the mission by one day.</p>",
  "A guided missile from a Russian warship sank the Russian submarine Kursk, a German newspaper has reported. <p>The report in the Berliner Zeitung daily said that FSB domestic intelligence service chief Nikolai Patruschev had handed a report to President Vladimir Putin which said the \"Granit\" missile had been fired by the Russian warship Peter the Great as part of an exercise that had been going on since early August - killing all 118 people on board.</p> <p>However, Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov as saying there was no shooting under way at the time of the disaster, and that no live warheads would have been used during the training exercises. Navy spokesman Igor Dygalo also said no live ammunition would have been used, and said the two ships would not have been operating within striking range. \"In the process of exercises such an accident is strictly excluded because surface ships and submarines operate within strictly defined training zones,\" Interfax quoted him as saying. </p> <p>But the German newspaper said both the head of the Northern Fleet, Admiral Vyacheslav Popov, and its chief of staff, Vice-Admiral Mikhail Mozak, had been on board the warship on August 12, the day of the accident. </p> <p>The report did not say why the missile had hit the Kursk, but speculated that it may have been an error in a new weapon system or that the Kursk was not recognised as a friendly craft. </p> <p>The two explosions caused by the missile were visible from the bridge of the Peter the Great, the paper said. Russian officials have suggested a foreign submarine may have collided with the Kursk, causing it to sink with all 118 people on board. There was no immediate comment from the FSB in Moscow.</p>",

  "France's fuel tax standoff escalated further yesterday as serious fissures began to appear in the ruling coalition and the European commission threatened legal action to maintain the free movement of goods. <p>With some 80 % of the country's petrol stations either empty, under tight rationing or reserved for the emergency services, taxi drivers became the latest group to join the campaign for fuel tax cuts, causing traffic chaos in more than a dozen cities with massed \"go-slow\" protests. </p> <p>Farmers declared there was no prospect of them withdrawing from the barricades they are helping road hauliers to man outside 125 oil refineries and fuel depots around France. </p> <p>Dodging riot police, several hundred farmers succeeded in blocking the entrance to the Channel tunnel at Calais late yesterday afternoon, leading to angry confrontations with motorists. The blockade was later temporarily lifted to allow furious British holidaymakers on to the shuttle. </p> <p>Other farmers drove tractors and trailers on to train tracks outside Strasbourg and Bordeaux, bringing high-speed TGVs in the east and west to a standstill for most of the day. </p> <p>Nantes, Nice and Rennes airports reported they had all but run out of aviation fuel, school meals went undelivered in the Vosges, emergency-only petrol stations went dry in Brittany, and police were called in to guard requisitioned pumps in Lyons. </p> <p>For the first time in the four-day blockade, the French capital began to feel the pinch. While surrounding fuel depots were largely kept open by armed riot police, Paris petrol stations began to run out of fuel, particularly diesel, in increasing numbers. </p> <p>Furious at the fuel tax cuts already offered to the road hauliers, the Green party, a minority member of the Socialist-led coalition, warned the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, that it would react \"forcefully\" if any more concessions were made to road users. </p> <p>\"I back the cabinet that I am a member of, but I want to remind everyone that I joined it on the understanding that we would work for clean air and for moving away from road to rail transport,\" said the environment minister, Dominique Voynet. </p> <p>She had demanded an urgent meeting with Mr Jospin and said the Greens \"were not in this government in order to do the exact opposite of what we were elected to do\". </p> <p>Mr Jospin said on Wednesday night there would be no further negotiations with the hauliers and the government's offer was final. </p> <p>In Brussels, the European commission sent a formal request to Paris \"concerning a possible obstacle to the free movement of goods\", spokesman Jonathan Todd said. France would be violating EU law if it did not ensure its frontiers and main routes were kept open to goods traffic, he said.</p>",
  "Gordon Brown's closest trade union ally has accused his fellow TUC leaders of playing a \"very dangerous game\" by backing Britain's early entry into the euro, and thereby risking losing a promised referendum that could be won by the government by holding it when the time was right. <p>In a move reflecting the chancellor's determination to control policy on the single currency, Bill Morris, leader of the transport union, said the euro enthusiasts, who include TUC general secretary John Monks, were \"running down the pound\" and \"preaching doom and gloom\". </p> <p>In an interview with the New Statesman magazine ahead of the TUC conference in Glasgow, Mr Morris insisted it should be the government that ought to \"lead the debate on the euro\", and he ridiculed claims that millions of British jobs could be lost by staying out of the single currency. </p> <p>The chancellor has appointed Mr Morris to the court of the Bank of England, and, as if to emphasise the closeness of his view to those of the chancellor's, Mr Morris also published a Mori opinion poll showing a 10% net increase in the proportion of those prepared to back entry by Britain if the five convergence tests stipulated by Mr Brown were met. </p> <p>Mr Morris's curtain raiser for the TUC euro debate next week - the chancellor will address the congress on Tuesday - was made as it emerged that Tony Blair has agreed to a formal structure of regular Downing Street meetings with the TUC for the first time since Labour returned to office. </p> <p>In a sign of warming relations after what Mr Monks described as a \"productive but patchy\" first three years, there will be an official quarterly meeting between the two sides, backed with exchanges of position papers and a joint secretariat. </p> <p>The arrangements, which supersede present ad hoc contacts, will also bring in other ministers when necessary, and follow moves for a more systematic relationship between the TUC and the trade and industry department under Stephen Byers. </p> <p>But Mr Blair is still resistant to pressure from the unions to establish any broader tripartite \"social partnership\", bringing together government, unions and employers, as is common throughout the rest of the EU. </p> <p>Although there are what Mr Monks calls \"oases of tripartism\" in Britain (such as the low pay commission and the health and safety executive) the government is reluctant to raise the spectre of 1970s-style corporatism as practiced by previous governments, though the TUC argues that use of such bodies can avoid the damage caused by \"parallel lobbying\" by unions and employers. </p> <p>Mr Monks yesterday pointed to a \"surge\" of recognition agreements with employers as evidence that \"unions now find themselves in the most favourable political and economic context for more than 30 years\", although membership growth has been hit by job losses in manufacturing. </p> <p>He also said that the TUC would press the Labour party to adopt three policies in particular for the next parliament. </p> <p>It wants a legal obligation on employers to provide training for workers, the provision of company information and consultation rights for British workers, and complete protection of the terms and conditions of public sector employees whose work is transferred to the private sector.</p>",
  "The dome's financial director is expected to be sacked today. Labour MPs meanwhile joined the chorus calling for the head of Lord Falconer, the minister with ultimate responsibility for the fiasco. <p>Neil Spence, the accountant who has presided over the \"black hole\" in the dome's books, was waiting to hear of his fate from David James, the City troubleshooter brought in to keep the attraction open. </p> <p>Lord Falconer, a commercial lawyer and close friend of the prime minister, was called an \"endearing amateur\" by Martin O'Neill, the influential chairman of the trade and industry select committee. There is also a growing belief among Labour MPs that even if he rides the present storm, he could be sunk by a national audit office report into the dome next month. </p> <p>A spokesman for Mr James, who was highly critical of the lack of proper records of the dome's assets and contracts, said he \"could not guarantee\" that Mr Spence would survive his shake-up. </p> <p>Mr Spence has already been in effect replaced by John Darlington, chief executive of the Robinson Group, whom Mr James drafted in to oversee the proposed sale to Nomura. The last part of Mr Spence's job, dealing with cash flow, has been handed over to an accountant from PricewaterhouseCoopers. </p> <p>Mr O'Neill's carefully couched criticism of Lord Falconer comes as a major blow to his chances of clinging on. Even though Mr O'Neill stopped short of demanding his dismissal, he said a government minister from the Commons should now be put in charge of the dome to improve accountability. </p> <p>\"The lack of proper scrutiny and control over the spending suggests a naivety on behalf of the political masters of the project,\" said Mr O'Neill. </p> <p>\"They were not asking the right questions and addressing the issues as we expect. There is about members of the House of Lords in charge of important projects a sense of the endearing amateur, a sort of Lord Peter Wimsey.\" </p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn, Labour MP for Islington North, went further. \"I think the Prime Minister is protecting him because he's very close to him, because he's a friend of his, and I would think at the very least Lord Falconer should consider his position, and perhaps resign.\" </p> <p>Even if Lord Falconer gets over these hurdles, he will have to weather the Commons public accounts committee, which will question officials from the dome, millennium commission and culture department on November 24. </p> <p>Downing Street, however, rallied behind the beleaguered minister and said Mr Blair believed he was doing \"a good job in difficult circumstances\". A spokesman added that Mr Blair - whose family have yet to visit the dome - had no plans to visit the complex. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats, who have held back from calling for his resignation until now, piled on the pressure. </p> <p>Spokesman Norman Baker said: \"I am afraid that Lord Falconer must answer the calls for his resignation and go. He has overseen this project for two years and should have done far more to prevent what has now become a national embarrassment. </p> <p>\"The Tories must also take some of the blame. The idea of the dome was theirs. They created its shaky financial arrangements and insisted on the shroud of secrecy which has surrounded the dome ever since.\" </p> <p>With the news that the dome's closing extravaganza was finally cancelled yesterday, even its most vocal supporter, the former Tory deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine, admitted serious errors had been made. </p> <p>Mr Heseltine, who sits on the millennium commission which gave the dome an extra \u00a347m on Monday, said it should have had the power to hire \"a great entrepreneur with creative flair from the very beginning\". </p> <p>He accused his party leader William Hague of scoring \"easy political points\" for calling for the dome to shut now. </p> <p>Mr Hague hit back: \"It has become worse than a national embarrassment and it ought now to be closed.\" </p> <p>The thorny issue of bonuses to the dome's directors took another twist last night, when a New Millennium Experience Company source revealed that he \"did not expect anyone to get their full money\". </p> <p>Directors are entitled to bonuses of up to 30% of their total earnings at the dome and Jennie Page, who was sacked as chief executive in January, is thought to have walked away with her \u00a3150,000 bonus intact. </p> <p>The bonuses will be decided at the end of the year by the board. </p> <p>Yesterday it also emerged that the dome's sponsors, who played a key role in the sacking of Ms Page, would have sued to get their money back if it had closed early. \"We all want the dome to stay open to the end of the year as it was supposed to,\" said a spokesman for Boots, which sponsors the Body zone.</p>",
  "When William Hague approached the podium in Birmingham on Tuesday to launch his party's latest policy document, Believing in Britain, he did so to an unfamiliar tune. Gone was the traditional Conservative party fanfare Land and Hope of Glory and in its place the strains of Man Next Door by Massive Attack boomed from the speakers. <p>To the party's image consultants it must have seemed the perfect combination for the modern Conservatives: the sound of urban Britain combined with a homely theme. There was just one problem - the band abhors everything the party stands for and yesterday announced that they would be consulting their lawyers. </p> <p>\"Massive Attack have not and will never support the Conservative party or their policies,\" the Bristol-based dance band said. </p> <p>\"If our music has been used by the Tories it is without our knowledge or our permission. The misappropriation of our music by any organisation or broadcaster will be dealt with in the strongest way we can.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the band's management company said: \"The Tories couldn't have picked a worse band politically. Massive's political leanings are far more to the left than Hague, although I'm not sure they would give permission to any political party to use their music. </p> <p>Last night Conservative central office was keen to play down the incident. \"It's a massive attack over nothing,\" said a spokesman. \"The music was for background and was not intended for broadcast.\" </p> <p>The spokesman was unable to comment on whether Mr Hague is a fan of the band but said it was popular among staff at Smith Square.</p>",
  "Colombian police officers have found a 30m-long submarine, designed to smuggle cocaine, being built in a secret workshop 400 miles from the country's Caribbean coast. <p>Agents found the vessel in mountains near the Colombian capital Bogota on Wednesday. No arrests were made but documents found at the site show that the smugglers planned to transport the submarine to the Caribbean. Instructions on how to build a submarine, written in Russian and translated into Spanish, were found nearby. </p> <p>\"It sounds like a fairy story, but it is true. The drug barons are developing more and more sophisticated methods to ship cocaine,\" said the national police chief, General Luis Ernesto Gilibert. \"The technology used was advanced.\" </p> <p>Law enforcement officials say Colombian drug barons - who produce up to 520 tonnes of cocaine each year - are collaborating with the Russian mafia to exploit new markets in eastern Europe. However, a spokesman for the Russian embassy said there is little sign that Russian criminals are actively involved in smuggling from Colombia. </p> <p>\"It seems very unlikely. We have a much bigger problem with smuggling through Asia,\" he said. Police technicians estimate the submarine cost $5 m (\u00a33.3m) to build. It is not the first \"narco-sub\" to be found in Colombia but it is certainly the largest, with accommodation for three people and a cargo bay big enough to carry up to 15 tonnes of cocaine. </p> <p>In 1993, officers found a crude submarine in the Caribbean port of Santa Marta. It was used to smuggle shipments of 1.5 tonnes to Panama.</p>",
  "Fathers will be allowed to take two weeks of paid paternity leave under radical plans to give parents more time to care for their children. <p>The idea is favoured by a group of ministers examining ways of improving parental leave without antagonising business leaders. </p> <p>Stephen Byers, trade and industry secretary, yesterday called on employers to recognise the importance of child caring. Many parents were trying to juggle \"the responsibility of being a good parent with holding down a job\", he said as he launched a consultation on changes to parental leave. </p> <p>The government is to publish a green paper this year outlining changes to entitlements; giving fathers two weeks' paid leave after the birth of their child is expected to among the main proposals. At present they are entitled to 13 weeks' unpaid leave if they have children, up to age five. </p> <p>Under the new proposal, the leave would have to be taken immediately after the birth to allow companies to plan for an employee's absence. </p> <p>One ministerial source said the aim was to balance the demands of campaigners, who want fathers to be allowed to choose when to take their leave, with the needs of employers, who are wary of improving parental leave. </p> <p>\"A lot of people work shifts, and their absence has to be covered by someone else,\" the source said. \"The people who are calling for a more flexible system come from the world of researchers and academics, who are a minority.\" </p> <p>Ministers are likely to struggle to win the support of business for the proposal. This week the Confederation of British Industry called on the government to resist demands for paid parental leave. </p> <p>Digby Jones, CBI director general, said his members feared ministers were planning new legislation on workers' rights in an appeal to Labour's core supporters before the election. \"Enough is enough,\" he said. \"We have had 16 pieces of employment legislation in two years. I hope Tony Blair and Gordon Brown will behave like statesmen and put the country first.\" </p> <p>Mr Byers said the aim was to ensure that new measures were not harmful to business. \"Particular attention will need to be given to the effect on small business.\"</p>",
  "<p>The decision to keep rates on hold for the seventh month in a row may have been boring, but you can bet your life that the chat at yesterday's meeting of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee was anything but. </p> <p>After last month's cliffhanging five-four decision in favour of \"no change,\" the committee was probably just as divided over the rate decision yesterday. There will still have been those worried that private sector spending is not slowing rapidly enough to allow room for Gordon Brown's generous public sector spending plans to kick in, while the doves on the committee will have been cheered by a decline in earnings growth and a further easing of the property boom. </p> <p>The joker in the pack has been the exchange rate. While sterling is testing seven-year lows against the dollar, the euro's tumble on the foreign exchanges has once again ratcheted up the pressure on manufacturers struggling to export to Europe. Because firms buy most of their raw materials and fuel in dollars, the current situation is the worst of all possible worlds, but from the Bank's standpoint the overall impact of the exchange rate is little changed since it last met. </p> <p>The Bank declined to act last month despite its own forecasts showing inflation above its 2.5% target in two years' time. It would have been inconsistent for it to have raised rates yesterday after a month of conflicting signals from the economy. Doing nothing yesterday might have been boring, but it was the right thing. </p> <p><strong> Invensys sinks </strong><br> </p> <p> Those who believe mergers destroy as much value as they create will be adding Invensys - the tie-up between Siebe and BTR - to their textbook studies unless a turnaround is effected pretty sharpish. The company yesterday reported trading difficulties in many of its core areas and, ominously, in software, where it has just forked out \u00a3470m to take majority control of the troubled Dutch group Baan. </p> <p>Invensys' Canadian-born chief executive, Allen Yurko, blames an array of market difficulties - such as a slowdown in US residential building and a reduction in demand from the oil and gas sector as well as reductions in semi-conductor prices. Unsurprisingly, the City was sceptical of these claims pointing out that the US economy is booming, oil prices are rocketing and software sales are up everywhere. </p> <p>Analysts accept that Invensys is sitting at the top engineering table where competition between Honeywell, Emerson and Schreiber is intense. But what value the merger of Siebe and BTR with the thousands of job losses and sales of businesses if it were not to make Invensys leaner, fitter and able to weather a storm? </p> <p>So the markets gave Mr Yurko a serious clout on the head yesterday. A 37% share price fall in a Footsie company in a single day is almost unheard of. </p> <p>One thing in particular which has stuck in the City's collective craw is the admission that software margins are being squeezed. </p> <p>Having sold off businesses such as automotive products, environmental technology and aerospace operations, Invernsys faces a real question over whether it really needed to move into software. If it was an attempt to bring a bit of e-glamour to a business rooted in the old economy, it has all gone horribly wrong. </p> <p><strong> Stout surfeit </strong><br> </p> <p>Are the Irish finally falling out of love with the creamy black stuff? It appears so, according to Diageo, which yesterday revealed that sales of Guinness had fallen in the Emerald Isle for the first time. </p> <p>The 4% decline is hardly cause to sell shares in the world's biggest drinks company. But it does point to a longer-term trend - Diageo blamed Ireland's booming economic growth , which means \"people are doing other things, rather than just going to the pub\". </p> <p>The problem, for Diageo is that Guinness has traditionally been the drink of the working man in Ireland. It hardly ranks alongside vodka and Red Bull as a trendy tipple for young, urban Dubliners or for the legions of employees of the country's burgeoning hi-tech industry. </p> <p>In countries where Guinness has been introduced much more recently the drink is doing fine - because it is associated with Rutger Hauer's stylish marketing patter and with glossy advertisements showing horses bursting through waves. </p> <p>Such a renaissance could take a while in the drink's home territory, where Guinness will always be the devil's buttermilk first produced by Arthur Guinness in 1759. Perhaps europhobes who want an example of the euro throwing an economy out of kilter and in the process doing serious damage to a country's cultural heritage should take up the issue.</p>",

  "<p>Stephen Carter, the advertising executive who had been tipped to land the job of ITV Network chief executive, has instead accepted a job at cable company NTL. </p> <p>Mr Carter will join NTL as chief operating officer from advertising agency J Walter Thompson. The agency acts for NTL and came up with the cable firm's slogan \"technology tamed\". </p> <p>The appointment was viewed as a clear admission that the cable industry is in dire need of a bit of marketing nous. Cable &amp; Wireless Communications, which NTL recently bought, is commonly among the most fiercely criticised companies in Britain for its poor levels of service. </p> <p>Mr Carter's decision to accept the job at NTL is a further embarrassment for ITV which has struggled to fill its chief executive slot for nine months. He is reported to have turned ITV down two weeks ago. </p> <p>The ITV job was vacated when Richard Eyre left to join Pearson TV in January and a succession of candidates have decided against joining the network at the 11th hour. </p> <p>Others understood to have snubbed ITV include Richard Hytner, chief executive of advertising agency Publicis, Dominic Proctor, chief executive of Mindshare and Peter Littlewood of confectionary group Mars. The job carries a package of about \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>Mr Carter, who was chief executive of J Walter Thompson, will replace Leigh Wood who the company said was standing down at the end of next March to spend more time with her husband and four children. </p> <p>Barclay Knapp, NTL chief executive, said Mr Carter's background made him a good replacement. \"His track record in building successful consumer brands comes at a perfect time in NTL's stage of development,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Carter had been at J Walter Thompson since joining its graduate trainee scheme after completing a law degree at Aberdeen university. </p> <p>He became managing director of the London office in 1994 and took over as chief executive of the group, owned by WPP, three years later. </p> <p>NTL's chief rival, Telewest yesterday said it would resume marketing its digital cable TV service on October 1 after overcoming a shortage of set-top boxes which had flattened the group's share price over the summer. Chief executive Adam Singer said the group has \"all the boxes we need until the end of the year\". </p> <p>The introduction of digital has caused BSkyB to surge ahead of its cable rivals which have suffered a series of delays to their own launches.

  "The case of the Siamese twins, Jodie and Mary, is a parent's worst nightmare. Jodie, according to evidence in the court hearings, is a \"bright and alert baby, sparkling and sucking on her dummy\"; her sister Mary's state is \"pitiable\" - she cannot even cry, because she has no lungs of her own. Mary depends on Jodie for her blood and oxygen. She is incapable of independent life but is slowly draining her conjoined sister, and unless they are separated, both will die within six months. The doctors in charge of the case want to save Jodie, which would mean killing Mary. The parents insist that God's will be done and that nature should be left to take its course. The only way to resolve the deadlock in this agonising dilemma has been to resort to the courts. Not surprisingly, the appeal court judges and the barristers admit to sleepless nights as they wrestle with the ethical and emotional implications. <p>Part of that perhaps arises from the sense that the law is not the right arbiter in this extremely unusual and delicate situation. The parents and the official solicitor acting on Mary's behalf have appealed against the high court decision for the operation to go ahead and the lawyers are debating fine legal points along the murky boundary between what is an unlawful killing and what constitutes \"withdrawal of treatment\". But the crux of this case is not to be found in such legal issues, but in a broader consideration of what is in the best interests of all - both parents and children. </p> <p>It seems common sense that the right thing to do is to save one life, rather than lose both. But it is also common sense that the parents' wishes lie at the heart of the case. The Manchester hospital where the children are being treated has been inundated by members of the public protesting at the parents being overruled in the high-court judgment. Of course, in some cases we understand that parents' rights can be superseded by the state's responsibility to protect children's rights; for example, the state can overrule a Jehovah's Witness parent's refusal to allow a healthy child to have a blood transfusion. </p> <p>But this is not such a case. In addition to the anguish the parents feel at one of their daughters dying and their own moral objections to this as devout Catholics, the benefits for Jodie are not even clear. There are serious questions about the quality of Jodie's life after the operation; the parents are certain that the health service in their home country and their financial situation would prevent them from caring properly for her if she was seriously disabled. They would perhaps have to leave her behind for fostering in England. In such circumstances how can the court enforce the operation even if it is ethically the right thing to do? After all, it will be the parents who will be left to carry the can. No, given the age and vulnerability of both the twins, this case has to be regarded as a question of private morality, leaving the state no right to intervene.</p>",
  "Either George Monbiot wrote his article on Conservative policy towards Nafta (Vote Tory for a federal superstate, September 7) before bothering to find out what our policy was, or he believes some very strange consequences indeed flow from free trade. Our policy is to support a free trade agreement between the EU and Nafta, to extend the free-trade zone across the Atlantic, as a prelude to global free trade by 2020. This was set out in our European election manifesto last year and it is the policy contained in our document Believing in Britain, published this week. <p>Such an arrangement would benefit not just Britain but the EU as a whole - and, indeed, it would also benefit the members of Nafta. Trade is the greatest engine of prosperity and progress there has ever been. A modern, outward-looking European Union would be embracing such policies with open arms. </p> <p>Conservatives believe that Britain does not have to choose between Europe and America.

But David Korten, a highly respected academic, was an observer at a meeting hosted by ambassador Razali Ismail, president of the general assembly, on June 24 1997. The president, he reported, announced \"that a framework for the involvement of the corporate sector in UN decision-making would be worked out under the auspices of the commission on sustainable development\". </p> <p>Soon afterwards, a leaked memo from Unctad (UN Conference on Trade and Development) revealed that such preposterous ideas were already being implemented: \"There is close cooperation with the ICC [International Chamber of Commerce] in helping countries to formulate competition and consumer protection law and policy.\" </p> <p>Mr Ruggie claims that the UN secretary-general \"did not launch the business humanitarian forum\". But Mr Annan wrote the speech with which the forum's first meeting began. Mr Ruggie insists that the forum is not co-chaired by the UN high commissioner for refugees. Indeed it isn't but, as I suggested, it was last year. He also insists \"no logo was developed\" for the UN Development Programme's pact with business.

  "My god, I thought it would be so different. All so very different. Who will ever forget the sheer, joyous, fan-bloody-tastic feeling of mind-blowing exhilaration we all felt on that bright, confident dawn of May 2 1997, after New Labour had swept to power? <p>This is what I wrote at the time, as part of a text that is still studied in media courses around the land: \"After 18 long, hard years, the forces of good have triumphed, sleaze has been vanquished and this poor benighted country has been instantly transformed. </p> <p>\"Under Tony Blair, no child need ever look plaintively up at a tree, unable to reach for that rosy apple. </p> <p>\"Under Tony Blair, no senior citizen at a supermarket till need ever fumble for loose change in an old coat. </p> <p>\"Under Tony Blair, no discontented youth need ever again perform an armed robbery on a sub-post office in order to be able to afford a brand new motor-scooter. </p> <p>\"Under Tony Blair, there will be no greenhouse effect, no BSE, no negative equity, no traffic snarl-ups on the M25, no deaths from drunk-driving, no feuds in Northern Ireland, no toxic waste, no increased bank charges and no inner-city kiddies under- performing in their GCSEs. </p> <p>\"Under Tony Blair, Britain will be transformed into a land of hope and plenty, a land from which we will all be filled with a new glow of confidence to march into a golden future. Hail Tony! Hail New Labour! And welcome, my friends: welcome to tomorrow!\" </p> <p>Reading this text today, over three years on, I have every reason to feel disenchanted.

  "Relatives of the 29 people killed in the Omagh atrocity broke down and wept yesterday as they watched for the first time horrifying amateur videos shot immediately after the Real IRA car bomb blast. The footage included sickening images of the dead and dying. <p>Several families left the inquest to watch the three videos, lasting about 10 minutes, in a side room. Their wailing could be heard outside, and they said afterwards that the sounds of screaming on the footage were as upsetting as the gruesome pictures. </p> <p>Greater Belfast coroner John Leckey is presiding over the inquest into the deaths of 29 people, killed when a 500lb car bomb went off in the Co Tyrone town on August 15, 1998. It is expected to last four weeks, and yesterday was the second day of the hearing. </p> <p>Only a short clip of the first video to be shown yesterday has been screened on television news. None of the rest of the footage has been shown. </p> <p>Michael Gallagher, whose son Aidan, 21, died in the explosion, said: \"I thought at first how could someone stand there and video a scene like that. Now I am glad they did. The opportunity should be given so everyone can see it, so that they can see the true horror of Omagh.\" </p> <p>Mario Radford, whose son Alan, 16, was also killed, said: \"When I saw the videos. I could not believe one human being could contemplate such destruction on another. It makes me angry these people are walking the streets. I have never felt anger or bitterness, but I do want justice. </p> <p>\"It was my solicitor who pointed Alan's body out to me. I was very near him. I don't know how I couldn't find him. I would probably have ended up in a mental hospital if I had.\" </p> <p>The first film to be shown depicted an injured girl, aged about 13, wandering in a daze close to the bomb scene. She was crying: \"Where's mummy? Where's mummy?\" </p> <p>The background sound of screaming was constant, and a badly injured woman, her face bloody, staggered about in shock. Her hands were raised and she constantly cried: \"Oh my God. Oh my God.\" </p> <p>As several people crouched over one victim, a man desperately instructed them on first aid. He said: \"Keep the pressure on it. Hold pressure on it. Hard. Keep pressure on it.\" </p> <p>One of the dead or injured was shown being carried away in a tattered red tarpaulin. A little girl was being helped to an ambulance. </p> <p>The second video had a commentary from the man filming it. He had an Australian accent. He said: \"You just would not believe this. You just would not believe what has fucking happened. The centre of the town had been wrecked by a fucking bomb two minutes again, less than that. You would not fucking believe it. So much for the fucking peace process.\" </p> <p>His video was filled with the sound of crunching glass underfoot. At one point a woman shouted: \"Somebody help me. Somebody help me.\" </p> <p>Mr Leckey said the video was important because it showed that a water mains had been ruptured. That hampered the rescue, because victims and body parts moved under the force of the water. </p> <p>In the third video there was a glimpse of the remains of a body, looking like a slab of raw meat. There was also a severed leg, partly covered in a bin-liner. In both cases, the operator quickly averted his camera. </p> <p>One woman was lying on the ground alongside another, comforting her. The victim was motionless. </p> <p>The camera swept along a bus used to ferry the injured to hospital. They had a catalogue of bloody injuries, and were in shock. One girl, her back terribly ripped, was supported by two friends. She lolled as if unconscious. </p> <p>One man said: \"Look for bodies. Keep your eyes going.\" Another muttered: \"They were only doing their shopping.\" A third said: \"Terrible. Terrible.\" </p> <p>Patsy McElhatton, 59, a member of the Fintona cycling club, shot one of the videos, believed to be the third. He had his camera with him because of a club event. </p> <p>Mr McElhatton said outside the inquest: \"I was down at the scene less than four minutes after it went off. I knew a lot of people there, and, as I was filming, I was wondering why am I doing this? But I thought at least this will be shown around the world, and people will know what a bomb can do.\" </p> <p>He had handed the video to police, after considering getting rid of it. </p> <p>Mr McElhatton said: \"The full horror of it all only hit me seven weeks ago. I won't walk down that street anymore. I wish I was never there, to tell you the truth.\" </p> <p>The Police Federation in Northern Ireland announced it was appointing counsel to represent all of its members appearing at the inquiry. The move follows tough questioning of police witnesses over their reactions to the three confused bomb warnings, and has divided the families. </p> <p>Michael Mansfield QC, appearing for Lawrence Rush, widower of Libby, 57, and Barry Fox, an Omagh solicitor representing the families of victims Esther Gibson, 36, and Avril Monaghan, 30, and her daughter Maura, 18 months, have led the probing. They are focusing on police procedures. </p> <p>Ken Duncan, a solicitor for the family of Deborah Anne Cartwright, 20, who also died, objected. He wanted the questioning halted until the officers' legal teams arrived, and, after debate, the video evidence was taken. </p> <p>Mr Leckey will rule this morning on whether he will subpoena Francie Mackey, the Omagh-based chairman of the 32-County Sovereignty Movement.

She was their daughter-in-law.\" Underneath this is a reprint of the Daily Mail front page of September 4 1992, revealing Diana's affair with James Gilbey. Alexander Hitchen, Mr Al Fayed's spokesman, denies any involvement, and since the Egyptian must be able to spell his name you have to believe him.

Now, however, in a long editorial rant headlined This Wretched Mess, he thunders: \"It will stand in the public's memory as a monument to the vanity of big-headed and pig-headed politicians.\" Yes, and to the wretched crawling to their proprietor's other media interest of bald-headed editors. Now do buck up, man, and for God's sake get a grip.</p> <p>\u0095 Another editor comes to our attention. At the Royal Albert Hall on Wednesday, the Independent on Sunday's Janet Street-Porter met someone from the Observer and related how she once clocked an offending hack with her handbag. She then realised what brought this to mind: the Observer man, she decided, looked a bit like me. I am tempted to chant \"Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough\"; but on reflection the old girl is plenty hard enough, so I think we'll let it lie.</p> <p>\u0095 \"Someone's got to ask,\" writes Express columnist Kathryn Knight. \"Were the Beatles that great?\" Yes, Kathryn, they were. That's why, 30 years after the split, your paper gave two pages yesterday to a new book. \"Their music's not bad,\" (you're very kind), \"but weren't they just a bunch of lads with mop tops strumming guitars.\" No, they weren't. Nervous columnists traditionally crave that comforting blanket of journalism, the bulging postbag, but there are idiocies about sex, drugs, race etc, to get readers going without resorting to rot about the Beatles.</p> <p>\u0095 In Ankara, police are hunting a mugger who may be auditioning for a Turkish remake of Batman. In recent months, the Tickler has cornered 300 victims in alleyways and tickled them until they coughed up. \"It's no laughing matter,\" an Ankara police spokesman told us yesterday. Or might have done if we'd had the energy to call.</p>",
  "The United Nations yesterday evacuated virtually all foreign employees of international organisations and many local staff from Indonesian West Timor, a day after three UN workers were murdered by pro-Jakarta militiamen. <p>The Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, who is in New York for the millennium summit, blamed his political opponents for orchestrating the crisis to embarrass him. The Indonesian military, which did little to intervene during Wednesday's attack in the town of Atambua, tried to play down the incident, saying it was \"a local brawl that got out of hand\". </p> <p>Four battalions of Indonesian army reinforcements prepared to head to West Timor in a bid to restore order yesterday, as the UN flew its workers and staff of international non-governmental organisations to safety in Bali. </p> <p>\"We left Kupang [the regional capital] for the airport in a convoy of 101 people at 5.30am,\" said Andrew Harper, programme coordinator for the UN high commissioner for refugees in West Timor. \"We had a military and police escort and there were police at all the major intersections.\" </p> <p>These precautions were deemed necessary following widespread rumours that the militia were heading for Kupang from Atambua. Residents of the town were visibly worried yesterday. A woman said many people were packing up and preparing to head to the hills, or out of Timor, if the situation deteriorated. </p> <p>Another 69 people, mostly local staff of international organisations, crossed from Atambua into East Timor with the bodies of the three murdered UNHCR staff, said Mr Harper. \"There will be another flight tomorrow from Kupang for the remaining 50 national and two international staff still there,\" he added. </p> <p>In Jakarta, the Indonesian security minister, Susilio Bambang Yudhoyono, said 15 people had been arrested in connection with the attack on the UNHCR office and the ensuing riot. Another person had been arrested for the murder of a militia leader the previous evening that allegedly sparked Wednesday's rampage. </p> <p>The Indonesian military, elements of which are widely accused of actively supporting the militias in West Timor, seemed less concerned by their failure to protect the UN staff. \"What happened was just a local brawl that got out of hand,\" a senior spokesman, Air Marshal Graito Usodo, told a press conference. </p> <p>President Wahid did not share these sentiments. Speaking on the sidelines of the millennium summit in New York, he said the Atambua incident was the latest episode in a protracted campaign to topple him. \"This happened when I am here in New York, at the UN, to embarrass me.\" </p> <p>Mr Harper disagreed. He blamed the government for not disarming the militia and separating them from the approximately 130,000 refugees from East Timor who are still camping in squalid conditions, one year after the militia forced them out of their home land after East Timor's overwhelming independence vote. </p> <p>\"The authorities do not have control in many areas,\" he said. \"What happened [on Wednesday] demonstrates clearly that they cannot guarantee our security, even though they promised to last October.\" Then the Indonesian government signed a memorandum of understanding with the UN, promising to provide sufficient security for humanitarian workers and to ensure that the refugees had safe access to them. </p> <p>In the last year the militia, a mixture of pro-Jakarta East Timorese paramilitaries, West Timorese thugs and members of the Indonesian military, have attacked and intimidated almost half the refugees into staying in West Timor. In the last few weeks they have focused mainly on intimidating the UNHCR staff, who are responsible for organising the repatriation to East Timor.</p>",
  "The chances of the US president, Bill Clinton, securing a Middle East peace settlement receded yesterday after the White House admitted he had failed to make any progress in talks at the UN millennium summit. <p>Mr Clinton held separate discussions with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat, on the fringes of the summit. The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said he could report no progress on the contentious issue of control of Jerusalem and that no further meetings were planned. </p> <p>Time is running out for Mr Clinton, with the US presidential election only two months away and Mr Barak's coalition government facing collapse next month. </p> <p>More pressing, Mr Arafat and his colleagues will meet this weekend to decide whether unilaterally to declare Palestinian independence on September 13, as they had threatened unless a deal was in place. The Palestinian delegation said the declaration could be delayed. </p> <p>Mr Clinton had been desperate to secure a Middle East settlement as the main legacy of his presidency. </p> <p>He met Mr Barak and Mr Arafat on the upper floor of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in an attempt to see if there was a compromise that would complete the deal almost secured in July at Camp David. But White House officials said the positions had slipped back since then. </p> <p>Mr Arafat, in his speech to the millennium summit, took an uncompromising stance, declaring that Palestine should have sovereignty over Arab east Jerusalem, ditching the possibility of a compromise that might have seen the city share sovereignty or come under international control. </p> <p>Mr Arafat told the summit that the Palestinians had already made painful sacrifices for peace. </p> <p>An Israeli official said nothing could happen in the peace negotiations until Mr Arafat demonstrated he was ready to discuss ideas offered at or since Camp David. </p> <p>The public mood in Israel swung from anticipation to gloom yesterday after President Clinton failed to break the deadlock. </p> <p>The acting foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, warned against over-optimism at the prospects of reaching a peace agreement while Mr Clinton remains in power. </p> <p>The mood darkened perceptibly as Israeli negotiators said there was no further room for manoeuvre with the Palestinians.\" We cannot be more flexible in our stances regarding Jerusalem,\" Gilead Sher, a negotiator, told Israel's army radio. </p> <p>Although the focus of negotiations since the collapse of the Camp David summit in July has been the status of Jerusalem, Mr Ben Ami emphasised that there were wide gaps between the two sides on refugees, as well as on less contentious issues like borders and settlements. \"We should not make the mistake of thinking that some symbolic compromise that Arafat agrees to on the Temple Mount solves the rest of the problems,\" he said.</p>",
  "Harvey Hinds, who has died aged 80, was a clergyman, youth worker, educationist and leading Labour local government politician. His superb organisational and people skills - frequently exercised behind the scenes - came to the fore during the years 1967-83 when he was chief whip of the often volatile Labour group on the Greater London Council. <p>When the long-time Labour leader Sir Reg Goodwin resigned in 1980, Hinds recognised that the next administration would need to respond to the massive social shift which had taken place in London during the 1970s upheaval: he desperately wanted a change from the old-style Labour leaders who paid more attention to officers than to their elected colleagues. </p> <p>Following the 1981 election, with a majority of just nine, the Labour Group was split - left 22, right 18 and centre 10. Wanting a leader who would give a clear lead and implement change, he saw the best hope in Ken Livingstone and a new generation of talented young politicians, rather than a continuation of the old guard. </p> <p>With Illtyd Harrington, as deputy leader, Hinds used his influence to lead the vital centre block of votes into the Livingstone camp to create an administration which was to change the face of politics in London. </p> <p>But with numbers so tight, there was always the risk of the right voting with the Tories on occasions. Gradually, the tensions within the Labour group began to subside and, as Ken Livingstone was the first to recognise, this was largely due to Hinds' work as chief whip in managing to defuse the complaints of the often outraged right about the latest left-wing proposal. </p> <p>Politics came into his life relatively late. Born into a Worcester fruit-growing family, he blossomed as a scholarship boy at King's School, Worcester, where his wide-ranging interests included singing in the cathedral, and he became head of his house. An exhibitioner at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, he read French and German before changing to philosophy, politics and economics. </p> <p>The priesthood was always anticipated, and graduation was followed by two years at Westcott House theological college, Cambridge. But thoughts of a comfortable rural parish were cast aside following a chance invitation to visit the Charterhouse Public School Mission in the backstreets of Bermondsey, South London. The conditions in the area and the lack of opportunities for its youngsters opened his eyes. </p> <p>From 1944-58 he was assistant missioner at Charterhouse, and then warden of the Wellington College Mission in East Lane, Walworth. These were pastoral roles with an emphasis on running youth clubs and taking children out to the greener suburbs to practise sport, and to camp in the grounds of Charterhouse and Wellington schools, and to the Isle of Wight - often their first glimpse of real countryside and the sea. </p> <p>In 1958, Hinds moved round the corner as rector of St Peter's, Walworth. There he immersed himself in the local community, opening up the crypt as a social centre for local families. His insistence that local children should have local facilities led to the creation of the massive Burgess Park in Walworth, which he was asked to open in 1982. </p> <p>Hinds' expertise in youth and educational issues led to membership of the team responsible for the Newsom Report - Half our Future - of 1963, on educational provision for 13 to 16-year-olds. Finding a natural home in the Labour party, Hinds's political life began with election to Southwark Council in 1960 and to the Greater London Council in 1967. It ended with the abolition of the GLC in 1986. He was chairman of Southwark's children's committee and of the London youth committee. </p> <p>He was vice-chairman (1967-70) and then chairman (1970-77) of the schools committee of the Inner London Education Authority, a key player in the controversial reorganisation of secondary schools along comprehensive lines and in the devolution of some local budgetary control to schools, years ahead of the Thatcher government's proposals. </p> <p>Though Hinds became an honorary canon of Southwark Cathedral in 1969, his political activities and achievements had confirmed his frustration with the church's inability and lack of desire to change social conditions, so he left it in 1972 to become chief executive of the London Union of Youth Clubs, which supported leaders in over 700 clubs. </p> <p>The wide-ranging umbrella of the GLC also allowed Hinds to pursue other interests. It brought membership of the South Bank Theatre board (overseeing the birth of the National Theatre), the board of London Festival Ballet and the Port of London Authority. Hinds' year as ceremonial chairman of the GLC, 1983-84, saw the staid reception rooms and the wonderful riverside terrace of County Hall opened up to all Londoners, rather than just the \"great and the good\". </p> <p>Abolition of the GLC in 1986 allowed a total life change and retirement to the Hertfordshire village of Tewin, where Hinds was a familiar figure with William, his beloved Airedale dog. There, he created a magnificent cottage garden. </p> <p>Married twice, he is survived by his second wife Lin, and by Anna and Jeremy from his first marriage. </p> <p>Harvey William Hinds, politician, clergyman and youth campaigner, born August 29 1920; died September 1 2000</p>",
  "If the opinion polls are correct and the elections fair, Slobodan Milosevic has less than a month left as Yugoslavia's president - and the candidate tipped to beat him is a rare animal among the Serbian elite, a man who never joined the Communist party or accepted favours from the present regime. <p>This unusual record in a centralised country where careers rarely advance without loyalty to the ruling party belongs to Vojislav Kostunica, leader of the Democratic party of Serbia. The latest figures from the Centre for the Research of Alternatives put him at 52%, against Mr Milosevic's 26%. Two other recent polls gave him a lead of more than 20%. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica's success is all the more extraordinary, given that he is a low-key professor of constitutional law who admits that he has none of the fashionable requirements of modern electioneering. \"I am not a presumptuous man and I do not think that I am charismatic at all. I am not a populist either\", he told a press conference in Belgrade this week, according to the text his party put out on its website (<a href=\"http://www.dss.org.yu\" target=\"_NEW\">www.dss.org.yu</a>).</p> <p>His attraction may be that he is the exact opposite of Mr Milosevic in character. He prides himself on being approachable and trustworthy. His campaign posters say: \"Who can look you straight in the eye? Kostunica\". </p> <p>He is also helped by rare unity among Serbia's many opposition parties which back him. Only the Serbian Renewal Movement led by the maverick Vuk Draskovic has put up its own candidate. </p> <p>The elections were called by Mr Milosevic a year early, after he rushed through constitutional amendments calling for the president to be elected by direct popular vote instead of by the parliament. This would allow him to run for two new four-year terms. He hoped to wrongfoot the the opposition, but the polls suggest he may have miscalculated. </p> <p>The opposition and most independent analysts assume that there will be poll fraud, unless Mr Kostunica is ahead by a huge margin. </p> <p>The opposition candidate traces his ancestry to a hamlet called Kostunici in central Serbia. This region, known as Sumadiya, where two uprisings against the Ottoman empire began, is the heart of historic Serbian nationalism. </p> <p>On the stump he appeals to nationalist pride, evoking local heroes who fought against Serbia's occupiers. In Zajecar, on the eastern border with Bulgaria, he told a crowd: \"Everyone in Serbia has some heroic blood. We will show how worthy we are of our ancestors on September 24.\" </p> <p>Aged 56, he is a lifelong anti-communist, a moderate Serb nationalist and an economic liberal. He was among Belgrade University staff who were sacked in 1974 for opposing constitutional changes which gave Yugoslavia's republics and Kosovo substantial autonomy. </p> <p>After Tito's death he co-authored the first book which was allowed to be published advocating a multi-party system. Six years later he refused to take his job back at the university when Serbia's new leader, Mr Milosevic, offered it. </p> <p>Instead, Mr Kostunica took up the political fight against Mr Milosevic and joined other friends in forming the Democratic party. They were elected to the federal parliament. Three years later the party split over whether to co-operate with Mr Milosevic, and Mr Kostunica took the radicals with him to form the Democratic party of Serbia. </p> <p>Although a strong supporter of the rights of Serb minorities during Yugoslavia's dissolution, he was never involved in paramilitary activities. </p> <p>\"In parliament he was one of the best speakers. He's honest and keeps his word. He does not seem obsessed by power, as most Serb politicians are,\" a senior journalist said. </p> <p>One of his main promises is to change the Serbian constitution towards a parliamentary system. He then says he will resign after 18 months and hold new elections. </p> <p>In foreign policy he is trying to steer a line between strong criticism of Nato and opening Serbia towards integration with Europe. He denounces western sanctions and welcomes French hints that they may be lifted after the poll. </p> <p>He wants closer ties with the Serb-run entity in Bosnia. His attitude to Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro, is ambiguous. While he says he would accept an independent Montenegro, he has irritated its government by accusing it of being afraid of democracy in boycotting the elections. </p> <p>In Kosovo he has close links with the Serb leaders in northern Mitrovice, who want to turn their part of the city into an enclave. He sneers at the US administration for relying on Mr Milosevic as a guarantor of peace in Bosnia and then denouncing him as a war criminal. He jeers at Mr Milosevic for pretending he won in Kosovo when his policy ended in \"capitulation\". </p> <p>Denied access to the state television and radio, Mr Kostunica has campaigned in small towns. \"Most people can hardly make ends meet. They are humiliated and tormented,\" he said. \"Now they have raised their heads.\" </p> <p>His big problem is whether Mr Milosevic will let him win. Mr Kostunica puts the issue in apocalyptic terms: \"These are not normal elections. It is a matter of life and death.\" </p> <p><b>What their papers say</b></p> <p>\"We have to win against Nato. We need people of granite to be our president, as President Milosevic is - hero of the country's defence and the man who launched renewal and rebuilding\" </p> <p><b> Borba [Struggle] - federal government newspaper</b> </p> <p>\"Our proven enemies, Nato and the opposition, are working together. Their goal is further destabilisation of the country, economic torture and fragmentation,\" said Veselin Stanojevic, JUL board member, in the village of Vojnik </p> <p><b> Vecerni Novosti [Our Newspaper] - federal government controlled</b> </p> <p>\"While every honourable citizen was happy for every bridge, road and house that has been rebuilt, the opposition Nato parties compete in convincing our citizens that rebuilding and progress are just illusion and tricks,\" said Mirko Marijanovic, vice-president of Serbia </p> <p><b> Politika [Politics] - main state organ</b> </p> <p>Massive support for beloved leaders is more important for [the Milosevic regime] than the individual thoughts of citizens hidden by the curtain at the poll booth </p> <p><b> Danas [Today] - Non-government newspaper</b></p>",
  "Six years ago, I learned that my husband was having an affair with a woman 30 years his junior - one of a series of long-standing relationships with leading ladies in his amateur theatre group. After counselling, I decided to stay with him and asked him to leave the theatre, which he did. Redundancy led to his retirement at 55. I continued to teach full time. <p>Since then, he has done nothing more than attend a 20-week recreational course in philosophy, deal with the supermarket shopping and cut the grass. I've suggested voluntary work, study, part-time work and travel, but he spends his time in bed and reading. He is bored, and thoroughly bad-tempered, partly because of a sleep deficit resulting from the early stages of prostate cancer diagnosed three years ago, and partly because my work prevents my being lively company to divert him. He claims leaving the theatre has \"fettered his mind\" and left him incapable of wanting to do anything but return and play King Lear. Is this really the only future? How can I accept calmly his return to temptation? </p> <p><b> Time to stop nagging</b><br> </p> <p>Don't you think it's time you took the blinkers off? As a former teacher myself, I know how narrow and small-minded teachers can be. The theatre offers all the fun, colour and excitement that you do not. You have laid the law down and made him leave it, offering in exchange educational courses and voluntary work. Ageing and ill as he is, and probably afraid that he might not have much longer, he probably doesn't see much point in those activities. There's no wonder he's depressed. </p> <p>He has made an effort to accede to your wishes. He obviously regrets it and is not behaving very well, but he is waiting for you to do your part. The first thing you should do is stop nagging and start asking. Why does he need all these affairs? And why only the leading ladies? Is he even telling the truth? Having counselling for just yourself is hardly going to help you as a couple. </p> <p>As to future temptation (and at 61, with all the physical effects of prostate cancer, it is increasingly unlikely) why not encourage him to return to the theatre, and go with him? Amateur companies always need behind-the-scenes workers - prompters, stage managers, props, wardrobe, scenery painters, committee members etc - which call for the organisational skills that all teachers possess. You might even discover that you enjoy it, too, which will create a new bond, and keep all those voracious leading ladies at bay. <br><b>Clare Girvan</b><br>Exeter </p> <p> <b> Go your separate ways</b><br> </p> <p>What a miserable existence your husband must be leading! And really, what a mean-minded, self-centred person you come over as! I found your letter one of the worst advertisements for conventional marriage I've encountered in a long time. </p> <p>Significantly, you never once indicate that you actually love your husband. Why, therefore, do you want this charade of a relationship to continue? For that matter, why does he? Perhaps he has become more dependent because of his illness; perhaps he always was a dependent sort of man. </p> <p>My recommendation to you both would be: free yourselves up. Get out from under one another's feet. Any meaningful relationship between you is probably over because love has gone out of it. Sticking together the way you are now isn't going to help either of you. At the very least you could bear in mind some of the things that were said in last week's Private Lives about the possibilities of a \"platonic marriage\", or another form of relationship. <br><b>R M Love</b><br>Glasgow </p> <p><b> Get yourself a toy boy</b><br> </p> <p>How old did you say he was? Thirteen and a half? Have you contacted the Guinness Book of Records about this marathon sulk? Buy the silly old goat a bottle of Grecian 2000, send him back to his play-acting and carry on with your life. You'll hardly notice any difference. </p> <p>For your recreation, may I recommend the acquisition of a toy boy? They are widely available, decorative and amusing, not to mention useful around the house, disposable and easily replaceable.

How absurd to make a loved one stop what they love to do. If she really thinks he does not still \"play\" on the side, then she is a fool. You cannot lock someone up and expect them to be happy. If love and trust were ever present at all in the relationship, there would be no need to ask another to be miserable. <br><a href=\"mailto:MysterysVixyn@aol.com\">MysterysVixyn@aol.com</a></p> <p><b>Next week</b></p> <p>I'm a 13 year-old girl who attends a single-sex grammar school.

  "Turkey's tourism minister apologised yesterday after hundreds of gay tourists were prevented by local police from entering the coastal town of Kusadasi and the nearby Roman ruins at Ephesus. <p>\"I hope they will complete their trip without any problems,\" the minister, Erkan Mumcu, said. \"We cannot discriminate according to people's sexual preference.\"</p> <p>The group of 833 gay men, including a number of Britons, arrived in Turkey on Wednesday on the cruise liner Olympic Voyager on its way from Israel.</p> <p>Several bus loads of men on their way to the spectacular ruins at Ephesus were turned back by the police. Others were prevented from entering the town of Kusadasi to go shopping.</p> <p>\"When we got back, a guy from the ship just said: 'Get on the ship as fast as you can,' \" Ken Damon from Tucson, Arizona said. \"We were going to spend two weeks in Kusadasi, but we don't want to be in a country that doesn't respect us.\"</p> <p>Local people, including the mayor, were also quick to apologise. \"This is against human rights,\" Haci Kahveci, a local tradesman said. \"If it happens again we'll take action. It shouldn't be tolerated.\"</p> <p>Most of the gay tourists were from the United States. The US embassy contacted Turkish authorities to demand that the Americans be allowed to travel freely. By then, however, the damage had been done.</p> <p>One of the organisers of the tour, Jonathan Evrin, said they had visited Turkey last year without encountering any problems, and he was at a loss to explain the sudden change in attitude.</p> <p>Homosexuality is not technically illegal in Turkey, but officials said yesterday that there was a clause in the passport law which could allow the authorities to prevent gays entering the country. The local gay community complains of constant discrimination, even though many gay singers are very popular.</p> <p>Yesterday the tourists moved on to Istanbul, where they were shadowed by a heavy police presence. Riot police and motorcycle outriders accompanied the tourist buses as they visited some of the city's best known sites.</p> <p>The interior minister had issued a personal guarantee that the tourists would be safe, but there are red faces in the bureaucracy over an incident which has not done much for Turkey's image as a hospitable tourist destination.</p>",
  "Anarchic hand syndrome is so grotesque it verges on the comic, and is one of neurology's most puzzling phenomena, according to Sergio Della Salla, a consultant at the University of Aberdeen. <p>He told the British Association that some cases of brain damage resulted in a hand doing the opposite of what its owner intended.</p> <p>\"One of our patients once, at dinner, much to her dismay saw her left hand taking fish bones from leftovers and putting them into her mouth,\" he said. \"Another complained her hand did what it wanted, and she tried to control its drifting by hitting it or talking to it in anger and frustration.\"</p> <p>The syndrome was demonstrated by Peter Sellers in the film Dr Strangelove, when he grabbed his arm to prevent a Nazi salute.</p> <p>Another researcher reported that an anarchic hand patient had problems in choosing TV channels because, as soon as the right hand selected one station, the left hand would press another button. Patients with the condition behaved as if they two streams of consciousness. Prof Della Salla said such symptoms \"should make us think about our concepts of agency, and free will\".</p>",
  "One might argue that angels and mobile phones have much in common, delivering messages from another world that are frequently disturbing, incomprehensible or abruptly terminated. <p>One of England's most prominent angels, the 15ft golden weather vane that soars over Guildford cathedral high on its hill above the Surrey town, will soon serve both God and mammon, rising towards heaven on a One-to-One radio mast. </p> <p>When the angel is replaced on Monday, having been regilded with real gold leaf at a cost of \u00a320,000 paid for by the phone company, the pillar on which the vane rotates will appear unchanged, but will be a new steel structure concealing a base station and masts. </p> <p>Phone companies have long seen churches as a heaven-sent solution to their problems, and have often been welcomed with open arms by parishes at their wits' end to meet maintenance bills. </p> <p>The companies have fought bruising battles with residents over siting base stations and masts, exacerbated by the unresolved scientific debate over possible long term health implications of the radio waves. There are believed to be more than 20,000 masts in Britain, and an estimated 100,000 more will be needed over the decade. </p> <p>Against this background, thousands of churches, typically sited on the highest point of the surrounding land scape, isolated and with tall towers, appear a godsend. </p> <p>Although the practice has made conservation groups and some worshippers uneasy, it is blessed by John Prescott's environment department, and the Anglican and Catholic church authorities have each said that any decision rests with individual churches. </p> <p>Hundreds carry some mobile phone equipment, often disguised as flagpoles or lightning conductors. In return the churches get a rent, \u00a33,000 to \u00a330,000 a year, depending on the equipment, and often get help with restoration work when it is installed. </p> <p>The 12th century St Mary Redcliffe in Bristol has Vodaphone masts and cables concealed in the 292ft spire that Elizabeth I called \"the fairest in England\". St Mary's vicar, Rev Tony Whatmough, said cheerfully: \"The church has always been involved in the business of communication.\" </p> <p>However, the Churches Conservation Trust said it believed any approaches should be very carefully considered, both for aesthetic and potential long term safety reasons. </p> <p>The Grade II* listed Guildford cathedral was designed by Sir Edward Maulf in 1936 but not completed until the 1960s, when the angel, designed by a local metalworker, William Pickford, was added. </p> <p>Cathedral administrator Bill Evershed called the deal \"a win win\" situation for the cathedral and for One-to-One, which needed to update equipment sited on the roof since 1993. There had been no objections, he said.</p>",
  "Using an 18th-century American law designed to combat piracy on the high seas, the people of Bougainville island in Papua New Guinea have filed a damages claim in California against Rio Tinto, the Anglo-Australian mining giant based in London. <p>The suit, alleging that years of copper mining by the company harmed the environmental and human rights on the island, was filed on Wednesday at a San Francisco federal court under the Alien Tort Claims Act 1789. It allows foreign nationals to sue American companies for alleged human rights violations committed abroad. </p> <p>Rio Tinto said: \"We categorically reject the claims. They have no merit whatsoever.\" A hearing has yet to be fixed to see if the US court will accept jurisdiction. The claimants' lawyers are hoping the court will agree on the basis that Rio Tinto has extensive mining interests in the US, including California. </p> <p>The company, the third largest mining conglomerate in the world, owns, through a subsidiary, 53% of the huge Panguna copper mine - a hole in the forest 3.7 miles long, 2.5 miles wide and a third of a mile deep. </p> <p>It was opened in 1972 but shut in 1989 when complaints about environmental damage grew into armed conflict over the island's mineral wealth between the government of Papua New Guinea and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. An eight-year guerrilla war ensued. </p> <p>The legal claim, filed by a Seattle lawyer, Steve Berman, alleges that the company brought financial influence to bear on Papua New Guinea's government, which is accused by the plaintiffs of killing 15,000 islanders through aerial bombing, village-burning and other acts of destruction. </p> <p>It says that the company razed forests, polluted rivers, retarded crop growth and caused birth defects. The island has a population of about 170,000. </p> <p>Mr Berman said: \"We intend to prove that Rio Tinto treated Bourgainvilleans with no respect and thought of them as inferior in every way: socially, economically, racially and politically.\" </p> <p>The Alien Tort Claims Act was passed in 1789 to allow victims of theft by pirates at sea to sue onshore. Since 1980 there have been cases where federal courts have ruled that individuals and companies can stand trial in the US for crimes abroad, even if the plaintiffs are foreigners. </p> <p>The first case against a company was two years ago when a Los Angeles judge ruled that the US oil company Unocal could stand trial for human rights abuses committed by the authorities in Burma on behalf of Unocal. In April another California judge ruled that another oil company, Chevron, could be tried in the US for abuses committed by Nigerian police against people living in the delta area where the oil is pumped. </p> <p>Three years ago the Panguna mine achieved international notoriety when Papua New Guinea brought in a private British military company, Sandline, to quell the rebellion using mercenaries from South Africa. </p> <p>The resulting scandal and a backlash by elements of Papua New Guinea's military led to Sandline being told to leave the country and the government falling. </p> <p>The successor government agreed yesterday - after two years of peace talks with Bougainville representatives - to consider a proposal for a referendum on Bougainville's status which could include questions on autonomy or independence.</p>",
  "<p>Alex Cox is an anarchic director. He made his first movie, the punk classic Repo Man, on Hollywood money, then did his best to get as far away from Tinseltown as possible.</p> <p>\"The film director's career is designed to take you to Hollywood - Alan Parker is a good example. He started on commercials, then he made films that glorify the FBI,\" says Cox, referring to his fellow compatriot's film Mississippi Burning. \"Now he's head of the Film Council.\" </p> <p>Cox's career has taken a different path. Between occasional acting jobs and presenting the BBC's Moviedrome, he has made the junkie saga Sid and Nancy, the spaghetti western homage Straight to Hell, the Nicaraguan odyssey Walker, and the Spanish-language police-corruption drama, Highway Patrolman. \"After Sid and Nancy, I kept getting junkie scripts, which was the last thing I wanted to do.\" </p> <p>Cox's tastes are as catholic as his creations. At his Liverpool base, he keeps the videos that continue to inspire him. At the top of the heap are 20 by the great surrealist Luis Bunuel. \"He's the man. I don't think he ever made a bad film, and most directors do. I like his Mexican films best, in particular The Exterminating Angel, which is his first satire of the bourgeoisie. But Bunuel was really a bourgeois himself, for all that he was an anarchist; he was unfaithful to his wife, he was a wine connoisseur and a gourmand. He was just like Fernando Rey, who always plays the character in his films that is satirised the most.\" </p> <p>Cox has recently made a documentary on another of his heroes, Kurosawa. \"He was cantankerous, exigent, a difficult person. I'm very impressed by his last film, Madadayo, which is critical of Japanese society and of his own status within it - as an old man revered by a bunch of fools - very like King Lear, and therefore Ran [Kurosawa's film of Lear]. It's about the fallibility of old age, and of the false nature of the great man, and Kurosawa was that great man.\" </p> <p>How direct an influence do these cherished films have? \"You just steal from them. We stole the structure of Kiss Me Deadly for Repo Man. Before that it was just an anecdotal tale of LA punks and a car repossession firm.\" Straight to Hell was a tribute to another film in his collection, Django Kill. \"After the success of Django, there were all kinds of spin-offs, and this is a particularly obscure, violent and perverse one which you would only know about if you were a spaghetti western fanatic. I have two versions of it.\" </p> <p>Cox also has the original Django, another obscurity called Tepepa, which features Orson Welles as a Mexican general, and three versions of Big Silence, a slice of Italian nastiness by Sergio Corbucci, director of the original Django. \"It's the only film I know where the bad guys win. Films like this killed the American westerns - Peckinpah politicised the genre, and spaghetti westerns turned it inside out. They were dances of death.\" </p> <p>Moviedrome detritus also fills the shelf space: Tarkovsky's Solaris, Godard's Alphaville, Mike Hodges' Get Carter, along with the work of German pioneers Fassbinder and Herzog - although Cox's admiration really lies with Herzog's old leading man Klaus Kinski, demonised by his former friend in a documentary. \"As a director, you're complicit in what happens to your cast, yet he makes out that it was Kinski who was impossible and not him. What he doesn't appreciate is how loyal Kinski was to him. Many actors betray their talent for money, and Kinski never did that.\" </p> <p>If the films in Cox's collection have anything in common, it is that they all possess a certain defiance, and you get the impression that he is unforgiving on those who fall short of this. One of his favourite films is Lindsay Anderson's O Lucky Man. \"Anderson came from a patrician background, yet he was a standard-bearer for breaking down its conventions. But I lost respect for him after he made a TV film called The Old Crowd. The critics hated it, and up until then he had been their golden boy. He lost his confidence, went on to make absolute rubbish and just became a wimp. These rich kids can't take a licking.\" Has Cox ever had a licking? \"Oh, now and then.\" </p> <p>Cox also keeps a selection of little-known Russian and Mexican favourites close at hand, and King Kong and Citizen Kane, but few modern Hollywood movies. He can recognise a fellow dissident spirit, however. \"I admire Paul Verhoeven. He's making these giant special effects films, but he's managed to maintain his own sense of perversity. Starship Troopers has teenage heroes who are Nazis - didn't the studio heads realise? </p> <p>\"But even he had a price to pay. He was on our Kurosawa documentary and a Dutch guy saw it and said, 'That's not Verhoeven. Those aren't his teeth.' He has to deal with studio execs and actors the whole time, and you've got to have perfect teeth to do that. The question is, is it worth it?\" Cox's teeth, by the way, are all over the place.</p>",
  "<p>Say hello to the brilliant young man, the great hope of modern Hollywood. And the first thing you notice is the absence; what he doesn't walk in with. Because however you define star quality - the glint of an eye, the ease of a smile - Edward Norton doesn't have it. If you're searching for a movie idol, you're in the wrong place. With his black jeans and Gap T-shirt, he looks just like what he is: an intelligent, educated American of a certain age and background. </p> <p>Handshake, small talk about his jet lag. Nothing special. But take a look at that CV: it's immaculate. A breakthrough from nowhere in the 1996 thriller Primal Fear, followed by triumph after triumph after triumph. No wrong moves, just critical sweet talk every time he steps onscreen, supported by the patronage of directors as diverse as Woody Allen and Milos Forman, John Dahl and David Fincher. A list to which, two weeks after his 31st birthday, his own name can now be added with the romantic comedy Keeping the Faith, wherein he appears both behind and in front of the camera. </p> <p>We should have seen it coming. Ascension always came naturally for Norton, the eldest son of a teacher and an attorney, brought up in Columbia, Maryland, a planned community designed by his architect grandfather, James Rouse. He attended Yale, majoring in history between theatre productions and Japanese classes. Even now, there's something unshakably Ivy League about him: a hesitant laugh, a pensive articulacy. </p> <p>But don't think you can pin him down that quickly, the rich boy with the good life. After working in Osaka for his grandfather's Enterprise Foundation (\"designed to create decent housing for low-income families\"), he spent five years in New York, in dead-end jobs, appearing off-Broadway, losing out in auditions. He wasn't brilliant. Not yet. He only turned brilliant with Primal Fear. When Leonardo DiCaprio - remember him? - exited the project, he screen-tested for the pivotal role of an altar boy with a venomously split personality. Norton gently stuttered through a peach of an Appalachian accent. The gig was his; he stole the film. </p> <p>Afterwards, with scripts his for the taking, he cherry-picked: an east coast fop in Allen's Everyone Says I Love You, an eager lawyer in Forman's The People Vs Larry Flynt, a Bacchanalian gambler in Dahl's Rounders, a brutal neo-Nazi in the flawed but fascinating American History X. Then came Fincher's Fight Club, in which he flaunted his bruises with corporate fascism and Swedish furniture. It was quite some performance, in quite some film. He was the new Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro rolled into one: the leading man du jour, a face fit for magazine covers. </p> <p>Not that he likes that part of the deal. Sure, he enjoys discussing the mechanics of his trade. Ask him about The Score, his next project, in which he stars opposite both De Niro and Marlon Brando, and he shakes his head in excitement: \"God, when I was watching those two guys, those two great, gestural, non-verbal guys, I realised I was just staring at them - they could have been reciting the phone book.\" Mention Method acting and there's a 10- minute discourse: \"In terms of using your sense memory, that's something I've never agreed with. I was discussing it with Bob on-set...\" Talk shop with Edward Norton, and you get the same fierce, focused engagement you assume he had when, at eight, he turned to his teacher while rehearsing Annie Get Your Gun and enquired: \"What's my objective here?\" </p> <p>It's the fluff that's the problem. Forget, his rumoured relationships (rumoured because he refuses to discuss them) with Courtney Love, Drew Barrymore and, lately, Salma Hayek. For Norton, the dispassionate demeanour and the average-Joe garb aren't accidental, as much as pathological. \"I've kind of reached a point,\" he says, \"where I can manage the media process. But I rarely find that anything of value results from it. I mean, I recognise it's regarded as necessary by the commercial engine behind the films, so I'm happy to talk about the film in question and the field I'm in, without having to talk about me per se. I just think there are higher-minded conversations to be had than talking about my fairly humdrum daily life.\" </p> <p>Only there's something else to his reserve, a longstanding conviction that blank canvases make the best actors (\"the more you load people up on your own life, the more disbelief they have to suspend\") and a repulsion at the idea of selling himself to the media. The rest of us may be amusing ourselves to death but, to Norton, the entire celebrity circus needs moving on. He looks as angry as he gets when I ask why the films themselves are never enough. \"The thing is, whether you're an intelligent journalist or an intelligent actor, there's this consistent pressure to deliver for the broadest common denominator, and an assumption of a lack of sophistication on the part of the audience. And I think that's wrong. I really do. I think that's fundamentally wrong. And I actually think it's in the best interests of democracy not to just blithely accept it.\" </p> <p>He'll stash his anonymity for Keeping the Faith. And, at least in the US, the reward has been yet more garlands; even if, this time round, the plaudits are exaggerated. Because, while Norton's directorial debut is far from shoddy, it is deeply, weirdly anachronistic: a screwball New York menage a trois concerning a priest (played by Norton), his rabbinical best friend, and the girl both are pining for. It's laden with peppy one-liners and incessant group hugs. </p> <p>The result is not dissimilar to a two-hour episode of Friends. Which is a strange enough place to see Edward Norton appearing, let alone find him starting his career as a film-maker. \"Oh yeah, I see that. But it wasn't done out of any conscious desire to have people say, 'Oh, how different for him.' I mean, I'd written the film with Stuart [Blumberg, a friend from Yale], I was producing it, the window came up and I started to think what was the point in giving this to someone else so we could sit around wondering if they would get the jokes? And I even called Fincher and Milos and said, 'Listen, is there any downside to this not being the kind of film I would have expected to do?' And they both said absolutely, categorically no. Just take the chance.\" </p> <p>Still, it takes some swallowing that, after the racist thugs and pugilistic salarymen, Keeping the Faith just happened to be so frothy; that a man whose first movie centred on a Catholic priest sexually abusing his choristers is now casting himself as a minister whose only foible appears to be his incompetence at basketball. \"Well, I love those kinds of movies. I loved The Philadelphia Story and Jules et Jim, those complicated, relationship-based comic dramas. And, besides it being fun, there was a substantive foundation. I mean, if you strip away the fact it's about a rabbi and a priest, what you have is three people wrestling with turning 30, which I was at the time, where certain assumptions you had about yourself just don't seem to work any more.' </p> <p>But, even in a film like Keeping the Faith, there's an undercurrent: the same undercurrent that marked out Derek, anti-hero of American History X, and the anarchist narrator of Fight Club, and now ripples through Father Brian, the kindly cleric. It's the need for something to believe in, for something real. And if Faith and Fight Club have anything in common, it's that same hostility to the hip, the knowing, and the ironic: the desire for authenticity, whether via God or an Ikea-baiting revolution. So, is this what's pulling Edward Norton's strings? </p> <p>\"Yeah. And actually, in Larry Flynt as well. Hmmm. I mean, I personally have never really connected with that vision of our generation as this aimless, angst-ridden mass, that's one of the reasons I liked Fight Club - because it was about something I believe, that our generation's disease is not aimless angst, but a real despair. It's like what Radiohead are getting at on OK Computer, that feeling of being truly oppressed by modernity, and having a desperate need to reconnect with an authentic self. And, yeah, one of the things I like about Keeping the Faith is that these characters are searching for that same authenticity.\" </p> <p> All of which, with Hollywood busy grooming him as a hybrid of Jimmy Stewart's everyman and Orson Welles's precocious genius, raises a question: namely, once you've got the world's attention, what do you do with it? What does the man who could be anything do with his time? Do a De Niro and keep hacking out the character roles? Use that actorly gravitas and follow the lead of Warren Beatty, who once called him out of the blue to offer him career advice, and flirt with political power beyond the confines of Beverly Hills? Or maybe just try to make better, more honest films? </p> <p>\"Well,\" he says, \"I get a little tired of irony being the only way of looking at the world, and of deflecting our vulnerability with glib denials. I don't think that's anything like what our generation is really about. And yeah, in both Keeping the Faith and Fight Club, you've got these characters who are opening their arms and getting ready to be whacked, whether that's through loving another person, or being seduced by nihilism. And if people come to equate me with that kind of openness, then I take that as a compliment.\" </p> <p>And what if - or when - the lustre comes off in his hands, if, after the promotional dust settles, people aren't shocked at the bold departure of Keeping the Faith as much as disappointed by it. What happens to a brilliant young man when he falls on his face? \"Oh, I'm prepared for that. Sure. I mean, in the industry town where I have to work, a lot of people regard Fight Club as a failure, simply because it lost money, which to me is ridiculous. But, yeah, at some point something I'm working on won't come as close to what I wanted as the films I've done so far. It's too potentially disastrous a process for that. I mean, there are great Beatles songs, and there are lesser Beatles songs...\" </p> <p>He spins around, makes sure to catch my eye. \"Not that I'm comparing myself to the Beatles. But yes, I'd rather take the chance and work on something which is on some level a discussion of how we're living, and where we should be going. And if that doesn't come off, which one day it won't, then fine. You know? At least I took the chance.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Keeping the Faith is released on September 15.</p>",
  "<p>There is currently a clutch of Hollywood directors who share a similar reputation for big-budget, star-studded and visually extravagant movies. They also share something slightly more improbable: a background in 30-second adverts for sports shoes. </p> <p>Next week sees the release of The Cell, the first feature film to be directed by prince among ad directors, Tarsem Singh. He is the latest to have joined the prestigious alumni of Nike commercials directors who have successfully transferred their skills to a feature length format. </p> <p>For company, he has the likes of David Fincher, Spike Jonze and Dominic Sena and he will soon be joined by Anthony Hoffman, director of the forthcoming Val Kilmer movie, Red Planet. Can it be mere coincidence that the Nike campaign has for over a decade been breeding Hollywood directors at such an impressive rate? Perhaps. After all, a company with such a glamorous brand and big budget is likely to recruit the world's hottest ad directors - and these ad directors invariably end up dabbling in features anyway. (Alan Parker, Adrian Lyne and the brothers Scott proved this point long ago). </p> <p>The advertising agency who create the ads and hire the directors would beg to differ. \"We've always gone for the directors who will take our ideas and run with them, regardless of whether they're big names or not,\" says Wieden and Kennedy producer Henry Lu, who works on the Nike campaign. It appears that when inexperienced directors walk into Wieden and Kennedy for meetings with Nike executives, they come out again ready to shoot multi-million dollar movies for Hollywood's biggest studios. So what's their secret?</p> <p> Certainly, it's an ad agency with a reputation for an absurdly creative atmosphere - complete with an in-house basketball court and games of hockey in the corridors. Tarsem is keenly aware of the advantages of working for such a company: \"Nike always come to you with a more open brief,\" he says. \"They don't give you a storyboard and tell you to make an ad in the way their executives have already decided. Instead, they seek out directors that they think will bring their own ideas along. They're not interested in giving you a present that you just have to put on film. I wouldn't say they train you to be a feature film director, it's just that they happen to look for the same sort of people that Hollywood look for. </p> <p>\"They want their directors to be able to work with constantly-shifting goal posts and ideas that evolve continually throughout the shoot. And because their ads very often involve superstars, they want directors who are going to be able to deal with them. These are things that aren't necessary with all ads but are necessary when you're making a feature film.\" </p> <p>Tarsem had also spent years displaying an abundance of craft via his work for Nike. In 1994's Good Versus Evil ad, he created a visual spectacular while simultaneously conveying a compelling storyline whereby the Devil was destroyed by Eric Cantona. He is keen to play down the significance of his narrative skills, how ever. \"The advertising trend, particularly with Nike, is for aggressive, explosive visuals,\" he says. \"That's also a very popular look in Hollywood and so they will ask me to do that sort of a film. No one in Hollywood is going to look at my Nike ads and think: 'This guy would be perfect for a film that's dialogue-driven.' They're going to think I'd be good for a very visually dramatic film. In fact, if they hired me on the basis of my ads then asked me to do something where the narrative was driven by dialogue I'd be shocked.\"</p> <p> There is more to winning the attentions of Hollywood producers than a few spectacular shots. Nike's advertising agency are particularly proud of their endeavours to tell universal tales. \"For better or for worse, we've always tried to concentrate on the entertainment rather than the advertising,\" says Henry Lu. \"And Nike are more lenient with us in that sense. If we'd taken the idea for Good vs Evil to other clients, they would have said: 'Yeah right! When do we get to see the shoes?' But Nike just loved it and let us get on with it.\" </p> <p>Nike's size helps. You could show a Hollywood producer the greatest 30-second ad ever created but if it turned out to be promoting the virtues of, say, Winalot, they wouldn't be convinced. Hollywood studios doubtlessly feel more comfortable handing a multi-million dollar project over to someone who has already been trusted with the brand image of a company like Nike. As one London advertising executive puts it: \"Having that swoosh appear on the closing frame of your commercial lends it certain credence.\" </p> <p>Anthony Hoffman directed Nike ads over the course of seven years before making Red Planet for Warner Bros this year. He is certain of the brand's cachet. \"No matter what other ads I had on my reel, the Hollywood executives always responded to Nike,\" he says.\"The guys in Hollywood are already aware that there are a lot of ad directors who can shoot the hell out of something,\" he says. \"But they also want to know if you can tell a story. Nike ads are fairly unique in that they will allow you to do both.\" </p> <p>In any case, films like The Cell and Dominic Sena's Gone in 60 Seconds have proved that Nike graduates are able to balance their penchant for the aesthetically lavish with a nod in the direction of storytelling. Similarly, Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich and David Fincher's Seven were enough to affirm the ability of directors from the Nike stable to make features with an intricate, overriding plot. Tarsem says that working on a movie makes you long to make an ad - just as being back in ads makes you long for another movie. He, along with Hoffman and Fincher, will get the chance to prove their worth when their brand new Nike ads are broadcast throughout the forthcoming Olympics. \"Directors love to shoot,\" he says. \"Hollywood is all about lunches and meetings. You've got to be shooting something in between and, as it happens, once you've made a movie you come back as a better ad director.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Cell is released on September 15.</p>",

There's not much sense of the 19th century about it, but its updating includes a neat role-reversal - here Tarzan has to teach Jane gorilla-speak. The fights and chases are dynamic and while there's none of the wit of A Bug's Life, there are a few nice jokes (\"It's way past your nest-time\") and spirited vocalising from the Brits in particular: Minnie Driver (a spirited Jane), Nigel Hawthorne and Brian Blessed. Disney's background depth is impressive as ever and there are only a few soggy moments. The DVD includes an hour of extras. </p> <p><strong> Double Jeopardy</strong><br> Rental Paramount Cert 15  <strong>** </strong><br> </p> <p> I got a bit tetchy about the plot holes early on, when Ashley Judd wakes up on a yacht covered in blood with her husband missing.

Once you accept that this bears the same relation to real life as rivets do to avocado pears, it's quite fun. If a team of warthogs with small moustaches had flown over my patio in perfect formation during the last half-hour, I'd barely have raised an eyebrow.</p>",
  "<p>Snatch, the second movie from Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels director Guy Ritchie, is straight in at number one in the pop culture charts and still no one seems concerned with whether it's any good. Instead we've been given a steady drip of the stuff that really matters. We know, for example, that on a photo shoot Ritchie and producer Matthew Vaughn got locked in a high-stakes poker game from which they couldn't be distracted. That Ritchie plucked some of the cast off the street (Andy the doorman from Bow, Addy the east end wheeler dealer); that Brad Pitt didn't use a stand-in for his bare-knuckle boxing scenes and that between takes the cast would play chess, gamble, and generally muck about at full \"Oi! On me 'ead\" volume, in their own brand of rhyming slang. </p> <p>We know that Ritchie used many of the same actors and crew as he did on Lock, Stock and that, when the big Hollywood finger comes out of the sky, those boys are going with him. Somehow the issue with Snatch is not whether Ritchie has pulled off another artful dodgy movie but whether he's still the geezer, the captain of macho mateyness, the self-styled king of camaraderie. You don't even need to have seen the film to know that it has achieved what it set out to, namely to create a bloke bonding session that makes Arsenal supporters look like a bunch of noncommittal ponces. </p> <p>What Ritchie and Vaughn have spotted is not (as their imitators imagined) a gap in the market for homegrown gangster movies, but a chance to exploit something at which the British male is still perceived to be a world leader - old fashioned camaraderie. Ritchie's milieu is a post-Krays fantasy, populated with Crombie-wearing diamond geezers who may be murderers, but they'd never let you down. It's about friends, male friends, the kind that Chris Evans and Gazza and Danny Baker longed to be. </p> <p>This is why Brad Pitt, who seems to be more than usually afflicted with the \"acting is a poof's job\" complex, asked to be in on whatever Ritchie did after Lock Stock: because it was a guaranteed mate-fest about mates, for mates and just being there, having a laugh over the pints and pickled eggs, and would do more for his cred than $10m. Pitt has been quoted saying that the cast blew him away: \"I was really taken with the camaraderie these guys have together.\" No mention of the genius of the director, the brilliance of the script, just bloody marvellous testosterone-tanked up mates. </p> <p>Coincidentally, Brad has just married Jennifer Aniston, who was made by the 90s pals comedy, Friends. Ritchie, further down the line, detected that all that fluffy, girly, H\u00e4agen-Dazs-sharing stuff has run its course (especially if you are male) and his partner, Madonna, was naturally first to go with the change in mood. One minute she was Miss Tricky, with Rupert Everett at her beck and call, the next she was \"the missus\", up the duff, having her cheeks chucked by Vinnie Jones and being dragged around in a Ritchie armlock, claiming to like nothing more than a pint of Guinness down the Windsor Castle. </p> <p>So it's a shame that Snatch turns out to be the visual equivalent of one of the entries in the Met officer's handbook to London's ethnic and religious minorities. Snatch is the intellectually challenged person's guide to a caricature of London gangland. Every line is delivered at duuuur speed, every bit of geezer dialogue laboured to allow you to memorise the jargon so when you nip round the corner for some pasta afterwards you can start calling the Irish waiter \"piker\", and each other \"mincey faggoty balls\". </p> <p>A bit of illegal boxing, dog fighting, hare coursing, a lot of shooting and sawing up of bodies, endless nothing queer about us jokes, some luverly slang and there you have it: the potted excellent adventure out east for morons. Since Lock, Stock you can't move down the dogs for would-be Vinnies from Kensington. Who knows what'll happen now. </p> <p>Well, for a start, guess who was in the cinema watching Snatch on Saturday night? Gwynie Paltrow and Ben Affleck (she was wearing cream cords and a jumper). Now you'd have thought that they could have arranged to see it without paying \u00a37 and enduring the scrum. But then that would have been to miss the whole point of the exercise, which is to soak up some of the old Brit camaraderie, the old Saturday night fancy-a-Snatch-and-a-sausage scene, and to feel like a real guy and his missus.</p>"
