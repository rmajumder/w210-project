  "<p>She's a modest figure in frosted white, her stage command at first expressed chiefly in her eloquent right wrist, with its signature trickle of bracelets. And it's quite a stage to command - not just the Arena audience (whose pashminas must have muffled 10% of the sound), but a miniature movie orchestra with strings and electric guitar; a dire background of projected fuchsia blobs resembling an Odeon foyer on a wet Wednesday; and a dance line-up-cum-backing group who writhe in daft get-ups like Maurice Binder's title credits for Bond films. </p> <p>But it doesn't matter. Asha-ji sings, the air thickens. She is 67, veteran of 12,000 soundtrack songs dubbed over whatever was Bollywood's desirable mouth of the moment. She can sing anything, any way - in a the-story-so-far chat session, she moves unaccompanied through decades and regions of style, gently teasing the jerks of phrasing of formal Indian performers. Later she sings one classical number for real, in a session with a trad dancer in which she provides a river of smooth-flowing mouth music for his fingers and feet. </p> <p>Her upper register conveys a permanent nubile 17, youthful not through silliness or squeakiness, but enthusiasm - in the dreamy intros of many of her songs you hear a young girl's voice across a misty river at dawn. In her lowest registers she can growl and croon along with Celia Cruz. She does a couple of show-stoppers from 30 years back as full-belt as Shirley Bassey, and an operetta-ish duet with male support so coy it could be Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy cooing to each other round a tree trunk, then responds to a younger male partner with vocal intelligence and a physical rapport expressed in minute checks and balances of movements across the stage. It's very sexy but never absurd: their brains are involved as well as their bodies. </p> <p>Apart from the occasional brow-mop, she makes it seem no effort at all. An ecstatic night. </p> <p> ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",
  "<p>When Debbie Wilkinson went for her interview at the British Boxing Board of Control, she had no idea she would be working for a sports organisation. \"The advert just said that an office in the London Bridge area was looking for an office junior,\" says Wilkinson, who three years later is secretary to Robert Smith, the board's assistant general secretary. \"When I arrived for the interview, I was a bit bewildered by all the boxing paraphernalia, but I was soon put straight.\" </p> <p>The BBBofC has been overseeing professional British boxing since 1929. During its early days, it was mostly concerned with the procedural side of the sport, such as the recognition of championships. In the last 20 to 30 years, however, its chief purpose has been to oversee the medical welfare of professional boxers. </p> <p>By happy coincidence, Wilkinson, 21, is a boxing fan. \"Although when I first started working here, I think Frank Bruno and Mike Tyson were the only boxers I could name. Now you could give me the name of almost any British boxer, and I will probably be able to tell you his weight, his manager and his fight record.\" </p> <p>She also enjoys going to watch matches whenever she can. \"I think you either love it or hate it,\" she says. \"Some of my friends think it's awful, but I find it really exciting. A lot of people don't realise the discipline and hard work that it takes to be a boxer.\" </p> <p>This is Wilkinson's first permanent job, although, appropriately enough, she always enjoyed sport at school and had completed a course in business in sport that she believes has come in very handy. \"It taught me some very useful organisational skills.\" </p> <p>She has a heavy typing load, because Smith is also the southern area secretary for the board. \"There is a lot of correspondence, but I've devised a system so that whenever possible there's already a standard letter, which saves a lot of work,\" she explains. \"Robert often writes reports on matches he's been to see and I really enjoy typing those up; they're extremely interesting and give me a great insight into the sport.\" </p> <p>Boxing is a demanding sport and no one, least of all the BBBofC, would deny that it can be extremely hazardous. All professional boxers must be licensed, and the rigorous rules which govern licensing are designed to ensure that the boxers are fully prepared, fit and well matched (ie, will be fighting someone with the equivalent level of expertise). One of Wilkinson's most time consuming tasks is issuing licences. \"I spend about three hours every day liaising with licence holders. It's not just boxers who need to be licensed but trainers, managers and referees.\" </p> <p>Licences are issued annually and are not given out lightly. The boxer must have a full medical examination by a board doctor, plus an eye test, a certificate of HIV testing and proof of hepatitis B vaccination. He or she must also undergo a brain scan and provide a skull x-ray report. </p> <p>\"Three weeks before a contest I will check whether or not the boxers concerned are due for a brain scan or a medical, or whether their licence fee is due,\" says Wilkinson. \"If anything needs to be done, I'll write and inform their managers. It's important that I do this well in advance, because although there are nine cen tres that do brain scans, they are scattered all over the country. For example, there's only one in London, so I must give them enough time to make sure they can get an appointment. I also look after the contracts between boxers and their managers - every boxer must be managed for his first year of turning professional.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson is responsible for the board's website. \"Someone came in to set it up and show me how to make changes to it. I put all our press statements on it, plus the circulars that go out once a month which state what fights are happening.\" </p> <p>Although boxing is an over whelmingly male dominated sport, there are now six women who are officially licensed to box - and more on the way - a number of female promoters and one female manager. \"When Jane Couch became the first professional woman boxer, the phone didn't stop ringing for two weeks. I tried to deal with as many of the calls as I could, otherwise Robert and Simon [Simon Block, general secretary of the BBBofC] would have been inundated,\" says Wilkinson. </p> <p>\"The best thing about this job is the people. I've yet to meet a boxer - one of the male ones that is - who wasn't a complete gentleman.\" </p> <p><strong> The inside track:</strong> A man's world? </p> <p> by Bill Saunders After a quarter of a century of equal opportunities, there are still men's jobs and women's jobs. Sometimes the reasons for the division are superficially obvious. Boxing is a case in point, firefighting another. Greater Manchester fire service recruited its first professional women firefighter only this year. </p> <p>But apart from the physical requirements - big firefighters can carry heavier people - there can be other, subtler influences. There is tradition: fire services prefer to recruit people with experience of the armed forces, because they are organised on military lines. And there is culture: well-meaning firefighters invited to treat a female colleague as one of the boys have done just that in the past. While it might be thought an amusing prank to forcibly dress an ex-guardsman in a skimpy nightdress and chain him to the station railings as an \"initiation ceremony\", the joke, such as it is, turns sour when the victim is a woman. </p> <p>But gender distinctions are not always so rough and ready. There is no physical reason why the vast majority of secretaries are women, but the fact remains that they are. It is such a glaring discrepancy that some try to deny it. Agencies will claim that things are changing, and that 15 to 20% of clerical jobs are done by men these days. Closer examination reveals, however, that this includes such positions as accounts clerk. When secretarial work only is taken into account, the percentage of men involved becomes so small that it barely registers. </p> <p>Another curiosity is that a couple of years ago, one secretarial agency discovered that male PAs tend to work for women managers. So perhaps when more women rise to the boardroom, the gender imbalance in office management will shift accordingly. </p> <p>It should be noted that in some fields - public relations is a good example - the rise of women in senior management has led to more secretaries being promoted, simply because those managers often began work as secretaries themselves.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes dance can invent a world just by putting unlikely combinations of people on the same stage. And they don't come much more unlikely than Christopher Bannerman, one-time principal of London Contemporary Dance Theatre and now professor of dance at Middlesex University, and Mavin Khoo, Malaysian-born virtuoso of South Asian dance. </p> <p>Bannerman, in his 50s, bears the marks of experience and intelligence on his face, while his body has the unassuming eloquence of one trained in the blunt grace of western modern dance. Khoo, much his junior, appears of fathomless age and gender - his smooth-skinned body is almost as untouched as a boy's and moves with a fluidity that to western eyes looks almost feminine. </p> <p>When the two men perform their jointly choreographed piece Cast in Stone? they make much of their differences. Bannerman is the centre of gravity who often sets the measured pace of their combined dancing (a two-way fusion of east and west). At other times he withdraws into a watchful presence, virtually effacing himself as Khoo blazes through dance that's almost narcissistic. On occasion, Bannerman is prince to Khoo's ballerina (the latter briefly dances on point), shouldering him in lifts and laying out the lines of his elegant body for our admiration. </p> <p>During the first half of this 40-minute piece, the agenda between the two is riveting. Superficially it evokes a sexual poignancy - Death in Venice revisited - but it also embodies the see-saw drama of an older man alternately placed as mentor and victim to youth. There is too the suggestion of another cultural story - western rationality in thrall to the ancient exoticism of the east. </p> <p>During the second half, though, the scenario fails to go any further. The dancers' personalities do not develop beyond the original suggestive premise of their partnership, and the choreography starts to look limited. As a result, the first section of the programme turns out to be a far more satisfying showcase for their talents. </p> <p>Khoo is quite simply an extraordinary dancer. In the supple Odissi style his performance looks like the embodiment of a beautiful voice - the melody unravelling through his limbs, the breath rising and settling through his torso with miraculous control. Dancing Bharat Natyam he is all glittering planes and angles, dividing and sub-dividing the mathematical rhythms of the movement with vertiginous accuracy. Bannerman, dancing Siobhan Davies's 1982 Swan Solo, defies nostalgia for the dancer he once was by shaping his movement with heroic clarity and pathos. Performed to Saint-Saens's famous music, his swan possesses a humanity that makes an incontrovertible case for the joy of watching older dancers. </p> <p> ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",
  "Chris Evans is set to donate up to \u00a31 million of his personal fortune to the Labour Party, marking the return of celebrity backing for Tony Blair. <p>Evans, the multimillionaire owner of Virgin Radio, has told friends that he will make a 'significant contribution' to Labour after he almost fell out with them over the race to be London Mayor. </p> <p>'He wants to show his support. He realises they need his help; he wants them to win the next election,' a friend said. Although Evans has not said how much he will give, the friend said it was likely to be a seven-figure sum. </p> <p>The donation will delight Labour, which has seen celebrities, once disparaged as 'Labour luvvies', slip away from the cause. One of these is Alan McGee, the man behind Oasis, who was a regular visitor to Downing Street before he lost heart with New Labour and accused Blair of following Tory policies, Last week the artist David Hockney accused the Government of being 'a lot more Philistine than the last lot'. </p> <p>His views echo similar criticisms made by Sir Vidia Naipaul, novelist Doris Lessing, former BBC executive John Tusa, and former Radio 3 Controller John Drummond, who called the Prime Minister a 'professional Philistine'. </p> <p>Evans, who regularly attends the Labour Party conference and was pictured two years ago dancing with Mo Mowlam and John Prescott, clashed with the party this year over the mayoral battle. </p> <p>Evans pledged \u00a3100,000 worth of support for Ken Livingstone when he ran against the official Labour candidate, Frank Dobson. 'As a core London voter, I can say that the legendary Livingstone against Frank is no competition,' Evans said at the time. 'Ken's got charisma. He is London. He's a leader. I like Frank Dobson a lot, but he is not a leader.' </p> <p>When Dobson made a joke about redheads, Evans promptly doubled his donation to the Livingstone campaign. His move led to an inquiry by the Radio Authority, which was concerned that he might be breaching political impartiality rules for radio stations. </p> <p>'What Frank Dobson said is very offensive to people with red hair,' Evans said. 'Kids growing up with red hair could be given a really tough time, especially if they have glasses.' </p> <p>The donation comes as Labour struggles to replenish its war chest, which totalled \u00a326m for the last general election. </p> <p>Although legislation going through Parliament will cap campaign funds at \u00a320m, party officials worry that, after the euphoria of 1997, it will be harder to raise the sums needed for modern campaigning. Labour is also concerned that Tory links with big business mean they will woo more lucrative donors.</p>",
  "Peter Mandelson is facing a fresh call for him to be removed as Northern Ireland Secretary by the Province's Deputy First Minister, Seamus Mallon. <p>Mallon's demand that Mandelson leave his post reflects nationalist concerns that the Secretary of State is diluting police reforms in a bid to shore up First Minister David Trimble. </p> <p>The rancour between Mallon, the SDLP Newry and Armagh MP, on one side, and Trimble and Mandelson on the other over policing threatens the overall stability of Northern Ireland's power-sharing coalition. </p> <p>Speaking in New York, Mallon was bitterly critical of Mandelson's handling of the Patten report into RUC reform. </p> <p>He told a meeting of the politically influential National Committee on Foreign Policy that every time nationalists try to be generous 'he [Mandelson] takes all, misrepresents your position and gives nothing'. </p> <p>The SDLP deputy leader said he was confident the policing debate would improve 'before Peter does any more damage'. </p> <p>He predicted that while he and First Minister Trimble might go eventually, the Good Friday Agreement would remain in place. As for the fate of the Northern Ireland Secretary, Mallon added: 'Peter, I hope, will [go].' </p> <p>The Irish government, the SDLP and Sinn Fein claim Mandelson has watered down key reforms to the RUC, including the dilution of local political controls Patten recommended should be imposed on the new Police Service of Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Mandelson warned nationalists last week not to become 'absolutist' about the Patten report - a clear acknowledgement that Trimble will need some concessions on policing to remain as Ulster Unionist Party leader and First Minister. </p> <p>Unionists have reacted furiously to Mallon's remarks highlighting the widening gap between the two main coalition partners in Belfast, the SDLP and the UUP. </p> <p>John Taylor MP, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists, said: 'My real concern is that Seamus Mallon is abusing his position as deputy First Minister. If he continues this line he will bring about the collapse of the Stormont Assembly because the unionist community will withdraw their support for him. He is beginning to go too far.' </p> <p>Taylor admitted that if his party loses this week's Westminister byelection in South Antrim, it would spell the end of the pro-Agreement unionist project and precipitate a collapse of the Assembly. </p> <p>Senior allies of David Trimble are worried that the unionist community will 'give Tony Blair a poke in the eye' by voting for the vehemently anti-Agreement candidate the Reverend William McCrea of Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party. </p> <p>A growing number of unionists fear the Patten report will give paramilitary-linked parties a degree of control over the new police force. They are also disillusioned with the release of paramilitary prisoners and the ongoing loyalist feud. Anti-Agreement unionists have pointed to the intra-loyalist violence as evidence that the political process has brought nothing but death and destruction to Protestant areas. </p> <p>Defeat for Trimble's candidate, the former British Airways press officer David Burnside, would undoubtedly provoke a leadership challenge at the UUP's conference next month. </p> <p>Burnside's team is focusing on a final publicity offensive against McCrea in a desperate bid to raise the UUP vote in South Antrim. </p> <p>They will point to McCrea's open association with the loyalist killer Billy 'King Rat' Wright, who was shot dead in the Maze prison two years ago. The DUP candidate stood on a public platform with Wright when the loyalist terrorist was expelled from the Ulster Volunteer Force for orchestrating violence at Drumcree in 1996 and order ing the murder of Catholic taxi driver Michael McGoldrick. </p> <p>The UUP election team will also remind voters of McCrea's record of voting at Westminster when he was MP for Mid Ulster. The former DUP MP failed to turn up for the crucial Maastricht treaty vote in the Commons in July 1993 because he was on holiday in the United States.</p>",
  "The role of government and what it should do to advance the cause of liberty was a raging debate when I was elected to Parliament in 1983. Then, one of the voguish ideas in town was 'libertarianism', which motivated a generation of excitable Young Conservatives to 'roll back the frontiers of the state'. <p>In my view, as a country we need to rediscover some of that scepticism about government and revisit that libertarian agenda. But we need to do it in a very different way and we should reach some different conclusions. Then, libertarians rightly wanted a market economy, but they wrongly wanted a market society, in which the cash bottom line counted above all else. They did tremendous damage to civic Britain. </p> <p>And though they spoke the language of individual rights, they were profoundly hostile to policies that would promote alternative lifestyles and diverse cultures. In contrast to that libertarian agenda, we need a liberal agenda, where government refuses to interfere in the lives of individuals, but plays a very active role wherever it can advance liberty for everyone. </p> <p>The liberal agenda has four key principles. First, government cannot solve all problems, and sometimes does more harm than good. Second, some problems are best left to government. It is far more able than the private sector to deliver health and education services that successfully tackle inequality. Third, we need clearer rules defining what government can and can't do; many decisions need to be taken at local and regional levels, rather than at Westminster. Fourth, central authority should be used to stamp out inequality rather than enforcing conformity. </p> <p>There is a curious assumption that individual freedom means the withdrawal of the state, and that taxation is a form of state control. The opposite should be the case. Taxation, efficiently gathered and efficiently spent, is not a curb on personal freedom - it is the means to achieve it. </p> <p>When power is exercised exclusively at the centre, the result is rigidity of rules and alienation of the people subject to those rules. This does not simply apply to the way Westminster retains control over the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly; it also applies to questions of lifestyle and parenting. </p> <p>New Labour needs to realise that family life and the way we raise our children are private matters. In its policies, we have seen, for example, serious attempts to discourage lone parents from staying at home with their children. Measures such as the New Deal and the Working Families Tax Credit encourage parents into a rigid model where the only way they can stay above the breadline is to work from nine to five, regardless of the needs of their children. This is grossly out of step with modern values. </p> <p>No government body is more notorious for over-legislation than the Department of Trade and Industry. There are numerous DTI regulations that are burdensome, unnecessary and undesirable. For instance, the so-called 'Tea Bag' tax forces employers to quote any free tea and coffee they lay on for employees as a 'taxable benefit in kind'. This is often impossible to calculate, but in one notorious case, an employer was fined \u00a36,000 by the Inland Revenue. Providing sandwiches can also be dangerous, since current legislation classes it as a taxable benefit as well as one which attracts National Insurance. Under such excessive legislation, employers find themselves with an incentive not to provide anything for their employees. </p> <p>Section 9 of the Conservative government's 1996 Immigration Act is no more forgiving. It makes it a duty of employers to police the visas and passports of their employees, threatening them with hefty fines if they allow people without the correct paperwork to continue working. This does not deter illegal immigrants from seeking work, since they are not penalised. It does, however, deter employers from hiring anyone foreign, out of the fear that they might land themselves in trouble. </p> <p>Under the Parental Leave Directive, employers who grant paternity leave can find themselves subject to criminal proceedings if the Inland Revenue judge their record-keeping to be sub-standard. Rather than spend time making certain their records are in order, many companies choose to avoid the risk by simply not granting paid paternity leave. We need to examine existing and pending legislation to ensure that it is clear, precise and, above all, minimal. We need to change the culture of government, so those in charge of the rule book come to understand that 'less equals more'. </p> <p>Government also needs to start respecting professionalism within the public sector, and curbing its desire to satiate people like teachers and nurses with paperwork and excessive regulation. Speaking to numerous teachers and nurses, I am consistently struck by the sense of mission they have about their work. But teachers report being unable to plan lessons with any degree of creativity, because they are too bound up with form-filling. Their paperwork has multiplied over the last decade, as have the number of rules governing the level of permissible contact between teachers and their pupils. Young people are reluctant to join these professions because they are not sufficiently respected in society. A telling feature of that lack of respect is the extent to which government over-legislates, thus lowering the status of and morale within these professions. </p> <p>When Labour came to power, tax was charged at 15 different levels. The budget of March 2000 took that figure to 38. There used to be three rates of income tax - now there are five. There were three levels of capital gains tax - now there are 21. This situation provides the opposite of transparency for the average citizen. It is very difficult for people and businesses to know how much tax they owe, and why. </p> <p>This proliferation of taxes also provides a smokescreen, whereby New Labour can claim to be helping people, but hitting them by less obvious means - so-called 'stealth taxes'. For instance, the Treasury claimed that the tax burden on the 'average family' has fallen to its lowest level since 1972. It only takes a little analysis to see that this 'average' family would have to be non-smoking, non-drinking, never fly abroad on holiday, not pay a mortgage and not pay council tax. These tactics undermine public confidence in government. The end-result of this undermining will be further alienation. The cynicism and disrespect with which people currently view the Government is a worrying sign that Labour is already losing the support it coveted for so many years, precisely because it is holding on to it so tightly. </p> <p>Restricting the freedom of individuals, pinning businesses and professionals down with legislation and befogging them with stealth taxes engenders a culture where government is viewed as an obstacle to success, not the means to achieve it. Britain deserves better. </p> <p>Charles Kennedy is leader of the Liberal Democratic Party</p>",
  "Major Alan Marshall, the commander of the Royal Irish Regiment's patrol into the Occra Hills of Sierra Leone, knew he was taking a calculated risk as he pored over his military maps with his driver. With the three open-topped Land Rovers of his 11-man patrol pulled up in the humid heat of the Leonean bush, he contemplated his choices: to return with his soldiers to the relative security of the British mission's base at Benguema Training Camp, or to head off the Tarmac road onto a red laterite track, bordered by low scrub, and 'check out' two villages along the Rokel creek. <p>It is a decision that Marshall will rue for the rest of his career - for what he decided in that instant set in train events that would see Marshall and his men captured, disarmed, beaten and humiliated by one of Sierra Leone's most notorious militias. It would see three British soldiers die: two of them, say sources, killed in training in Kenya for Marshall's rescue. A third would die and a dozen would be injured in a blazing 90-minute battle that accompanied the rescue. - a raid, one Parachute Regiment insider would later complain, that came perilously close to disaster. </p> <p>The official report into Marshall's conduct - copied to both Tony Blair and the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook - has already accused him of a 'grave mistake'. But now, as senior officers continue their post-mortem into the kidnapping and its aftermath, the question they are asking is whether Marshall alone was to blame, or whether the world's most professional armed forces badly underestimated the fighting capabilities and threat posed by a drunken and brutal militia force, with tragic consequences. </p> <p>But it was always Marshall's call. As the British infantry covering force commander, he was tasked with gathering intelligence about friendly and potentially hostile forces. Intelligence reports suggested that the area was quiet. And as Britain's youngest major, and an exceptional officer marked down for a fast track to promotion, his friends and colleagues were not surprised that he took the initiative - and the attendant risk - of 'pushing out' towards Magbeni village. </p> <p>It was a moment of overconfidence that would resonate at the highest levels, embarrassing the Blair Government over his politically sensitive military programme to train and rearm the beleaguered government forces in Sierra Leone. </p> <p>And it is not only the official inquiries that Marshall will have to face. Already he is facing the judgment of his peers. 'Officers are taught at staff college to gather intelligence at every opportunity,' said a senior defence source. 'One would expect Marshall to test the information he had received. But a prudent officer would also always make sure he had an escape route and certainly not allow himself to be surrounded. Perhaps he thought the West Side Boys were friendlies,' he added. 'Big mistake.' </p> <p>The first that the self-styled 'Brigadier' Foday Kally - commander of the pro-government militia, the West Side Boys - knew of the mission to rescue Marshall and his men was when he was woken by the sounds of gunfire and explosions as Operation Barras rocked his headquarters compound in the village of Gberi Bana, shortly before dawn last Sunday morning. </p> <p>From the north, soldiers of D Squadron of 22 SAS had infiltrated the perimeter of the village from the surrounding bush, where they had been observing the compound from their hideouts for a fortnight. To the south, armed frogmen of the Special Boat Service had crossed the creek underwater, closing on the buildings where Marshall and his men were held. Alerted in a coded message on the previous day, the hostages were waiting for the attack. Almost simultaneously, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment's 1st Battalion attacked the village of Magabeni on the creek's opposite bank, abseiling in from their Chinook helicopters, to prevent other militia from sending in reinforcements. </p> <p>It is this phase of the operation that has come in for criticism from military insiders. For while the first phase of the raid - to grab the hostages - appears to have gone off without problems, sources say that it became bogged down as more British troops poured into the two villages, meeting unexpectedly stiff resistance from Kallay's undisciplined fighters. </p> <p>A Parachute Regiment source said: 'It was, as they say, a damned close-run thing. It was just that far from being a total fuck-up. You've got to ask why we took so many hits. Taking one in 10 is fairly serious. We are pretty lucky not to have lost more, given the number of wounded. Who the fuck did they think these [West Side] Boys were? Someone was being very over-confident if they thought they would all just leg it when they heard fire.' </p> <p>The answer goes to the heart of a string of military blunders by Western forces in Africa in the past decade: in Somalia, Rwanda and in Sierra Leone - an arrogant refusal to accept that lightly armed, shambolic forces from another culture can threaten our professional soldiers. </p> <p>In Sierra Leone, it was a complacency in evidence even before the capture of Marshall and his men, hemmed in as they became trapped on the road to Magbeni by 25 of Kally's irregulars and a pick-up armed with twin-mounted guns on 25 August. It was a complacency summed up by the comments of one of the most senior British officers with the training mission, that 'jungle fighting' in Africa comprised 'both sides firing in the air until the most scared runs away'. </p> <p>Instead, as both Marshall and his rescuers discovered to their cost, the West Side Boys (men, women and children) were prepared to stand their ground. 'It is the old problem,' said another soldier familiar with Sierra Leone. 'We just don't get it. We look at these irregular forces. We look at these kids and young women fighting in trainers and T- shirts. We laugh at the way they wear charms to ward off bullets. We look at their drunken and doped-up leaders and we cannot take them seriously. But these kids have grown up fighting and killing and committing atrocities. </p> <p>'They also don't understand the rules. No one has ever told them that war is not like a Rambo video, about how soldiers should behave, when to be scared, so they will just stand there and blast away.' </p> <p>What happens next to Marshall is in the hands of the Commander-in-Chief of UK Land Forces, General Sir Mike Jackson. Already it seems certain that Marshall will not face a court martial. Senior defence sources are said to have been impressed by the way he attempted to defend his men from the West Side Boys during his capture, sustaining a savage beating. They are impressed that he has not sought to avoid blame - telling officers who interviewed him that he alone was responsible for the debacle. 'If Marshall can convince an inquiry that he simply made a mistake by acting on his own initiative, his career will not be damaged,' said a senior source. 'But if he is found negligent in any way a public example will made of him.' </p> <p>In his 'naming and shaming' by the Army in the past three days, Marshall may feel this has already happened.</p>",
  "A nuclear catastrophe - triggered by a fault in Russia's ageing electrical grid - was averted last week thanks to a 'heroic' emergency operation by power station workers. <p>Details of how one of Russia's main nuclear plants and the country's largest plutonium-processing centre came close to disaster emerged slowly, prompting new alarm in a country still reeling from a string of disasters. </p> <p>Nuclear experts said 'courageous' workers at the Beloyarsk power station and the Mayak reprocessing plant had managed to prevent a Chernobyl-style accident. Environmental campaigners warned that the crumbling state of Russia's infrastructure meant such close escapes could be expected with growing frequency. </p> <p>Preliminary investigations showed that a short circuit in the regional electricity system caused a sudden blackout in three nuclear reactors in the Urals. Its cause remains unclear, although it has been widely attributed to a fault in the poorly maintained network. </p> <p>Unexpected power cuts at nuclear plants, which are designed to work ceaselessly, pose a severe risk. There was controversy yesterday over whether built-in emergency electricity systems took over as they should have done. Minatom, Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy, insisted that all back-up systems at both sites began working in the seconds after the accident, but environmental activists reported that the standby electricity generators of at least one of the reactors had failed to start. </p> <p>These sources say a technical hitch at the Beloyarsk plant, in the Sverdlovsk region, meant that the diesel generators built into the reactor failed to start automatically. Without a separate supply of electricity, the cooling system at the heart of the plant allegedly stopped working - causing the temperature in the core reactor to soar to dangerous levels, as workers lost control over the chain reactions occurring within. </p> <p>'The problem was that the diesel generators were in poor condition and so the staff on the plant needed 36 minutes to repair them to get them started,' said Vladimir Slivyak, co-chairman of the Ecodefence organisation, which has spent the past week gathering information about the mishap. 'It was up to the personnel on the plant to avert a serious nuclear accident. They worked heroically.' </p> <p>Alexei Yablokov of the Centre for Ecological Problems of Russia endorsed this view: 'We were just half an hour from another Chernobyl - had it not been for the professionalism of the plant staff.' </p> <p>At around lunchtime on Saturday last weekend, a crash echoed from within the walls of the Beloyarsk compound. Local residents - many of whom were celebrating the annual town festival - listened in horror. Most of the people who live in Zarechny, the settlement which has grown up around the plant, are either current or former employees - so were well equipped to judge the gravity of the noise. </p> <p>The precise cause of the sound remains unclear. Unconfirmed sources suggest that while technicians struggled to get the diesel generators working, they were forced to shut down the reactor manually. Residents may have heard steam spurting suddenly from the cooling plant, as pressure in the system mounted. </p> <p>One of the immediate results of the shutdown at Beloyarsk was a power failure at the nearby Mayak processing plant in the Chelyabinsk region, where two reactors were in operation. </p> <p>The potential consequences of malfunction at the vast, high-security Mayak plant are no less alarming. Scientists there take spent nuclear fuel from all over the former Soviet Union and convert it into weapons-grade plutonium and high-level waste. The site is estimated to contain 120 million curies of radioactive waste - much of it held in liquid form in vast tanks - including seven times the amount of strontium-90 and caesium-137 that was released in Chernobyl. </p> <p>Mayak was without power for 45 minutes and the reactors were automatically shut down. The head of the plant, Vitaliy Sadovnikov, told a local newspaper that this was the worst blackout the station had faced and it was only his staff's 'near-military discipline' which prevented a serious accident. </p> <p>He said the back-up electricity provider, designed to cool down the reactors in the event of such an emergency, had only been started up 30 minutes after the plant was brought to a halt. </p> <p>But yesterday Bulat Nigmatulin, a Deputy Minister at Minatom, said these reports were lies. 'This unpleasant situation came about because for the first time there was a breakdown in the local energy system,' he said. </p> <p>'The atomic installations at Beloyarsk and Mayak are protected against this kind of accident, and on this occasion everything went exactly according to plan, with on-site emergency electricity sources starting up immediately.' </p> <p>He said 30-minute delays would have led to explosions in the reactors. </p> <p>Officials at both plants report there was no radiation contamination as a result of the emergency shutdowns. Environmental activists in the region continue to test the site, but are so far satisfied that this is the case. </p> <p>Although a crisis was averted, analysts agree that both mishaps are sobering examples of the ease with which a disaster could be sparked. </p> <p>'The fact that the grid was down for 45 minutes is extremely alarming, because it means that control was temporarily lost in these crucial nuclear installations,' said Tobias Muenchmeyer, atomic energy expert with Greenpeace. </p> <p>Some commentators linked the initial power cut to the campaign by Russia's electricity monopoly to cut off those customers with outstanding debts. They speculated that by suddenly switching off one area of the grid, Unified Energy Systems might have precipitated the short circuit. UES officials deny this, and a government commission has been set up to investigate. </p> <p>State officials are eager to promote atomic energy as a means of heating and powering their vast country. A strategy document published by Minatom in May advocated that Russia should radically increase its nuclear capacity over the next 20 years, building up to 24 new reactors. </p> <p>Independent experts affirm that over the past five years the number of emergency shutdowns in Russian reactors has dropped fourfold, and over the past two years financing of safety monitoring has increased. But the memory of the Chernobyl disaster 14 years ago remains uncomfortably fresh.</p>",
  "The price of peace in Northern Ireland for the Ministry of Defence may run to \u00a315 million. Thanks to the IRA ceasefires, the MoD is being sued for 'breach of contract and negligence'. <p>An Ulster-based construction company has issued a High Court writ against defence chiefs for multimillion-pound damages. J.H. Turkington &amp; Sons of Portadown claims that in December 1992 the company was contracted by the MoD to carry out a huge building programme to protect army and RUC bases in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The military said that the work was 'urgently required' to fortify army barracks and police stations in response to the threat posed by the IRA's Mark 15 'barrack buster' mortars. </p> <p>At the time the IRA was carrying out an intensified campaign against the security forces with mortar bombs capable of piercing the fortifications around police and army bases. </p> <p>According to the writ, the company, which traded as Northern Builders, was asked by leading army officers to make 'suitable hardened structures' to strengthen security at the bases. </p> <p>The value of the emergency programme was estimated at \u00a3300m and the contract was meant to run for 10 years, the company claims. But then the IRA declared its first ceasefire on 31 August 1994 and three months later the MoD informed the company that the programme was being halted. </p> <p>The company claims that, as a result of the fortification contract being terminated, it is now owed \u00a315m in compensation and expenses for research, redevelopment and tooling. </p> <p>The MoD has filed a defence denying any liability and is also disputing the claim for damages. </p> <p>The case is expected to be heard at Belfast High Court in January, when a senior army officer involved in the original contract returns from a tour of duty in Kosovo. </p> <p>Legal sources in Belfast said that no written contracts had been exchanged between the company and the MoD. At the time the ministry wanted the work done as a matter of urgency, given the IRA's sustained Mark 15 attacks. </p> <p>The programme resulted in some bases having their outer walls fortified. The company also built an inner bunker inside several army and police stations known as 'The Cube', which was constructed to resist heavy mortar blasts. </p> <p>Israeli military engineers were flown in to design the fortifications. They used anti-blast technology they had developed while building military and government bases in Israel, the occupied territories and the former buffer zone in Lebanon. </p> <p>The Mark 15 'barrack buster' mortar was the most devastating weapon in the Provisional IRA's arsenal. A Provo engineer who lives along the South Armagh-Louth border and has since defected to the Real IRA developed it. </p> <p>The weapon, consisting of six gas cylinder tubes, each packed with 20kg of explosives, is welded to the trailer of a flatbed lorry before being fired over a perimeter wall using a remote control mechanism. The mechanism is similar to those used to trigger the smaller mortar bombs that were fired at Heathrow in 1994, causing widespread chaos at the world's largest airport. Between 1992 and 1994 the 'barrack buster' was fired in more than 50 attacks on RUC and army bases. </p> <p>The Real IRA used it again last Tuesday when the terror group launched an attack on a police station in Armagh City. No one was injured, but the blast confirmed fears that the dissident group now has the technical expertise to breach army and police fortifications. In July 1998 the Real IRA carried out a botched attack with the Mark 15 on a police station in Newry, Co Down.</p>",
  "<p>Record numbers of parents are challenging decisions by education authorities on which schools their children should attend, in a 'collective panic' which is wasting precious school resources, according to new research. </p> <p>Figures revealed in a study by the Institute for Public Policy Research show a rise of more than 50 per cent since 1995 in the number of appeals. Authors of the report believe that parents from all socio-economic backgrounds are now taking on the system when children are rejected by first-choice schools. In some areas, the report says, this has led to 'sink schools'. </p> <p>'There is no doubt that, in certain pockets of neighbourhoods, parental choice is breeding a collective panic, one that uses up irrational amounts of precious school time and resources,' said Joe Hallgarten, who wrote the IPPR report. </p> <p>Tony Blair is the most-high profile figure to benefit from the system, introduced in 1988. He sent his sons to the grant-maintained London Oratory school far from their home in Islington, north London. Now tens of thousands of other parents are following his example. More than 85,000 appeals were lodged by parents last year. More are expected this year. </p> <p>From October parents will be able to take their case to the High Court under European Rights Legislation claiming that their right to choose the school their child attends has been infringed. </p> <p>'It is virtually taken for granted that, where possible, parents should be able to choose the school that their child attends,' said Hallgarten, author of the IPPR report. </p> <p>Though the effect is 'generally beneficial' it can have a 'significant negative impact' on many schools. Those lower down school league tables suffer from falling intake and thus receive less resources. They are also legally bound to take children rejected by other schools and thus disaffected, difficult children, and those of less ability, become concentrated. A 'vicious circle' is set up. </p> <p>The number of appeals is often highest in areas which have schools at both ends of the league tables and a broad range of backgrounds, such as Enfield local education authority in north London. It received the largest number of appeals in England last year, with almost 60 per cent of children who failed to get into the secondary school of their choice registering a formal complaint. </p> <p>One Welsh LEA was forced to hold mass hearings this year after every one of the 1,000 parents whose children were rejected lodged a formal complaint. In Islington 40 per cent of children go to secondary schools outside the borough, which Hallgarten says has hurt Islington's schools' performances, possibly irrevocably. </p> <p>When the Conservatives introduced the Act in 1988 they claimed it would improve the quality of schools and widen the variety of education available. </p> <p>But the report challenges that. 'Oversubscribed schools can choose their children in either overt or subtle ways and even affect the structure of the housing market in their area,' said Hallgarten.</p>",
  "It sounds like a slick bank heist. Half a dozen young men wearing balaclavas and designer tracksuits break into a security guard's office, force him to lie face down and threaten to break his legs if he tries to intervene. Then, after overriding a series of electronic locks, they ransack the building's inner sanctum. <p>But the robbers who broke into Edinburgh Unversity's computing building last Saturday were not seeking cash. They had targeted the campus's Sun Microsystems computer hardware and within eight minutes had ripped out hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of chips and motherboards before driving off in a white panel van. </p> <p>It was an audacious robbery by any standards. But what alarmed police and university chiefs was the familiarity of the crime - for over the past few months the same gang has robbed a British campus of the same type of equipment virtually every week. This was their second raid on Edinburgh. </p> <p>Millions of pounds worth of the filing-cabinet-sized computers - all made by Sun Microsystems - have been stolen from UK universities this year. In the past few months, universities at Bradford, Dundee, Manchester, Aberdeen and several other cities have been raided. </p> <p>Police believe the computers have been stolen 'to order' either by criminals setting up offshore pornography websites in the Cayman Islands or by groups in former Soviet Union countries that are struggling to get round US technology export bans. </p> <p>'These are powerful computer servers capable of mighty database searches and number crunching exercises,' an expert told The Observer . 'Ten years ago, only major government defence laboratories could have afforded them. Today they are commonplace pieces of kit in all university research departments. You could design an atom bomb on one of these things.' </p> <p>What has also alarmed police chiefs is the gang's growing sophistication. They first struck at Edinburgh University in May when they broke into the campus computing department, battered their way through several doors, and ripped out processors from Sun machines. Four months later they returned armed with devices that allowed them to bypass all of the university's newly installed electronic security devices and reach their target without setting off alarms. </p> <p>'This is the work of a very professional gang who are well organised and would have few qualms about using violence,' said Lothian police. 'The security guard was left very shaken. There was nothing he could do to prevent the robbery.' </p> <p>The designer clothing worn by the raiders was later recovered in a toilet at Edinburgh's Cameron Toll Shopping Centre. Police believe the speed of the raid suggest the gang were using radio frequency scanners to ensure they left before the police arrived. Nor did they leave behind any forensic evidence. </p> <p>Previous raids have shown equal levels of sophistication. When the gang broke into Manchester University, they entered through the roof of the computer services department and went straight to the \u00a325 million mainframe, stealing a motherboard and several chips worth a total of \u00a3200,000. Other, equally expensive computers in the same room were ignored, fuelling the theory that the thefts are carried out to order. The gang is believed to spend several days scouting out potential targets and checking the position of CCTV cameras before embarking on a robbery. The large number of visitors to campuses means they have little difficulty pinpointing targets. At Edinburgh, access to the James Clerk Maxwell building, which houses the computer department, is unrestricted and students often work through the night. </p> <p>Sun Microsystems produce the hardware, software and service support to most of the major websites in the world. As use of the worldwide web continues to grow, the company has seen its value triple in the last year to more than \u00a3160 billion. Because of the sophisticated nature of the systems, the price of second- hand or stolen parts are often as high as those direct from the manufactuers. </p> <p>The FBI, which has a specialist squad looking into the theft of sophisticated computer parts, believes that trade has the potential to eclipse many other areas of crime and that computer components are increasingly being used as currency by drug gangs. 'Rather than risk trying to move cash across international borders, they simply transport the computer parts,' said an agent. 'At present, it is almost impossible for law enforcement officials to ascertain whether such parts are stolen or not.'</p>",
  "The Vatican has given a clear signal that it is considering softening its historic opposition to the use of condoms. <p>A leading member of the influential Pontifical Council on the Family has admitted that condom use may be the 'lesser of two evils' as the Roman Catholic church acknowledges the extent of the global Aids epidemic. </p> <p>In the Vatican-published L'Osservatore Romano, Monsignor Jacques Suaudeau writes: 'If people want to prevent Aids, they must be convinced to change their sexual behaviour. Until a real effort is made in this regard... the prophylactic is one of the ways to \"contain\" the sexual transmission of HIV and Aids.' </p> <p>The move has sent shockwaves through the church. 'This is very significant,' said a spokesman for Britain's Catholic media office yesterday. 'L'Osservatore has become a platform for the exploration of issues on which there might be a change in the official line of the Vatican at some point in the future.' </p> <p>Suaudeau is careful to emphasise that traditional monogamy is his preferred method of Aids prevention. 'Family values guarantee true human victory,' he claims. 'Wherever there is true education in the values of the family, of fidelity, of marital chastity, man will achieve a human victory, even over this terrible phenomenon. There is no hope of halting the HIV epidemic with condoms alone, just as there is no hope of preventing a river from flooding by using sandbags when the main dykes have collapsed.' </p> <p>But his acknowledgement that condoms may be part of a strategy to prevent HIV is a stark departure for the church. </p> <p>In the Sixties a pontifical commission on contraception recommended that Rome should lift its ban on artificial birth control. Catholics had expected Pope Paul VI to accept that recommendation. Instead, when he published his encyclical Humane Vitae he stoutly rejected any change. </p> <p>Suaudeau's latest suggestion is consistent with accepted Catholic teaching on use of the birth control pill, which is permitted to correct severe menstrual irregularities, even though it also prevents conception. </p> <p>Lisa Power, of British HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'We welcome anything that goes towards recognising the reality of the HIV epidemic. It is also good news for Catholic couples, of course.'</p>",
  "Two years ago, she was hailed as an angel of mercy; a courageous nurse who struggled with her conscience before putting elderly, terminally ill patients out of their misery. She won praise from her patients' relatives, and even from the Health Minister. <p>But last week in a French court Christine Mal\u00e8vre was described as a megalomaniac with a morbid fascination for illness and death who should be treated as a murderer. </p> <p>The astounding story of Mal\u00e8vre and her alleged transformation from saint to serial killer started at the hospital she worked in at Mantes-la-Jolie, near Paris, where she was nicknamed 'The Black Widow' by colleagues because so many patients died in her care. In May 1998, the hospital's director became suspicious and reported the case to the public prosecutor. </p> <p>When questioned, Mal\u00e8vre initially admitted assisting 30 terminally ill cancer patients to die between February 1997 and May 1998. She later changed her story, and claimed she had helped only four to die by administering lethal doses of morphine. </p> <p>Soon afterwards the Mal\u00e8vre affair became public, making the nurse a focus for a debate over the ethics of euthanasia in France. She was condemned by the Catholic Church, but hailed by campaigners seeking a change in the law on mercy killings. </p> <p>MPs demanded a parliamentary debate about euthanasia as a result of her stance. </p> <p>But last week Mal\u00e8vre, 30, was accused of seven counts of murder and committed to stand trial next year. If convicted, she could face 30 years' jail. </p> <p>Olivier Morice, the lawyer representing four families of patients who died in Mal\u00e8vre's care at the Fran\u00e7ois-Quesnay hospital between 1997 and 1998, said: 'She was not the champion of euthanasia, as she wanted to be seen. She should be regarded as a serial killer rather than someone motivated by compassion.' </p> <p>Her lawyer, Charles Libman, said his client should be cleared on all counts since the link between her actions and the patients' deaths had not been established. </p> <p>It was the decision of families of the deceased to file suit against the nurse that brought the case before a court in Versailles last week. Until last year it was widely believed that Mal\u00e8vre had acted at the request of the patients' families or the patients themselves. </p> <p>At that time, no relatives had accused the nurse of any wrongdoing. The investigating magistrate had shown that she was not acting for money, in her own interests or at the behest of any pro-euthanasia association. </p> <p>As a result, the magistrate ordered the nurse to be freed. She subsequently received psychiatric treatment in a sanatorium west of Paris before leaving the region to try to rebuild her life as a packer in a remote part of Normandy. </p> <p>The bereaved families' suspicions were only aroused several months after their relatives' deaths. Alain Le Maout, whose wife Denise died at Mantes-la-Jolie in 1997, recounted how Mal\u00e8vre had telephoned his home on the morning of 9 November,1997, and said he must come to the hospital urgently. </p> <p>He claims that the nurse then called the hospital's resuscitation unit, described Denise's symptoms, and was told to administer an injection to ease a small epileptic fit. </p> <p>'At 10 o'clock, when I arrived, Denise had just enough energy to turn to me and smile before she died in my arms,' said Le Maout, who now believes Mal\u00e8vre may have administered a lethal injection of morphine to his wife. </p> <p>After his wife's death, Le Maout said he received an invitation to Mal\u00e8vre's wedding. He claims he was then contacted by a friend whose husband had died at the hospital under suspicious circumstances. 'When she told me that she had also been invited to the wedding, I asked myself, \"Since when have nurses invited to their weddings widows and widowers of people who died in their care?\" ' </p> <p>He was also told that Mal\u00e8vre was writing a book about euthanasia called My Confession . This made him suspicious about what had happened at the hospital on the morning of 9 November. Mal\u00e8vre has not commented on the circumstances surrounding Denise Le Maout's death. </p> <p>Hospital officials have alleged that Mal\u00e8vre may have been affected after witnessing the death of a 76-year-old woman who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. In March 1996, the patient's husband had shot her dead on the ward and then taken his own life, leaving a letter saying he could not bear to see his wife in such suffering. </p> <p>When Mal\u00e8vre was first detained two years ago, the then Health Minister, Bernard Kouchner, said: 'I feel great compassion for this nurse, who must not be made to feel alone and lost, like so many sick people isolated and cloistered in wards where people are watching them die.' But while he admitted the subject was 'neither discussed enough nor taken seriously enough' in France, he said euthanasia was unacceptable under French law. </p> <p>The right-to-die debate has long been taboo in France. Even the word euthanasia does not feature in the penal code. Unlike the Netherlands, where doctors are guaranteed freedom from prosecution as long as they fulfil certain strict conditions, French law treats active euthanasia - administering a substance likely to hasten death - as murder. </p> <p>'I am not opposed to euthanasia,' Le Maout said last week. 'In fact, my wife, her doctor and myself considered it as a possibility if her illness became too painful to bear.' He claims, however, that Denise was getting better. </p> <p>He said he was pleased the nurse would stand trial for his wife's murder, but added: 'Knowing she is still at liberty, after admitting involvement in four deaths and being accused of seven murders, revolts me. I am fundamentally non-violent, but today I cannot say what I would do if by chance I came face to face with Christine Mal\u00e8vre.'</p>",
  "<p>The official deadline for completing your tax return is just 12 days away if you want the Inland Revenue to calculate your bill for the year 1999-2000. But don't panic if there's no chance of getting your return in by 30 September. </p> <p>The Revenue prefers tax returns to be submitted by this date because it allows sufficient time to deal with all the forms before the second payment is due on 31 January. But the Revenue will still do the calculation for you if the return is late - even by a matter of weeks. </p> <p>Tax experts say that it is much more important to ensure that your return is correct than on time. Many people assume the Revenue will check the form for mistakes. But your tax liability is calculated by a computer that simply crunches the numbers fed in by a Revenue employee. If that employee is experienced, he or she may spot your errors. But there is no guarantee. </p> <p>Likewise, you should check the resulting bill. The National Audit Office checked 3,400 calculations last year and found that 6 per cent were incorrect because Revenue staff had introduced errors. As about 9 million people are expected to file returns this year, 540,000 could find their tax bills are wrong through no fault of their own. </p> <p>Eight per cent of 'corrections' made by Inland Revenue staff to obvious errors in returns were also wrong. Worryingly, the amendment of PAYE tax codes to collect balancing payments were dealt with incorrectly in 27 per cent of cases. </p> <p>However, don't put off paying your tax bill until the sums have been checked. The Revenue will charge you 8.5 per cent interest on any amount that is found to be outstanding. </p> <p>It would be easy to place all the blame for this scrappy service on the Inland Revenue. But the Government must share the criticism. At a time when the Revenue should be concentrating its efforts on making self-assessment work smoothly, the Government has burdened it with responsibility for running the complicated Working Families Tax Credit and for policing the national minimum wage. The Inland Revenue needs more staff, better training and an urgent review of its systems. </p> <p>If you are having problems with your tax return and cannot afford professional advice, the charity TaxAid may be able to help.

  "<p>After three weeks of working on our hamlet, things are beginning to take shape. Two habitable houses have been wired up in the hope that we will soon be connected to the power mains. For reasons particular to our property, this is taking longer than we expected. </p> <p>On the positive side, however, the plumber has devised a clever system of bringing water from the spring outside directly into our house without the use of a single bucket. We now have an impressive collection of pipes and tanks, and a water pump in the basement. Rather than relying on a hill to provide pressure for a shower, we now have a water pump that springs into action when pressure is low and keeps the tank full. We also have two splendid flushing loos which work . Having encountered groups of five or more sangliers (wild boar) snuffling around the terraces and gardens at night, their tusks glinting in the moonlight, I'm very relieved that the khazi al fresco is no longer a necessity. Boars can be dangerous if cornered, and running with your trousers around your ankles is not the best way to escape. </p> <p>We now even have a big shiny water heater in the basement, which will give us 300 litres of piping hot water. But for the whole plumbing system to work properly, we need constant electricity. </p> <p>And while keeping warm is a worry in winter, refrigeration was a necessity this summer, when temperatures reached about 40 C in the shade. Tins don't suffer so much, but any fresh produce was crawling out of the door within a few hours of leaving the market. </p> <p>I made the mistake of buying some meat; it lasted a day before turning into a seething mass of white maggots. This encouraged us to dabble with vegetarianism, but I can't see that as a long-term solution. </p> <p>Lack of electricity is our major stumbling block. We got into a quasi routine of running a generator for a noisy couple of hours a day in an attempt to keep the hot water hot, the fridge anything cooler than lukewarm and the water tank filled. But it had a habit of breaking down, usually when I was showering and had a headful of shampoo. </p> <p>The subsequent silence was deafening. After a few breakdowns, we learnt how to check the spark-plug, oil and fuel, but inevitably an embarrassing call to the electrician would follow, with us begging him to fix the recalcitrant machine. </p> <p>A mason is starting work soon to save the wall of the fourth house. The lack of a roof means water gets into the mortarless walls: the stones give up the unequal struggle and fall away. The mason needs to take down the wall completely and rebuild it. He was going to construct some sort of ledge to prevent future rainfall damaging the wall, but, since he is there and the scaffolding will be in place, it seems wiser to go the whole hog and have a new roof put on now. </p> <p>Our budget wasn't quite prepared for this, but in the long run it will be cheaper than asking the mason and his team to make a return visit. We will therefore have one more habitable house. </p> <p>Plans are afoot to replace another roof - one our predecessors misguidedly modernised in a rather ugly material called 'shingle', adding three dormer windows that don't really fit with the 300-year-old look. Although this gave it more light, aesthetically it's a total disaster. Monsieur le Ma\u00e7on is therefore going to replace it with old terracotta tiles to match the other roofs. </p> <p>On each of his visits we have asked his advice on all the walls, roofs and buildings in general. One wall seems a strange shape, a leak persists here, and there is a missing window there. He looks at the problem in question, sighs heavily and says: 'It's not a priority, but we'll have to sort it out.' </p> <p>I have a suspicion that we shall get to know him rather well as time goes on. He instigated the first stage of this friendship by arriving one night with a box of sausages and several bottles of good wine for us all to share. All we were able to offer in return was a look at the moon through the telescope but he seemed quite pleased with that - especially when the mayor's children, who had joined the party, convinced him that they could see a Martian on a bicycle. </p> <p>Never a dull moment on our mountain. </p> <p>Shuttered up at the end of the holidays, when the weather had the courtesy to cloud over for the first time, the houses looked vulnerable - open to the elements and to all kinds of intruders. </p> <p>I can't help feeling that I should be there full-time to look after them.</p>",
  "<p>Ever the gentleman, Sacha Distel pops out to receive us at the gate of his Paris town house: not so tall and not so young, but still tanned and fairly lovely - in a mini-series kind of way - in Lacoste and Levi's. As he leads the way indoors, through the hall and up the stairs, I have time to admire a brilliant proliferation of mirrors, a series of 19th-century English fox-hunting prints, and the fact that Monsieur Distel, to judge from the leather patch attached to the rear of his jeans, maintains a 32-inch waist. </p> <p>Honestly, it's freaky how little wear and tear he exhibits. The only concessions to the long years of touring are the crows' feet fanning out from the corners of his famous green eyes - one of which has a slight cast as a result of an 80s car crash - and the vaguest hint of badger at his temples. 'My first British agent always told me, \"Jus' give them the eyes and the teeth,\"' he remarks later, while he is having his photograph taken and, yes, you can see why the eyes and the teeth did the trick every time. </p> <p>Nowadays, Sacha Distel, the man most likely to stay 25 forever, is 67. He doesn't like to talk about his age, though. Even the word is avoided, slalomed around with elegant superstition. Instead, he talks about 'the number', as if it's just a code on a bus ticket or a dry-cleaning receipt: a random, largely irrelevant figure. 'I don't feel too concerned, except that you have a number,' he says, when asked if he worries about getting old. 'I go skiing every year, and till the next time, when the snows will come back, the time goes so quick. Then you think of the number and you say, \"Another 12 times, another 15 times, and the number will be...\" and then you get frightened. So that's a thought that I'm trying not to have.' </p> <p>His figure and expensive teak burnish are maintained by regular sessions on slopes and courts; his mostly blue-black hair is all his own - and, he is at pains to point out, not dyed. 'It's just luck,' he adds, in a voice as deep as a spy sub, as rich as St Emilion au Chocolat. 'My uncle Ventura was quite fat, bald and pale. And during my childhood, my friends who saw his jazz band would say, \"Oh, you'll be fat and bald like your uncle.\" And you should see them now.' He can't help adding that when he meets 'the lady friends' of his thirtysomething sons, 'I can still see it in their eyes. It gives me a good feeling, you know.' </p> <p>We are sitting on very low-slung scarlet and gold sofas at one end of a long sitting room, papered in yellow silk. In front of us is a silver table upon which are placed, at ritualistic intervals, silver hip flasks, cigarette cases, lighters: the decorative apparatus of hedonism. (Distel has never smoked, and has only been drunk once in his life, an experience he did not enjoy. 'I always loved, since I was a child, to have things under control.') The doors on to the terrace are open to sun and birdsong, and to the intermittent murmur of tourists making their way to the Le Corbusier edifice at the end of the street. Distel has lived in this tall, narrow house for nearly 40 years. He once joked that his wife Francine, a one-time member of the Olympic ski team, married him for it. You may associate him with the south of France - in many people's memories, he will forever be the man with whom, during one amazing summer, a barefoot Brigitte Bardot rode pillion along the C&amp;'244;te d'Azur - but Distel has always been based in Paris. For the next six months, however, he will be living in a pied-\u00e0-terre in London, making his stage debut in the musical Chicago . </p> <p>'I've never done anysing like this, you know?' he says, propping himself against the cushions. 'And I love England. I was so srilled to see that everybody is interested, everybody still knows me, you know?' The fact that his character, Billy Flynn, is a hard-boiled, fast-talking Chicagoan lawyer presents no worries either. 'I think it's the first time they have a real top-of-the-bill type of name. So they won't mind about the accent.' </p> <p>No, they probably won't. Distel, who recently enraged his compatriots when he said he preferred to sing in English than French because it is 'more beautiful', has always loved England, and England - well, bits of it, anyway - has always loved him back. In France, his jazz roots were forgotten when he became a successful singer in 1959, shortly after breaking up with Bardot. To his annoyance, when he composed 'The Good Life' - later recorded by everyone from Sarah Vaughan to Frank Sinatra - his record company put it out as a B-side. The French public, used to his 'happy, novelty' songs, now had him taped as 'happy-go-lucky, the brother, the cousin'.</p> <p> In the UK, despite notching up the biggest hit of his career with the perky 'Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head', he was seen in a different light. Perhaps it says more about the British nation than one Frenchman, but when Distel tolerantly played the fall guy to Morecambe and Wise (who nicknamed him Slasher) he became 'the heart-throb, the sex symbol, whatever you call it'. Always accompanied by violins, girls singing 'Aaah!' and softly parping horns, Distel became the sound of safe continental sophistication - too safe, too smooth to attract the lint of nostalgia, though, so he's largely missed out on the easy-listening revival. Even if you can't actually remember any of his hits, you're probably able to recall the line in that old Peter Sarstedt confection 'Where Do You Go To My Lovely', in which his name is dropped, alongside those of Balmain and Juan-les-Pins, to semaphore exotic jet-settery: </p> <p> You live in a fancy apartment <br> Off the Boulevard Saint-Michel </p> <p>Where you keep your Rolling Stones records </p> <p>And a friend of Sacha Distel </p> <p>Distel is fond of his fans, mere mortals who age while he stays, more or less, the same. He tells me about Theresa, the president of his British fan club ('if I still have a fan club') whom he first met when she was eight. At their first meeting, which took place outside the London Hippodrome, following an appearance on Cilla Black's show, she was accompanied by her parents. Now she must be 45. 'Theresa. That one is very nice. She never married.' There is a pause. He thinks for a moment, head tilted to one side. 'Sometimes that's the bad thing about it. Not Theresa, but people fix themselves and that changes their lives, sometimes. You know? I'm not sure that's good. You're in their mind all the time. I'm always happy to be friendly but as the years pass by - bom-bom-bom-bom, 20 years later, 30 years later - sometimes you feel a little bit sad.' </p> <p>I ask Distel when he first realised he had it. It . You know, sex appeal. He laughs a little, ha ha ha ha, just to be modest, and then answers matter-of-factly. 'I was 13. I was very shy, in a way, as a boy. And there was a girl that I liked. And she came to me.' He explains about the verb draguer , which my Anglo-French dictionary translates as 'to dredge; to fish with a dragnet; to chat up, to try and pick up'. 'Well, I never dragged. Je ne drague pas !' </p> <p>One thing that his fans really love about Sacha Distel is his heroic family history. Leo, his father, was a White Russian who made his way to Paris after the Revolution and doggedly built up an electrical business, desperate to prove his worth to the prosperous jeweller who reluctantly became his father-in-law. Sacha was an only child. After the German invasion, his mother Andr\u00e9e, who was both Jewish and a member of the Resistance, was taken away. 'Seven o'clock in the morning, bang bang, it's the police - out.' She was sent to a camp near Paris; Leo went into hiding; and Sacha, then aged nine, was sent to a boarding school in the provinces. 'We knew she was alive. My father knew a little bit what was happening, and he would let me know what I could understand. Psst, that now is a little vague.' Two years later, against the odds, the Distels were reunited, and went back to Paris. It must have been difficult, adjusting to being a family again. No. 'I think it was even better.' </p> <p>His mother's brother, the band leader Ray Ventura, introduced Distel to music. Distel describes going round to his maternal grandparents, who lived only a few streets away from where we are now, on Sunday afternoons, 'and my uncle was there, and his friends would come, they'd write songs, it was so exciting, so fun. And my father was selling electrical supplies.' Though he studied the piano, the guitar caught his eye early on, when he took a holiday job couriering Henri Salvador, the guitarist in Ventura's jazz band, to the studio. 'He was always singing love songs, and all the ladies. I was 14, 15!' Shortly after, Distel made his amateur jazz debut. </p> <p>After military service, his uncle offered him a job in his music-publishing firm, and for a while he twinned this with performing. But then, in 1958, came Bardot, who had just made And God Created Woman. Shortly after their eight-month relationship folded, Distel launched his own singing career. People assumed that he was a gigolo with an eye on the main chance, but by then he was already an established musician (voted Best Guitarist by two French jazz mags for seven years running). In any case, he'd always wanted to sing. </p> <p>In her recent autobiography, Bardot didn't exactly mince her words. 'All of a sudden the star of the couple was him with his contracts, his musicians, his think tank, his public relations,' she wrote of her ex-fianc\u00e9. 'If only he had known at the time that his first public-relations asset was me. He didn't find out until afterwards when he had become a zero.' </p> <p>Chivalrously, Distel shrugs this off. He hasn't read the book, apart from newspaper excerpts, 'and I'll tell you why. When I met Brigitte and had a short relationship, it was very honest, very beautiful, romantic. We never see each other, but now I just want to keep this souvenir of this beautiful woman, beautiful time. And what she's become since, how she thinks now, what she looks like now, I'm not interested. What she says of what was - not concerning me but concerning people I know - is not true. So I can say that probably some of the things she says about me, and I've heard they're not really too bad, should not be [taken too seriously]. I don't want to know! It was great, I was with the most beautiful girl in the world, and that's it.' </p> <p>They last had contact in 1970, when Leo died. 'She wrote a very nice letter. She knew my father and it was beautiful, really. My thoughts about her are very nice, but I'm just happy I married the right girl after all.' </p> <p>At the moment, Francine, whom he met while skiing at Meg\u00e8ve, is at their house in the south of France. (Her mother died there the day before yesterday, a few hours after Distel had left for Paris. 'She said her mother went to swim in the pool. She went in the deep end. Down the stairs, into the water, she was swimming, and then she went: \"Oh!\" Finished. Ninety years old. Great, uh?') The marriage has been through its tricky patches - there was a nasty moment in 1985 when Distel wrapped his Porsche around a pylon in the middle of the night, damaging his eye and causing serious injuries to a soap starlet named Chantal who was in the passenger seat - but they appear to have weathered that successfully. 'Thirty-eight years in January,' muses Distel. 'I told her at the beginning, \"I'm going to marry you because you're going to be a nice little old lady.\" She hasn't turned into one yet.' </p> <p>While Distel has his photo taken upstairs, against the virulent Bridget Riley of his bedroom wallpaper, I wander into his den and admire a framed front cover of a 1963 Paris Match : 'Sacha Distel A Capitul\u00e9!' Sacha and Francine, their dark, healthy good looks thrown into definition by shaggy white fur collars, press their heads close for the camera's benefit. The den, where Distel continues to compose, is packed with memorabilia as well as clues to his current eclectic tastes (the CD collection includes Lionel Ritchie, Britney Spears and Snoop Doggy Dogg) and to his slender figure (Effidigest tablets: 'digestive stimulant and flat abdomen'). Large clip frames full of black and white photographs hang on the walls: Distel, with boater and cane, doing a tap routine with Maurice Chevalier. Distel in evening dress, chatting to Princess Margaret. Propping up the bar with Shirley MacLaine. Windswept with Tina Turner. Only Bardot is conspicuous by her absence. </p> <p>I look and I look, and then finally I find it, tucked away in a corner, next to some family snaps. The pair of them are backstage at a gala. The light is gleaming off the satin stripe on his dress trousers and Bardot's incisors, bared in a huge, hungry smile as she looks towards the camera. Distel is rapt in profile, gazing at her. No eyes, no teeth this time: he looks like a man goggling at a natural phenomenon. It must have been strange for him to get to the edge of the volcano, this white-hot celebrity, and then back off into the comparative chill of the world outside of the A-list. But Distel is philosophical. 'I thank God. What a pleasant life, you know? I'm not the richest man in the world, but I'm OK. If I want to change my car, I change my car. I don't have to count out the pennies. What else? Got such a great house here and a chalet on a mountain. It's enough, you know?'</p>",
  "<p>When a company produces a list of four excuses for its fall in profits, you can be pretty sure that either the business or its communications systems have gone a bit haywire. In Kingfisher's case, it seems to have been both. </p> <p>Despite having guided analysts forecasts down in July, and despite its house broker cutting its forecasts even further just a week ahead of the results, the 20 per cent fall in first-half profits to \u00a3204 million took the City by surprise. </p> <p>That may explain the rather abrupt departure of Kingfisher's investor relations manager. Unfortunately, however, the problems will not be solved simply by shooting the messenger. It is the performance of Comet, Woolworths and Kingfisher's other collection of businesses that is the real concern. </p> <p>Geoff Mulcahy, group chief executive, was a proponent of the idea of cutting prices to drive sales growth long before this became fashionable. </p> <p>The theory was that the extra volumes, backed by ever-falling costs, would protect margins and keep profits moving ahead. The most notable success was at B&amp;Q, which used its market leadership to build bigger and bigger stores, buy cheaper and cheaper stock, and attract more and more customers. The virtuous circle continued in the first half. Like-for-like sales grew by 8 per cent, and profits jumped 17.5 per cent, despite a 4 per cent fall in average prices. </p> <p>At Comet, where the market is more competitive and chief rival Currys is in good shape, price-cutting has had a less obvious impact. In the first half sales rose by 12.6 per cent, excluding new openings, but profits stayed flat and margins dropped. Comet has suffered from lower computer prices and the popularity of the less lucrative pay-as-you-go mobile phone services, but Mulcahy's job is to manage that for shareholders' benefit. </p> <p>At the other British chains, Superdrug and Woolworths, it has been far harder to make this pricing strategy work. Superdrug may be cheaper than Boots, but so are most supermarkets and Boots has yet to show any real pain. Woolworths' odd assortment of goods is hardly the sort shoppers do a price check on. Cutting prices at these chains risks cutting profits.That was borne out by the results at Woolworths and Superdrug, where profits fell 40 per cent despite a \u00a310m investment in 'every day low pricing'. </p> <p>Kingfisher's strategy was built not just on cutting prices in this market. Mulcahy's vision is of an international retailing group, and he is some way ahead of his peers in creating that. Unfortunately, when things go wrong in the UK, the City has a habit of searching for things going wrong elsewhere, too. Castorama, the French do-it-yourself chain, was seen as a bit disappointing and there is concern about the mounting losses at Wegert, the German electrical chain. A confused analysts' presentation did little to dispel the fears. </p> <p>Given these problems it is perhaps not surprising that Kingfisher should announce its intention to demerge Woolworths and Superdrug - demergers are increasingly used to divert attention from poor performance. </p> <p>In some respects, it makes sense. Kingfisher's shares have lagged behind the market by about 30 per cent over the past year. They are now so poorly rated that Mulcahy would find it difficult to raise funds to further his international ambitions. Shorn of the troublesome general merchandising businesses, as Woolies and Superdrug are called, the shares could recover. </p> <p>But to create value for current shareholders, the demerger should also benefit general merchandising. And despite Mulcahy's insistence that he 'passionately believes' that general merchandise is capable of 'major growth', it is not clear where that growth will come from. </p> <p>Kingfisher points to its new formats: Big W, an 85,000 sq ft 'destination store' selling a wide range of goods; Woolworths General Stores, modelled on US drugstores, and Super D, a discount toiletry chain. Together, Mulcahy believes these will add \u00a32.5 billion sales a year - as much as Superdrug and Woolworths combined. That is a tall order and, as one analyst said, there is no point adding those sales if you're not adding profits. </p> <p>Mulcahy's aim may be to attract bidders for Superdrug and Woolworths before the demerger. What is more likely, however, is that vultures will be circling B&amp;Q, Darty and Comet, particularly if, as the City fears, profits do not recover in the second half. That speculation will underpin the shares, but is not sufficient reason to buy. </p> <p><strong> Circle squared</strong><br> It would have been astounding if Blue Circle had produced disappointing results less than six months after fighting off a bid from French rival Lafarge. It duly produced a better-than-expected 14 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to \u00a3126m for the first half of the year. </p> <p>Much of what it promised during the bid battle has materialised. Malaysia has recovered strongly, turning a \u00a3600,000 loss into a \u00a315.1m profit on the back of a 32 per cent rise in volumes. Prices for cement are hardening everywhere and volumes are expected to continue to rise. Half of the promised \u00a3800m has been handed back to shareholders through a share buy-back and it has achieved \u00a311.6m of the promised \u00a3116m 'operational improvements'. </p> <p>Chief executive Rick Haythornthwaite is confident that it can achieve the remainder: the programme is not just about head office initiatives, it is going all the way through to the cement operations. </p> <p>He is equally confident that he will not have to give away the savings in lower prices to customers. The City, however, is less confident and points to the US, where there are already signs of price pressure. Haythornthwaite says these were shortlived and that roadbuilding programmes will keep US prices and volumes moving ahead. </p> <p>The comfort for shareholders is that, if he is wrong or fails to deliver on cost cuts, Lafarge is still waiting in the wings. It has a 32 per cent stake, and this could rise to 40 per cent if the remaining \u00a3400m is returned via another buy-back. </p> <p>That holding puts a floor on the shares, and it is unlikely they will fall much below 400p. It also puts a ceiling on them, at least in the short-term: the City would not expect Lafarge to pay much more than 500p a share. Buyers should not, therefore, expect too much excitement.</p>",
  "<p>Bill Gates's photographic business venture, Corbis, sparked anger among photojournalists gathered for the industry's annual festival last week in the French town of Perpignan. They were anxious about the fate of photographers working for two famous agencies bought by the company. </p> <p>News photographers working for Sygma and Saba - most of whom had verbal contracts under which the agenciestook 50 per cent and shared costs - complain that new Corbis contracts are geared more to the concerns of commercial photographers accustomed to seeing their images digitally altered - anathema in news pictures. </p> <p>Corbis, meanwhile, argues that the world of photojournalism has been changed radically by the digital revolution and that photographers are using Corbis as a whipping boy over more generalised fears about the future.Certainly the old model of independent agencies representing a limited number of photographers is fast disappearing, just as film is being replaced by digital disks. </p> <p>Agencies are being snapped up by larger corporations, notably the American group Getty Images, Hachette Filipacchi Medias of France - which this month bought the UK agencies Katz and IPG - and, most controversially, Corbis. </p> <p>Technological changes now offer faster, cheaper distribution and the promise of countless new outlets. Corbis, founded by Gates in 1990 to investigate the marriage of technology and photography, started buying old photo archives (Bill loves history), then moved on to news agencies. Within the last year Corbis bought both Sygma and the work of its 125 photographers and Saba, another high-profile independent agency. </p> <p>But quickly there was friction over the Corbis way of doing business (sell as many images as possible to as many outlets as possible), which sat badly with the creative desires of the news photographers. </p> <p>Sygma's Paris-based photographers, abetted by rigorous French laws on authors' rights, are expected to sign a rewritten contract soon. Photographers elsewhere are still waiting for a new deal. </p> <p>Steve Davis, Corbis's chief executive officer and president, says the company has a long-term plan for the industry, 'a real belief that if you could give photographers the opportunity to shoot in different ways, and you can give the marketplace a one-stop shop, that would benefit both sides'. </p> <p>However, the company's position, and its sponsorship of Visa Pour L'Image, the Perpignan festival, was undermined by the defection of several senior staff in the run-up to the festival and the resignation of several well- known photographers. Davis, in an interview at Perpignan, agreed that Corbis had made mistakes: 'There are some very unhappy clients and customers and photographers.' But he argued that Corbis is the 'flashpoint' for complaints simply because change is in the air. </p> <p>The digital revolution has transformed the work of the news photographer. It requires huge investment in new technology, and few agencies could afford to make the change without an injection of capital - which is why Marc Grosset, the widely admired owner of Rapho, has just sold to Hachette and its stable of magazines, including Paris-Match . </p> <p>However, Magnum, the famous co-operative, has rejected overtures from Corbis and Getty because of losing control over the use of images. The agency plans to finance digital operations by reducing sales percentages to members. </p> <p>Corbis, which reportedly lost $50 million last year, saw the possibility of selling to new markets and of combining different kinds of photography under one brand. Even news magazines need stock images (any decent picture of, say, Prozac), and would rather receive one invoice than several hundred. The Corbis website offers millions of images to anyone prepared to pay. But news photographers retain strong feelings for their pictures and want to retain control of the images - in effect to know they are going to a good home. </p> <p>The most successful news photographers might, under the old system, make $10,000 a month - relatively little compared to the rewards of fashion or advertising work. But photographers who are willing to spend weeks or months in a war zone, among famine victims in Africa or documenting nuclear refuse in Russia are not motivated solely by money, but by a desire to tell the story. </p> <p>Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Leroy, director of the Perpignan festival, says the present crisis mirrors those at the end of the Second World War and the 1960s, which saw the creation of Rapho, Sygma, Gamma and other agencies. </p> <p>The difference this time, 'is that nobody knows how tomorrow's agency will work. We have this huge revolution with the internet and digital photography, but I'm not sure we've found a way to use it.'</p>",
  "<p>'We're mad!' Barry Gibson, chief executive of Littlewoods, boomed on the stage of Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall. 'We're going to Make A Difference,' he exhorted 900 senior staff gathered for the catalogue and stores group's annual management conference last Wednesday. </p> <p>The occasion launched Littlewood's latest survival strategy - 'better value retailing' - to take on clothes discounters such as Matalan, New Look and Peacocks, which have hit its high street sales hard. But this year's was no happy-clappy event. With up to 300 job cuts already announced this month and heads starting to roll this week, morale among Littlewoods' staff is at rock-bottom. </p> <p>And, increasingly among senior Littlewoods' insiders and certain members of the controlling Moores family, Gibson and his chairman James Ross are seen as part of the problem, not the solution. 'Everyone is in jitters. It's a bloody mess,' one family member told The Observer last week. 'If I could, I'd change the board and change direction. We need to get profits up, but we also need to raise morale urgently.' </p> <p>Littlewoods has seen its share of ructions in the last decade, as the business has struggled to keep up. But its present straits leave the group in its worst predicament yet, say senior insiders and retail industry figures. The problems, they say, stem directly from key decisions taken since Gibson's appointment three years ago. </p> <p>'Making a difference' is just one of a plethora of initiatives launched by the 48-year-old chief executive, who joined from airports group BAA but began his working life as a Littlewoods management trainee in 1970. </p> <p>In quickfire succession, the 27,000 staff have also been left bewildered by 'back on track', 'changing with pride', 'Project Concorde' and 'Operation Spaceship' - the latter a \u00a310 million brainwave that carved up Littlewoods' 14-storey Liverpool headquarters into open-plan offices 'with ambience'. </p> <p>'Following on from the success of \"changing with pride\" and \"building on pride\" we now bring you \"consolidating with hubris\",' the firm's underground newsletter Then sniped in the summer, adding: 'You could say that means \"harsh unemployment begets a reduction in insolent sods\".' The publication is a spoof of the official staff magazine Now . </p> <p>According to senior retail sources, Littlewoods' core problems can be traced to the biggest overhaul of all - 'Project Rio' (retail integration operation). Begun 18 months ago, it aims to cut \u00a350m of annual costs by consolidating all activities - the department stores, Index catalogue shops and home shopping - as a single trading operation under the Littlewoods name. </p> <p>'Barry believed there were massive savings to be made by reinventing the brand name for everything,' one senior source said. 'The problem is that stores and mail order are completely different, with different customers, stock and credit control demands.' </p> <p>Conceived by Gibson shortly after his appointment, Rio marked yet another U-turn for Littlewoods. In 1996 a \u00a31m report from management consultancy Bain &amp; Co urged Littlewoods to focus on its catalogues, keep the profitable football pools and sell off the 135 department stores. </p> <p>This plan, also overseen by Ross, quickly fell apart. In July 1997 Littlewoods scrapped the stores sale after bids failed to top \u00a3600m. Instead, just 19 were offloaded to Marks &amp; Spencer for \u00a3192m to satisfy the family's demands for cash. A \u00a3395m bid for catalogue rival Freemans also fell foul of competition watchdogs. </p> <p>Project Rio, however, also quickly ran into trouble. Home shopping has always been Littlewoods' main driver but, following disagreements with Gibson, most of the division's top manage ment walked out. High-profile departures in the last two years have included catalogues boss Bryan Mayoh and key Index shops executives Bob Lancaster, Francis Armelin and John Allen. </p> <p>Instead of looking outside, staff from the struggling department stores filled the void. One source close to Littlewoods said: 'The chain stores people got the key positions. It was like German reunification but with the East Germans left in charge.' </p> <p>Last year home shopping profits slumped by a third to \u00a365m and - after a poor reception, too, for Littlewoods spring/summer range - sales are still suffering badly across the group. </p> <p>According to insiders, home shopping's problems have been exacerbated by a catalogue of errors at Littlewoods' huge new \u00a350m, fully automated distribution centre at Shaw, near Oldham. This aimed to cut costs by replacing five smaller centres. Two closed depots, however, have now reopened to shift stock from Shaw. And recently it has taken more than a week to fulfil catalogue orders instead of the pledged 48 hours, insiders say. </p> <p>'Shaw is stuffed full of items it can't cope with,' one source said. 'When your warehouse gets choked, costs rise as you madly move stuff around. Then you can't find things, so orders are late, customers return more things and go and shop elsewhere.' </p> <p>This weekend Gibson said Shaw's problems had been resolved by mid-August - week 15 of Littlewoods' financial year. 'We had a four-week hiatus in July,' he said. 'Normal standards were resumed by the second week of August. We aim for 95 per cent of orders in 48 hours and that was achieved.' </p> <p>But that is not the story told by recent figures leaked to The Observer . According to minutes of the group's trading committee on 30 August - for week 17 - Shaw still had stocking problems, and service levels were just 85 per cent, with only 'modest improvement' anticipated. </p> <p>Moreover, 'sales deteriorated across all core businesses' and 'were 24 per cent below budget, exacerbated by a high level of returns'. Littlewoods' store sales were 10 per cent below budget and Index store sales 13 per cent below budget. </p> <p>In home shopping, demand through Littlewoods catalogues was 'extremely disappointing, with turnover [before adjustments] 34 per cent below last year and 30 per cent below budget'. Index Extra had turnover 30 per cent below last year, 30 per cent below budget and 19 per cent below forecast. </p> <p>Retail sources say those problems will not be fixed in time for the crucial Christmas trading season. </p> <p>No wonder, then, that Gibson resorted to some unconventional motivation at the Philharmonic last week. This year the three store managers who best meet targets will win a BMW. </p> <p>'This really is desperation stuff,' one insider said. 'In 1982, when Sir John Moores made redundancies for the first time, he gave up his Rolls Royce and people in Littlewoods felt sorry for him. Now staff would happily set fire to both Barry Gibson and his chauffeur-driven car.' </p> <p><strong> Musical chairs at the hottest seat in UK retailing</strong></p> <p>Britain's biggest privately owned business has its origins in the country's first football pools operation, founded by the late Sir John Moores in 1923. Nine years later, with his brother Cecil, he launched the first Littlewoods catalogue using the football pools' vast mailing list. In 1937 the first Littlewoods department stores opened in Blackpool. </p> <p>By the Seventies the chain was flagging. Moores was Merseyside's biggest post-war benefactor, pumping millions into soccer, the arts and education, but he was also a domineering autocrat whose second son, Peter, was pushed aside as chairman for failing to live up to his exacting standards. </p> <p>In the Eighties he finally brought in professional outside management to run the empire - and then the fun started. Gibson is just the latest in a line of colourful chief executives to take the hottest seat in British retailing. The first, in 1983, was the flamboyant Sir Desmond Pitcher, a consummate soother of Moores family worries. </p> <p>In 1993 he was followed by Barry Dale, a former finance chief at London Transport, who was sacked two years later and responded with an audacious \u00a31.2 billion bid for the Moores empire. Dale was sent packing, but the affair brought to a head tensions within the family. Until his death in 1993 Moores had kept them on a tight leash. Dissent meant disinheritance and the idea of a stock market flotation was taboo. But by now there were 32 family shareholders, many with expensive tastes, notably grandson John III, who had decamped for the playboy lifestyle in Monaco. </p> <p>Dale's departure followed a controversy involving his deputy, Prodip Guha, who was also fired, a Far East supplier - Lorad - and claims that Littlewoods had been ripped off to the tune of \u00a315m. All the allegations were denied and Littlewoods later settled with Dale, Guha and Lorad's founders. But the family, who had private detectives running around the globe, felt ripped off and the Moores grandchildren pushed the flotation issue to the fore. </p> <p>In 1996, with the appointment of former Cable &amp; Wireless boss James Ross as chairman, the family agreed a 'new governance' charter. Moores' two children, John Jnr and Lady Grantchester, left the board, leaving only her son, James Suenson Taylor, as a family director. </p> <p>It is the founders' grandchildren who are most eager to cash in and, since Gibson's appointment in 1997, they have been banking on a flotation by the end of 2002 at the latest. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:paul.farrelly@observer.co.uk\">paul.farrelly@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>In case you missed it - and you probably did - last week the trade unions had their annual Congress in Glasgow. </p> <p>The mood in the Scottish Exhibition Centre was fragile - climbing peaks of optimism and reaching depths of frustration with the volatility of the world oil price. </p> <p>Brothers and sisters arrived in buoyant mood, trumpeting the increase in their membership and influence in the three-and-a-half years since Labour took power. </p> <p>'This is a week,' said TUC General Secretary John Monks on Monday, 'for us to tell the story of union success.' Events, of course, conspired to make it the worst possible week to put this story across. 'We might as well be on another planet for all anyone cares,' said one disconsolate delegate. </p> <p>But union spin-doctors earned their salaries: by Wed-nesday, Monks had condemned the 'bosses' strike', and yesterday Bill Morris of the mighty T&amp;G claimed cred-it for fixing the crisis. 'Scoop,' said the T&amp;G's eager beaver. 'He's not said that before.' </p> <p>Story or not, the real test will be whether the Government feels bound to repay favours such as this. Do the unions really have any clout beyond the conference halls where they meet each year? </p> <p>In their sunnier moods, delegates point to the minimum wage and the union recognition laws that have been delivered thanks to their lobbying - and underpinned influence and membership. But in their darker moments they concede there's a lot to do but little consensus on what it is - and whether anyone is really listening. The unions' problem, as they prepare for Labour's conference in Brighton, is to pick the right issues - those that will attract new members but no ridicule. </p> <p>Some unions have private misgivings about the campaign for the \u00a35 minimum wage - believing there's no question of it being accepted in Whitehall. A certain lack of confidence is reflected in some of the resolutions being pulled together for debate in Brighton: some are esoteric; some are fawning; others are confrontational. </p> <p>Monks accepts that the Government has gone some way towards redressing the balance between employers and workers. But he wants more 'Fairness at Work'. First, he wants protection for the pensions of workers transferred from the public to the private sector and for the pay and conditions of those who replace them. Second, he wants companies legally obliged to train their employees. Third, he wants greater rights to information and con sultation about company decisions that affect the workforce. </p> <p>Monks was uncompromising last week when he told the CBI to stop whingeing about new regulations. But the CBI has a point when it says legislation does not guarantee better training. French companies pay a levy but spend 2 per cent of employment costs on training; UK companies spend 2.7 per cent. However, quoting averages does nothing for the resilient minority of unskilled people in Britain who need to be trained. </p> <p>Britain lags behind other European countries on the rights of workers to be consulted about major issues af-fecting them. Unions believe the Government has been ob-structive to the point of plotting with Germany to build a four-strong blocking coalition against a European directive on the is-sue, which would mean a modest strengthening of rules in the UK. </p> <p>The UK government has a chance to adopt the directive with public fanfare at an EU Council of Ministers meeting in November. </p> <p>Monks promises a fundamental change in the unions' relationship with Labour if there is no agreement. </p> <p>Again the CBI is worried: it claims that such proposals amount to employees deciding company strategy. If Monks were proposing laws to put union members on company boards there might be a point. But he is not. Monks is cautious - some say too cautious. 'Fairness at Work 2' is pragmatic: not immoderate or impractical. </p> <p>Of course, ministers don't have to listen and they can take solace in the welcome emphasis these days on partnership, not strife. After all, it's inconceivable that the unions would follow the bosses back to the picket lines. </p> <p>Isn't it?</p>",
  "<p>Littlewoods, the catalogue and stores chain, has been hit by a severe sales slump which threatens a stock market flotation expected by the controlling Moores family. </p> <p>The problems, plus rock bottom staff morale, may also fuel a rebellion against the board, which is headed by chairman James Ross and chief executive Barry Gibson. </p> <p>Retail trading conditions are tough, but the Liverpool-based group has been hit harder than rivals by changes of strategy, a poor spring/ summer clothing range, catalogue warehouse chaos and the departure of key home shopping executives, senior Littlewoods' insiders say. </p> <p>Chaos at the company's main distribution centre has left catalogue customers waiting and hundreds of containers full of stock at Southampton and Liverpool Freeport, say Littlewoods' sources. </p> <p>The Moores family gathers on Thursday for its annual general meeting and the board is expected to face growing criticism once the full extent of the problems are understood. 'The business is doing very badly. The background is dreadful,' one family member said. 'If we could muster enough votes, we would get a new chair and a new chief executive to change direction.' </p> <p>Littlewoods is still owned by 32 members of the founding family, who have taken a hands-off approach since rejecting a \u00a31.2 billion bid in 1995 and appointing Ross, a former chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless, in 1996. </p> <p>The clan is riven by factions but, family sources say, 20 per cent of the shareholders are already hostile to the board. Most of the shares are now in the hands of grandchildren of founder Sir John Moores who are eager to cash in through a flotation. </p> <p>Last week Gibson denied Littlewoods had any stock market plans. Insiders confirm, however, that the family expects a flotation by the end of 2002 at the latest. </p> <p>'The grandchildren will stay on side as long as the board can point to M&amp;S and John Lewis and blame problems on the market,' one senior source said. 'But once they realise they run far deeper, the family could get a nasty shock. I think they can forget about flotation now.' </p> <p>Littlewoods' retail trading profits fell 20 per cent to \u00a3125 million in 1999/2000. However, the firm had budgeted for \u00a3168m following its new strat egy of integrating stores and catalogue operations, according to documents leaked to The Observer. </p> <p>Last week, in an effort to boost sales, Gibson launched a fresh strategy - Better Value Retailing - introducing more low-priced items to Littlewoods' stores. He also told The Observer the catalogue warehouse difficulties were resolved by the middle of last month. But further leaked documents show that the problems continued, resulting in worse service, can celled orders and discounting to boost poor sales. </p> <p>Two weeks ago, Littlewoods completed the sale of its football pools operations for \u00a3161m to local entrepreneur Trevor Hemmings, who owns Blackpool Tower. </p> <p>That marked a further reversal of a strategy adopted in 1996, which was to focus on home shopping, keep the pools but sell off the stores. A part of the proceeds, however, is likely be distributed as a sweetener to the family.</p>",
  "<b> Last Night of the Proms</b> Royal Albert Hall, London SW7/ BBC1 and 2, Radio 3 <br> <b> Tosca</b> Royal Opera House/ Covent Garden Piazza, London WC2 <br> <b> Lebrecht Live</b> Radio 3 <p> Cheered on by 40,000 promenaders in Hyde Park, as well as crowds in Birmingham, Liverpool and the Albert Hall itself, Andrew Davis piloted his final <b> Last Night of the Proms</b> after 11 years as chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The relief was that, hooting, tooting and teddy-bear waving aside, this was a musically rewarding finale. In addition, satisfying more than usually heightened audience expectation, he repeated his witty Gilbert and Sullivan take-off, first heard a few seasons ago and now part of Proms lore, in place of a traditional speech. Some of the gags and gruesome rhymes were new, but the refrain stayed the same: 'This is the very model of a modern music festival.' </p> <p>Davis's versatility - his Elgar and Strauss are as convincing as his Mozart and Messiaen - was reflected in the choice of repertoire. The Last Night always ends with an Elgar orchestration (of Parry's Jerusalem ). On this occasion it also began with one, his splashy and luxuriant version of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in C Minor. Hilary Hahn, a demurely assured 20-year-old American, made her Proms debut with a bright, clean account of Mozart's Violin Concerto in D Major, crisply accompanied by the BBCSO, who, as 'house orchestra', provides the backbone to the entire season, though the praise and attention they deserve usually gets swallowed by glamorous visiting ensembles. </p> <p>Securing the British soprano Jane Eaglen, now based in Seattle, was a coup. Now one of the finest Br\u00fcnnhildes around, her appearances in the UK are rare. Before stripping down to her Union Jack for the inevitable 'Rule, Britannia!' (with added Wagnerian ornament), she gave an enthralling account of the Final Scene from Strauss's Salome , drooling over the head of John the Baptist. </p> <p>Grainger's version of 'Camptown [or rather camped-up] Races', full of highly operatic doo-dahing by Ann Murray, Robert Tear and others, also showed off the soloists of the BBCSO. Another witty diversion was the premiere of Gerard McBurney's reconstruction of Shostakovich's Jazz Suite No 2. McBurney, who also gave this year's evangelical Proms lecture on Shostakovich, came across the rough sketches two years ago. The result is a brief, three-movement suite, saltily scored for a small ensemble including banjos, guitars, multiple saxophones and vamping piano. </p> <p>Out in Hyde Park, the Proms in the Park had its own competitive attractions, namely Angela Gheorgiu who sang a charming, soft-centred ballad by her husband, Roberto Alagna. Four days later, she was spotted at another People's Event, enthroned in the stalls of the Royal Opera House for <b> Tosca</b> , which was also relayed live on a screen to the piazza. With suspicious serendipity typical of international superstar timing, Alagna was singing Cavaradossi. He jacked up the excitement in a riveting performance by hanging on to high notes justa jot longer than musically necessary, eliciting audience whoops mid-aria. The breath control was amazing but more suited to Annie Get Your Gun than to Puccini. That he occasionally had to climb effortfully to these vocal peaks made the experience more questionable. </p> <p>Yet his talent has always been to awaken sympathy. Here, his anguish in the face of torture and death was entirely credible. As Tosca, Catherine Malfitano, showed all the compassion, subtlety and expressive powers this role requires, but which few bring. Anthony Michaels-Moore relished Scarpi's cold, smiling lasciviousness. The much revived, Franco Zeffirelli staging, first seen in 1964 with Maria Callas as Tosca, still makes an impact, in an old fashioned sort of way - as long as you don't see it too often. Carlo Rizzi's conducting was well-paced and thoughtful, and the ROH orchestra responded in style. </p> <p>Standing outside in the piazza, appropriately, for the last act - which itself takes place under the stars - the audience experience was entirely different but no less intense. Directed as if for television, with close-ups and long-shots, the over-emphatic gestures required for opera seemed in this context to have been borrowed from silent film. Thus Alagna with full-screen face set in a grimace, dripping blood and sweat, arms akimbo, caused brief discomfiture. Once he began to sing, any embarrassment quickly vanished. The sound was good, the image slightly grainy and mysterious but adequate, the crowd attentive. When the caviare is as well-served to the general as here, spirits are lifted, opera demystified and converts made. </p> <p>The week's third democratic offering (lively dictatorial elements notwithstanding) was a daring new Radio 3 programme, <b> Lebrecht Live</b> . This fortnightly unscripted debate presented by Norman Lebrecht lives on its nerve, inviting audiences to participate by phone and email on a topic, this week whether we're being served by those who put on concerts and opera. It had a heady urgency, like a cultural Moral Maze on speed. </p> <p>The test will be to keep up the pace yet still allow arguments to develop. Studio guests such as John Tusa responded sagely to an exhaustingly swift succession of queries on everything from programme starting times (7pm, please) to whether concerts should really take place in swimming pools and railway stations (seriously) instead of stuffy old concert halls. Such a grim prospect suddenly makes the Barbican look decidedly cosy.</p>",
  "<p><strong> O Brother, Where Art Thou?</strong> (106 mins, 12) Directed by Joel Coen; starring George Clooney, Holly Hunter, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson </p> <p> Invariably, some literary or cinematic source quirkily lurks beneath the original screenplays of the Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel. Miller's Crossing , for instance, is a conflation of Dashiel Hammett's The Glass Key and Red Harvest ; the central character of Barton Fink is based on playwright Clifford Odets and the film's plot derives from Deadline at Dawn , a movie Odets scripted in 1946; their previous film, The Big Lebowski , reworks Chandler's The Big Sleep . </p> <p>Their new movie, O Brother, Where Art Thou? has several sources which are part of the film's meaning. On the surface, it's a picaresque comedy set in the Deep South in 1937 and stars George Clooney, John Tur turro and Tim Blake Nelson as three convicts who escape from a Mississippi chain- gang. Clooney is the charming, loquacious shyster-lawyer Everett, with a Clark Gable moustache and the kind of flat cap and bib-front overalls Henry Fonda wore in The Grapes of Wrath . Turturro is Pete, a surly redneck with a mean streak. Nelson is kind-hearted Delmar, the simple-minded hick. They're a splendid comic trio. </p> <p>Everett has smart-talked them into joining his quest to find the loot he's allegedly buried beneath a shack that will in four days time be submerged to create a dam. His real purpose, however, is to reach his ex-wife Penny (Holly Hunter) before she re-marries. </p> <p>Along the way, they meet a black musician and cut a gramophone record at a remote radio station run by a blind manager. This blue-grass song makes them accidental radio stars, and they get involved in the re-election campaign of a corrupt state governor (Charles Durning), who's being challenged by an equally corrupt racist. As photographed by British cinematographer Roger Deakins, the bleached summer landscapes look a treat. </p> <p>But the film announces at the start that it's based on The Odyssey and is prefaced by the opening lines of Robert Fitzgerald's translation: 'Sing in me, Muse, and through me tell the story of that man skilled in all ways of contending, the wanderer.' </p> <p>Like Joyce's Ulysses , O Brother is a mock epic with a somewhat shorter time span than Homer's, and the classical allusions are fairly jocular. The Clooney character's full name is Ulysses Everett McGill; his wife Penny is, of course, Penelope, and on their journey the convicts meet a variety of Homeric figures. A blind railroad worker warning of trouble with cows is presumably Tiresias; the lotus eaters are Baptists having their past obliterated by full immersion in a swamp; three sirens lure the travellers and appear to destroy Pete; the Cyclops turns up as a massive, one-eyed preacher (John Goodman), who first robs them and is later confronted at a nocturnal Ku Klux Klan rally, a brilliantly choreographed sequence that moves from funny to frightening to fantastic. </p> <p>In addition to Homer, the film wittily invokes twentieth-century American legends. Tommy Johnson, the musician the wanderers play with, is based on Robert Johnson, the black blues composer who allegedly sold his soul to the Devil. While being pursued by the police, they're given a lift by a manic-depressive Baby Face Nelson, the gun-happy gangster who succeeded Dillinger as the FBI's Public Enemy Number One, though in fact (not that this is important) Nelson had been dead three years by 1937. </p> <p>Hovering quietly ready for the film's climax is the epic of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Roosevelt's project to transform the rural South by providing cheap electricity, an event celebrated by grandiose poetic documentaries sponsored by the New Deal. </p> <p>Most significantly, however, the Coens celebrate the ideas and films of the great Preston Sturges, who after a decade writing screenplays emerged as the writer-direc tor of the political satire The Great McGinty in 1940. </p> <p>The surname of their protagonist, McGill, is presumably intended to echo that of Sturges's anti-hero, McGinty, who threw in his lot with crooked politicians the way Clooney does. But a more important reference is to Sturges's dazzling meditation on his craft, Sullivan's Travels , in which a successful comedy director demands that he be allowed to make a film that 'teaches a moral lesson, has social insight'. </p> <p>Sullivan's film is to be called Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? , but his exploratory odyssey through Depression America, which gets him sent to jail and put on a chain gang, convinces him that he's better employed combating human misery by making people laugh. </p> <p>Moreover, Sullivan concludes: 'I never will have suffered enough to make Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? Besides it's already been done, they made it a couple of thousand years ago and I don't believe in remakes.' </p> <p>Was Sullivan thinking of Homer when he said that? And are the Coens engaged in the delightfully postmodern activity of remaking a famous movie that never existed?</p>",
  "People who have never seen a Chekhov play think they know what they're about to receive. As children's TV comics Trevor and Simon used to intone, 'Mr Gloom is in the room'. Even the Gershwin brothers - sons of St Petersburg \u00e9migr\u00e9s, so they should know - managed to put the boot in: 'With love to lead the way/ I've found more clouds of grey/ Than any Russian play could guarantee.' <p>It's all Stanislavsky's fault. He took one look at The Cherry Orchard and proceeded to direct it as a tragedy. Chekhov was appalled. While writing it he had written to Stanislavsky's wife making it clear that it was 'a comedy, not a drama - even a farce in spots'. Ever since the infamous ensuing row, directors have ricocheted between presenting his masterpiece as a comically absurd dissection of a dying generation unable to face the shock of the new, or the moving tragedy of a bankrupt fin-de-si\u00e8cle family. </p> <p>Truth to tell, it's both - and that's the key to its greatness. First staged in 1904, it is simultaneously a naturalistic portrait of a family and its fortunes, and aprescient drama about social change. The play's unusually rich range of viable interpretations is one reason why it attracts the likes of Trevor Nunn and the Redgraves. That said, none of them has exactly specialised in Chekhov. </p> <p>'For a long time I didn't appreciate him,' admits Vanessa Redgrave in a break from rehearsals for Nunn's production at the National Theatre where he is currently artistic director. 'I couldn't understand why, but I just found it too gentle, too elegiac, too nostalgic. I preferred Ibsen because it was harder and more savage. But when I played Arkadina in The Seagull in 1985 I discovered a capacity I hadn't found in a playwright before, of taking you inside the anatomy of human beings with all their different states of mind, above all into the \"opposites\" which go on inside people.' </p> <p>Such psychological acuity is hardly surprising considering that Chekhov had a day job as a doctor. Yet the strength of the writing - and the reason why actors so love his work - is that he never simply diagnoses or judges his characters. Lesser writers build personalities with characteristics designed to illustrate a position or viewpoint. Chekhov's characters may often symbolise ideas but they also vibrate with contradiction. They are opaque, which makes watching Chekhov an extraordinary act of complicity as we're forced to make our own decisions about his characters, rather than just passively soaking up a rigged argument with pre-ordained goodies and baddies. </p> <p>Vanessa recalls doing Three Sisters with her sister Lynn and Corin's daughter Jemma. 'The director Robert Sturua told us if we didn't make everybody in the audience think of their own lives and what they were doing with them - and maybe feeling quite uncomfortable about that - then we would have failed.' Corin chips in immediately with his recollection of seeing the production in Guildford. 'I came out behind two ladies who'd obviously enjoyed it and one said to the other, \"It's so like life\", and the other retorted, \"I hope not!\"' </p> <p>Brother and sister bat ideas and anecdotes back and forth with more than polite ease, which augurs well as Nunn has indeed cast them as brother and sister. Isn't that dangerously close to being a gimmick? In Chekhov, the truism about there being no small parts is, for once, true. The Cherry Orchard has a cast of 12 named characters, every one of whom could conceive of themselves as the lead at certain moments, and who will have spent at least part of seven rehearsal weeks learning to project family connection. </p> <p>Nunn demurs at the suggestion of sentimental casting. He first worked with Vanessa on Heartbreak House eight years ago and, perhaps encouraged by Shaw's subtitle, 'A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes', suggested they do The Cherry Orchard together. Only now have circumstances and commitments allowed their diaries to coincide. Casting her alongside another member of the clan may have grabbed headlines but Corin and Nunn have been friends since being students together. Most recently, Nunn cast him very effectively in Not About Nightingales , a forgotten Tennessee Williams social drama about a prison riot which Vanessa unearthed and Nunn staged at the National and in New York. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Nunn is alive to potential charges of nepotism which also arise whenever he casts his wife, Imogen Stubbs. 'There's a general sense that it smells wrong,' he observes, a shade ruefully. 'Imogen feels it more than I do, I think. There are two occasions where she's turned down roles with me here for that reason.' Ultimately, however, Nunn regards the sibling element of the Redgrave casting as a bonus. 'It has never come up in rehearsal. We never did improvisations about their real childhood together.' </p> <p>'Casting directors assume too much similarity in families,' observes Corin, warily. Certainly, these two are interdependent but temperamentally miles apart. Rehearsals for No\u00ebl Coward's Song at Twilight in which they played ex-lovers were tempestuous to say the least, one screaming match in particular emptying the room. Even in gentle conversation, their differences are evident. Corin, the 61-year-old younger brother, is naturally circumspect and thoughtful. He leans back, tilting his head to one side, carefully considering his responses. Two years older, Vanessa is more spontaneous and volatile, pouncing on ideas with almost alarming zest. When her energy flags, you can actually see the light go out from behind her eyes. </p> <p>Those characteristics define their acting. Over the last few years, Corin has emerged from behind his sisters' shadows by harnessing his growing physical gravitas to that very quality of careful consideration. The results, in roles as diverse as Roger Casement or Sir Walter in the film of Persuasion , have been seriously powerful. Vanessa's power, on the other hand, springs from her immediacy, which, on film, the camera absolutely laps up. On stage, at her best, there's seemingly no distance between her, the writer's ideas and the audience. She somehow fuses all three elements and transmits pure, inescapable energy. </p> <p> <b> SO IT'S ALL</b> the more exciting that Nunn is staging the play in the intimate, 300-seat Cottesloe with no distancing proscenium arch and the audience seated on three sides. It's a ploy he used in his spellbinding RSC production of Three Sisters in the late Seventies. The company toured a three-sided platform for community centres and halls without raked seating. That, in turn, dictated the style. Furniture would have blocked audience sightlines so a famously naturalistic play was staged almost without props, a style which Nunn believes chimed perfectly with the Russian view of Chekhov as primarily a poet. </p> <p>He's revisiting that but with a difference because in The Cherry Orchard physical presence - and absence - are crucially important. Two of the play's most vital characters are never seen - Ranyevskaya's lover in Paris, and her son who drowned - while, conversely, the house and the orchard have enormous significance. </p> <p>That crucial symbolic strain runs in tandem with Chekhov's argument for naturalism. 'In real life,' he wrote, 'people don't spend every minute shooting each other, hanging themselves, making confessions of love. They don't spend all the time saying clever things, they're occupied with eating, drinking, flirting, and talking nonsense. These are the things which ought to be shown on the stage. A play should be written in which people arrive, go away, have dinner, talk about the weather, play cards. Life must be exactly as it is and people as they are.' </p> <p>If The Cherry Orchard were a film it would be classified as an 'inaction movie', but if the activity is mundane, the inconsequential dialogue masks a subtext of conflicting hopes and passions. Furthermore, the big ideas that Chekhov and his characters are handling are as urgent now as ever. 'Chekhov had this constant humanist belief,' says Nunn. 'The characters talk about life \"one hundred years from now\". And here we are. And we too are on the brink of bigger changes than at any time in the last one hundred years. As the student Trofimov says, \"The road's been dug up, you can't go back\".' </p> <p>The Redgraves recently publicly countered attacks on Nunn's stewardship of the National. Nunn isn't there to hear it but, as opening night looms, they reaffirm their confidence. Corin cites Arthur Miller as a defence witness. 'When he was being produced here but not in America, he said: \"By all means criticise the National, criticise the RSC and the Royal Court, but please remember that subsidised theatre is the most important thing you have. Should you ever lose it, you'll realise what you had and it will all be too late\".' </p> <p>To reverse the tide of criticism, Nunn has to encourage more first-rate work throughout the repertoire. Directing a play of this calibre with as strong a cast as this will help, but the strain is beginning to tell. As I leave, he says, 'The one thing we didn't talk about was just what a treat this is. Working on Chekhov is about the best fun you can have in the theatre.' He frowns. 'The trouble is, people have such high expectations_ that's the one thing I don't enjoy.' </p> <p>\u0095 The Cherry Orchard opens at the Cottesloe, London SE1 (020 7452 3000) on Thursday</p>",
  "<p>In a last desperate throw of the dice, Warwickshire, who had had the better of this match until rain intervened to wash out all of Friday's play and lop off another 27 overs yesterday, made a declaration that could only be described as suicidal. They set Essex a mere 201 from 56 overs, and the home team got there with six wickets to spare, securing promotion to the first division. </p> <p>At the start of the last day of the Championship, Essex and Warwickshire were two of five Division Two counties scrapping for two remaining promotion places. Of the two, Essex were better placed. In fact, had there been a countrywide wash-out yesterday, they would have gone up regardless. </p> <p>As it transpired, however, the sun shone in Bristol, where Nottingamshire and Gloucestershire not only started play on time, but sought to contrive a finish because both sides needed to win. In the circumstances, Essex and Warwickshire, kept waiting by the weather until 20 minutes after lunch, were left with no alternative but to go for a decisive outcome. </p> <p>So Essex declared 192 runs in arrears and then Warwickshire, after being forcefed eight runs from three balls, put them in again. As if the target was not generous enough, Alan Richardson bowled two wayward overs in which he conceded 16 runs in extras of every variety and at the end of three overs, Essex's requirement was reduced by 27 runs. </p> <p>Warwickshire were carrying the handicap of being able to use only four bowlers as their possible fifth, Mark Wagh, was ruled out after the umpires, John Hampshire and Barry Dudleston, had warned the captain, Neil Smith, during the first innings, that they had doubts about the legality of Wagh's action. </p> <p>Fortunately for Warwickshire, the pitch had been freshened somewhat from having sweated under the covers and enabled them to fight back. They looked likely winners after 14 overs when Essex were reduced to 64 for four. </p> <p>The swing of fortunes began in the seventh over when Paul Prichard, trying to pull Douggie Brown, put up a steepling catch to mid-on. Then Charles Dagnall, who had waited until the last fortnight of the season to get a first-team outing, struck twice in consecutive overs. </p> <p>First, David Hemp, throwing himself forward at second slip, took a brilliant one-handed catch to get rid of Dar ren Robinson, whose magnificent 92 was one of the pillars of Essex's first innings. Robinson challenged Hemp's claim for a clean catch and the umpires, after consultation, sought the verdict of the TV umpire. </p> <p>Then Paul Grayson, driving on the rise, edged a catch to Keith Piper. Worse was to follow when Stuart Law departed two overs later. Smith summoned the courage to bring back Richardson, and his third ball, a slower one pitched at yorker length, had Law leg before. </p> <p>Ronnie Irani, Essex's captain, is nothing if not a fighter. He has pulled Essex out of tighter corners and, partnered now by Stephen Peters, put the innings back on the rails.</p>",

  "<p>Have the tanks run dry for our pros on the road? With the season ending with today's games, perhaps it doesn't matter too much if they don't all make it back home. But the past few days have raised questions about county cricketers' love of the car. </p> <p>Warwickshire's men all travelled to Chelmsford by car. Likewise most of Middlesex to Cardiff, only three of them taking the train that provides a perfect connection. Many Yorkshire players, having just gone to Canterbury, motored south again to Southampton. Somerset, who do the most driving, set off by car on 5 August for a northern mission to Lancashire and Derbyshire. </p> <p>In the past, some worries have been expressed about the strain of driving and the likelihood, on the law of averages, of serious accidents. Some counties have used coaches for an extended period on the road. But it seems that the car is again king. </p> <p>Yorkshire say that a coach trip would mean some players having to drive considerable distances just to meet at Headingley. Somerset's thinking is even more hard-headed. 'What's the point of supplying players with cars and then paying for a coach?' says chief executive Peter Anderson. He does add, though, that the coaches - the human ones - want all the players together, while the players want to be free. </p> <p>Some of these arguments may be sound. Yet, somehow, cricket again manages to look out of step with other professional sports. </p> <p>\u0095 A wet summer, and Warwickshire's failure to get planning consent for permanent lights (they've decided they have no grounds for an appeal) has struck a cautionary note with other counties. It has also been noted that the games played under auxiliary lights at Edgbaston, following a spectacular introduction there three years ago, have attracted increasingly moderate crowds, indicating a big novelty factor. </p> <p>On the other hand, a day-night match can still be a big success for a county trying lights for the first time - like Northamptonshire. 'It was very, very successful,' says chief executive Steve Coverdale. 'A crowd of 5,000, and the extra corporate and sponsorship revenue, more than justifies the cost of the lights. We will probably look to do just one a year, and put a lot of marketing into it. It has to remain a novelty. And it has to be played when the nights are dry and dark - between mid-July and late August - so that it really is floodlit cricket.' </p> <p>\u0095 So great are the latest changes in the laws - which come into effect here next summer - that the Association of Umpires and Scorers have called all their senior instructors to a meeting at Keele University on 7 and 8 October. They'll then spread the word in regional seminars. Despite previous law revisions - the last major one was in 1980 - none of these is thought to have prompted such a reaction. The most radical changes, of course, concern the 'Fair Play' law, especially the possibility of awarding five penalty runs. 'The thinking,' says a leading official, 'is that this will be a deterrent that won't be used much.' </p> <p>\u0095 The meorabilia website set up earlier this summer by Charles Colville, sportsmemo.com has at last had a success with the sale of a Martin Speight painting - of the Arundel ground - for \u00a33,500. Still awaiting a buyer, however, are the two John Emburey blazers and a tie from the rebel tours to South Africa in 1982 and 1990.</p>",
  "<p>Tomorrow the selectors will announce the England A touring party that will be competing in the Caribbean's Busta Cup in the new year. Their deliberations may well take longer than when they were picking the senior sides. That process was a breeze: just one or two contentious decisions and probably no more than 20 names on the list. For the A side it's possible to pluck out many more especially since the selectors are in this case permitted the odd quirky choice dependent more on a hunch than a weight of runs or wickets. </p> <p>The expedition to the Caribbean should be an interesting one. One of the criticisms of recent A tours has been that too often the opposition have either been a) uninterested or b) sub-standard or occasionally both. Hence it has been difficult to gauge the worth of the performances of our youngsters overseas. The A team have not lost a first class match for six years. At least the cricket should be competitive this winter as they take on all the Caribbean countries in a series of six four-day matches. To top that league would be a major achievement. </p> <p>First the policy must be decided. If the A team were to represent England's second XI then the likes of Peter Bowler, Mark Ramprakash, Martin Bicknell and Ali Brown should all be included. There doesn't seem much point in that, however. The selectors must surely pick players whom they think can play for England within the next five years, not those who might have done in the last five. The one exception might be the captain. </p> <p>Last year the admirable Mark Alleyne did a fine job, but he has his duties with England's one-day squad and is therefore unavailable. A flick through the current county captains opens up two possibilities. Adam Hollioake captained the A side five years ago in Australia. He's unlikely to play for England again (though he must be above brother Ben in the pecking order at the moment), but in Championship cricket he has over seen the best, if not the most popular, side on the county circuit for the last two years and that must count for something. </p> <p>The other candidate is Lancashire's John Crawley, who has a much better chance of playing for England again and who has done a sound job since taking over the captaincy of Lancashire. In both cases the selectors had better check that these two are keen on the job. Crawley, in particular, has not always been the most enthusiastic of tourists. </p> <p>The conditions in the West Indies should influence the balance of the tour party. Even though the Caribbean has been the cradle of pace in recent times, the spinners tend to do a lot of bowling in domestic cricket so it would not be absurd to take three on tour. The other caveat about cricket in the Caribbean has been the decline in the standard of their pitches (the Kensington Oval in Barbados being the exception) but I don't suppose they can be much worse than some of ours; nowadays at Worcester, once a haven for stroke-makers, you are fortunate to see cricket on the third day. </p> <p>The greatest head scratching will occur when choosing the opening batsmen. With the elevation of Marcus Trescothick there do not seem to be many good young ones around. The greatest confusion will be when the name of MJ Powell is announced. There are three playing county cricket; two of them, both named Michael, are strong candidates for the A tour. Glamor gan's Powell has obvious ability, though has not had been as productive this season as he was in 1999. Warwickshire's Powell has been in the runs and usually opens the batting. Northamptonshire's Powell (Mark), though promising, will board the plane only if there has been an administrative cock-up. </p> <p>The Powells would be newcomers to representative cricket; so might Mike Smethurst and Gary Keedy, who have both impressed for Lancashire this summer. Curiously there is no one from the Yorkshire pace battery in this squad since Ryan Sidebottom is so frequently injured and Chris Silverwood is fading. Chris Read is the likeliest keeper, though the progress of Essex's Jamie Foster is worth monitoring. </p> <p><strong>Possible A squad</strong></p> <p><strong> John Crawley</strong> (Lancs, captain) </p> <p><strong>Ian Ward</strong> (Surrey) </p> <p><strong> Mike Powell</strong> (Warwickshire) </p> <p><strong> David Sales</strong> (Northamptonshire) </p> <p><strong> Vikram Solanki</strong> (Worcestershire) </p> <p><strong> Aftab Habib</strong> (Leicestershire) </p> <p><strong> Mike Powell</strong> (Glamorgan)</p> <p><strong> Chris Read</strong> (Nottinghamshire) </p> <p><strong> Paul Franks</strong> (Nottinghamshire) </p> <p><strong> Chris Schofield</strong> (Lancashire) </p> <p><strong> Alex Tudor</strong> (Surrey) </p> <p><strong> Steve Harmison</strong> (Durham) </p> <p><strong> Gary Keedy</strong> (Lancashire) </p> <p><strong> Mike Smethurst</strong> (Lancashire) </p> <p><strong> Jason Brown</strong> (N'hamptonshire)</p>",
  "<p>The things they don't teach you at Football Management School - No 1: Working for Ken Bates. </p> <p>These days, the most sophisticated of European coaching courses encompass such new-age subjects as physiology and nutrition but appear to contain little tuition about handling whimsical, over-demanding owners, presidents or chairmen. There is a glaring gap in the market and you can almost picture the ad in the educational supplements now: </p> <p> The University of Fairlop (UNFAIR) is pleased to offer a five-year degree in the art and science of political manoeuvring and machinations within a football club, with a view to keeping one's job. Students will be expected to have thick skins but may experience thinning hair. </p> <p>Who knows, perhaps the Chelsea chairman could offer his services as visiting tutor emeritus? </p> <p>It was the week when English football finally went crazy - make that the week when its craziness was confirmed - with the sacking of a manager for being successful. All over this country now, managers are ashen-faced at the prospect of winning the FA Cup. After all, such a piffling pot no longer seems good enough for a club who until three years ago went 27 years without a major trophy. </p> <p>Gianluca Vialli - the overseer of five trophies in two-and-a-half years in fact - got Chelsea's boot because they wanted a 'change of direction', according to their managing director, Colin Hutchinson. He and Mr Bates (who shows that you do keep a dog and bark yourself) could get their wish. After all, new coach Claudio Ranieri walked out on Atletico Madrid after leading them towards relegation. </p> <p>I once put it to Mr Hutchinson that his club aspired to be the Manchester United of the South. He bridled at the suggestion. It is clear, though, that is exactly what they want to be. Simply, Chelsea see United heading into the distance to championships and European Cups and they want it - and they want it now. The impatience has blinded them to several significant factors, though. </p> <p>First, that United stuck with Sir Alex Ferguson for four years before he won a trophy, and then it was the FA Cup. Under him, United also had a near-miss before their first title for 26 years. In addition, Sir Alex put his imprint on the club by being allowed to ship out troublemakers. </p> <p>It is said that at Chelsea, Vialli had lost the confidence of some players. A manager always loses the confidence of those he leaves out and it was inevitable with so many talents assembled at the Stamford Bridge Import House buy-and-bring sale. It must make being the director of Chelsea's youth academy one of the least rewarding jobs in the world, but is no reason for a sacking. </p> <p>Imagine, for example, word coming out of Old Trafford that Sir Alex had 'lost' some of his players. Didier Deschamps described Vialli as not the man he had liked so much as a player, but do we believe that all Sir Alex's players like him? One suspects that when he has gone the players he made so successful will talk of respect rather than affection. </p> <p>Pretentious, nous? Chelsea most certainly are. 'We are a continental club playing football in England,' said Mr Hutchinson this week. The thought occurred after their narrow victory over St Gallen in the Uefa Cup last Thursday that if they are not careful, in 11 days time they could be an English club not playing football on the continent. </p> <p>Take their attendances. Just over 18,000 against the Swiss. Petrol problems? Almost 63,000 descended from Cornwall and Essex on Old Trafford the night before and would have done so had St Albans been the opposition. One recalls before the 1994 FA Cup final, Mr Bates complaining about Chelsea's ticket allocation a few days before they attracted fewer than 9,000 for a home game against Coventry City. </p> <p>Deflating the grandiosity of the club is irresistible sometimes, as is poking fun at the most recent quotes. 'The players don't know whether they are coming or going,' said the co-caretaker coach Ray Wilkins. Well, some of them can take it from this admittedly removed source that they will definitely be going. </p> <p>The fact is that Chelsea, despite the dignity of such as Vialli and Wilkins and some kindly employees in the press room, are a charmless club with an image problem. And that comes from the top, as a week that has stretched their credibility has shown. </p> <p>The location of Chelsea's press box behind visiting fans who naturally want to stand up and thus obscure the view - technically in breach of the law although nothing is done - matters not to the public. But Chelsea should not then complain that the press get things wrong. </p> <p>Or do they? Consider last season. Chelsea denied that an incident occurred in the tunnel after the Wimbledon match, which was presumably why the FA charged both clubs. And, no, it was untrue that Deschamps would leave at the end of the season, unhappy as he was. </p> <p>As we do in the press, though, Vialli undoubtedly got some things wrong. The rotation system has fermented discontent, comparing unfavourably with Sir Alex's policy of not tinkering with key positions and fielding his strongest team for the biggest games. </p> <p>It was probably Vialli's withdrawal of Gianfranco Zola against Arsenal 10 days ago, when he and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink were looking a promising pairing, then Zola's omission at Newcastle three days later, that hastened the manager's departure. Vialli's unwillingness to contemplate an extension to his contract may also have indicated a lack of commitment. Perhaps, too, there was a feeling that he may not be too unhappy at going, a victim of injustice, while his reputation was high. </p> <p>Hasselbaink's signing remedied Chelsea's main flaw last season, a lack of pace in attack. Vialli, however, will not get to see what might yet flower. Instead, he will get the time out of the game he confided he wanted to his friend David Platt this summer. Do not rule out Vialli now taking his Italian coaching badge and resurfacing as Juventus coach, or part-owner of Sampdoria, and bringing an also then fully qualified Platt with him. </p> <p>Some of us felt that it showed the inadequacies of the English game that an unqualified Vialli could be appointed in the first place. What a shabby episode has shown, though, is that after his trophy-winning aptitude, you wonder quite whether anything - even five years at UNFAIR - would qualify any European elder statesman, even those hardened in the political ways of Italy and Spain, to work at the Bates motel.</p>",
  "<p>The routine is familiar enough. Player goes down injured and doesn't get up, first person to appreciate the seriousness of the situation boots the ball into touch, possession is eventually returned via a tame throw-in once the injured man has received treatment. </p> <p>The crowd usually applaud at this point, in appreciation of the sportsmanship involved. If you think about it, the reason they express approval is because spectators know there is nothing in the rules that demands a player return the ball to his opponents. There is a school of thought that says possession need not be handed back if the ball was kicked out by a player anxious to secure treatment for a team-mate, and another that insists the only sporting course of action is to return the ball in every case regardless of whose player went down, but the only rule is that there are no rules - apart from the one that says the throw-in goes to the opponents of the team who touched the ball last. The fact that the team taking the throw are free to do whatever they like with the possession they have been granted is implicitly acknowledged by the ripple of applause that normally breaks around the ground. </p> <p>This is an important point, because there have been a couple of examples of normal procedure not being adhered to in recent weeks. In both cases, teams have profited by doing the unsporting thing, by retaining possession and scoring a goal directly from the throw. Both Derby County in the Premiership and Notts County in Nationwide Division Two salvaged a point from what might otherwise have been a defeat by doing so. And both Middlesbrough and Bristol Rovers, their respective opponents, are understandably miffed, to the extent where Bristol Rovers are now saying that unless referees are given firm guidelines to clear up this grey area, the whole practice will fall into disuse and football will lose one of its last vestiges of sporting etiquette as well as a useful safety mechanism. </p> <p>Of the two examples quoted above, more people are likely to be familiar with the Middlesbrough case, since it was briefly covered on that night's Match of the Day . Boro managed to leak another two goals through conventional Derby attacks, however, and (grey area turns positively murky) were almost certainly time wasting anyway, so for several reasons what happened to Bristol Rovers at the County Ground last week is a more clear-cut injustice. </p> <p>Rovers were winning 1-0 with two minutes to go. Their centre-half Steve Foster stayed down after a crunching tackle on the edge of his penalty area, at which goalkeeper Nick Culkin threw the ball out of play by a corner flag. With Foster off the field receiving treatment, Culkin then came to the edge of his area to facilitate an easy return, but having confirmed his intention to the referee County's Craig Ramage threw to a team-mate and Mark Stallard was able to equalise in the final minute with the goalkeeper sprinting to recover his position. Sharp work, undoubtedly. 'Cheating,' was the exact word Rovers manager Ian Holloway used, with perhaps a tad more justification than Bryan Robson, but what to do about it? No law had been infringed. There was no reason for the goal not to stand. </p> <p>Rovers' request for a rematch, citing the famous Arsenal-Sheffield United precedent of two years ago, was predictably pooh-poohed by both FA and Football League, although the club claim they were principally interested in clarification on the issue. 'We understood all along that there were some aspects in which the Arsenal game was unique, and that the FA would probably never have consented to that rematch had not Ars\u00e8ne Wenger generously offered it,' said Ralph Ellis, Rovers' commercial manager. 'On that subject it was noticeable that while the Notts County directors were very apologetic afterwards they stopped short of offering to play the game again, but rematch or not we feel there is a broader issue that needs tidying up.' </p> <p>This boils down to whether referees should be allowed any scope to prevent sporting behaviour - eg kicking the ball out of play - rebounding against a team. The FA, still smarting from the slap on the wrist they received from Fifa over the Arsenal rematch, claim there is no scope at all for even talking about unwritten rules. You either return the ball, which is sporting, or keep it, which is unsporting. Both alternatives are possible, and therefore permissible. The one thing you cannot do with an unwritten rule is enforce it, not unilaterally at any rate. </p> <p>Football's governing bodies normally attract criticism for ignoring problems in the hope they will go away, but this is one that just might. If many more teams adopt a cynical policy, players will soon stop kicking the ball out of play in the first place and leave it to the referee to hold up the game for injury. </p> <p>That might seem sensible, but there are occasions when the referee is too busy keeping up to notice an incident in back play, or when an injury requires immediate treatment. Bristol Rovers had a player swallow his tongue on the pitch recently, and Holloway can confirm he will continue to instruct his players to kick the ball out if they see a player in difficulty, regardless of what has just happened. 'I hope we don't get a situation where teams refuse to put the ball out of play, for the obvious reason that some injuries can be serious or even life-threatening and immediate treatment is vital,' Holloway said. 'This is not just about Bristol Rovers losing two points. This is an issue for all levels of football to consider, from the Premiership down to the Dog and Duck versus the Gasworks.' </p> <p>Pity no one wants to consider it. Even the normally upbeat Professional Footballers Association are relatively coy on the subject. 'We expect to see sporting behaviour,' the PFA's Brendan Batson said. 'In fact we have circulated all our members to that effect, but that's about as much as we can do. I think it's worth pointing out that for every example of bad sportsmanship there are hundreds of examples of sporting behaviour. I see a lot of football games, and I've never seen one of these controversies, so let's keep things in perspective. We might just have had two in a week, but I don't think we'll see too many repetitions.' </p> <p>Batson takes the old pro's view that these situations can be avoided with common sense from all concerned. It has probably occurred to most readers already that last week's unpleasantness would not have happened had the Bristol goalkeeper kicked the ball out near the half way line, or not anticipated his opponent behaving in a certain way. 'You've got to cover yourself,' Batson said. 'Most managers don't want to see throw-ins conceded near goal in any circumstances. I was always told that if I must put it out, put it out as far upfield as possible.'</p>",

  "<p>A monsoon has hit Chadwell Heath, the sky is the colour of charcoal, and a deeply tanned Paolo Di Canio scoots around West Ham's training ground sporting buttercup-tinted sunglasses. It is impossible for his outlook on life to be grey so, hey presto, he finds a way to bring in an instant rainbow. </p> <p>Scanning a compilation of Di Canio's greatest hits during his four-year stint in Britain it is necessary to take a deep breath every so often, because the list is so exhaustive. This son of the south of Italy does not comprehend the notion of doing things by halves. He does things by doubles. </p> <p>Why simply feel miffed when the manager leaves your club (in this case Tommy Burns and Celtic) when you can huff publicly, abandon training, and gallop out of town on a \u00a34.5 million transfer? Why merely get sent off when you can send a referee tumbling over (step forward Paul Alcock), provoke an 11-match ban, and go awol into the bargain? Why score a tap-in when you can caress the ball with a balletic mid-air flick to claim goal of the season? The list goes on and on. </p> <p>So regularly is he the protagonist in some operatic melodrama, it must be darned hard work being Paolo Di Canio. Hear him open his heart, watch his extravagant gesticulations, listen to his boundless enthusiasm in full flow and you realise what an irresistible life it must be. Yes, his wild temperament courts controversy, but the pros render the cons almost insignificant. 'My character made many problems for me in football but without it I wouldn't play at the top level. If I had to weigh up the positives and the negatives I have to say thank you God, or whoever, because I was lucky.' </p> <p>But surely, had he been luckier he could have enjoyed a more successful career. His spontaneous gifts would not look out of place in the colours of his country, or as a regular performer in the Champions League, or in a team capable of winning the Premiership. When ability and attitude are in perfect harmony, he can emulate Giggs, Bergkamp, Zola, Kewell - even Del Piero, Totti, Inzaghi. </p> <p>'Everybody says when they meet me I deserve to play for a bigger team,' he says, surprised that they don't feel - as he does - that West Ham inspire his very best. 'Taxi drivers say, \"Why don't you play for Man United?\" What do you mean I deserve to play for Man United? I play well here because this squad give me the opportunity. Maybe at Man United I wouldn't play so well because here I get 50 balls per game and Man United you have to share 50 balls with players like Beckham, Giggs, Scholes. Here I have the opportunity to turn the game. The team believe in me, they trust me, they give me opportunities. \"Come on Paolo!\" they tell me every time. \"Come on Paolo, you can win the game for us!\" They give me energy, power, even when I am tired.' He becomes wonderfully animated merely thinking about it. </p> <p>No topic inspires him quite like the old chestnut of referees. He's convinced they don't like him. He can't help implying that they come from the George Orwell school of all players being equal but some more equal than others. To illustrate the point he ends up dramatising a scene where he is shot in the back by a defender with a gun. 'Is that a penalty, ref?' he gasps, his dying words, before roaring with laughter at the twist when the referee books him for diving as he is carted off to the mortuary. </p> <p>'I argue with referees a lot. I do this when I don't see a fair attitude from them. Sometimes I would like to say something in a more gentle way but you have snap decisions. It's difficult to say something like an Oxford student [he pops a plum in his mouth] \"I'm sorry, why didn't you give me a penalty?\" I'm jealous of players who can say it calmly but I can't do that.' </p> <p>Even though Harry Redknapp is notoriously crafty in the transfer market, the \u00a31.7 million he negotiated to bring Di Canio to West Ham has to be his best hustle yet. Had Sheffield Wednesday not been in such a predicament such a bid would have been dismissed as laughable. There was a small element of risk for the Londoners, given they were taking on a player with so much disciplinary 'previous', but Di Canio's lavish talent, coupled with a dedicated attitude to training and to winning, obliterates risk. </p> <p>Redknapp is Di Canio's most vociferous supporter. When his showman is criticised he fumes in defence. Praise often prompts an equally prickly response, as if it bugs him that people who are so quick to castigate can suddenly take off the blinkers and admire the Italian's brilliance. </p> <p>The lifebelt West Ham threw him when he was scraping the depths touched Di Canio deeply and he consequently developed a genuine affection for them. 'Every club I gave my best but there is a special situation here at West Ham and maybe I'm giving more because they helped me when I was very down. This club gave me a big hand. So, because of this I give everything I have, all my energy, because I feel the people, the club, the shirt are part of my life now. Honestly. </p> <p>'Maybe people don't trust me when I say it but I'd prefer to score two own goals and win 3-2 than score four goals and lose 5-4. At the end of the season if we go down, I go down with the squad. That's no glory. I prefer to score 20 own goals in one season and win the cup than score 45 goals and be relegated.' West Ham's position at the foot of the table doesn't worry him because he believes in the quality around him. 'I want to tell the supporters not to panic,' he announces, 'because I'm sure we'll turn it around.' </p> <p>Sure enough to resist overtures from Chelsea last week. When the \u00a34m bid came in he met with chairman and manager and it didn't take long for all concerned to reject the offer. As Di Canio recalls: 'We said to each other: \"We are a good marriage, why do we have to divorce?\" There are no problems between us.' It might have been a different story for \u00a315m. 'I would sacrifice myself for that price because I can help the club in a different way, to get big business. </p> <p>'But \u00a34m? Not good for them, not good for me, because I have to move to a new club. We'll stay together for the rest of my career. Then we'll divorce when I can't give more energy... Or maybe I can stay at West Ham in some other way. It could be good. Not manager [he chortles] because Harry is a good manager and I don't want to replace him.' </p> <p>Anyway, he confesses, he's not sure he could supplant his joker's mentality in the dressing room with the required authority for management. 'We say in Italy to be a good manager you have to be a bit of a bastard. Fabio Capello was difficult with me because I felt he made some unfair decisions, but for me he is one of the best managers in the world. I don't have to confuse sentiment with honest opinion. He was a bit of a bastard with me but his management was fantastic. He won everything. With strong players he was ruthless.' </p> <p>Having represented a clutch of the most prestigious clubs in Italy - Lazio, Napoli, Juventus, AC Milan - Di Canio emigrated in 1996 because no big Italian club wanted him any more. It was never a case of doubting his ability, but his mentality. </p> <p>His notoriety as a hothead began years ago, when he was the match-winner in the Rome derby. Lazio were his boyhood club, the team he followed all over the country getting into occasional scrapes - 'but no knives' he's quick to point out - and having scored the goal to beat Roma for the first time in years, he was photographed celebrating with a middle finger raised in the direction of the opposition fans. A reputation was born. This, he believes, is part of the explanation for a closed door to the national team. 'In Italy they don't like it when people speak too much. We look like a democratic nation but we are not. We have to shut up. I tell people what I think. If we play crap, we play crap. Full stop. No excuses. Vialli had the same problem with Arrigo Sacchi, and Zenga the keeper was a bit crazy. They don't like that. They like you to say \"Yes, Sir\". This is not my job. </p> <p>'Everyone says to me, Paolo, why weren't you ever called up for the national squad? I don't know why, maybe I am crazy. Not because I think I am the best but I think I deserve one opportunity. Not more. One! I told everybody I don't want to play in Euro 2000 or the World Cup 2002. Just one friendly game, one training session. I don't ask for the moon.' </p> <p>At least Di Canio can talk for Italy. His passion on the field has its roots in an appalling injury suffered as a teenager. When an Achilles tendon became infected doctors told him he might not walk normally again and told him there was a risk he would lose a leg. After the operation, it took him 14 months to recover. When he became a professional footballer he vowed to give 100 per cent every day for the rest of his career. </p> <p>Football, he preaches, is not football unless there is emotion. He is staggered that the authorities are clamping down on goal celebrations. First they banned breaching the touchline to hug the fans, now stripping off a shirt is illegal. 'This is terrible,' he moans. 'Scoring is the most exciting thing in football. You live your life in football for winning, and to win you have to score. It is the most emotional time for everybody!' </p> <p>We are fortunate to have him here. Footballers with the dash, flash and magnetism capable of taking on the legacy of a Gascoigne or Cantona are rare. The question of how he feels perceived in England makes him ponder. 'Some hate me, some love me, some think I'm crazy. Sometimes I'm a very kind boy, sometimes I'm very angry.' </p> <p>There is more tranquillity in his private life. 'I am a passionate man, a strong man, but outside of football with my family I am completely different. I have two girls and they changed me spiritually. You have responsibility in your life and I understand now what it is to be a father. It looks so far away when your own father tells you how you will feel about things when you are a father. You want to go to the disco with your friends. Now I understand. </p> <p>'My parents gave me principles. My father was a brickie, but with principles. Even if I am crazy on the field this is the message I want to give to my daughters: Have respect for other people.'</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps the time has come for Ivano Bonetti, Dundee's player-manager, to call upon the services of a graduate of football's school of hard knocks to explain the harsh facts of life to his Foreign Legion. </p> <p>Otherwise, Dundee may eventually be forced to reflect in the cold light of day that skill alone does not guarantee a successful outcome. Indeed, St Johnstone provided a timely reminder for their much more gifted opponents that hard work is just as important. </p> <p>It seemed inconceivable that Dundee would fail to secure a victory, given the measure of dominance they enjoyed for the first half-hour or so. But, in the end, they found themselves hanging on grimly to share in the spoils. </p> <p>Both managers pronounced themselves reasonably satisfied at the outcome, but one was left with the suspicion that Sandy Clark, the St Johnstone manager, was entitled to feel a little more satisfied with his players' efforts, all things considered. </p> <p>This was St Johnstone's fifth draw in seven SPL fixtures and a measure of just how competitive Scotland's Premier Division can be outside the domains of Celtic and Rangers. </p> <p>But the Perth side will feel, no doubt, that had they shown a little more composure and a greater level of accuracy, they would have earned greater reward in the form of three points. </p> <p>For Dundee had to rely on the sterling services of their goalkeeper, Robert Douglas, to prevent them from suffering a defeat that would, on reflection, have been unjust when measured against the efforts of both teams over the course of 90 minutes. </p> <p>Douglas nevertheless had to be in sparkling form in the closing stages to prevent Keigan Parker and Graeme Jones from snatching a winning goal. He also had to endure an anxious moment when Steven Tweed impeded Parker on the edge of the penalty area. </p> <p>There was little doubt that the offence was committed outside the box. But a lesser referee than Mr Underhill might have been persuaded to have awarded a penalty in the face of such furious protests from the St Johnstone players. </p> <p>For all that they lacked a cutting edge, Dundee could not be condemned for failing to provide a sizeable measure of entertainment for the 5,055 spectators. Some of their play was quite delightful to watch and Fabien Caballero, one of their Argentine recruits, is indeed a most talented individual. </p> <p>Unfortunately, for Dundee, Caballero was unable to supply the necessary finishing touch to add to his tally of five goals so far. But he, more than anyone else, caused problems for St Johnstone, in the early stages at least. </p> <p>One example of Caballero's ball skills came after 13 minutes, when he outpaced the defence down the right side before shooting narrowly past the target from the tightest of angles. </p> <p>But it was indicative of Dundee's repeated failures to make more of their opportunities that St Johnstone very nearly stole ahead after 25 minutes. </p> <p>Nick Dasovic's initial shot was blocked by the defence and Jones, following up, was denied only by the quick-thinking Marco De Marchi, who cleared off the line. </p> <p>Dundee have a midweek date with their City rivals United in the first derby encounter of the season, and they will need to be more alert in front of goal if they are to add to their near-neighbours' current woes.</p>",
  "<p>The Caribbean is not for single people. Package holidays are priced on the assumption that you are going with a friend; the sunbeds are laid out in pairs and the local dance routines require a partner you know fairly well. None the less, on the first night of a two-week holiday in Antigua, I was content with my own company as I sat jetlagged in a bar in the island of Antigua. </p> <p>The sunset had turned the sky purple. My fellow holidaymakers were drunk, sunburnt and irresponsible, as portrayed in public health information films. But the illusory calm was shattered when confronted with a question I'd hear often over the next fortnight. A waitress, scoldingly slamming a gin and tonic down on my table, barked: 'What you doin' here on your own, boy?' </p> <p>My solitude was breaking the unwritten rules of the Caribbean. Signs of togetherness were all around me: couples walking arm in arm; couples dribbling into each other's frozen cocktails; couples rowing over who had eaten the last olive from the bowl on the bar. But with 'you got mail' noises still ringing in my ears, a packet of duty-free cigarettes was more than enough company. Solitude was a good thing. I had booked a last-minute package holiday, intent on meeting complete strangers whom I would never see again and, of course, to see something of the island. </p> <p>The level of romance in Antigua can begin to feel like a conspiracy after a while: the island is a popular wedding destination for Americans. The resorts are packed with the bride, groom and their respective families and friends. The ceremonies occur on small podiums on the edge of the shore - the groom putting a lavish tux over his beach shorts for a few hours. This atmosphere of connubial bliss can be contagious so, in order to keep yourself from evolving into a couple, observe a few simple maxims. Never spend more than one evening with the same group of people. Ensure your arms are long enough to apply sun cream to the farthest reaches of your back. When you find yourself trying to light the wrong end of your cigarette, go home. </p> <p>I paid approximately \u00a3600 to hire a showy Jeep for 14 days and was able to escape the world of lazy resorts into a densely vegetated, playful island. The courtesy bus from the airport had shown glimpses of Antigua several decades of development distant from the holiday resorts. People carried their water from the taps in the street while corrugated iron was an integral part of each village, as indeed were cricket and stray dogs. But once you enter the resort gates, Antigua is a world where golf buggies whirr between villas, where the poolside concrete is sticky with the half-dried remnants of spilled fruit purees, and one of the bars serves pizza all day long. The Jolly Beach Resort, where I stayed for a fortnight, has just about everything a holidaying suburbanite could want, bar an uncensored experience of Antigua. </p> <p>St John's, the island's shambolic capital, wears the island's penury better than you might expect. Down on the dock the cruise ships find a bay so their passengers may mill around the cigar and trinket boutiques before departing again. There is little nightlife here, and few restaurants. It is a quiet, dozy town. Typical of the disorder, the kerbs are built high enough to control the small floods of the rainy season, but are often ineffectual because of the litter piled across the drain grilles. Here the pace of life is slow and harmless and atrocities such as a 'Man badly scratched in casino brawl' are headlined in the island's newspaper. The police appear to carry firearms more as a counterbalance to the handcuffs on the other side of their belt, rather than because of any real danger. The closest I came to feeling uncomfortable was on driving south of the island to a residential area. Following a noise down a back street I discovered a half-built house that had been adapted as a nightclub. The bass notes from the music could be felt in the Jeep. My sunburnt skin and shorts identified me and aware of the stares I was attracting I felt unwelcome and drove on. </p> <p>On the road to the island's most heavily colonised nightspot, Shirley Heights, is the Old English Harbour. Long, gold-trimmed boats line the docks, toys of those we know must be rich. On the docks the Southern Cross restaurant with its crisp linen and maritime decor offers a view of the harbour, but much of the menu I and my companions tried was shrivelled and salty. Go there for their goldfish-bowl gin and tonics and fancy bread, then get someone else to drive you back to the new restaurant at the Jolly Beach resort. There the lobster is tender and fresh, and the Sancerre worth the price tag. </p> <p>Sundays are a day of rest, church and cricket for much of Antigua. In the resorts, life is as slow as every other day, but the evenings find a dynamism of their own on one of the highest hills on the island. Shirley Heights was formerly a colonial gun post, but now a steel band and reggae group enliven the bar once a week. From 6pm onwards a crowd bearing camcorders, homemade cigarettes and cans of Red Stripe gathers. To the left, the former British colony of Monserrat puffs ash into the sky, and to the right, planes carrying British and American tourists come in to land. </p> <p>The steel band and reggae groups play until around 10pm. The music is stereotypical Caribbean, but most aficionados seem satisfied. The sounds are loud, libidinous and loose. By the end of the evening, you may find yourself caught up in the music with somebody with whom you are not as familiar as your dance suggests. And then you can say that, for a moment at least, you obeyed the rules of the Caribbean.</p>",
  "John Swinney is neat, moderate, prudent, rational. This is no Braveheart wearing his heart on a tartan sleeve. But in his own way he promises to fight for Scottish independence. <p>Unless there is an enormous upset, he seems certain to be acclaimed leader of the SNP in succession to Alex Salmond at the party conference in Inverness on Saturday. </p> <p>Swinney, 36, is a gradualist. He hopes to achieve independence by building the trust of the Scottish people both in its new Parliament and in his party. And, perhaps conscious of Salmond's reputation as a 'one-man band', he promises to build a broad-based team to carry out the task. </p> <p>Between him and his rival for the leadership, Alex Neil, 49, there is not much ideological ground. Both subscribe to the centre-left consensus in which, Swinney says, the SNP is firmly anchored. </p> <p>But on strategy there is an enormous gulf. Neil dismisses devolution as a Unionist honey trap designed to suck the SNP into acquiescence with the Union; Swinney believes it opens the road to independence. Swinney explains: 'I find it inconceivable to see how independence could be built out of the failure of the Scottish Parliament. I just can't see how that would happen. What we have to do is build on the foundations that have been laid.' </p> <p>He recognises that the Parliament is an incomplete institution, with limited powers, and that in its first year it got off to a very bad start. The early rows about holidays and commemorative medals were 'disastrous'. But still he believes that the Parliament was the 'biggest mistake the Unionists have made'. </p> <p>He explains: 'It signalled to me an admission of failure for the United Kingdom. If the UK was a great success for Scotland, we wouldn't need this Parliament. From my perspective as a Scottish Nationalist, that's a great shot in the arm.' </p> <p>Swinney asserts that the existence of the Parliament has carried the whole debate about independence much further forward and given the SNP, the main party of opposition, a much higher profile. </p> <p>'The public can now see an institution that could have a whole range of powers added to it - fiscal powers, direct representation in Europe, control over social security and macroeconomic policy. They can see how all that could come together within an independent Scottish Parliament.' </p> <p>But he admits that there is a serious problem in the public's perception of the new Parliament, because it is confusing the 'fiascos' of the Executive - run by the ruling Labour/Lib Dem coalition - with those of the Parliament itself. 'That is a distinction we're going to make time after time after time, to make sure the Parliament does not pay the price of the Executive's failures.' </p> <p>He believes that the Scottish Parliament has done some very good work in its committees and has flexed its muscles once or twice. 'But what I think is corrosive is the coalition Executive's determination to run this place just like Westminster.' </p> <p>One of his frustrations as a Westminster MP (for South Tayside) was that he didn't feel the power of argument ever won the day. 'I'm beginning to get the same feeling here, and that's very frustrating. That's not what the people of Scotland voted for - they voted for the arguments to win the day.' </p> <p>One of the weak points of the Parliament, he adds, is that it is run by a majority Executive which is a 'fix, not a genuine meeting of minds'. </p> <p>The Lib Dems will 'pay a hell of a price and the people who'll pay it will be their Westminster MPs. They have lost a great deal of support. By and large they have always been respected as people who set out their views, but here they've just tumbled over. It's not just what they've gone along with, but how they've done that.' </p> <p>Labour, too, he believes, is vulnerable to the SNP. 'There are a number of questions to be asked about what Scottish Labour MPs actually do. Are they really standing up for Scotland? Where have they been on the fuel tax issue? Where are the queues of Labour MPs standing up saying this is unjust, unfair and punitive taxation? There's a deafening silence'. </p> <p>And is there any longer a role for the Secretary of State for Scotland, who represents the Scottish interest in Cabinet? 'No. I cannot imagine what he does with his time. And I have no idea what the Minister of State [Brian Wilson] does with his time either.' </p> <p>He acknowledges that the fuel crisis showed just how inter-dependent the world has become. What place for nationalism then? 'It's just as important as ever it was'. </p> <p>The SNP believes in the sovereign right of the Scottish people to make choices - for example, about whether they want to be part of the European Union. He is an enthusiast for the euro, which he believes would produce more suitable conditions for the Scottish economy than present policies determined by conditions in the South-East. But he is against tax harmonisation because this would lead to a European superstate, which he opposes. </p> <p>Swinney grew up in Edinburgh and became attracted to the SNP as a schoolboy during the heady second general election of 1974 when it won 30 per cent of the vote and 11 seats. He remembers his profound irritation when commentators described the swimmer David Wilkie as British when he triumphed at the Commonwealth Games but Scottish when he did not. He joined the party after being 'gutted' by the failure of the 1979 referendum to produce home rule. </p> <p>He is known as a consensualist and is liked by most of his political opponents. But he insists he is no soft touch. 'I'd be concerned if my opponents didn't think I was a nice person, a courteous person. But I fight very, very hard for my politics. I'm proud of my reputation as someone who can build consensus, because I think that's what the SNP needs. It needs somebody who can bring people together very effectively.' </p> <p>He continues: 'I'm determined to bring in a range of people clearly seen as representing the SNP. If I have one ambition about the SNP leadership, it is that I preside over a team of very well known people who are trusted and viewed as credible individuals to lead Scotland to independence.' </p> <p>During the campaign he has, he reckons, talked to more than 2,500 party members. He is 'working very hard to win' but is taking nothing for granted. And one senses that, despite his talk of a broad-based leadership, he does not in any sense intend to make it a collective. Swinney means to take charge. </p> <p>He says: 'If I am elected I want everyone in the SNP to move ahead together and with a clean slate. There will be no question of me presiding over an exclusive leadership. One of my strengths is in building a team. I am all for open debate about issues within the SNP, but once we have come to our conclusions, we must speak with one clear voice.'</p>",
  "Nothing was possible without the Americans. Tony Blair thought, as have so many British Prime Ministers before him, that he enjoyed a special relationship with the President. There was a personally easy chemistry and similar outlook. To Blair and those around him, Bill Clinton had been an example and an inspiration. Campbell, watching Clinton perform alongside Blair on one occasion, turned to a journalist and said: 'I wish I could get my guy to do that.' Blair's very private tribute to Clinton's political guiles was to joke: 'Bill gives great blow.' <p>Since the election, Blair had handsomely paid off any debts he might owe to Clinton by offering himself as a supportive figleaf for the morally denuded President. He was virtually alone in defending Clinton when he bombed Sudan, widely seen as an attempted distraction from the Lewinsky impeachment. When the total and tawdry seediness of his mendacities was finally exposed, and even Hillary was attacking her husband, Blair flew to the side of 'my friend' in the Oval Office. Though he offered himself as a body shield in public, Blair now appreciated the character flaws in the man he regarded as a mentor in power. </p> <p>Clinton was politically and emotionally desiccated by the Lewinsky saga. Deferential to the President at the outset of the Kosovo conflict, Blair had found him frustratingly unfocused, frequently confused, and fixated with US public opinion. When Blair tried to get Clinton to think about what they would do if the air campaign failed, Clinton kept replying: 'We keep on bombing. We can bomb for ever.' </p> <p>As a Boeing 747 flew him across the Atlantic for the Nato summit in Washington, Blair knew it was going to be a struggle to get 'my buddy Bill', as he had sardonically taken to calling him, to engage on the subject of ground troops. He nevertheless had to try. </p> <p>The moment they touched down at Andrews air force base on the evening of Wednesday 21 April, Blair and his officials were whisked in a convoy of limousines to two hours of talks at the White House. </p> <p>He tried to persuade the sceptical Americans by pitching it positively. Troops would be needed to police a settlement. They should be readying themselves for that. They needed 'to start planning for success'. 'I'm worried about the Russians,' said Clinton. Talk of troops would inflame Moscow. They needed Boris Yeltsin to broker a deal with the Serbs. This was a genuine concern, but Clinton's greatest fright was risking the lives of US soldiers. 'You've got to understand my difficulties, Tony,' he said.Torn between his advisers, muddled within himself, Clinton gave little hope to the Prime Minister. </p> <p>There was more discouraging news from Sir Charles Guthrie, the Chief of the Defence Staff, who had gone to the Pentagon to try to open minds there. He had been rebuffed. </p> <p>The following night, the President hosted a banquet for Nato, originally intended as a fiftieth birthday celebration, now a sombre feast of war. The banqueters finished at 11pm, and Clinton and Blair, Hillary and Cherie, retreated to the Clintons' private quarters to talk into the early hours.Blair was always surprised by how much time Clinton could find just to sit around watching videos, drinking beer and shooting the breeze. Alone with Blair, away from his advisers, Clinton emitted more encouraging signals. 'What's the bottom line?' asked Blair. 'The bottom line is this. We have to see this thing through. Milosevic has to know that we will do whatever it takes to win.' Clinton replied: 'Whatever it takes, whatever it takes. We will not lose.' </p> <p>Could Blair be sure he meant this? Was it merely a demonstration of Clinton's talent for giving 'great blow'? Blair afterwards confessed to one aide that he still had 'no idea' whether Clinton would really commit to ground troops. </p> <p>Blair's growing frustration was reciprocated by Clinton's mounting irritation with the adulatory media Blair received in the US, much of it at the President's expense. The morning after their talks at the White House, the conservative Wall Street Journal acclaimed Blair for pressing firmness on 'a reluctant White House'. The liberal New York Times dubbed him 'King Tony'.The Los Angeles Times reported that 'Britain's Prime Minister is emerging as the alliance's most outspoken hawk.' Blair's appearances on TV shows won the glowing approbation of Republicans. Clinton's political opponents relished making a contrast between the waffling prevarications of the President and the vigour of the purposeful-sounding Blair. The White House was annoyed. Clinton's aides mocked Blair's 'Churchillian tone'. </p> <p>Blair returned from the summit feeling bleak. 'Nothing has been resolved,' he despaired to one aide. He was fearful that he had strutted too hawkishly. 'I've gone at it too hard,' he confided to a close friend. By 'upstaging' Clinton, he had made the President look 'weak'. Clinton would be 'even more reluctant' to make a commitment to troops because it would look as if he had been 'bounced by me'. </p> <p>It was likely that a hint, if not the full measure, of Blair's angst about the President would eventually surface in the media. On 18 May, Clinton was shown a New York Times report about Downing Street's pressure for troop deployment. He exploded into one of his legendary temper tantrums. Early in the afternoon - evening in London - he rang Blair. 'Get your people under control,' he bellowed across the Atlantic. 'This briefing has got to stop.' They could have their private debates but 'it isn't doing anybody any good' for their arguments to emerge in the media. This just played into the hands of Milosevic. 'I promise you,' replied Blair, 'there isn't any briefing by us.' This was true: Blair had always taken the view that, much though he despaired of the pusillanimous Clinton, it was counter-productive to expose the division between Downing Street and Oval Office. Clinton's temper subsided. The remainder of a 90-minute conversation was more productive. 'We've got to get this sorted,'contended Blair. 'We can't let it drag on.' </p> <p>Blair himself 'never wavered once', according to someone very close to him. Officials and aides pressed him to prepare exit strategies, to give himself enough room in his statements to leave a way out. To their high alarm, Blair refused: 'This is shit or bust.' </p> <p> \u00a9 2000 Andrew Rawnsley. </p> <p>Extracted from Servants of the People by Andrew Rawnsley, to be published by Hamish Hamilton on 25 September at \u00a317.99.</p> <p>To order this book for \u00a314.99 plus 99p p&amp;p, call Observer Culture Shop on 0800 3168 171</p>",
  "Wearing a public mien of calm, on Monday 21 December, Peter Mandelson went down to Greenwich for an inspection tour of the Millennium Dome, which was soon interrupted by urgent instructions to talk to Downing Street. Back at No 10, Derry Irvine and Charlie Falconer, the lawyers of the Blair court, were brought into the discussions with Campbell about how to try to control the loan story. At this meeting, Jonathan Powell produced a note from Sir Richard Wilson. After talking to the DTI's Permanent Secretary Sir Michael Scholar, the Cabinet Secretary confirmed that Mandelson had been properly insulated from the DTI inquiries into Robinson. But both the civil servants also took the view - which Wilson conveyed to Blair - that for Mandelson to be so hugely and secretly indebted to the Paymaster-General was nevertheless 'a very big problem'. <p>On Monday afternoon, the Guardian formally approached Mandelson and Robinson for confirmation of the details of the loan. Into the placidity of the Christmas recess, a period usually devoid of big political events, the bomb detonated.</p> <p>A strangely unperturbed Mandelson convinced himself he could walk through the fire. Blair was instinctively and immediately doubtful that he could possibly survive what he and Campbell both knew would be an inferno. The press secretary briefed political correspondents that the Prime Minister did not regard it as 'a hanging offence', which fell far short of a ringing statement of confidence.</p> <p>For the next 24 hours, beginning with Monday's Newsnight, on which he declared, 'There is no conflict of interest so the question of resignation does not arise', Mandelson toured the TV and radio studios, determined to tough it out. As he told one friend: 'I've learnt from my personal life that you have to stand up to these fuckers. If they scent blood, they will come for the kill.'</p> <p>But the more Mandelson talked, the more questions were raised. Should he have declared the loan in the Register of Members' Interests? Had he revealed the loan to the Britannia Building Society when he applied for a mortgage? After a period of equivocation, Mandelson confessed that he had not. Wegg-Prosser was alerted to this deadly question on Monday night during a conversation with Piers Morgan, the editor of the Mirror. Mandelson's own aide concluded then that his master could not survive. 'Peter's finished,' Wegg-Prosser told one of Blair's aides. 'It's the size of it,' was Blair's private verdict to aides and officials about why the loan was so devastating. For the price of Mandelson's house in an elite enclave of west London could be bought a street of homes in his constituency of Hartlepool.</p> <p>Blair's initial prognosis that Mandelson was not to be saved was hardening by Tuesday morning into a certainty that he had to be severed. Alastair Campbell, thinking the media would never let go until Mandelson resigned, and Anji Hunter, protective of Blair's reputation, were both urging the Prime Minister to dispatch the Trade and Industry Secretary. Blair turned to another confidant for advice. He rang Philip Gould, who was spending Christmas in Jamaica. As warm as the weather was in the Caribbean, Blair's chilly fury transmitted itself down the line. 'Why aren't you here when I need you?' Blair snapped. Gould, while registering Blair's shock and anger, attempted to offer pleas in mitigation. After everything Mandelson had done to create New Labour, should he have his five-month career in the Cabinet terminated? 'You should hold on to Peter. You shouldn't give in to our enemies,' Gould argued. 'If you let Peter go, you'll be weakened.' Blair perceived that, but he saw himself and the Government being more damaged by letting Mandelson hang on. In response to Gould's entreaties to save Mandelson, Blair was stony: 'Look. Read the papers, Philip. Think again.' The phone went down.</p> <p>Blair had retired to Chequers when, at 10 on the night of Tuesday 22 December, he talked again to the man whose skills once so mesmerised him. Blair was not good at breaking bad news. He particularly did not relish telling a friend as old and as close as Mandelson that he wanted him gone. He allowed the other man to lead the conversation, asking for his own assessment. Mandelson still believed himself to be the victim of a 'stitch-up' by the Brownites. The press were 'completely hysterical' and 'out of control'. He had made a mistake, he was prepared to admit that now. Yet he clung to the belief that he could and must remain in the Cabinet.</p> <p>Mandelson did float the idea that he might have to resign. By describing this as 'very painful', he evidently hoped that Blair would respond by dismissing the idea. The words that would have been music for him were the Prime Minister saying that he wasn't going to sacrifice him under pressure from the media, and that the No 10 propaganda organ would be pumped to save him. How Blair replied was therefore a crushing disappointment. He told Mandelson that they should 'sleep on it'. Such an expert reader of the codes of political conversation grasped what Blair was semaphoring. The Prime Minister and those advising him wanted to see the following morning's newspapers before they made a final decision.</p> <p>The press was savage, though not unanimously so. The Guardian, the paper that broke the story, pronounced him guilty of 'more vanity than venality' and judged that resignation would be a sentence out of proportion to the crime. The Sun, which Mandelson once so assiduously courted, had gone down on him. The tabloid shrieked: 'So How The Hell Can Mandy Stay?' There were ironies to be savoured. Among the people whom Mandelson had cultivated was Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of the man who owned the Sun.</p> <p>Even now, a large percentage of Mandelson believed he could yet save his place in the Cabinet. At seven on Wednesday morning he phoned Wegg-Prosser to tell him to organise a 'fight-back' meeting at the DTI with Campbell, his deputy, Lance Price, and Jonathan Powell. Mandelson also talked twice to Gordon Brown. It is an example of the weird convolutions of their relationship that Mandelson turned to the man whom he suspected to have played a large role in precipitating the most traumatic moment of his career. In their first conversation, Brown expressed the view that he should apologise but not resign. Guilt may have been speaking. Mandelson would later come to the conclusion that, while Brown intended to damage, the Chancellor did not expect to destroy him. Anxiety was also informing Brown's reaction. He had reason to fear that, if Mandelson went, all the heat would concentrate on whether he and his coterie had connived to demolish a fellow Minister to the detriment of the Government. An exiled Mandelson would thirst for revenge. When he spoke to Brown for a second time that morning, the Chancellor sombrely rated Mandelson's survival prospects to be much more occluded. By now, Brown had spoken to Blair and discovered how conclusively determined the Prime Minister was to sack Mandelson.</p> <p>The fight-back meeting never happened. At shortly after 10am, Campbell and the others from No 10 arrived in Mandelson's ministerial suite in the DTI tower with its panoramic view of Westminster Abbey. Almost immediately, Campbell ordered everyone else out of the room and into the next door Private Office so that Mandelson could be put through to Blair.</p> <p>Blair was now explicit. The longer Mandelson tried to cling on, the more Mandelson and the Government would be damaged. Mandelson repeatedly asked Blair if that was really his opinion, in an effort to seek out a chink of weakness. That was his view, Blair flatly confirmed, offering the consolation that the quicker he left the Cabinet, the better chance there would be of a reasonably rapid return. By the end of the conversation, tears were trickling down Mandelson's sepulchral white cheeks. A dark-eyed Campbell, himself blubbing, gave Mandelson a hug.</p> <p>Recovering from this lachrymose moment with professional speed, Campbell then wrote a resignation letter for Mandelson and a reply for Blair. Campbell took his compositions to Wegg-Prosser to type up. The wretched Mandelson signed Campbell's draft virtually unaltered, though he first faxed it over to Gordon Brown for him to see. He wanted the Chancellor to taste some of the grief that had been inflicted on him. Blair faxed back Campbell's draft of the Prime Minister's reply with some added personal touches.</p> <p>The Chancellor spread the word among his entourage that their enemy had fallen. Ed Balls and his wife, Yvette Cooper, were on the road, driving to spend Christmas with parents. At precisely the moment that Gordon Brown rang his mobile, Ed and Yvette realised they had forgotten the turkey they were providing for the family Christmas. 'He's gone,' announced Brown. 'We've got to turn back,' Balls said to his wife. 'No, you don't understand. There's no turning back,' said Brown. 'He's resigning at 11 o'clock.' </p> <p>The announcement actually came slightly later, just before the lunchtime news bulletins. Soon after, Robinson was gone as well. Mandelson's resignation missive began: 'I can scarcely believe I am writing this letter...', which was scarcely surprising to those who knew that it had been composed by Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>The swiftness of his departure, and the manner in which it had been dressed up in the resignation letter ghosted by Campbell, succeeded in creating the impression that he had honourably withdrawn to spare the Government prolonged torture at the hands of its opponents. Denis MacShane, the Labour MP for Rotherham, voiced a widely believed platitude: 'Nothing became Peter's holding of high office as the manner of his leaving.' The notion that this was a graceful, selfless sacrifice was deceptive. Peter Mandelson did not fall on his sword. Tony Blair gently, firmly, ruthlessly and necessarily thrust Mandelson on to the blade.</p> <p>Blair's fury was accompanied by a sense of loss. He saw the gaping tear left in the Cabinet. Mandelson had been a Blairite before Blair. He was one of the few who could be called believers in New Labour from more than convenience or sycophancy. There was also the worry for Blair of what a wretchedly depressed Mandelson might do.</p> <p>At around noon on the day of the resignation, the Prime Minister asked Mandelson to Chequers, a characteristically kindly, but also calculating, gesture. It is a sign of the froideur between them that Cherie initiated the call. 'You will always be part of the family,' she told Mandelson. Only when his wife had broken the ice did Blair himself come on the line to say: 'We want you to be with us.' Mandelson and his partner, Reinaldo Avila Da Silva, joined the Blairs' family supper and spent the night. Mandelson was now contrite. 'I know I've done a terrible thing,' he confessed to Blair. 'I've hurt you and I've hurt the Government.' Blair had written out some advice about how to work his passage back: sell the house, get around the constituencies, be a team player. 'For God's sake,' he said to Mandelson. 'Make some friends in the Labour Party.'</p> <p>An ocean of bad blood had been spilt. To the poisonous feud between Brown and Mandelson, and the destabilising rivalry of Blair and Brown, there had now been added a twist to the relationship between Blair and Mandelson. Blair could never again invest quite the same level of trust in Mandelson's judgment.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/focus/story/0,6903,369245,00.html\">Extract four: How Kosovo strained Blair's 'special relationship'</a></p>",
  "Gordon Brown left the 1998 Blackpool conference early for a meeting of the IMF in Washington. The Chancellor, and his advisers, Ed Balls and Charlie Whelan, were driven to Manchester airport by a party activist. As they sat in his people carrier that Tuesday afternoon, the car radio broadcast Blair's speech. 'Yes, we are New Labour. But don't give me this nonsense that we're just a more moderate or competent Tory government,' said the Prime Minister, listing New Labour's achievements. As Blair orated, Brown began a muttering heckle of the voice coming out of the radio. 'The New Deal is up and running,' cried Blair. 'He didn't want that,' grunted Brown. 'What Tory Government would have introduced the first statutory minimum wage,' boasted Blair. 'He opposed that,' rumbled Brown. 'The working families tax credit,' soared Blair. 'He fought that,' growled Brown.His mood blackened as Blair sucked in applause for successes Brown regarded as his own. <p>More hatefully for the Chancellor, Peter Mandelson was in the first flush of a honeymoon as Trade and Industry Secretary. Civil servants reported how much they enjoyed working with one of the big hitters of New Labour. Even his old foe, Clare Short, paid a half-compliment when she thanked Mandelson for his party conference address with the remark: 'Peter, you're much better out of the dark.' </p> <p>Mandelson's misfortune, albeit one to which he made the greatest contribution, was to personify the least attractive aspects of New Labour's personality to its critics. He was a gift to satirists, Rory Bremner portraying him as a malevolent, swivel-headed android who 'knows where you live'. Even his own aide, Ben Wegg-Prosser, referred to his boss as 'the sinister Minister'. Many of the legends about Mandelson were journalistic or self-invention. The pale intriguer was the most overblown myth of all. Mandelson was capable of intestinal deviousness, that was true. What he was not was cool. Contrary to his public image, this highly emotional man was as changeable as the British weather. Depending on his state of mind and the company, Mandelson might be charming, kind, witty, unswervingly loyal and utterly reliable; or petulant, bullying, vain, aloof and manipulative. The Machiavellian mantle cloaked profound insecurity. Mandelson was the Wizard of Oz. Behind the front of omnipotence trembled a man frantically pulling levers to keep the disbelief of the audience suspended and terrified that someone would tear aside the curtain.</p> <p>He claimed to be 'tribally, habitually, congenitally Labour'. There was more Labour in the genes of the grandson of Herbert Morrison than in the marrow of Tony Blair. Yet Blair did not insult the tribe as gratuitously as Mandelson. Addressing executives in Silicon Valley in October, he told them that New Labour 'is intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich'. It was one thing to have ended Labour's visceral aversion to wealth creation. It was quite another to replace it with a dumb adoration of riches and contempt for more humbly endowed folk.</p> <p>'Peter was on this extraordinary, violent rollercoaster,' says one of his friends. 'In the space of 18 months, he had gone from a well-known figure in London to one of the most famous politicians in Europe.'</p> <p>Mandelson swanked around the salons of the wealthy, the powerful and the right-wing. His friend and, for a time, upmarket landlady, the Tory hostess Carla Powell, called him 'a groupie for greatness'. To Rupert Murdoch was attributed the observation that Mandelson was 'easy' because he was 'a star fucker'. Mandelson would subsequently have a flash of self-recognition: 'I came over a bit grand. I was trophy-like. I was caught up in a bit of a whirl.' In pride of place on the mantelpiece of his, soon to be infamous, house in Notting Hill, he displayed his invitation to Prince Charles's fiftieth birthday party. He was the only member of the Cabinet to go.</p> <p>His stay with Prince Charles and his mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles, at Sandringham angered those friends who tried to protect Mandelson from himself. 'It was an idiot thing to do,' said someone very close to him who appreciated how this behaviour fed resentment.</p> <p>Mandelson's style of life caused increasing aggravation within No 10. Alastair Campbell mocked his love of the 'fancy dinner party' circuit. Anji Hunter, Blair's personal assistant, told him: 'You've got to stop walking around with your nose in the air.' She worried to Blair that 'Peter is riding for a fall.' Blair gave Mandelson more than one private warning to mind the more exotic company he was keeping.</p> <p>Another swirl of personal publicity gusted around him in the autumn. Ron Davies's nocturnal safari on Clapham Common - the 'moment of madness' which cost him his job as Welsh Secretary - sparked a media hunt to drag homosexual members of the Cabinet out of the closet. One of those who rallied to Mandelson during the outing episode was Philip Gould. As they sat together in Mandelson's Notting Hill house, staked out by reporters and photographers, Gould scented the fear on his friend. He worried that Mandelson would soon be plunged into something 10 times worse.</p> <p>His autumn of tribulations was relished by no one more than Mandelson's enemies in the Treasury, not least because the Brown camp believed that Mandelson, during the campaign to win the leadership for Blair in 1994, was responsible for spreading dirty rumours about the Chancellor's sexuality.</p> <p>The war of manoeuvre between Brown/Whelan and Blair/Mandelson did not end with the July reshuffle. One piece of territory to be struggled over was the New Statesman. Geoffrey Robinson had rescued the ailing magazine before the election. Subsidised with his money, it had become essential reading for anyone interested in understanding the Government. Yet its number of readers barely matched the population of a small town. It was an illustration of the sharp rivalry between the camps that this small-circulation magazine was nevertheless considered a prize worth grappling over.</p> <p>In early November, Robinson was summoned to see the Prime Minister. Brown hastily convened his cabal in the Chancellor's cavernous quarters at the Treasury to wish good luck to Robinson. They all assumed that Blair, having been persuaded by Brown not to dispose of the Paymaster-General in the summer, was now about to ditch him out of the Government. Arriving at No 10, Robinson was surprised to be greeted by a smiling Prime Minister. There was something else on the agenda. Blair wondered whether he would consider selling the New Statesman. Robert Harris, the millionaire author so close to Mandelson that the Minister was a godfather to one of the Harris children, wanted to buy it. Why not - Blair suggested - give up the magazine to Harris? Though Blair was much too subtle to make this explicit, Robinson took the implication to be that this could be a quid pro quo for remaining in the Government. Having told Blair he would 'talk to Harris', Robinson returned to the Treasury. Brown and company expressed their disgust at the schemes of Mandelson and Blair's willingness to be a frontman for the plot.</p> <p>What Robinson was not to know was that Brown, the man he took to be his friend and protector, was behaving most deviously towards him. That same month the invigilators of MPs' behaviour, the Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges, ordered Robinson to apologise to the House for failing to declare all of his financial interests. He made the apology notable by its 54-second brevity. Since September, the DTI had been investigating Robinson. By November, the inquiry was examining 13 possible breaches of company law. As all this produced a cascade of black headlines, Brown felt threatened by association. The Chancellor went to the Prime Minister to discuss the Paymaster-General. Blair listened with growing astonishment as Brown told him that Robinson had become an 'embarrassment' . Fending off the deluge of damaging publicity was a 'distraction' which was undermining his work and his position. Brown said: 'You should have got rid of Geoffrey in the summer.' Blair could not believe what he was hearing. He erupted: 'For fuck's sake, Gordon, I wanted to sack him. It was you who made me keep him on.'</p> <p>Robinson was, of course, entirely unaware that Brown, whom he took to be his guardian against Blair, had conspired behind his back to have him sacked.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/focus/story/0,6903,369236,00.html\">Extract two: Everyone knows except Tony</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>The Shining (1977)</strong></p> <p>While containing all the intensity of Kubrick's film, King's original novel is both darker and more affecting. </p> <p>An oblique response to the fears that accompanied his drinking, his writing here is edgy and raw, and Jack Torrance - far more human than Jack Nicholson's cartoonish villain - is among Stephen King' most compulsive creations.</p> <p><strong>Rage (1977)</strong></p> <p> Originally written when he was 18 and eventually published under the pseudonym of Richard Bachmann, this long novella tells the story of a boy who terrorises his classmates with a gun. King thinks of it as the first time his imagination really took off on the page, and the psychological drama of his prescient vision stands the test of time well. The book was withdrawn by King in America after the shootings at Columbine High.</p> <p><strong>Misery (1987)</strong></p> <p> King's compact horror story about a woman who imprisons her favourite writer and tortures him until he writes the book she wants, is both a flawless psycho-drama and a comic take on the pressures and paranoias of bestsellerdom: number-one writer meets number-one fan. Annie Wilkes gives visceral life to a typical King inversion: the nurse as psychopath.</p> <p> <strong>The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon (1997)</strong></p> <p> King injects vivid and moving energy into the structure of an archetypal fairy story. A girl, hiking with her parents, gets lost. Told in a compelling and word-perfect first person, the entire taut narrative relates the story of her attempts to return to civilisation. King's grasp of fundamental fears and our mechanisms for containing them appears effortless. </p> <p><strong>Hearts in Atlantis (1999)</strong></p> <p> King came of age during the war in Vietnam and, though he was not drafted, this is his inspired statement of the effect the war - and the 60s - had on the American soul. Told in interlinked novellas that range from 1960 to the present day, it shows the writer at his most heartfelt and thoughtful - while still firing on all cylinders as a storyteller.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/authors/author/0,5917,-98,00.html\">Stephen King on Books Unlimited</a></p>",
  "<p>There was only one moment in talking to Stephen King when he seemed uneasy, spooked. In his prefab office on an industrial estate, surrounded by Wal-Marts and warehouses out near the airport in Bangor, Maine, he was happy to open up about his addictions, his fears and his frailties. From behind a grizzled beard, through his thick glasses, he could laugh a little at last year's near miss with death in a road accident, even about the chronic pain in his shattered and pinned leg, for which he continues to take 'pills by the jarful'. But when, about halfway through the afternoon, we started to talk about his father, he stuttered a little, lost some of the warm articulation of his voice, and the rolling laugh that overtook him every now and then was replaced by a nervous chuckle. </p> <p>He seemed annoyed at himself for these slight tremors, and also faintly amused that it still affected him at all to talk in this way. It was not as though he hadn't been called on to explain it all before. King's father did the classic disappearing act when his son was two: went out to get a beer and was never seen or heard from again. His mother, who once believed she had spotted her lost husband on some grainy newsreel footage from Puerto Rico, never quite got over the small-town shame - and shame, King believes, is the most easily transferable of human emotions.</p> <p>'When my brother and I went off to school I can remember her very clearly saying, \"Now, if anybody asks about your father, tell them he's in the navy. That's not a lie.\" It wasn't a lie as far as we knew. But we sure as hell didn't know what was the truth. But I got the point: I was not a bastard. So that's what I said all through school, word for word.'</p> <p>Once, on a TV documentary, King made what struck me as an extraordinary statement. Talking about The Shining, a book, as he admits, 'about a man who wants to eat up his child', he noted that to his mind the nightmarish novel had an optimistic side - 'If a father is raging like that at a child, at least that father is there. For me there was just this vacuum, this empty place...' Thinking about that, there seemed an odd unanswered question. Here was perhaps the greatest suspense writer in the world, prepared to look harder at the more inexplicable extremes of human behaviour than almost anyone; he had virtually unlimited resources - he makes around $40 million 'in a good year' - so why wasn't he ever more curious to solve the big mystery at the heart of his own life: the question of where his dad went when he slipped out that afternoon?</p> <p>When I put this question to him, King paused for a few moments, shifted a little in his chair to get his remade hip more comfortable. Then he said something that seemed to come as a surprise, even to him. 'Well, we did find him, actually,' he explained slowly. 'What happened was this. The CBS TV network does these celebrity bios. They did one about me a little while ago, and they talked to my brother, and my brother had, he remembered, my dad's social security number, and one of these documentary guys went out and found him,' he laughed a little at the ridiculous ease of it, the vacuum suddenly filled, just like that. 'My father, it turned out, apparently died in Pennsylvania in the mid-80s. We even got some pictures. He had started a new family: three boys and a girl. My half-brothers and my half-sister.'</p> <p>He half-smiled at the thought. They've never met? 'Not at all. No. Never,' he said quickly. 'They don't know of my existence, and I think that's the way it should be.'</p> <p>Why? 'Well,' he suggested, a little curiously, 'the woman my father married was a Brazilian - very beautiful from the pictures I saw - and it's reasonable to assume she was Catholic. In that case, bigamy is a very serious thing, and it would have serious consequences for those children, and I couldn't bring them that knowledge...' He leaned back in his chair. 'I haven't talked about all this before,' he explained. 'Because I don't want that story widely published in the United States, for obvious reasons...'</p> <p>Stephen King's life sometimes seems swamped, overflowing with stories, some of them told, many of them, like this one, bursting to get out. He likens his fiction to a conduit or a sewer, depending on his mood, and there is never a lull in its output; huge new novels flood forth and old ones continually seep out from bottom drawers or dusty attics. Someone once claimed that every literate home in America had a Stephen King book in it; he seems to be on a one-man mission to keep Hollywood in screenplays. But all of this gushing narrative energy, he claims, has little to do with will or choice, he has no control over it, he's swept away midstream.</p> <p>He says he knew very early on that he'd become a storyteller. 'It's like something my mother said,' he explained. 'When she was pregnant with me she'd go out to the road and take the tar up, and chew the tar, because there was something in that tar, that, she, I, needed. It was a craving in her. Writing's like that for me. We all like to think about how smart we are. But I think talent as a writer is hard-wired in. You can't change it any more than you can choose whether to be right-handed or left-handed.'</p> <p>If his father has never been a presence in his life, King is still perhaps in this way his father's son. Donald King was in the merchant marines during the war, but when at home he wrote stories. Growing up, and starting out with his own fiction, King was unaware of this, but later his mother told him how the house had always been full of manuscripts. 'He used to send these things to magazines like Argosy and True. Magazines that don't really have an equivalent now, with, like, pictures on the front of guys fighting off grizzly bears with knives. Writing's a gene, no question, like the colour of your eyes.'</p> <p>Perhaps the world's genome mappers, if they are in search of a storyteller's particular cartography, could do worse than look at King's new book On Writing, part memoir, part novelist's vade mecum, which seeks to explain Stephen King's craving.</p> <p>'I sort of hope,' he said, smiling, 'it'll be a renegade primer. I don't think teachers will get away with assigning it to 13-year-olds, but I hope those 13-year-olds will find it on their own.'</p> <p>In it, he wanted to address that central question, the one with which he is assailed by fans and journalists: why does he write the awful things that he writes? 'And, like I say', he said, 'there's no direct way to answer that question, but I think, too, there are a set of experiences that turn a potential writer into a working writer, so I called the first section of the book \"CV\" because I wanted to say: here are my references, this is how I got here.'</p> <p>And how King got here is a tale worth telling. It contains, along the way, the story of how, at the age of four, he watched his best friend run over by a train, his mortal remains collected in a wicker basket; the report of his brother's half-cocked attempts at blowing up their town with amateur science experiments; his own obsession with Edgar Allan Poe movies and the copies of home-printed short stories he flogged around his school; and the tales of bullies and the bullied in a claustrophobic childhood community populated by characters like his friend, Tommy Davis, who every day went through the obituary column of the local newspaper and methodically crossed out the names listed there from his telephone directory at home. </p> <p>It is a tale filled throughout with the familiar Stephen King mixture of bucolic innocence and visceral horror. This dichotomy found its first expression in King, when, aged 11, he kept all the cuttings he could find on teenage serial killer Charlie Starkweather, who murdered 11 people in the Midwest in 1958. The attraction was not so much vicarious violence as self-preservation, 'my keeping a scrapbook on his progress was never like, \"Yeah, go Charlie, kill some more.\" It was more like, \"Charlie: if I ever see anyone like you, I'll be able to get the hell away.\" And I do think the very first time I saw a picture of him, I knew I was looking at the future. His eyes were a double zero. He seemed an outrider of what America might become...'</p> <p>King says he was not trying to sort out subconscious lumber through writing the memoir; he is not a fan of psychoanalysis: 'I think if you have real mental problems what you need are good pills.' But he does believe that if you have things that are unresolved, the more you talk about them, write about them, the less likely they are to damage you. At least, he said, smiling, that is how he has come to understand his work in retrospect.</p> <p>In this sense, his greatest fear, you imagine, is that all the stories will one day dry up. He speaks periodically about this coming drought, suggests occasionally that he is thinking of giving up writing, 'I just hope I know when to stop, when it starts to get repetitive. I have these Dark Tower books [a fantasy saga of seven, each about 700 pages long, inspired by Browning's dream poem 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came', of which four are done] that I'd like to finish, but then other things come along and you get interested in them, too.'</p> <p>The things he is interested in currently, include a new novel (his 36th) called Dreamcatcher, that he wrote while recuperating from his accident; a book he's collaborating on with the sci-fi writer Peter Straub called Talisman II; and a musical he's developing with the singer/songwriter John Cougar Mellencamp, ('He got in touch with me and said he had an idea for a play, so he came over to the house, tuned my guitar for me - it never sounded better - and told me this story, a ghost story, which sounded great. If it's ghosts you want I guess I'm the \"go to\" guy...'). There's also the forthcoming movie versions of his novels The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, Hearts in Atlantis and of his story Stud City (which will bring the number of major King film adaptations up to 30), plus a couple of TV mini-series.</p> <p>Oh, and then there's the small matter of the one-man publishing revolution he is organising from his office. The day we met was the day the first chapter of his book The Plant was launched on the internet. Marsha, one of his two assistants, was inputting the copy in the next room. The Plant will be self-published (a return to the dime pamphlets he copied in high school) and payment will be on an honour system: you download it and send King a dollar, if more than 75 per cent pay up he will write the next chapter; if not, he won't. Occasionally, while we were talking, he levered himself up out of his chair and walked stiffly next door to check on progress, and came back grinning. The Wall Street Journal and Newsweek called while I was there, preparing stories on the death of corporate bookselling. 'As I say on the website,' he said at one point, 'we have the chance to be big publishing's worst nightmare.' And he gave me the same boss-eyed Bela Lugosi stare he had hammed up for our photographer earlier, 'Hah!'</p> <p>While listening to Stephen King telling tales about himself, I found myself doodling the words 'irresistible force' on my notepad. He is genial, funny and gracious in person, but there is the sense, too, of a huge, unstoppable energy in him. Part of his memoir deals with his early writing years, when this internal momentum seemed even stronger. There is the poignant story of him living in a trailer park, working all hours in a gruesome hospital laundry, writing his books at home on a typewriter balanced on his knee. He had started selling short fiction to men's magazines while he was in college, got married to his writing-class sweetheart Tabitha six or seven months after graduating, and for two years sold half a dozen stories a year. And then, as he explained to me, he 'sort of got out of the zone. And for a year or so, I couldn't sell anything, and I was drinking a lot - wasn't drugging, couldn't afford it - and </p> <p>I was writing mostly shit, and during that one year, I just thought: I'm going to be a high-school teacher, and nothing's ever going to happen to me. Then Carrie came along and everything changed...'</p> <p>The one thing the success of Carrie did not change, however, was King's drinking. </p> <p>I wondered if he could remember the moment when he knew it was a real problem.</p> <p>'Well,' he said, matter-of-factly, as if reciting a character's case history, 'I started drinking when it was legal for me to, and there was never a time when the goal wasn't to get as hammered as I could possibly afford to. I never understood social drinking, that's always seemed to me like kissing your sister.'</p> <p>By the mid-70s, as his career took off, King was drinking a case of beer before dinner every night, and then he would really get started. In On Writing, he talks about the negligible effect this spectacular consumption had on his productivity, but he is less forthcoming about the effect it had on his family life. The demons that make Jack Torrance want to destroy his wife and child in The Shining are conjured by his alcoholism. How close to home was that fear?</p> <p>'It's hard to say,' King suggested. 'My wife has told me since that I was hungover every morning until about two in the afternoon, and from five until midnight I was drunk out of my mind. She said there was this period of about three hours each afternoon when she could talk to me like a human being.' He laughed at the idea of this brief window of sanity. 'I was never the guy who said, \"Let's have a gin and tonic before dinner.\" I'd have to have, like, 12 gin and tonics and then I'd have to say fuck dinner and have 12 more. So I guess that was difficult to live with from time to time...'</p> <p>He did not go to bars much - 'one drunken asshole was all I could handle and that was me' - and he was writing most of the days. He believes that his two sons, both now writers, and his daughter, an Episcopalian minister, accepted his drinking as a part of life. 'Not a particularly pernicious part, either. I didn't beat up on them. Basically, I don't think I was so different from a lot of dads who have three or four martinis when they get in from work, wine with dinner and so on...'</p> <p>By 1979, however, and though still drinking, King was looking elsewhere for his highs. 'The drugs were a different story,' he explained. 'With cocaine, one snort and it just owned me, body and soul. It was like something in my system wanted that. When you turn on lights, there's no halfway. Cocaine was my on-switch. I did it for about eight years. Not a terribly long time to be an addict, I guess. But it's longer than World War Two...' he laughed his vaudeville laugh. 'And that's how it felt a lot of the time. I didn't really hide my drinking, but I hid my drugs, because I knew right away it was a problem.'</p> <p>If his drinking fears came out in The Shining, his drug paranoias found metaphorical expression in The Tommyknockers, a sci-fi fable in which the thought processes of a town's population are colonised by aliens: what the Tommyknockers offered their victims was 'energy and superficial intelligence'; what they extracted was their soul. A couple of the other books from this period King cannot remember writing a word of. Still, looking back now, he can be philosophical about it all. 'I like to think my coke addiction was a blessing in disguise,' he explained. 'Because I think without coke I'd have gone on drinking until about the age of 55 and it would have been a couple of lines in the New York Times: \"Writer Stephen King dies of stroke.\"' As it was, 'Once you add the coke, you eventually tip over, because that stuff just eats you up from the inside out.'</p> <p>King's tipping point came in 1987, when Tabitha collected that week's empties and drug trash and dumped the lot in a heap on the living-room floor in front of her husband. Was that the point at which he started to get himself back together? </p> <p>'Not really,' he said, wincing a little at the idea of his former, loaded, self. 'At that time I was, like, this very successful author, and that kind of success does not really lead you humbly to say, \"Yeah, I guess you're right. I'm an asshole.\" It rather leads you to say, \"Who the fuck are you to tell me to settle down? Don't you understand? I'm the king of the fucking universe...\" The worst of it was 1987 to 88, when I was looking for a d\u00e9tente, a way I could live with booze and drugs without giving them up altogether.' He laughed at the notion. 'Needless to say I was not successful in this.' </p> <p>His great fear, of course, at the time, was that if he jettisoned the booze and drugs, he would also rid himself of his storytelling powers. And, for a while, that seemed to be the case. For nearly a year he resigned himself to the bleak thought that he'd saved his life at the cost of his imagination. 'But I still had my kids. My wife loved me and I loved her. And eventually the writing came back and I discovered that the writing itself was enough of a buzz. Crazy thing is that probably it always had been...'</p> <p>King has been sober ever since. As we sipped grim root beers together - 'just two white guys chilling, hey Tim?' - I suggested to him that it seemed like the other reason he managed to get his life back together was the fact that he lived where he lived.</p> <p>He looked around his office. There was a Boston Red Sox-emblazoned toy Cadillac on the table along with other memorabilia of his work, including a director's chair from The Green Mile. The room had a comfortable homespun feel. Through the window, a couple of blocks away, was the little league baseball diamond King restored and funded; further into Bangor the public library he sponsors, and, just off the Main Street, with its factory outlets and farming suppliers, the Gothic mansion where he lives, writes and practises his guitar playing for the literary garage band he performs with. He is, in every sense of the words, at home.</p> <p>'When I'm in Bangor, people treat me as a neighbour, not as a celebrity freak with two heads, and that's too good to give up,' he explained. 'I've always been in this culture up to my eyeballs... New York isn't America. LA isn't America. This is America. New York is just this gaseous hype, there's no story there, not really. I can't satirise my fellow Americans from here. I am them...'</p> <p>He also feels safer here. Given the fact that he writes America's nightmares, it's not surprising that he worries a little that they will some day turn up on his doorstep. It's why he wanted to see me at his office rather than at his home. And it's why he found himself writing Misery, in which a best-selling novelist is held captive and tortured by a reader (memorably played in the film version by Kathy Bates) until he writes the story she wants.</p> <p>Every now and then he has heard from a version of this 'number-one fan'. There was an occasion a few years ago when his wife, alone in the house, was confronted by a man in her kitchen who claimed he had a bomb (in fact - neat metaphor - it was a bunch of pencils and erasers and paperclips in a box). The police eventually trapped the man, who claimed Stephen King had stolen Misery from his head, in the attic... Sometimes, too, he'll get a letter from someone who is obviously 'out there in the ozone, but no one yet has threatened to kill me, knock on wood. Though there is a guy out in California who believes me and Ronald Reagan conspired to kill John Lennon.'</p> <p>Ironically, and he has been quick to see the irony, when America finally did catch up with King it was in the person of a man who might easily have walked out of a trailer park and into the pages of one of his novels. In June last year, King was taking his daily constitutional one afternoon along the side of the highway near his weekend house in northern Maine, when he was hit by a van and thrown 14ft into the air. The van was driven by a man named Bryan Smith, who had taken his eyes off the road to wrestle with his Rottweiler, Bullet, which was trying to get at some steak in his cool box. King suffered a shattered hip and pelvis, broken ribs, a punctured lung and a fractured thigh bone. </p> <p>While King was recovering from the accident, his wife bought the Dodge mini-van for $1,600 to prevent Smith selling bits of it for souvenirs. When he is more fully recovered, King plans to take a sledgehammer to the van to return the compliment, as it were. Would he, I wondered, as he continues to go through his endless operations, sometimes like to do the same to its driver, who had several previous motoring convictions?</p> <p>He laughed. 'Well, this is a guy who only has a little bit of brains to start with. I mean I sometimes have fantasies about confronting him. But Bryan Smith is like Gertrude Stein said about LA: \"There's no there, there.\"'</p> <p>Reading his account of the story in his memoir, it is hard not to half-believe that the accident was scripted in some way. I wondered if it had changed his ideas of fate.</p> <p>'That's a big question, Tiiiim,' he boomed in reply, and thought for a moment. 'I guess I lean more toward the idea that some force is running things than not. Call it fate, call it God. There are so many things: if I'd left the house five minutes later, or if Tabby had come along as she often did... you can go on with the variables. But what you're left with is this guy, who has the IQ of a tomato-soup can. An empty tomato-soup can. And he hits me at the one blind spot on a long road, no one else to hit for miles, when, say, Nasa can't get a missile to land on Mars with all the brains and technology in the world, then maybe you think there's something odd going on. Or maybe Nasa should just hire Bryan Smith...'</p> <p>The accident has changed King, he says, in different ways. For a start, he appreciates being able to get up in the mornings more than ever, and he's relishing being a grandfather; it has also, perhaps, made him dwell a little on his longevity as a writer.</p> <p>For all his prolific output and enormous sales (probably because of that output and those sales), and for all the variety of his storytelling, the range of his writing, the one thing King hasn't been able to command is critical respect. He once suggested that his books were the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries, and the literary establishment has been happy to take him at his word. His books are routinely ignored in books pages, or judged on their tombstone typefaces. To this extent, some of the motivation behind his memoir is undoubtedly to establish the fact that he knows far more about his craft than the average creative-writing professor would have you believe. </p> <p>I wondered if he still got angry that he was pigeonholed as a horror writer, by his publishers as much as his public.</p> <p>'Ohhh,' he said wearily. 'The short answer is no. But if I see the red gels and the underlighting come out when someone comes to photograph me, I do walk out these days. All that shit to make me look spooky. I ask them if when they are photographing a black writer they bring a watermelon and a barrel for him to sit on, you know... It's degrading to be treated as someone who is so one dimensional. But once they decide you're a whore, they want to put you in a skirt, don't they?'</p> <p>King used to say, 'I'll be a horror writer if that's what people want,' but recently he has seemed less satisfied with that lot. Though still containing their share of terrors, recent novels have explored a whole range of subject matter. Bag of Bones is a surreal self-conscious version of Rebecca, set in upcountry Maine; The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is an intense first-person fairy tale told in the authentic voice of a little girl lost in the woods; Hearts in Atlantis is a book about the Vietnam years to set alongside Michael Herr's Dispatches or Tim O'Brien's short stories. </p> <p>The urge to publish himself on the net could be seen as part of this same impulse, a way for King to wrest back control of his image. It is also, you guess, inspired by a stubborn backwoods dislike of corporate New York, as well as being exactly the kind of Faustian social experiment he relishes in books such as The Stand. King has backed his faith in the idea that three-quarters of mankind (or at least of Stephen King readers) are basically honest: that they will pay their dollar in return for his chapters. Big publishing, of course, hopes that faith is misguided. (At the time of writing, King's judgement about the state of the human soul is proving almost unerring: 152,000 people have downloaded chapter one of The Plant, and 76.23 per cent have paid up.)</p> <p>He has experimented with publishing on the internet before, with his novella Riding the Bullet. On that occasion, although he had 500,000 hits the download often broke down under the weight of the encryption insisted upon by his American publisher. </p> <p>'It was like a fucking dinosaur,' he remembers angrily. 'And that drove me crazy. But the publisher loved that part. They say, like a rallying cry, \"Don't get napstered.\" Don't let the fruits of your artistic endeavour get stolen. But you know as well as I do that publishers, music producers, studio heads, they could not give a shit for the creator... They care about their bank books and that's about all they care about.'</p> <p>King's great strength in all of this is that money doesn't mean that much to him, or at least he has more than he will ever need to buy his T-shirts and jeans, a present for his wife, a new amp for his guitar. But his writing matters to him as much as it ever did, and his publishers will, he seems to be saying, underestimate the strength of that commitment, the irresistible force in Stephen King, at their peril. He is also enjoying it hugely.</p> <p>As if to prove the point, before I left him he worked himself up for one final good natured top-volume rant that began, surreally, with a convincing impression of Kingsley Amis. He dropped his chin to his chest and spoke through jowls. 'There's all these guys, these Kingsley Amis kind of guys,' he began, 'who for years have been saying, you know: \"books are dead, society going down hill, blah, blah, cultural waste land, idiots, idiots, TV, pop music, degrad- ation\" and then something comes along like Harry Potter, fucking thing is 734 pages long and it sells five million copies in 12 hours. That's up there with Britney Spears and Eminem. So the only recourse these people have then is to say [Kingsley again...] \"Well, JK Rowling or Stephen King is not literature.\" WELL, I'M SORRY! It may not be literature in their terms, but it's sure as hell a few rungs up from \"The Real Slim Shady\". </p> <p>'The age of the book is not over. No way. But maybe the age of some books is over. People say to me sometimes, \"Steve, are you ever going to write a straight novel, a serious novel?\" - and by that they mean a novel about college professors who are having impotence problems or something. And I have to say those things just don't interest me. Why? I don't know. But it took me about 20 years to get over that question, and not be kind of ashamed about what I do, of the books I write.' </p> <p>Stephen King paused, took a breath, he got stiffly to his feet, and smiled. 'That's not to say that there won't always be a market for crap... Just look at Jeffrey Archer! He writes like old people fuck, doesn't he?' Then the world's favourite storyteller gave a roar of a laugh, threw his root beer in the trash can, and went next door to check on the progress of the revolution. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/authors/author/0,5917,-98,00.html\">Stephen King on Books Unlimited</a></p>",
  "<p>When buying a new car, consider how much you will lose in depreciation - the biggest single cost in running a new car, says the Consumers' Association (CA). </p> <p>This has always been a problem in the UK car market, mainly because a huge proportion of new car sales are to fleet buyers, such as companies and rental firms, which buy at discounts and can afford to sell a few years later at low prices. CA's advice is: 'Avoid buying new models that depreciate quickly and never pay full list price for a car.' </p> <p>Some cars lose more than two-thirds of their list price within three years, according to CA in the June issue of Which? magazine. The Citro\u00ebn Xantia 2.0iSX, costing around \u00a317,000 new, would be worth around \u00a35,000 after three years. </p> <p>CA found that on average, superminis (such as the VW Polo, Toyota Yaris, Ford Fiesta and Fiat Punto) would retain slightly more of their initial value than other cars. </p> <p>CA, using the motor industry forecaster CAP, evaluated cars to find out which were likely to retain their value best over the next three years. In the large family group the BMW 3 Series (318i SE four-door) leads the way, retaining 56 per cent of its value, followed by the Audi A4 (1.8 SE four-door) and the Mercedes C Class (200 Classic four-door). </p> <p>In the small family group, the Audi A3 (1.6 SE five-door) would retain 55 per cent of its value after three years, followed by the VW Golf (1.6 SE five-door ) and the Mercedes A Class (160 Classic five-door). </p> <p>In the supermini group the VW Polo (1.4 E three-door) would sell for 55 per cent of its value after three years, and it was followed by the Toyota Yaris (1.0 GS three-door) and the VW Lupo (1.0 E three-door). </p> <p>In each of the categories, Citro\u00ebns were at or near the bottom of the league tables. It is probably worth considering an internet-based service, which may import from Europe. These include the Consumers' Association's carbusters.com, Direct Lines's jamjar.com, one swoop.com and virgincars.com. Standards of service are variable, however, and buyers should check delivery times and whether warranties from the Continent extend to the standard three-year guarantees given by UK retailers. </p> <p>When shopping for a second-hand car, <a href=\"http://www.autotrader.co.uk,\">www.autotrader.co.uk,</a> the internet site of The Observer's sister publication Auto Trader, allows you to compare prices of the models you are interested in. </p> <p>Fuel economy is becoming an increasingly important factor for car buyers. The Government regularly surveys cars for fuel economy and publishes its top 10 lists (see table) at <a href=\"http://www.detr.gov.\">www.detr.gov.</a> uk. The AA's website theaa.com includes a list of motoring costs for a variety of different cars. </p> <p> <strong> Financing your car</strong> </p> <p> ACCORDING to internet finance operation E-Loan, (<a href=\"http://www.E-Loan.com/UK)\">www.E-Loan.com/UK)</a> motorists borrow an average of \u00a36,800 to fund the purchase of a car. </p> <p>A survey by rate-tracking service Moneyfacts at the beginning of this month showed that the more competitive rates for \u00a35,000 loans over three years ranged from 9.2 per cent (APR) at Northern Rock to 10.9 per cent at Alliance &amp; Leicester. For car loans, which may include special deals such as a free AA car buyer inspection, they ranged from 9.9 per cent at the Woolwich to 15.9 per cent at Lloyds TSB. </p> <p> <strong> Cutting running costs</strong> </p> <p> Fuel-saving measures won't necessarily cut your petrol bill dramatically, but it is worth knowing the factors behind petrol consumption. </p> <p>The AA calculates that a trip from London to Exeter costing \u00a315 to \u00a320 with normal driving is likely to cost an extra \u00a35 or more if you use your car in the least efficient way. Driving too fast, or too slow, has an impact. Speeding at 80-85 mph increases fuel costs by 25 pence or more for every 10 miles. Every minute idling in a traffic jam costs a small car driver nearly 1.5p and double for a larger car. </p> <p>Here are five more ways to cut petrol consumption. </p> <p>\u0095 Roof racks, even when empty, cut a car's fuel economy by at least 10 per cent and when loaded high can reduce it by 30 per cent. </p> <p>\u0095 Keeping windows and sun roofs open will add \u00a31 to a journey's cost. Try air vents before opening windows. </p> <p>\u0095 Air conditioning eats petrol at a rate of between 5 and 7 per cent more than normal. Don't use it all the time. </p> <p>\u0095 Put a sunscreen inside the windscreen. </p> <p>\u0095 Under-inflated tyres and the weight of passengers will also reduce efficiency by one mile per gallon. If carrying extra passengers or heavy luggage, adjust the tyre pressure to compensate. </p> <p>Replacing your car for a newer one won't necessarily cut your petrol bills, unless you choose a much more fuel-efficient model. Roger Higman, at Friends of the Earth, explains: 'Older cars are dirtier than new cars but not necessarily less fuel efficient.' </p> <p>When garages actually have petrol, costs vary so it may be worth shopping around. A new website, petrolbusters.com, gives quotes for the cheapest petrol prices in postcodes throughout the country. A search by Cash for prices within three miles of a central London postcode showed it would have been possible to cut costs by around 7 per cent for unleaded petrol, from 83.9p a litre, the highest quote, to 77.9 from the cheapest provider, a Sainsbury's service station. The UK average is 80.4p per litre for unleaded petrol. </p> <p>Surveys by the CA have shown that charges for servicing can vary by 100 per cent among dealers appointed by one manufacturer. A major service will on average be 50 per cent more expensive at an appointed dealership than at an independent. But be aware that if you do not go to an approved garage you are likely to invalidate a warranty on a new car, or one bought second-hand from an approved dealer. </p> <p> <strong> Car insurance</strong> </p> <p> The AA's insurance premium index shows that the cost of insuring a car has increased by nearly \u00a3200 on average in the last six years. The AA says: 'When it comes to renewing their comprehensive insurance, car drivers can expect bills to be up by nearly \u00a3100 since last year. </p> <p>Since July 1994, the average premium has risen by \u00a3194, from \u00a3367 to \u00a3561, an increase of nearly 53 per cent.' </p> <p>Despite the general rise, the AA says it may be possible to save as much as 30 per cent on a renewal premium by shopping around. Peoples Choice (tel 0800 11 22 33, <a href=\"http://www.peopleschoice.\">www.peopleschoice.</a> co.uk), claims to have saved up to \u00a31,000 on annual premiums. </p> <p>Internet insurance sites to try include insure.co.uk; egg.com; tesco.com/ finance; theaa.com; autobytel.co.uk; norwichunion. co.uk/; carsource.co.uk/ and carquote.co.uk. </p> <p> Additional research by Natalie Sutton</p>",
  "<p><strong>The German Trauma: Experiences and Reflections 1938-2000</strong><br>Gitta Sereny<br>Allen Lane, The Penguin Press \u00a320, pp378<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502449822,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Gitta Sereny is, surely, our stellar investigative journalist. Hers is a more spacious culture than was Rebecca West's; and the moral passion is often more telling than were the ironies of Mary McCarthy. A fundamental theme unifies much in her articles, reviews, essays and books. It is that of the embodiment of evil, of pathological hatred and unreason. </p> <p>To this black hole, Sereny - the name is finely inappropriate - brings an expertise in psychology and an alertness to social history. Everything suggests, moreover, that Sereny has a special and patient charisma. Doors habitually barred open for her; herself from a privileged background, she is at ease with high society, with the salons of power ('corridors' seems too drab a word).</p> <p>And when Sereny has cornered her quarry, be he politician, academic or sadistic butcher, she closes in with uncompromising acuity, but with a seriousness, an intimation of personal vulnerability which establish a revealing trust. This has been most manifest in her complex relationship - dare one speak of a liaison of sensibility? - with Albert Speer. </p> <p>Speer is present throughout this collection extending from 1967 to 1995 (one unpublished piece is dated 2000). Frequently, Sereny is in inner dialogue with Speer or summons him as witness. She is tormented, as she was in her biography of Hitler's master-builder, by the central crux: what did a man like Speer, so brilliantly gifted, so perceptive, know of the realities of the Holocaust? Did he lie when he professed ignorance or only very indirect, vague awareness? How seriously is one to take his postwar repentance, his expressions of self-condemnation? Was Sereny taken in? In this book of investigations and confrontations, this same question is brought to bear on individual survivors and, by unforced extension, on the German people as a whole. </p> <p>Two axioms underwrite Sereny's tireless sleuthing. She rejects the thesis that the Shoah was unique, a singularity without parallel in human bestiality. Whatever its horror and inconceivably systematic methods, the Auschwitz phenomenon belongs to a context of totalitarian massacres characteristic of the twentieth century. Although there is about such statistical comparisons a touch of obscenity, the fact remains that Stalin and Mao did to hideous death far more men and women than did Hitler. </p> <p>I cannot come to any clear view of this desperate question. There are moments when the Nazi attempt to exterminate all Jews because they existed, because their crime was 'to be', seems to me unlike any other act of crazed savagery. At other moments, I am not certain as to the difference with, say, the massacre of natives in the Belgian Congo (10 million) or that of Armenians or of Kulaks. But though Sereny's posit lacks philosophic reach, it is a respectable hypothesis. </p> <p>Second, this book asks us to grasp, to honour, the extent of German attempts to come to honest terms with the hideous past. West German democracy has laboured to instruct the young as to the facts; it put many of the murderers and torturers on trial, it has built museums and memorials to the victims. I would cite many painful exceptions and look with more apprehension than does Sereny to the venomous spurts of neo-Nazism and racism in Germany today. Nevertheless, Sereny's point is well taken. Her case would have been even more forceful had she drawn a comparison with the continued stench of anti-Semitism, lies or unctuous indifference in Austria since 1945. </p> <p>The most moving witness is that which deals with the slaughter and deportation of children, notably in and from Poland. Sereny was personally involved with UN efforts to find, identify and repatriate children abducted by the Nazis. Should these wretched victims be sent back to a culture, to communities that had become alien to them? There is worse: 'Historically, no Jewish child is known to have survived the four specific extermination camps of Chelmno, Belsec, Sobibor and Treblinka.' This is one of a number of sentences in this book which it is almost unbearable to read, let alone take in. </p> <p>Discussing studies of Hitler and the revisionist filth of those who seek to deny the Shoah, Sereny wonders at the abiding fascination of the man. Is she unconscious of being herself a prime instance? To gauge Hitler's dimensions, one need only bring to mind that history and our present condition would be unimaginably different had one of the bullets which struck Hitler in the trenches in 1914-18 been closer to a vital organ. There were gifted thugs around Stalin; Hitler looks to have been monstrously irreplaceable. </p> <p>Sereny reviews the evidence we have for the fact that an individual's refusal to carry out Waffen-SS orders, to perform bestial acts on civilians, did not entail any grave danger or retribution. Here again, there is a striking difference from the Stalinist regime in which any such refusal brought immediate elimination. The deep-lying contradiction in Sereny's defence of German normality is, however, patent. She refuses Goldhagen's verdict on some inherent criminality in the character and history of Germany. How, then, are we to explain the virtual totality of acquiescence in Nazi policies and actions even where saying 'No' was not a fatal risk? </p> <p>Many other vexed issues are raised in these articles. Clearly, much that speaks of ugliness, corruption and primitive anti-Communism attaches to American protection of notorious Nazis and war criminals at the close of the war. Documents were forged, identities altered, immunities extended by 'at least four US agencies - the OSI, the FBI, Fort Meade and the CIA'. Together with the Vatican, US operatives made possible the escape from justice of some of the worst mass-killers. Reading Sereny's fierce exposures, one can only wonder at her ruling that Speer had to be allowed to 'recapture his lost morality. Unless we deny all men the potential for regeneration, this man, I believe, must now be allowed peace.' </p> <p>In regard to those who have preceded her in these dark waters, Sereny is strikingly ungenerous. Unless I mistake, the name of Eli Wiesel does not appear. </p> <p>A key point on the unacceptability of allowing Hitler to use 'our common language', to let him speak to us directly, echoes almost verbatim a novel and a play widely known prior to Sereny's text. No acknowledgement is granted. For someone of Sereny's quality, such egotism is hardly necessary.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Samuel Pepys: a LIfe</strong><br>Stephen Coote<br>Hodder &amp; Stoughton \u00a320, pp350<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502450747,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>For the past 175 years, the name Samuel Pepys has been synonymous with an activity that none of his contemporaries knew anything about - writing his diary, which was first deciphered and published more than a century after his death. He wrote it in shorthand and partly in code, and so far as we know never shared its contents with anybody, not even his most intimate friends, and certainly not his wife. </p> <p>Had it not been for his diary, Pepys would be remembered, if he were remembered today at all, as a reforming administrator, a confidential adviser to King Charles II and his brother, the Duke of York, (later James II), and to the statesmen that served them. Pepys was, if it is not an oxymoron to say so, a great civil servant, the principal architect of the Royal Navy that was to play such a crucial role in the nation's destiny during the centuries that followed. </p> <p>According to the scholar J.R. Tanner, Pepys was 'one of the best officials England ever had'. He became a grandee, a Member of Parliament, master of Trinity House, a governor of Christ's Hospital, deputy lieutenant for Huntingdonshire and president of the Royal Society. He was the prime mover in the building of the Royal Naval Hospital in Greenwich. But such achievements, solid and worthwhile though they are, do not normally inspire biographies more than three centuries after the subject's death. It is the diary that makes Pepys a figure of universal and lasting interest. </p> <p>Pepys's origins were humble. His father was a London tailor, his mother a laundress. He attended St Paul's School, then, as now, among the best in the land (Milton had been a schoolboy there 20 years earlier) and won an exhibition to Cambridge, where he took a degree at Magdalene. Afterwards, he joined the staff of his influential cousin Edward Montagu, one of the most powerful figures in Cromwell's Protectorate, who, by the time of Cromwell's death, had assumed active control of the Navy. It was at this point, when Pepys was 26 years old, a young clerk on the make, that he began to keep a diary. Less than a decade later, he stopped, mistakenly fearing that the strain on his eyesight might result in blindness. </p> <p>Pepys's diary, therefore, covered fewer than 10 years of his 70-year-long life, but this was to be one of the most eventful decades in English history. Already, as a horrified schoolboy, Pepys had been present at the execution of Charles I. Now, he sailed with the fleet that brought back Charles's son from exile and witnessed the moment when the young Charles II landed at Dover. As the royal barge headed for the shore, one of the spaniels 'shit in the boat, which made us laugh and me to think that a king and all who belong to him are but just as others are'. </p> <p>He was present, too, at the coronation, having secured a good vantage-point some seven hours before the king arrived. These dramatic scenes were recorded in the diary in calm, clear, masculine prose. A few years later, Pepys stayed in London during the plague, while most of those who had somewhere to go fled to the countryside, and the following year he was able to report at first hand the Great Fire of London. </p> <p>These terrible events are magnificently described, and they are interspersed with telling social and psychological detail: for example, his joking response to the king, who asked the passing Pepys where his boat was headed, and received the facetious reply, 'to wait on our masters in Westminster'. After this quip, Pepys wondered if he had gone too far. </p> <p>The diary has achieved a notoriety for what it reveals of Pepys's sex life: seducing vulnerable women and groping young chambermaids. It is perhaps too easy to condemn Pepys, as this biographer does, for being a lecher and a hypocrite. </p> <p>Pepys was at least honest with himself about what he did. He had married for love a girl of only 15 with no fortune or connections; unluckily, she suffered from a recurrent abscess on her labia, which made intercourse difficult. Pepys soon discovered that he was infertile, perhaps another reason for his promiscuity. </p> <p>His patron, Montagu, rose to become Earl of Sandwich, and Pepys followed in his wake. He quickly showed the qualities of an efficient bureaucrat. 'My delight is in the neatness of everything, and so cannot be pleased with anything unless it be very neat.' He was supremely methodical and possessed an ability to master an immense amount of detail quickly; he was an excellent speaker and a fluent writer. He became a wealthy man, a leading figure in naval affairs and, as such, he had to answer to a committee of the House of Commons for the unpreparedness of the Navy during the Second Dutch War, when the Dutch fleet sailed up the Medway and set Chatham on fire, one of the most humiliating episodes in British naval history. </p> <p>After the attack, the popular outrage was such that Pepys feared for his life and property. He took to wearing a belt round his waist containing \u00a3300 in gold, and sent the rest of his valuables away to the country, among them the volumes of his diary, 'which I value much'. </p> <p>Why did Pepys keep a diary? There are tantalising hints in this biography. Pepys was making a balance sheet of his world: 'The historian was writing a history of himself... his diary became his means of coming to an understanding of a new way of life.' To modern readers, it may seem odd that such a man should have felt such a compulsion to write so ambitiously and so revealingly. </p> <p>Unfortunately, Stephen Coote is no writer himself and thus his capacity to help us understand Pepys is limited. His prose is littered with grammatical errors, non sequiturs, false antitheses and words misused. To choose just one example, he seems to think that schadenfreude means a guilty delight in erotica, rather than a malicious pleasure in the misfortune of others. </p> <p>Just as his style is clumsy, so is his history shaky. The figures in Pepys's life are not so much portrayed as caricatured. This poorly edited biography adds nothing new to the much better one by Richard Ollard issued by the same publishers in 1974. </p> <p>Far from offering us a new perspective on Pepys, Coote's book makes him less, rather than more understandable. We see Pepys as through a glass, darkly; his character remains an enigma.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Blind Assassin </strong><br>Margaret Atwood<br>Bloomsbury \u00a316.99, pp525<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502453121,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> Margaret Atwood new novel is made up of three strands. There are the memoirs of Iris Chase, tracing her progress from prosperous beginnings, daughter of a button factory owner, through a loveless marriage to a plutocrat to a solitary and brooding old age. </p> <p>There are excerpts from The Blind Assassin, a posthumously published novel which gave Iris's younger sister, Laura, a minor but (thanks to women's studies) enduring reputation. Laura drove off a bridge in 1945, 10 days after the end of the war. </p> <p>Then there are the pulp science-fiction stories the hero of Laura's book tells his lover in the dingy rooms where they meet. He is a leftist on the run, convenient scapegoat for a factory fire that was presumably an insurance fraud, while she is a prisoner of privilege, sneaking away from her watchers for a few risky hours of pleasure. </p> <p>Margaret Atwood has three times been shortlisted for the Booker, but her first novel to do so, The Handmaid's Tale in 1986, is still probably her best-known work. That fantasia on the oppression of fertility showed her talent in the area of science fiction, displayed again in The Blind Assassin. The pulp fantasies made up by the nameless hero of Laura's book belong to a disreputable genre, but they are far the most concentrated and resourceful narratives on offer here. </p> <p>The title of the book - both the one we hold in our hands, and the one that Iris had published after Laura's death - comes from one of his improvised serials, about a planet where children are forced to make carpets until they lose their sight. Then they are recruited as silent killers. </p> <p>One blind assassin, though, falls in love with the sacrificial virgin he has been sent, as part of a planned coup d'\u00e9tat, to kill. She has had her tongue cut out, as tradition demands, so that she can't disfigure the ritual of her sacrifice with comments of any kind. The heroine of the story-within-a-story finds this tale harsh, although it is an exaggerated account of her own plight, and her lover's: ours also is a planet where the poor are sacrificed to the rich, and where the system continues to find uses for those it has destroyed. </p> <p>When she asks for a happy story, she gets a story about the impossibility of happiness instead. He tells her about two battle-weary fighters who find themselves on a planet where all their needs are taken care of, by the doting Peach Women of Aa'A, women who grow on trees, on a stem running into the top of their heads, 'picked when ripe by their predecessors'. The moral of the story is that a paradise that you can't get out of can only be hell. </p> <p>The other parts of Laura's book are less persuasive; it's easier to imagine such a book making a local scandal at the time of publication, with its relative frankness and society-girl author, than being quoted 50 years later. </p> <p>John Updike has commented on the drawback of multiple time-schemes, multiple narratives in general, the way they lessen the momentum of the whole. A further drawback in the case of The Blind Assassin is that the story's eventful period, all the muted melodrama of abortions and asylums, runs from the mid-Thirties to Laura's suicide 10 years later, while the novel's expansive scheme requires the author to do a lot of filling in. Iris's memoirs, written in the 1990s, contain much philosophical reflection that seems to mark time: 'You want the truth, of course. You want me to put two and two together. But two and two doesn't necessarily get you the truth. Two and two equals a voice outside the window. Two and two equals the wind.' </p> <p>The truth that emerges is, in fact, eminently neat, in a murder-mystery sort of way. The surprises have the effect of further flattening out the characters, the villains becoming blacker, the martyrs yet more devoted. More of a grey area would be welcome. The demands of Atwood's tricksy plot have produced a curiously reactionary world picture, in which men have political convictions, while women's lives contain nothing more serious than love. </p> <p>With three researchers working for her, Atwood has come up with plenty of background about labour relations in Canada between the wars, but the political elements of the book never seem more than cladding bolted on to the romantic tale. He so dark, sarcastic and righteous, she so vulnerable in her youth and lovely gown.</p>",
  "Britain is playing a key role in developing lethal fungi that could be sprayed over countries illicitly growing cannabis, opium and coca plants, destroying their drug crops, secret US government documents have revealed. <p>Critics have described the programme as 'biological warfare' and likened it to the disastrous use of Agent Orange by the US in Vietnam. They warn the fungi will kill food crops, destroy the environment and endanger human life while having little impact on the world drug trade, which will simply move production elsewhere.</p> <p>US State Department documents obtained by The Observer name British scientist Michael Greaves as a key player in its programme to spray a fungus known as Fusarium oxysporum over Columbia's rainforests in the hope of destroying it coca crops - the source of 80 per cent of the world's cocaine. Until recently Greaves worked for the government-funded Institute of Arable Crop Research in Bristol. He is also the co-ordinator of a secretive UK-funded research project located in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan. This is developing another type of fungus aimed at wiping out opium poppies in places such as Afghanistan, where half the world's heroin comes from. </p> <p>The programme is based at the Institute of Genetics in Uzbekistan and run by many scientists who used to work on the Soviet germ warfare programme during the Cold War. The Foreign Office has provided pounds 100,000 of funding for the project, set up in 1998 under the United Nations Drug Control Programme.</p> <p>In 1999 three scientists from the Uzbekistan Institute came to the Long Ashton research centre in Bristol where Greaves was based. UN documents confirm that since the project began it has been extended to look at fungi to kill cannabis plants. The documents also reveal that, despite widespread concerns from environmentalists and scientists, this fungus has already been field-tested in three Central Asian states: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Two other states, Kazakstan and Turkmenistan, have so far refused. </p> <p>Disclosure of the extent of British involvement in what some see as 'biological warfare' in breach of the global Biological Weapons Convention will be highly embarrassing for the government. Only last week Cabinet Minister Mo Mowlam was in Colombia voicing opposition to the use of biological agents there. International criticism of the US plan to use the fungus, dubbed Agent Green, has forced President Bill Clinton to backtrack from tying aid to Colombia with spraying of the fungus. The US government has not wanted to be seen as the initiator of this programme and persuaded the UN Drug Control Programme to take responsibility. But the US and UK are the main sources of finance for the multi-million-pound programme.</p> <p>US State Department documents, signed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, urge the UNDCP to set up testing for 'large-scale implementation' of fusarium on coca in Colombia and to get other countries involved 'in order to avoid a perception that this is solely a US government initiative'.</p> <p> The documents say: 'We would urge the formulation of the UN project to take advantage of the extensive US research using fusarium to target illicit coca Dr Mike Greaves of the UK has already evaluated the host range and exploration data the US has developed.' </p> <p>The fungi work by secreting toxins into a plant's roots, forcing the coca plant or opium poppy to wilt and eventually die. But these fungi can survive in the soil for years and some scientists believe they could be toxic to humans and animals. There is also concern that they spread rapidly, mutate and kill other crops.</p> <p> In Peru in the late Eighties, after an epidemic of fusarium wilt in a coca-growing area caused by this fungus, thousands of peasant families could not grow food. Indeed, a proposal to use the fungus against cannabis crops in Florida was postponed after the state's department of environmental protection warned 'it is difficult, if not impossible, to control the spread of fusarium species. The mutated fungi can cause disease in a large number of crops, including tomatoes, peppers, corn and vines.'</p> <p> Jenny Tonge, the Liberal Democrats' international development spokesman, said: 'Under no circumstances should the UK support these initiatives. They will damage people, rainforests, and pollute the land. Past experience shows that drug production will just move elsewhere. It is time the West looked at how they can curb the demand for drugs from their citizens.' </p> <p>A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'There is nothing secret about the project. The UNDCP is seeking safe crop-eradication techniques. This project could lead to a major breakthrough in this field. But these are early days of the project, and much careful, lengthy research is still required.' The Observer was unable to contact Greaves who, according to his wife, is in Uzbekistan.</p>",
  "Radical plans to make oil tanker supplies an 'essential service' so the Government can order drivers to deliver fuel are being considered by Ministers. <p>Jack Straw's task force, put in place after the oil dispute last week, will discuss the proposals tomorrow. If agreed, legislation would be necessary to ensure the Government had powers to make it a criminal offence to refuse to deliver fuel. </p> <p>Tankers could also be commandeered by the Government to ensure supplies, particularly to the health service, firefighters and police. 'We must never again find ourselves in the position where 2,000 protesters can hold the country to ransom,' a Downing Street source said yesterday. 'Fuel deliveries must be maintained.' </p> <p>The Essential Services Act would also apply to water, gas and other key public services in private hands which would cause huge problems if they were blockaded. </p> <p>News of the plans came as opinion polls suggested Labour has been badly damaged by its handling of the crisis. One poll, carried out by Mori, showed the Tories ahead by two points, the first time they have enjoyed a lead for eight years. Another poll, by NOP, showed the parties neck and neck. </p> <p>The Government has been struck by the number of 'pinch points' in the country - the limited number of outlets for vital services which could be targeted easily. They will now look at drawing up easy-to-follow command structures for all the services after the complexities of the oil industry left Ministers baffled. </p> <p>Although emergency powers already in place allow the Government to use the Army to deliver fuel, that gives them access to only 80 tankers, a fraction of the number needed to keep Britain functioning. Downing Street also pointed out that the Army needs the tanker drivers for their own operations and so they would not all be available. </p> <p>Blair has demanded rapid action. The protesters have said the Government has 60 days to reduce the tax on fuel or face another wave of blockades. The Prime Minister has told colleagues he felt powerless to act when drivers refused to cross picket lines because they felt intimidated. </p> <p>Parliament returns from its summer recess at the end of October. Emergency legislation would have to be rushed through to ensure it was in place before the 60-day deadline and before Gordon Brown's pre-Budget statement in November, his first chance to respond officially to the fuel tax issue. </p> <p>Yesterday the Chancellor sent his clearest message yet that he was 'not minded' to cut tax on fuel. He said Ministers would be visiting public services to make it clear there was a direct link between a cut in the price of fuel and a cut in the amount of money the Government could spend on hospitals and schools. </p> <p>Government sources made it clear Brown felt such a cut would be counter-productive: '2p off a litre of petrol would cost us \u00a31 billion,' an official said. 'That would only give drivers a saving of \u00a32 a month.' </p> <p>As the country gets back to normal this weekend, the finger of blame for last week was starting to hover over Stephen Byers, the Trade and Industry Secretary. As the man in charge of energy policy, questions are being asked about why he didn't warn No 10 earlier about the dangers of fuel running out within 48 hours. A ministerial source told The Observer that Blair and Brown now regard Byers's career as 'irrevocably damaged'. </p> <p>'Numbers 10 and 11 Downing Street blame him. He should have got the oil companies doing more last weekend,' said the source. </p> <p>Petrol stations were getting back to something resembling normality this weekend. Although there were still long queues and rationing, the main suppliers said about 50 per cent of their garages were now open. It will be 10 to 12 days before all the stations are 'approaching normality'. </p> <p>The health service is also now back to normal with fuel deliveries now being aimed at non-essential users. </p> <p>Although some hardline protesters tried to keep the dispute going yesterday, they had little success. Police said that a slow-moving convoy of around 30 lorries between Dumfries and Castle Douglas in south-west Scotland caused no traffic difficulties. </p> <p>Rhys Parry, who organised key blockades in South Wales, said the 60-day deadline still held. 'We are standing firm. If they don't cut the price we will be back out on the streets. No doubt,' he said. </p> <p>There were some indication that public opinion was shifting yesterday. The majority of callers to a BBC radio poll branded the protesters 'selfish'.</p>",
  "At his third emergency press conference in Downing Street in as many days, a fret-lined Tony Blair was asked what lessons he had learned from the most critical week of his premiership. The Prime Minister looked dazed and sounded confused. Like a man who has come within a centimetre of losing his life in a car wreck, it will take time for it all to sink in. His mind will be replaying and freeze-framing these past seven days for the rest of his career. Weeks, months, even years later, I suspect sweat-drenched nightmares will wake him with a start in the dark reaches of the night. <p>One big and terribly frightening lesson is that modern society is a fuel tank away from anarchy. A motley bunch of tax vigilantes composed of farmers and truckers can press their thumbs on the national windpipe and have the entire country gasping for breath. If that is a disturbing thought for everybody, it is an absolutely petrifying one for any government, and especially for a leader who has invested so much emphasis on being in control. The bleakest moment inside Number 10, so I hear from within the bunker, was on Wednesday morning. Tony Blair's premiership was 48 hours away from meltdown. His jut-jawed pledge of the previous afternoon that the tankers would roll was not being fulfilled. One of the non-leaders of the protesters gloated: 'The Government is hanging by a thread.' </p> <p>That is what the Government thought, too. Some people were going to start dying; many people would soon have been without food. Gales of relief gusted down Whitehall when the protesters voluntarily packed up, even though it allowed them to claim a 'moral' victory over the Prime Minister. </p> <p>The obvious, practical lessons - that there should be fuel reserves for essential services and the police should never again respond with such mysterious lethargy - will be implemented by the Home Secretary's Task Force. Procedures for handling this sort of emergency will be brushed up. </p> <p>The Prime Minister, preoccupied with Sierra Leone last weekend, was not alone in being slow to see the dangers posed by the mutiny of Sierra Man. It was only on Monday evening, when he faced the grim prospect of an all-night confinement in a Chinese restaurant in Hull with John Prescott, that Tony Blair began to grasp the scale of the threat. One reason that the Government was caught with its collective pants around its ankles is because there are now very few people in Whitehall, either among the politicians or the civil servants, who have experience of dealing with national crises. The Three Day Week and the Winter of Discontent are sepia memories of the Seventies, which New Labour thought, as did we all, were time-locked in a basement archive. </p> <p>Blair's basic instinct not to give way to blackmail was right in principle. A democracy cannot be held to ransom by a couple of thousand self-described nobodies whipped up by right-wing newspapers. Pay the Danegeld once and you will never be rid of the Dane. Had he given way, then fox-hunters and every other loud and self-interested minority with a grudge against the Government would soon be picketing fuel supplies. Nor, as the plunge in the standing of Lionel Jospin in France demonstrates, do populist quick fixes win long-term respect. </p> <p>At the moment of crisis, Blair chose to do the firm thing rather than the populist thing, saying he would not be bullied by barricades. Yet, by the end of the week, he had switched back into I-feel-your-pain mode, telling the very people he had earlier accused of intimidation that he empathised with their 'genuine and sincere grievances'. New Labour has been presented with the hazards of the populism which it has so often pandered to. Tony Blair has prided himself on his ability to read public emotion and shape his government to the contours of national sentiment. This is an unreliable compass for governing, and it becomes a hopeless one when the public mood turns schizophrenic. How to explain the fact that the public were overwhelmingly on the side of the very blockaders who were making the nation's life a misery? It simply confounded the mood maestros of New Labour. </p> <p>One conclusion that Mr Blair can immediately draw is that the Government will never be everyone's friend. There is a slice of Britain, small and unrepresentative, but noisy and potentially dangerous, that will not be reconciled to a Labour government in any circumstances. At root, they do not believe that Labour has a right to rule. It is an offence against what they regard as the divine order. Margaret Beckett correctly identifies them as a group with a visceral hatred for the very idea that there should be a Labour government and they loathe Tony Blair all the more poisonously for being successful. In the absence of a credible electoral threat from William Hague's Conservatives, who have again looked like spectators rather than players, this Militant Tendency of the Right will take the direct action they condemned when it was practised by the Left. </p> <p>They will be cheered to the brink of lawlessness by elements of the media. The fickleness of the right-wing tabloids, which New Labour has devoted so much attention to wooing, has once again been demonstrated. Mob rule that they condemned when unleashed in France was egged on by the yellow press when it was practised this side of the English Channel. </p> <p>Big business, another constituency which New Labour has courted so assiduously, has also been exposed as a most unreliable ally in a crisis. The frustration with the fuel companies expressed by Ministers in public was the cleaned-up, expletive-deleted version of their private, spitting fury with the executives of Big Oil. </p> <p>Complicity with the protesters is almost impossible to prove, but there certainly was an extraordinary lack of energy in the response of the oil companies. Head-banging disbelief in Downing Street greeted Esso's announcement that they were putting up their pump prices just as the protests were dissolving. These people clearly attended the Slobodan Milosevic School of Public Relations. </p> <p>The trades unions, so long treated by New Labour as the sort of embarrassing relative who farts at weddings, did prove to be a friend in need, not just rhetorically, but also practically. There were detailed private conversations between Downing Street and the TGWU, which made great efforts to persuade the tanker drivers to resume deliveries. </p> <p>The largest lesson of this so-called People's Protest whipped up by self-appointed People's Papers against the self-styled People's Prime Minister is about the limitations of trying to appease the people. The Government has lost the debate about energy taxes because it never dared to make the arguments with conviction. Ministers could - but rarely have - argued for higher petrol duties on environmental grounds. Within New Labour, it is believed that being green is for wimps. </p> <p>They could tell the people - but are scared to confront them with this awkward truth - that they cannot clamour for better schools and hospitals one week and then protest about higher taxes the next week. The Government might - but it has yet to be this frank with the electorate - point out to Middle Britain that its aversion to paying more in income tax inevitably means that revenues will have to be raised by other means. </p> <p>Tony Blair, a Prime Minister often at his best in a crisis, correctly stood straight in the face of the fuel blackmailers. If he is looking for just one big lesson to learn, then it is that he should locate his backbone more often.</p>",
  "'So,' successive interviewers triumphantly put to Ministers, 'you didn't see it coming. Why didn't you anticipate what would happen?' The truth is that nobody in a London-centred political and media world saw the scale of what was coming - even if in the north of England and Scotland last weekend word was spreading fast that you had better fill your tank. As for the idea that by last Wednesday the country would face breakdown - not even the protesters expected such a devastating result so soon. We were all blindsided. <p>What had not been appreciated was the fragility of an economy made extraordinarily interdependent because so many organisations carry astonishingly few reserves. Rather than tie up money in carrying 'dead' stock, supermarkets and petrol stations rely on a system of 'just-in-time' delivery - depending on daily and sometimes even more frequent deliveries to keep their shelves and underground tanks stocked. Fine if the lorries and tankers keep on coming. Disastrous if they don't for two or three days. </p> <p>This alone would not have been enough to create a national crisis; after all, Britain has some 50 oil supply depots, and not even the miners succeeded in picketing them effectively. Here the lesson is that old organisational forms have been succeeded by a new conception: the network. Intellectuals theorising about the impact of information technology have been arguing for some years that the office and factory are giving way to the network as the new prime organisational form. The mobile telephone and internet underpin a new capacity to communicate that make all organisations more porous; and individuals can coalesce around common aims while never actually meeting. One in 17 British workers now 'teleworks' from home. One in 10 Londoners works as a free agent. </p> <p>There have been warnings over the emergence of networks as the new organisational force. The police found they could not trace the email and website-linked network behind the J18 rioters in the City last year. But nobody imagined a group of farmers, road hauliers and taxi drivers could deploy networking capacity to such destructive effect. Brynle Williams, the Welsh farmer who led the trigger protest at Stanlow, acknowledged he was not part of a national campaigning organisation, but 'a network of like-minded people'. </p> <p>It is this dimension of the crisis with which the Government's task force, led by Jack Straw, must wrestle if it is to counteract a second blockade. The authorities are not confronting members of a body like the National Union of Mineworkers whose phones can be tapped, communications monitored and movements watched. They are confronting a network whose co-ordinating centre is constantly changing and linked by a myriad of mobile phones, CB radios, in-cab fax machines and laptops . </p> <p>So, just-in-time delivery and the network - two new organisational forms - interacted to produce a very 21st- century crisis which will require completely new thinking to manage if it recurs. Once it became clear on Monday morning that the blockades were proving so effective, the network was able to mobilise sympathisers in the rest of the country, so by Monday afternoon the oil companies were issuing warnings that petrol stations would run dry. That, in turn, prompted the panic buying, emptying petrol stations even faster. It was a frightening, almost surreal lurch from normality to disaster in 24 hours. </p> <p>Yet the protest was largely peaceful. Some 2,000 protesters could only request tanker drivers to stop, in order to argue their case, if the drivers had pre-agreed to show their manifests, demonstrating that they were going to deliver to emergency services. When they did stop, the protesters could exercise a right of veto over who and what constituted an emergency service, one of the ugliest dimensions of the crisis. But if the drivers refused to comply with the request, they were free to come and go. One of the more perplexing aspects of the crisis was why that right was not exercised; after all, tankers and lorries had moved through NUM and Wapping picket lines in the 1980s. Why were the drivers so reluctant in 2000? </p> <p>Part of the explanation is a genuine fear of intimidation, with threats to put offending drivers' pictures on the internet. But by far the most important explanation is that the oil companies have contracted out their petrol delivery to low-cost independent road hauliers who sympathised with the protesters' cause and over whom the oil companies had little leverage. They weren't prepared to take any risks, and offered no loyalty because no reciprocal loyalty had been displayed by the companies in their ceaseless drive for cost minimisation. Some drivers had even been sacked to be re-employed as independents for less pay. </p> <p>In other words, the new mania to maximise shareholder value above any other strategic corporate objective has exposed the whole delivery and supply system to the kind of shock the country experienced last week. If the Government wants more protection against a repeat, it will need to calm down the British corporate sectors' increasing preoccupation with profit and self-interest. </p> <p> There is the issue of how debate and protest are to be handled in an information age in which the electorate is better educated, more articulate and insistent on having its voice heard than ever before - and where trust in old forms of governance is declining. Here there were ominous parallels with the way the public reacted to the News of the World 's name-and-shame paedophiles campaign. Not trusting the Government to act and barely understanding the complexities, we witnessed the return of vigilante justice. </p> <p>The background to the blockade has been a similar, over-the-top campaign by the Sun and Daily Mail - 'Dump the Pump' - in which the Government has been made to look a fool and knave over its allegedly uncaring attitude to Britain's high taxes on fuel. That taxes overall are low, that there are no road tolls and that there is a democratic process by which taxes are determined has been neglected. There must be action on the streets. 'Dump the Pump' may have been a flop, but there is little doubt that the degree of tacit support the protesters received was helped by the widespread view, entrenched by the campaign, that fuel taxes are illegitimately too high. If the Government is not 'listening', i.e. caving in, then anybody has the right to act as they see fit. It is the road to anarchy. </p> <p>But the Government has helped create this situation by its own unwillingness to lead. New Labour has not wanted to argue that taxation is the platform for the expenditure the electorate wants. </p> <p>Last week it received its comeuppance. It was right to resist being held to ransom, but if it wants to avoid a repeat it will have to do more than put the police in sooner and more aggressively.</p>",

No one will think the worse of you.' </p> <p>He was Brynle Williams, 51, from nearby Cilcain, a farmer's union activist who runs a 200-acre farm and gets up at dawn to feed his cattle and sheep. His father's father was a farmer. His first language is Welsh. He was about to bring Britain to a shuddering halt. </p> <p>Around him were faces full of determination and others full of doubt. Not all were sure they were prepared to leave, within hours, to blockade Britain's largest oil refinery. Yet, despite his ultimatum, no one moved. </p> <p>Williams looked round, nodded slowly and then spelled out the gravity of the task. They would be fighting the Government, he said, not just a company. They would need the whole of the country behind them. To do that they must concentrate on just one issue. Forget BSE and the low price of milk, they were farmers' issues, Williams said. Petrol was the issue. </p> <p>The men formed a convoy, drove out of the village and headed, as dusk fell, for the Stanlow oil refinery. Few of them knew exactly what they were going to do or why. All they knew was they wanted something to change. </p> <p>Within days, Williams and his motley alliance of farmers, hauliers and fishermen were wreaking havoc throughout the nation. At the peak of the crisis on Wednesday they were calling the shots. The Government appeared powerless to do anything to stop them. A dozen reluctant activists - backed by no unions, no shadowy multimillionaires, no foreign governments and whose organisation, such as it was, didn't even have headed notepaper - were making demands on the Prime Minister. And he had to listen. </p> <p>Now the immediate crisis is over but the questions remain. How did Williams and his men do it? Can they do it again? And, if they don't, who else will? Who will be next to hold Britain to ransom? </p> <p>It seemed to come from nowhere, a sudden spasm prompted by the success of French protesters in forcing their government to make concessions over fuel taxes. But in fact it had been brewing for months or even - for farmers and hauliers - for years. After successive disasters in the beef, pig and dairy industries, high fuel prices had hit farmers hard. Hauliers too found their profits, once substantial, cut to the bone. </p> <p>The rise was stoked in part by intense market speculation on a worldwide fuel shortage and partly by the refusal of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) to increase supply. With the price of a barrel of crude at a 10-year high the oil companies have passed the rise on to their customers on the forecourts. </p> <p>Calls for a cut in taxes to lessen the rises have been ignored, despite Britain having the highest fuel levies in Europe. Farmers tipping hundreds of gallons of milk on to fields and wildcat pickets of supermarkets to protest at foreign imports have barely made the local papers. A campaign last month to 'Dump The Pump' with a consumer boycott flopped in the face of public apathy. Then came the French blockade as lorry drivers cut off ports in a bid to force their government to cut taxes on fuel. The French government backed down. </p> <p>For men like Williams the lessons were obvious. The soft approach does not work, direct action does. On 4 September Welsh farmers and hauliers, including the top men from the FFA (Farmers for Action UK - a loose union of activists), met with leading politicians in Wales to talk about the crises in their industry. The meeting, in the market town of Ruthin, was inconclusive. The farmers and drivers felt their concerns were being ignored. Farmer Andrew Spence, as the FFA's regional co-ordinator for the North-East, was called by his counterpart in Cheshire and told a protest was going to be organised. Spence reached for his phone and made the first of several hundred calls. </p> <p>At 5.55am last Saturday, BA Flight 34 from Kuala Lumpur arrived at Heathrow's Terminal 4. On board was Richard Caborn, junior Minister at the Department for Trade and Industry. He drove up the M1 towards his Sheffield constituency and opened his ministerial red box. The first thing he saw, typed by his DTI civil servants, was a report on Britain's fuel crisis. </p> <p>The best case scenario, it said, was that the protests would peter out after a few ministerial pronouncements on Government willingness to listen and emphasis of the fact that fuel prices were dependent on the price of crude. In the worst case petrol stations would be shut within a week and there would be chaos. Caborn saw that there was a meeting of the Privy Council at Balmoral Castle on Monday to request emergency powers from the Queen. That was unusual, but no one in Government really believed the powers would be needed. </p> <p>Yet most people in Britain were beginning to realise something extraordinary was happening. Many viewed the pictures of hundreds of trucks blocking motorways with an odd exhilaration. There had already been two arrests and it looked like there would be more. The spectre of the 1984 miners' strike loomed large. </p> <p>This time, however, it was non-political. This was a movement - instinctive, emotional and irrational - of rural working people, small businessmen and even angry housewives, alienated by what they saw as an urban, cosmopolitan, bourgeois, distant government. Williams told The Observer the protest was not political: 'At the last general election I didn't vote. With an incoming Labour government I expected they would do more to help agriculture. But they didn't. Mr Blair has got to take stock of what the community is saying. The way he behaved in Wales with Rhodri Morgan and with the old leader of the GLC, Livingstone, makes one wonder whether he is getting a little out of touch. But I don't want to get political.' </p> <p>Even as Caborn drove up the M1, petrol stations at his destination were running out of fuel. Tanker drivers at four refineries and depots were unable, or unwilling, to take their trucks out. By that afternoon the first filling stations - in Scotland - had run out. </p> <p>What the Cabinet did not realise was the speed with which the protesters - who never numbered more than 2,500 and were led by fewer than a dozen men - could paralyse the country. Jack Straw's excuse this weekend was that it had never been done before. It hasn't. Everyone, not least the protesters, was caught by surprise. </p> <p>Using its network of regional organisers, the FFA co-ordinated lightning raids on refineries and depots across the country. Backed up by the hauliers, convoys would form, usually on a stretch of open motorway, between 10 and 15 miles from a mutually agreed target, and then descend on it. </p> <p>The blockaders were careful to stay, in the main, law-abiding. Cases of genuine harassment were rare. Though there were instances of intimidation, police say they have recorded no official complaints. At Fawley refinery near Southampton and Stanlow itself protesters and drivers chatted and shared cups of tea through the chain-link fences. Relations with the police were good. Negotiations to allow through fuel for emergency services were conducted amicably. </p> <p>But even though the routes to and from the gates were always left open - to avoid breaking the law - the pickets still formed an effective barrier. Tanker drivers seeking to leave were stopped and the drivers 'talked to' by the protesters. Most turned back, often with the support of their employers. Usually one tanker leaves the massive BP refinery in Coryton every three minutes. During the protest only one an hour got out. And they were carrying fuel for the emergency services alone. The 'blockade' consisted of about 30 protesters and eight lorries parked near a roundabout at the site entrance. </p> <p>The tanker drivers were largely on the protesters' side. 'We are in the same boat. Everyone suffers from high fuel prices,' said Chris McNamara, a London haulier. Even without that incentive, the close-knit community in which truckers live would ensure none of its members would cross a picket manned by friends and colleagues. 'At the end of the day, when this is all over, they knew they would have to share the road with us afterwards,' said John Gamble, a haulier who protested in southern England. </p> <p>The secret of success was keeping it simple. In these tight-knit professions news spreads fast. Many of the farmers were childhood friends whose families were neighbours for generations. They meet weekly in pubs, at auctions or at town meetings. Paul Ashley and Tom Houghton, the two Cheshire farmers who provided the crucial link between the agricultural community and the truckers, are very close. Houghton manages the Ashley family farm. At the Stanlow blockade they were always together. 'They are practically joined at the hip,' said one farmer. </p> <p>Mobile phones played a key part. Co-ordinating much of the protest was FFA chairman David Handley, and Williams. They ran an informal but effective 'bush telegraph'. Anyone they contacted had the numbers of a dozen other FFA supporters. And they would each have a dozen more. A single call could mobilise hundreds of people within an hour. </p> <p>Some farmers found the old ways worked best. FFA South Wales organiser, Rhys Parry, who ordered blockades throughout his region and put together a convoy encircling the Welsh Assembly in Cardiff, used word-of-mouth at livestock markets. He told The Observer: 'Farmers are the biggest gossips in the world and there is a market every day somewhere. You would just find a couple of the lads going down to one and then give them some instructions to pass on.' </p> <p>Though not as organised as the farmers, the truckers' protests and roadblocks also quickly spread. Before the sun had risen on Wednesday four columns of trucks were heading from different directions towards the capital. The first the police knew of it was when they saw the convoys crawling at 15mph, lights flashing, on CCTV cameras on motorway bridges. </p> <p>Steve Kelly was one of the organisers. He said a handful of drivers working London routes had been talking about the crisis and simply decided to act. A ring-round of colleagues took just two-and -a-half hours the next morning. The rendezvous was at 5am. By 7am they were half way into the capital. </p> <p>That evening rolling roadblocks hit roads across the UK. With refinery and depot protests still holding firm, farmers and hauliers had made a mockery of Blair's pledge - just a day earlier - to resolve the situation within 24 hours. The Government had been unable to halt the slide towards chaos. </p> <p>When Blair stood up in the State Dining Room at Downing Street on Tuesday afternoon to give that pledge in his first Prime Ministerial address to the nation, it was a blunder. He believed the oil executives would get the tankers moving. But he was wrong. </p> <p>Everything got worse. By Wednesday evening most of the tankers still hadn't budged. The reason, as far as anyone can make out, was that the tanker drivers didn't feel like driving 30,000 litres of inflammable fuel through a demonstration and out on the open roads. And the oil companies appeared to be less than keen on forcing them to. </p> <p>To many it seemed incredible that the powerful oil executives could not get their drivers to do as they asked. Critics pointed out that sending staff to work in risky environments is not exactly new to people like Shell or BP. </p> <p>Government sources briefed privately that they felt the oil companies were not pulling their weight. No one went as far as to allege conspiracy or collusion but a certain 'identity of interests' was pointed out. Pictures of protesters served with refreshments by oil companies or using their facilities only strengthened the suspicions. </p> <p>Such allegations have been fiercely denied by the oil industry. It claims it just wants to 'sell petrol'. That, however, is slightly disingenuous. Most of the oil companies' cash comes from the sale of crude oil, not finished fuel. Analysts say the companies break even when oil is $13 a barrel. When it is at $30 they make a killing. </p> <p>And while motorists pay for higher oil prices, the oil company executives have done very well. Sir John Browne, chief executive of BP, is paid \u00a31.45m each year. Thanks to soaring oil prices, BP's share price has rocketed. With 900,000 shares himself, Browne has made, on paper at least, about \u00a32m. Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Shell, owns 500,000 shares in Shell. They too have jumped in value. </p> <p>High oil prices have meant bumper profits for the companies too. In the first six months of this year BP made an incredible \u00a35.6bn - \u00a3215m per week, \u00a330m a day or \u00a33,800 a second. These are the largest ever profits made by a British corporation. BP is on track to be the first British company to make more than \u00a310bn in one financial year. </p> <p>The five oil companies who dominate world trade will make, analysts say, profits this year of around \u00a335bn. Of course, the companies say their profits from forecourt sales are tiny - just 1p in every litre. The Government's tax take is 61p. </p> <p>As most of the industry's profits come from crude oil production, some have suggested a windfall tax on that. But when Gordon Brown suggested reviewing the tax regime governing the North Sea oil industry, one of the most lenient in the world, the oil giants threatened to pull out of the North Sea, resulting in thousands of job losses. The Chancellor quietly backed off. </p> <p>Campaigners, particularly from environmental groups, point out that Lord Simon, BP's former chief executive, was a Trade Minister. BP has also seconded several employees to the Treasury, Foreign Office and DTI to help the Government with its policy formulation. The company's directors serve on a number of Government task forces. Such intimacy with the administration, campaigners say, makes a run-in with government unlikely. </p> <p>A series of misjudgments dogged the Government through the early part of the week. Blair had spent the weekend at Chequers. Most of his time was taken up dealing with the raid to free British soldiers held by rebels in Sierra Leone. Fuel took second place. </p> <p>By Sunday evening he was back at Downing Street and working in his flat. There he got a fuller briefing on what Williams, Ashley and the others had achieved. Up to 100 petrol stations had run dry, he was told. Farmers were planning to dump bales of straw in front of the Stanlow refinery. Hauliers said that up to 80 rolling roadblocks would strike in the morning. </p> <p>At 8am on Monday he phoned Jack Straw who had arrived back at his London home just an hour earlier after a long journey back from a terrorism meeting in India. Determined to get his head down for a few hours, Straw set the alarm for 11am and went to sleep. </p> <p>His daughter took the call from the Prime Minister. 'I'm afraid you'll have to get up, Dad - it's Tony Blair on the telephone,' she said. </p> <p>Blair said it was time to put crisis machinery in gear, not least to show the Government meant business. The excitement over the Sierra Leone operation had faded and a decision by Opec to pump more oil had had no impact. Action was needed. </p> <p>Straw went to work. The Home Secretary convened the Civil Contingencies Committee in the Cabinet Office Briefing Room under Downing Street. As they started their discussions, Richard Caborn had arrived at Balmoral. He was ushered into see the Queen, who agreed her Government's request for emergency powers. </p> <p>In London Blair wanted to maintain an air of calm. Cancelling engagements would only fuel panic, so he travelled to Loughborough to launch new e-commerce policies. That afternoon, in shirt sleeves in a manor house hotel, he chatted with journalists. He inserted a line into his speech making it clear the Government would not be bullied. 'We cannot and we will not alter Government policy on petrol through blockades and pickets,' he said. </p> <p>A media campaign, fronted by Stephen Byers, the Trade and Industry Secretary, was launched to convince the public of the Government position. But the public didn't want to be convinced. And the fuel was running out more quickly than anyone seemed to realise. </p> <p>Straw called in Sir John Evans, Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall police, who agreed to use the police's National Reporting Centre to co-ordinate the operation to get tankers rolling again. The centre has three states of alert. Gold, silver and bronze. They went immediately to gold. </p> <p>That evening Blair was advised by Hull police not to attend John Prescott's celebration of 30 years in parliament at Mr Chu's Chinese restaurant in Hull. But still, with the crisis team in place and the oil executives seemingly aware of the seriousness of the issue, Tuesday dawned with Blair believing he had things under control. That was when he made his ill-fated 24-hour pledge. </p> <p>A day later, as his deadline grew close, Britain was running dry. The post was hit. Stricken firms were beginning to lay off staff . William Hague demanded the immediate recall of Parliament. </p> <p>Blair started playing hardball. Denouncing the protesters for doing 'real damage to real people', he put the NHS on red alert. 'Lives are at risk if these people cannot get to work,' he said. </p> <p>The situation looked bleak. On Wednesday morning an incredulous country woke to hear the army was being mobilised. Funeral directors said they only had petrol to pick up bodies from houses, not bury them. Ambulance services imposed speed limits. Supermarkets started running out of food. Castastrophe seemed imminent. </p> <p>But it didn't happen. The country woke to another day of madness on Thursday - then, suddenly, it was over. The shortages remained - and are likely to remain for up to two weeks - but the blockades were gone. At 5am Brynle Williams stood on the back of a trailer in the cool, grey dawn and announced the end of the Stanlow blockade. Half an hour later Scottish protesters at Grangemouth voted to lift their blockade. Crucial negotiations by senior trade unionists had been key in securing their decision. Within minutes the first tankers left the refinery and headed for petrol stations. </p> <p>At 8am the protest at Avonmouth ended. A convoy of eight tankers left the plant with the drivers waving at the cheering demonstrators. By mid-morning the protests in Essex, Nottingham and Plymouth were over too. The protesters at the Conoco Ocean terminal in Lincolnshire ended their protest at 11am. </p> <p>Feelings were mixed. A rump of protesters at Fawley and Jarrow rejected the FFA's decision. At Trafford in Manchester one of the main organisers, Dave Neave, a farmer from Rochdale, broke down in tears of frustration. </p> <p>All over the country the protests unravelled. There was a last sting in the tail when Esso and TotalFinaElf tried to raise prices by 2p a litre but they were forced to back down by a furious Blair. An odd calm settled. </p> <p>It is now officially over. Both sides are licking their wounds. The Government, mauled by public opinion and bruised by a week where it looked more out of touch and ineffectual than at any other time, seems chastened. And though the protesters know they caused mayhem in a way they had never dreamed possible, their basic demands are still unfulfilled. </p> <p>Yesterday Brown made it clear, yet again, that he would not be forced into hasty decisions. In November he will make his pre-budget statement. Until then there is an uneasy peace. </p> <p>Blair has set up a task force to stop the crisis recurring. Led by Straw, and involving the police and oil companies, it will examine ways of making tankers an 'essential service' with official powers to make them deliver fuel. It will also try to sort out chains of command so that when the government asks for action, it gets it. </p> <p>The analysis has started. Brown comes out of it well. He had the political and union connections which kept the trade unions onside and allowed the inside track dialogue which broke up the Grangemouth protest. His political baggage, in sharp contrast to Blair, came in useful. Yesterday Government sources said that any 'hints' about a cut in fuel tax were wide of the mark. Brown does not believe a cut is a priority. </p> <p>Byers will have a harder time. Why did the initial Government campaign seem so underpowered, despite his involvement? </p> <p>The environmental lobby has also lost out. The argument about high fuel prices being necessary to stop people using their cars has hardly been heard from any Minister. Fulfillment of Prescott's pledge to cut car use looks increasingly unlikely. </p> <p>Blair has clawed back a sort of victory from the chaos of mid-week. Labour advisers believe the 'defence of democracy' argument worked with voters, despite their dislike of high fuel taxes. Now Blair has to make the argument that higher taxes in some areas are the price that has to be paid for good public services. </p> <p>More broadly, how do the protests fit into the British tradition of dissent? Are Williams and his like right-wing radicals or long-suffering populist heroes - or both? </p> <p>Dr Rodney Barker, a political scientist at the London School of Economics, called the protests 'astonishing', not because of their use of direct action, but because the people on the picket lines were 'bosses'. 'Britain's small businessmen and independent farmers do not have a long tradition of radical protest,' he said. </p> <p>The closest historical parallel, Barker said, was the Luddite movement of the early Nineteenth Century when small artisans, put out of work by the Industrial Revolution, took to smashing machines in a bid to save their jobs. </p> <p>Dr Simon Szreter, a history lecturer at Cambridge University, said the support of the fuel protests was due to a growing dissatisfaction with modern British politics. 'There is a growing sense of disenfranchisement due to the closeness of the political parties and also a feeling that after three years of Labour rule not enough has changed. This has all put the credibility of the Government in serious danger,' Szreter said. </p> <p>With pessimistic analysts predicting fuel prices at more than $50 a barrel soon the problems are not going to go away. 'They just can't get their heads around this crisis, can they? They have no idea of the pressures that have forced ordinary people to take the sort of action we have,' Rhys Parry, the South Wales organiser for Farmers For Action, said yesterday. </p> <p>Brynle Williams is now aware, and in awe, of the power he has. 'I am totally and utterly overwhelmed. I had no idea it would end like this. We're very mild-mannered people.' Quite how mild-mannered remains to be seen.</p>",
  "It was a week of chaos. Emperors lost clothes; the mighty fell; certainties collapsed as authority failed, and every scape was goated. And that was only the press. <p>These petrol protests were spontaneous - they were not planned and they were not whipped up by the media, swore the Sun, the whipper-up-in-chief. </p> <p>Almost true, guv. Only one newspaper - Tony Blair's 'must-read' Daily Mail - seemed on top of unfolding events. </p> <p>It led eight days ago with the prescient question 'When will OUR petrol run dry?' - while the soaraway Bun was still obsessed by Big Brother. It timed its Thursday front-page appeal to the pickets with eerie brilliance. 'As a friend who believes in the justice of your cause, the Mail urges you to end your blockade, while you still hold the high ground.' Whereupon the lower ground emptied. </p> <p>More of the Mail in a moment. The fact remains that the media weren't so much leading this protest as stuck in a traffic jam at the back of a fuel queue. 'French-style fuel protest hits Britain,' said the Guardian. Did anyone realise what was to come? Three-day weeks relived? 'The oil blockades of French lorry drivers, however impressive, do not quite match up in industrial terms to the vice-like grip of 250,000 organised energy workers,' wrote Seumas Milne in the Guardian. </p> <p>But hang on, chaps! By Tuesday the 'Panic at the pumps' which had been somewhere on pages six or seven the day before, was suddenly stage centre. 'Great Petrol Revolt 2000' (the Sun ), 'Running on Empty', cried the Mail ; 'Showdown at the pumps,' said the Express. </p> <p>The reporting bit, was easy. Deciding what was going on, and why, proved more difficult. </p> <p>On the one hand, this picketing gambit had been nicked from the French truckers, and they had been roundly condemned by solemn columns around Britain. </p> <p>On the other hand, blockading had instant poll support from 90 per cent of the populace. </p> <p>The first rule of editorial survival is to find somebody to attack. </p> <p>The Mirror, somewhat oddly, singled out Blair, with a cruel front page on 'Two Jags Tony'. Don't be a 'fool on fuel', it warned him. 'It is not a sign of weakness to react to strong public feelings. That is democracy.' 'Please LISTEN, Prime Minister,' pleaded the Sun . Labour was insulated from reality by life in the kind of chauffeur-driven limos which editors never use. </p> <p>But who were these demonstrators? And why was the Conservative press having such a field day? Enter the Independent: 'The Government should ignore these futile protests from a ragtag mixture of the disaffected, including not just hauliers, fishermen and farmers, but also many Mr Indignants, motorists who have in common only the fact that they would like to drive more cheaply.' </p> <p>Who were the 10 per cent on the polls who didn't want lower-priced petrol, wondered Hugo Young in the Guardian. Probably the greener columnists of that paper and the Indy. But even there nothing was safe or agreed. </p> <p>Zoe Smith, of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, wrote a careful analysis saying that, yes, the 'highest petrol tax in Europe' was the Government's responsibility ('What government takes, government can return') and, no, none of this 'was very well targeted to protect the environment'. Anne McElvoy in the Indy said there was an election coming 'with an awful lot of irate drivers in key marginals, Sierra man will win in the end'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, secondary panic spread. The Sun was jabbering. 'Tony Blair is a decent and capable man - but if he has called this one wrong, his days may be numbered.' The Mirror was quivering. 'Enough is enough.' Anxiety for law and order masked the agon-ised and secretive meetings taking place all over Fleet Street trying to find a way of distributing papers in a world without diesel. </p> <p>Suddenly Tony was right. 'Common sense creeps in,' said the Guardian. And the oil firms set themselves up as the ones everybody could hate. Crisis over. But not, perhaps, memory of crisis. </p> <p>Was this rumbustious episode got up by the press? </p> <p>To believe that, you have to cast the Mail' s Paul Dacre as evil genius, and he has his defences ready - notably a leader before the protests really started which warned against 'the bloody-minded militancy that has plunged France into chaos' and told the protesters to 'leave their cause to the normal processes of democracy'. That isn't a complete defence. The Mail, having seen its advice ignored, rather relished picturing a 'smirking Gordon Brown' and interviewing the rebels 'of a very British blockade' in their deckchairs, 'talking of summer holidays, Radio 4 and how they feel Labour has betrayed them'. Incitement or reportage? </p> <p>At least the Mail knew what was happening before it happened and saw it ending when it did. At least Blair was warned. </p> <p>Does this mean that its subsequent lather about 'the unprecedented Europeanisation of British politics, now uncannily reminiscent of the elitist bureaucracy in France' is right, too? </p> <p>Pass on such old siren songs. The quieter lessons of tumult past are probably more salient. That when people see TV pictures of empty filling stations, they go and fill up. That a mobile phone and an email leaves Arthur Scargill for dead - and reporters out of the loop. That green, alas, will not be the colour of next year's Budget. And that a press which doesn't like a tough issue can always find softer ones. </p> <p>Thus the journals that were weaker on Wapping were ramrod here. Thus the lions of law and order licked their paws. Other boots, other feet; much kicking up of dust. </p> <p>But another power-crazed press plot against our elected masters? Give over - even if the Sun has suddenly found its bombastic voice again. This cacophony couldn't organise a sandwich supper in El Vino's.</p>",
  "<p>I decided to go to the Dome last weekend, to see what all the fuss was about. Or, rather, my wife decided to go, and one of the children said: 'stop grumbling about it'. </p> <p>The first thing to be said is that it is not a Dome: it is a tent. It is a dome-shaped tent. It is a kind of big top, ideal for a permanent circus (I am not referring to New Labour), with a small theme-park added on. But it is a theme-park without a theme. </p> <p>My grumble was that, on account of all the bad publicity, the place would be too crowded. It was a nice day, and it seemed pretty crowded. I was agreeably surprised by how nice it was outside, by the river, and by how much space there was for picnicking. The fairground atmosphere was quite fun. </p> <p>The 'show' was a great display of trapezes and acrobatics. Everybody seemed to be enjoying themselves, but my conclusion was that the organisers could only have achieved viable revenue figures by packing the place so much that they would have had a revolution on their hands. </p> <p>The theme of one area was the importance of the environment. One notice suggested that, if every car-owner in the country queued up for petrol at once, the pumps would run dry in about 20 minutes. </p> <p>I kept thinking of that notice all week, as the fuel protest got going and it was panic-stations at the filling stations. If the Tent's attendance figures were not large enough to provoke a revolution, there was certainly an odd sort of insurrection gathering outside. </p> <p>In common, I imagine, with many people, I was somewhat bemused by the way Tony Blair's little local difficulty with petrol protesters was reported and generally commented on. Words and phrases from the heavy industrial disputes of the 1970s and 1980s were used to describe demonstrations that appear to have been altogether more peaceful than the language implied. </p> <p>Many observers also seemed to miss the real point of what the oil companies were up to. The oil giants have spent years campaigning against higher taxes and duties on fuel. For them a peasants' revolt was just what the company doctor ordered. In the middle of the dispute, the Government issued statistics showing that the main reason for a benign inflation outcome in August was a fall in petrol prices - repeat, fall. </p> <p>What has been happening in the UK is intense price competition at the forecourt. Now the first law of business economics is that, however much they praise the virtues of competition, industrialists and businessmen don't like it. This competition at the retail end was squeezing the profit margins of the oil refineries. They wanted prices back up - as they indicated perhaps a little too hastily within minutes of the protesters' action being called off. The first law of all economics is that a sudden shortage doesn't half send prices up. </p> <p>It was fascinating to watch Labour's control freaks react to all this unexpected and unaccustomed pressure. (My Labour friends spent a lot of time on their summer holidays trying to think strategically, but they did not think of this one.) They could not react to undemocratic pressure; yet this was just the kind of populist pressure that seems a natural reaction to the world of television and presentational politics, in which Parliament - the very fount of the democratic process - has been treated with a certain contempt by Labour. </p> <p>Perhaps one of the good things to have come out of last week's events is that Labour has rediscovered the democratic process by which it was elected in the first place. Certainly, the word 'process' cropped up in all the television appearances by Blair's spokesmen - who tended, for some reason, to be nicely devolved secretaries of state for Scotland and Wales. </p> <p>A British prime minister could not give way weakly like, say, a French prime minister. But there was a Budget process. Implied in the voluntary cessation of the protest was the belief that there was an 'understanding' about the Government listening at Budget time. </p> <p>This was not an understanding that seemed to be shared by the Prime Minister's troublesome next-door neighbour, the King of Stealth Taxes, the Chancellor himself. The Chancellor went out of his way to indicate that he could not be pushed around like this. </p> <p>Stealth taxes are not what they were. The game of grandmother's footsteps has ended. Grandmother Brown has been rumbled. </p> <p>To be fair to the Chancellor, he resorted to stealth taxes - including increasing the rate at which fuel duties automatically rose in the Budget - only because Blair and the focus groups were not too keen on honest income taxes. It was the Economist that first reported that the resistance point had been reached on fuel duty; sure enough, while denying it at the time, the Treasury made clear in this year's Budget that the game was up. (Can this be the very same Economist that confidently told us a few years ago that world oil prices were going to fall to $5 a barrel and stay there? Ah well, win some, lose some.) </p> <p>As I pointed out last week, it is not wicked Opec but synchronised increases in world demand that have driven oil prices up. Simple economics suggests that if western governments were to cut fuel taxes, that would further increase the demand for fuel - and hence its price. The oil companies can't wait... </p> <p>Like the North Sea, these are deep waters.</p>",
  "Wearing a public mien of calm, on Monday 21 December, Peter Mandelson went down to Greenwich for an inspection tour of the Millennium Dome, which was soon interrupted by urgent instructions to talk to Downing Street. Back at No 10, Derry Irvine and Charlie Falconer, the lawyers of the Blair court, were brought into the discussions with Campbell about how to try to control the loan story. At this meeting, Jonathan Powell produced a note from Sir Richard Wilson. After talking to the DTI's Permanent Secretary Sir Michael Scholar, the Cabinet Secretary confirmed that Mandelson had been properly insulated from the DTI inquiries into Robinson. But both the civil servants also took the view - which Wilson conveyed to Blair - that for Mandelson to be so hugely and secretly indebted to the Paymaster-General was nevertheless 'a very big problem'. <p>On Monday afternoon, the Guardian formally approached Mandelson and Robinson for confirmation of the details of the loan. Into the placidity of the Christmas recess, a period usually devoid of big political events, the bomb detonated.</p> <p>A strangely unperturbed Mandelson convinced himself he could walk through the fire. Blair was instinctively and immediately doubtful that he could possibly survive what he and Campbell both knew would be an inferno. The press secretary briefed political correspondents that the Prime Minister did not regard it as 'a hanging offence', which fell far short of a ringing statement of confidence.</p> <p>For the next 24 hours, beginning with Monday's Newsnight, on which he declared, 'There is no conflict of interest so the question of resignation does not arise', Mandelson toured the TV and radio studios, determined to tough it out. As he told one friend: 'I've learnt from my personal life that you have to stand up to these fuckers. If they scent blood, they will come for the kill.'</p> <p>But the more Mandelson talked, the more questions were raised. Should he have declared the loan in the Register of Members' Interests? Had he revealed the loan to the Britannia Building Society when he applied for a mortgage? After a period of equivocation, Mandelson confessed that he had not. Wegg-Prosser was alerted to this deadly question on Monday night during a conversation with Piers Morgan, the editor of the Mirror. Mandelson's own aide concluded then that his master could not survive. 'Peter's finished,' Wegg-Prosser told one of Blair's aides. 'It's the size of it,' was Blair's private verdict to aides and officials about why the loan was so devastating. For the price of Mandelson's house in an elite enclave of west London could be bought a street of homes in his constituency of Hartlepool.</p> <p>Blair's initial prognosis that Mandelson was not to be saved was hardening by Tuesday morning into a certainty that he had to be severed. Alastair Campbell, thinking the media would never let go until Mandelson resigned, and Anji Hunter, protective of Blair's reputation, were both urging the Prime Minister to dispatch the Trade and Industry Secretary. Blair turned to another confidant for advice. He rang Philip Gould, who was spending Christmas in Jamaica. As warm as the weather was in the Caribbean, Blair's chilly fury transmitted itself down the line. 'Why aren't you here when I need you?' Blair snapped. Gould, while registering Blair's shock and anger, attempted to offer pleas in mitigation. After everything Mandelson had done to create New Labour, should he have his five-month career in the Cabinet terminated? 'You should hold on to Peter. You shouldn't give in to our enemies,' Gould argued. 'If you let Peter go, you'll be weakened.' Blair perceived that, but he saw himself and the Government being more damaged by letting Mandelson hang on. In response to Gould's entreaties to save Mandelson, Blair was stony: 'Look. Read the papers, Philip. Think again.' The phone went down.</p> <p>Blair had retired to Chequers when, at 10 on the night of Tuesday 22 December, he talked again to the man whose skills once so mesmerised him. Blair was not good at breaking bad news. He particularly did not relish telling a friend as old and as close as Mandelson that he wanted him gone. He allowed the other man to lead the conversation, asking for his own assessment. Mandelson still believed himself to be the victim of a 'stitch-up' by the Brownites. The press were 'completely hysterical' and 'out of control'. He had made a mistake, he was prepared to admit that now. Yet he clung to the belief that he could and must remain in the Cabinet.</p> <p>Mandelson did float the idea that he might have to resign. By describing this as 'very painful', he evidently hoped that Blair would respond by dismissing the idea. The words that would have been music for him were the Prime Minister saying that he wasn't going to sacrifice him under pressure from the media, and that the No 10 propaganda organ would be pumped to save him. How Blair replied was therefore a crushing disappointment. He told Mandelson that they should 'sleep on it'. Such an expert reader of the codes of political conversation grasped what Blair was semaphoring. The Prime Minister and those advising him wanted to see the following morning's newspapers before they made a final decision.</p> <p>The press was savage, though not unanimously so. The Guardian, the paper that broke the story, pronounced him guilty of 'more vanity than venality' and judged that resignation would be a sentence out of proportion to the crime. The Sun, which Mandelson once so assiduously courted, had gone down on him. The tabloid shrieked: 'So How The Hell Can Mandy Stay?' There were ironies to be savoured. Among the people whom Mandelson had cultivated was Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of the man who owned the Sun.</p> <p>Even now, a large percentage of Mandelson believed he could yet save his place in the Cabinet. At seven on Wednesday morning he phoned Wegg-Prosser to tell him to organise a 'fight-back' meeting at the DTI with Campbell, his deputy, Lance Price, and Jonathan Powell. Mandelson also talked twice to Gordon Brown. It is an example of the weird convolutions of their relationship that Mandelson turned to the man whom he suspected to have played a large role in precipitating the most traumatic moment of his career. In their first conversation, Brown expressed the view that he should apologise but not resign. Guilt may have been speaking. Mandelson would later come to the conclusion that, while Brown intended to damage, the Chancellor did not expect to destroy him. Anxiety was also informing Brown's reaction. He had reason to fear that, if Mandelson went, all the heat would concentrate on whether he and his coterie had connived to demolish a fellow Minister to the detriment of the Government. An exiled Mandelson would thirst for revenge. When he spoke to Brown for a second time that morning, the Chancellor sombrely rated Mandelson's survival prospects to be much more occluded. By now, Brown had spoken to Blair and discovered how conclusively determined the Prime Minister was to sack Mandelson.</p> <p>The fight-back meeting never happened. At shortly after 10am, Campbell and the others from No 10 arrived in Mandelson's ministerial suite in the DTI tower with its panoramic view of Westminster Abbey. Almost immediately, Campbell ordered everyone else out of the room and into the next door Private Office so that Mandelson could be put through to Blair.</p> <p>Blair was now explicit. The longer Mandelson tried to cling on, the more Mandelson and the Government would be damaged. Mandelson repeatedly asked Blair if that was really his opinion, in an effort to seek out a chink of weakness. That was his view, Blair flatly confirmed, offering the consolation that the quicker he left the Cabinet, the better chance there would be of a reasonably rapid return. By the end of the conversation, tears were trickling down Mandelson's sepulchral white cheeks. A dark-eyed Campbell, himself blubbing, gave Mandelson a hug.</p> <p>Recovering from this lachrymose moment with professional speed, Campbell then wrote a resignation letter for Mandelson and a reply for Blair. Campbell took his compositions to Wegg-Prosser to type up. The wretched Mandelson signed Campbell's draft virtually unaltered, though he first faxed it over to Gordon Brown for him to see. He wanted the Chancellor to taste some of the grief that had been inflicted on him. Blair faxed back Campbell's draft of the Prime Minister's reply with some added personal touches.</p> <p>The Chancellor spread the word among his entourage that their enemy had fallen. Ed Balls and his wife, Yvette Cooper, were on the road, driving to spend Christmas with parents. At precisely the moment that Gordon Brown rang his mobile, Ed and Yvette realised they had forgotten the turkey they were providing for the family Christmas. 'He's gone,' announced Brown. 'We've got to turn back,' Balls said to his wife. 'No, you don't understand. There's no turning back,' said Brown. 'He's resigning at 11 o'clock.' </p> <p>The announcement actually came slightly later, just before the lunchtime news bulletins. Soon after, Robinson was gone as well. Mandelson's resignation missive began: 'I can scarcely believe I am writing this letter...', which was scarcely surprising to those who knew that it had been composed by Alastair Campbell.</p> <p>The swiftness of his departure, and the manner in which it had been dressed up in the resignation letter ghosted by Campbell, succeeded in creating the impression that he had honourably withdrawn to spare the Government prolonged torture at the hands of its opponents. Denis MacShane, the Labour MP for Rotherham, voiced a widely believed platitude: 'Nothing became Peter's holding of high office as the manner of his leaving.' The notion that this was a graceful, selfless sacrifice was deceptive. Peter Mandelson did not fall on his sword. Tony Blair gently, firmly, ruthlessly and necessarily thrust Mandelson on to the blade.</p> <p>Blair's fury was accompanied by a sense of loss. He saw the gaping tear left in the Cabinet. Mandelson had been a Blairite before Blair. He was one of the few who could be called believers in New Labour from more than convenience or sycophancy. There was also the worry for Blair of what a wretchedly depressed Mandelson might do.</p> <p>At around noon on the day of the resignation, the Prime Minister asked Mandelson to Chequers, a characteristically kindly, but also calculating, gesture. It is a sign of the froideur between them that Cherie initiated the call. 'You will always be part of the family,' she told Mandelson. Only when his wife had broken the ice did Blair himself come on the line to say: 'We want you to be with us.' Mandelson and his partner, Reinaldo Avila Da Silva, joined the Blairs' family supper and spent the night. Mandelson was now contrite. 'I know I've done a terrible thing,' he confessed to Blair. 'I've hurt you and I've hurt the Government.' Blair had written out some advice about how to work his passage back: sell the house, get around the constituencies, be a team player. 'For God's sake,' he said to Mandelson. 'Make some friends in the Labour Party.'</p> <p>An ocean of bad blood had been spilt. To the poisonous feud between Brown and Mandelson, and the destabilising rivalry of Blair and Brown, there had now been added a twist to the relationship between Blair and Mandelson. Blair could never again invest quite the same level of trust in Mandelson's judgment.</p> <p> \u00a9 2000 Andrew Rawnsley. </p> <p>Extracted from Servants of the People by Andrew Rawnsley, to be published by Hamish Hamilton on 25 September at \u00a317.99.</p> <p>To order this book for \u00a314.99 plus 99p p&amp;p, call Observer Culture Shop on 0800 3168 171</p>"
