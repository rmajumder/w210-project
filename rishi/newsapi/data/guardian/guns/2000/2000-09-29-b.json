  "<p>Manchester United have provided the evidence this week that the bigger you are the harder you fall. The question is how quickly they can scramble to their feet, dust themselves down and resume business as normal. </p> <p>Whichever way you look at it, it has been one of those weeks for England's biggest club, when every silver lining has come with an attached cloud. </p> <p>First there was the loss of a 3-1 lead against Chelsea at Old Trafford. Another three goals were then shipped against PSV Eindhoven. And then burning cheeks all round as the club's first-ever director of communications, Alison Ryan,was sacked in disgrace only 13 days after being appointed. </p> <p>The United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said: \"She went through a series of interviews and Martin Edwards and myself both met her to see how we would get on with her. I didn't know anything about her background except that she was a lawyer. That's the only light I can shed on it.\" </p> <p>In all the excitement, the \u00a3300m kit sponsorship agreement with Nike has been all but forgotten. Life is anything but dull at Old Trafford. </p> <p>The fun could continue tomorrow at Highbury. \"Our away games at Arsenal are always so intense,\" Ferguson said yesterday. \"The games at Old Trafford are never any problem but Highbury is a tight ground. There always seems to be some kind of confrontation.\" </p> <p>Ferguson believes the match \"will need a top referee to handle it\", so the United manager should be pleased the job has gone to Graham Barber. </p> <p>\"Arsenal have been our main challengers in recent years and nothing has changed this season,\" said Ferguson. \"People thought there would be five teams involved but Chelsea and Leeds are in the bottom half of the league. That leaves Arsenal and Liverpool and you have to look at Arsenal as the more dangerous.\"</p>",
  "<p>The decision to launch David Seaman's autobiography with a book signing in Harrods could be interpreted as a sign, to those who believe he is past his sell-by date, that he is still high-quality goods. </p> <p>Of course, others might see it as yet another indication of his pretentiousness since he married his second wife Debbie, now also his agent and who, he admits in his book, has completely transformed his lifestyle. Thus the once quiet lad from Rotherham agreed to sell their nuptials to a celebrity magazine and now rubs his mighty shoulders with those of luvvies and celebrity hangers-on at film premieres, even hinting at following Vinnie Jones into the acting business. </p> <p>Seaman, however, would defy his critics to produce one smoking gun, let alone a couple of smoking barrels, as evidence to back their claims that he should be replaced as England goalkeeper. He says: \"The whole England team got a lot of stick before, during and after Euro 2000 and much of it was directed at me, which wasn't nice. But you just have to get on with it and play your game. The alternative is to go round whacking reporters. I never felt my position was under pressure with England or Arsenal. If the criticism had come from Kevin Keegan or Ars\u00e8ne Wenger I would have been worried, but it was just opinions from outsiders.\" </p> <p>He is so sure of his position at Arsenal that he felt confident enough to confide that the players refer to Wenger as Inspector Clouseau because of his clumsy manner. And, unlike Tony Blair, Seaman is not about to announce that he is listening to his critics, since he does not believe his form has merited the vitriol. </p> <p>Reliving the best and worst of his career for his autobiography has helped him develop a philosophical approach to the vagaries of his position, in which the highs can disappear into outer space and the lows leave one depressed enough to seek a spell in the Priory. </p> <p>He says: \"You can make loads of great saves in a game and then drop a clanger which makes you the biggest villain in the world. If ever there was a game that highlighted that, it was Arsenal's European Cup Winners' Cup final against Real Zaragoza in 1995. I had a great game in the semi-final and was playing well in the final until that 40-yard winner from Nayim in the dying seconds. That's the life of the goalie and always will be.\" </p> <p>Right now, it seems like the life of Riley for Arsenal fans after the brilliant win over the Italian champions Lazio on Wednesday which has taken them not so much on to the threshold of Champions League qualification as halfway down the hall. Tomorrow, Arsenal hope to put a first domestic dent in Manchester United's season, before Seaman returns to the England side against Germany in the World Cup qualifier at Wembley next weekend, the final game under the twin towers. </p> <p>Wembley may hold many special memories for him. But he and his Arsenal team-mates might have offered to demolish the place early if they had once again been forced to play Champions League matches there. </p> <p>Seaman, 37, says: \"The trouble with Wembley is that every player likes playing there, whether you are the home side or the opposition. And the crowd are 30 to 40 yards from the pitch whereas at Highbury they are breathing down your neck, which has made for a great atmosphere in both our European games this season. It has proved that is the place for us to play.\" </p> <p>And how Arsenal played against Lazio, defying those who believed that the departure of Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit to Barcelona had stripped them of the quality to challenge United for the Premiership, let alone to sustain a European campaign. </p> <p>Defeat at Sunderland on the opening day seemed to confirm the impression that the old Arsenal machine was growing rusty and in need of a new engine driver. They have struggled, too, in all their other away games, squeezing draws at Chelsea, Bradford and Ipswich. </p> <p>Crucially, though, they have remained unbeaten since the Sunderland game. As Seaman points out, some of the players released into the limelight from understudy roles to Petit and Overmars have also proved more than worthy of centre stage. None more so than Gilles Grimandi, who has played at right-back, centre-half and central midfield. </p> <p>It says much for the threat posed by Arsenal that Manchester United's manager Sir Alex Ferguson made his disastrous decision to send out a weakened team at PSV Eindhoven in midweek so that his best players would be fresh for Highbury. </p> <p>Seaman says: \"It's a massive game for us. Manchester United are three points ahead of us and they won by such a big margin last season that we have to keep as close as possible early in the season. We're confident of getting it right. I know Michael Owen has said United are by far the best team in the country but you'd never hear an Arsenal player saying that.\" </p> <p>With Patrick Vieira serving the last game of his suspension tomorrow and Sylvain Wiltord moving towards full fitness, Seaman feels Arsenal can prove they are a stronger team than last season. And should Barcelona fail to qualify for the Champions League's second stage, there might be two old boys casting wistful backward glances at Highbury.</p>",
  "<p>The continuing saga of glasnost at Old Trafford took an entertaining new twist this week when Manchester United's freshly recruited director of communications was relieved of her post only 13 days after she was appointed. </p> <p>Alison Ryan - fresh from a stint with the cable firm NTL - turned out to be a follower of the approach to the truth favoured by Alan Clark (the randy diarist and politician, not the former Leeds forward otherwise known as Sniffer). </p> <p>A little lax with the old actualit\u00e9, Ms Ryan had been disbarred by the Law Society on nine counts of professional misconduct. </p> <p>She had, it is said, lied on her CV. </p> <p>Yet with a history like that, she managed to satisfy a head-hunting agency, beat off the challenge of other candidates alleged to include the BBC sports correspondent Rob Bonnett and even charmed Sir Alex Ferguson, before only being undone when former colleagues noticed her sudden elevation. </p> <p>Her success in managing to skate round the truth for so long, leads to an interesting question: since when has a loose relationship with the facts ever been reckoned an obstacle to being a spin doctor?</p>",
  "<p>I've just watched a movie that you'll never have heard of. More than two million people have viewed it since it opened, despite the fact that it's never seen the inside of a cinema or TV screen. 405 (<a href=\"http://www.IFilm.com\" target=\"_new\">IFilm.com</a>) is a tense, special-effects-packed action spectacular. Which is admirable, considering it's all of two minutes and 58 seconds long. And you can only see it on the internet.</p> <p>Welcome to the world of webfilm. With 13 million UK internet users, part of an estimated 300 million users worldwide, the net has rapidly grown beyond its initial provision of information, communication and consumer services. Over 70% of domestic users now claim their online priority is entertainment. And increasingly they're finding it where their great-grandparents did, in short films and saucy animations. The penny arcade and the Kinetoscope have been reincarnated for an internet audience in short-film sites and the webfilm. </p> <p>By webfilm we mean the broad and varied swathe of moving-image entertainment which is viewable on the internet either via streamed video or downloadable files (see <a href=\"#learn\">'Learn what works'</a>). In addition to innumerable independent films, you can find popular animated and live-action film series such as Lil' Pimp (<a href=\"http://www.mediatrip.com/home/index_pimp.html\" target=\"_new\"> mediatrip.com</a>) or Bikini Bandits (<a href=\"http://www.AtomFilms.com\" target=\"_new\">AtomFilms</a>), episodic movies like Running Time (<a href=\"http://www.itsyourmovie.com\" target=\"_new\">itsyourmovie.com</a>), linear or interactive cartoons at <a href=\"http://www.Shockwave.com\" target=\"_new\">Shockwave</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Icebox.com\" target=\"new\">Icebox.com</a>, and even web-specific film works at <a href=\"http://www.TheBitScreen.com\" target=\"_new\">TheBitScreen.com</a>. </p> <p>What they all have in common is that they're short. They suit our impatient lifestyle, and fit our MTV-honed attention spans. Webfilms have become the espresso of the entertainment world, providing office workers with a fun 'hit' during a busy day. Most of all however, we love shorts because they suit the limited bandwidth available to most domestic internet surfers, who are dependent on 28.8k or 56k dial-up modems.</p> <p>Barely two years old as a concept, webfilm is only just past its goldrush period, so sites and film content are comparatively diverse compared with traditional media outlets. Though the majority of viewer traffic is inevitably towards American titles on mainstream sites, you'll find that international offerings, films made by artists often for gallery exhibition, and experimental interactive work are also uniquely accessible on the web. To gauge the full range of what's on offer, dip into our reviews of 40-odd handpicked sites, where you can mind the quality and feel the bandwidth. </p> <p>But most importantly, get out there now and start viewing. Pleasingly diverse content on short film sites will only last as long as the venture capital funding that is currently sustaining all but the most successful of them. Watching shorts is a painless, often surprisingly pleasurable way to expand your film horizons. If you swear blind you don't enjoy foreign, 'extreme', guerrilla, spoof, experimental, or interactive media, make your motto 'suck it and see'. Right now, if you have a net connection you have (virtually) free access to thousands of webfilms, on hundreds of sites, in dozens of genres.</p> <p><strong>What's out there?</strong> </p> <p>Everything. Literally. To attract and retain viewers, that first rush of film school graduation movies is giving way to web-specific films, episodic live-action and animated series, s/exploitation fare, and 'extreme' cartoons. Traditional Hollywood hierarchies don't yet apply on the web. Even though webfilm is becoming slicker and more mainstream, you can still find industry professionals' early efforts rubbing shoulders with the best work by student directors, animators and festival award-winners. British first-time film-makers can give their previously unseen shorts an airing at BT's <a href=\"http://www.getoutthere.com\" target=\"_new\">Getoutthere</a>, there's even a place for high-quality amateur video, in <a href=\"http://www.cameraplanet.com/cp5/home2.php\" target=\"_new\">Camera Planet</a>'s video stories, and on <a href=\"http://www.eveo.com/\" target=\"_new\">Eveo</a>'s successful user-contributed content site. </p> <p>Star names hooked up with entertainment websites during 2000, starting with animation giants like James L. Brooks (The Simpsons), Spumco (Ren &amp; Stimpy), Trey Parker and Matt Stone (South Park), and director Tim Burton, all of whom signed up to create new series for entertainment sites Shockwave or Icebox. But Hollywood names won't arrive in force until the online business can prove that its stability and cash prospects are blue-chip rather than blue-sky.</p> <p><strong>Get set up</strong> </p> <p>In order to watch film on the web, you will need to install player software, known as 'plug-ins' which allows you to stream or download video to your computer. The most widely used are RealPlayer, Microsoft's Window's Media Player, Apple's QuickTime, and Macromedia's Shockwave Flash for animations. Plug-in software is free, and short-film sites invariably provide links to step-by-step sites where you can download and install the relevant player. If you're using Netscape, check your existing plug-ins by clicking on the 'Help' button on your browser bar, and then on 'About Plugins'. Don't cram your hard-drive with duplicates, and remember to delete outdated versions when you upgrade your various media players, to avoid confusing your browser. </p> <p>For those of you seeking a film hit during working hours, you may find that the speedy office internet connection has a firewall that doesn't allow you to download plug-ins, in which case you'll have to settle for animation-only viewing on company time (most office firewalls allow Flash access). But there's plenty to keep you occupied here: some of the best and most innovative sites out there are flash-based animations ones - see our site reviews.</p> <p><strong>Learn what works</strong></p> <p>Most short-film and entertainment sites use 'streaming media', which allows you watch film or video without downloading it. If you have a 56k or slower modem connection you may well be better off downloading films to play back later. Unless you're lucky enough to have a fast and powerful net connection, watching films via streamed media can be a very frustrating experience - you're likely to get blurry images, slow frame rates, and underwater sound quality. Animation, or short, clear genre pieces like comedies and thrillers survive modem speed limitations best. You'll learn to avoid films (however short) whose plots turn on the emotions flickering across the hero's face, his one-word answer, or a tell-tale close-up, unless you have broadband access (see <a href=\"#broadband\">'The broadband era dawns'</a>, or are happily resigned to never knowing the outcome.</p> <p><strong>Get your eye in</strong></p> <p>Critical consumption is as key to enjoying webfilm as it is to traditional media. Five minutes loading a duff movie is five wasted minutes, whatever the medium. Use the 'Highest Rated', 'Most Popular' and 'Editor's Picks' charts that most sites include to help you navigate through the ocean swell of shorts. You'll also learn the particular strengths of a site, and the tastes of its regular audience. Featured festival award-winners and curated film programmes (like those at <a href=\"http://www.ShortFest.com\" target=\"_new\"> ShortFest</a>) often prove the best shortcuts to high-quality work. Registering for emailed newsletters or free 'member' status at favourite sites feels geeky, but can provide useful tip-offs and privileged access to hot new titles.</p> <p>Even if you eschew the short-film rating and viewer review options as the haunts of anoraks and shameless show-offs, you might have noticed that part of the joy of the web is adding and taking away things. Failure to rate and review any little gem you stumble on dooms it to live uncharted and unseen by a wider public. If you like something, pat it on the back. For once, if you want to talk back to the director, you can be sure that he or she will take notice (all short film directors lurk around their web work, neurotically checking their feedback).</p> <p><strong>The broadband era</strong> </p> <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged in European web circles that the off-peak phone charge hours (when most of us are free to surf these sites), are those when a) all of America is online b) the net is at its most congested, and c) servers tend to be at their most overloaded. For viewing longer work (say, 8 minutes plus) your best bet is to try before midday, at dead of night, or to give up and put your name down for a high-speed broadband internet connection using an ADSL phoneline. </p> <p>Mass-market broadband internet access is just becoming available in the UK. Using ADSL phone lines or cable modems, consumers can access the net at 500kbps - 10 times faster than standard dial-up modems. BT Openworld, Freeserve Plus and Chello are some of the first to offer a broadband connection with permanent connectivity, unmetered access, faster downloads, and exclusive content that shows off vastly upgraded media access.</p> <p>The downside is that all of these come in at a steep monthly cost (around \u00a340), plus a one-off connection fee. Keep an eye on your local cable company's offers, being mindful that all broadband services offered in the UK to date have been oversubscribed, and early-adopting broadband customers have complained of net congestion and access difficulties resulting from overloaded ISP servers. Also worth noting is that fast broadband access is only part of the story - net users are still hamstrung by the speed of any single site's server. It's no use being able to receive a flood of data, if the site is only sending it out in a trickle.</p>",

  "Who won the last election for Labour? Women who swung to Labour for the first time. But it was shallow and conditional support. Now it is ebbing away, with 5% more women than men turning against Labour. Women caused all the last Conservative governments: Tony Blair won't get his progressive century unless he recaptures their vote. The perfunctory low-profile women's debate yesterday shows Labour doesn't get it - yet. It all happened instead at the women's fringe meeting. <p>As the election nears, Labour's back-room suits with the psephological calculators are showing an unaccustomed flicker of interest in the potential of women ministers and MPs. Come elections, women are an asset not an irrelevence. Voters prefer women politicians, who get consistently higher recognition and approval ratings even though they are in lesser jobs. Labour is going to need them, lots of them, up front everywhere, on the box and on the soap box pretending to be what they haven't been - key figures at the heart of government. </p> <p>Behind the scenes, women are flexing their muscles. Senior women ministers have written to Jack Straw demanding something be done to amend the law to allow quotas for women parliamentary candidates. Too late. In Labour-held seats, 27 men have been selected and only two women. More men called John have been selected than women. Buggins after buggins have slid snuggly into local seats, defeating far better women. Harriet Harman and Joan Ruddock saw this coming. Straight after the last election they warned Straw that no more women would be selected without positive action. Straw thought the new \"sea\" of women MPs quite enough and refused. Now many fear the byelections committee will fly in a host of last-minute candidates to replace elevated old has-beens: will they be favoured male apparatchiks or women and black candidates? </p> <p>How have the women fared in this first term? Not well. Talking to women ministers this week, most describe lives that sound almost unendurable. Determination, deep engagement with making their policies work plus ambition keeps them going, but some begin to wonder why. Start with the abuse. The political cadres immediately declared the Labour women mainly rubbish - Blair's babes, bleeper fodder, empty vessels. Swathes of male backbench dross went unremarked. Every prominent woman has been personally and poisonously attacked just for being a woman. Ghastly Nanny Tessa Jowell, frightful Toff Margaret Jay - women attract unique bile. </p> <p>Every woman I spoke to has been done over by the press - rooting in the undergrowth of their past, searching for hypocrisy or angry bygone lovers, ex-husbands, anyone with anything discrediting to tell, with children harried and parents harrassed. If it weren't too painful for them, I could draw up an astounding dossier on this sexist campaign of vilification against women politicians. Where were the male colleagues who should have been standing shoulder to shoulder to defend them? All too often chortling in the bar with the men writing this stuff, or, in Mo's case, conducting a supercilious and jealous \"she's not up to it\" campaign that drove her out. How many men command one iota of her public affection? </p> <p>Women ministers, spread painfully thin and lonely in their departmental silos, are still too few to form that critical mass that makes being female normal. Politics remains a male trade, reported on mainly by men: the testosterone rush in the fetid press centre at party conferences is a reminder. It is interesting how instinctively women politicians and women journalists tend to draw together, creating an alternative network - one step outside the briefing and counter-briefing viciousness. The culture changes at a glacial pace. </p> <p> If women whinge in public it looks like weakness. As ever, some of their tormentors are \"sisters\" of an older generation. The departure of Betty Boothroyd was greeted with joy by women MPs: the old Tiller girl, beloved by men, disliked women and gave no ground on any change. Gwyneth Dunwoody, the only female candidate for the Speaker's job, would be every bit as bad: women MPs just hope for a modernising man. Margaret Beckett as leader of the house heads the modernisation of the commons committee which has made scant change. Ann Taylor wields her chief whip with all the old mad relish, backed by the tough lads in her office up drinking late and laughing at MPs begging to be let go. Every woman minister (and men if they unbutton enough) has horror stories of unrelenting whips forcing late nights on already unbearable schedules. The sadism of absolute power corrupts absolutely in this whipping, bullying parody of public school. </p> <p>It's hardly surprising the intimidated new girls didn't make enough fuss. Now they must. No more traditional cross-party agreement with the Tory clubmen who block change - Labour must lay down the law on parliamentary reform. The Fawcett Society, backed by women MPs, is petitioning for a parliament with ordinary hours and terms that fit school holidays, instead of late nights and an absurdly long recess. </p> <p>The public may not care about the working conditions of their privileged rulers. But the dangerous disengagement with the political process starts here. Polls show people hate the look of West minster, the ranting, strutting and posturing. It will look even more male next time, even more rebarbative to women. The hell of women's working lives in parliament only reflects the low priority the government has given to work/life balance issues that wrench women's lives everywhere. (And men's too.) </p> <p>In the election no doubt women will be pushed up front. What happens afterwards? If Tony Blair understood how much humanising politics matters to democracy, he would replace his cabinet of unrecognisable bank managers with women in good, prominent jobs. This time put women inside every loop as the key politicial advisers and lobby fixers. </p> <p>Labour gets too little credit for the all it's done for women - minimum wage, part-time workers' rights and a great deal more. Good policies are no use if without great communicators to sell them. Old neo-endogenous growth Gordon or even \"y'know\" Blair on Richard and Judy's sofa don't reach women with that story. </p> <p>Men talking about childcare sound patronising. Women talk best to women - and often better to men too: advertisers know this. It takes Mo, Clare, Tessa, Patricia, Harriet, Estelle, Dawn, two Margarets and all the others to make women voters believe. They are less likely to spout statistics and more likely to admit childcare is still more promise than reality. The political arena of jousting boys on the make doesn't just leave women politicians out, it leaves women voters out too. Since it's older women who mostly vote Tory, while under-35 women mostly vote Labour, history is on the side of the progressive century. But only if Labour has a sex change. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>DRAWING BLANKS</strong></p> <p>It's the second most important trophy in Europe and it's of absolutely no concern to anybody down the Kings Road. It's Euro-vase, and the draw for the second round was made this morning. The Fiver sat through the whole shebang, bravely stomaching the sight of two wobbly Uefa executives gripping their velvet ball bags just for you. Don't say we never go out of our way to please.</p> <p>BBC1 light-entertainment troupe Liverpool were rewarded for their spectacular 0-0 victory over Rapid Bucharest with an easy-looking draw against Slovan Liberec. To be frank, we've never heard of this lot before - but we do know they're from the Czech Republic, so maybe Patrick Berger and Vladimir Anderton will be familiar with them. Perhaps. One thing is certain, though: Gerard Houllier will be standing around with a trademark totally bewildered look on his face as the first leg is played out at Anfield on October 26. </p> <p>At the same time, Martin O'Neill will be on the prowl in France, where his team The Celtic Loyals have to face Bordeaux. This is sadly a tough draw for the Celts - their last foray into Europe ended in humiliation at the hands of another French side, Lyon. But they do get to play the second leg at home. That's something at least. Well, isn't it?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.easyshop.co.uk/easyshop/fgf.asp?promo=SU1946LC\">Thinking about lingerie? \u00a310 voucher to use when you spend \u00a330 or more at Easyshop.

But that's exactly what they got. X-rays today confirmed that Roberto di Matteo has indeed broken his leg. Ow! And the most talented footballer in the world has given Dennis Wise a good verbal kicking. Oof! Ooyah! Oof!</p> <p>Last night, poor di Matteo suffered a double fracture of his left leg as his team-mates set about humiliating themselves. The Swiss-born Italian has already undergone an operation and is expected to stay in the country of his birth for a few days. \"Given what's happened he's as well as can be expected,\" said Gwyn Williams, the assistant manager of Chelsea, the continental club playing only in England.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as one midfielder lay stricken, another was being fondly remembered by Zinedine Zidane. \"It is difficult to play a good game when you get an elbow in the face,\" Zidane opined after being questioned about France's recent friendly with England. \"For me, it was very clear that I was the target,\" he continued, probably gesticulating wildly. \"He thumped me as if I was his worst enemy, it was unbelievable. What Wise did, it was worse than anything. He took me for nothing, for a crap.\" Much more of this sort of talk and Chelsea, the continental club playing only in England, will be in danger of becoming a laughing stock. What's that? Oh.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I've got a little book in which I've written down the names of those people who upset me the most. I don't want to name them because I want it to be a surprise when I get them back. I know I will get them some day\" - England vice-captain David Beckham displays his new-found maturity in the pages of OK! magazine.</p> <p><strong>JEFFREY ARCHER COULDN'T WRITE THIS</strong></p> <p>It's not often the Fiver feels sorry for Manchester United, and today is no different. Instead - and not for the first time - we feel like shaking the \"biggest\" football club in the world by it's oversized ego and telling it to pull its act together. Because only 13 days after the club announced that Alison Ryan would be their touchy-feely new director of communications, the club has sacked her from the \u00a3100,000 PR post after finding out that she told some gigantic porkies about her past.</p> <p>First, Ms Ryan claimed that she had a first-class degree from Cambridge when she had only attained a second. And if that wasn't bad enough (and it isn't) she also upgraded her law qualifications and invented a dodgy reference. Eventually, the law society caught up with her, but even then she failed to appear before their disciplinary committee, fleeing to Cuba where she claimed she was doing charity work. Thankfully, Castro soon sent her packing, and last year she was finally debarred by the Bar Council for a series of \"serious offences\".</p> <p>However, all this was news to Manchester United, because only two weeks ago chief executive Peter Kenyon described her as having \"an impressive track record\". And even the Imperial Lord Ferg was horribly duped, claiming: \"I am sure Alison will fit in well here\". So how could another tragic tale of misfortune befall the world's \"biggest\" club? Fingers are already pointing at the recruitment agency Howgate Sable, who were given the task of finding Ms Right (and instead found Ms Ryan). And who used to be a consultant for Howgate Sable? Why, none other than Sir Roland Smith, the chairman of United's plc board. That's very unfortunate - to say the least.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Most ridiculous rumour of the day #1: Manchester United will use their multi-million pound deal with Nike to make an audacious bid for Ronaldo, claims Italian newspaper Tuttosport. Ronaldo's press spokesman, Rodriguo Paiva, claims his charge \"wants to learn English\". That's the evidence.</p> <p>Most ridiculous rumour of the day #2: Shakhtar Donetsk manager Victor Prokopenko has told Planet Football he fails to understand why Arsenal have not made a formal bid for his goalkeeper Yuri Virt. \"Could it be that the price tag for Yuri's transfer is just too high for them?\" asks Prokopenko. \"Could it be because Virt can't catch a ball to save his life and makes Ian Walker look safe on crosses?\" asks the Fiver.</p> <p>Speaking of Ian Walker, the Spurs keeper has been linked with Celtic.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Leicester have decided not to lodge an official complaint over the behaviour of Red Star Belgrade supporters during last night's Euro-vase clash in Vienna. But City chairman John Elsom is optimistic that Uefa may decide to act on their own accord after they study the report of their own observer. Leicester fans were pelted with missiles before the game and then had flares fired at them in the stadium.

  "<p>The Financial Times is launching a tabloid supplement called Creative Business on October 10 as part of a raft of editorial changes. </p> <p>The weekly, 16-page supplement about the business side of the creative industries is to be edited by former FT deputy home news editor Andrew Davies, who will be responsible for six editorial staff.</p> <p>Philip Stephens, editor of the FT's UK and Ireland edition, said the development was part of a longer term strategy to make the paper more \"accessible\". The process began a year ago with a redesign and the launch of a supplement called the Business. </p> <p>Mr Stephens said that recent ABC figures showing a 6% year-on-year circulation increase suggested the first part of the strategy had been successful. \"We got just the right kind of reactions, which suggests people think the FT is now less daunting, more friendly and easier on the eye.\" </p> <p>He added that the FT was shifting its target readership to take account of the fact that business culture was now \"increasingly mainstream\".</p> <p>\"We have to write for a community that isn't a corporate community any more. Fewer of our readers are big company executives, and there are far more potential readers in small and medium-sized businesses.\"</p> <p>Creative Business is being launched to fill what Mr Stephens described as a gap in the market for a publication \"to help translate creative ideas into business\". The section will focus on a broad remit of industries, from television and architecture to film and software design.</p> <p>From October 9, the FT will incorporate law and business into Inside Track, launch two columns dealing with technology and management, and a new Monday sports section.</p>",
  "Pierre Trudeau, the flamboyant politician who led Canada for more than 15 years in which he shocked, thrilled and inspired his nation, died yesterday, aged 80, from Parkinson's disease and prostate cancer. <p>Canada was yesterday preparing for a state funeral and a lengthy period of mourning for Trudeau, who was recently voted the most important Canadian of the 20th century. </p> <p>Trudeau was the country's prime minister from 1968 to 1979 and, after a nine-month interlude, from 1980 to 1984. His relaxed style, his habit of speaking his mind and his marriage to a woman 29 years his junior all contributed to \"Trudeaumania\" at home, and global celebrity. </p> <p>His death was announced by Roy Heenan, a partner in his Montreal law firm. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation interrupted regular viewing to broadcast a special programme about Trudeau's life.</p> <p>Trudeau was a French Canadian who changed his country from a monocultural English-dominated state to a bilingual and more tolerant place. In so doing, he defused a growing Quebec separatist movement.</p> <p>He became unpopular in western Canada for his insistence on holding down prices that the region could charge the rest of the country for oil and national gas. At one point, when confronted by a crowd of hecklers who barracked him on the subject, he famously raised his middle finger at them in an insouciant salute.</p> <p>Outside Canada he will probably be best remembered for his easy going celebrity, his acerbic sense of humour and his wedding at 51 to the 22-year-old Margaret Sinclair. The marriage soon turned sour, as she cuckolded Trudeau, once disappearing after a Rolling Stones concert to become a temporary groupie. </p> <p>Even in his twilight years, he was irrepressible. At 71 he was named on a birth certificate as father of a girl born to Deborah Coyne, 36, a Liberal party constitutional expert.</p> <p>Trudeau's friends said he never fully recovered from the death of his third son, Michel, who was swept into a lake by an avalanche in 1998 while on a ski trip in British Columbia. Trudeau brought instant sex appeal to a staid political culture, driving around Ottawa in a convertible car, and dating a string of beautiful women. </p> <p>He also led the drive to distance Canada from British apron strings, enshrining a Charter of Rights in a new constitution in 1982. In a supreme act of irreverence, he once turned a balletic pirouette behind the Queen's back.</p>",
  "Saudi Arabia celebrated its National Day last week. In London, the country's embassy marked the occasion with a party in a huge marquee, which vaguely resembled a bedouin's tent. <p>Inside was the ultimate in Arab hospitality: whole roast lambs, non-alcoholic drinks of every imaginable colour and more varieties of dates than I ever knew existed. In the centre, an all-male troupe of entertainers sang, danced, beat their drums and brandished long, decorative swords. Several of the more distinguished guests joined in.</p> <p>Returning to the Guardian office, I checked the news wires and was reminded that swords are not just for dancing with. In Saudi Arabia, another person had been beheaded, bringing the total for this year to just over 100.</p> <p>Amnesty International has already published several damning reports on human rights in Saudi Arabia, and last Wednesday it issued another, dealing with the rights of women. The picture, not surprisingly, was one of systematic discrimination against women in many fields of activity, supplemented by arbitrary detentions, floggings and executions.</p> <p>In non-democratic countries, we tend to blame the rulers for human rights abuses, imagining that they merely have to say \"aye\" or \"nay\" and whatever they want will be done. This is rarely the whole story: there are usually powerful interest groups to be considered - and in the case of Saudi Arabia it is the religious authorities, the ulama.</p> <p>Attitudes of society also play a large part. Leaders can set an example, but they always argue that moving too fast will alienate the public. A gradual approach merits some sympathy, but is of little comfort to those whose heads or hands have been chopped off in the meantime, and it can easily turn into an excuse for doing nothing.</p> <p>The Amnesty report documented some appalling cases of domestic violence against wives and rape of household servants in Saudi Arabia. No sensible person would attempt to justify these, either in terms of Islam or acceptable social practice. But because of other traditions, the Saudi system does little to discourage or prevent them.</p> <p>For example, a woman who cries rape risks getting into trouble with the law. If she goes to the police station she may be arrested along the way for walking unaccompanied in the street. If she gets as far as the police station she risks being charged with the crime of qadhf - making slanderous accusations - which is punishable by lashes.</p> <p>Measures proposed by Amnesty include the setting up of refuges where women can be protected from their abusers (often male members of their own family), and the recruitment of female police officers to assist in all cases involving women. Even such modest changes may be too much for the traditionalists to stomach because they would interfere with some long-established prerogatives of men.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are some encouraging signs. Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, who is in charge of the day-to-day running of the kingdom, spoke on television about the need to include women in the country's development. And the popular Saudi magazine, al-Majalla, recently published a ten-page feature on domestic violence - something that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.</p> <p>Amnesty believes the Saudis are on the verge of a constructive dialogue on human rights that may, eventually, bring changes. Despite several requests, the organisation has still not been allowed to make an official visit to the kingdom but it did get an invitation to last week's party and was pleased to accept.</p>",
  "<p>Balanced precariously on railings overlooking the crush of white boiler suited Italian Ya Basta demonstrators and Czech riot police, the man from the Wall Street Journal pulled his cellphone from his ear. \"I'm heading back to the press centre,\" he told us. \"My colleagues are watching it all on television - I'll get a better view.\"</p> <p>Not everyone would agree with that. But it's certainly true that more than a hundred and fifty TV cameras and stills photographers were jostling for the best view of the \"action\" on the Nuselsky Bridge, nevermind the rest of the city. For a time the men and women in the red \"PRESS\" bibs outnumbered the protestors - their lenses following every swelling of bodies, tyres and balloons, every casual swing of a police baton, every surge in volume of the cries of \"democracy, democracy\". </p> <p>Across the ravine inside the Conference Centre the Managing Director of the IMF, Horst K\u00f6hler, was thanking the citizens of \"the beautiful and historic city of Prague, for their warm hospitality\". Across the city those very same citizens were being treated to a spectacle of peaceful banner waving, colourful dancing - and nonchalant violence. </p> <p>The hot afternoon settled down into a steady standoff on the bridge. The prominent Ya Basta demonstrator Frederico Mariani appeared to win a face to face argument with protestors garbed in red hoods emblazoned with hammers and sickles. The word went round: the neo Communists had wanted to fight the cops - the Italians had insisted on non violent confrontation. The result?</p> <p>The Reds faded away. A couple of hours later across to the west the city was shrouded in grey smoke: a blend of protestors' fire crackers and police tear gas. </p> <p>Later, over at the Corinthia Towers Hotel - almost half owned by Libyans and so off limits to Americans - the strengths and flaws of the Czech policing operation were exposed. Within a hundred metres of the IMF Conference Centre - and spitting distance of delegates out on the hotel balcony, glued to the scene - Czech police were humiliated by demonstrators dolled up in pink, dancing to samba sounds. </p> <p>A set of railings meant to keep the protestors at bay tumbled to the ground, demonstrators taunted a small group of very nervous looking police officers - who were outnumbered and lacked protective gear. A woman wrapped in a fuschia boa led a group of several hundred protestors up a grassy hillside towards the delegates' hotel - with batons drawn the police backed off, conceding their ground and losing control of the situation. </p> <p>At the back of the pack some demonstrators began throwing stones at the police - and at the delegates crowding the balconies. A window was smashed. After desperately flailing around the police came together on the high ground and for a moment all was uneasy calm. Finally large numbers of heavily armoured riot police appeared, some with dogs. </p> <p>As the protestors continued chanting and some continued chucking stones, the robocop like police formed into two lines and charged down the hill towards them. Firecrackers - laid by the protestors - went off all around the riot police as they chased the pink samba lovers away and regained control of the area. I saw the odd officer striking demonstrators with their batons. But in the episode at the Corinithia Towers if the police can be accused of anything it is inadequate preparation - a lack of fully trained, fully geared up officers - and a failure of nerve. </p> <p>Protestor media is now reporting unconfirmed stories of police brutality against demonstrators arrested in the days after S26. Allegations centred on off camera activities are hard to verify and have so far failed to capture the mainstream media's attention. Why? Perhaps the American delegate who watched the demonstrators trying to break into the hotel and told us \"It was great\", offers some insight. S26 was a spectacle, and spectacle makes great television. The real thing can't compete - just ask the man from the Wall Street Journal. </p> <p><strong>Tristan Quinn</strong> was in Prague for BBC Newsnight</p>",
  "<p><strong>starling5</strong> <br> Are you prepared to accept an ethical dimension to your Gaia theory whereby all lives have equal value? Or are we, as humans, entitled to favour ourselves as we must in everyday life?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> So far as Gaia is concerned, humans are not special. We're just another species. There is a strong ethic attached to Gaia, and that is that the species that lives well with its environment favours it for its progeny and the species that fouls the environment spoils it for its progeny and goes extinct.</p> <p><strong>nsalt </strong><br> Your thoughts on nuclear power are refreshing. For so long it has been singled out as the evil amongst energy sources while conventional power stations the world over continue to belch their polluting gases. But there is a risk factor with nuclear power even if it's smaller than that of coal etc. Renewable fuels, particularly biomass, used locally on a small scale seem better still. Should we be putting more effort into this research?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> Large-scale nuclear power is the only practical way that we have to solve the greenhouse gas problem. Of course we should do everything else as well including renewable fuels, windmills, but we should recognise that these are no substitute.</p> <p><strong>greenday234</strong><br> You probably get asked this a lot, but how did you come to know William Golding, who gave Gaia her/its name? What was he like and what did he think of the theory?</p> <p> <strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> I knew Bill Golding as a neighbour when I lived in Wiltshire. He was a good friend and we would often talk as we walked to the village post office about half a mile away. When it was something exciting, like Gaia, we would walk well beyond the post office. He liked the theory, perhaps because he had been trained in physics as a student as well as in the arts. He said that if you would put forward a big theory about the earth, you'd better give it a good name and he would call it Gaia. We walked on for 20 minutes talking at cross-purposes because I thought he meant 'gyre' (I have no classics). Then Bill said no, I meant Gaia - the Greek goddess.</p> <p><strong> jjjeremy</strong><br> You say that nuclear power plants may be useful in supply electricity without worsening global warming. But doesn't it take generating extra greenhouse gases to be able to build and then dispose of one nuclear power plant. A nuclear power station also has to be very big to work with a centralised power grid and we would need to build a lot of them across Europe. Wouldn't we just end up with big, inefficient plants and lots more greenhouse gases? <br> Wouldn't it be better to decentralise the grid, build efficiency into useage and the grid, use renewables and take away the subsidies from nuclear power generation and give this to alternatives?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> It's true that building a nuclear power plant will require a lot of concrete and release a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. However, a plant runs for 50 years or more, and in that time release vastly less greenhouse gas than fossil fuel-burning power stations. <br> I believe that in Sweden small-scale nuclear power stations have now been designed for public use.</p> <p><strong>kudra</strong> <br> What are your thoughts on the recent fuel 'crisis' and the way that it was/is being handled?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> The public response to the recent fuel crisis appalled me. They seemed to have no idea whatsoever of the dangers that lie ahead and thought only of their immediate personal needs. I should not have been surprised because in China, with its truly powerful government, they have admitted that they cannot hold back the personal aspirations of the people where burning fossil fuels is concerned. <br> In a survey during the Suez fuel crisis, people interviewed claimed to be prepared to pay so much for fuel that their families would be in danger of privation. They valued personal mobility above all else. This is a human characteristic. <br> I think the Chancellor is right - you've got to be tough on this one.</p> <p><strong> nisaac </strong><br> I think that Gaia is a great metaphor for processes in the biosphere. However, I've been disappointed to find that other ecologists instinctively recoil at the idea of the Planet Personified. Whilst they are right to argue in favour of rigorous hypothesis testing, we all need some kind of bigger picture. What do you make of this? Where is the halfway house?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> I think the biologists fight dirty. You have to use metaphor to explain science to people. The biologists have the wonderful metaphor of the selfish gene. No one challenges them, saying 'how absurd - how could a gene take thought and be selfish?' <br> So why do they dislike my metaphor of a living earth? <br> It's very expensive to experiment with the earth - as we shall soon find out, for that's exactly what we've been doing with C02s.</p> <p><strong>rgsharp</strong><br> How would you sum up the concept of 'Gaia'?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> Gaia is a theory about the earth. It sees it as a self-regulating system. It keeps its climate and its chemistry always comfortable for whatever is the contemporary biosphere. Its major difference from older evolutionary theories such as Darwinism is that it sees organisms not just adapting to the environment, but changing it as well.</p> <p><strong> rabbit21 </strong><br> How far do you consider the name 'Gaia' to be responsible for the popular attraction to your theory? Equally, how far do you consider the name to be responsible for popular misunderstanding of the theory?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> Folk need a good metaphor and 'Gaia' has helped establish herself by her nice short name. <br> Naturally, many academic scientists do not like this way of presenting science.</p> <p><strong> buttercup23 </strong> <br> If you were prime minister for a day, what would be the one law you would pass to try to restore our relationship with Gaia?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> A few years ago, I published an article in Science,the American equivalent of Nature. In it, I considered what might happen in the 21st century. Perhaps we would go on slowly getting a little more crowded and a little more polluted, but still civilisation would be much as before. Alternatively, we could suffer any one of several catastrophes, such as a volcanic eruption no more severe than Tamboura in 1815 or Laki in Iceland in 1783. These two volcanoes put so much dust into the air that the sun's rays were enfeebled, the earth grew cool and there were two years without harvest. <br> There were then far fewer people in the world, so there were famines, but not enough to destroy civilisation. Just imagine what would happen now. It is said that we have no more than 15-50 days' grain stocks in store at any one time. Two years makes this seem a very short time. <br> So what can we do about it? <br> One thing we can do is to make sure that our successors in the next Dark Age know what we did wrong and have encapsulated in a simple book all the hard-won key facts of science, philosophy, art, etc that would enable them to start the new civilisation. <br> I would like to see the book as a primer for primary-school use to make children familiar with what our civilisation really was. It would be as well-written as the Tyndale bible and kept in every home - thus available, should disaster strike, for our successors.</p> <p><strong>blackbird21</strong><br> The greenhouse effect and the potential damage to the ozone layer has only entered the public consciousness in the last 10 years. With the onset of unleaded petrol and 'environmentally friendly' products, is it really a case of too little too late?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> Too little too late? It may be too late to save civilisation, but people will survive and there will be another one. There were 30 before the present, so why should this one be so special?</p> <p><strong> blackbird21 </strong><br> And what are your views on GM Crops, how do they fit into the gaia theory?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> My feeling about GM crops is that we are straining at a gnat while swallowing the camel of greenhouse-gas accumulation.</p> <p>That's all I have time for - thanks very much and goodbye.</p>",
  "The trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, yesterday pleased opponents of the arms trade by announcing a system of licensing for arms exporters. <p>Campaigners have pressed for legislation for more than two years, but so far ministers have been unable to find time in the legislative timetable. </p> <p>Mr Byers told the conference there was a \"dark and unacceptable side to the arms trade.\" </p> <p>\"That is the irresponsible and immoral trafficking and brokering of arms to conflict zones and areas of instability. </p> <p>\"In this country you need a licence to marry, to go fishing or to drive a car. Yet you don't need a licence to broker and traffic in arms. This cannot be right.\" </p> <p>Arms campaigners including Oxfam and Amnesty International said Mr Byers's announcement was \"a significant advance\" on the 1998 white paper proposals, but urged that legislation be included in the Queen's speech in November. </p> <p>They are likely to be disappointed, since Mr Byers will publish a draft bill, and a final bill is unlikely to find a space in the coming programme. </p> <p>The campaigners want a central data base of UK arms brokers, and all arms sales arranged by them to be subject to licensed approval of the Department of Trade and Industry, as is the case with direct arms exports.</p>",
  "<p>The Jag pulled into the coiffured grounds of France's very own Silicon Valley business development, Eden-Olympia. </p> <p>\"Welcome, Dr Sinclair,\" said Penrose Wilder, the resident psychiatrist, to Jane, my wife. </p> <p>We'd met a few months earlier in hospital after my air crash and were married soon after. She was young, restless; I was middle-aged, semi-crocked and when she had suggested taking up the post in Cannes I had readily agreed, even though we would be living in the shadow of her former colleague - perhaps lover - Dr Greenwood, who had gone berserk while working at Eden and killed seven residents, taken three more hostage, before turning the gun on them and himself. </p> <p>The days passed in anomie. The super-rich kept to themselves, Jane worked 12-hour days, and I walked the trails that led nowhere. It was Halder, the black security guard, that put me on the right track. Greenwood hadn't killed the hostages; they had been his accomplices. </p> <p>Jane and I drifted apart. She injected herself with diamorphine and passed her evenings in the arms of Simone Delarge. I started an affair with Greenwood's former lover, Frances Baring. </p> <p>\"Take me into the bathroom and bugger me,\" she cooed. \"Or how about a golden shower or underage girls? Everyone else is at it here.\" It was true. I had examined Greenwood's crime scene photos and they had told a story of drugs, violence and paedophilia. He wasn't mad. His victims had been chosen. </p> <p>\"You're right,\" Wilder acknowledged. \"But it's the psychopathy that keeps everyone sane. Before we organised the drugs and vice rings and the ratissage on the local immigrants, our top executives were getting ill. But now they are encouraged to indulge their dark side, they are fulfilled. We hardly get any medical problems and corporate profits have soared. Greenwood wanted to expose us on TV, so we had to kill him.\" It had a perverse logic and I couldn't help warming to Wilder, so I decided to keep quiet. But the violence degenerated into murder and Jane into experimental prostitution. Frances and I hadn't seen each other for a few months, and I walked into her flat to find her dead. </p> <p>\"Get away,\" whispered Halder, shuffling me out of the building. \"You're being framed.\" It was time to get Jane home and finish Greenwood's task. </p> <p><strong>And if you really are pressed: The digested read, digested</strong></p> <p>Our protagonist takes a trip to Eden and finds the huge quantities of perverted sex, drugs and violence needed to keep Western capitalism on an even keel.</p>",

  "New details of the army's reactions to Bloody Sunday in Londonderry emerged last night after the IRA leaked a tape-recording, purportedly of conversations in a security force communications centre in the city in the aftermath of the massacre. <p>The IRA has long claimed that for several years it bugged the room in the now-defunct Victoria Barracks in the city. But there was no explanation last night why the critical recording was passed to the Derry Journal only after more than 28 years. </p> <p>According to conversations between security force personnel captured on tape, General Robert Ford, then deputy commanding officer in Northern Ireland, was jubilant at the outcome. Three weeks before Bloody Sunday he had recommended shooting selected ringleaders of the youths who regularly rioted in the city. </p> <p>The Parachute regiment shot dead 13 unarmed Catholics on an illegal civil rights demonstration in Derry on January 30 1972. Another man who was injured died several months later, and the tape will fuel suspicions that the soldiers' actions were pre-meditated. </p> <p>One man recorded in the communication rooms says to another: \"Look there's obviously been a hell of a sort out ... The whole thing's in chaos ... yeah, obviously I think it's gone badly wrong in the Rossville ... the doctor's just been up the hospital and they're pulling the stiffs out there as fast as they can get them out.\" </p> <p>Another replies: \"There's nothing wrong with that, Alan.\" </p> <p>The first man says: \"Well, there is because they're the wrong people ... There's about nine and 15 killed by the Parachute regiment in the Rossville area ... they're all women, children, fuck knows what and they're still going up there ... I mean their pigs [armoured cars] are just full of bodies ... There's a 3-tonner up there with bodies in.\" </p> <p>The second man later says: \"The padre's a bit upset. He's going off to see the commander about all the ill-treatment.\" </p> <p>The first man asks: \"General Ford?\" </p> <p>His companion replies: \"Yeah\" </p> <p>The first man says: \"He was lapping it up.\" </p> <p>Second man: \"Who was?\" </p> <p>First man: \"Ford.\" </p> <p>Second man: \"Was he?\" </p> <p>First man: \"Yeah ... he said it was the best thing he'd seen for a long time.\" </p> <p>Second man: \"Interesting, isn't it?\" </p> <p>First man: \"'Well done, Ist Para,' he said. 'Look at them 24 million dollar'.\" </p> <p>Second man: \"Good excellent.\" </p> <p>First man: \"He said this is what should happen.\" </p> <p>Second man: \"Yeah.\" </p> <p>First man: \"He said we're far too passive ...\" </p> <p>In another exchange, one man in the communications room refers to detachments brought into Derry. He says: \"They've been here over the weekend. We've had a pretty good bloodbath here this evening ... which you'll probably hear on the late news.\" </p> <p>The Derry Journal said it was convinced the tape was authentic. But there was no explanation of why a tape of events three decades old was only now being leaked, when it would have represented a sensational propaganda coup many years ago. </p> <p>The recording includes details of army personnel, phone extensions and equipment which would otherwise be confidential. But there were no independent means last night of confirming its veracity. </p> <p>It also features the voice of Max Hastings. He was then with the BBC, and is now editor of the Evening Standard. </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence refused to comment last night. But it is expected the tape and its transcript, which runs to 25 pages, will be passed to Lord Saville's inquiry before it re-opens in December. </p> <p>There are references in it to the \"beautiful picture\" of a priest over a man lying dead on the ground; to longstanding allegations rioters brought out an already dead body, of a girl, falsely to boost casualty rates, and examples of black humour in the room. </p> <p>Under pressure from journalists, one of the men in the centre offers a version of events in Derry. He says those on the march bombarded troops with milk bottles and iron bars. They then threw some CS grenades at the mili tary, who donned respirators. </p> <p>In an area touching on the key controversy, the man says that when the subsequent arrest operation began \"gunmen opened fire ... from the rubble ... at the base of Rossville flats ... and the soldiers returned fire casualties have been reported. The military have suffered casualties from the severe stoning they underwent\". </p> <p>When Mr Hastings calls from Belfast, he asks: \"I was just going to ask what the latest score was.\" He later says: \"I just don't mean how many were killed how many soldiers were killed?\" </p> <p>He is told all the casualties are civilians. He is also told that the Parachute regiment was only in the Bogside, where the shootings took place, for a \"short, devastating moment\". </p> <p>Although no figure is offered for casualties, Mr Hastings says: \"We may have to come back to Derry if your soldiers carry on shooting people at such a remarkable rate.\" </p> <p>The man replies: \"Ha ha ha. Well, yes, I'm from Belfast myself and I think it is a very good trend myself.\" </p> <p>Mr Hastings says: \"It's something I would have thought the Bogside might take a rather dim view of myself, but anyway, many thanks.\"</p>",
  "The government is reeling from a major setback after the House of Lords killed a bill curbing a defendant's right to jury trial. <p>Rebel Labour peers backed a Tory amendment after a stormy and impassioned debate on the second reading of the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) bill. It was the second time that Home secretary Jack Straw has tried and failed to push through the controversial legislation, aimed at saving money and speeding up the logjam in the courts. </p> <p>But a cross-party alliance of peers, including three former law lords, Lord Ackner, Lord Donaldson and Lord Simon of Glaisdale, spoke against the government. </p> <p>The government could use the Parliament Act to steamroller the same bill into law in the next sessions. But Labour rebels, including Baroness Kennedy of the Shaws QC warned the Government that \"would be seen as a terrible display of arrogance\". </p> <p>The Home office said the government was determined to press ahead with the measure. A spokesman said: \"We will not be deterred by the opposition of the House of Lords. We have already introduced this bill twice this session, and we will bring forward further legislation when Parliamentary time allows. </p> <p>\"The bill represents a modest but important modernisation of our criminal justice system, to speed up justice in the interests of victims, witnesses and the public at large.\" </p> <p>Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe said the vote was \"another slap down for the Home Secretary and overwhelming evidence of the arrogance at the heart of New Labour - the party who never listen.\" </p> <p>\"Jack Straw should have listened the first time the House of Lords rejected his foolish measures. Thank goodness that they at least have stood up for common sense and voted to keep this vital tenet of British justice.\" </p> <p>Earlier the Attorney general urged the House of Lords to back the bill which would have ended the right of about 18,000 defendants a year in England and Wales to choose whether to be tried by a jury. </p> <p>Instead, magistrates would choose where people charged with middle-ranking offences should be tried. Lord Williams of Mostyn said: \"Cases which involve allegations of serious crime should not be held up, I suggest, by cases which, judged objectively, do not merit a Crown court trial. </p> <p>\"If we wish to have a criminal justice system that not only has something to do with crime and something to do with justice, but wishes to become systematic, then we ought to give these proposals an open-minded reception,\" he said. </p> <p>Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: \"If ever there was a case for the Government saying it was wrong now is the time. </p> <p>\"A government which claims to be committed to human rights and civil liberties cannot go on threatening one of the oldest rights of all.\" end</p>",
  "<p>How are businesses gearing up for a new kind of consumer power that is emerging from the electronic revolution?</p> <p>I undertook research on behalf of Marketing Forum 2000 to answer that question and found real dilemmas for marketing and businesses in their quest to come to terms with the growth in consumer power heralded by changes in electronic media.</p> <p>The research, which was conducted among both marketers and consumers, found that the rules of marketing haven't fundamentally changed but many of the processes marketers use are now too bureaucratic and ponderous.</p> <p>Some companies are simply hiving off the electronic division to keep the 'e-types' from being too disruptive a force in the existing corporate culture. This is, in effect, a kind of corporate denial. A better solution is to embrace the need for change and become quicker and less bureaucratic. Size is important in the e-world but speed and agility are vital too. The winners will be those companies that succeed in combining both.</p> <p>There are implications for ways of working too. In the words of one senior marketer: \"This is the death of precedent.\" Everyone in marketing will have to find quicker, more original ways of working with more emphasis on creativity. This should, surely, be the perfect climate for agencies. While the marketing community is undergoing a revolution, agencies - which have traditionally seen themselves as the natural business partners of marketing clients - are turning into dinosaurs. They have not risen to the challenge of adapting to meet the rapidly changing needs of their customers.</p> <p>The web agencies fared even worse and were seen as \"the dot.coms of the agency world - entrepreneurial, ambitious but lacking substance\".</p> <p>However, the problem is not only for agencies. As far as consumers are concerned, few companies are getting their electronic offering right. There is too much emphasis on design and too little on functionality in websites. One of the consumer respondents summed it up: \"Your website is your shop - whether or not you are planning to sell from it. Most people who visit are looking for information and help and they need to be given it. Then they may stay to browse and even buy. If they don't like the feel of your place, they have the biggest shopping mall in the world on their desktop.\"</p> <p>However, this pales into insignificance against the biggest single conclusion from this research. We are witnessing the start of a seismic shift in the balance of power in marketing. We are only feeling the first distant rumbles, but as more people become e-enabled the closer we will get to the epicentre of a major earthquake that has the potential to shake the very foundations on which marketing has been built.</p> <p>The marketing industry may soon look back with nostalgia at the good \"old\" world ruled by brands and built on inspiring confidence and reflecting consumer aspirations. Since the arrival of the e-world there has been much talk of building deeper relationships based on the previously undreamed of quality and quantity of data, providing a new depth of knowledge and the ability to anticipate consumer needs.</p> <p>Attractive as this model may seem to today's marketers, based on the consumer research, I believe it is unlikely that this will be the future of marketing. While it is no news that the new, emergent e-consumer is becoming empowered, marketing has not yet fully understood the implications of meeting the needs of consumers who feel omnipotent rather than in awe. In fact, this sense of omnipotence is not usually a response to marketing. It often comes on the back of a bigger need, such as trying to find out about a medical condition affecting a family member. It takes persistence and a degree of acquired skill to become really competent on the web. But this type of stimulus leads consumers to push through the pain barrier and once they have done so there is no turning back.</p> <p>There is a glint in the eye and an almost belligerent attitude among those consumers who have \"cracked\" the web. Marketers and brands really need to understand this phenomenon. Never before have consumers understood that they have the power over a medium and by extension over brands. In the words of just one web-literate consumer \"What's fundamentally exciting is that we are controlling it, we are defining how it grows. We don't control the way other media work but we are controlling this and it's immensely exciting.\" People power is on the increase. Governments can't afford to ignore it and neither can brands and this means marketing needs to change beyond recognition.</p> <p>Lindsey Roberts is founding partner of the FRESH ideas consultancy.

  "<p> There is a growing swell of support for important political issues to be decided by referendum. It is an honourable case, and the trend is probably irreversible. But there are dangers and pitfalls too. </p> <p>The theory which underpins Britain's famously unwritten constitution is that supreme authority rests with the monarch in parliament. In practice, that cosy concept has been dead for more than 300 years, ever since parliament finally asserted its supremacy in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. </p> <p>In more recent times, parliament's authority has been hugely eroded by the more amorphous concept of the will of the people. Through the 19th century, a series of electoral reforms extended the franchise across all classes, and ensured that every voter had more or less equal influence (that is, tiny) over the make-up of the House of Commons. </p> <p>However, universal suffrage - one person, one vote - was introduced only in the late 20s, with the enfranchisement of women on equal terms. Popular democracy is therefore in its infancy, in historical terms, although we have become used for centuries to the comfortable notion that we are all represented in our parliament. </p> <p>It is that central idea which is threatened by referendums. For ultimately, if we are to decide the great issues of the day ourselves, the importance of our elected representatives is automatically diminished. It could be argued that the authority of MPs has already been grievously eroded by power-hungry executives, our present government being a pretty good example. </p> <p>Following that line of argument, it may be that we need more referendums so that we can occasionally kick our beloved rulers where it hurts - as in the London mayoral election this year. </p> <p>The danger is that if we pare away yet more of our MPs' authority, we will automatically be weakening the only real check on the executive in our system: the House of Commons. It would be credulous to argue that the government will and should be answerable to the will of the people. It is also rather scary to speculate the outcome of that will, were it to be given unfettered expression. </p> <p>For where would we draw the line on what kind of issues are suitable to be put before the people? Those involving constitutional change, certainly, such as the devolution votes in Scotland and Wales, and the 1975 vote on membership of what was the EEC. </p> <p>The case for a referendum on the single currency is much more dubious, as it involves no fundamental constitutional change - whatever the huffing and puffing patriots say. Already, it is plain that whatever the wording of the question and however the campaign is conducted, the vote will be seen as endorsement or rejection of the EU itself. In that sense, it will be a perilous irrelevance. </p> <p>And if the case for going to the people is so strong, why stop with the poor old euro? Should we not have a chance - all of us - to choose our prime minister, given the swollen importance of that office? Could we perhaps be consulted on tax rates and other key budget proposals? Or freedom of information? Or capital punishment? </p> <p>No thanks. That way lies a slippery slope, leading to a mire of cheap populism. Better by far that we stick to our elected representatives, encouraging them from time to time by kicking their backsides in general elections. </p> <p>The problem with that is that our parliament, collectively, is wildly unrepresentative of the electoral will of the people, and will remain so until there is a fair voting system.</p> <p>New Labour, terrified by the idea that it would be no longer possible for a party to achieve a majority of 179 with just 44% of the vote, is slithering away from its pre-election commitment to a referendum on reform. Now that would be a referendum worth having. </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/EMU/\">Special report: economic and monetary union</a><br><a href=\"http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/rodmell/\">Direct Democracy Campaign</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.charter88.org.uk/pubs/reinven/reinvote.html\">Charter 88: the case for a referendum on the voting system</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/3b8wTa8t/editorial/freeforall/19990814/bb7044.html\">Economist essay on referendums</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.aceproject.org/main/english/es/esc01a/default.htm\">Referendums and plebiscites</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.antiwar.com/stone/stone051200.html\">A model democracy?</a></p>",
  "<p>The chances of early British membership of the euro have diminished markedly as a result of yesterday's no vote in the Danish referendum. And rightly so. For all the talk about the single currency being part of an inevitable historical process it is quite obvious that many people across Europe see the euro as a bad idea. When given the opportunity to vote on it, they don't like it.</p> <p>There are three good reasons why the Blair government should give the single currency a wide berth. First, there is the economic argument. The euro's value has plummeted by more than 25% since its launch in January 1999 dashing hopes that it would be a rock-solid currency. </p> <p>Moreover, the one-size-fits-all interest rate for the 11 member countries has meant that the cost of borrowing is too low in some countries - witness Ireland's inflation rate of more than 6% - and too high in others, particularly Germany. Had Britain joined the euro at its inception, the result would have been high inflation in the short term and a very serious recession in the long term.</p> <p>Second, there is the democratic argument. One of the main factors in the Danish referendum was the sense among voters that they wanted more control over their lives, rather than ceding decision-making to remote, unaccountable and centralised bodies. </p> <p>In Britain, the government's recent difficulties have been as much about the backlash against what people see as top-down decision-making by an out-of-touch elite as it has been about the nuances of policy. On road fuel tax, on the Dome, and on pensions, the government did not listen. It must make sure it does over the euro, because as the Danes have illustrated, it is no longer possible for the great and the good - either at national, European or global level - to dictate policy over the heads of the people.</p> <p>Finally, there is the political argument. In Denmark, the entire political, media and business establishment was for the euro, yet the yes camp still lost convincingly. In Britain, where the balance of forces for and against the single currency is much more even and opinion polls show a deep scepticism about monetary union, the government has to acknowledge that it could lose a referendum by a thumping majority. </p> <p>If that happened, Mr Blair's administration would be broken: it would lose its moral authority and find it much harder to push through its domestic agenda of improving public services, tackling poverty and raising living standards. </p> <p>In the end, the government will probably conclude that the potential costs of a lost referendum far outweigh the nebulous benefits of winning one against the odds. And it will be right.</p>",
  "<p>The government today insisted that yesterday's rejection of the euro by the Danish people does not affect its own plans to hold a referendum after the next general election.</p> <p>The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, argued today that if the economic circumstances were deemed to be conducive to joining the euro, it would be \"irresponsible\" not to hold a poll on joining the single currency. Economic considerations for the euro were important for Britain however difficult it might be to make the political case, Mr Cook said.</p> <p>But the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, said the Danish vote was an important watershed in resistance to the single currency, shooting a hole in the argument that joining the euro was an inevitability.</p> <p>Pointing out the economic benefits of the eurozone, Mr Cook said: \"The vote last night does not alter in any way the fundamental fact that the eurozone contains 250m people who provide the market for the majority of our exports, and that there are 5,000 American and Japanese companies which invest here because they want to export to that market.\" </p> <p>He said the chief executive of Nissan had warned recently that there was a question mark over whether the company could site production of a new model at its Sunderland plant because Britain was not part of the euro. </p> <p>\"Those are the critical, crucial questions that will weigh with the British people, who will make the decision on what is right for Britain, not what is right for Denmark,\" Mr Cook continued. </p> <p>\"I find it rather odd that those very people who stress sovereignty, who stress the right of Britain to make independent decisions, seem this morning to be saying that Denmark should decide for Britain. It shouldn't. Britain should decide for itself, and I think it would be very unwise for us to close off the option. </p> <p>\"If the chancellor does decide that there would be economic advantages of going in, I think it would be very irresponsible for the government now to say that even if he reaches that decision, we are not going to ask the British people,\" the foreign secretary told Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme Mr Portillo said the result of the Danish referendum proved there was nothing inevitable about joining the single currency. \"I think there has been an important change with this referendum, and that is that the only arguments that were really made in favour about going in, were that we should be fearful in some way of being left out, fearful of being isolated,\" he said. \"Well of course we are not now isolated, other people in Europe have taken the same view.</p> <p>\"The other argument was that it was somehow inevitable that we would join the euro. Well, it clearly isn't inevitable. It is within the capability of the British people to vote no if they are offered that chance in a referendum.\"</p>",
  "The government will today unveil a \"memorandum of understanding\", agreed with the oil companies and police, aimed at securing essential fuel supplies in the event of further blockades. <p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, who heads the government's fuel taskforce, was set to publish details of the agreement after it was formally endorsed by ministers and representatives of the industry and the police.</p> <p>In a statement to the House of Lords yesterday, transport minister Lord Macdonald said it would cover the practical arrangements for the co-ordination and co-operation needed to protect essential services.</p> <p>Government sources said it would include the development of joint early-warning and crisis-management systems, as well as dealing with the intimidation of tanker drivers. </p> <p>The taskforce had also been looking at the oil companies' contractual arrangements with the tanker drivers, most of whom are self-employed, which made it difficult for the companies to order them to cross the blockades.</p> <p>The taskforce was also looking at the options for new legislation, giving the police greater powers to deal with public disorder and imposing a legal duty on the oil companies to maintain essential supplies. </p> <p>Lord Macdonald stressed, however, that the government would continue to respect workers' rights under employment legislation as well as the right to peaceful protest. </p> <p>He emphasised that ministers, who had faced accusations that they were arrogant and out of touch, were listening to the concerns of the protesters. </p> <p>The \"existing channels\" of communication with the haulage industry would be kept open during the consultation process, leading up to the pre-Budget report from the chancellor, Gordon Brown, Lord Macdonald said.</p> <p>But he warned that the government would not be dictated to by the protesters, who have threatened to resume their blockades if there was no cut in fuel duty within 60 days.</p>",
  "With barely-concealed glee that the high price of oil has restored the power of the Opec cartel, Venezuela's charismatic president, Hugo Chavez, has used the group's first summit in 25 years to stake his claim as the self-appointed leader of the developing world. <p>\"He is definitely living his days of glory. He sees himself as a world leader and Opec has given him the springboard. I don't think he could be happier,\" said Roberto Bottome, president of the consultancy firm Veneconomy. </p> <p>In a key speech combining revolutionary rhetoric with folksy references to Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the Hindu philosopher Krishna Murta, Mr Chavez rallied leaders of the other 10 Opec countries - including the presidents of Nigeria, Indonesia, Algeria and Iran - to demand justice from industrialised countries. </p> <p>\"We cannot allow that once again we be indicted as guilty for the imbalance of the world,\" he said in defence of high oil prices. \"We are victims of the imbalances of the world economy. We are not at fault.\" </p> <p>Mr Chavez compared the price of oil to the price of barrels of Coca-Cola, ice cream, shampoo and Tabasco. \"A barrel of good wine is worth, you know how much? $1,370 - 450% [more than oil]. This is almost laughable, but let's tell the truth to the whole world.\" </p> <p>The Opec meeting, which ended in the Venezuelan capital Caracas last night, was Mr Chavez's party. He has been the cartel's loudest voice since he took office in February last year, when oil was $13 a barrel and Opec was mired in bickering over quotas. </p> <p>Mr Chavez received an unexpected cash windfall when the cost of a barrel more than tripled after reaching a low of $8. It has sparked a recovery in the Venezuelan economy and has enabled the former coup leader to project himself as a combative new voice on the international stage. </p> <p>Janet Kelly, professor of public policy at the Institute for Higher Administrative Studies in Caracas, said: \"[Chavez] came to office during the worst circumstances you could imagine. That the oil situation turned around last year has been manna from heaven. It has helped him in every way imaginable.\" </p> <p>In the same way as the forceful Mr Chavez has taken control of Venezuelan institutions, so industry analysts credit him with bringing discipline to the traditionally fractious cartel. </p> <p>This year he toured all Opec countries to invite them to the summit. He took delight in irritating the west by being the first head of state to visit Saddam Hussein in Baghdad since the Gulf war. </p> <p>The timing of the summit has coincided with protests in Europe about pump prices, adding to Opec's reinvigorated sense of importance. \"The eyes of the world are upon us,\" Mr Chavez said. \"Everyone is attentive to what we do, what we discuss, what we decide.\" </p> <p>He argues that high taxes and market speculation, not supply, are the reasons for prices rises. In his view, Opec should serve as a bulwark against the economic imperialism he sees as damaging to developing countries. He also wants Opec to tackle foreign debts, terms of trade and other issues for poor countries. </p> <p>The purpose of this week's summit was less about addressing the west's fears about high prices than strengthening ties within Opec. </p> <p>The summit is only the second in Opec's 40-year history because the organisation has been complicated by wars between members - Iran and Iraq in the 1980s and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. </p> <p>The only visible crack in the united front in Caracas was when the seating plan was hastily changed to move Saudi Arabia's crown prince from next to Iraq's vice-president. </p> <p>According to oil experts, the Opec countries were revelling in their moment of importance because a future drop in the oil price was inevitable. \"Market reality will reassert itself,\" one said. \"Then I don't know what will happen but it will be pretty messy. Chavez will get egg on his face.\" </p> <p>Whereas Saudi Arabia, the most influential and least hawkish Opec country, was preaching moderation, other countries were rallying to Mr Chavez's anti-imperialist cry. </p> <p>\"In many countries the tax on oil has become an important means for financing their various projects instead of looking for other sources of income,\" said Qatar's foreign minister, Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem Bin Jabor al-Thani. </p> <p>Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, denounced what he called the new \"world attitude\", adding that Opec countries were \"waiting for international financial institutions to give all countries an equal opportunity\".</p>",
  "<p>News that oil prices have slipped below $30 a barrel for the first time in more than a month was a welcome finale yesterday to this week's Caracas summit of leaders of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. </p> <p>A promise by Saudi Arabia to pump more crude if necessary was the catalyst, but the increasing recognition by even the most hardline Opec states that current prices are not sustainable helped to convince the markets that the only way for crude is down. </p> <p>The Caracas meeting was a cheerful affair with oil producers enjoying bumper revenues - courtesy of the sky-high price of crude - created, in turn, by last year's production cuts as well as the continuing strength of the big western economies. Opec is a force to be reckoned with on the world political stage for the first time in a generation. Some members, particularly Venezuela, which holds the chairmanship, are clearly revelling in the discomfort they are inflicting on oil consumers. </p> <p>But despite the hard-edged mood music, most Opec members realise that squeezing the west too hard on prices risks killing the proverbial goose. A recession in the west would hurt Opec as well, and higher prices make oil fields outside the cartel's control viable. </p> <p>In fact, most analysts believe that prices are heading to somewhere closer to Opec's goal of between $22 and $28. The physical market is awash with oil and much of the problem has been in the futures market, which has been buffeted by worries about winter shortages. </p> <p>Saudi Arabia's promise to pump more oil if necessary yesterday was largely a public relations gesture - they do not anticipate being called upon to act. Rather it was a reaction to the US move to release its strategic reserves last week, and muttering this week that the EU might follow suit. The message from the Saudis was simple: if any extra oil is needed for the world economy, they will be the ones providing it. </p> <p><strong> Regulatory woe </strong><br> </p> <p> There is stress in the world of regulation. In Britain, Oftel has found itself deep in the spaghetti over the introduction of high speed telecoms services and its mangled dealings with BT. </p> <p>Ofwat has had its rulings overturned by the competition commission, which decided some of the price cuts it had imposed on two small water companies were unfair. </p> <p>Ofgen, perhaps in response, has lightened the load on National Grid - raising the company's assumed cost of capital, and in the process increasing the Grid's profitability. </p> <p>At the same time, Camelot has succeeded in convincing the high court that the lottery commission acted incompetently in giving Sir Richard Branson's People's Lottery an extra month to get its act together when Camelot's application had simply been declared void. </p> <p>Yesterday, the financial services authority in London seemed completely thrown by accusations coming out of Germany that one of the big banks in its regulatory backyard had stolen a march on last week's bout of euro-intervention, making many millions in the process. There was no sense that any sort proactive investigation of the claims was under way. </p> <p>And now, over in Brussels, the hitherto unquestioned word of Mario Monti is now being challenged by Worldcom, the American telecoms group which aborted its $130bn merger with rival Sprint in the summer after the European commission ruled that the move would stifle competition in the crucial business of connecting to the internet in Europe. </p> <p>Worldcom now says the regulators \"fundamentally misperceived both how internet services are provided and the highly competitive nature of the internet marketplace\". </p> <p>Taking the high ground, the American telcoms company believes it has been compelled to appeal \"so that the decision does not become the basis for future commission actions\". </p> <p>The decision in the summer was the first time the commission has blocked a merger of companies not based within the European Union. </p> <p>Naturally, the EU was coming over all confident yesterday, certain that its findings would stand up to any legal challenge. But this is a crucial matter, nevertheless, potentially triggering all number of copycat actions. </p> <p>There are common themes to all this: as businesses think and act globally, they no longer feel automatically subordinate to local authorities. </p> <p>At the same time local regulators are feeling emasculated, and every time they try to beef up their potency by linking together, it ends in tears. </p> <p>However, unless there are moves to standardise regulation and develop internationally respected arbitration procedures - across Europe, obviously, but also with the United States - the result is likely to be simply be more and more litigation.</p>",
  "<b>This is the full text of an interview by the Guardian's Asia correspondent Luke Harding with Benazir Bhutto's millionaire husband Asif Ali Zardari, who has spent the last three years in jail in Pakistan on corruption charges and faces a fresh trial in connection with Rockwood Park, a mansion in Surrey which the authorities say he bought using drug money. In his first ever interview with a British newspaper, Zardari, the husband of the former Pakistani prime minister, denies corruption but says he did behave 'improperly'. He graphically describes being tortured in custody but avoids any direct criticism of the military regime and says he misses his wife, in self-imposed exile in London.</b> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Mr Zardari, you recently spent your 47th birthday in custody. How have you coped with three years in prison and enforced separation from your wife and family?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> I turned 46 in July and it was my fourth consecutive birthday in prison. I have spent seven of the 12 years I have been married a victim of political persecution. I must be the first male spouse being held hostage by a regime. I accept this as Pakistan has traditional elements who find it hard to reconcile with a man whose wife works and who other men salute perforce of her office. It is difficult to cope without the company of my wife and children, my family and friends. I miss the joy of a father in seeing his children grow, the opportunity to walk in the garden, to visit the dust and heat of my constituency Nawabshah, to meet with members of my tribe and my political colleagues, to laugh with my friends, to visit a shop and buy a magazine or compete in a polo match. As an independent person, I find it difficult being dependent for everything, for even my food and medicine, to the prison authorities. I have had to fight through the courts for everything, including even physiotherapy which is my right under the jail manual.</p> <p>When I married, many warned me of the difficulties that would come my way. However, I greatly admired my father in law, prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. I draw inspiration by thinking of him and the greater difficulties he endured. I think of the PPP workers lashed and sent to the gallows. I want our martyrs and our workers to be proud of me in that I upheld the legacy of a great party committed to upholding human dignity. I pray to God to give me the courage to face the hardship and the humiliation that comes with prison life and the false accusations made against me.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> It is claimed that your prison life is luxurious. Could you describe your surroundings and what comforts- if any - you have?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> It is incorrect that my prison life is luxurious. As a child I was spoilt by my parents as an only son. They indulged my every whim and I grew up in luxury. My prison cell is a far cry from that luxury. It is spartan and particularly difficult during the hot summer months. Most of the time I have been in physical pain caused by the increasing nerve compression aggravated through neglected medical treatment. The courts freed me on medical bail two years back, but the regime opposed it. Solitary confinement makes it difficult for time to pass. Over the years, I won some bare improvements through many petitions and court proceedings through various high courts. These included a cooler after one year, a radio/television after eighteen months. Other prisoners have generous visiting rights and other facilities such as mixing with each other to pass the time as a matter of entitlement. These entitlements have been denied to me despite order of courts. I felt discriminated against.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Several charges of corruption have been levelled against you, yet no charges have been proved. Do you accept any of the allegations made and are you confident you will eventually receive a fair trial?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> The charges of corruption against me are baseless. I never broke a single law nor exploited my wife's position. It was the practice for chief executives to favour their families. General Zia gave prime property to his sons and even sons in law in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Prime minister Junejo gave his son a sugar mill at the concessional rate of three per cent. Prime Minister Jatoi also gave his family members prime property in Islamabad. Prime minister Nawaz Sharif took loans from public sector banks to make about 30 factories. President Leghari got back 40,000 acres of land during his presidentship and reportedly assisted his family members in bank loans. My wife should be credited with breaking from that tradition. I neither took a loan, nor prime property nor influenced the award of contracts.</p> <p>Before my marriage I was a businessman in trading, construction and hotelling. As the spouse of the prime minister, I refused even credit from public sector banks, borrowing instead from the markets. I had money and was more interested in the political success of the PPP. I may have behaved improperly in being extravagant or in allowing access to friends to the prime minister's house. However, I scrupulously adhered to the law of the land. In future, I will be more careful than in the past in allowing access as I have learnt many bitter lessons and realise that the prime minister's spouse must be above suspicion. Even if there isn't a fire, smoke makes people suspicious and I end up paying the price.</p> <p>I would like the so-called charges against me put up for scrutiny before independent jurists or chartered accountants. The documents before the court placed by the prosecution are enough to show the total lack of evidence. They fail the test of evidentiary admissibility and show how an attempt has been made to pervert the course of justice. Reputed Queens Counsel from Britain has opined that I did not get a fair (trial) in the SGS case [Societe General de Suisse, a corruption case last year] in which a mistrial took place. The case is currently under appeal. I hope interested observers will come to witness the proceedings. </p> <p>My whole family was made to suffer. My father was arrested, my sister's house raided in the early hours of the morning, my wife dragged from court room to court room, my brother in law arrested eight consecutive times, my secretary tortured until one eye was permanently damaged, my former bodyguards tortured and imprisoned. I too was subjected to military torture under the directions of President Leghari and to police torture under Nawaz Sharif where my neck and throat were cut in a bid to make me implicate my wife. I was taken to the hospital when it was presumed I would die from cardiac arrest. I feel God has given me a second life. I want to live up to the new standards of transparency and openness which the youth of today demand of their leaders.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Your friends say you have not been well recently. Could you describe what health problems you have suffered and why?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> I suffer from spinal problems which have worsened through imprisonment. The lack of proper treatment has led to further nerve compression and I have lost weight as a consequence. My eyes have also suffered due to the long nights when I was made to stand under blazing lights and denied sleep. I would be woken at odd times in the night to be taken to airports in overheated armoured vehicles. The pain from the spinal problem and the disorientation of being denied sleep and proper medical attention led to hypertension and I am in need of specialised treatment. The supreme court of Pakistan has observed that I can only be treated properly in hospital and not in prison. Had I been given proper medical treatment in the first place then my health would not have suffered so badly. Again the denial of such treatment was a continuation of the government policy of victimising me.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Like you, Nawaz Sharif is now in prison. Do you have any sympathy for the former prime minister and what is your opinion of Pakistan's new military regime?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> Mr Nawaz Sharif dug his own grave by taking on the PPP in a fascist fashion. Murder cases were trumped up against me, as well as other charges, and I was threatened with a death sentence many times over through special laws and special terrorist courts. Ironically, Nawaz Sharif was tried by the same laws he had made against me, tried through the precedent of different provincial jurisdictions that he had made for my party, put in the same prison cell, threatened with a death sentence by the terrorist courts he had made for me and made to travel in the same armoured personnel carrier. </p> <p>His trial venue was in front of my residence Bilawal House which he had to pass every day. He had wanted the army to try me and hang me but I fought it to the supreme court and in a way saved Nawaz Sharif's life. When he was overthrown he was spared being tried by an army officer. Now he is even turning to the lawyers which had been defending me to defend him. I hope that Nawaz Sharif emerges as a better person through the prison ordeal as he is now paying the price of what he did to others. </p> <p>Whilst I was personally tortured and nearly poisoned by the Sharif brothers, I am a political animal and as such would like to look at the political concept rather than the inhuman treatment meted out to me. I believe it is wrong to prejudge and criminalise political leaders and deny them the due process of law. Therefore, the treatment being meted out to Nawaz Sharif, my party colleagues, other political leaders and to myself is one which I find hard to accept.</p> <p>I do feel sad when I see Mrs Kulsoom Sharif going from city to city. Pakistan is a country where women are revered and respected as sisters and mothers. Our country is shamed when its rulers refuse to show respect even for our mothers and daughters irrespective of political differences.</p> <p>As far as the military regime is concerned, it has yet to make any new cases against me. It has not carried out a media campaign of vilification or taken out advertisements in the newspapers against me.</p> <p>Whilst it has denied me any relief despite calling the last accountability politically motivated, it has not added to the mountain of persecution launched by the previous regime.</p> <p>I went to a cadet college for my education and I admire the discipline, determination and professionalism which an army officer brings to his job. However, the army is taught to defend a country not govern it. I would like to see the generals discuss an exit strategy to go back to the barracks. The situation in the country is much as it was under Nawaz Sharif. The declaration of building the Kalabagh Dam can only alienate the smaller provinces further as their elected assemblies have rejected it.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> The British builder Paul Keating claims he met you on several occasions to supervise the refurbishment of Rockwood House, a mansion in Surrey. Did you ever meet Paul Keating and does Rockwood House belong to you? If not, do you have any objection to the property being used by the Pakistan High Commission in London?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> I wonder how this question is relevant to the accusations of corruption against me. Even if the prosecution story is accepted that the Surrey House belongs to me, which is unproved in a court of law in Pakistan, I am a businessman with my own sources of income. The regime has to show that I did a corrupt act and bought a property through a corrupt act. Instead the regime wrongly claimed I was in the narcotics trade and bought a house with that. </p> <p>The co-accused in the narcotics case have judicially declared that they were tortured to make the statements against me which they have withdrawn before the judge. I come from a respectable and old family. My father is the head of Zardari tribe and I am his only son. My family has been landowners for a long time with our family mausoleum going back one millennium. We are involved in construction and trading with expensive properties in the heart of Karachi. During the Zia era, the Zardari Group won a contract for a hotel in Rawalpindi near the golf course, a prime property. </p> <p>Our business has suffered setbacks due to my incarceration and that of my father. I have been in prison for seven years of my 12 years of marriage. Before I got married, I had my private polo team and led a privileged life. I have faced hardship over privilege with dignity despite the special laws and special courts constituted to persecute me due to my martial status. I was kidnapped from prison and physically tortured and nearly killed in 1999. Under Farooq Leghari, in December 1996, I was given sleep deprivation torture, [light] was shone in my eyes despite my having undergone an eye operation. I have borne the hardship because I am fighting for my reputation, that of my family, tribe, province and country. To err is human but I have never broken the laws.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Are you able to communicate with your wife at all, either by phone or letter? How demoralising is it for you that she is unable presently to return to Pakistan?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> I do try and communicate with my wife and children by sending them flowers and cards with short messages. I receive letters from them and even poetry from my children which is read to me during the court break and always cheers me enormously. Absence only makes the heart grow fonder. I sometimes ask for photos to be sent to me so that I can see what they look like and how they are growing. I do miss the children. I am a Balauch. When I was young I was told that Balauch fathers do not see their children when they are young because the children can become the weakness of a strong man. I have not seen my children much but they are still my weakness. I try not to think of my wife and children because when I do I become sentimental.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Do you think the PPP will be able to recover from its current setbacks and do you think you and your wife might have a role to play in government when democracy is restored to Pakistan?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> Yes, I do think the PPP will recover from its current setbacks. When my wife was here, she would tell me how the party was discussing remodelling itself on the lines of New Labour to win back those supporters who had become disenchanted. We lost the government due to internal treachery of an overambitious and not very intelligent man. The country prospered under the PPP with its growth rate tripling, national revenues doubling, literacy increasing, population growth rates decreasing as well as infant mortality rates. </p> <p>The poor know that the PPP is their watchdog as do the discriminated classes. My wife has enormous stamina and a motivation to fight against injustice. She is intelligent and experienced, articulate and sensitive. She loves the poor people and the country. I know she will lead the PPP to victory because the PPP is the only national democratic and liberal party which has the programme to turn around the external and internal crisis and also has popular sanction. The support of the people for the PPP is evident in labour elections, bar elections, community meetings and other forums. Its workers are battle hardened activists who have repeatedly faced tyranny with courage and are dedicated to the uplift of the common man.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Is there anything else you feel people outside Pakistan, and in Britain in particular, should know about your case?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> I studied in Britain and spent great moments of my life there as a student living in Belsize Park. I admire the British trait of the stiff upper lip in the face of adversity. My wife studied in Britain too and both of us have many friends there. We take pride in the tolerant society of Britain which has enabled immigrants to climb the pinnacles of success in business and politics, including the houses of parliament. I would like to see such tolerance and accommodation in Pakistan.</p> <p>At a time when the entire forces of the state were unleashed against me in the press accusing me of murder and corruption and every sin under the earth, it was the British legal system which came to my rescue. It ruled that the Home Office would have to provide me the papers relating to evidence gathering as asked about by Pakistan. it overwhelms me when I think of that moment as it enabled me to fight back. Armed with that information, I have argued that the Islamabad authorities are seeking to abuse international treaties with a view to pervert the course of justice in Pakistan.</p> <p>The British decision to support democracy in Pakistan and its reluctance to offer legal assistance to the Pakistani authorities which fall short of the law have been welcomed by the Pakistan Peoples Party.</p> <p>I would like to say to the British: you have heard many things about me. Some False, some distorted, some true. I am not the devil that has been painted in the press although I am not an angel either. I am a human being with the frailties that accompany it. I may have made mistakes but I have kept away from illegal activity. I was a young man who married Islam's first woman Prime Minister little realising the publicity and power it would unleash and the storm of controversy I would be thrown into. More than a decade down the line, I am a different person and deserve a second chance. In particular from the large number of British Pakistanis and other Asians who follow with interest and concern what happens in Pakistan.</p>",
  "<p>Celtic clinched their place in the draw for the second round despite being given an almighty scare by HJK Helsinki. The Parkhead club came into the game with a two-goal cushion from the first leg, only to see it wiped out as Paulus Roiha scored twice for the Finns to send the tie into extra-time. </p> <p>But Chris Sutton was in the right place at the right time to rescue Celtic's European ambitions just when a penalty shoot-out appeared inevitable. It was Martin O'Neill's first defeat since taking control of the club 13 games ago but he was a relieved man at the final whistle. </p> <p>The poor state of the pitch made the roll of the ball a lottery at times, but Celtic could not blame the surface when, in the fourth minute, they almost suffered a nightmare start. </p> <p>Peter Kopteff took Toni Kallio's clever flick in his stride down the HJK left and hit a cross that had Jonathan Gould desperately scurrying back across his goal-line. The Celtic keeper was relieved to see the ball bounce off the top of the crossbar. </p> <p>Celtic responded and struck the woodwork themselves when Stilian Petrov ran on to Paul Lambert's through-ball and hit the post, Henrik Larsson curling the rebound wide. </p> <p>But the visitors suffered a blow 10 minutes before half-time when their captain Tom Boyd was carried off with a knee injury, and six minutes later HJK were back in the tie. Aleksei Yeremenko played Roiha through and the 20-year-old comfortably slid the ball past the onrushing Gould. </p> <p>Gould denied Roiha four minutes after the interval but disaster struck in the 75th minute when the young striker levelled the tie after a blunder by the Celtic keeper. Gould saved a shot but spilled the ball into the path of Roiha, who side-footed home off the post. </p> <p>Six minutes into extra-time Lubomir Moravcik cut in from the left and hit a rasping drive which came back off the upright, but Celtic were rewarded in the 117th minute when Moravcik fired across the face of goal and Sutton slid in for the clincher. </p> <p> <strong> HJK Helsinki: </strong> Vieander; Turpeinen, Nylund, Yeremenko, Kallio, Roiha, Saarinen, Heikkinen, Hakanpaa, Kuivasto, Kopteff. </p> <p><strong> Celtic: </strong> Gould; Boyd, McNamara, Valgaeren, Larsson, Sutton, Berkovic, Lambert, Petta, Petrov, Mjallby. </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> L Gadosi (Slovakia). </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Leicester's foray into Europe ended in the most bitter fashion in Vienna last night as the injury of first-round elimination by a superior Red Star Belgrade side was accompanied by insult to the midlands club's supporters, who came under attack from missiles outside the Gerhard Hanappi stadium and flares inside the arena from Yugoslav fans. </p> <p>Red Star face at least a fine by Uefa, which is bound to investigate after the Yugslav club's 8,000 fans, outnumbering Leicester's by four to one, fired a flare into the English section before kick-off as the rival supporters squared up to each other across wire fencing. Police restored order. </p> <p>After 22 minutes the Red Star fans celebrated their side's first goal by launching two more flares into the Leicester section and at least three on to the pitch, one narrowly missing the goalkeeper Tim Flowers. </p> <p>Despite the provocation, which had seen Leicester followers bombarded by bottles and other missiles outside the ground, Leicester's chairman John Elsom appealed over the PA system for his club's fans not to cause any trouble. </p> <p>There was no respite for Leicester's players either. Not only did Peter Taylor's team suffer their first defeat in nine games this season but Ade Akinbiyi and Andrew Impey were taunted with monkey chants by Red Star fans every time they touched the ball. </p> <p>Tempers were running high even before this second leg on neutral Austrian territory, with Red Star infuriated by Uefa's decision to take the match out of Belgrade. The fires were stoked further in Vienna when Red Star's coach Slavoljub Muslin, reigniting his verbal feud with Taylor at Filbert Street, insisted he would never shake hands with Leicester's manager. </p> <p>Yet, whatever Leicester's complaints about Red Star's behaviour, England's current second-best team could not question the superiority of their conquerors who, like Atletico Madrid three years ago, convincingly ended their Uefa Cup challenge at the first hurdle. </p> <p>Goran Drulic scored the first and last goals and laid on his side's second for Ivan Gvozdenovic, inspiring a victory which would have even more comprehensive but for several near-misses and Flowers's defiance in the second half. </p> <p>Leicester's hopes flickered only briefly after Muzzy Izzet equalised from Steve Guppy's cross shortly before the interval. In the second half Red Star's pace and movement constantly unhinged the normally reliable Leicester rearguard. </p> <p>The story might have been different had Darren Eadie not squandered two chances in five first-half minutes, first shooting wide from Izzet's flick and then failing with two headers from Guppy's centre, the first against a post, the second sending the rebound wide. </p> <p> <strong> Red Star Belgrade</strong> (3-5-2): Kocic; Markovic, Vitakic, Lalatovic; G Bunjevcevic, Gvozdenovic, Ilic (Bajcetic, 42min), Lerinc, Acimovic (Zoric, 82); Drulic, Pjanovic. </p> <p><strong> Leicester City</strong> (3-5-2): Flowers; Rowett, Elliott, Taggart; Impey, Savage, Lennon, Izzet, Guppy (Davidson, 78); Eadie (Cresswell, 57), Akinbiyi (Gunnlaugsson, 78). </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> P Rodomonti (Italy). </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "Defying a growing chorus of demands from inside and outside Yugoslavia to recognise election defeat last Sunday and step down, Slobodan Milosevic met his top party colleagues in Belgrade yesterday to launch his campaign for a second round of the presidential race. <p>The meeting was shown on television, a sure sign that he intended to tough out the wave of protest at the first round result. </p> <p>The 18-party Democratic Opposition of Serbia, which insists its candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, has already won the election, said it would move beyond street protests and mount \"a total blockade of the system and institutions\" to force Mr Milosevic to respect the popular will. </p> <p>\"We will call a general strike. We shall seek to paralyse all institutions, schools, theatres, cinemas, offices ... call everyone on to the streets and stay on the streets until he who wants to be president by force gives up his post,\" said Zoran Djindjic, Mr Kostunica's campaign manager. </p> <p>The opposition's claim to have won outright in the first round received strong backing from the Serbian Orthodox church and Vojislav Seselj, the ultra-rightwing leader of the Radical party, whose candidate came third in the first round. Describing Mr Kostunica, a 56-year-old Belgrade lawyer, as \"Yugoslavia's president-elect\", Patriarch Pavle said the holy synod urged him and \"all the people elected together with him, when they take over the control of the state, its parliament and its municipalities, to do so in a peaceful and dignified way\". </p> <p>Although the church has opposed Mr Milosevic before, its recognition of Mr Kostunica carries great moral weight for traditional Serbs. </p> <p>In another important signal, General Nebojsa Pavkovic, the army chief of staff, told state television that \"Milosevic would never order the army to intervene against its people\", and said the army was not taking sides in the crisis. His remarks appeared to be a retreat from earlier praise for Mr Milosevic and were probably a reaction to dissent among officers. </p> <p>Rumours that Russia might be willing to offer Mr Milosevic a safe haven for exile were sparked when a foreign policy official in Brussels suggested the issue had come up when the French foreign minister, Hubert V\u00e9drine, saw President Vladimir Putin yesterday in Moscow. The idea was also reportedly discussed when Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the German chancellor, saw Mr Putin on Monday. </p> <p>\"Milosevic and his family are seeking contact with the Russians and hoping to move to Moscow,\" the official said in Brussels. \"This could be one of the ways out.\" Mr Milosevic's half-brother, Borislav, is the Yugoslav ambassador in Moscow. Mr V\u00e9drine denied that any escape plan for Mr Milosevic had been discussed. </p> <p>The New York Times reported that western governments were passing the word to Mr Milosevic through intermediaries that he had a few days to renounce power and leave the country, but that if he delayed, he could face arrest and a trial in the Hague on war crimes charges. \"His choice is to fight or make a graceful exit,\" a western official said. \"His only hope of avoiding the Hague is to say, publicly and irrevocably, that he's leaving.\" </p> <p>No western country would publicly bless an arrangement like this, the officials told the New York Times, given Mr Milosevic's indictment by the war crimes tribunal. </p> <p>\"But there are enough people indicating, to the extent he's listening, that he has a little time to make a dignified exit without interference,\" another official said. \"We want him to hear it loud and clear.\" </p> <p>But with Mr Milosevic now signalling that he intends to resist the presure until at least October 8, when the second round of polling is due, the crisis in Yugoslavia was moving towards deadlock. </p> <p>Official backing for a run-off came when the federal election commission produced what it called the final vote count at an extraordinary late night meeting on Wednesday. They said Mr Kostunica had earned 48.96% of the vote to 38.62% for Mr Milosevic. </p> <p>The meeting was originally scheduled for 8pm but the chairman eventually appeared at about 11.30pm, carrying an unsigned sheet of A4 paper with data from the federal bureau of statistics. </p> <p>The 10 government-appointed representatives on the commission then voted to hold a run-off, as did Mr Milosevic's Socialist party.</p>",
  "The fate of the conjoined twins, Jodie and Mary, was sealed yesterday when their parents gave up the legal fight to prevent an operation which is bound to lead to the death of the weaker girl. <p>The couple decided they could do no more after two courts and four judges agreed that the procedure must go ahead, despite their fierce objections on religious grounds. </p> <p>The dramatic decision not to take the case to the House of Lords or to Europe clears the way for doctors to operate as soon as they believe the time is right. </p> <p>Surgeons initially indicated that they would like to separate the seven-week-old twins when they were three months old, but if the girls' condition suddenly deteriorates they could proceed at once. </p> <p>The parents, who are from the Maltese island of Gozo, are still fervently opposed to the operation but have promised not to try to flee Britain with their children. </p> <p>However, pro-life campaigners repeated an offer to arrange for the parents and children to be taken to a safe haven in Italy. They also criticised the official solicitor, who has been acting independently of the parents on Mary's behalf, for not fighting on. </p> <p>Yesterday's decision ends a legal battle which has involved complex legal, moral and religious issues and which has attracted worldwide attention and divided public opinion. </p> <p>The twins were born on August 8 at St Mary's hospital in Manchester. When it became clear that if the twins were separated Mary would die, the parents, who are Catholic, refused to give their permission for the operation, preferring to let nature - or God's will - take its course. If no operation takes place both twins are expected to perish within six months because Jodie's heart would not stand the extra pressure. </p> <p>Wanting to save Jodie, the doctors asked the high court to rule that the operation should go ahead. A judge backed them but the parents appealed. After an extraordinary hearing in which both the Catholic church and the ProLife Alliance argued that the parents' wishes should be respected, three senior judges sided with the doctors. </p> <p>It had been thought that the parents would continue their fight but yesterday afternoon their solicitor, John Kitchingman, announced that they felt they could do no more. </p> <p>He said: \"The parents - having taken this case to two courts and four judges, whose decisions were unanimous - feel that they have done all they can for both daughters and are unable to take this any further.\" </p> <p>Mr Kitchingman also appealed for the parents' privacy to be respected. However, it is known that they have received several six-figure offers to tell their story. One legal source close to the case said the parents would be \"foolish\" not to consider the offers. Even if the separation operation goes well, it is possible that Jodie could be disabled and need expensive care for the rest of her life. </p> <p>The unique nature of the case was brought out in an unusually lengthy statement from the official solicitor, Laurence Oates. </p> <p>He too had decided not to take the case further. He said he had taken into account not only the parents' stance but also the \"moral, ethical and legal arguments\" submitted by the Archbishop of Westminster and the ProLife Alliance during the appeal. </p> <p>Mr Oates repeated the judges' point that the ruling was \"specific\" to this case. He was satisfied that the decision would not \"undermine the law deriving from and supporting the respect to the sanctity of life and the belief that life has equal value\". </p> <p>Pro-life campaigners and the Catholic church are worried that the twins' case could enshrine in law the principle that it is permissible to carry out a wrong act in order to do right. </p> <p>Last night the ProLife Alliance said it believed the parents would be within their rights to take the children out of the country. But a spokesperson said: \"They may have lost the will to fight on.\" </p> <p>The appeal court case ended last Friday with the judges describing their agonising decision over whether or not the operation should go ahead. </p> <p>Senior judge Lord Justice Ward concluded: \"Mary has always been fated for early death. Though Mary has the right to life she has little right to be alive. She is alive only because, to put it bluntly but nonetheless accurately, she sucks the life blood of Jodie and her parasitic living will soon be the cause of Jodie ceasing to live. </p> <p>\"Jodie is entitled to protest that Mary is killing her. The best interests of the twins is to give the chance of life to the child whose actual bodily condition is capable of accepting the chance to her advantage even if that has to be at the cost of the sacrifice of a life. I am left in no doubt at all that the scales come down heavily in Jodie's favour.\" </p> <p>The children were born joined at the abdomen but doctors are confident that Jodie could have a full and healthy life - if given the chance to operate. They believe there is only a 5 per cent chance of Jodie dying if they could pick the time of the operation. If the operation had to be carried out in an emergency, however, this could rise to 64 per cent. Mary will inevitably die within minutes of any operation. </p> <p>The operation could be brought forward if Mary, who relies on her stronger sister for oxygenated blood, continues to grow - as she has been doing - apparently at the expense of her twin. It is thought that the operation could take a team of four surgeons and two anaesthetists up to 10 hours to complete.</p>",
  "The England number 10 shirt worn by Sir Geoff Hurst in the 1966 World Cup final made footballing history for a second time yesterday when it was sold for a record \u00a391,750 at auction. <p>A soccer-mad British collector was described as \"overjoyed\" with his acquisition which he bid for by telephone from his hotel room in Sydney where he is holidaying during the Olympic games. </p> <p>Christie's spokeswoman Jill Potterton said the die-hard Tottenham Hotspur fan who attended the 1966 final as a 12- year-old had stayed up until all hours to join in the bidding from all around the world. She added: \"He doesn't want to be named but he comes from west London and the shirt will now take pride of place in his private collection at home.\" </p> <p>The price was more than three times that expected by experts at Christie's, and more than double the previous record of \u00a344, 000 for one worn by the late Bobby Moore, Hurst's captain on the historic day. </p> <p>The successful bidder later told Christie's staff that he hoped the shirt would ultimately go on show at the foot ball museum in Preston once it is opened. </p> <p>West Ham, the club Sir Geoff played for at the time of the World Cup final in which he scored a hat-trick, was believed to be among the unsuccessful British bidders for the shirt. </p> <p>Another of the 129 lots put up by Sir Geoff, the blue cap awarded to him for the final stages of the World Cup triumph, fetched \u00a337,600. </p> <p>Before the auction, Sir Geoff said: \"It was always my intention to leave the collection to my children, but I have three daughters so how do you split it up fairly? They have selected some special items they want to keep and we have also kept some pieces for the grandchildren. </p> <p>\"But I have already lost a significant proportion of the collection in two burglaries, so it is all kept locked away now and no-one sees it. </p> <p>\"I am as patriotic as the next man and will cherish my footballing days but at this stage in my life I would like to have some control over the distribution of the collection.\" </p> <p>Other items up for sale included a nine carat gold FA Cup winner's medal from 1964 and items from Sir Geoff's West Ham days.</p>",
  "It was, of course, the happiest day of her life when the former Playmate of the Year picked her way daintily across a carpet of white rosebuds to the chapel where she committed her life to the Texan billionaire. <p>But there was an obvious price to be paid by Anna Nicole Smith, a 26-year-old full of life, breast implants and her favourite food - mashed potatoes and gravy - when she married her beau, the oil baron J Howard Marshall II, aged 89. </p> <p>Now a judge has put a figure on the one-time topless dancer's sacrifice: $449.7m (\u00a3300m), or $1.11m for each day of their union, a match rent asunder only by his death 14 months after they became man and wife. </p> <p>Smith says that he had promised her half his fortune, estimated at $1.6bn, if she would only give him her hand. E Pierce Marshall, the oilman's 60-year-old son, says she is a gold-digger. </p> <p>The old man, whose previous mistress was also, by coincidence, a topless dancer - she died during a facelift operation - left a will that omitted mention of the near-6ft blonde. </p> <p>Instead, the document left everything to a charity and E Pierce, who says his father was senile when he made the promise to his stepmother, the third Mrs J Howard Marshall II. </p> <p>Smith took her case to a bankruptcy court in Los Angeles, which ruled that E Pierce had deprived her of her due and awarded her the almost half-a-billion dollars plus punitive damages to be fixed later. She is supported by Marshall's eldest disinherited son, J Howard III. </p> <p><b> Wonderful</b><br> </p> <p> \"Oh my God, this is wonderful news,\" said Smith, now 32. \"He promised me half of everything because he loved me and he wanted to make me happy. He bought me just about anything I wanted. He loved to surprise me. No one ever took care of me in my whole life and this man did that and I loved him for it.\" </p> <p>And indeed Marshall did take care of her, as one might expect of the man who owned a chunk of Koch Industries Inc, the second-largest privately held corporation in the United States. </p> <p>Naturally there were houses and cars, the humdrum baubles of a smitten money-machine's five-year courtship of the woman who was a fried chicken restaurant waitress until she started making her way in the world. But there were highlights too: the $50,000 each month for out-of-pocket expenses, more than enough to take care of her $4,000-a-month food bill; the day he treated her to a trip to a jeweller's in New York and came away $2m lighter. </p> <p>People talked, of course they did. They talked of the nanny, the bodyguard, the driver, two actors and a director and their words reached the ears of E Pierce. \"Oh sure, he was trying to get surveillance put in my bedroom and my bathroom,\" said Smith. </p> <p>J Howard, though, would not be deflected from his course and finally the couple married at the White Dove wedding chapel, in Houston, in June 1994. As is the way with such ceremonies, tears were shed, not least by the bridegroom when Smith informed him that it would not be possible to spend the wedding night together due to a pressing modelling engagement. </p> <p>But, all agreed, at least she looked beautiful in her white wedding dress and modest veil. She was not to wear them again until his funeral the following summer. </p> <p>No sooner had the family divided the ashes than Smith went to pieces. The 1993 Playmate of the Year tried to fill the emptiness at the core of her life with Twinkies, Ho-Hos and Dream Pies, junk food sustenance that inflated a frame that had once been chosen to replace Claudia Schiffer as the Guess? jeans model into 200lb at the mercy of liposuction. </p> <p>But the complexity has not left Smith's life, with the Los Angeles court ruling that fraudulent handling of her late husband's estate by E Pierce left her penniless. Now she faces another hearing in Houston to determine the validity of Marshall's will and is understood to have taken acting classes and lost 50lb in pursuit of justice. </p> <p>Her attorney says that the outcome of the first case prepares the ground for victory in the second </p> <p>\"Does that change things? Oh, I think it does,\" said Philip Boesch. \"It's pretty powerful language and it's telling of the damages done to her.\" </p> <p>But her opponent, E Pierce, remained defiant. \"This extraordinary decision is a miscarriage of justice that is not supported by the facts and will not stand up on appeal,\" he said. \"We are confident that a Texas jury that is permitted to evaluate all of the evidence in the case will allow my father's clearly stated wishes to be carried out.\" </p> <p> <b> Relatives who fight for their rights</b></p> <p>\u0095 John Lennon's son, Julian, had to fight a protracted battle before he could claim any of his inheritance. His share of the former Beatle's \u00a3250m estate was put in trust until he reached 30. </p> <p>But Yoko Ono, Lennon's second wife, gained control of the estate in 1980 after her husband was shot dead outside their apartment in New York. She said she was told to pay Julian's inheritance only when he was mature enough. </p> <p>\"I don't want a legal war but if I have to, I will,\" the 32-year-old declared in 1994. \"I'm trying to talk things over with Yoko, I only hope it will be amicable. The cash isn't the issue, it's the principle. My father wanted me to be looked after when I reached 30 - but there has been nothing.\" </p> <p>Two years later, after wrangling between lawyers, Yoko Ono, then 63, issued her stepson with an ultimatum of \"growing up\" or not getting a penny. She subsequently agreed to pay Julian $20m (\u00a312m) on the grounds that he had finally matured. </p> <p>\u0095 The only daughter of the British artist Henry Moore took the foundation which controlled her father's works to court, claiming ownership of sculptures and drawings estimated to be worth up to \u00a3200m. </p> <p>Mary Danowski and her three children attempted to win title to the disputed works in 1993. The four would have inherited all his estate if the charitable foundation had not been set up. </p> <p>Mr Moore gave the charity his entire estate with the exception of his Hertfordshire home and his studios. After his death in 1986 a dispute arose over who owned the works. </p> <p>\u0095 Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza de Kaszon (Heini to his friends), the owner of a collection of 1,500 paintings, including several masterpieces, is at loggerheads with his eldest son, Georg Heinrich (Heini Jnr to friends). They are battling over control of the Thyssen Bornemisza group which produces industrial equipment and a profit of about \u00a360m a year. </p> <p>Baron Thyssen, who transferred the group to his son in 1983, began a lawsuit in Bermuda last year in which he claimed he was owed tens of millions of dollars by Heini Jnr as part of the handover deal. He bemoaned the greed of his boy, writing: \"I want you to know that it remains my intention that each of my children should obtain his or her proper share of my assets upon my death. At present, Heini Jnr has manoeuvred himself into a position where, in the absence of action on my part, he would get far too much, and I wish to correct this.\" </p> <p>With the art collection at stake, as well as nine houses across the world, not to mention the group itself, there is much to play for.</p>",
  "The government's defeat over pensions is a pointer to the central dilemma it will face if - as is still overwhelmingly likely - Labour wins the next general election. <p>Those in Brighton who applauded Barbara Castle's plea for a restoration of the link between the basic state pension and rising national earnings have public opinion on their side. But many voters who wish to see a rise in the state pension are opposed to any increase in taxation. Some will undoubtedly have supported the fuel protesters a couple of weeks ago. There is a basic contradiction in British attitudes to taxation and public spending. </p> <p>Whatever the size of its majority, the next Labour government will face two risks: the end of an economic boom fuelled by cheap energy and the continued rise of the politics of direct action. Each poses dilemmas for which the government seems ill prepared. Together they could propel it into a different world. </p> <p>It is too soon to know how sharp a shock high oil prices will inflict on the world economy. The developed world is less dependent on oil than it was at the time of the last oil shock 30 years ago. We are a good deal more energy- efficient. In real terms the price of oil is still low, and the release of strategic oil reserves in Europe and then the US may push it lower. So far, we are not facing a price hike of the sort that triggered recession in the 70s. </p> <p>Even so, the tripling of the oil price over the past two years should serve as a warning. The new economy is not that new. Business still depends crucially on energy inputs. A case can be made that the long boom in rich coun tries at the end of the 20th century was more a side effect of cheap oil than the result of new technologies. </p> <p>Moreover, the prospects of the world economy over the coming year depend crucially on the weather. A cold winter will increase fuel consumption and push up the oil price. In the US, where dependency on cheap energy is greatest and expectations of the new economy are most exaggerated, the shock could be severe - not least on Wall Street. There is a lesson here for anyone who still thinks that living standards in the richest countries can go on rising indefinitely, regardless of finite resources. </p> <p>There is also a challenge for the government. Mr Blair came to power on the back of two huge gifts of fortune - a Tory party more discredited and despised than it had been in living memory, and an ongoing economic boom. Neither of these circumstances can reasonably be expected to last forever. At present, though, a sharp change in the economic climate poses a greater risk to the government than the rather remote prospect of a sustained Tory revival. </p> <p> In an ironic reversal of fortune, the fuel protests and the defeat on pensions in Brighton have caught the government in a pincer. Its reputation now hangs on how successful it is in reconciling demands for higher public expenditure with the resistance of financial markets - and large numbers of voters - to higher taxes. In turn, this depends to a considerable extent on how it responds to the eruption of populist street politics. </p> <p>The leakage of political energy away from established parties is a familiar fact of the age, but its implications have gone largely unexplored. When political initiative shifts on to the streets, government loses its capacity to implement any clear strategy. If it responds by trying to second guess an increasingly fickle public it can lose all credibility. As the former Tory MP George Walden has noted in his incisive recent book, The New Elites, the end result of the politics of populism is that people come to view their leaders with contempt. During the past weeks, when for a time it plainly lost control of events, the government came perilously close to being seen in this way. </p> <p>One of the lessons of the past few weeks, is how easily and quickly a postmodern economy can be disrupted. In a matter of days, a loose, leaderless network of about 2,000 farmers and hauliers linked together by mobile phones was able to bring the country to the verge of standstill. It is hard to believe that this lesson will be forgotten - either by the people who carried off this coup, or by future protesters. The government will probably have to get used to direct action as a recurrent feature of politics. </p> <p>There is another, even more disturbing, lesson. Voters will not tolerate the levels of taxation required to provide the public services, environmental policies and pensions they insist they want. So far, the government has managed to straddle this contradiction. Boosted by a booming economy and a series of windfalls, tax revenues are buoyant. But with a further rise in the price of oil this could change very quickly. It will be infinitely more difficult to meet voters' conflicting demands when the economy is in recession. </p> <p>The government's dilemma has always been how to promote social-democratic values at a time when many traditional social-democratic policies have ceased to be effective. The contradictory public attitudes expressed in Brighton and at the petrol pumps suggest the next Labour government will face choices harder than any it has had to make so far. </p> <p> John Gray is professor of European thought at the LSE </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Tamoxifen, the drug used to treat breast cancer, looks set to lose its wonder status following the announcement that a new medicine out-performed it in trials on women with advanced tumours. <p>The announcement, at the European breast cancer conference in Brussels yesterday, will alarm the Department of Health because it has serious implications for the NHS drugs bill. </p> <p>Because tamoxifen has been around for a long time and is out of patent, it is cheap, at \u00a310 a month per patient. The new drug, letrozole, costs \u00a385 a month. If it receives a licence for first-line treatment of women with advanced breast cancer, as the manufacturers expect, it must inevitably be referred to the national institute for clinical excellence for a decision on cost effectiveness. Novartis claims that up to 20,000 breast cancer patients in Britain could benefit from the new drug. </p> <p>The trials, involving more than 900 post-menopausal women, compared letrozole with tamoxifen. All of them had tumours that were so large that breast conserving surgery was not considered possible by their doctors. The results showed that more women who took a course of the new drug were able to avoid having mastectomies - 45% compared with 35% on tamoxifen. </p> <p>Tamoxifen halts the progression of the disease for an average of six months. The trials showed that letrozole continued working for 9.4 months. Women on the new drug had a 30% lower risk of their cancer progressing than those on tamoxifen. </p> <p>One of the international experts who helped develop the drug, Stephen Johnston, consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden hospital in London, said: \"For us it is very exciting that the trials have shown such a clear and dramatic benefit and for the first time have substantial improvements in results over tamoxifen. </p> <p>\"It represents a real benefit because we can say to patients that there is a treatment that can control their cancer for longer.\" </p> <p>Paul Ellis, consultant clinical oncologist at Guy's, St Thomas' and Kings' Cancer Centre, said that the results were good news for women in Britain where breast cancer rates are among the highest in the world. </p> <p>\"These findings are likely to have a major impact on established treatment protocols,\" he said. </p> <p>A paper published today in the Lancet medical journal shows that the numbers of women given the wrong treatment in the US for early stage breast cancer has risen. Some were unnecessarily given mastectomies, but more were given breast conservation treatment when they needed radical surgery. </p> <p>Richard Sainsbury, from Huddersfield royal infirmary, said in a commentary article that British women with early stage breast cancer were still unnecessarily having a breast removed.</p>",
  "A woman with multiple sclerosis was yesterday cleared of a criminal charge of possessing cannabis, after telling a court that she needed it to relieve the symptoms of the muscle wasting disease. <p>The public gallery cheered as Lezley Gibson, 36, was found not guilty by a jury of seven women and five men at Carlisle crown court. She had denied one charge of possessing eight grams of the class B drug, worth \u00a340, on the grounds that she needed it for medical reasons. </p> <p>Outside court, flanked by her husband, Mark, Mrs Gibson said she would continue smoking cannabis and called for a change in the law: \"There are hundreds of people like me out there. No one in my position should have to be dragged through the courts like this, but I am glad it is all over. I feel brilliant.\" She intended to throw a party to celebrate. </p> <p>During the four day trial the jury heard that police raided her home in Alston, Cumbria, in August of last year and found cannabis. </p> <p>She told the court she began smoking 12 years ago, three years after being diagnosed with MS at 21. She had tried other medications and treatments, but nothing made her feel as well as cannabis. She smoked up to five joints a day bought from dealers, because it enabled her to have a more normal life: \"I would use paint stripper if I thought it would make me well.\" </p> <p>The prosecution did not accept Mrs Gibson had the defence of necessity, because she did not need to smoke cannabis to avoid death or serious injury from her condition.</p>",
  "The government is to postpone the date of the Queen's speech to the end of November to give controversial measures such as the freedom of information and the right to roam bills a chance to reach the statute book. <p>The failure to agree a date for the state opening of parliament is believed to have caused some anxiety at Buckingham Palace as the Queen has not been able to finalise her diary of engagements until it is settled. </p> <p>It is believed that a meeting of the government's business managers, in the House of Lords yesterday, agreed to put back the state opening of parliament rather than be forced to ditch any one of the promised bills because of a shortage of parliamentary time. </p> <p>The Queen's speech will contain the last batch of bills that Labour will put forward before the general election, which is expected next May. </p> <p>The decision to postpone the Queen's speech by at least two weeks will be greeted with huge relief, particularly by freedom of information campaigners who had feared that ministers' commitment to the bill would weaken in the face of problems in the House of Lords during the current overspill session. </p> <p>Ministers yesterday published the list of clauses and schedules for the committee stage of the freedom of information bill, which is expected to start in the middle of October. \"The government has been doing serious work on this bill. It is quite clear it is still strongly backed. It has not been dropped,\" said a House of Lords source. </p> <p>MPs are not due to return to Westminster until October 23 when they will elect a new speaker, but peers went back on Wednesday to start work on the outstanding number of bills that Labour hopes to get onto the statute book in this 'overspill session' before the next Queen's speech. </p> <p>Peers are already planning an all night sitting to deal with the countryside bill, which protects sites of scientific interest as well as introducing the right to roam. </p> <p>The Home Office confirmed yesterday that peers will have to work their way through swaths of amendments to the freedom of information bill before it has a chance to reach the statute book. </p> <p>The overspill session in the Lords will also see battles over the transport bill, which introduces congestion charges and privatises the national air traffic control system.</p>",
  "A brothel madam was ordered yesterday to hand over more than \u00a32m she had earned from three \"saunas\", where women smuggled from Thailand and eastern Europe entertained up to 1,500 men a week. <p>Josephine Daly, 64, was thought by Scotland Yard to be among the \"premier league of London madams\". She even advertised her saunas in police magazines. </p> <p>She was fined \u00a33,000, ordered to pay \u00a350,000 costs and served with a confiscation order for \u00a32m in assets at Harrow crown court, north-west London. </p> <p>Judge Barrington Black told Daly, who was brought into court in a wheelchair, that no one was suggesting that prostitution was illegal. \"What the law cannot accept is that others, be they men or women, should profit by such an act.\" </p> <p>He told Daly, who has no previous convictions, that in determining the right punishment he had taken into account matters including her ill health, although \"I have misgivings as to the full extent of your incapacity\". </p> <p>As well as her seven bedroom Victorian villa, named Bunty's Corner after a dog buried in the garden, Daly owns six other properties in London, including a dilapidated 60 room hotel and a hostel where the prostitutes lived. The properties have an estimated combined value of up to \u00a35m. </p> <p>Although she pleaded guilty to controlling prostitution between 1996 and 1997, police believe she built up her empire over more than 10 years. </p> <p>The court heard that her various premises had generated a \u00a33m income during 1996 and 1997. However, prosecutors have accepted that 30% of her sauna business was legitimate, and the amount to be confiscated was reduced by a third. </p> <p>Daly was wheeled from court past flowers and pot plants from well-wishers stacked against a wall. Messages included one from \"a customer\" which read: \"Keep smiling, the end is near.\" Another told her: \"I hope this small token of flowers shows that some of us support you,\" while a third said: \"After today I hope you have the strength to put it all behind you.\" </p> <p>Outside court, Daly said she would be \"cracking open a bottle of champagne. I was hoping for \u00a31m, which would have been easier to find, but I'll sort it... I don't want to go into prison; I don't think I would come out alive.\" </p> <p>She added: \"I am afraid I will have to retire now. I can't start again. I am too old. What a shame. Now if I was younger... But it has been an horrific three years, and it is a relief it is all over.\" </p> <p>Daly said that despite her guilty pleas and the judge's view that the evidence against her was <b> </b> overwhelming, she did not accept she had broken the law. She had admitted the offences only to spare her daughter, Emilia Tawaih - who was originally charged with her mother, but the prosecution dropped the case against her. </p> <p>\"I didn't know what the girls were getting up to,\" Daly claimed. \"I was never there because of my ill health. They did exactly what they liked.\" </p> <p>A police surveillance operation showed that 1,500 men a week were going to the Aqua Sauna, Lanacombe Sauna and the Ishka Bath. At one stage Daly ran a fourth sauna. </p> <p>Undercover officers paid a \u00a310 entrance fee and were invited to choose a women and a variety of sexual services. At that point they made an excuse and left. Real clients would be offered a drink and given a towel. </p> <p>Prostitutes got no salary but were allowed to keep whatever they earned. The receptionists delivered the door money to Daly's home in Crouch End, North London, each day. </p> <p>Outside court, Detective Inspector Paul Holmes said: \"She was a significant player in the London prostitution racket. It was highly organised.\"</p>",
  "Dozens of people were injured in rioting on the West Bank and in Jerusalem yesterday as the hawkish Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, staged a provocative visit to a Muslim shrine at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <p>Surrounded by hundreds of Israeli riot police, Mr Sharon and a handful of Likud politicians marched up to the Haram al-Sharif, the site of the gold Dome of the Rock that is the third holiest shrine in Islam. </p> <p>He came down 45 minutes later, leaving a trail of fury. Young Palestinians heaved chairs, stones, rubbish bins, and whatever missiles came to hand at the Israeli forces. Riot police retaliated with tear gas and rubber bullets, shooting one protester in the face. </p> <p>The symbolism of the visit to the Haram by Mr Sharon - reviled for his role in the 1982 massacre of Palestinians in a refugee camp in Lebanon - and its timing was unmistakable. \"This is a dangerous process conducted by Sharon against Islamic sacred places,\" Yasser Arafat told Palestinian television. </p> <p>Mr Sharon's second motive was less obvious: to steal the limelight from the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who returned from the US yesterday and could become a challenger for the Likud party leadership after Israel's attorney general decided not to prosecute him for corruption. </p> <p>But that ambition was overshadowed by the potential for serious violence at Haram al-Sharif, the point where history, religion and national aspiration converge. </p> <p>Palestinian protesters followed Mr Sharon down the mountain, chanting \"murderer\" and \"we will redeem the Haram with blood and fire\". They narrowly escaped clashing with Orthodox Jews who shouted \"go back to Mecca\". </p> <p>Although the Haram is part of Arab East Jerusalem, occupied illegally by Israel since 1967, Jews revere the esplanade, which they call the Temple Mount, as the site of a temple destroyed in AD70. </p> <p>The 35-acre site is the single biggest obstacle to peace and, as Mr Sharon asserted yesterday, an inalienable part of the Jewish state. </p> <p>\"The Temple Mount is in our hands and will remain in our hands. It is the holiest site in Judaism and it is the right of every Jew to visit the Temple Mount,\" he said after his descent. </p> <p>Palestinians and Israeli liberals denounced the visit as a dangerous provocation. \"The timing and the decision to visit the Haram was taken to flare up the area and to burn up the place,\" said a blood-splattered Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arabmember of the knesset, who suffered a broken wrist in the scuffles at the shrine. \"He wants to see more blood and more killing. He wants to kill the peace.\" </p> <p>The protests inside the Haram were extinguished, but not before two screaming riot policemen were rushed down the mountain on stretchers, and at least five Palestinians were injured. </p> <p>Later in the day, clashes broke out on the main commercial street in Arab East Jerusalem, and outside the West Bank town of Ramallah. </p> <p>Mr Sharon was unrepentant, claiming he had been on a mission of reconciliation. \"What provocation is there when Jews come to visit the place with a message of peace? I am sorry about the injured, but it is the right of Jews in Israel to visit the Temple Mount.\"</p>",
  "The head of the Yugoslav army steadied nerves in the capital yesterday, by publicly ruling out military intervention during the political crisis that is rocking Serbia. <p>Speaking in Belgrade, General Nebojsa Pavkovic, who is known to be close to President Slobodan Milosevic, said the president \"will never order the army to intervene against the people\". He added that the army would respect the choice of Yugoslavs in presidential elections. </p> <p>Gen Pavkovic, who is viewed as a highly political general, said the police existed to \"keep the peace [in case of riots]\" and that the army did not \"intervene in such cases; it has other duties\". </p> <p>When asked how he would react if he were ordered to intervene, Gen Pavkovic said: \"The army is completely outside of the political field and has never meddled in politics.\" </p> <p>Analysts said his statement was cleverly worded and some believed he was positioning himself for a Kostunica presidency. </p> <p>In a strong show of support for the opposition leader, the influential Serbian Orthodox church issued a statement calling on \"Vojislav Kostunica and all the people elected together with him, when they take over the control of the state, its parliament and its municipalities, to do so in a peaceful and dignified way\". The statement was addressed to \"Vojislav Kostunica, elected president of Yugoslavia\". </p> <p>Several politicians and backers of the regime have begun to lay the ground for a change in allegiance, but no one has yet formally left the ruling regime. There are unconfirmed reports of top figures whose resignations have been rejected. </p> <p>The federal finance minister, Milan Beko, who is also chairman of the Zastava Group, quit his job at the car factory. Zastava has reported big losses. He said the decision had nothing to do with Sunday's election but was because he no longer had local backing. The town of Kragujevac, where Zastava is based, voted massively for the opposition. </p> <p>\"I handed in my resignation on Monday, but it is not a political decision. Zastava should be managed by somebody who will enjoy support on every level, so that the company may prosper,\" he said. </p> <p>Boguljub Karic a businessman who for years was close to Mr Milosevic, is also shifting. The banker, who runs a mobile phone network and television station, dramatically changed his pro-Milosevic programming this week and broadcast instead reports from the opposition alliance's press conference. </p> <p>Slobodan Cerovic, the tourism minister, said the government should \"respect the decision of citizens at the ballot box\". Unconfirmed reports were circulating across the country that two top officials, Momir Bulatovic, the federal prime minister, and Ivica Dacic, the president of the Socialist party of Serbia's Belgrade board, had tendered resignations that were rejected. </p> <p>Mr Bulatovic appeared to be under massive pressure at a press conference on Monday. His Socialist People's party is the kingmaker between the Democratic Opposition of Serbia - which has the largest bloc of seats in both chambers of the federal parliament - and the regime coalition which has slightly fewer. </p> <p>With the balance of power in his hands he must chose between the regime that many view as a long term loser, or be seen as committing a massive act of political betrayal. </p> <p>Mr Dacic was the Socialist party spokesman before being moved to a position of responsibility for Belgrade. Their failure to win Belgrade is a major blow to the regime, particularly since the last four months of opposition administration have been tainted by widespread corruption. </p> <p>Unconfirmed reports said that Zeljko Mitrovic, head of Pink television, was prevented from making a statement supporting Mr Kostunica's victory. </p> <p>The extent of support for Mr Milosevic within the police remains unclear, but in the city of Kagujevac, a group of uniformed officers went into the offices of Otpor, the student-based resistance movement, asked for Otpor badges and stuck them on their uniforms, an Otpor spokesman, Slobodan Homen, said.</p>",
  "<p>It seems that Manchester United can hardly put a foot wrong these days - either on the pitch or in the boardroom. </p> <p>Football's Premier League champion, already the world's richest club, seems to have the Midas touch with every move it makes. Such is the intense interest in its exploits that any event, rumour or suggestion will have an immediate impact on the share price.</p> <p>Yesterday was no exception. On the strength of reports that the club was poised to sign a \u00a3300m sportswear deal with Nike, its stock price initially rocketed 10%, eventually settling down to end the day unchanged at 258p.</p> <p>The 15-year deal, rumoured to be announced along with full-year results on Monday, would earn the club \u00a320m per season.</p> <p>For those wanting to buy into the north-west's success story, now could be a wise time to reach for the cheque book. Although the price is certainly not at bargain levels, the feeling is that this stock is ready to climb. It is way off its 438p year high, although comfortably ahead of the low of 193p.</p> <p>With success on the pitch practically taken for granted - despite this week's stumble against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions' league - the financial support from the Old Trafford faithful will be maintained.</p> <p>The global following Manchester United attracts means the team has access to retail sales far in excess of rivals - a key factor in long-term growth.</p> <p>The downsides for United are, generally speaking, out of their control. One of the biggest threats, although not in the short term, is a shake-up of the transfer system being considered by Uefa, European football's governing body.</p> <p>This would hand far more power to the players which, it is feared, would lead to demands for the already sky-high wages to be pushed even higher.</p>",
  "There is an ambiguity at the heart of the government's attitude towards the Human Rights Act that has undermined preparation for its coming into force on Monday. Is it legal tidying up guaranteeing rights with which the population of the UK already broadly enjoy? Or does it herald profound change for public authorities: change that could land them in court if they fail to adapt? <p>Initially the government was complacent, thinking that the act would require little practical change. This attitude was responsible for the government's decision not to establish an independent, statutory human rights commission along with the act. Unless that decision is reversed, the act's benefits may not be realised and the costs could be great. </p> <p>If all the act did was bring Strasbourg rights into domestic law, it hardly needs a separate body to ensure its success. The existing equalities commissions - listed in the chart - were deemed necessary to promote and enforce legislation on race, gender and disability; the government was not convinced that was needed for human rights. </p> <p>Instead a task force was set up to advise on implementation. There was also a promise, that has not been kept, of a parliamentary committee to monitor the act. In the absence of an independent commission to provide guidance to the thousands of public, private and voluntary bodies required to comply with the act, Whitehall departments were instructed to send out any explanatory material deemed necessary. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the full implications of the act were becoming clearer as lawyers identified possible breaches of the European Convention of Human Rights in every area of public service, from education and health to planning and residential care. The Scottish executive found itself repeatedly challenged under Scotland's comparable, if more limited, human rights legislation, enacted as part of the devolution settlement. </p> <p>The Human Rights Act began to look less like a tidying up exercise than a revolution. The fact that only 3% of Scottish challenges succeeded was overlooked. Speculation in the press that the act would overturn life as we knew it drowned out the positive message that the home secretary was trying to get across. </p> <p>The rights protected by the act, Jack Straw points out, are rarely absolute; they can be limited to protect the rights of others. The central idea in the act is balance, not assertion. Moreover, the courts are there only as a backstop. Public bodies should prevent infringements by reviewing legislation, policy and practice to ensure they comply. </p> <p>But that means decisionmakers and those dealing with the public on a daily basis need to understand what the act requires: what infringement of privacy will be considered \"necessary and proportional\", how \"degrading\" treatment has to be before it is unlawful and what counts as a fair hearing. They need to know the implications of their responsibility to respect the rights to family life, freedom of religion and education. When exercising their discretion, everyone from the prime minister to care assistants will have to ask whether their own actions might infringe a basic right. </p> <p>That change, Mr Straw rightly says, will create a cultural shift in the delivery of public services, a new ethic and a \"fairness guarantee\". If it happens, the impact, particularly on vulnerable people, could be profound. Yet most ministers seem scarcely aware of the potential benefits to the public service for which they are responsible, nor of the potential costs of litigation if the service fails to adapt. </p> <p>As a result, the priority given to preparing for the act has been patchy and inadequate. The Department of Health's circular on it was not issued until July 20, leaving organisations only 10 weeks to prepare. In August, the immigration service was still trying to find an external agency to provide training for its 800 staff. Small voluntary organisations, such as Justice, which have stepped into the breach to provide training for public bodies on a daily basis, report having to turn down as many requests as they accept. The excellent, but small human rights unit in the Home Office could not hope to provide guidance on the scale that is needed. </p> <p>As the cases begin to roll, the need for a statutory body to bridge the gap will become pressing. This is already so in Scotland. With all-party support, the Edinburgh executive is now consulting on setting up a Scottish human rights commission. It could be like the existing Northern Ireland human rights commission established last year. Only in England and Wales, it seems, are there no plans to provide a similar service. The government task force said a commission would be needed if the act is to be implemented effectively. The commission for racial equality and the equal opportunities commission have given their \"wholehearted support\". </p> <p>A commission is needed, first and foremost, to advise, guide and cajole public bodies to adapt and comply. As a central and pro-active source of advice on cases and good practice it would drive the cultural change the Home Office wants to see. It could cut the number of complaints and, by encouraging mediation, the number of cases that reach court. It would monitor the impact of the act, advise the public and conduct inquiries where there is evidence of systemic abuse. A human rights commission would, in the words of the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, \"assist in creating a culture in which human rights are routinely observed without the need for continuous intervention by the courts\". </p> <p>The real challenge of the act is to bring human rights into the everyday language of public service, to foster a culture in which the public - pensioners and children, parents and offenders, patients and asylum seekers - are treated with fairness, dignity and respect. In the absence of a statutory body acting as an engine for change, it is unlikely to happen. </p> <p><b> Commissions of rights</b> </p> <p><b> Equal opportunities</b><br> Created 1976 to promote equal opportunites for men and women, end sex discrimination </p> <p><b> Racial equality</b><br> Created 1976 to tackle racial discrimination, promote racial equality </p> <p><b> Northern Ireland human rights </b><br> Created 1999 to ensure the human rights of everyone in Northern Ireland are \"fully and firmly protected in law, policy and practice\" </p> <p><b> Disability rights</b><br> Created 2000 to secure civil rights for all disabled people </p> <p> \u0095 Sarah Spencer is at the Institute for Public Policy Research </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Sasippr@aol.com\">Sasippr@aol.com</a></p>",
  "My husband and I are 75 years old. A year ago my husband was diagnosed as suffering from Lewy body dementia and I am still looking after a progressively confused and disabled husband. Once a week he is taken to a day centre. We cannot go on holiday, so in late October my husband is going into a residential home for two weeks, for the first time. <p>My dilemma concerns our two married sons, who are in their 30s. The older lived at home until he was 23, and the younger came to stay with us for more than a year when his first marriage broke up. I adore my five grandchildren, but am not very close to my daughters-in-law. </p> <p>Since I am not able to baby-sit or entertain as I used to, we see less and less of both families even though they live locally. They offer or give no help whatsoever. I am so bewildered and sad and unable to understand why. Should I expect more from my sons? </p> <p><b> Be clear and realistic</b></p> <p>You've not made it clear if you have yet spoken to your sons about your situation. It could be that if you have not explained matters to them directly, they are not aware of your concerns. It is too easy when one has a partner, children, a job and whatever else to be negligent towards one's aging parents. After all, mum and dad are the ones who over the years usually offer assistance rather than the other way around. </p> <p>In short, you are talking about the reversal of habitual relationship roles with your children, something which my ailing parents and I are learning to do only slowly. You also have to be clear as to what you mean by \"expect more\" from them. A general assertion that you don't get enough from them is not a good way to open up discussion. Better yet is to raise specific points as to what you need and want, and to be realistic as to what can be done by them in balancing their own lives with providing greater support to you. </p> <p>Whatever you do, avoid emotional blackmail in highlighting how much you did for them in the past. Believe me, they already know. And you have to involve their wives in discussion, too. Although you say you aren't close to them, what you will be asking from your sons affects them and you don't want to encourage what may seem like an apparent choice in responsibilities for them between their parents and wives. </p> <p>Finally, consider carefully what assistance you will be needing as time goes on which your sons may not be able or willing to provide, and start making arrangements as soon as possible. Outside of being a wise course of action, it also may make it easier for your sons to provide assistance without feeling like, whatever they do, it won't be enough. This may encourage them to be more forthcoming in offering what help and support they can. <br><b>Name and address withheld </b></p> <p><b> Spell out your feelings </b></p> <p>Unfortunately for mothers, it appears that it is the daughters-in-law who determine how involved sons can be with their parents. My husband is only in contact with his mother because I maintain our relationship with her through phone calls and occasional visits. I am ashamed of his lack of interest in her and have said this to them both. She cries while he shrugs and glares at me. </p> <p>My mum always says, \"Children don't ask to be born. You don't have children to look after you in your old age.\" I agree, although her response is the result of psychological pressure from her mother, aged 95, who she and my father, in their 70s, care for full-time. The only help my brother and I can offer is to listen to their difficulties, with very occasional granny-sitting. I wish I could do more but know that my parents appreciate our interest and this makes them feel a little better. Feelings are the key here. </p> <p>No one should feel badly about expressing their needs. You obviously have had a good relationship with both sons. Invite them round together, without their wives. Show them your letter, and this reply if it helps. Tell them how much their involvement in your lives means to you because you love them. Spell out your feelings as objectively as possible. Ask how they feel they can help: possibly little more than phone calls and flying visits. </p> <p>The important thing is to communicate. Generally, men seem unable or unwilling to deal spontaneously and supportively with emotional needs. You've met their needs before so now ask for help in meeting some of yours, or you will feel more and more angry and alone, and will be unable to care for yourself and your husband effectively. <br><b>Name and address withheld </b> </p> <p><b> Tell them you're upset</b></p> <p>My mother died 11 years ago (I'm 33 with two sisters), but it has only been in the past three or four years that I have really helped my father. I looked after my mother when she died but I didn't deal with my grief for years. </p> <p>Looking back, I can see that I was unable to accept my father's lonely and increasingly elderly situation. I will always feel ashamed that I did not do more for him in the first few difficult years. I think that your sons are grieving in a way (as I expect you are) for the father they have lost, for your youth and for their youth. I imagine they are also scared of this new situation. </p> <p>You should expect more - but you may have to ask. I wish my father had asked me for help - it might have jolted me into action sooner. You might need to find different ways to be together, where you can help each other (they could all come round for tea or perhaps it's their turn to \"parent-sit\"). </p> <p>My experience is that my relationship with my father has been strengthened, and my worries about the responsibility or time that a more caring role would carry have been unfounded. Can you talk together about this huge change in all your lives? </p> <p>Tell your sons how sad you are that you don't see them often. I value my father's changed role in my life and have found real pleasure in being able to help him - this was unexpected. <br><b>Name and address withheld </b> </p> <p><b> Be fun and have a party</b></p> <p>I became a care assistant when I was 59 and have just retired at 65. I learned a lot about people's attitudes towards their parents in that time. Some never visit, some visit every six months, others call in on a daily or weekly basis. A lot is to do with the relationship the parent had with the family originally. </p> <p>My advice? Throw a party, ring your daughters-in-law and ask them to help organise and decorate. If you can afford it, take a room at a local pub which does catering, and hire a disco. Phone members of your family you haven't contacted for years; nieces, nephews, brothers, sisters and friends; invite the grandchildren and any other kids. </p> <p>Have a party they'll remember. You read the Guardian so you can't be an old fogey, but perhaps you've given up being fun. Don't be negative and think of reasons you can't do it, and don't say it's impossible because of your husband. I'm sure if he were able, he'd tell you to go on living your life. Never be too proud to ask for help. <br><b>Joe Phillips, <br></b>Notts</p> <p><b>Next week</b></p> <p><b>I came from a hitherto close and loving family.

  "<p>From John Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy to Danny Boyle's Trainspotting, film directors have laboured under two basic misconceptions about the nightclub: (a) that they are remotely glamorous and (b) that they deserve accurate representation on the big screen. </p> <p>Strange as it may seem, the first rule of filming a nightclub scene is to make it as wholly inaccurate as possible. Real nightclubs are large Asda-style sheds, packed with blotchy, incoherent teenagers falling into one another. Who, save a few Harmony Korine fans, is going to want to watch that? </p> <p>Because nightclub scenes in films long ago surrendered any notion of reality, they've formed a parallel universe of their own, where LA punks burn oil drums in warehouses, jazz bars drip girls from every furnishing, and raves are crammed with beautiful fashionistas, punching the air to a cameo from Judge Jules. From Casablanca to The Matrix, nightclub scenes have come to form a body of work in their own right - one which refers back to its own lineage rather than anything approximating reality, and can be enjoyed for the ludicrous fantasy world it is. </p> <p>The Citizen Kane of club scenes is Basic Instinct, in which Michael Douglas, playing an Andrew Neil-lookalike in V-neck jumper and no shirt (a sweaty fashion detail signifying middle-aged man smelling out sex) watches Sharon Stone, who taunts his manhood by indulging in a faux-lesbian sex dance. </p> <p>The sequence is tragic in about 57 specific ways yet it comes across as one of the most enjoyable club scenes of all time. It captures the dripping seediness and sexual frisson of a cheap venue like few other movies, and is truer to the cold, calculating desperation of the solitary punter than the raft-full of arm-waving rave movies. </p> <p>Basic Instinct is true to the spirit of clubs, rather than hung-up on details of cool. In this respect, its effect - even more so than the out-and-out spoof, Austin Powers - is less ridiculous than a serious stab at 70s v\u00e9rit\u00e9 like 54 or Velvet Goldmine, both of which came across as bad school plays. When Powers enters a club, he quotes from Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls: \"This is my scene and it's freaking me out.\" A homage to an era of groovy film-making that spoofed itself to begin with. </p> <p>Like Austin Powers, Larry Clark's Kids acknowledged its cinematic lineage by retelling the Saturday Night Fever story 20 years on. In Clark's New York, nothing has changed - the club scene is still dominated by the snobbery and racism of \"Bridge and Tunnel\" (the derogatory term used for kids from Brooklyn and Queens who must travel over bridge and down tunnel to reach the forbidding red ropes of Manhattan's glittering clubs). </p> <p>British rave films took the notion of the peripheral nightclub scene and made it the whole reason for the movie. Instead of the timeless naff of Basic Instinct, the Po-Mo kitsch of Austin Powers or the muffled punches of Mean Streets, rave films tried to be down wit' da kidz. </p> <p>Rave films are essentially the same as 50s monster B-movies, selling themselves as \"Most Realistic Scenes Yet Seen!!!\" Attempting to portray a club as chemical assault has proved, however, as futile as attempting to make a rubber monster scarier by issuing the audience with a pair of 3-D specs. </p> <p>Jason Donovan's comeback film, Sorted, is unintentionally as camp as Austin Powers. But while it's easy to laugh at the casting, Donovan is undoubtedly the Dennis Hopper of rave - with a permanent 1,000-yard stare induced by over-exposure to Joseph's multi-coloured dreamcoat no doubt. Rave films have turned into our latest form of costume drama, trading on the club scene in the same way that the English tourist board trade on Jane Austen. Sorted is a fine addition to this body of work, and as such will surely be savoured on video for years to come. <br></p> <p><strong> The frat party </strong><br></p> <p><strong>Typical scene: </strong> Young Tom Cruise organises an impromptu brothel in the middle of high school frat party.

  "<p>Not many people look at the recent rise in car-leasing or fusion music and see a threat to civilisation, but Jeremy Rifkin does. Then again, he also believes that the 21st century - this apparently booming era - will witness the decline and fall of market-based capitalism. </p> <p>These are the sort of jeremiads normally voiced by shaggy, wild-eyed men touting hand-painted omens of doom. But Rifkin, America's best-known techno-sceptic, is speaking from the very heart of the capitalist system. </p> <p>He does not look like a seer. He is a bald middle-aged man in a suit and tie. The only remaining hint of his days as a Vietnam-era peace activist is a greying moustache. Rifkin is now a fellow at Wharton, the most prestigious business school in the US, probably the world - a temple, bar none, to the power of market forces. And he spends much of his working life counselling the chief executives of corporate America. </p> <p>Yet the 55-year-old academic and professional visionary has emerged as a lonely voice on the US intellectual stage, cautioning the west against its eager embrace of bio-technology. His single-minded struggle against powerful biotech giants such as Monsanto has made him some powerful enemies, and he has been dismissed as a publicity-conscious Luddite. But many of his early warnings now appear prophetic. </p> <p>He campaigned successfully for better hygiene laws governing the handling of meat and poultry in the US, long before food safety became a international front-page issue. And 13 years ago, he raised the alarm over an obscure decision by the US patent office to grant corporate proprietary rights over certain human genes, paving the way for the current ethical dilemmas swirling around the biotech industry. He has appeared regularly before Congress, and flew to France last year to bolster the French government's resistance to the import of genetically modified (GM) foods. </p> <p>Now Rifkin is raising a new spectre. His latest book, The Age of Access, (published in Britain this week), examines current trends in the way we live and do business, and extrapolates from them into the future. He comes up with some surprising conclusions. </p> <p>This is Rifkin's theory: With the spread of the internet and e-commerce, markets and lifestyles in the western world are accelerating to such an extent that they are triggering a fundamental change in our economic system. The ownership of physical property, which was once the bulwark of capitalism has become a burden to businesses and individuals alike, a liability rather than an asset. </p> <p>Consumers increasingly prefer to lease rather than buy big items such as cars, so they can continually upgrade them and avoid the pitfalls and responsibilities of ownership. </p> <p>Businesses meanwhile are finding there is less and less of a profit margin in selling things. Rather than a one-off transaction lasting minutes or seconds, they want to establish a life-long relationship with you, providing the car (or the lawnmower, the computer, the telephone or even the house) on a lease basis as an introductory transaction in a long stream of related goods and services. </p> <p>\"Ford would rather never sell you a car again,\" Rifkin argues. \"It would rather put you in its network, so that you continually buy the experience of driving rather than buying the vehicle. And the proof is in the pudding. The renewal rate on leasing is 54%. The renewal rate in market-based transactions is 25%.\" </p> <p>Eighty per cent of US companies are now leasing some or all equipment rather than investing in ownership. Whereas old-style companies, such as General Motors, owned a lot of solid assets, the new industrial icons, such as Nike, own hardly anything in physical terms, yet Nike is priced much higher on the New York stock exchange. Its production is \"outsourced\" - carried out by \"partners\" in the developing world. Rifkin describes it as a \"virtual company\". Its assets are almost entirely cerebral - it is selling a concept and a lifestyle, and in this new economy those are valued far above factories and headquarters. </p> <p>In capitalist markets, buyers and sellers come together to exchange property, but in this new system ownership does not change hands. Instead, users pay for access to experiences from suppliers. In place of markets, there are networks - arrays of companies supplying any experience you could wish for and supplying access to it in the form of subscriptions, leases, or membership schemes. </p> <p>From his suite of offices in downtown Washington, the prophet of the Age of Access is forecasting nothingless than the demise of the market as we know it </p> <p>\"What I'm suggesting in this book is eventually the nature of this technological revolution is leading us into an era where, by the mid part of the 21st century, market capitalism will have virtually disappeared,\" Rifkin argued in an interview. \"It will be there, but it will be only an appendage to a new network-based economy with access relations replacing property relations.\" </p> <p>The problem with this brave new world is that with all this packaging of lifestyles and experiences, pretty soon every part of our daily existence, once rooted in family or community, becomes a commodity that is sold back to us. </p> <p>Imagine, Rifkin says: \"You find virtually every activity you engage inside the family and outside the family is a paid-for commercial activity. We are commodified. We're moving from commodifying goods and services to comodifying culture.\" </p> <p>This is where the \"fusion\" music comes in. Just as the multinational giants of the 19th and 20th centuries scoured the planet for mineral wealth and cash crops, today's mega-corporations - AOL-Time Warner, Disney and the like - go searching for culture to mine and turn into easily digestible experiences for their users to access. Thus \"ethnic\" music from around the world is sampled and fused with rock and pop and turned into \"fusion\", making it accessible while tearing it from the roots from its culture. </p> <p>\"One of the messages here is that it's just as possible to deplete cultural diversity as it is biological diversity and physical resources. When you take a culture and homogenise it, transform it, package it and sell it back to people as a paid-for experience, then it is just as possible to deplete cultural diversity as biodiversity,\" Rifkin argues. \"And when you lose a culture to extinction it's just as final, you cannot get it back.\" </p> <p>In the cultural vacuum which results, fundamentalism blooms. In Rifkin's view, Blair and his fellow travellers along the third way have failed to see the threat because of their materialist outlook on life. </p> <p>\"Third way politics thinks that if you can build a healthy economy which is compassionate, you'll build a healthy society. My position in this book is that they are wrong from the get-go, because commerce never precedes culture, culture always precedes commerce.\" </p> <p>Rifkin's remedy is to pay more attention to fostering culture, particularly local culture, by promoting community-based education in an attempt to provide children with a deeper understanding of the world than computer screens alone can provide. </p> <p>The arguments are taut and provocative, but are they sane? Is our way of life really under threat because we decide to lease rather than buy. The book has received some harsh criticism at the hands of US journalists, who portray Rifkin as an overblown Cassandra, predicting the end of the world as we know it at every half-opportunity. </p> <p>His last book but one was called The End of Work, in which Rifkin, in characteristic apocalyptic style, predicted that manufacturing would become \"near-workerless\" in the near future, with the explosive growth in automation. Since the book was published in 1995, however, US unemployment has fallen significantly. </p> <p>Rifkin insists he did not get it wrong. In a somewhat defensive revised introduction to The End of Work, he points out that the US labour department has massaged the figures, that 2% of the adult male workforce is currently in prison and that the US has been able to keep its boom going artificially through the use of cheap credit. </p> <p>He has also come under fire from the left for focusing on the dilemmas of the wealthy world, for talking about the Age of Access when, as Rifkin himself points out, 62% of the world's population have never even made a telephone call. Rifkin points out, however, that he is simply examining the markets which matter to big business. Would it have been wrong to study the first stirrings of the industrial revolution in the English Midlands because it was not a worldwide phenomenon? </p> <p>Rifkin does seem to ignore or at least play down trends which con flict with his central theory - like the growth in ownership of homes and securities among the burgeoning middle classes. In some ways the desire to own is clearly deepening rather than eroding. </p> <p>However, he is pointing to significant changes in the way our economic system operates. </p> <p>A quick glance at prices on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq index will demonstrate the increasing importance of intangible, cerebral assets over physical capital. When Steven Spielberg's company, DreamWorks SKG opened for business it owned practically nothing other than the talent of its founders but its stock was valued instantly at $2bn. </p> <p>Meanwhile on the land, US farmers are no longer buying seeds but effectively leasing them from \"life-science\" companies which own the patent on the crops' very DNA. Once the first harvest is in, the farmers have no ownership rights over the seeds, which remain the intellectual property of the biotech firm and its commercial network which will typically supply the farmers with pesticide, weedkiller and fertiliser. It is arguably the most radical change to hit agriculture since the stone age. </p> <p>With the use of patents, commercial networks in Rifkin's Age of Access can potentially exercise far more control than old-fashioned monopolies in the age of production, and the current anti-trust laws - drawn up in a bygone era - are ill-equipped to regulate them. </p> <p>In the end the threat of that scale of economic dominance - wielded by biotech companies such as Monsanto, or entertainment conglomerates like AOL-Time Warner - may turn out to be far more potent than Rifkin's warnings about vehicle-leasing and \"fusion\" music. </p> <p>You can order a copy of The Age of Access by Jeremy Rifkin (Penguin, \u00a320) at the discounted price of \u00a317 plus 99p p&amp;p by calling the Guardian Culture Shop on 0800 316 6102.</p>",
  "<p> From somewhere on a spectrum between Kes and How Green Was My Valley, the British stage director Stephen Daldry brings us Billy Elliot, his screen debut. This is a bold, attractive and emotionally generous film about a young boy growing up in the north-east during the miners' strike of 1984-85, who discovers in himself a talent for dance. And - to the horror of his striking miner father, played by the perennially excellent Gary Lewis - this is not even the virile and masculine dance of Gene Kelly. It is ballet: mincing, prancing, flouncing tutu-wearing ballet, and young Billy (Jamie Bell) has to work on his pli\u00e9s along with all the girlies in a church hall where Dad sends him every week with his 50p sub in his hot little hand on the understanding that he is learning how to box. </p> <p>This is a film with a lot of charm, a lot of humour and a lot of heart. Daldry's direction and the screenplay by Lee Hall (who wrote the radio drama hit Spoonface Steinberg) distinguish themselves further in the discreet, intelligent way they deal with the question of Billy's nascent sexuality, avoiding vulgarity and prurience. The young male ballet dancer is not a stereotype, and yet the film certainly does not feel it necessary to reassure the audience that Billy is straight; for my money, that's part of this picture's liberal humanity. </p> <p>Billy finds himself in his embarrassing predicament when he is perpetually having the living daylights knocked out of him in the ring, unhappily wearing the seedy old boxing gloves that were once the property of his grandfather. Something in him responds to the sight of the ballet class in the opposite corner. He joins in, coming under the wing of the teacher, Mrs Wilkinson, played by Julie Walters, who in some ways is playing a version of the Michael Caine role in Educating Rita. She sees that dance, with its soaring language of the human spirit, might be Billy's ticket out of here. </p> <p>In Billy Elliot, dance is at once an expression of yearning, and a symptom of frustration; Mrs Wilkinson is described as \"unfulfilled - that's why she does dancing!\" Julie Walters could so easily have given an over-egged and gamey performance as the gutsy mentor, and it is a measure of her intelligence as a performer and Daldry's assurance as a director, that her approach is kept within bounds. There is a very good sequence where she and Billy do a dance routine that she has devised for him to I Love to Boogie by T Rex: and this scene nicely complements a later moment where Billy does his own dance of rage in the street when his Dad forbids him to dance again. </p> <p>It is a spontaneous choreography of frustration, which hovers between the world of realistic drama and the stylised world of the musical. But the action of Billy Elliot deepens as his father, at first infuriated, comes to accept his son's talent, and that some money must be found to enable him to audition for the Royal Ballet School. With a terrible clarity, it dawns on him that this means breaking the strike, and joining the cowering blacklegs who are bussed in through the picket lines every morning. </p> <p>So from questioning his ballet-loving son's masculinity, Billy's dad arrives at his own male crisis. The use of the strike is very studied: the period of Billy's first timid dance steps to his fateful audition covers the strike period almost exactly. By casting this momentous and traumatic event in British history as a backdrop to a young boy's growing pains, Daldry is, arguably, open to the charge of sentimentalising intractable political issues - and from a feminist perspective, there is not much to cheer about in the story of a boy who turns out to be much better than all the girls, and entirely monopolises his teacher's attention. </p> <p>Occasionally, the background furniture is pedantic, and a little baffling. Along with T Rex, we have a Ker-Plunk under Billy's bed and the inevitable Spacehopper - all shorthand for the 70s, rather than the 80s. But the incidental details are sketched in with flair and wit: there's a nice moment when Mrs Wilkinson's daughter Debbie is sauntering with Billy down the street and idly bangs a stick along the row of policemen's perspex riot shields, like railings. It couldn't happen in real life - but it's such a funny and surreal moment, of a piece with Daldry's amiable and buoyant direction. Billy Elliot has a freshness that makes it a pleasure to watch; it's a very emphatic success.</p>"
