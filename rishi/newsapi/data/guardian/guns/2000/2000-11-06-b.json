[
  "<p>On the afternoon of Saturday October 13 1945, next to each other in the directors' box at Stamford Bridge, sat the statesmanlike secretary of the Football Association, Stanley Rous, and Comrade Ravenko, the Soviet sports minister's chief emissary, newly flown in from Moscow. They watched Chelsea play West Ham United, and for much of the match the two men (plus two interpreters) were deep in whispered conversation. </p> <p>Only six months had passed since the death of Hitler, five since VE Day, four since the atom bombing of Hiroshima, and three since Clement Attlee's landslide victory over Winston Churchill in the general election. After the match, in the directors' room, Rous and Ravenko shook hands on their deal before chauffeurs drove them separately away through the bombed-out streets of west London. </p> <p>Three weeks later, on Sunday November 4, an aircraft touched down at Croydon airport, a US-built lend-lease Dakota with a scarlet star motif on the tailfin and each wingtip. Rous of the FA and a bemedalled phalanx of uniformed personnel from the Soviet embassy greeted the disembarking passengers in the hut which served as the arrivals' lounge. </p> <p>They comprised 39 men - 20 footballers and 19 trainers, coaches, journalists or general \"minders\" - and one woman, the interpreter Alex Elliseyeva, whom, in no time, Fleet Street was to dub \"Alexandra the Silent\". </p> <p>It was the Moscow Dynamo football team and through that month, 55 Novembers ago, they were to cause a luminous sensation in grey, austere, war-ravaged Britain. </p> <p>Rous at once had to apologise. He said he had personally telephoned more than 100 London hotels and none could (or would) put up the exotic party en bloc. So their first night was spent bleakly at the Coldstream Guards' Wellington barracks in St James's. They threatened to go home. The next night the party was dispersed in twos or threes around any number of dingy west London hotels. Double the complaints. </p> <p>On the third day, a desperate Rous persuaded the Imperial Hotel in Russell Square to lease him whole floor - \"Do Russians need sheets?\" the manager asked him - but accommodation only. All meals (including breakfast) thereafter were taken at the Soviet Embassy in Kensington. </p> <p>First opponents would be Chelsea on Tuesday November 13. At once, for a whopping \u00a314,000, Chelsea signed the demon Everton and England centre-forward Tommy Lawton, which news doubled the frenzy of anticipation in the capital. Five-shilling tickets (25p today) were already being offered by London spivs for more than \u00a35, which was then the average weekly wage. </p> <p>The Russians said the press could only watch them practise by invitation. Having done so, Fleet Street's finest were dismissively unimpressed. Paul Irwin in the Sunday Express found the Dynamo players \"completely ordinary ... all their work is done standing still. Do not expect much from this bunch of factory workers, Tommy [Lawton] will bag a hatful.\" </p> <p>In the People, Tom Morgan concurred: \"Chelsea will easily uphold the football supremacy of its fatherland with a ringing victory. Dynamos? These pale boys are far too slow for the top drawer.\" </p> <p>Harold Palmer in the Evening Standard predicted that \"Chelsea will sweep them off their feet\", although Stanley Walton in the Sunday Dispatch did warn: \"They all have slightly in-turning toes which, in my youthful days in Scotland, was the hallmark of a useful shot.\" </p> <p>By Tuesday at noon, west London was at a standstill. An hour before the start, the Stamford Bridge gates were closed on an over-capacity crowd of 74,496, but with thousands more breaking through smashed-down gates, it was reckoned next day that the actual attendance was more than 100,000. </p> <p>The Dynamo players warmed up for 15 minutes before kick-off - to the mesmerised delight of the throng that spilled over the greyhound track and right up to the touchlines. No English team had ever \"warmed up\". The Russians then took off their heavy serge \"sweatsuits\" (something else a British crowd had never seen) and to a collective gasp the Dynamo \"strip\" was revealed - dark blue shirts decorated with a pink letter \"D\" at the breast, long powder blue shorts hemmed with white, and emerald-green stockings with white turnovers. </p> <p>Immediately before kick-off, each Russian presented a bouquet of flowers to his opponent. The Chelsea players did not know where to look; the vast crowd fell silent at such a uniquely titillating wonder on an English football field. And it remained dumbfounded once the contest began as the Russians' inch-perfect passes, positional switches and fluent speed made monkeys of the back-pedalling English players. The chivalrous Lawton said afterwards: \"It was brilliant teamwork, speed and ball control. To be honest, the Russians should have been four goals ahead after only 20 minutes except for their poor shooting.\" </p> <p>It ended 3-3. The following Saturday, Dynamo annihilated Cardiff City by 10-0 at Ninian Park (40,000) - \"This is an awesome, greased machine, not a football team,\" said the Cardiff manager Cyril Spiers. On Wednesday, Dynamo beat Arsenal (who had hastily recruited Stanley Matthews) by 4-3 in obliterating fog at Highbury (54,600), and a week later drew 2-2 with Rangers at Ibrox (90,000). </p> <p>They returned to London for shopping, a banquet with the Lord Mayor, and a visit to Karl Marx's grave at Highgate - and left, in a scarlet-starred Dakota from Northolt airport, as surreptitiously as they had come, leaving a bereft Aston Villa with 70,000 printed but unused tickets for a farewell match the Birmingham club mistakenly thought it had arranged. </p> <p>On Sunday December 2, in his column in the Graphic, Stanley Matthews wrote of \"the finest team ever to visit these islands - we have certainly learned a thing or two from these Dynamos\". </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Internet pornographers face hasher sentences, a judge said today as he jailed one for 30 months.</p> <p>Judge Stephen Robins said that longer prison sentences might be needed to wipe out the \"channels to depravity\" that were now available, London's Southwark crown court was told.</p> <p>He told Stephane Perrin, a 29-year-old French national from Hove, East Sussex, that the sentence he would have to serve was just six months short of the maximum the law currently provided for this type of offence. </p> <p>But he said that the tariff was set before internet porn became a serious issue and \"that things have moved on\". </p> <p>Judge Robins said that documents found in his home showed the profits from the online porn business were substantial and may be far greater than courts have had to deal with up until now. </p> <p>\"This may be one of the early cases where the court has to determine the appropriate tariff of sentence for internet porn ... it may be that the court of appeal may see fit to give further guidance to sentences for internet porn,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But in the meantime the message must go out that those responsible for the publication of internet porn can expect to be dealt with severely by the courts in this country,\" he added. </p> <p>Perrin's operation came to light after a detective found the site, hosted in US, while surfing the internet in October last year. </p> <p>When his home was searched, documents were recovered revealing the identity and addresses of hundreds of customers from \"all corners of the world\", said Gareth Patterson, prosecuting. </p> <p>Detectives also travelled to the US as part of their investigation. Outside court, case officer Constable Jim Pearce said: \"Although this site was hosted in the United States, operators need not think they are safe because we have the power to go there, serve subpoenas on the web hosts and seize their records for use in proceedings in this country.\" </p> <p>Police financial investigator Detective Constable Gerry Panter said that, while he was happy with the sentence, it was \"unfortunate\" that as the law currently stood Perrin could keep the \u00a326,000 he had made from his operation. </p> <p>\"We need a minimum of two convictions before this money could be confiscated,\" he explained. </p> <p>However, while Perrin's internet operation is still running and making him money, it will be some time before he can enjoy any of it.</p> <p><br><strong>Useful links</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.oneworld.org/index_oc/\">Index on Censorship</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.eff.org/blueribbon.html\">Blue Ribbon Campaign for free speech online</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.netnanny.com/\">Net Nanny</a> <br><a href=\"http://freespace.virgin.net/neil.jones2/researchsite/netlaw.htm\">The Law and the Internet</a></p>",
  "<p>In recent years, both the British and US economies have grown at a rate far exceeding what was regarded as their rate of growth of productive potential, but with minimal inflation. </p> <p>How is that possible, and can it last? </p> <p>On an orthodox view of the world, such a happy combination of circumstances is not possible because the growth of productive potential is taken as rigid, as if given by God, and inflation is assumed to result from actual output growth in excess of potential output growth. </p> <p>The growth of productive potential is often referred to by economists as the natural rate of growth. The term was coined by the Oxford economist Sir Roy Harrod. </p> <p>What has become apparent from the experience of the last few years, however, particularly in the US, is that there is nothing natural about the natural rate of growth (just as there is nothing natural about the natural rate of unemployment), and that the underlying growth rate of an economy is very responsive to the pressure of demand (or actual output growth). </p> <p>If wage inflation is moderate as the economy expands and unemployment falls, it is possible to sustain high growth rates for long periods without inflation. This is basically because demand creates its own supply and there is no pressure on costs. </p> <p>There are a number of ways in which the growth potential of an economy responds to demand. First, the labour force is extremely elastic. The unemployed are drawn into work, participation rates rise, hours worked increase, part-timers work longer, and countries often draw on migrant labour. </p> <p>Secondly, the growth of labour productivity responds to the growth of output itself. Growth encourages capital accumulation which embodies technical progress; higher output brings scale economies, and the higher the level of output the more adept workers become (learning by doing). </p> <p>Miguel Leon Ledesma and I show in a forthcoming paper* that in all OECD countries in the past 35 years, the underlying growth of economies has expanded by roughly 60% of the increase in the actual growth of output, and by more in countries with higher labour reserves such as Greece and Italy. </p> <p>Two major factors constrain output growth and therefore put a brake on the real growth of living standards; one is inflation and the other is the balance of payments. </p> <p>The conventional wisdom in the US and Britain used to be that the inflation rate would take off if output growth exceeded 2.5%-3% because this would push unemployment below some natural rate leading to a wage-price spiral. </p> <p>Experience has shown that the concept of a natural rate of unemployment is a theoretical construct with no empirical counterpart that can be identified. </p> <p>It all depends on wage behaviour. Not so long ago, the natural rate of unemployment in the US was said to be 8%. When unemployment came down to 7% without accelerating inflation, the natural rate was redefined as 7%. </p> <p>When unemployment came down to 6%, the natural rate was redefined again. Unemployment is now less than 4% and there is still no sign of accelerating inflation. </p> <p>The same story can be told for the UK. What both economies have demonstrated is the simple Keynesian point that sustained demand expansion can lead to sustained higher output growth without infla tion as long as supply responds and costs don't rise. Euroland would do well to take a leaf out of the Anglo-Saxon book and try the same medicine. </p> <p>In the present benign climate of wage negotiations - a far cry from the turbulent years of the 1970s when the golden age of growth without inflation of the 1950s and 1960s was brought to a sticky end - the most likely check on the growth of output will be the balance of payments. </p> <p>In Britain the deficit to GDP ratio is approximately 2%, while in the US it is 4%. Not even the US can go on borrowing indefinitely, although it is not easy to predict when the world's investors will at long last lose confidence in the strength of the almighty dollar. </p> <p>Until then, faster growth than experienced in the 1970s and 1980s, but perhaps not as fast as the 1990s, should be sustainable provided wage demands do not accelerate. </p> <p>The elasticity of productivity to output growth is not something temporary, and reserves of labour still exist to be tapped. </p> <p>\u0095 The Endogeneity of the Natural Rate of Growth, published in the forthcoming Cambridge Journal of Economics. </p> <p><strong>Tony Thirlwall is professor of applied economics at the University of Kent at Canterbury</strong></p>",
  "<p>The Cabinet Office minister, Mo Mowlam, yesterday denied cannabis was a \"gateway\" drug which could lead to heroin abuse and claimed alcohol was potentially far more damaging. </p> <p>Ms Mowlam, who is responsible for the government's drug policy coordination, said there was no scientific evidence that proved the gateway theory. </p> <p>Her views clash with the home secretary, Jack Straw, who has said cannabis is in itself harmful and leads to use of harder drugs. </p> <p>Ms Mowlam - who is known to hold more liberal views on cannabis legislation - also praised the recent Runciman report which called for the depenalisation of cannabis possession. </p> <p>She also urged greater consistency between forces in the handling of cases of possession of cannabis, suggesting the uneven rate of prosecutions was unhelpful. Last year 2,838 people went to prison for cannabis possession. </p> <p>She was speaking on BBC TV's On The Record in advance of Wednesday's publication of the government's annual drugs report. </p> <p>She intends to use the publication to highlight the success of the government's drug testing and treatment orders (DTTOs), a scheme which requires criminals to undertake drug treatment as an alternative to a custodial sentence. </p> <p>The use of orders, now going nationwide, appears to be reducing offenders' reliance on drugs. </p> <p>Research published last week shows that of the 288 offenders in three pilot areas made subject to a DTTO, the average weekly spend on drugs showed a 94% fall from \u00a3400 in the month before the arrest to \u00a334 in the first few weeks of the order. </p> <p>In total 210 offenders were sentenced to a DTTO, nearly three quarters of offenders recommended to the court for an order. </p> <p>The orders are available to offenders aged 16 and over found guilty of offences leading to custodial sentences ranging between six months and three years.</p>",
  "<p><strong>There's no place like moan</strong></p> <p>Another weekend has brought on another bout of depression for football fans across the country. And guess what? That includes Spurs supporters!</p> <p>After George Graham's side beat Sunderland on Saturday, <strong>Jonathan Rose</strong> writes: \"One win does not make Spurs a good team. I am embarrassed when I watch Arsenal and see the football their team plays. The standard at the worst patch in any Arsenal game is on par with that which earns applause at Spurs.</p> <p>\"Tottenham need to bring in at least three WORLD CLASS players to have a chance of breaking into the self-perpetuating elite group of clubs who can attract the world's best players without having to pay Middlesbrough wages. Leeds are threatening to do this. I hope George Graham can put Spurs on a similar path.\"</p> <p><strong>96stsma</strong> is similarly unconvinced. \"I feel that Graham and Sugar should get out,\" he writes (in capitals as well). \"Although we won yesterday, over half of faithful Spurs supports know that it is time for them to go. I feel that Glenn Hoddle should come in as he is a true Tottenham boy.\"</p> <p>But if you think Spurs fans complain too much for a team in the upper reaches of the Premiership, just check out this from <strong>Brian Reid</strong>. \"The two goals Manchester United scored against Coventry highlight the problems United face in Europe,\" he writes.</p> <p>\"Neither goal would have been scored against half-decent European opposition. Andy Cole wouldn't have got so much space at the near post to score his, and David Beckham's shot would have been easily stopped by a better goalkeeper.</p> <p>\"United score a lot of their goals in the Premiership not by being inspiring or creative, but by simply exploiting the defensive lapses of other teams that usually occur by the bucketload. When they come up against a good, well-organised European side, they find this approach just doesn't work. They then find themselves bereft of ideas, and just come charging at the opposition in desperation at the end of a match. Over and over again, they struggle in this way in Europe. Isn't it time that Alex Ferguson admitted there was something wrong?\"</p> <p>But while the collapse of Old Trafford is imminent, Liverpool are in even worse shape. According to <strong>Rod Shaw</strong>, anyway. \"It was not the brilliance of Viduka that beat Liverpool,\" he says, \"but their abysmal defence once again. Can you imagine Arsenal or Manchester United surrendering a two-goal lead or gifting goals like the first one for Leeds?</p> <p>\"Hyypia is too slow for Premier League football,\" he goes on, \"as was evidenced by his absence when all four goals were scored. Ziege was supposed to guard the Liverpool left flank where all the Leeds goals came from. His gift for the first goal would have disgraced a schoolboy playing his first game of football. I hope he is not paid by performance as he would owe the club money.</p> <p>\"Babbel was not much better. No team expecting to win the Premiership can afford to score three goals and still lose a game, and the fanatically loyal fans deserve better than this mob is serving up.\"</p> <p>Do Carlisle fans have anything to add at this point?</p> <p><strong>A celebrity writes </strong></p> <p>Rodent secret agent Danger Mouse gets in touch to register his opinion in the big Svennis debate. \"Yes, the English FA got it half right by getting a foreign coach,\" he says, \"but for full marks they'll now have to talk Fifa into allowing foreigners to play for England. Then England will probably win a match or two.\"</p> <p>And with that, goodnight.</p>",
  "<p>I had been hassling BT Openworld's press office for an ADSL connection since August (allegedly they are so popular with journalists that there's a waiting list stretching up to Christmas). So when, two weeks ago, a phone call came out of the blue from a BT engineer, saying he was round the corner and was ready to fit me up, I didn't even mind that it was 8am and I was still dreaming. After all, I was about to be initiated in the joys of always-on, flat-rate, super-fast broadband access - the internet as God (or Microsoft) had always intended it. </p> <p>In the UK, ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) is supplied by BT, HomeChoice and a few ISPs, although from next year 14 other companies, including Cable and Wireless, Easynet, Telewest, NTL and MCI Worldcom, will begin installing their equipment in BT's local exchanges and rolling out retail services. The central benefits of BT's IPStream include speeds up to 10 times faster than a good modem, with 500 kbps downstream and 250 kbps upstream, and the ability to use the phone simultaneously, as well as enabling the use of rich media such as webcasts and video clips. </p> <p>The jury is still out on whether ADSL is the most suitable connection for small businesses, let alone domestic use. It has major drawbacks, say its detractors: it's clunky for two-way communications such as video-conferencing; it makes systems highly vulnerable to malicious hacking and as yet BT doesn't offer a Firewall protection plan; it suffers frequently from \"Crosstalk\" (when telecom signals interfere with each other) and \"brownouts\" (when there are bandwidth \"log jams\"), although BT claims these problems will disappear this month when it switches all internet connections to a new network. There are even doubts that BT wants ADSL to become mass market since, as the various \"surftime\" packages have proven, it will put an enormous strain on the network. In some central areas, connection speeds have already dropped by 25% because of broadband, which is \"bandwidth competitive\". </p> <p>Since my surfing habits have been doubling my quarterly phone bill, I worked out that even with the \u00a3150 installation fee and the \u00a339.99 a month USB-type subscription, ADSL would be worth it. Conven tional surftime packages just don't work for freelancers who use the net heavily in the day. </p> <p>One week, six hour-long phone calls to Openworld's support line and several technology-induced tantrums later, having still failed to find anyone who could tell me how I could pick up my email from my existing Demon account through my new BTClick ISP (one even suggested there was a software clash), and having enjoyed only 20 minutes of spontaneous, free-flowing access before the connection disappeared altogether, I was starting to feel like a long-suffering rail commuter in the comfort of my own home. </p> <p>Apparently the local area server was down and it took engineers three days to rectify the problem. It was restored on Monday, only to be replaced by another BT recorded message saying it was \"experiencing network connection problems\" and if I was calling about anything else, I should hang on (what for - a chat?) - at which point, I reverted to using my old 56k modem, which at least I knew I could trust. </p> <p>Admittedly, it is early days for BT, which promises to have overcome all teething problems by the time it hard launches early next year. And you can't really blame the poor techies stuck in a low-rent call centre in Aberdeen. One of them confessed that he had never seen an ADSL connection in his life (they are too remote) and wasn't allowed to surf at work any more since the Orange- gate staff porn scandal - he had nothing but a manual to work from! I am still hugely grateful to Jamie who taught me handy PC-rage tips such as wrapping it in bubble wrap before punching the life out of it and putting a rope around the base of the terminal before throttling it. </p> <p>Technical grouches aside, how did broadband actually enhance my experience of the internet? Ironically, one of the first rich media delights I got to sample (once the servers were up again, and I had downloaded RealPlayer Plus) was a Reuters video news broadcast about how Openworld would \"dramatically influence the way people work\", with secure environments for online transactions, video conferencing, and so on. BT is marketing the business package hard at \u00a399.99 a month. </p> <p>The first noticeable improvement is speed. I am connected at 576,000 bps (10 times faster than usual, although it can drop to 56,000 at certain times of day), and have been for seven hours and 30 minutes. I am listening to an ABC news broadcast about the US election as I type, and simultaneously searching the archives of newspapers. Which is pretty cool. My email problem now resolved, messages flow in and out as easily as water from a tap. There's another one now - probably more spam from sites such as Shockwave, AtomFilms and MP3, to which I now feel obliged to subscribe. </p> <p>The problem with most UK media sites is that they are still stuck in the 20th century - functional, html-based and pretty shallow. I can now listen to any BBC radio channel as I work, which is great, except that ADSL can be disabled by interference from AM signals. I tried in vain to find the promised broadband offerings from the likes of Channel 4, Carlton Interactive and Granada Broadband, but they appear to be months behind schedule. Virtual newscaster Ananova, however, is a total switch-off - like listening to the synthetic female voice of the speaking clock reading a bedtime story, and her green hair and relentless bulletins about the Beckhams make one feel quite queasy. Reuters video news and <a href=\"http://www.ITN.com\">www.ITN.com</a> were exciting for live-action breaking news, with storm reports from around the country, but it has more impact when you watch it on TV. </p> <p> Yet again, you have to look to American sites for a more satisfying streaming media experience. The US has had broadband for a couple of years and there is already a good range of channels such as CNN and ABC news, the Discovery Channel (with live coverage of the Ebola crisis in Africa) and Space.com (the latest transmissions from Mars) and, best of all, Comedy Central, where you can get South Park on tap and Jon Stewart's Daily Show, satirical coverage of the presidential election which has become cult viewing. Download times are 15 times faster - quick enough for you to hang on rather than give up, making the whole experience dangerously addictive. </p> <p>Street.TV, a style and culture channel, is one of the UK's first tentative broadband offerings. But with low-grade live interviews with the likes of singer Sophie Ellis- Bextor and Sadie Frost (yet again) on how great it is being married to Jude, and some non-event fashion show coverage, it's hardly the kind of must-see viewing that would drag you away from Jerry Springer even. Lack of quality control will continue to be a problem with internet media. </p> <p>What the net now does really well is comedy, underground film and satire, as evidenced by the rash of online film and media clubs. There are hours of fun to be had checking out the spoof trailers in <a href=\"http://www.trailervision.com,\">www.trailervision.com,</a> such as American Booty (Man Falls Madly in Love with Fat Ass), the Hollywood spoofs on <a href=\"http://www.Ifilm.com\">www.Ifilm.com</a> (the Oz Witch Project, in which DVD-toting Dorothy gets Toto, Tinman, Lion and Scarecrow into a spot of bother in the woods, is a brilliant foil to Blair Witch 2), and <a href=\"http://www.Shockwave.com\">www.Shockwave.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.MediaTrip.com\">www.MediaTrip.com</a> are great for pop video spoofs and new animation. There is no doubt that the new South Park is out there somewhere. </p> <p>Good British sites such as <a href=\"http://www.thejunkies.com\">www.thejunkies.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.madcowTV.com\">www.madcowTV.com</a> are beginning to sprout, but it will be another six months before broadband content is good enough to justify an ADSL connection in the home (and before the prices become competitive). In the short term, the most obvious consumer benefit would be multi- terminal connections for libraries and schools, but at the current price it is unlikely to happen.</p>",
  "The operation to separate conjoined twins Jodie and Mary, which began this morning, will mean that only Jodie will live to be three months old, a landmark she reaches on Wednesday. <p>Surgery began early this morning after a protracted legal battle over the ethics of the case. The girls' parents had said God should decide their fate, but doctors prevailed in the courts by arguing that both twins would die if they did not act.</p> <p>A huge team of doctors, nurses, anaesthetists and other health workers are involved in the complex surgery, which will result in an uncertain future even for the stronger sister. </p> <p>Mary is certain to die as soon as the aorta she shares with Jodie is severed during the surgery. Jodie's heart and lungs are keeping both girls alive through blood vessels which connect them. </p> <p>Experts predict Jodie has a 5% risk of dying on the operating table, but after that her problems will be functional rather than life threatening. </p> <p>Medical opinion varies but doctors say there is a chance she could be doubly incontinent and will need to have reconstruction of her rectum, sexual organs and lower abdomen. </p> <p>She will need extensive skin grafts - possibly using tissue from her dead sister - and is expected to spend the first five years of her life in hospital. Extensive X-rays and scans of the twins were taken in a bid to gain as much knowledge as possible of what they would find when surgery began, but there was still uncertainty about the exact extent of their condition. </p> <p>What is known is that the girls are joined at the lower abdomen, with their spines fused, and that they share Jodie's heart and lungs. </p> <p>Mary has a heart but it is useless and her lungs never inflated after her system failed at birth. While Jodie is considered to be functioning normally, Mary has a primitive brain and her life was not considered by doctors to be \"viable\". </p> <p>Cases of conjoined twins are so rare - around one per 100,000 live births - and the ways in which they can be joined so different, that there is little precedent for this latest case. </p> <p>In the UK, only Great Ormond Street hospital in London and St Mary's hospital in Manchester, where the twins' operation is taking place, have any experience of separating conjoined twins. </p> <p>At St Mary's, all three attempts have resulted in the deaths of the twins. </p> <p>Closed circuit television is being used during the operation so that teams of specialists can watch its progress while preventing overcrowding of the operating theatre. </p> <p>There will inevitably be a moment of silence as Mary's life ebbs away, and the battle to save Jodie begins in earnest. </p> <p> <b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,393401,00.html\">Operation to separate twins starts</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4067066,00.html\">23 September: Tough Justice - Comment</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4063823,00.html\">15 September: Hate that dare not speak its name - Comment by Kevin Toolis</a><br> <a href=\"http://guardian-dev.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4061390,00.html\">9 September, 2000: The point where the law, ethics, religion and humanity are baffled - Analysis</a><br></p> <p> <b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7a95d\">Talk about it</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com\" target=\"_new\">Conjoined Twins</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.twinstuff.com/conjoined.htm\" target=\"_new\">Twin Stuff: conjoined twins</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.prolifealliance.org.uk/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Pro-Life Alliance</a><br> <a href=\"http://outside.cmht.nwest.nhs.uk/cmhtnet/internet/hospitals/stmary.htm\" target=\"_new\">St Mary's hospital</a></p>",
  "<p>If, in the final accounting, I am remembered for nothing else, at least I will be remembered as the man who ruined literature once and for all. Of course there are those who will argue that Jackie Collins beat me to this long ago - and she may in fact have won in the distaff category - but according to more than a few folks here in America, I am the winner. So if you're looking for some way into the record books, look elsewhere. The blame for the ruination of the literary form known as the novel has been laid at my feet, so bugger off - this one's mine. </p> <p>How did I do it? Simple. I became the first novelist to use product placement in a work of fiction. Product placement, for you literary purists, is a form of advertising previously restricted to the famously whorish mediums of television and film. One of the earliest and most famous examples of product placement was in Steven Spielberg's 1982 film ET: The Extra-Terrestrial. </p> <p>The way I understand it, the script originally called for the kids in the story to use M&amp;M candies to lure the wrinkled little space guest into their home. However when the producers contacted the candy-maker and suggested it pay for the privilege of having its product featured in the film, the candy-maker balked. So the producers contacted the maker of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and asked if it would be interested. It was, and sales of Reese's soared when the film was released. Ever since, film- makers and advertisers have expanded their unholy alliance. Now, when MI6 gives James Bond a BMW you can rest assured that somebody gave one to the film's producer as well. </p> <p>Flash forward 16 years. I'm in the throes of writing Cross Dressing, a satire on religion and advertising. My research has me neck-deep in obscure Catholic theology and modern advertising theory when a thought occurs to me. Sadly, it isn't an idea about character development or an ingenious plot twist. Rather it is about how to get some publicity for the book's release. </p> <p>Why would such crass considerations ever cross my mind? The answer is, again, simple. I'm in the business of writing books. Unfortunately it's not enough just to write them; they must be marketed as well. And, in the US at least, publishers are not famous for how well they market the books of their mid-list authors. Without marketing, fewer people know about your book. When fewer people know about your book, fewer buy it. When fewer people buy your book, you'll soon be looking for a new publishing contract. Thus the crass consideration. </p> <p>Before my first novel (Pest Control) was published I asked what sort of publicity campaign the publisher would do for it. My agent said it would send copies to reviewers and hope for the best. Fortunately, debut novels are considered newsworthy - especially when they sell to a major Hollywood studio as Pest Control did - and thus the book received a fair amount of attention in the press. </p> <p>Before my second book, The Organ Grinders, was published I was told to lower my expectations about press coverage. As my US publicist explained, \"Author publishes second novel\" isn't considered a newsworthy item. Without a good angle, I was told, it was nigh impossible to get PR for a second novel not written by a best-selling author. </p> <p>I was left to my own devices to find an \"angle\" for Cross Dressing. As I said, it came to me while writing. Since my protagonist is a hotshot in the advertising business and since much of the book satirises American hyper-consumerism, I thought it might be considered \"newsworthy\" (and ironic) if I made Cross Dressing the first novel to feature product placement. </p> <p>My US editor loved the idea, but said I would have to make the deal on my own as the company wouldn't have a clue where to start. After a few quick calls I had a list of companies interested in helping to make literary history. On the list was a fast-food chain, a cosmetics company and a liquor distributor. For reasons of artistic integrity and pure laziness I wanted a product that was already in the book. I felt this strategy would shield me from accusations of writing to accommodate a \"sponsor\", while simultaneously saving me the trouble of writing any new pages. </p> <p>The novel doesn't feature anyone enjoying fast food or applying cosmetics, but there were a few scenes involving cocktails. Then another idea hit me. I had sold the book's film rights to Universal Studios. Universal (at the time) was owned by Seagrams. Two calls resulted in a deal wherein I would replace references to generic drinks with various Seagrams products. </p> <p>Now, before all this happened, I was under the impression that money changed hands in a product placement deal. Since I was doing this for publicity, not cash, I thought I might do the deal for a single dollar, or I would donate the money to a charity. However, when I discovered the deals were typically done in exchange for the \"placed\" product (in this instance, hooch) I had to re- evaluate my position. It would be more than a little insensitive to send a couple of cases of single malt scotch to the Diseased Liver Association, am I right? So I accepted (and disposed of) them in my own selfless way. </p> <p>Just before the book came out, my publisher sent copies of Cross Dressing to magazines and newspapers, with letters explaining the product placement deal in the hopes of generating some publicity. It worked. Brill's Content and Publisher's Weekly did articles on the deal. Time magazine and Entertainment Weekly both made mention of it as well. </p> <p>The only problem was, no one seemed to get the joke. It was clear from the articles that certain people in the book world were taking exception to the deal. The gist of what they were saying was that I had cheapened either literature in general, or the novel form in particular. </p> <p>For example, in Sean Gullette's article for Brill's Content (June 2000), Jonathan Galassi, editor-in-chief at Farrar, Straus and Giroux, is quoted as saying about the deal, \"Well, I think it's pretty lame.\" </p> <p>Well, imagine my shame. Such a stinging indictment was hard to swallow, but what really bothered me was that poor Johnny boy just didn't get it. And he wasn't alone. Since so many are having a problem getting this, allow me to explain. </p> <p>Cross Dressing lampoons the advertising industry. To do something as brazen as product placement in something as sacred as a novel is to make a joke on the subject. Now, had I done a product placement deal in a book that had nothing to do with advertising, that would have been selling out. As I said earlier, if I'd had to add drinking scenes to the book to accommodate the product, that, too, would have been selling out. But what I did was to name the drinks that were already in the book - in fact the names are so overstated in ad-speak as to be a joke. Get it? In a book ridiculing advertising? Ta-da! Irony. </p> <p>While I had anticipated a mild backlash to the deal, it never occurred to me anyone would attack it so viciously. I mean the notion that my product placement deal could harm literature in some way that my novels hadn't already done was just plain silly. As if by this time next year, Annie Proulx will be revising her latest manuscript to oblige a corporate sponsor, substituting a nicely placed scene involving the \"new condom for cowboys\" at the expense of mood or real character development. </p> <p>\"But Bill,\" someone cried, \"doesn't this deal fundamentally cheapen the novel as a form of literature?\" No, of course not. You want to know what does? The pitiful advances so many novelists get. That's what cheapens the novel. But me? I lack the influence, thank you very much. </p> <p>Still, some tut-tutting critics say I crossed a line no one else had dared to cross before. As if there are thousands of authors out there who had considered doing a product placement deal for their novel, but decided the whole transaction would sully literature and, thus, in defence of the Muses they decided not to do it. </p> <p>Pur-leeze. All I can say is, that's pretty lame.</p>",
  "<p>Johnny Depp is to play the controversial 16th-century poet and playwright Christopher Marlowe in a new British film, Marlowe. Natural Nylon, the production company owned and run by Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, Sean Pertwee, Sadie Frost and Jude Law will produce the movie, and German firm Advanced Medien, will co-finance the $20m project.

The poet was killed in a Deptford pub brawl when he was 29 in 1593, and controversy still surrounds his brief but colourful life. Some claim that he was a spy, or that he was killed by government agents - his professed atheism and homosexuality making him a dangerous destabilising influence.</p> <p>The film will focus on Marlowe's relationship with William Shakespeare, and is based on the long-argued theory - dismissed as bogus by most academics - that Marlowe had a hand in some of Shakespeare's early plays. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.luminarium.org/renlit/marlowe.htm\" target=\"_new\">More about</a> Christopher Marlowe.</p>",

Bold, confident, and good-looking are the words he uses to describe himself, but he doesn't stop there, oh no, 80s throwback Curry boasts that he is gorgeous, sexy, tender and brave. The rules of internet celebritydom are strict indeed: contenders have to be completely self-obsessed, have no concept of their real shortcomings and have an obsession with sex.

  "<p>Ask Lis Howell, a woman who has devoted her life to television, why she made the leap into the uncharted waters of the internet at the age of almost 50, and you'll get a decisive answer that could warm the cockles of many a disenchanted old TV exec's heart. \"It's good for the soul,\" she says.</p> <p>She's not sure her family would agree, however. She has worked flat out, spending weekends in the office, to get the website, bowlofcherries.com, up and running on time. The website, a community-focused magazine site for over-35s with something of a celebrity edge, made its debut, as planned, last Tuesday. </p> <p>The five partners in the company - Ola Steinsrud, David Hurst, Jane McCormick, Alyson Pearce and Howell herself - each stumped up cash to get the venture off the ground, and a private investor, a friend Howell declines to name, managed to ramp up the total launch fund to \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>Howell is chief executive; Hurst, previously publishing director of Financial Times Business, is managing director. McCormick, who has worked as a journalist for the Sun, the Sunday Mirror, the Sunday Express, GMTV and Reuters, is editor-in-chief. Pearce, who has experience in showbusiness, the media and the hospitality industry, is events director. Steinsrud, the founder of TVNorge, Norway's first commercial TV station, will be new media consultant. </p> <p>Given the option of being backed by Howell's former company Flextech, where she was senior vice-president of Flextech Channels, the five partners didn't think what was on the table was worthwhile, even though it would have had PR value and involved support marketing. They also decided to avoid the complex venture capital route. Instead, with gritty determination, they opted to go it alone. </p> <p>Will it work? Not even Howell seems 100% certain. She says that the project is safe until Christmas, by which time it needs to have established a good revenue model. </p> <p>Howell may have a strong record in TV but, as everyone has learned from the past year, the internet is a whole different ball game, and top teams don't necessarily equal automatic success. However, if energy and enthusiasm could guarantee success in the cut-throat world of the internet, bowlofcherries would be an instant success story. </p> <p>But who's to say it won't be a success? With a strong, experienced management team behind it, a good well-researched niche market to target and no malevolent venture capitalist on its back, it perhaps stands a better chance than many. It has already got off to a springing start, with, according to Howell, almost 100 pre-launch subscriptions taken out. At \u00a3100 a pop for a year's members' benefits, that's a nice \u00a310,000 in the bank after its first week. </p> <p>\"The site has hit a nerve already and we're starting off with no debt because we've covered all the start-up costs with our own money. We've done our research and we know there is a market out there for us,\" says Howell, reeling off some research bowlofcherries commissioned from BMRB in the summer. More than 10.5m people over 35 now use the internet for pleasure; 7% said they would pay a subscription if they thought it gave them something; they constitute the fastest growing sector of the internet; and they know what they want - mainly relevant information and good conversation. To this end, bowlofcherries aims to provide users with information about everything from decorating and gardening to cooking and travel, top-and-tailed with a bit of celebrity opinion. The company is entering a market that has yet to be tapped. While the number of websites for people over 45 or under 25 has spiralled, no one has yet developed a website targeted at both sexes over 35.</p> <p>Other revenues from advertising and e-commerce will kick in later, but the subscription-based model should give bowlofcherries a good foundation on which to build. Additionally, the site has signed e-commerce and content deals with Tesco, the RAC and Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, the upmarket gift shop. </p> <p>For their \u00a3100, bowlofcherries club members will get a free gift from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn and an organised social calendar, including wine tastings, tennis tournaments and weekly cocktail parties where club members can meet the 50 personalities who write for the site. Members also have access to experts (such as a personal celebrity shopper) and get discounts on some goods.</p> <p>Club members will even be encouraged to strike up personal email conversations with the stars - a list that includes Toyah Wilcox, Michael Cole, Fern Britton, Edwina Currie and Jilly Johnson - who will be writing for the website. </p> <p>The rest of the website and all the content are free, but Howell says that the celebrity involvement and the weekly parties are its unique selling point. \"It's not about glamour, it's about conversations,\" she says. </p> <p>Howell says she's having the time of her life and now sees the TV industry as stale and unwilling to change with the times. She's glad she made the move and likes the new-found sense of control over the whole project - a far cry from the enveloping bureaucracy at her former employers, Flextech, GMTV and BSkyB. </p> <p>More than anything, and not just because she and her partners have money riding on the success of bowlofcherries.com, she is determined that this new venture is one of the few dot.com start-ups that survive. Could she be trying to prove a point to her former colleagues?</p>",
  "A complex 15-hour operation to separate conjoined twins Jodie and Mary is under way, health officials said today. <p>The surgery at St Mary's hospital, Manchester, will almost certainly mean the death of the weaker twin Mary but should give her sister Jodie the chance of a relatively normal life. </p> <p>In a statement the hospital said: \"We can confirm the operation is taking place today.This complex operation is expected to last approximately 15 hours and involves a team of up to 20 staff.\" </p> <p>The twins were born in August and the original timetable for the operation was that it should be carried out in the first three months of the twins' lives. </p> <p>On Friday, the Prolife Alliance failed in two dramatic court attempts to halt the operation. </p> <p>First the high court, and then the court of appeal, rejected an application to have the official solicitor, Laurence Oates, removed as Mary's legal guardian and replaced by the Alliance's director, Bruno Quintaville. </p> <p>The separation is the climax to a legal battle which started nearly three months ago. </p> <p>Doctors went to the high court in August and won the right to separate the twins despite their parents objections. They are devout Roman Catholics from the Maltese island of Gozo and are opposed to the operation on religious grounds. </p> <p>In September they launched a privately funded appeal against the high court decision which they subsequently lost. </p> <p>The twins are joined at the abdomen with arms and legs at right angles to their conjoined upper bodies. Their spines are fused. </p> <p>Mary is described as having \"primitive brain\" functions while Jodie is thought to have normal mental functions. Mary is draining the life from her sister as she relies on her for oxygen and blood circulation. </p> <p>It has been reported that their parents have agreed a TV deal with Granada to appear on Tonight with Trevor McDonald. Money they are paid for their interview will be put into a trust to pay for Jodie's medical care once she has been separated from her twin. </p> <p>Pro-life campaigners described the operation as \"eugenic\". A spokesman for ProLife Alliance, claimed Mary's life was being extinguished because she was mentally impaired. </p> <p>A spokesman said: \"It is difficult not to see certain eugenic parallels in the series of judgments against baby Mary in the past weeks. These are very sad times for English law and English medicine.\"</p> <p> <b>Related stories:</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4067066,00.html\">23 September: Tough Justice - Comment</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4063823,00.html\">15 September: Hate that dare not speak its name - Comment by Kevin Toolis</a><br> <a href=\"http://guardian-dev.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4061390,00.html\">9 September, 2000: The point where the law, ethics, religion and humanity are baffled - Analysis</a><br></p> <p> <b>Useful links:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com\" target=\"_new\">Conjoined Twins</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.twinstuff.com/conjoined.htm\" target=\"_new\">Twin Stuff: conjoined twins</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.prolifealliance.org.uk/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Pro-Life Alliance</a><br> <a href=\"http://outside.cmht.nwest.nhs.uk/cmhtnet/internet/hospitals/stmary.htm\" target=\"_new\">St Mary's Hospital</a></p>",

  "<p>Channel 5 directors have drawn up plans for a 50% increase in the broadcaster's programming budget next year to \u00a3180m. </p> <p>The figure, up from \u00a3120m this year, is designed to underpin the repositioning of the channel away from its reliance on cheap imports and soft porn. </p> <p>Directors from RTL, the pan-European media group which now controls Channel 5, are understood to be backing the increase. The prospect of a significantly higher investment could prove the catalyst for Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media to make a decision on whether it wants to remain as a shareholder. </p> <p>United owns 35% of Channel 5 but is expected to quit the television market entirely after selling its three ITV franchises earlier this year. </p> <p>Neither Lord Hollick nor RTL chief executive Didier Bellens have yet rubber-stamped the increase in the programming budget, which is planned to take effect from January 2001. </p> <p>Channel 5 will hope the extra cash will give the station new impetus. Since gaining control earlier this year, RTL has made it clear it wants to reshape the channel away from some of its more lurid content and into a more mainstream market. </p> <p>The decision to reposition the channel was clearly illustrated 10 days ago when Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein was asked to leave the company. He was replaced by director of programming Dawn Airey. </p> <p>A Channel 5 spokesman declined to comment on exact figures, but said: \"Channel 5 managers have been pressing for an increased investment and we are awaiting feedback.\" </p> <p>Channel 5 launched 3 years ago with a programming budget of only \u00a3100m. At the time it faced considerable criticism relating to the quality of reception and programming but has nevertheless managed to build an impressive consituency among viewers. </p> <p>The channel has an audience share of 6% and RTL recently said the channel was aiming for a share of 10% within two to three years. Channel 5 has continued to attract criticism and was dubbed \"channel filfth\" by the more tub-thumping press. Many thought the broadcaster plumbed new depths when it aired a gameshow called Naked Jungle fronted by a nude Keith Chegwin. </p> <p>Richard Eyre, director of strategy and content for RTL and former head of the ITV network, is fully behind the higher investment, sources said. Mr Eyre confirmed in September that the mix of programming will change with a greater emphasis on original material. He said particular attention would be paid to drama in order to attract viewers away from the BBC and ITV. </p> <p>Channel 5 moved into profit during the first six months of the year, with an operating surplus of \u00a31.8m. </p> <p>RTL has made it plain that it would be keen to acquire the 35% of Channel 5 still owned by United News &amp; Media. </p> <p>Lord Hollick is refocusing United News around business information and is at present in negotiations with several potential buyers of his Express Newspapers division. The conglomerate Hinduja Group, which has made a bid in the region of \u00a3120m, is in discussions with Trinity Mirror to handle distribution of the titles if its bid is successful.</p>",

It's a ridiculous situation,\" said Noel Plumb of the Colong Foundation for Wilderness.</p> <p>\"Horses are very hard hooved whereas Australian native animals have soft pads.</p> <p>\"Many of our soils are poor and easily erodable, so when large mobs of horses move about these landscapes they quickly do a lot of damage,\" Mr Plumb explained.</p> <p>The horses congregate around water, trampling banks, fouling water and damaging aquatic life and the water habitats of unique mammals such as platypuses.</p> <p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) said its first aerial cull was long overdue and had only been made possible after bush fires had cleared out undergrowth, enabling helicopters to track and kill the horses.</p> <p>Conservationists also pointed out that it is during periods where trees and plants sprout back after fires that native plants are most vulnerable to being eaten by the horses.</p> <p>However, the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) said that aerial culling should only be considered in Australia's dry open plains, where helicopters could easily track and put down injured animals without causing undue suffering.</p> <p>\"The very rugged forest terrain in the Guy Fawkes national park is not suitable for this because of the obvious difficulty in conducting the operation in the most humane manner possible,\" said vice president Dr Garth McGilvray.</p> <p>Animal welfare groups suggest that birth control methods could be a more humane alternative to sharpshooters in helicopters.</p> <p>But this requires horses to be rounded up, which is deemed impractical after 17 attempts to round up wild horses in New South Wales national parks in the last decade only resulted in the culling of around 150 horses.</p> <p>It is also claimed that the slow and expensive mustering of horses is more stressful than aerial culling.</p> <p>AVA president Dr Tony English is leading the inquiry into the culling. It have already condemned the \"lack of concern by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) for the welfare of the many horses which suffered terribly in this incident\".</p> <p>Conservationists fear that the suspension of culling will give the mobs of horses more time to damage the rugged and yet fragile cliffs and gullies of the Great Dividing Range.</p> <p>While the inquiry talks, the horses roam free. There is no man from Snowy River to round them up.</p> <p><b>\"Then they lost him for a moment, where two mountain gullies met<br> In the ranges, but a final glimpse reveals<br> On a dim and distant hillside the wild horses racing yet, <br> With the man from Snowy River at their heels\"<br></b></p> <p><br><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:patrick.barkham@theguardian.com\">patrick.barkham@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/ausref/0,2759,180854,00.html\">Australia and the monarchy</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/sydney\">Sydney olympics 2000</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28patrick+barkham%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=patrick+barkham&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Patrick Barkham</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/\" target=\"_new\">Sydney Morning Herald</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/\" target=\"_new\">Australia Broadcasting Corporation</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/\" target=\"_new\">The Age</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.asiapulse.com/\" target=\"_new\">Asia Pulse</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.uq.edu.au/~mlwham/banjo/the_man_from_snowy_river.html\" target=\"_new\">The Man from Snowy River </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.colongwilderness.org.au/default.htm\" target=\"_new\">The Colong Foundation for Wilderness </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.npws.nsw.gov.au/\" target=\"_new\">New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ava.com.au/\" target=\"_new\">Australia Veterinary Association </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.rspca.org.au/\" traget=\"_new\">RSPCA Australia</a></p>",

  "The murder of Zahid Mubarek at Feltham young offenders' institution (Sick institution in need of urgent cure, November 3) is yet another indictment of the prison service's failure to implement its excellent race policies and its inability to protect and treat all people with equity and fairness, irrespective of their colour. <p>I have more than 18 years of association with the criminal justice system, including as a member of the prison service's race relations policy group. Ethnic minority prisoners and staff - and indeed members of boards of visitors like myself - continue to be treated like a herd of cattle in these bigoted institutions. Over the years I have become tired of hearing the same hypocritical apologies by successive director-generals of the prison service whenever there is a race incident. </p> <p>The so-called independent board of visitors, many of whom are also magistrates, ought to be in a position to monitor the way that mentally disturbed and rabidly racist people are allowed to remain in such institutions. Yet their training has never covered race awareness. There is little hope that under the present apartheid culture, multiracial imprisonment will achieve much success. <br><b>Anver Jeevanjee</b><br> Member, board of visitors, Winchester prison </p> <p>\u0095 Zahid Mubarek was convicted of the theft of \u00a36 worth of razor blades and tampering with a car and sentenced to 90 days in Feltham - where he paid with his life. Two murder suspects in the Stephen Lawrence case were fined \u00a3100 each for stealing 14 kegs of alcohol from a pub (Lawrence pair stole drink, November 3). Why was Zahid in that prison in the first place? Racist justice, or what? <br><b>Ulrike Preuss</b><br> London </p> <p>\u0095 A racist with a known history of violence is put in a youth custody cell with a young British Asian who, arguably, should never have been imprisoned in the first place. It results in a vicious racist killing. So much for the state's duty of care, and so much for taking racism seriously. Thirteen years ago we wrote: \"Of increasing concern is the number of cases of assault, neglect or ill-treatment of black people in custody ... Racism is institutionalised and rooted in the agencies of law enforcement and imprisonment.\" We were dismissed as ultra-leftists whose politics warped our academic analysis. </p> <p>Since then, along with the Institute of Race Relations, Inquest and the Runnymede Trust, we have continued to monitor and research controversial deaths using whatever paltry funding we can access. Despite sustaining and publishing this work, not one of the institutions responsible for the safe custody of men, women and children in prison has consulted with us or commissioned further research. <br><b>Dr Kathryn Chadwick<br>Prof Phil Scraton</b><br> Edge Hill University College </p> <p>\u0095 In 1993 I helped establish Britain's first prison radio station at Feltham young offenders' institution and I am now involved in programmes to combat the appalling problems there. Yes, it needs greater investment and the government should reappraise the \"benefits\" of locking up children and keeping young men on remand for far too long. But there is more immediate help closer at hand. </p> <p>Charitable trusts and foundations continue to invest in our ailing prison. With more than 15 voluntary agencies working inside Feltham, a committed and professional group of people, supported by governors and staff, is offering a wide range of programmes including essential first night support, counselling, numeracy and adult literacy support, mentoring, pre-release training, accommodation help, an advocacy programme and parenting skills. A much-needed multi-disciplinary skills workshop is being established for those over 18 and will be opened after Christmas. <br><b>Roma Hooper</b> <br>Friends of Feltham </p> <p>\u0095 There is no doubt that many of Feltham inmates have mental health problems with which the institution has struggled to cope. However, in the last year Feltham has acknowledged the extent of the problem and, in an innovative partnership with a local NHS trust, has made progress towards delivering mental health care at an equivalent level to that one would find in the NHS. </p> <p>As the clinical director of forensic mental health services for the local trust and one of the consultant forensic psychiatrists responsible for the care of inmates at Feltham, I think credit needs to be given to those who have worked hard to change the culture of mental health care at Feltham. <br><b>Dr Kevin Cleary</b><br> Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham Mental Health Trust </p> <p>\u0095 Do we need any further justification for Lord Woolf's recent decision to set a minimum tariff for the killers of James Bulger? Lord Woolf recently described the \"corrosive atmosphere\" in young offenders' institutions, reiterating the view of Sir David Ramsbotham, chief inspector of prisons, that conditions in them are \"unacceptable in a civilised society\", as Sir Stephen Tumim before him also held. Is it not time we stopped locking up young people, many of them children under 18, in them? <br><b>Veronica Plowden</b><br> Children's Rights Alliance for England</p>",
  "Schools all over France are expected to stop serving beef to children in their canteens, following the lead of many districts in Paris in responding to rising panic about the safety of French beef. <p>Europe's biggest beef exporter now finds itself the object of international distrust in its billion-pound meat industry after leading the campaign to bar British beef from Europe because of the risk from animals with BSE, mad cow disease. </p> <p>A total ban on French beef has been imposed by Hungary. Other countries, including Russia, are preparing to follow suit. Some French restaurants and butchers are refusing to sell beef on the bone. </p> <p>Many people now fear that eating beef could put them at risk of variant Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (vCJD), which is thought to come from the meat of cows that had BSE. </p> <p>So far this year no more than 80 cases of BSE have been diagnosed in France, including two new cases reported on Friday. Last year 31 cases were reported. </p> <p>Instead of reassuring consumers, the tightening of safety checks in June seems only to have increased public wariness after a series of recent food scandals ranging from infected duck liver pat\u00e9 to contaminated beef and lamb sausages. </p> <p>The reinforced monitoring is concentrated in Normandy. Whole herds are destroyed if one case of BSE is found. </p> <p>Public suspicion that the authorities might be concealing a wider outbreak was heightened last week when the Green movement, backed by President Jacques Chirac, demanded an immediate halt to sales of meat and bone meal from carcasses of cows for use as feed for poultry and pigs. </p> <p>It is still legal in France for these products to be used this way. </p> <p>Neither the publicly declared figures for BSE (expected to be no more than 100 animals this year), nor the two confirmed cases of vCJD are on the scale of the outbreak in Britain, where vCJD has killed 81 people since being identified by government scientists in late 1995. </p> <p>But there are fears that the numbers could rise sharply, in part because of better detection but also, because of reports of cheating by some cattle dealers and breeders trying to cover up the disease. </p> <p>The biggest shock was revealed a fortnight ago when some of France's most popular supermarket chains, led by Carrefour, admitted that a tonne of BSE-infected meat had been sold to customers after it got through the safety checks at an abattoir. </p> <p>This coincided with a government request to Afsa, the independent food safety agency, to study the possible dangers of beef on the bone, including T-bone steaks and a French favourite, cte de boeuf. </p> <p>Although under no obligation to react, the national steak restaurant chain Buffalo Grill withdrew the cuts from its menus this weekend and most butchers voluntarily followed suit. </p> <p>The mayors of 11 of Paris's 20 districts have banned beef entirely from school menus, a measure likely to be widely followed in the provinces. </p> <p>These actions prompted an urgent ministerial meeting as the weekend began, to try to calm public fears. </p> <p>The consumers' minister, Fran\u00e7ois Patriat, said there was no justification for an immediate withdrawal of bone meal while Afsa, which defied a EU ruling this year and outlawed the resumed import of British beef to France, said that a decision on bone meal would need at least four months' scientific study. </p> <p>Mr Chirac's spokesman said that even tighter monitoring was needed to stop BSE-infected cattle reaching abattoirs, but the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, said France has already taken the most stringent precautions of any country to control BSE. And a BSE specialist, Jeanne Brug\u00e8re-Picoux, said she was astonished at the latest panic, \"at a time when it is obvious that the maximum exposure to risk is well behind us because of increased inspection\". </p> <p>Estimates of losses to farmers vary widely, but supermarkets say that beef sales are down 25-40% . </p> <p>The farmers' union FNSEA is about to launch a publicity counter-offensive. Its slogan will be a traditional expression of self-satisfaction: \"Je suis bien dans mon assiette,\" literally, I'm OK in my plate.</p>",
  "Twenty five years after he died in mysterious circumstances and eight years after his remains were exhumed from beneath his successor's office, the former emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, was finally laid to rest yesterday. <p>His coffin was greeted by large crowds as it was carried through the streets of the capital, Addis Ababa. Awash with early morning light and against a background of wailing women, the procession was honoured by the regal, if ageing, imperial bodyguard, resplendent in lion's mane head-dresses. Soldiers who had fought under him stood to attention, wiping away tears as the cortege passed by. </p> <p>The patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox church gave a eulogy before the coffin was placed on a decorated flatbed lorry, which carried it to the vast Maskal Square. There it was greeted by 26 members of Haile Selassie's family, and Rita Marley, the widow of singer Bob Marley. Ms Marley is one of many Rastafarians who revere Haile Selassie as Ras (prince) Tafari, his title before ascending to the throne in 1930. </p> <p>Prince Beedemariam Mekonnen, Haile Selassie's grandson, said his grandfather was a symbol of proud independence for the rest of Africa.\"He was a father to all of us. Our king of kings.\" </p> <p>That contrasted with the official silence surrounding the reburial. Last week Meles Zenawi's government called Haile Selassie \"a tyrant and oppressor of the masses\". </p> <p>No officials attended the ceremony. </p> <p>The procession ended at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, where his grandsons, acting as pall bearers, carried the emperor's remains to their burial place.</p>",
  "The Italian government has tried to shore up its constitutional authority by blocking a referendum in Veneto, the region that includes Venice, on greater independence from Rome. <p>The wealthy region proposed a constitution last week which amounted to near secession raising the stakes in the northern battle for power and increasing the fear that Italy may break up. Rome will push its own diluted proposals for devolution through the senate this week.</p> <p>But the president of Veneto, Giancarlo Galan, vowed to press ahead with the referendum. Mr Galan, who belongs to the centre-right coalition which is expected to win next year's general election, wants to keep two-thirds of the tax revenues raised in Veneto and to control health, education, immigration, law and order, and elements of foreign policy.</p> <p>Francesco Rutelli, the centre-left's candidate for prime minister, denounced the plan as a recipe for a Yugoslavian-type disintegration, adding that the diversion of funds would force hospitals in the impoverished south to close.</p> <p>A cabinet meeting decided that a referendum could be called only by the central government. It would interfere with the devolution bill.</p> <p>Veneto's proposal raised the stakes in the north's game of cat and mouse with Rome. The regions of Lombardy and Piedmont, also controlled by the right, want to distance themselves from the south, which they regard as parasitic, corrupt and crime-infested.</p> <p>Agazio Loiero, the regional affairs minister, said blocking the referendum was safer than letting it go ahead and hoping it failed. Some colleagues said the block could give rise to a separatist backlash.</p> <p>It is uncertain that the devolution bill will be passed before the elections, due by April. Opinion polls suggest that the centre-right will thrash the government, which has promised but so far failed to deliver devolution.</p>",
  "To the Guinness Book of Records: reserve a whole page under hypocrisy. It's for George W Bush and the managers of his bid for the White House. They have run a campaign of character assassination. Knowing that Al Gore has an intimidating grasp of the issues, they have used every trick, every dollar of special interest money, every toady in the press, to smear the vice-president as a liar. The cleverness of that diversionary tactic was that if it worked it would relieve GW of giving proper answers to the questions of substance he finds so bewildering. <p>It worked. </p> <p>Now Bush is revealed as a liar on a serious issue of character. And what happens? The smear artists are shouting \"dirty politics\". </p> <p>Given the anti-Gore bias of the mainstream press, last Thursday night's revelation that Bush was arrested for drunken driving in 1976, when he was 30, may have come too late to affect his lead. The Republican spin machine has also been adept in damage control. Within 24 hours it had almost managed to turn the story into \"who leaked?\" instead of \"why didn't he come clean?' It is true the disclosure came from a Maine Democrat, though not from the Gore campaign. But the point is that it is true, and the real question is the character of the candidate who tried to conceal his past. </p> <p>He did confess to \"mistakes\" of his youth, but he would never be specific - hoping the \"mistakes\" would be thought of as youthful pranks, not serious crime. It is an offence to apply for any federal office without divulging an arrest record. Bush not only went to great lengths to cover up his conviction. He lied about it, too. In a 1998 interview, a Dallas Morning News reporter asked Bush point-blank if he had ever been arrested other than for a 1968 fraternity prank and Bush said flatly: \"No.\" The exchange was not reported at the time; it didn't seem newsworthy. And when Bush was called to jury service in a drunk-driving trial in Texas, he filled out the jury questionnaire, but left blank the yes-no entry asking if he had ever been accused in a civil or criminal case. Then he hastily got himself excused on the basis that he was the governor of the state. </p> <p>Imagine if this had been Al Gore! The Wall Street Journal, the most sedulous of the defamers, would have dispatched ferrets to find out what happened on the other form-filling occasions when \"the liar\" had to yield his record. Now the Journal, you bet, will be part of the great \"Smeargate\" diversion. </p> <p>Bush's handlers are saying, with some success, that his ready admission of the offence, when found out, is another sign of his probity. This sums up their entire campaign, one of breath-taking arrogance wrapped up in feel-good bromides. And they have got away with it. </p> <p>The basic misperception here is to confuse amiability with integrity, marketable charm with ability. The truth, bluntly, is that Bush is an irresponsible know-nothing. His instincts are those of the 1930s isolationist, little America, rather than the America that led the world in the creation of a new liberal world order. If he is president, say goodbye to the nuclear test ban, to action on global warming, to peacemaking interventions. </p> <p>Those of you in sodden Britain who might conclude that global warming, for instance, is a matter of concern should know that Bush, like the Wall Street Journal, regards it as a leftist scare. Asked what he would do, he responds that we need more study before ratifying the Kyoto agreement, putting me in mind of a fire chief who arrives at the blaze to say he will have to study the origins of the fire before trying to put it out. </p> <p> On social security, he has never throughout the entire campaign explained how he can take a trillion dollars and put it into personal accounts for mainly young workers without saying where the money will come from to secure the retirement payments for the rest of the ageing workforce. This weekend, attacking federalism, he did not even seem to realise that social security is a federal programme. Why hasn't the press blown the whistle? The economist Paul Krugman in the New York Times, a rare pundit who bothers to do the sums, writes: \"Really big misstatements, it turns out, cannot be effectively challenged because voters can't believe that a man who seems so likeable would do that sort of thing.\" </p> <p>But he would. The drunken driving arrest is not the only character evidence from Bush's past that has been suppressed or glossed over. On October 2, the Center for Public Integrity in Washington and Bill Muntaglio and Nancy Beiles in Talk magazine revealed that Bush not once but repeatedly missed the legal deadlines for reporting his insider stock trades when he was a director and member of the audit committee of a ropey Texas oil company, Harken Energy. In 1991, three years before he ran for governor, the Wall Street Journal headlined one instance when Bush sold near the top of the market before the stock plunged, pocketing nearly $850,000. He was eight months late in reporting this coup. He claimed he had but that the SEC had \"lost the paperwork\". But neither the Journal, or anyone else, has asked Bush if the SEC \"lost the paperwork\" when he was derelict on three other newly-documented insider trades he did not report in the way required by the anti-corruption laws. </p> <p>The 1991 SEC investigation, criticised for being run by friends of then President Bush, ended inconclusively. Bush, it was said, could not have known of the magnitude of Harken's impending loss when he sold out. But the SEC never interviewed Bush and documents obtained last month under the Freedom of Information Act clearly show that Bush had more knowledge than he admitted. At least twice during the month he cashed out, he received memos showing the company was in financial peril. </p> <p>The man who claims the presidency on the grounds of probity has asserted: \"I believe in individual accountability and individual responsibility.\" But the credulous press and the cerebrally challenged television talk shows have been too busy pillorying Gore to ask Bush to reconcile rhetoric and action. \"I will do everything I can,\" he has said, \"to defend the power of private property and private property rights.\" But he has failed to reconcile that public testament with his enrichment from the seizure of private land for his Texas Rangers baseball stadium. Though then a private citizen, he contrived to use the power of the state to claim eminent domain over 270 acres - most of which was not needed for the stadium. Families who lost their land so that Bush and his partners could profit from the development potential are still mad at him for the land-grab and the ordeal of court hearings they had to initiate before getting a fair price. Maree Fanning, who lost the family horse farm, told a reporter: \"If I saw him today, I'd say 'Bite my ass'.\" </p> <p>Tomorrow too many American voters, deprived of the real story, may kiss it. </p> <p> Harold Evans is the author of The American Century</p>",
  "<p>Leading employers' body the CBI last night came under sustained fire from senior ministers and union leaders for demanding an immediate and lasting ban on further employment rights legislation. </p> <p>On the eve of its national conference in Birmingham, the CBI urged the government to drop plans for paid parental leave and measures to enable women to return to work part-time, claiming that 15 separate employment regulations had cost business \u00a312.3bn since Labour came to power three years ago and stifled industry with red tape. </p> <p>Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, and John Monks, TUC general secretary, accused the CBI of using code for an \"attack on decent standards in the workplace\" in its strictures on regulation, with Mr Byers saying he would make no apology for measures such as the minimum wage. </p> <p>Digby Jones, the CBI director-general, and his deputy, John Cridland, went out of their way to insist they were not criticising new employment rights. \"The government has delivered on its manifesto commitments,\" Mr Jones said. \"We are against all the unnecessary red tape that's been brought in around those rights.\" </p> <p>Mr Cridland added: \"There is mounting frustration within the business community about the uncessary pain that goes with laudable gain, particularly for small firms which lack the personnel resources to deal with it.\" </p> <p>They admitted that the bulk of the \u00a312.3bn costs of implementing new workplace rights was to pay for higher wages and shorter working weeks, which had been absorbed by businesses, rather than the extra bureaucracy involved in administering them which has cost only tens of millions. </p> <p>\"We are not even attacking the necessary administration involved - but simply unnecessary red tape,\" Mr Cridland said, claiming it diverted managers from more important functions. But he and Mr Jones insisted that the government should drop plans for any more rights and resist calls for automatic increases in the minimum wage. </p> <p>Ministers plan to launch a green paper before Christmas on paid parental leave, including measures to enable women to return to work part-time, and insist they have already consulted widely with employers. \"This will be a new phase of consultation and we are already aware of the implications for business, especially small firms,\" insiders said. </p> <p>Mr Byers said: \"If the CBI can identify areas of excessive bureaucracy I would be the first to take action to tackle it. But what I am not prepared to do is deny people decent conditions at work.\" </p> <p>He even held out the prospect of a regulatory reform bill in next month's Queen's speech to ensure that regulation is only introduced when absolutely necessary. </p> <p>DTI figures suggest 3m have gained an entitlement to four weeks' paid holiday for the first time while 1.5m stand to benefit from the minimum wage. The TUC said it cost only 9p a week each to introduce equal rights for part-time employees and 2p a week for parents' time off. </p> <p>Mr Monks said employers gained \u00a323bn a year from unpaid overtime and instead of \"moaning\" about red tape, they should work with government and unions to increase productivity and skills. </p> <p>The CBI's attack on red tape came as part of a wider campaign, including a business election manifesto, for lower taxes and regulation. Mr Jones said the extra \u00a35bn taxes a year imposed on business, if added to, would make Britain less attractive for foreign investors and put British firms off investing in plant and training. </p> <p>He said the regulators of privatised industries such as water and rail were becoming \"omnipotent\" and tending to manage their sectors. </p> <p>They should, he said, be more accountable to boards of advisers - \"a lot more we and far less me.\"</p>",
  "A \"brutal\" raid on a model liberal prison which shattered the trust between officials and inmates is set to be fiercely criticised by MPs this week. <p>A report by the Commons home affairs committee into the search of Blantyre House, a resettlement prison boasting a reoffending rate of only 8%, is expected to be scathing.</p> <p>Martin Narey, the director-general of the prison service, who admitted that the raid in May failed to find the amount of contraband which had been suspected, finds his reputation in danger of being tarnished.</p> <p>It is claimed the controversy exposes a rift between those in the prison service who believe no risks should be taken with security and others who think a trust needs to be shown if inmates are to be reformed.</p> <p>The committee's inquiry heard how a team of 86 prison officers, 20 sniffer dogs and two control and restraint squads swooped on the prison near Tunbridge Wells in Kent.</p> <p>During Operation Swinford, doors were prised open and their frames smashed. More than \u00a35,000 of damage was done and when the squad left, the words, \"We woz 'ere\" were found chalked on a blackboard. All 120 inmates were drug-tested, although none proved positive.</p> <p>Alan Roger, a former inmate, said: \"The raid was brutal. It was a fishing expedition. An act of revenge. They want to destroy Blantyre House by stealth.\"</p> <p>A fortnight later Mr Narey told MPs that \"a quite frightening\" amount of contraband was found, including 25 bank cards, passports, driving licences in forged names, and equipment which could have been used in an escape. He also said \"large quantities of money\" were discovered.</p> <p>By the time Mr Narey testified again last month he accepted that the amounts of contraband had been small.</p> <p>An internal prison service document confirmed that the haul amounted to \u00a3370 in cash - of which \u00a3130 belonged to the chaplain - three unauthorised mobile phones, bank cards, cameras, building tools, seven pieces of pornography, a small amount of cannabis and three ecstasy tablets.</p> <p>The bank cards were mainly debit cards, which had been authorised by the governor and used by prisoners who went out to work.</p> <p>A lump hammer and spirit level also found were authorised work tools.</p> <p>There were combative exchanges between MPs and Mr Narey and his south-east area manager, Tom Murtagh.</p> <p>The all-party group of MPs was visibly outraged at the impact on this prison, one of only three \"resettlement\" jails in England and Wales. \"It was thoroughly unjustified and a ghastly mistake,\" complained the Tory MP, Humfrey Malins.</p> <p>All agree, including the prisons minister, Paul Boateng, who was told in advance about the raid, that trust between inmates and prison staff had been \"shattered\".</p> <p>Operation Swinford was ordered soon after Blantyre's long-serving governor, Eoin McLennan-Murray, and his deputy, David Podmore, were told they were being moved, with only two hours' notice, to other jobs in the service.</p> <p>Mr McLennan-Murray and Mr Murtagh fell out when the governor refused to institute searches of prisoners returning from outside work - around half are allowed out. The governor pointed at the exemplary record of Blantyre. There had been no escapes in two-and-a-half years.</p> <p>The chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, described Blantyre's record as \"remarkable\" and thought the raid extraordinary. When Sir David was asked if he thought the search was to look for evidence to use against Mr McLennan-Murray, he replied: \"One presumes that the governor being removed was the main purpose of the exercise.\"</p> <p>Mr Narey said the prison service had been nervous about the possibility of places at the prison being \"bought\" by powerful inmates ever since 1995 when the underworld boss Kenny Noye was involved in an attempt to place a prisoner there as part of a fraud plot.</p> <p>But his credibility with the MPs rested on an \"intelligence\" briefing he gave in private. The indications are that the claims centred on a drug ring in the jail. It was found that the phones had been used to keep in contact with prominent criminals. But the allegations are not thought to have been sufficient to convince MPs to tone down the report.</p>",
  "<p>During 1979 songwriter, performer and artist Daniel Johnston discovered the two great loves that would shape his life. The first was the music of the Beatles, whose influence is apparent in his lyrics and music, the second was a young woman named Laurie. Sadly for the then 18-year-old Johnston, Laurie already had a fiance, a fact that provided him with enough material for over 50 songs. </p> <p>\"My story was really quite dismal,\" says Johnston, speaking of his teenage years. \"I'm a manic depressive and in junior high I had a nervous breakdown and I was really out of it. I discovered the Beatles and man, I was saved. I loved the music and everything about it. I started writing myself.\" The songs he began writing and recording were touching slices of emotion that detailed his rejection by Laurie and chronicled the downward trend in his mental health. His manic depression would lead to numerous hospital stays, which have seen him compared to \"outsiders\" such as Syd Barrett and even Van Gogh. </p> <p>Johnston first came to prominence in the early 1990s with a rash of releases on independent labels, of music he had taped on a cheap cassette recorder during the 1980s. Those who cut through the sound quality found a naive, honest beauty amid the shaky recordings which feature Johnston playing organ or singing in his high-pitched voice over jazz 78s. The songs dealt with his fragile mental state with frankness and a wry, self-deprecating humour. </p> <p>\"Daniel's appeal is obvious: he writes very catchy songs,\" says Irwin Chusid, author of Songs in the Key of Z, an exploration of outsider music which features a chapter on Johnston. \"He's done a lot of studio recording in the past 10 years, and in multi-tracked splendour, the strength of his songs is evident.\" </p> <p>During 1983 Johnston enjoyed his most productive period to date, recording over 100 songs in the garages of family members. But this creative explosion was a symptom of his illness spiralling out of control. His state of mind is neatly summed up in the lyric of Desperate Man Blues: \"I don't feel much like living. Can't see what for.\" The track comes from the tape he was recording as he finally suffered a breakdown. </p> <p>Rather than seek treatment Johnston hit the road, settling a few months later in the Texan capital, Austin. By 1985 he had become a minor celebrity there by handing out his tapes to strangers in the street, or at McDonald's where he was working. He even appeared on an MTV programme about Austin and won a local award for best songwriter. But by the time of his second MTV appearance in December 1986 he was in hospital under heavy medication. </p> <p>Johnston's breakdowns are part of his legend. There have been a litany of incidents, including the time he caused his father to crash-land a small aircraft he was piloting. Johnston became convinced that his father was Satan and tried to take the controls. Once again he was committed to a mental institution. </p> <p>The late 1980s and early 1990s were a particularly difficult time for him, even though he was starting to receive critical acclaim. A trip to New York to record in 1988 resulted in the album 1990, a bleak affair with none of Johnston's trademark humour. The main theme is Satan and Johnston's belief that \"the devil has Texas\". It was a breakdown set to music; some reviewers accused Johnston's label of exploiting his illness to sell records. </p> <p>The 1991 follow up, Artistic Vice, could not have been more different. Another stay in hospital was followed by an outpouring of upbeat material. He was backed for the first time by a full band, a bunch of misfits Johnston had met at a local church in West Virginia, where he was recuperating. Around this time he also recorded a tribute to his hero, John Lennon. </p> <p>Johnston's love for Lennon is nothing, however, compared to the flame he holds for Laurie. His hope that he will eventually be united with Laurie, in this world or the next, has never wavered and at the age of 38 Johnston is still writing about her. Half of the songs on his most recent album, Rejected Unknown, seem to be about her, his hopes of romance having been boosted by her recent divorce. His plan now is to make the big time, because this may enable him to win her heart. </p> <p>\"I started talking to her a little bit on the phone,\" he says. \"As she was no longer married I was very interested in talking to her. But it would be best if I waited until I was rich and famous, if I ever get to be rich and famous.\" </p> <p>Although it seems barely possible that one as awkward as Johnston would hit the big time, he has come close. In 1994 he released Fun on Atlantic records in the US. Their relationship ended after disagreements on working methods and a realisation that an ill Johnston was not easy to market. Johnston was also courted by Elektra but refused to work with them because of his belief that one of the label's other acts, Metallica, were in league with Satan. </p> <p>As the popularity of Johnston's music has blossomed so has appreciation of his childlike art work. He would previously hand out his felt-tip cartoons to friends and fans but has now come to see the value of his visual work and is regularly exhibiting it in the US. Simpsons creator Matt Groening purchased an armful of Johnston's drawings when the pair met. Ever the overgrown teenager, Johnston took the cheque, and Groening, straight to a comic shop. </p> <p>Johnston's drawings reflect the same themes as his music, namely love and rejection, dreams and nightmares, good and evil. They are inhabited by the same cast of cartoon characters who often appear in his songs. Fellow felt-tip artist Graham Dolphin, who is curating Johnston's first London exhibition, became a fan the first time he saw Johnston's art on his record sleeves. \"I liked the way that they were absolutely honest,\" he says. \"He makes totally sincere art.\" </p> <p>Whether Johnston is too sincere to make it big remains to be seen. His health is holding, aided by anti-depressants. His enthusiasm means that he will have plenty of people cheering him on and he doesn't mind too much whether they are laughing with him or at him, as long as they help him towards his goal of stardom, stadiums and getting the girl. \"I'm not really Jerry Lewis but I understand that I'm kind of humorous,\" he says. Fingers crossed.</p>",
  "Buried deep in the stack at the Bodleian library in Oxford, from which it is exhumed on average once every 50 years, lies a forgotten early 18th-century book which is both fascinating and disappointing by turns. A rare volume - and deservedly so - Memoirs of the 20th Century: Being Original Letters of State under George VI was the first ever complete work of futurology. <p>Written around 1730 by a clergyman, Samuel Madden, it opens intriguingly enough, with a letter datelined Constantinople, Nov 3 1997, but sadly goes downhill from that point. Madden's 1997 is dominated by a George VI who is a mighty world emperor, but most of the book's 527 turgid pages are mired in contemporary, 18th-century concerns. </p> <p>A couple of ideas suggest, none the less, that Madden really was thinking systematically about the future. He envisages the establishment of public granaries in all villages - pretty radical stuff, really - and even some prototype women's rights legislation. Thirty years later, another, more ambitious forward-looking book appeared, The Reign of George VI, 1900 to 1925, became a bestseller, and futurology was on its way. </p> <p>This George was also a conquering hero, who tames the nations the anonymous author believed would be the miscreants of the early 20th century: France and Russia. The latter, 25,000 of whose troops sack Durham in a war of 1900, is seen as the world's second most powerful nation by this time, with America close behind. Not bad at all as predictions go. </p> <p>The book wasn't all politics, either. It foresaw the legacy of the canal-building boom, which had just begun, and extrapolated that by 1900, a network of waterways would form a superhighway system, with the effect that \"Villages grew into towns and towns became cities\". Substitute trains for barges and you are looking at a decent stab at what today's multinationals call trend forecasting. </p> <p>The Reign of George VI also envisages a king who hates modern architecture so much that he builds a new English capital city, called Stanley, in Rutland, which he fills with neo-classical buildings and surrounds by artificial mountains. Fanciful, perhaps, but strangely reminiscent of our own heir to the throne's ideal village, twee little Poundberry, in Dorset. </p> <p>Futurologists tend not to get a great press. No wonder Samuel Goldwyn was moved to observe, \"Never predict anything - especially the future\", and Arthur C Clarke, whose 2001 has in so many ways failed to materialise, to comment wryly that, \"The future isn't what it used to be.\" </p> <p>Yet it is arguable that we are far too harsh in smug retrospect on those who attempt to peer round chronological corners. Naturally, when we try to envision the future, we always get trivialities such as the fashions and shape of cars wrong. Those sorts of visual cues are decided on a whim rather than a response to need. But most futurological predictions I have come across are almost spookily prescient in more significant respects. Take this extraordinary forecast, made in 1661-70 years before Samuel Madden - in a scientific treatise by the philosopher Joseph Glanvill, a clergyman and chaplain to Charles II, and a founder member of the Royal Society. \"To them that come after us,\" Glanvill wrote, \"It may be as ordinary to buy a pair of wings to fly to the remotest regions, as now a pair of boots to ride a journey; and to confer at the distance of the Indies by sympathetic conveyances, may be as usual in the future as by literary correspondence . . . I doubt not posterity will find many things that are now rumours verified into practical realities. It may be that, some ages hence, a voyage to the Southern tracts, yea possibly to the Moon, will not be more strange than one to America . . . the restoration of grey hairs to juvenility and the renewing of the exhausted marrow may at length be elicited without a miracle; and the turning of the now comparatively desert world into a paradise may not improbably be effected from late agriculture.\" </p> <p>By the late-Victorian era, futurology was becoming really quite slick. Jules Verne described, for example, how musical recitals would by 2000 be sent down a wire from the artist to pianos around the world. Well, MP3 music on the internet hasn't worked out quite like that, but it's hardly dissimilar. </p> <p>An American journalist, David Goodman Croly, writing in 1888 as Sir Oracle, predicted for the coming new century: \"Women throughout the world will enjoy increased opportunities and privileges. Along with this new freedom will come social tolerance of sexual conduct formerly condoned only in men. In addition, because of the greater availability of jobs, more women will choose not to have children.\" </p> <p>Twelve years later, another journalist, John Elfreth Watkins, having interviewed \"the wisest and most careful men in our greatest institutions of science and learning\" on behalf of The Ladies' Home Journal made a brilliant series of consumer predictions. The future, Watkins reported, would witness air-conditioning, international telephones, colour photography, frozen meals, medicine taken through skin patches, snowmobiles, the tapping of energy from wind, tides and sunlight - and out-of-season fruit. </p> <p>Most amazing of all, perhaps, was Watkins's prophecy that, \"Persons and things of all kinds will be brought within focus of cameras connected electrically with screens at opposite end of circuits, thousands of miles at a span.\" </p> <p>John Maynard Keynes, also writing at the end of the 19th century, even prophesied e-commerce: \"The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages.\" (Modern web shoppers will applaud Keynes's foresight, but regret that the \"delivery upon the doorstep\" part has yet to be sorted out.) </p> <p>Oddly enough, the would-be seers who consistently get the future wrong are specialists in their field, the media's beloved \"experts\", whose futurological track record isn't nearly as good as that of those whose approach is that of the generalist (aka, inspired guessing). </p> <p>The first expert futurologist was probably the Dorking vicar and demographer, Thomas Malthus, who in 1798 anonymously wrote a sensational pamphlet sounding the alarm on overpopulation. People had been complaining of overpopulation since Horace in 20BC, but Malthus was so convinced humanity would run out of space within a few years that he favoured effectively culling the working class, for which he was later derided by Karl Marx as \"a miserable parson\". </p> <p>Two hundred years on, Malthus still has his fans, and the fashion for apocalyptic forecasting grows apace. In 1964, a British physicist, John Fremlin, speculated in New Scientist on population trends for the coming 1,000 years, and argued that by the middle of the 29th century, 60,000 trillion people, a million times today's population, would spend their lives lying prone and eating recycled human bodies in cubicles in 2,000 storey buildings spread across both land and what had been sea. </p> <p>The apocalyptic certainty of choice today, of course, is global warming, which if its advocates are right, would be the profoundest ever future prediction. It is worth noting, however, that just a couple of decades ago, many of the same experts were confidently predicting global cooling , and a new ice age. \"A new ice age must now stand alongside a nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale misery and death,\" said International Wildlife magazine in 1975. The next year, Science magazine reported that we were \"heading for extensive northern hemisphere glaciation.\" </p> <p>Even experts proferring non-apocalyptic futurology have been hugely and entertainingly wrong over the years. The Nobel prize winning physicist, Ernest Rutherford, the founder of nuclear physics, once declared that talk of nuclear power was \"moonshine\". Britain's astronomer royal, Sir Harold Spencer Jones, dismissed the idea of space flight as \"bunk\" in 1957 - a fortnight before the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1. </p> <p>And then there was Thomas J Watson, the former CEO of IBM, who never quite lived down a statement he made in the late 1940s: \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\" (Perhaps he really meant five computers per household.) No wonder that, in another of his dictums, Arthur C Clarke said that \"when a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right, but when he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.\" </p> <p>So what predictions for the next century would I make, having interviewed dozens of both expert and generalist futurologists, and explored the pitfalls and triumphs of past futurology? Well, I can't see the old favourite, household robots, ever taking off - another massive instruction book to read, another machine to drive us mad with software seizures. </p> <p>It is hard, similarly, to see artificial, computer intelligence being much of a starter, although it's promised for as early as 2015. Even if it could be achieved (which human brain experts are very sceptical of, pointing out that our most powerful computer currently has the intellect of an earthworm) there would, surely, be no market for computers which, when given a boring job, told you to do it your damned self. </p> <p>We like computers, surely, for their artificial stupidity . And if they get too clever, won't they soon start complaining of cruelty? (You laugh, but cruelty to computers is said to be close to becoming a social issue, and is already being discussed by acade mics specialising in human rights.) </p> <p>Genetic engineering will, I strongly suspect, also fail to deliver a fraction of what its advocates promise. There will be endless cases reported in the press around 2025 of people who supposedly had the \"criminal gene\" edited out of their DNA, and subsequently been convicted of car theft. Likewise, parents who paid to have the \"gay gene\" excised (probably illegally) from their children's make-up and ended up disappointed by the result will be locked in litigation with the clinics who did the genetic work. </p> <p>Time travel, I can't see happening either. It took the great Stephen Hawking to point out the obvious objection - that if it were possible, surely we would have seen tourists from the future by now? Quantum teleportation a la Star Trek is said to be a possibility, however. But whether a teleported human will arrive at his destination complete with his mind and memory intact will be an interesting one to watch. </p> <p>Medical advances, meanwhile, may well soon make death a lifestyle option rather than an inevitability, and this could have extraordinary repercussions. If you take the view, for example, that religion has only existed for the past few thousand years because of our fear of death, could the prospect of eternal life finally destroy religion once and for all? And could that, in turn, lead to an overwhelmingly amoral society? </p> <p>Space travel - and the eventual colonisation of other planets is probably inevitable if we all live for hundreds of years - may throw up some interesting conundrums too. For what will be tax position of the colonists? The first generation living on another planet may feel allegiance to the country that paid for their trip and the building of their base. But thereafter, it seems probable that Mars-born humans who only know Earth as a dot in the night sky, might resist attempts to tax them. Maybe there will be a space repeat of the 1773 Boston tea party? </p> <p>One thing is certain for the future. Just as we fervently believe we are living in a special time, and are a special generation witnessing a huge turning point in human affairs - so will our grandchildren and their grandchildren. Every generation thinks the same, and they're always just a little bit wrong. </p> <p>\u0095 A Brief History of Tomorrow: The Future, Past and Present, by Jonathan Margolis, is published by Bloomsbury, priced \u00a314.99</p>",
  "<p>1. Sorry, it's a secret </p> <p>For US drama series, identifying the characters actors play is taboo: titles typically unroll with the star's name (Sarah Michelle Gellar, say, or Dennis Franz) accompanied by a montage of images of the character in action, but with the crucial information frustratingly withheld. Result: you spend most of the first episode trying to puzzle out who all these people are. </p> <p><strong> 2. Yup, still a secret</strong> </p> <p>Also de rigueur in American imports is a second wave of actors' names, arriving (after the big-impact opening) at any time from 10-20 minutes in. Just as unhelpfully, they typically list all non-regular performers, with no distinction between starring roles and barman with a single line. </p> <p><strong> 3. It's the last episode, stupid</strong> </p> <p>No American trend can be ignored, so British drama now routinely opens with a recap of the previous episode, thereby implicitly insulting the intelligence of viewers capable of remembering what they watched seven days ago. And cutting into the time writers get for new stuff. </p> <p><strong> 4. It's the next episode, stupid</strong> </p> <p>Equally obligatory is a 'precap' enticing viewers to watch the same show next week (but how will you remember, if you need reminding what happened?) by zipping through the key action. As with movie trailers, though, you might easily feel you've already seen all the best bits. </p> <p><strong> 5. Just hysterical luvvies and grumpy blokes in Barbours</strong> </p> <p>Credits are an annoying obligation for broadcasters, using time that could be devoted to ads or trailers. So why not make that clear by sulkily racing through them as fast as possible? </p> <p><strong> 6. Can you spot the credits, children?</strong> </p> <p>The even more insulting solution: cramping the unrolling credits into tiny letters in a corner of the screen, while an announcer flogs the video/ spin-off book/magazine that occupies the rest. </p> <p><strong> 7. Producing assistant to the acting assistant co-producer (Portugal)</strong> </p> <p>What do all these 'producers' do? The simplest indy doc or drama now typically involves two from the production company, two more from the broadcaster, and a fifth from the foreign co-producer; a Frasier or an ER can require between 8-15, with baroque variations of nomenclature. </p> <p><strong> 8. Hey, I signed the cheques</strong> </p> <p>Heads of originating departments invariably insist on a credit as 'executive producer', whether their actual role consisted of overseeing the project from the outset, visiting the set once to schmooze with the stars, or merely inheriting someone else's work. There's an upside: you know who to blame for bummers. </p> <p><strong> 9. Anything she wants, OK?</strong> </p> <p>It started on movies, but now it's on telly, it's the \"personal assistant to Ms Pfeiffer\" credit. Does it really matter who did their hair? These look suspiciously like vanity credits, awarded to pamper big egos. </p> <p><strong> 10. Music? What music?</strong> </p> <p>Although most TV drama now uses pop songs - a trend started by Cold Feet - BBC policy still stubbornly resists identifying any music. So, crazily, the lowliest member of the film crew gets a name check, but not the snatch of Monteverdi or Moby which sets the mood of the entire piece. Hence all those surprisingly un-angry 'could you settle an argument?' letters to Radio Times. John Dugdale</p>",
  "If this is Sunday, it must be Philadelphia. Or Michigan. Or Iowa. His eyes almost closed from exhaustion, his voice sometimes cracking and his trademark plea of \"I need your help\" sounding more and more heart-felt, Al Gore is squeezing every last moment from the day and the night as he swings one last time through the states that could go either way. <p>It falls to the Rev Albert Campbell, pastor of the Mount Carmel Baptist church in the black area of West Philadelphia, to make the early morning introduction of the vice-president after invoking an even higher authority. </p> <p>\"Work your will, Lord, this election time,\" Mr Campbell implores as he stands before one of the city's finest gospel choirs, \"because what we do, dear God, has impact on all the world\". </p> <p>Al Gore, looking just like a man who has had to exist on between two and five hours' sleep a night and big doses of coffee and political adrenaline, takes up the religious theme in the packed church by telling the congregation that \"the day and is drawing nigh, the one day every four years when the people have the power\". He reminds them of the words of St Paul to the Galatians: \"Be not weary in well doing.\" </p> <p>Weary in every other respect, the Democratic party's presidential candidate has subjected himself to this desperately punishing schedule buoyed by a late feeling in his team that victory is still within his grasp if he can but claim the \"toss-up states\". </p> <p>Nowhere is closer than Pennsylvania, where the latest local opinion survey shows Mr Gore at 43% compared to 42% for his Republican opponent, George W Bush, and 8% for the Green party standard-bearer, Ralph Nader. </p> <p>With its 23 votes in the electoral college - the body reflecting the popular vote in each state which then elects the president - Pennsylvania could even swing the result. That is why its biggest city is playing host this Sunday to three Gorerallies. </p> <p>This last weekend started in Aimes, Iowa, on Friday. By the time Air Force II touched down in the early evening drought-breaking rain at Memphis airport that night, Mr Gore had already delivered his standard speech in three states. The visit to his home state of Tennessee should not have been necessary, but the polls have put Mr Bush just ahead there. </p> <p>The vice-president has become more expansive with the travelling press since the summer, but his message now is very much over the heads of the media and towards the great undecided. </p> <p>The crowd of around 2,000 in Court Square in downtown Memphis has been serenaded by no less then the Rev Al Green, Preston Shannon and Ruby Wilson, the cream of soul and rhythm and blues here. </p> <p>Wilson refers to Al Gore as our \"homeboy\" although homeboy may not be the first - or even the 101st - description that springs to mind when the vice-president bounds on stage with his wife Tipper and his daughter Kristin, a comedy script writer in Los Angeles. </p> <p>Memphis is a predominantly black town and that is reflected in the crowd. The rally has been arranged at speed - campaign headquarters in every swing state have been put on alert for a visit. </p> <p>The Team Tennessee youngsters working for Mr Gore and his running mate Joseph Lieberman have to make sure that the placards - tonight they say \"Tipper Rocks\", whatever that means - are handed out to willing hands to wave when the camera lights hit them. </p> <p>Mr Gore's voice has started to go - it cracks a couple of times during a speech delivered jacketless despite the damp. He finishes with the standard: \"I may not be the most exciting politician in the world - like Willie Herenton [the dashing local mayor] - but I will work for you each day and I will fight for you with all my heart.\" </p> <p>The Gore team is deliberately making no comment on the drink-driving story that has emerged from Mr Bush's distant past, but privately there is much glee, not least because of the Bush TV commercial beaming out in Tennessee tonight, which has him saying: \"I believe we need to encourage personal responsibility so people are accountable for their own actions.\" </p> <p>There's not much sleep in these final hours. Mr Gore will get between the sheets too late even to see Madonna endorsing him on Dave Letterman's Late Show: \"I'm a chick so who [else] would I vote for?\" </p> <p>Grey dawn Saturday, and a prayer meeting at the Peabody Hotel, Memphis. Then the motorcade takes Mr Gore out of his home state, his campaign here possibly concluded. He may not returns until he casts his vote in Carthage tomorrow. </p> <p>The motorcade blue-lights its way to the airport for a flight to Huntington, West Virginia. Here a small rally has supporters arranged strategically behind the vice-president nodding and smiling like loyal bankbenchers during televised question time in the House of Commons. </p> <p>Then there is the private trip to watch Al Junior playing football for his high school team in Washington, and finally on to chilly Pittsburgh. \"It ain't really cold, it just acts that way,\" the bearded airport employee tells the shivering arrivals. \"You've all been down in the South too long.\" </p> <p>The Wesley Centre African Methodist Episcopalian Zion church is the first stop here and has honoured Mr Gore with another stellar gospel choir singing Blessed Lord and O Happy Day as he arrives almost dead on time. </p> <p>If this race was decided on who has the best musical accompaniment Mr Gore would win by a landslide. Mr Bush's best shot so far seems to have been Hank Williams Jr: those heirs to famous names must stick together. </p> <p>The clear strategy in these last few days is no longer just to deliver the message, for everyone in these churches is converted, but to get people to persuade everyone they know to vote. Mr Gore presses the buttons again: affirmative action, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, the tragedy of Africa's Tutsis and the Hutus, the need for hate-crime legislation, his boyhood horror at seeing rings for tying up slaves in a mansion on the hill in Carthage, the threat to civil rights if Mr Bush is elected and appoints conservative judges to the supreme court. </p> <p>The last rally of Saturday is with another solid Democratic sector, the unions. They have organised a bash in Pittsburgh's Hot Metal Street. Here the audience is much whiter, big men from this old steel city in baseball caps and jackets, promising to get out the vote on the day. </p> <p>This is not so much a marathon as a steeplechase, vaulting the time and weather zones and plunging through the cold water of public scepticism. The finishing post is in sight. But first it's off to Fairmount park in the heart of the city of Brotherly Love on this glorious autumn day. </p> <p>On the whole, WC Fields said in his famous epitaph, I'd rather be in Philadelphia. On the whole, Al Gore would rather be anywhere than buried by George W Bush.So, one more time, the voice cracking: \"I will fight for you! I need your help!\" as Air Force II prepares to take off for the last destination of the day, a place in Iowa called Waterloo.</p>",
  "<p>The floods posed a fresh hazard last night when it emerged that the rising waters of the Severn were threatening a chemical plant. </p> <p>Firefighters in protective suits were checking safety at the Cleansing Services Group plant at Sandhurst, near Gloucester, where last week six people were taken to hospital after an explosion and fire. </p> <p>About 50 villagers were evacuated afterwards and dozens have since complained of stinging faces, sore throats and stomach pains.

When the cameras are gone I want the pressure still there to help.\" </p> <p>He criticised insurance companies following reports that some were demanding inflated premiums or rejecting applications altogether. </p> <p>The government will urge insurers to scrap rules requiring claimants to restore flooded homes to their previous condition, even if the old design, such as wooden floors, did not represent the best protection from further floods. </p> <p>\"I have received a lot of complaints about how slow they are dealing with claims and sometimes the work is not of a good quality,\" Mr Prescott said. </p> <p>Insurers warned yesterday that repeatedly flooded homes could become uninsurable. </p> <p>House prices could fall by as much as 25% in areas where the risk of flooding is highest. Once-desirable riverside properties have taken a knock in value, while homes in flood-devastated areas have been taken off the market. </p> <p>The Law Society will announce early next year that solicitors must include any \"environmental risk\" to a property - particularly flooding - when checking a house. </p> <p>The society has been liaising with the environment agency, which from next month will make flood risk information available to the public on its website, on a postcode basis. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"We have been working to produce an improved property search making a number of environmental questions standard. </p> <p>\"At the moment flood risk isn't routinely checked for in property searches by solicitors.\" </p> <p>The government is to change planning guidance for local authorities, making it easier to reject applications to build on land liable to flooding. </p> <p>Andrew Bennett, the Labour chairman of the environment select committee, claimed the government's housing policies were partly responsible for the flooding. </p> <p>He said the vast extension of house building meant water drained off the land into rivers far more quickly, increasing the likelihood of flooding. </p> <p>A 13-year-old boy died on Saturday after slipping on rain-sodden cliffs and plunging 60 feet onto rocks at Sharkham Point, near Brixham, South Devon. </p> <p>Although the weather was good at the time of the accident, the cliff tops were muddy and slippery after days of torrential rain and the rocks were treacherous.</p>",

  "Stephanie Lawrence, who has died suddenly at the age of 50, was a musical actress of rare glamour, which made her natural casting for a show about Marilyn Monroe. But, although she was a pillar of British musical theatre over the past 20 years and played lead roles in Cats, Evita, Starlight Express and Blood Brothers, she never fully achieved the 40-carat stardom that came to her no-more talented peers. <p>She was born in Hayling Island, Hampshire, into a performing background. Her father was a musician and her mother, Gladys Kent, was a classically trained dancer who later formed a children's dance troupe, the Kent Babes. The young Stephanie went to the Arts Educational School in Hertfordshire and made her West End debut as a roller-skating tap-dancer in Peter Nichols's Forget-Me-Not Lane (1971): a prophetic move since she spent a good part of her later musical career on skates. </p> <p>It was hard to miss her in the Nichols play since she embodied the adolescent sexual fantasies of the play's autobiographical hero. </p> <p>Her stunning looks were accompanied by a fine voice and a dedicated professionalism and it was no surprise when she took over the lead role in Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's Evita in 1981 and made no less an impression than Elaine Page as the Argentinian icon. </p> <p>The choreographer on that show, Larry Fuller, was also the director of a musical called Marilyn which opened two years later at the Adelphi Theatre. The show was intended as a tribute to another popular icon who died young, but it failed to capture the public imagination. The one person who emerged with credit was Stephanie Lawrence. She not only captured the externals of Marilyn Monroe - the wiggle, the walk, the passionate pout, the vocal breathiness - but conveyed the carmined innocence and soft vulnerability within. It should have been her passport to fame but the show failed to live up to its star. </p> <p>Undaunted, she picked herself up and got on with it. In 1983 she played the reformed prostitute, Mary Magdalene, in an ITV play called Doubting Thomas. In 1984, she was back on roller-skates in Lloyd Webber's Starlight Express at the Apollo Victoria Theatre. Amid the hi-tech efficiency of Trevor Nunn's over-busy production, she once again caught the eye. As I wrote in my review: \"The first number to really grab me was He Whistled At Me which worked because Stephanie Lawrence, as a pink-suited steam-buff, was allowed to stand centre-stage and communicate a recognisable human emotion: unfulfilled longing.\" </p> <p>Lawrence remained a popular figure on the musical scene. Succeeding Barbara Dickson and Angela Richards, she spent four years in Willy Russell's Blood Brothers. As well as appearing at the Phoenix Theatre, she also led the cast of the company that took the production to New York in 1993 where, thanks to the determination of producer Bill Kenwright, it survived mixed reviews. </p> <p>She was a renowned animal lover and someone who put her career before long-term relationships although she married Laurie Sautereau only this year. She also brought to the West End musical stage a luminous glamour that has been extinguished cruelly early. </p> <p>\u0095 Stephanie Lawrence, actress, born December 16 1949; died November 4 2000.</p>",
  "An investigation began last night into why a man under arrest for holding a bus full of Japanese tourists hostage in Greece was able to hurl himself to death from the seventh floor of a police station in Athens. <p>\"This was an unlucky moment for the Greek police, especially after the successful operation to safeguard the lives of the hostages,\" the general secretary of the public order ministry, Dimitris Efstathiadis, said. </p> <p>But a conservative opposition MP, Fani Palli-Petralia, demanded further clarification, saying: \"There is a big question marking hanging over this incident.\" </p> <p>The hijacker, Christos Kendiras, in his late 40s, dived through a window at the central Athens police headquarters as he was being prepared for transfer to a public prosecutor in Piraeus, ending a bizarre two-day drama of murder and hostage-taking, some of which was broadcast live on television. </p> <p>He bolted when his handcuffs were removed for him to be fingerprinted and photographed, ran into a nearby office and jumped through a window, the police said. He died when he hit a concrete overhang above the station's main entrance. </p> <p>Kendiras threatened to kill himself while he held 35 people, mainly elderly Japanese tourists, at gunpoint for nine hours on Saturday. </p> <p>He faced charges of killing his mother-in-law and a man he suspected of having an affair with his wife in his home town, Galatas. <br>Reuters</p>",
  "<p>The Ministry of Defence is to flatten two hills and cut down 150 acres of environmentally sensitive woods so it can sell an historic airfield for use by private executive jets. </p> <p>The MoD is using crown immunity to avoid seeking planning permission to make the airfield at Farnborough, famous for its international air show, attractive to a potential buyer. </p> <p>The airfield is being sold off as surplus to military requirements. But is not thought safe enough by the civil aviation authority unless the hills and trees are removed from the flight path. </p> <p>Local environment groups are alarmed because the area contains sites of special scientific interest, home to some of Britain's rarest birds - the nightjar, dartford warbler and woodlark - although the MoD said the site would be improved by its works. </p> <p>The MoD has already sold a former research station at the airfield for \u00a357m for the area to be used as a science park but has negotiated a much larger sale with the multi-national company TAG Aviation for the airfield itself. This sale, for an undisclosed sum of more than \u00a3100m, was on condition that the CAA was prepared to grant a licence for its use as an airport for executive jets. </p> <p>TAG is investing an additional \u00a380m in new airport buildings while the MoD demolishes the nearby Eelmoor and Miles hills. The sale of a 99-year lease on the airfield is expected to be finalised in 2002. </p> <p>Rick Kimber, spokesman for the Blackwater Valley Friends of the Earth, said that in addition to rare birds, the site contains a number of spiders and beetles which are endangered as well as grass snakes and lizards which are becoming increasingly rare. </p> <p>\"This kind of activity by the MoD shows why we need a countryside and rights of way bill. Under the new legislation the MoD would not be able to get away with this sort of behaviour. They realise that if they had to apply for planning permission they would have a lot of trouble persuading people that destroying the habitat of these species was necessary.\" </p> <p>One hill is losing seven metres (21 feet) and the second two metres, and Mr Kimber claimed a third small rise called Norris hill was also \"being scalped\" as part of a plan to flatten out the whole area. The 50,000 cubic metres of earth being moved will be dumped in the natural hollows between the hills. </p> <p>In 1996 the MoD decided it no longer needed the establishment and began the search for a buyer. One condition of the sale is that the biennial air show, which is used to sell civil and military aircaft, should continue. </p> <p>Keith Holland, chief planning officer for Rushmoor council, said it supported the MoD's wish to sell off the airport for use of executive jets and TAG was granted outline planning permission last month. </p> <p>The MoD allows executive jets to use the airport along side military aircraft but under the plan, permitted aircraft movements would double to a maximum of 28,000 a year. </p> <p>\"Clearly the MoD is entitled to go ahead without planning permission for its works to make flights safer. They did ask us if there were any objections as they are obliged to do. We consulted various bodies and there were no objections so they are going ahead.\" </p> <p>Katherine Chatters, for English Nature, the government's statutory watchdog, said she had not objected because if the work was carried out properly the removal of scrub and trees would restore the site to lowland heath which would provide improved habitat. </p> <p>An MoD spokesman said that the decision to \"remodel\" the hills and cut the trees down was taken on safety grounds for military and civilian aircraft and was not made specifically to satisfy the CAA and facilitate the sale to TAG Aviation.</p>",
  "The Italian government has tried to shore up its constitutional authority by blocking a referendum in Veneto, the region that includes Venice, on greater independence from Rome. <p>The president of Veneto, Giancarlo Galan, vowed to press ahead with the referendum on the constitution that the wealthy region proposed last week, a draft which some described as near secession. </p> <p>Mr Galan, who belongs to the centre-right coalition which is expected to win next year's general election, wants to keep two-thirds of the tax revenues raised in Veneto and to control health, education, immigration, law and order, and elements of foreign policy. </p> <p>Francesco Rutelli, the centre-left's candidate for prime minister, denounced the plan as a recipe for a Yugoslavian-type disintegration. </p> <p>A cabinet meeting decided that a referendum could be called only by the central government. </p> <p>It would interfere with the devolution bill which it aims to push through the senate this week.</p>",
  "Iraqi Airways, grounded since the Gulf war, resumed regular domestic flights through the western-imposed no-fly zones yesterday, striking a further psychological blow against British-backed sanctions. <p>Two Russian-built aircraft took off from Saddam International airport in Baghdad for Basra, in the southern no-fly zone, and Mosul, in the northern zone. </p> <p>An Iraqi official said the airline had started with one flight a week to each destination by plane, but added that there would be extra flights by helicopter. </p> <p>The US and Britain imposed the no-fly zones in 1991 to protect Kurds in the north and Shia Muslims in the south from possible attack by Iraqi forces. Since then, both countries have led Iraq to believe that the ban on flights extended to civilian as well as military aircraft. </p> <p>As recently as last September, when the Guardian disclosed Iraq's plans for a resumption of civilian flights, western diplomatic sources maintained they would be an infringement of the zones. Britain and the US now say that they have no objection to the flights. </p> <p>Saddam's decision to resume domestic flights comes as the whole policy of sanctions is under unprecedented pressure. Although commercial flights to and from Iraq are still forbidden, thinly disguised \"humanitarian\" flights are now almost routine. One day last week, seven arrived from Turkey, Lebanon, Russia and the United Arab Emirates, all carrying officials and business delegations. </p> <p>In addition, high oil prices mean that Iraq now has more money to spend than at any time since the 1991 war. A total of 1,554 companies from 45 countries have sent delegations to the Baghdad trade fair, which continues until Friday. The biggest delegations are from France, Russia and China - all permanent members of the UN security council. </p> <p>A Ministry of Defence spokesman said that the RAF would continue to enforce the no-fly zones, but \"if civil aircraft are flying in them it will be a factor we will take into account\". </p> <p>The US state department has said that, for safety reasons, it wants at least 48 hours' advance notice from Baghdad for each flight. But Iraqi officials refuse to give a warning because that would imply recognition of the no-fly zones. </p> <p>This means that western aircraft patrolling the zones will have to rely on their own \"friend or foe\" technology to distinguish between civilian and military flights. According to one military expert, these methods are not infallible. </p> <p>A further complication is that at least one of yesterday's civilian flights reportedly used a military aircraft. </p> <p>With Britain and the US already under pressure over Iraq's allegations of civilian casualties caused by bombing in the no-fly zones, the accidental shooting down of a passenger aircraft would be a disaster for western policy. </p> <p>Britain is also concerned about plans to reopen the oil pipeline between Iraq and Syria later this month. Diplomats say that Iraq intends illegally to export 200,000 barrels of oil a day through the pipeline, more than doubling the volume of the country's illegal oil sales. </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said the proposed exports to Syria would deprive ordinary Iraqis of humanitarian support if they were conducted outside the UN oil-for-food programme.</p>",
  "You argue that the Patten report should be implemented \"neat\" (Leaders, November 4), asserting that the inquiry was a \"fair-minded study\". How fair-minded is a matter of opinion. What is not in doubt is that if Patten is implemented neat, that will be unacceptable to the great majority of the unionist community and will give further ammunition to the anti-agreement faction of the Ulster Unionist party at the party's council in January. <p>Even assuming the British government could coerce unionists into accepting Patten undiluted, it would inevitably lead to the downfall of David Trimble, the leader of moderate unionism. Unless there is some give on the republican side, the Belfast agreement is doomed. In which case, since there will be no northern ministers, no north-south council nor a Council of the Isles, there will be no prospects of a united Ireland, the goal of republicans. <br><b>Simon Partridge</b><br> London</p>",
  "The chancellor Gordon Brown will this week hand out billions of pounds in his pre-budget statement in an attempt to quell growing popular discontent over fuel prices, pensions and the rising tax burden. <p>In what has been described as the most delicate political judgment of his career, Mr Brown will offer a number of concessions in an effort to remove the increasing perception of arrogance and incompetence surrounding the government. </p> <p>He will hope to assuage some public anger over high fuel prices by targeting tax cuts for low and middle income families. And he will also give away millions to homebuyers willing to move into deprived inner city areas by announcing the targeted scrapping of stamp duty. </p> <p>Mr Brown's statement on Wednesday has been designed to counteract Tory plans to reduce income tax. He hopes to define the election battleground, pledging to increase the value of the new children's tax credit and making the working families tax credit - the tax break for the working poor - more generous. </p> <p>Although there are expected to be some concessions to hauliers and farmers, who have been pressing for huge cuts in fuel tax, the help offered is unlikely to be on anything like the scale demanded. </p> <p>In a speech to the CBI today Mr Brown will insist that the planned concessions will not require plundering his budget surplus, so jeopardising his overall economic strategy. </p> <p>\"Even when tested by events like rising oil prices, our resolve will be constant,\" the chancellor will say. </p> <p>The prime minister Tony Blair highlighted the dilemma, saying yesterday that he could easily win a reputation for listening, but lose his reputation for economic competence if the government gave in to the fuel protesters' demands. </p> <p>However, in the first clear sign that the road haulage industry will gain some respite, Lord MacDonald, the transport minister, said the chancellor will do what he can to ease pressures on the industry. </p> <p>He conceded that British industry was facing growing competition from foreign hauliers. The likely solution is the so-called Britdisc, a tax to be paid by all hauliers, including foreigners, operating inthe UK. However, British hauliers would be compensated for the cost of the disc through parallel cuts in Vehicle Excise Duty. </p> <p>The package is also likely to include help for rural petrol stations. </p> <p>The official haulage industry associations are still pinning their hopes on a 15p cut in diesel duty for hauliers - costing \u00a31.5bn. A refusal to cut diesel duty for hauliers could reunite a politically fractured industry by pushing the more moderate association leaders into the hands of the rank and file protestors. </p> <p>But the associations concede that ministers, previously reluctant to make the politically difficult environmental case for high fuel duty, have been emboldened by claims that floods hitting large swaths of Britain have been caused by global warming. </p> <p>In a sign that the protesters recognise their position is weakening, they have slashed their demand for a 26p cut in general fuel duty down to 12p. Brynle Williams, the more moderate figure in the People's Fuel Lobby, may make further \"negotiating concessions\" when he meets Lord Macdonald today. Popular support for further protests over fuel has fallen to 58%, in line with Labour's private polls. </p> <p>The protesters also issued a statement promising not to stage a go-slow down the motorway if they go ahead with plans for a convoy from Jarrow to London next week. </p> <p>The move came after Lord Macdonald predicted that police would arrest anyone breaching the Highways Act. </p> <p>The shadow environment secretary Archie Norman also spurned disruptive tactics, saying he did not wish the convoy to take place. \"We're saying don't do anything which is going to inconvenience the general public, which is going to break the law.\" </p> <p>In a move designed to underline the competing pressures on the Treasury, Mr Brown is expected to meet Lady Castle on Tuesday following a pensioners' rally in London. </p> <p>Treasury sources promised that there would be above inflation increases in the basic state pension as well as other transitional arrangements before the introduction of the new pensioner credit in three years time. </p> <p>Although attention in advance of the announcement has focused on the fuel protests, the chancellor's themes will be encouraging entrepreneurship, safeguarding the environment and reducing poverty.</p>",
  "<p>It was only ever a matter of time before scientists pointed to one of the toxic agrochemicals pervading the world and linked it to a major disease of unknown cause. </p> <p>Today, Professor Tim Greenamyre, of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, will do just that - suggesting at a conference in the US that exposure to rotenone could cause Parkinson's disease, the crippling brain illness which brings suffering to 120,000 Britons. </p> <p>But, ironically, it is a connection that will shake some of the most ardent opponents of the use of synthetic pesticides in farming. For rotenone is no post-war insect killer cooked up in a corporate lab, but a natural product, extracted from the derris plant, and a mainstay of organic farms and gardens. </p> <p>The findings of Prof Greenamyre and his team, to be published next month in the journal Nature Neuroscience, show that rats repeatedly given rotenone not only develop the symptoms of Parkinson's - trembling and loss of muscle control - but acquire the distinctive microscopic lumps in the brain, known as Lewy bodies, that are a sure sign of the disease. </p> <p>\"These results,\" the scientists write, \"indicate that chronic exposure to a common pesticide can reproduce the anatomical, neurochemical, behavioural and neuropathological features of Parkinson's disease.\" </p> <p>A link between pesticides and Parkinson's, which affects the Pope, Michael J Fox and Muhammad Ali, has been suspected for some time. </p> <p>A review of 19 different studies over the past decade, carried out at the Ohio Medical College last year, reported that most found exposure to pesticides increased the risk of contracting Parkinson's. </p> <p>Critics of the pesticide theory point out that the mass use of man-made chemicals to control pests only began in the latter half of the last century, whereas James Parkinson first identified the symptoms of what he called \"the shaking palsy\" back in 1817, and there is evidence that the disease goes back much further. </p> <p>But rotenone, in the form of the powdered root of the derris plant, was used on a large scale in the industrial world from the mid-19th century onwards. In some countries, it has an even longer history. </p> <p>Derris-based pesticides are on sale in garden centres across Britain. Rotenone is sometimes used to control populations of fish, for which it is highly toxic. </p> <p>One bottle of rotenone pesticide on the shelf of a garden shop yesterday was labelled as \"a traditional insecticide\" and \"a natural plant extract.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday: \"It's too early to say what the safety implications of this study might be. It will be put forward to our pesticide safety directorate toxicologists who will decide whether a review of this particular pesticide needs to take place.\" </p> <p>Although the Atlanta scientists have pinpointed rotenone, they make it clear that they believe other pesticides which work in the same way could be equally dangerous. </p> <p>Benoit Gaisson and Virginia Lee, Parkinson's researchers at Pennsylvania University, said the work did raise questions about rotenone's safety. </p> <p>\"Rotenone is a naturally occurring substance that is eventually degraded in the environment, and as such it is considered to be benign compared to many other pesticides,\" they wrote in Nature Neuroscience. \"Whether rotenone exposure contributes to the incidence of Parkinson's disease remains to be determined. Nevertheless, the effects of chronic rotenone administration observed here may be representative of the possible effects of exposure to low amounts of other environmental toxins, yet to be identified.\" </p> <p>One theory is that exposure to one or several pesticides combines with an individual's genetic makeup to cause Parkinson's. The Pennsylvania researchers said the fact that the risk of getting Parkinson's rose sharply with age fitted in with the notion of the drip-drip effect of environmental toxins over time. </p> <p>In Parkinson's, cells in the brain that produce dopamine, which carries signals between nerve cells, begin to die. The reasons are not understood, but a major clue came in the 1980s, when an attempt to create an illegal designer drug went spectacularly wrong. The guinea pigs who took the drug, MPTP, were struck down with a rapid-onset version of Parkinson's. </p> <p>MPTP interfered with a key component of the dopamine-producing brain cells, the mitochondria, the \"power stations\" of cells. Rotenone and other pesticides have a similar effect, although rotenone appears to produce symptoms much closer to typical Parkinson's disease than MPTP. </p> <p>The Atlanta team believes that at the heart of the problem lies a kind of toxic waste produced by the mitrochondria as they generate energy. This waste comes in the form of rogue molecules called free radicals, which barge around the body, damaging vital functions. One theory holds free radicals responsible for normal ageing. </p> <p>Even in healthy people, the mitochondria in dopamine-producing cells are thought to produce a high level of these free radicals. The Parkinson's-causing effect of pesticides may be to increase the amount of \"waste\" the mitochondria produce, causing the death of the cells. </p> <p><br><strong>'You tell your body to move - and it doesn't'</strong></p> <p>It seemed trivial yet it was troubling. The instructor at the toddlers' gym where Maureen McHugh had taken her son asked the parents, as part of an exercise, to wiggle their fingers. Her brain responded, but her fingers didn't. </p> <p>\"I couldn't wiggle the fingers in my left hand,\" said Dr McHugh, 44, a soil scientist from Aberdeenshire. \"I started to lose mobility on my left side. Everyday tasks became difficult.\" </p> <p>That was in 1996. Despite signs that something was badly wrong, she did not consult a doctor until 1998, when she was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. </p> <p>\"Your brain tells your body to move and it does not,\" she said. \"It's going to get steadily worse. It's not supposed to shorten your life - it just makes life a complete misery.\" </p> <p>Since being diagnosed, Dr McHugh has been taking the drug L-dopa, which relieves Parkinson's symptoms. It does nothing to treat the cause, and can itself lead to serious disability after long use. But for the time being it enables her to carry out everyday tasks such as driving and helping her partner David Mills with their children. </p> <p>\"I'm fairly incapable at times,\" she said. \"Before I went on the medicine, I was virtually unable to do anything. Now I can do most normal things in a limited way, although I have to plan in advance.\" </p> <p>Dr McHugh has spent hours studying research into Parkinson's. She believes the evidence of a link between the illness and chemicals in the environment is strong. Over the years she has been exposed to different toxic chemicals in her work, but doubts that a single chemical such as rotenone is to blame. </p> <p>With hopes high that a treatment to end Parkinson's may be on the horizon, Dr McHugh is campaigning with other members of the Special Parkinson's Research Interest Group (Spring) to persuade the government to relax restrictions on scientists who believe the best hope of a cure lies in the using human stem cells to create new nerve cells to replace damaged ones. </p> <p>The only source of human stem cells is surplus human embryos donated by couples undergoing IVF treatment and at present scientists are barred from using these for research into anything other than fertility problems. </p> <p>\"It's vital that the government make these changes,\" said Dr McHugh. \"The embryos in question are very early. An individual being hasn't been established at that point.\"</p>",
  "Two weeks ago the singer Paul Weller, once of the Jam, was arrested in connection with the rape of a 36-year-old woman, four years ago. It made the front pages of some of the tabloids. Last week the police announced that he would not face any charges. Needless to say, that decision didn't get the same coverage. <p>Weller, understandably miffed, has called for the law to grant male rape suspects the same anonymity as that given to their alleged victims. His case is all the stronger because he was not even charged. There is nothing new in his demand, of course. Celebrities (such as Craig Charles of Red Dwarf) and non-celebrities (Austen Donnellan, accused of the date rape of a fellow student) who have gone through the ordeal of a highly publicised trial before being acquitted, have made similar points. Why should the name of the accused be, as it is always put, dragged through the mud when he is innocent, while the woman complainant who has told a pack of lies keeps her name secret? </p> <p>There is a superficial attraction in the equality argument: either do not reveal the rapist's name unless and until he is convicted (which is the practice in some countries) or, if his name is public, disclose the woman's identity if he is acquitted. </p> <p>It is a flawed argument. First, the fact that the man is acquitted does not necessarily mean that the woman is lying. It could be that the jury thought he had probably done it, but there was not enough evidence to be sure, beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, the reason for allowing rape complainants anonymity is to persuade women to report rapes; without that concession the reporting rate would be even lower than it is now. But if women knew their names would be revealed if their attackers were - perhaps wrongly - acquitted, they would surely think twice before reporting sexual attacks. </p> <p>This leaves one argument: why not keep an alleged rapist's identity secret until his conviction? We have a system of open justice in this country which, we rightly believe, is one of the hallmarks of a democratic society. Open justice means that the identities of those accused of crime are publicly known. Many of them will be innocent. Having their names bandied about will be embarrassing and sometimes devastating, whether they are charged with theft, murder, fraud or rape. But there is no reason for treating the alleged rapist more favourably than the alleged thief or fraudster. Unwelcome publicity is the price we pay for democracy. </p> <p> I'm impressed by a robust House of Lords ruling the other day on the freedom of the press. If this is a portent of the future attitude of the law lords, and of their leader, Lord Bingham, it is good news indeed. </p> <p>The case was about whether or not a journalist could be successfully sued for libel for his report of a press conference at which defamatory comments were made about the Belfast solicitors' firm that had represented the paratrooper Lee Clegg. The Northern Ireland appeal court had ruled that the press conference was not a \"public meeting\" and therefore reporting it didn't attract the \"qualified privilege\" that protects the reporter from a libel claim. The five law lords unanimously decided otherwise - it was a public meeting, with the reporters acting as \"the eyes and ears of the public\"; they therefore couldn't be sued for providing a fair and accurate account of it. </p> <p>Lord Bingham stressed the \"cardinal importance of press freedom\" and added: \"The proper functioning of a modern partici- patory democracy requires that the media be free, active, professional and inquiring.\" We're not accustomed to such talk from our judges. </p> <p> The result of the American presidential election could have a profound effect on future decisions of the US supreme court. The president appoints the judges and he chooses people likely to support his own agenda. And because the judges take decisions over such a wide range of issues with social consequences - the right to abortion is just one - it is no exaggeration to say that the make-up of the supreme court can influence the very fabric of American life. </p> <p>The astonishing thing about the court is that its judges are appointed for life (it used to be so here, but now law lords have to retire at 70) so that a new appointment can only be made when a judge decides to retire or dies. Two judges may be close to going, the 80-year-old Justice Stevens and the 76-year-old Chief Justice Rehnquist. At the moment, the nine-person court (including two women) is - just - weighted towards a \"liberal\" stance. </p> <p>But if Bush gets in and the liberal Stevens leaves, he will almost certainly be replaced by a \"conservative\", which would immediately tilt the balance. One of the consequences will be an attempt to claw back the abortion rights given to women by the momentous decision in Roe versus Wade. If Bush does win, the liberal (usually Democrat), hope will be that the conservative Rehnquist goes first. If he is replaced by a like-minded judge, it won't alter the balance. I look forward to the day when I'll be writing such analytical items about our judges in their new UK supreme court identities. It won't be long. </p> <p> Just a gentle reminder to the many thousands of broadcasters, journalists, politicians, famous people and members of the public who have, in the past few weeks, informed me, through the various media and on a variety of subjects, that the \"law is an ass\" - Charles Dickens wrote no such thing. \"If the law supposes that,\" said Mr Bumble in Oliver Twist, \"the law is a ass, a idiot.\"</p>",
  "<p>What a precious document is your CV - the deeply personal record of your status and achievement, your whole life contained in a couple of absolutely priceless pages. </p> <p>And on the open market, it is worth about five pence. </p> <p>It is an uncomfortable shock for job-hunters to find that there is a market in CVs. But their personal details, particularly when posted on the internet, can be hijacked and sold as a commodity, because, as any marketeer will confirm, there is value in names and addresses. </p> <p>It is a market discovered by Paul Smith, chief executive of FirstPersonGlobal.com, when planning his new online service. \"There are 3,000 job boards in action on the net, and I researched how they make money - which is by charging to advertise jobs, and charging to allow other agencies access. </p> <p>\"To make a commercial business or attract investment, you need both a candidate database and a client database. Down at the lower end of the market, where companies are desperate for capital, their benchmark is how many CVs they have, and how many people will pay to see them. If you look at the 'investor relations' section of some sites, you can see that they make their money this way.\" </p> <p>There is a huge number of CVs online - the biggest job-bank on the internet reports holding 700,000 - and the amount of private and personal data in cyberspace is immense. </p> <p>\"Some online agencies allow other agencies to search their candidate databases, for a fee,\" says Smith. \"If they openly say this, I suppose it's ethical. But candidates don't read an agency's conditions, so they are effectively giving permission for their CV to be distributed. I wonder if people know how much their data is open to the world.\" </p> <p>For the candidate, though, what is the problem in being exposed to more employers? \"There is no control over where your data goes,\" insists Smith. \"The very least damage that can be done is that your boss or human resources department recognises you and sees that you're look ing, so when a promotion comes up, you're listed as disloyal.\" </p> <p>It really is true, say all the agencies, that CVs unexpectedly get back to current employers. Even without a name, it is astonishing how many people can be recognised from a CV. Smith says that 80% of his clients think they could be recognised. </p> <p>\"Apart from a lot of personal data that you don't want spread around, I don't like the thought that there are millions of disappointed candidates putting their CVs up on websites and never getting a job - and yet their data becomes a number on the internet, touted around to make money.\" </p> <p>In a healthy job market in which well-qualified PAs are in demand, why should data be on sale? Why should agencies sell what would seem to be their most prized product? </p> <p>\"Is a PA database valuable? You bet,\" says Rosalind Renshaw, who publishes recruiters' newsletter Interviewer. \"It's part of the so-called war for talent. Good candidates have become a saleable, marketable commodity. It might seem crazy for an agency to sell its core asset, but it has certainly been known for a business in trouble to try to raise money by selling its database.\" </p> <p>Whatever the reason, Smith has been offered candidate databases at five pence a head, and Ian Wolter at Eden Brown reports having been offered databases two or three times, but having turned down the offers as \"shady\". Paul Barrett at Tempz.com points out that the value of a top PA's CV is readily understandable when related to the commission a headhunter would be paid to find her. </p> <p>Among other agencies, the most typical experience is that of Tate Appointments, which reports online agencies offering access to their databases in return for a search fee, or that of Secretaries Plus, which pays to access a well-known and reputable database, and transfers data on individual cases with a co-operative group of agencies - but only after asking candidates if they wish to be put forward for a specific job held by another agency. </p> <p>The unauthorised removal of employment data from websites is called \"scraping\", says Don McIntosh, chairman of the new association of online recruiters, the first group to bring agreed standards to web recruitment. And, he warns, scraping is not done only by small agencies - large names have also been guilty of it. </p> <p>Whatever the reasons for a trade in data, how can the jobhunter guard against the transfer of their personal details? </p> <p>\"Giving your life story to a complete stranger so that they can find you a job is something that demands trust, and looking for a job is enough of an emotional experience without worrying about this,\" says Tricia Phillips, London regional manager at Adecco. </p> <p>\"The question is, where does it stop? Is it now OK to share CVs with an insurance company so they can go round and sell something to the candidate? So, if you're registering online, be crystal-clear what you're agreeing to.\" </p> <p>\"To randomly post your CV is to allow anyone to use it,\" warns Jane Littlefield at Joslin Rowe. \"If you don't want your personal details bandied around the world, don't put them online.\" </p> <p><strong>Who is looking after your CV?</strong></p> <p><strong> Some major players and their policies </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Eden Brown:</strong> </p> <p>\"We have separate databases, and it is impossible to take our candidate details from the net; we never send out candidate details to anyone without their agreement.\" </p> <p><strong> Secretaries Plus:</strong> </p> <p>\"We won't send a CV to anyone without asking the candidate - not even if they have said 'just send it to anybody you think is right'.\" </p> <p><strong> Joslin Rowe:</strong> </p> <p>\"Our database is linked to our website, but is not accessible through it.

  "<p>Is a dyslexic secretary an oxymoron, an obvious contradiction in terms? According to the British Dyslexia Association (BDA), an estimated 4% of the population are severely dyslexic, but not all know that they are. </p> <p>Problems may only become evident in jobs where an individual's weaknesses are pushed to their limits. And administrators will undoubtedly fall into this field. </p> <p>News last week of a new website (<a href=\"http://www.dyxi.co.uk)\">www.dyxi.co.uk)</a> that claims to be the world's first web portal designed by dyslexics for dyslexics to discuss issues that affect them in the workplace serves to highlight the lack of commercial websites for dyslexic job- seekers. So, if you are trying to enter the workplace, or even if you have a secure position but happen to be dyslexic, can you or your boss do anything to ease the situation? </p> <p>Dyslexia is recognised as a disability under the Disability Discrimination Act. There are two ways in which an employer might unlawfully discriminate against a disabled employee or job applicant: first, by treating him or her less favourably (without justification) than other employees or applicants because of his or her disability; or, second, by not making reasonable adjustments (again, without justification). </p> <p>The problem with dyslexia is the stigma attached to admitting openly that you find reading and writing a problem. You need only to have suffered the nightmare that is the recruitment process to know that securing a job is, for most of us, the biggest hurdle of all on the path to a successful career. Imagine if you had the added complication of not being able to spell? How should employers and employees be approaching the interview process? </p> <p>Carol Orton, policy and information manager at the BDA, wrote a recent research paper, Recruitment - the dyslexic candidate, which looks into this area. Candidates in any recruitment process are immediately forced to read a copy of the job description and, if selected, are required to fill in an application form. For administration positions in particular, they will almost certainly be asked to complete a spelling test, too. So, argues Orton, three hurdles are instantly presented. </p> <p>How can employers help? On a practical level, personnel officers can use clear text when devising application forms. A flexible approach to accepting application forms via email or on disk will allow dyslexic applicants to complete the form by computer, thereby removing worry about presentation and enabling the use of a spell-check facility. While the use of coloured paper other than white for forms is seemingly irrelevant to a recruiter who has no reading difficulties, dyslexics often find pastel colours easier to read. </p> <p>Aptitude tests can also be modified. A first step, suggests the BDA, is to consult the dyslexic applicant to find out what adjustments might be required. Recruiters can help by allowing extra time for written papers where appropriate; 25% extra time is recommended. The importance of the entrance tests in relation to the job being applied for must be explained clearly to the candidate and alternative methods of eliciting the required information, such as verbal assessments and diagrams, should also be considered. </p> <p>With one in 10 people currently affected by dyslexia in a mild form, and one in 20 affected severely, a significant proportion of the population are at a disadvantage in the office. Juliet English, press officer at the BDA, insists that employers must wake up to today's workplace. \"The economic benefits of encouraging all employees to reach their full potential is obvious in business.\" She says that people calling attention to their dyslexia during the recruitment process and opening up dialogue with bosses will discourage the development of a culture of fear. </p> <p>How can administrators in particular make their lives easier? Suggesting small adjustments to the office environment, such as clearly labelled files, and tapes for dictation instead of written notes, can vastly improve individual working lives. There are now bespoke computer packages that offer a continuous spell-check facility, among other options, that can work on practically any Windows programme, word processor, spreadsheet, encyclopaedia, web page, Help File or educational programme. Administrators could make their boss aware of this. </p> <p>In the wake of dyslexia awareness week last week, the recruitment industry and employment organisations alike need to take heed. Geoff Armstrong, director general of the chartered institute of personnel and development, concludes that \"companies will benefit if they understand dyslexia - it is an area in which personnel and development professionals could usefully play a leading role.\" So that dyslexic secretary shouldn't need to worry at all. </p> <p>* British Dyslexia Assocation: <a href=\"http://www.bda-dyslexia.org.uk;tel\">www.bda-dyslexia.org.uk;tel</a> 0118 966 8271 * <a href=\"http://www.dyxi.co.uk\">www.dyxi.co.uk</a> * Saville &amp; Holdsworth Ltd has produced guidelines for testing people with disabilities.

  "<p>It is arguably the most important date in the literary calendar. Tomorrow night, the winner of this year's Booker Prize will be announced at a glittering televised ceremony at Guildhall in London. But while the distinguished guests settle down to a lavish dinner to await the announcement, Mary Brown will be working very hard in the background to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible. </p> <p>\"The Book Trust, an independent charity that promotes books and reading, initially administrates the Booker Prize,\" explains Brown, administrator for Colman Getty PR. \"We take over once the shortlist is announced - although we are working towards the ceremony all through the year. It takes a tremendous amount of organisation.\" </p> <p>UK publishers can enter up to two novels for a specific year, and any author who has previously won or been shortlisted for the prize can also be entered. \"The Booker judges read all the books - there were 120 submitted this year,\" says Brown. </p> <p>When the shortlist was announced on October 5, it fell to Brown to ring the relevant publishing houses to tell them the good news. \"That was a manic morning because a lot of people were out of the office at a press conference and everyone was screeching down the phone with excitement.\" Which is hardly surprising - not only does the winner receive what is generally considered the ultimate accolade for a fiction writer and \u00a321,000 in prize money, the effect on sales is staggering. The fastest selling winner to date is Roddy Doyle in 1993 with Paddy Doyle Ha Ha Ha; the morning following the awards ceremony it sold 27,000 copies in hardback within half an hour of bookshops opening. </p> <p>\"The publishers will then send us an unbound proof of their shortlisted book which is taken to a specialist bookbinder, so that we can give each of the authors a beautiful, handmade and leather-bound edition of his or her book,\" adds Brown. \"These are very valuable and kept under lock and key in a glass display case through the dinner until the time comes to present them.\" </p> <p>Brown is kept busy with the invitations. \"We start to draw up the list months in advance. There are certain people who are always invited but the list does change a lot from year to year. Of course, Booker plc, who finance the award, also invite guests so we have to run our suggestions by each other. Once the list has been agreed, we send out initial invitations with a letter that should be replied to by mid-October. This means we will know well in advance if someone won't be able to come and gives us the opportunity to ask someone else. Then we send out the official invitations.\" </p> <p>Organising the seating plan is one of the most difficult tasks. \"You have to be very diplomatic. Some people are very sensitive about whom they might be sitting with and you have to make sure you won't offend anyone. We have a huge plan of the tables up on the wall, and just juggle around with it until we've got it right.\" </p> <p>The judges do not come to a final decision until a few hours before the ceremony. When the decision has been made, the Colman Getty office is told. \"We then quickly pull a press release together which includes a quote from the chairman although the decision is still strictly under wraps.\" Then everyone heads off to Guildhall, where fax and email facilities have been set up to send off the press release once the winner has been officially announced. </p> <p>\"Everything is done with military precision,\" says Brown, who admits that, in addition to a strong interest in literature - she has a degree in English and philosophy - she is extremely organised. \"I temped on and off at the Poetry Book Society, but this is my first permanent job and I get tremendous satisfaction from seeing the systems I've devised working effectively.\" </p> <p>The Booker Prize always sparks off lively debate - and not just within literary circles. On the award's web site, users can vote online for their preferred winner out of the official shortlist and the result is announced a few days after the ceremony. \"Last year, the winner of the People's Booker, as it is known, was Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn for The Blackwater Lightship, rather than the official winner, JM Coetzee,\" says Brown. </p> <p>As Kingsley Amis put it, shortly after he was announced as the winner in 1986, \"I used to say that the Booker Prize was a bit artificial, but I have changed my mind in the last fifteen minutes. Now I feel it is a wonderful indication of literary merit.\"</p>"
