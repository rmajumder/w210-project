  "Film industry watchdogs last night warned the home secretary, Jack Straw, that his plans for a fresh clampdown on R18 sexually explicit videos will give the police \"Orwellian\" powers to enter private homes to check whether parents have hidden such videos from their children. <p>The British Board of Film Classification also attacked his plans to abolish the independent watchdog which last year passed them for sale in adult-only sex shops and appoint a new watchdog body in its place. The BBFC defended the video appeals committee, saying its appointment process should be kept separate from Whitehall. </p> <p>Mr Straw proposed the new controls on R18 videos after a high court ruling backed the video appeals committee's decision to legalise their sale. He claimed that the new controls were needed because there was evidence that paedophiles \"sometimes used this sort of material to 'groom' children for sexual abuse.\" </p> <p>But the BBFC, whose president is Andreas Whittam Smith, now says that such paedophiles also use a range of legitimate sex education videos and that the R18 category specifically bans any material involving children in a sexual context. </p> <p>\"The UK still probably has the strictest guidelines of any European or western nation,\" said the BBFC statement. \"There was also no evidence that in countries where pornography was more accessible, children had more problems as a result.\" </p> <p>The film standards watchdog however does want to see a legal requirement for all R18 videos to be labelled with a clear warning of the dangers of exposing children to their contents. </p> <p>The video standards council was also deeply critical of Mr Straw's proposal to create a new criminal offence of failing to take reasonable care to prevent a child from watching an R18 video.</p>",
  "<p>The only disappointment for Arsenal's fans last night was that their side only scored four times. Two up inside seven minutes, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's players slipped into cruise control and produced only bursts of brilliance to make sure of top spot in Group B. </p> <p>Goals by Ray Parlour, Lauren and Lee Dixon put Arsenal in control and although Sparta Prague pulled one back, Nwankwo Kanu added a fourth early in the second half. Sparta's spirit deserved the impressive injury-time goal added by Tomas Rosicky but they never looked likely to prevent Arsenal continuing their 100% record here this season. </p> <p>Arsenal knew that whatever happened they could look forward to playing in the second group stage, having qualified last week with that 1-1 draw at Lazio. But Wenger's team were aware that victory would guarantee top spot and ensure they could draw only one other group winner in the next round. The \u00a3200,000 offered by Uefa for a win must also have interested Wenger as he saves up for decent binoculars and a good lawyer in case his appeal against a 12-match touchline ban fails. </p> <p>Not that Sparta, beaten 1-0 by a piece of Silvinho magic in Prague, had promised to be pushovers. And they must have fancied their chances when they saw Arsenal's defence. </p> <p>With five centre-halves unavailable, Wenger deployed Oleg Luzhny and Nelson Vivas at the heart of a back four composed entirely of full-backs. Barely had Sparta had a chance to test any weaknesses, though, than they were two goals down. It seemed their back line was made of made of players with bad backs, never mind full-backs. </p> <p>Arsenal's first arrived in the fifth minute, Patrick Vieira passing square into the path of Parlour, who struck the ball sweetly past Tomas Postulka from 25 yards. </p> <p>Then, two minutes later, came the second. Robert Pires was the architect, bursting past Libor Sionko on the left flank and cutting back a cross which Lauren swept into the corner. Had Thierry Henry found the back rather than the side of the net when Jiri Novotny made a hash of a back-pass Arsenal would have been three up inside 10 minutes. And, not surprisingly, they drifted for a while. </p> <p>It needed a fine save from David Seaman to tip a Vladimir Labant free-kick on to the underside of the bar, and Arsenal frequently looked a combination of complacent and confused at the back as Sparta refused to throw in the towel. </p> <p>Not long after Sionko and Michal Hornak had headed chances wide, though, Arsenal scored a third. Postulka failed to hold Henry's free-kick and the captain Dixon slammed in the loose ball from a couple of yards. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Arsenal, Seaman had clearly watched that incident too closely. Shortly afterwards he let a Rosicky free-kick slip from his grasp and brought down Marek Kincl as the ball ran loose. To the delight of Sparta's 93 fans Labant scored from the penalty spot. </p> <p>Perhaps to keep them on their toes, Arsenal switched from blue shirts to yellow at the interval, though the official explanation was that the two teams looked too similar to the fourth official. </p> <p>Whatever, the change did not confuse Wenger's players. Six minutes into the second half Henry burst into the box down the left and although his cross was blocked by Postulka, Kanu showed off his wonderful balance to wrongfoot a defender and clip in the loose ball. </p> <p>Still Sparta refused to give up. Seaman atoned for his earlier error by saving well from Sionko and Dixon headed off the line from the resulting corner. But it mattered little as Arsenal looked forward to more testing European ties. </p> <p><strong> \u0095The Lazio defender Sinisa Mihajlovic last night apologised </strong> for the abuse he directed at Arsenal's Patrick Vieira in last week's Champions League match. Speaking before last night's home match against Shakhtar Donetsk, the Yu goslav said on the public address system: \"I know I made a mistake last Tuesday and I want to sincerely apologise to all those who felt rightly offended for the expression I used in a moment of particular tension on the field.\" Mihajlovic also called on Lazio fans to cease racist chanting. </p> <p> <strong> Arsenal</strong> (4-4-2): Seaman; Dixon, Vivas, Luzhny, Silvinho (Cole, h-t); Lauren, Parlour, Vieira, Pires (Bergkamp, 64min); Kanu, Henry (Wiltord, 71). </p> <p><strong> Sparta Prague </strong> (3-5-2): Postulka; Hornak, J Novotny, Bolf; Sionko (Papousek, 85), Jarosik, Rosicky, Hasek, Labant; Kincl, Jun (Mynar, h-t). </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> A Hamer (Luxembourg).</p>",
  "<p>Jim Smith is ready to call time on a managerial career spanning almost 30 years, paving the way for Colin Todd to take over at the Premiership's bottom club Derby County. </p> <p>Swindon Town, who hired Todd on a four-year contract five months ago, rejected Derby's initial approach as well as Todd's resignation proffered after Tuesday's 2-0 home defeat by Millwall. Talks are now ongoing about a compensation package. </p> <p>Derby issued a statement last night. \"After discussing personal terms, Colin Todd has agreed to join as Jim Smith's assistant manager. There is a matter of compensation which Colin and his adviser will be discussing with Swindon and matters cannot be finalised until then.\" </p> <p>Smith, 60 last week, is expected to become general manager at the end of the season but the likelihood is that the former Derby defender, who played for Smith at Oxford and Birmingham, will be handed control of first-team affairs within weeks. </p> <p>\"I have been managing football clubs for a long, long time but ideally I know how I would like it to finish,\" said Smith. \"I would like to be able to groom my successor - someone everyone here is agreed upon.\" </p> <p>Mark Bosnich has had another acrimonious row with Sir Alex Ferguson. After being ostracised since the summer signing of Fabien Barthez, the deposed goalkeeper incurred his manager's wrath again when he apparently arrived late for the flight to Brussels for Tuesday's Champions League game at Anderlecht. </p> <p>Bosnich claimed he had problems with his car but Ferguson refused to accept his version of events and dropped him from the bench in favour of Raimond van der Gouw. </p> <p>Michael Bridges, who scored 22 goals for Leeds last season but has been on the bench for most of this, needs an ankle operation and will be out for at least four months. </p> <p>Middlesbrough have been informed that the Milan midfielder Zvonimir Boban will be staying in Serie A this season and have turned their attention to Dino Baggio. The Boro manager Bryan Robson held talks with Parma last week and is understood to be preparing a \u00a35m bid for the 29-year-old. </p> <p>Baggio, who featured at USA 94 and France 98, has been told he can leave and almost joined Lazio in exchange for Nestor Sensini last month. </p> <p>\"There is no chance that Boban will leave,\" said Adriano Galliani, Milan's vice-president. \"His help will be crucial for the rest of the season, given that we're active on all fronts. For him to leave I have to sign and I refuse to do so.\" </p> <p>Crystal Palace, who suffered their sixth successive league defeat on Tuesday, have transfer-listed Clinton Morrison, Hayden Mullins, Jamie Smith and Julian Gray. \"There are people at this club who are not showing the right commitment or attitude and I won't put up with it any longer,\" said Alan Smith, Palace's manager. \"There is only so much you can do with players whose attitudes leave a lot to be desired.\" </p> <p>Watford have signed Stephen Armstrong from Vastra Frolunda to the end of the season. The 24-year-old, scorer of three goals in his 16 Swedish first division games, was born in Birkenhead but spent his childhood in South Africa.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The problem</strong></p> <p>I work night shift on security in a private factory, I have been doing this for 17 years now. It is beginning to takes it toll and I want to get out.</p> <p>I volunteered to do the job when I was working on the shop floor. My health has been suffering for a couple of years now, and no one appreciates the extra work that has come with the job. I have been overlooked three times for promotion.</p> <p>Could you please advice me on the best way to get out of my present job and go back on the shop floor. I have mentioned this to my line manager and he says that he is not prepared to release me.</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong></p> <p>I wonder why he won't \"release\" you? Is it because you are so indispensable in security? Or because he doesn't think you are up to shop floor work? Either way, what he probably does not realise is that he has a legal obligation towards you as a night worker. For a start, your employer should provide you with a free medical check and, if medical advice suggests that the nights are taking a toll on your health, your employer is obliged, where possible, to switch you to another shift. In your case, it would seem that a switch to shop work would certainly be possible, given your experience and qualifications. </p> <p>I suggest that you contact your union or local ACAS (number in the phone book) to confirm your rights. Then you could compose a letter to your line manager, (perhaps copied to his boss) in which you gently but assertively explain that you would like to come off the night shift as the 17 years working nights has taken a toll on your health. Remind him that night work does has this effect - this is why employers are obliged to provide medical checks and to switch employee's shifts where possible if medical advice recommends it. Explain that in your case it should be possible to switch shifts and state that you are more than happy to have a medical check if confirmation of the toll on your health is required.</p> <p>I imagine that such a letter will soon see your boss finding a way to \"release\" you!</p> <p> \u0095 Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes to Work (Purple House) and Managing Your Boss in a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton).</p> <p>Advice given to this problem should only be regarded as a guide based on the limited information provided by the letter-writer.

  "<p>Theatre becomes urgent, relevant and absolutely crucial in this double bill of plays. Both are set on Bradford's Buttershaw estate, one of Britain's deprived housing schemes, wracked over the past 40 years by unemployment, poverty and cheap heroin. </p> <p>In Buttershaw you find what right-wing sociologist Charles Murray calls \"the underclass\"; in reality, struggling single mums trying to bring up their kids decently on no money, no hope and in the absence of men who have become redundant in every sense. As Mum says in Rita, Sue and Bob Too, written in 1982 by the then 21-year-old Andrea Dunbar: \"Anyway, all men are no good. They want shooting for all the trouble they cause.\" There was something prophetic in those words. </p> <p>Rita, Sue and Bob Too was the second of three plays that Dunbar wrote before a fatal brain haemorrhage at 29. This grim little comedy about two 15-year-old girls' affair with the same married man, was one from the heart. She only wrote about what she knew. Max Stafford Clark, then director of the Royal Court, commissioned the play and now revives it and pairs it with a new work, A State Affair by Robin Soans. Soans's play is a piece of verbatim theatre created via interviews with people who live in Buttershaw today. </p> <p>If, for all its mouthy, larky high spirits, Rita Sue and Bob Too has a hard-boiled desperate edge, A State Affair is like falling down a deep, dark well. It depicts a war zone where the front line consists of people struggling with understated heroism to hold their lives together and deal with the consequences of addiction, child abuse, domestic violence and lack of hope. </p> <p>On its own, either play would have impact. Together, they cannot be ignored. One springs from the other. That was then and this is now. A State Affair ends poignantly with Dunbar's own daughter, Lorraine, a former drug addict, being given voice: \"If my mum wrote the play now, Rita and Sue would be smackheads on crack as well... and working the red light districts, sleeping with everybody and anybody for money.\" </p> <p>Max Stafford Clark's production is matter of fact, unobtrusive and best of all, honest. So are the performances. It never lets you forget that, in reality, there are people on the Buttershaw estate who are living this piece of theatre every day. </p> <p>\u0095 Until November 4.

  "<p>An HIV victim from Colombia, jailed for causing grievous bodily harm and possessing drugs, yesterday won the right under the Human Rights Act to stay in Britain pending the outcome of his ex-partner's application for asylum. </p> <p>A high court judge ruled that to deport the father of three, who has been refused asylum himself, while his children remained in Britain, would create a serious risk of breaching his right to respect for family life under article 8 of the European convention on human rights. </p> <p>The case is among the first of an expected barrage of challenges under the convention, now incorporated into domestic law by the Human Rights Act. </p> <p>The man, named only as R, sought judicial review of a Home Office decision last summer to send him back to Colombia following his release from prison after serving 18-months for grievous bodily harm and a concurrent eight weeks for drink-driving and possession of drugs. </p> <p>He has suffered a number of Aids-related illnesses since being diagnosed as HIV positive in 1995 and is undergoing treatment at a London hospital. </p> <p>Mr Justice Gage said the home secretary was entitled to take into account criminal convictions when deciding whether to allow asylum seekers to enter or remain in Britain. Buthe must take into account convention rights and not act in a way which was \"disproportionate\". To remove R because of his criminal convictions \"would seem to me disproportionate\". </p> <p>R, in his thirties, had been in Britain for more than seven years and his youngest child was born here. He was still in close contact with his children. </p> <p>The mother of his children, from whom he is separated, launched her own claim for asylum three years ago. </p> <p>The couple, who were not married, arrived in Britain together in April 1993. </p> <p>The immigration authorities had expressed concern that the family could \"string out\" their stay in the UK by making sequential applications for asylum, but the judge made it clear proper regard had to be paid to convention rights. </p> <p>He said of the ex-partner's asylum claim: \"It seems to me that if she were given permission to remain in this country there is a serious risk that to remove him would be a breach of his rights under article 8 of the convention.\" </p> <p>However, her application remained outstanding and the probability was that she and the children would not be allowed to stay. In that case there would be no convention breach in R's case, said the judge. </p> <p>He dismissed R's application for judicial review on condition the Home Office undertook not to enforce R's deportation until his ex-partner's application was determined. </p> <p>The Refugee Legal Centre had unsuccessfully applied to the immigration authorities for R to be allowed exceptional leave to remain in the country because of his HIV. </p> <p>The judge rejected R's claim that he would face death within a matter of months if he was sent back to Colombia because he would not be able to obtain effective treatment for HIV in his home country. </p> <p>His counsel, James Gillespie, had argued that his right to life would be threatened and that deportation would involve inhumane and degrading treatment, contrary to articles 2 and 3 of the convention. </p> <p>The judge ruled there would be no violation of those rights because there was evidence he would be able to obtain proper treatment in Colombia.</p>",
  "The former Conservative prime minister Sir Edward Heath , who became Father of the House of Commons, last night ended intense speculation about his future and announced his retirement as an MP after more than 50 years at Westminster. <p> His letter to party activists in Old Bexley and Sidcup prompted a flood of tributes to the politician who took a wary Britain into Europe in 1973 - hoping in vain that he had finally settled the country's post-imperial destiny.</p> <p> Instead, the man who had drastically reformed trade union law suddenly fell from power over a miners' strike. Ousted by Margaret Thatcher in a Palace of Westminster coup in 1975, he resorted to one of the longest sulks in public life over his treatment by her.</p> <p> As the former prime minister (1970-74) last night flew out of London to visit Japan and China - where he is held in very high regard as a friend - Tony Blair spoke of his \"outstanding contribution\" and political courage.</p> <p> William Hague said he would be \"greatly missed\" while Michael Heseltine likened his European achievements to victory in the second world war.</p> <p> But Lady Thatcher, whom Sir Edward regularly denounced for 25 years, made no immediate statement.</p> <p> Though he aroused fierce loyalty among Europhile Tories like Mr Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, Sir Edward was seen as a \"traitor\" and \"virtually a socialist\" by Thatcherite Tories.</p> <p> To them Europe and economic pragmatism were his great crimes.</p> <p> The decision by Sir Edward, 84, to step down at the coming general election - which had been widely predicted but never quite believed - came the day after he presided over a seven-hour process to elect Labour's Michael Martin as new Speaker of the Commons.</p> <p> Like much else in his career, Sir Edward's handling of the election had provoked both praise and criticism, much of it from MPs on both sides, who argued that he should have used his authority to change the rules - and get the 12-candidate election over with in two quick ballots.</p> <p> Last night he stressed that the timing of his decision had nothing to do with that controversy, but was tied to Conservative HQ's deadline of November 1 for older members to state their intentions for the coming election.</p> <p> In 1997 the amateur yachtsman and musician - who conducted great orchestras - had a majority of 3,569 (6.9%) over Labour, which will now try to seize the seat.</p> <p> Sir Edward's 50 years of unbroken service as an MP fell short of David Lloyd George's 54 years and that of his hero, Sir Winston Churchill, who served 62 years in all. Like Sir Edward, Churchill, who stayed an MP until he was 89, also rejected a peerage. In the 50s, Sir Edward had been one of Churchill's rising young stars.</p> <p> Colleagues at Westminster had said that Sir Edward's constituency activists hoped he would quit, but did not want to hurt his feelings by asking. He was still busy locally and yesterday Barry Fowler, his Bexley secretary, called him a \"national and international politician who never once forgot his constituents\".</p> <p> Beset by European problems of his own, Mr Blair struck a more ambiguous note.</p> <p> \"It was Sir Edward who took this country into the European community and he can be justly proud of that. Whether you agree with his views or not, no one is ever in any doubt what they are,\" he said.</p>",
  "The Ivory Coast's opposition leader, Laurent Gbagbo, today swept to power after a people's revolt ousted military ruler General Robert Guei. <p>Tens of thousands of people took the streets to protest after Gen Guei proclaimed himself the winner of Sunday's presidential election following his dissolution of the national electoral commission which organised the vote.</p> <p>Several potential candidates, including former prime minister Alassane Ouattara, were barred from standing in the poll by the supreme court. Today Mr Ouattara's supporters marched through the Ivory Coast's capital, Abidjan, calling for a new election.</p> <p>Gen Guei has fled Abidjan for Cotonou in nearby Benin, his former information minister, Henri Cesar Sama, said. Mr Sama was among the soldiers who turned against the dictator. </p> <p>Mr Sama said that pro-Gbagbo soldiers were trying to convince the remaining junta forces to put down their arms. He said another senior junta member, Captain Saint Cyr Djikalou, had also defected. </p> <p>The general came to power in a December coup, the first military takeover in Ivory Coast. Instability since has battered the economy and frightened the people. Gen Guei had promised that the elections would mark a return to civilian rule. </p> <p>Violent clashes erupted yesterday after Mr Gbagbo called on his supporters to take to the streets. Opposition leaders claimed nine people were killed.</p> <p>Before dawn today, mutinous soldiers were defeated by loyalist comrades in an Abidjan military base. Hours later, thousands of Mr Gbagbo's supporters swarmed through the streets of Abidjan, erecting barricades, lighting fires and screaming for Gen Guei's resignation. </p> <p>Soldiers loyal to Gen Guei fired shots in the air as they attempted to disperse unarmed demonstrators gathering outside the dictator's residence, in an exclusive suburb of the capital. </p> <p>But by midday, more members of the security forces had joined the ranks of the protesters. Demonstrators had overrun broadcast facilities for state radio and television, and thousands more were outside the broadcast offices in central Abidjan. At least two people were killed and four were injured in the clashes, witnesses said. </p> <p>Mr Gbagbo was introduced as \"president; in an address broadcast on state television and said he would be forming a cabinet shortly. He praised his supporters for opposing what he called Gen Guei's \"electoral coup d'etat\". </p> <p>\"I pay particular homage to those who died in the cause of this,\" he said. \"We will give them a funeral befitting their courage,\" he said. The speech was recorded at his campaign headquarters, where it was played on loudspeakers to hundreds of cheering supporters standing outside. </p> <p>The announcement triggered celebrations on the streets of Abidjan and of the western city of Gagnoa, a Gbagbo stronghold. Some protesters beat on drums while others sang and danced in the streets.</p> <p><br><b>Useful Links</b><br><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200010250035.html\">Analysis - allAfrica.com</a> <br><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200010250032.html\">Related story - allAfrica.com</a><br><a href=\"http://web.amnesty.org/ai.nsf/Index/AFR310032000?OpenDocument&amp;of=COUNTRIESCOTE+D'IVOIRE\">Background - Amnesty International</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.georgetown.edu/kokora/political/gbagbo10.htm\">Speech: Gbagbo - Georgetown University</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,387599,00.html\"> Previous events: 'rigged' vote - Guardian</a><br><a href=\"  http://news6.thdo.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid%5F930000/930254.stm\"> Profile: Robert Guei - BBC</a></p>",

  "<p>Where I grew up in western Canada in the 60s, the first snow would usually have fallen by October 31. This often provoked bitter battles between mothers, concerned about exposing tender young legs and heads to biting temperatures, and children determined to show off the full glory of their costumes. At six, I was particularly bad-tempered about having to tramp along the icy streets of Calgary carrying my loot bag up my neighbours' driveways with my beautiful nylon and coat-hanger wire wings crushed beneath my duffle coat. \"Fairies don't wear boots!\" I yelled before leaving the house that evening. </p> <p>Given that Hallowe'en came over with those 19th-century Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famines, it seems ironic that it is now understood as a North American tradition, fast gaining popularity in the UK. But my memories of bitter nights - harbinger of long, hard winters - is exactly what the ancient Celts were celebrating in Ireland. The modern ritual has its origins in the ancient Celtic fire festival and New Year, the night when fairies would traipse through the land. At this bewitching time, people would imitate fairies, going from house to house begging treats and, if they were not given, playing practical jokes upon the owner. </p> <p>Throughout my childhood, Hallowe'en was a huge event, the run-up a fever-pitch of excitement second only to Christmas. There were weeks during recess when we'd grill each other with, \"So, what are you going as?\" and then further time spent convincing a parent to stoop over a sewing machine or make a trip uptown to the department stores. Ghosts, cowboys, goblins, skeletons, fairies and monsters were popular. </p> <p>Hallowe'en was full of forbidden pleasures. Going out after dark with a bunch of other kids, getting a sackful of treats and having permission to pull a few \"tricks\" like wrapping trees in toilet paper or setting off firecrackers. But this misrule was balanced by churches and schools turning us all into UN volunteers. Every year, I took a Unicef collection box on Hallowe'en which we would shake at our neighbours who kept a stack of pennies ready on a tray next to the candy. While we gorged, we remembered the children of Biafra. </p> <p>There was a darker side to Hallowe'en, too. It flourished in \"real-life\" ghost stories, and urban legends about children who died eating apples that had razor blades embedded in their flesh or who went mad from drugged candy bars. Yet these were apocryphal tales not linked to anyone we ever knew, and no neighbours refused us entry except the Jehovah's Witnesses who lived down the road. Parents would maintain a respectful distance as children charged up garden paths. </p> <p>Now that I live in England with my two young daughters, I am conscious that Hallowe'en has an entirely different meaning. The biggest single influence over my daughter's excitement about Hallowe'en is her general infatuation with witches and wizardry, inspired by JK Rowling's Harry Potter series. Hallowe'en themes are with us all year through television programmes such as Sabrina and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. When we gave a Hallowe'en party last year, all 10 girls came dressed as witches, and \"playing Harry Potter\" is a favourite after-school game. </p> <p>The idea of trick or treat, however, seems alien here. The children who call at my south London home on Hallowe'en are rare and, even in those neighbourhoods where children fill up loot bags, the process is orchestrated by parents. Other friends report that Hallowe'en on the street runs a definite second to private fancy-dress parties and certainly to Guy Fawkes night. </p> <p>But when I watch my daughter getting dressed for her party, donning false fingernails and taking up her home-made wand, I realise there is an eternal magic to Hallowe'en that transcends cultural boundaries. For one night at least, the children, like ancient Celtic fairies, are in control.</p>",
  "<p>Tension over the future role of social services departments has again broken surface, following reported remarks last week by Paul Boateng, Home Office minister and head of the government's new children and young people's unit. </p> <p>His comments prompted anxiety among many of those at the annual social services conference last week in Edinburgh. Rita Stringfellow, who chairs the Local Government Association's social affairs and health executive, issued an angry statement saying she was \"shocked and deeply offended\" by her Labour colleague. </p> <p>The trouble was caused by an interview by Boateng in Community Care magazine, in which he was quoted as saying that social services departments had \"let down children year and year upon year\". It was \"fanciful\" to imagine they could have a key role in administering the new \u00a3450m children's fund designed to support preventive services for vulnerable youngsters. Instead, the bulk of the fund would be given to \"local partnerships\", with the remaining \u00a370m controlled by a children's charity. </p> <p>The interview was picked up by the Daily Mail, which reported the remarks under the headline: \"I've no faith in social workers, says Labour's family minister.\" The newspaper linked the attack to what it said were Home Office attempts to strip local authorities of responsibility for adoption. </p> <p>Stringfellow, who has previously been reluctant to speak out in the face of criticism of social services by Labour ministers and their staff, said: \"Paul Boateng's statement that local authorities be cut out of local partnerships delivering services to children is completely counter to central and local government's stated commitment to joined-up government and partnership working. Only recently, the government gave local authorities a number of new duties and responsibilities, through legislation and other initiatives, because ministers have recognised the vital role councils play in their communities.\" </p> <p>Children did not care who ran the show provided they got reliable and responsive services, said Stringfellow. \"Councils have proved they can - and are providing this.\"</p>",
  "<p>Cities are places of extremes - and an urban renaissance could make them more so. The very wealthy and the very poor often live as near neighbours, with walls, visible or invisible, in between. The gradual recovery of city centres has pushed up property prices far beyond expectations, making them unaffordable to all but a lucky few. Their density, night life, busy streets and original spaces make them highly attractive to some, but unsuitable or unattainable for others. </p> <p>City centres sit cheek by jowl with some of the poorest and increasingly abandoned inner-city neighbourhoods. People who cannot afford, or do not want, luxury city centre apartments, warehouse or canalside flats often reject the inner neighbourhoods that ring city centres and prefer to leapfrog to the quieter, safer, greener suburbs. </p> <p>But as land becomes scarcer and smaller households multiply, the poorer inner areas of London, Edinburgh and other successful cities gain new \"kerb appeal\". These large, under-exploited and often uncared for areas hold the key to affordable housing. They have capacity; they have surviving but struggling communities; they offer proximity, transport, amenities. They contain potentially valuable, already existing, mixed-use communities. They cry out for \"urban pioneers\" to help reclaim them and restore their vibrancy. </p> <p>To overcome the long legacy of social exclusion, cities must hold on to both richer and poorer residents. Their interests coincide. They both want good quality, spacious homes in a pleasant, safe environment, close to work, good schools, shops and transport. The two groups need each other. The original welfare state was built on this compact. So are cities. The rich pay in, and gain, alongside the poor - and both benefit. </p> <p>The voices of citizens are crucial to regenerating cities. People roundly rejected the old, over-dense, disease- ridden, filthy, impoverished industrial cities and fled if they could. But planners, largely without community consent, then decided to dismember our traditional compact urban patterns into ghettoised estates and suburban sprawl. Now people are beginning to come back, seeking a new kind of density - of services, leisure, new jobs, social contact and support. </p> <p>Mixed communities are hard to plan, but if we are serious about protecting the countryside and recycling buildings and \"brown\" land, they will occur naturally - within the inner areas of towns and cities where space, historic buildings and a close-woven pattern of streets offer boundless scope for new ideas. </p> <p>Citizens gravitate towards compact cities because they like their energy, opportunity, diversity and excitement, all of which are the results of close proximity. But attractive, integrated urban environments do not just happen. They are the product of choice, good design and sound organisation. </p> <p>Obviously, no one individual or group can pull it off. Cities require both collective action and a host of individual efforts - the special contribution of \"urban pioneers\". It requires not just vision and leadership, but architecture, engineering, social and communication skills. Buildings within existing streets and neighbourhoods can meet changing needs. They require, in addition to careful design itself, high quality craftsmanship, attention to detail, tight control of conditions, and long-term management. </p> <p>It is the rediscovery of the compact city, of the value of social contact and interchange, of the potential for reintegrating our fragmented society, that makes older, poorer city centres suddenly more desirable. Birmingham, Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle-upon-Tyne epitomise this shift of attitude. But it needs a strong social and political commitment, as well as careful design, to pull the different communities together and encourage a sense of shared citizenship, a desire to live as well as work in the city. The run-down inner areas that ring revitalising cores need the people who use the centre, otherwise they will empty and die. </p> <p>Can we stem the leapfrogging motion to new green field development? If city councils support local effort and devolve some resources and decisions to neighbourhood level, inner neighbourhoods can build up unique local centres with their own identity - real urban villages. Highbury, in north London, is a good example. These neighbourhoods will then attract residents working in the city who can contribute to their regeneration. At the same time, they can hold on to their traditional communities which will gain from the new growth. Shops and schools will stay open; street conditions will improve; empty, underused property will be renovated and bare spaces from earlier demolitions will be filled in. </p> <p>We need to work from the centre outwards, layer by layer, and start by reconnecting, restoring and repopulating the innermost neighbourhoods, which are only minutes on foot from vibrant centres. Helping people feel they have a voice in making their neighbourhoods work will relieve the sense of powerlessness that often makes city dwellers seek simpler, more peaceful environments. </p> <p>\u0095 Anne Power is professor of social policy at the London School of Economics. She is co-author, with Lord (Richard) Rogers of Cities for a Small Country, published this week by Faber and Faber at \u00a314.99. Lord Rogers chairs the government's urban taskforce, of which Power is a member</p> <p><strong> Dense idea demolished - tough lessons from the rise and fall of the Marquess estate </strong><br></p> <p>If the government's urban taskforce had been around in 1977, you can imagine it would have warmly approved of the then brand new Marquess estate in Islington, north London. </p> <p>The estate represented a number of the themes that Lord Rogers, Anne Power and the other taskforce members have so enthusiastically backed. It was on a brownfield site; it was well designed by Darbourne and Darke - leading architects of the day; it put the pedestrian first; and it was built to high density, with 200 bed spaces per acre (or 494 per hectare). </p> <p>In a deliberate contrast to 1960s tower blocks, the estate was designed as a series of streets and alleys of mostly family houses with gardens around a series of green spaces. In short, it was an environment that Rogers and Power are now calling for - \"dense but green\". </p> <p>The scheme was highly commended for good design in housing by the old Department of the Environment, and it was described as a \"magnificent showpiece\" by the then prime minister, Harold Wilson, when he came to open it. But, soon after, the Marquess became a disaster. It quickly gained a fearsome reputation as an area of high crime, with twice as much vandalism as anywhere else in the borough. Its tightly compact and intricate layout was seen as a major cause of crime and fear of crime on the estate. The police said the design \"lends itself to crime\". </p> <p>Rogers and Power now argue that \"denser and more compact urban forms\" provide more \"informal policing\" than lower density areas. But research by Bill Hillier, at University College London, found that the Marquess's compact layout meant that very few people walked through the estate. So, in this case, there was actually less self-policing because of the compact layout. </p> <p>The problems at the Marquess, which also included damp and noisy flats, became so acute that Islington took the drastic step of deciding to tear down 463 of the homes. It is now rebuilding the estate, on a more simple street pattern in partnership with Southern Housing Group (SHG). </p> <p>Renamed New River Green, the estate is being opened up to encourage more people to walk through. More homes for sale and shared ownership are also being provided in an attempt to promote a mixture of incomes on the estate. Housing minister Nick Raynsford gave his seal of approval to the \u00a322m project when he visited work in progress last week. </p> <p>What is interesting in the light of the call by Rogers and Power for more compact cities is that the remodelled estate now has significantly fewer homes. More than 150 of them are not being replaced in the rebuilding work. Teresa Shaffer, SHG senior development officer, says regeneration of the estate \"would not work\" without reducing the density. </p> <p>Raynsford, himself an enthusiast for high density, points out that density on the estate is still high - even with the loss of 155 homes. But he says: \"The Marquess was too large: it had a high concentration of poor families in close proximity, with no mix of tenures.\" </p> <p>Under new guidance from the Housing Corporation, the reduction in density at the Marquess would now be frowned upon. Egged on by the urban task force, the corporation now warns it will be \"very cautious\" about funding regeneration schemes that do not at least maintain the density of any demolished homes. </p> <p>If this guidance was to be rigidly applied, the type of refurbishment undertaken at the Marquess would not be possible. The same goes for the flagship regeneration scheme at Holly Street in Hackney, east London, which also involved a reduction in density. </p> <p>Simon Dow, deputy chief executive of the corporation, claims that the agency will be more flexible than the guidance suggests. But he says: \"We will challenge density a lot more than we have in the past. We are learning about trying to get more homes into the inner city.\" </p> <p>To avoid suburban sprawl, we need to get more homes into the inner city. This can be successfully achieved. As Rogers and Power point out, some of the most desirable homes in the country are built at high densities, from Kensington in west London to Edinburgh New Town. But the experience of the Marquess estate shows that high density itself is no panacea. </p> <p> \u0095 Matt Weaver is news editor of Building Design magazine</p>",
  "<p>February 1989 was a tetchy month. Brian Clough, manager of Nottingham Forest, was fined \u00a35,000 by the FA for punching fans who invaded the pitch after a game; and health minister Edwina Currie got stroppy with a Commons committee questioning her about the salmonella outbreak. Then things got really nasty: Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran ordered Muslims to kill Salman Rushdie for the offence caused to Islam by his book, The Satanic Verses. </p> <p>There had already been big demonstrations and public burnings of the novel by Muslims. These had followed an ineffective first stage of the campaign: letter-writing to and lobbying of MPs and ministers. By the time Ayatollah Khomeni pronounced a fatwa, the stakes had risen for Rushdie: he had become a hunted man, fearing for his life. </p> <p>But as the campaign escalated, the stakes became higher for Muslims too. There was hostile reaction from non-Muslims, reviling them for insisting that a blasphemer should pay with his life. Muslim activists had failed to anticipate such a counterattack, and were divided on the best way of getting justice from a secular government for the defamation of their religion. </p> <p>With Islamaphobia as an added factor, they found the Rushdie affair was, in part, a trial of the strength and coherence of the Islamic community, which was taking root and growing in cities such as Bradford and Birmingham. It was a unique experience for an immigrant community. It is hard to think of any other minority ethnic group being tested by so crucial a wake-up call as Khomeini's. </p> <p>Rushdie disappeared the day the fatwa was issued. It was February 14, and he went into hiding after attending a memorial service for the writer Bruce Chatwin, at the Greek Orthodox cathedral in Bayswater, west London. Spring and summer were marked by marches, demonstrations and arrests, with protesters frustrated at their impotence to get legal redress because Islam was not covered by the blasphemy law. </p> <p>What has been the effect of those turbulent times? A Channel 4 documentary, Words of Fire, has asked some of those involved at the time what they feel has been the lasting effect of the campaign against Rushdie. </p> <p>Most of the protests and public burnings of The Satanic Verses took place in Bradford. Aki Nawaz, 27 at the time, grew up there, and was very concerned that the general British public did not realise that a grave spiritual offence had been committed by Rushdie. In the early 90s, Nawaz founded the punk rock band Fundamental, to carry the message of protest. Looking back, he reckons the reaction at the time was instinctive, frustrated and somewhat naive. He is still annoyed that there was no proper debate about the hurt which Rushdie's work had caused. \"We were willing, as grassroots people off the street, to talk about it, but there was no discussion,\" he says. </p> <p>The community was divided over what to do, and sought leaders of stature to put its case. Nawaz blames the author, the then Conservative government and even some Muslims for not arranging a forum. In the absence of a debate, some Muslims went along with the fatwa, even though they were not comfortable with it. </p> <p>If Islam faced a blasphemous attack today, Nawaz believes the reaction would be exactly the same. \"The community hasn't forgotten, and definitely hasn't come up with some liberal reason to forgive Rushdie,\" he says. Even now, he'd like to see Rushdie facing Islamic scholars in a TV debate. </p> <p>Apart from lobbying and marching, British Muslims - who began to identify themselves as such, as opposed to \"Asian\" - began to find other ways ways of setting their agenda: through popular culture (such as Nawaz's band); by setting up the self-styled Muslim parliament (intended as a separate, parallel forum to Westminster). A third strand was an interest in human rights for Asian immigrants. </p> <p>The parliament, with its specifically Muslim agenda, was a clever move, but it fizzled out after four years. It exists now only as a committee, meeting occasionally. At least now there are more Asians in mainstream Westminster politics, but the head of the Muslim Institute, Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, regrets that more have not emerged to argue their case. \"We still do not have philosophers, writers and journalists (to put our case),\" he says. \"It is time for such people to appear.\" </p> <p>Others disagree and say there is a rising group of movers and shakers in the professions, not least the media. Masoud Shajareh is a former member of the parliament, who thinks that its remaining rump is of no consequence. </p> <p>Shajareh believes that the Rushdie affair was a catalyst. It led to change in the community: in his case, this means he is now working for an Islamic human rights group. \"Because of Islamaphobia, Muslim issues are not getting a fair hearing,\" he argues. \"In the last 10 years, 70% of the victims of racially motivated attacks are Muslims.\" But, he maintains, enough protection is still not being provided. </p> <p>Many Muslims featured in the documentary still feel shocked at the hatred of Islam which surfaced a decade ago, on top of existing racism. The Satanic Verses was the first time the community had to put up with such an obscene attack on its values, says Siddiqui. And, as an unsure and marginalised group, it felt the refusal of British government ministers to act on its behalf was all part of a conspiracy. </p> <p>\"Muslims always accept that people will criticise their faith, but here was a book that hit below the belt,\" Siddiqui says. \"It wasn't an academic book.\" </p> <p>It's quite easy to find young Muslims who are critical of the community leadership a decade ago. Many of those older leaders are still in place, though they're wise enough to acknowledge the new activists. \"Here in the new mosque in Leicester, there are a large number of young people, more young people than old,\" says Faiyazuddin Ahmad, of the Islamic Foundation. \"Society is now very vibrant. People know their neighbours much more intimately than before.\" </p> <p>Communities may well be more aware of each other's religious and cultural customs, but what if there was another Rushdie? \"These sorts of questions should not be asked,\" says Ahmad sternly. \"This speculation doesn't do society any good.\" </p> <p> <strong>The book that outraged Islam</strong><br></p> <p> The Satanic Verses was published in Britain in 1988, when Salman Rushdie was 41. The controversy raged round Rushdie's fictional prophet, who founds a religion. Muslims argued that scenes in the novel set in Mecca and mentioning aspects of Mohammed's life (particularly his teachings and his wives) were a blasphemous travesty of the truth. They were outraged that the satanic verses of the title were taken as an authentic part of the Koran, when they are not accepted as such by scholars.</p> <p> \u0095 Words of Fire, part of Channel 4's Black and Asian history season, will be shown at 8pm on Saturday</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of Gypsies will go to the small Cotswold town of Stow-on-the-Wold tomorrow to keep an ancient tradition alive. Horses will be traded, crockery will be bought and sold and old friendships renewed. The last Gypsy horse fair of the year is a place to swap not just goods but gossip. </p> <p>One topic that is likely to arouse much passion are the attacks that have been made this summer on the dozen Gypsy horse fairs held throughout Britain. The fairs are the rural equivalent of the Notting Hill carnival to Britain's Romani ethnic minority - except you won't see any policemen dancing or singing. </p> <p>Policemen were marching on September 10 this year when a five-mile exclusion zone, complete with road blocks and armed units, was set up to ban the ancient Horsmonden horse fair in Kent. Local councillors, irritated by the disruption to the local community, banned the one-day fair, which has traditionally been held on Horsmonden's village green. </p> <p>Hundreds of Gypsies attempted to enter the village with horses and wagons, only to be searched and held up at roadblocks for hours. A solitary horse-drawn Romani vardo (caravan), which had evaded the police operation, led a protest march through the village. </p> <p>Eli Frankham, president of the National Romani Rights Association, organised the march. He is enraged at the way his people have been treated. \"My grandmother was born on Horsmonden green,\" he says. \"In an age when nomadic life is outlawed, fairs such as these bind our community together. They are the places we meet, trade and continue our traditions. The attack on this fair is a direct assault on the Gypsy community of this country.\" </p> <p>The Horsmonden fair doesn't only attract Gypsies. Ex-agricultural workers from the east end of London, who worked alongside Romanies in the Kentish hop fields earlier this century, stand alongside ex-rag and bone men whose passion for horses has outlived the demise of their trade. Together, they make up Britain's other horse culture. </p> <p>The fairs may not be as classy as gymkhanas, the Badminton horse trials or foxhunting, but they are a part of country culture no one from the Countryside Alliance is interested in. When horseboxes destined for a local gymkhana sailed through the roadblocks banning Horsmonden fair, Susanna Hersey, a Romani woman who settled in the village over 30 years ago, recognised double standards she has seen all her life. </p> <p>\"It makes me very angry,\" she says, \"I've lived and paid taxes here for 30 years. I've loved and attended the fair since I was a child, but this year many of my family weren't even allowed to come to my house on fair day.\" Susanna may have chosen to settle in the garden of England, but some roses, it seems, smell sweeter than others. </p> <p>The Horsmonden ban is only the tip of the iceberg in a campaign of cultural cleansing which Gypsies say is being waged throughout England. As the only Gypsy horse fair in the country without a royal charter guaranteeing its continued existence, Horsmonden fair was banned by a single parish council meeting. </p> <p>Getting rid of the larger fairs at Stow and at Appleby, in Cumbria, will require an act of parliament unless no one attends the fairs and the annual tradition is broken. Local authorities seem to have that end in mind as they continue a war of attrition in the form of court injunctions and police harassment. </p> <p>Stow-on-the-Wold has held its five-day fair ever since it was granted by royal charter in 1476, but a court injunction now threatens every trader with imprisonment if they camp overnight in the field in which it is held. </p> <p>A spokesperson for Cotswold district council, which took out the injunction, says: \"The object is not to discourage the fair, but to control the level of disturbance to local residents.\" </p> <p>Vera Norwood, the chair of Stow town council, disagrees. \"My personal opinion is that the Gypsies should be allowed to hold the fair without interference,\" she says. \"They own the field and should just be allowed to get on with it.\" </p> <p> The authorities' tactics range from misinformation about the dates of the fair, to the closing of public toilets and persuading local pubs to close when the fair is on. Similar tactics can be seen from Priddy fair, in Somerset, to Appleby. But the Gypsies keep coming; it will take more than a court injunction and a few closed doors to overcome the tenacity of the Romani people. </p> <p>Over the years the fairs have changed, but they have lost none of their social importance for courting or binding the far-flung communities together. And modern caravans and lorries have largely replaced the painted wagons visitors would have seen 30 years ago. Horses may be less useful these days, but they are vitally important to Gypsy families, from the Cotswolds to the Carpathians. </p> <p>Pride of place among the horses are skewbald and piebald cobs. They are robust horses that have been used by travellers for hundreds of years. Renowned for their good temperament, strength and versatility, they can be recognised by their distinctive black and brown and white markings, and their hairy, \"feathered\" feet. At fairs, travellers often shampoo and backcomb the feathers into a bush of hair that would turn Tina Turner green with envy. </p> <p>Tomorrow, in Stow, police permitting, Gypsy men and boys will show off their horsemanship as they have done for hundreds of years. They will ride and drive horses throughout the crowd without warning, scattering spectators everywhere. The chaos that follows might seem more suited to the streets of Spain than the quiet lanes of the Cotswolds, Kent or Cumbria, but England's increasingly sterile countryside would be a poorer place without it. </p> <p> <strong> Jake Bowers is a Romani</strong></p>",
  "<p>An ordinary Thursday, a month ago. Every second between midnight and midnight a woman called the police for protection from her partner. Those women were being bashed, stabbed, cut, kicked, slapped or \"just\" terrorised and intimidated. Very few of their assailants were arrested. </p> <p>This was September 28 in Britain. It was a snapshot of everyday violence published today by Professor Betsy Stanko, director of the Violence Research Project, based on reports to all police services, Victim Support, Women's Aid and Refuge, and Relate. </p> <p>Relate's evidence is a stiff challenge to the notion that domestic violence is the sport of the rough and unrespectable: nearly a fifth of clients on September 28 mentioned domestic violence. So, it happens in middle-class middle England. </p> <p>Multiply September 28 by evey day and you come up with more than half a million incidents - 80% of these calls were by women being attacked by their men. But the problem with the response to this mayhem is that these incidents are treated as just that, incidents. Just like the 3m-plus incidents of violence last year recorded in the British Crime Survey. </p> <p>Which no doubt enourages the prime minister and the home secretary to promise to get tough on brawling \"louts\" and \"yobs\", as if they were talking about a species other than themselves and a landscape that might as well be another planet. </p> <p>Despite a promise to invest more in preventing domestic violence, the shelters and self-help systems built by the women's movement are resource-starved. Despite their accumulated wisdom - reinforced by two decades of research showing that these incidents belong to a context and a relationship at the centre of which is the drama of gendered dominion and defeat - the Home Office is determined to dissemble the evidence. </p> <p>The government says it will get tough, but it avoids saying anything sensible about the problem - the perpetrator. If we don't know what violence is for then we won't know how dangerous it is and how to prevent it. It is only misogyny that determines this government's resistance to what is obvious. </p> <p>The government is wrong to think, as it does, that domestic violence is about women's experience of harm and humiliation and that doing something means being nicer to women. </p> <p>The lesson is that like communities menaced by posses of lads or young men being attacked in public places by other young men are just like women - they have all had to put up with passive and pessimistic policing and a Home Office determined to make masculinity-as-mastery the problem with no name. </p> <p>The Home Office should treat domestic violence not as the exception but as the paradigm. That would focus minds on the inescapable correlation between gender and violence - whoever the victims are, the perpetrators are overwhelmingly men. And it would address the inertia and indifference which meets not only domestic violence, but all violence, whether the victims are women, or other men. </p> <p>Violence is like the means to make war; it is a resource. It is not about losing control - men's usual excuse - it is about taking control. Violence is about conquest. And as the Australian academic Robert Connell insists, violence, like crime and war, is a context for making masculinity. Violence happens because someone wants to hurt someone else - because of their gender, their generation or their race. </p> <p>\"Domestic violence has been dismissed as relatively trivial,\" says Stanko. \"We have thought of it as a short-circuit of someone's individual mind. But when you look at domestic violence you see that it is more about gender than it is about individuals, it is a social problem with deep rooted meanings.\" </p> <p>A project involving domestic violence researchers and the police in West Yorkshire revealed an unpredictable response. Most calls weren't recorded by the police. But once they began to respond to domestic violence like other repeat offending, to treat it as a targeted hotspot, things started to change. </p> <p> By providing the victims with a range of services - from something as simple as a letter from the police to the perpetrator and the victim, to sanctioned vigilance among chosen neighbours, to police drive-by's and attendance, which shifted the burden of responding from the victim to the statutory services - the repeated offending reduced. By being active and persistant they created change. </p> <p>The government says it will get tough on violence, but it won't say anything sensible about the problem - the perpetrator. Domestic violence tells us who does it and why. It is only misogyny that determines this government's resistance to what is obvious. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:beejaysway@dial.pipex.com\">beejaysway@dial.pipex.com</a></p>",
  "Passengers should expect \"an extremely difficult week\" after a huge section of a London-Scotland main line route was closed for safety checks, Railtrack chief executive Gerald Corbett warned today. <p>The company gave only a few hours' notice that it was closing the line between Gretna, on the Scottish border, and Law junction, south of Glasgow. </p> <p>There are also further delays in the west country after the Great Western train company introduced a temporary timetable following the introduction of speed restrictions after last week's Hatfield derailment.

  "<p>A \u00a320m research fund designed to encourage links between academics and industry is set to be abolished following a report concluding that the six-year scheme has had little impact on universities.</p> <p>The higher education funding council for England is expected to scrap its 'generic research' fund after consultants found that the grants have had little success in promoting more university-industry collaborations. </p> <p>The council established the fund in 1994 in response to the previous year's white paper on science that made wealth creation and industrial application a priority for government sponsored projects. </p> <p>To qualify for grants, universities needed to retain the intellectual property rights to any marketable discoveries associated with collaborations and also retain the right to publish their findings in academic journals. </p> <p>The size of grants was allocated in proportion to the amount of money attracted by institutions through such collaborations.

  "It is a measure of Al Gore's increasing desperation that he is spending his time this week not in the big \"swing\" states which deliver dozens of votes in the electoral college, but rather in small states hitherto regarded as unswervingly for the Democrat cause. <p>One such is West Virginia, which has voted for Republican candidates only twice since 1960.

  "<p><strong>West Indies</strong></p> <p> The <strong> Windward Islands </strong> won their first Red Stripe Bowl since 1989 after defeating the <strong> Leeward Islands </strong> by five wickets in the final at Sabina Park, Kingston. In a slightly disappointing finale to the competition, the Leeward Islands elected to bat after winning the toss, and reached 61 without loss in the 19th over, thanks to <strong> Wilden Cornwall</strong>, who finished with 53, and <strong> Stuart Williams </strong> (28). It was all downhill from there, though, as this turned out to be easily the highest partnership of the match. The Leewards collapsed to 109-7 before scraping their way to 163-8 off their 50 overs, thanks to a late 28 from captain <strong> Ridley Jacobs</strong>. <strong> Rawl Lewis </strong> was the best of an effective, if hardly spectacular, Windwards attack with 3-31. The Windwards started confidently but were struggling at 55-3 before <strong> Junior Murray </strong> (30), named Man of the Series, put on a quick 31 with <strong> John Eugene </strong> (13). They were followed by their captain Lewis (23*) and <strong> Roy Marshall</strong>, who top-scored for the Windwards with 36*. These two played sensibly to ease their side home with more than seven overs to spare.</p> <p><strong> Leeward Islands* </strong> 163-8 (50 overs)<br> <strong> Windward Islands </strong> 164-5 (42.5 overs)<br> <strong> Windward Islands won by 5 wickets </strong> </p> <p> Earlier, in a semi-final notable for poor batting on both sides, the <strong> Leeward Islands </strong> had beaten <strong> Barbados </strong> by 13 runs to advance to their fourth consecutive final. After being asked to bat the Leewards tottered to 169 all out, the only significant contribution coming from a seventh-wicket partnership between wicketkeeper-captain <strong> Ridley Jacobs </strong> (44) and <strong> Carl Tuckett </strong> (39). One-time West Indies one-day player <strong> Hendy Bryan </strong> took 3-25. With a required run-rate of only 3.4 Barbados should have had the match under control, but it was not to be. Wickets fell regularly as they slumped to 156 all out, with <strong> Wilden Cornwall </strong> taking 3-25.</p> <p><strong> Leeward Islands </strong> 169 (49.5 overs)<br> <strong> Barbados* </strong> 156 (48.4 overs)<br> <strong> Leeward Islands won by 13 runs </strong> </p> <p>Under-par batting was also a feature of the second semi-final, which had resulted in a four-wicket win for the <strong> Windward Islands</strong> over <strong> Jamaica</strong>. After winning the toss Jamaican captain <strong> Jimmy Adams </strong> elected to bat, a decision which soon backfired as his side collapsed to 9-3 after 7 overs. Jamaica were forced to struggle for every run against some fine bowling, particularly from <strong> Nixon McLean </strong> (4-28), and eventually reached 187-9. <strong> Marlon Samuels </strong> (52) was the only player to get past 20. In reply the Windward Islands lost wickets regularly but never looked in serious trouble as they overhauled their target in the 49th over. Their major scorers were <strong> John Eugene </strong> (44*) and <strong> Junior Murray </strong> (42).</p> <p><strong> Jamaica* </strong> 187-9 (50 overs)<br> <strong> Windward Islands </strong> 191-6 (48.2 overs)<br> <strong> Windward Islands won by 4 wickets </strong> </p> <p> There were no shocks in the final set of group matches. Following their amazing defeat of <strong> Barbados</strong>, the <strong> USA </strong> capitulated to 62 all out against <strong> Trinidad and Tobago</strong>, who took only 5.1 overs to reach their target. The <strong> Cayman Islands </strong> were the only team in the competition to finish with no points, following their six-wicket defeat by the <strong> Windward Islands</strong>. After a scare in which they lost their last six wickets for 41 runs, all to <strong> Davis Joseph</strong>, <strong> Jamaica </strong> easily overcame <strong> Canada </strong> by 91 runs.</p> <p><strong> USA </strong> 62 (35.2 overs)<br> <strong> Trinidad and Tobago* </strong> 65-1 (5.1 overs)<br> <strong> Trinidad and Tobago won by 9 wickets </strong> </p> <p><strong> Cayman Islands* </strong> 103 (43.1 overs)<br> <strong> Windward Islands </strong> 104-4 (24 overs)<br> <strong> Windward Islands won by 6 wickets </strong> </p> <p><strong> Jamaica* </strong> 226 (50 overs)<br> <strong> Canada </strong> 135 (46.3 overs)<br> <strong> Jamaica won by 91 runs </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Pakistan </strong> </p> <p><strong> Gujranwala </strong> scraped their way past a modest target to defeat <strong> Lahore Blues </strong> in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy Grade I at the LCCA Ground in Lahore. Needing just 175 in their second innings, the Gujranwala openers got off to a brisk start with a partnership of 58 between <strong> Imran Abbas </strong> (26) and debutant <strong> Attiq-ur-Rehman </strong> (36), but were reduced to 108-6 before <strong> Asim Munir </strong> (30*) and <strong> Kamran Younas </strong> (23) steered them out of trouble. <strong> Lahore Blues </strong> had previously been dismissed for 179 and 212, the highlight of their second innings being a patient 73 from <strong> Farid Butt</strong>. After being reduced to 120-5, Gujranwala made 217 in their first innings with left-arm spinner <strong> Mohammad Hussain </strong> taking 5-54.</p> <p><strong> Lahore Blues* </strong> 179 and 212 (Farid Butt 73, Sarfraz Ahmed 5-36)<br> <strong> Gujranwala </strong> 217 (Mohammad Hussain 5-54) and 177-7 <br> <strong> Gujranwala won by 3 wickets</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Faisalabad's </strong> draw with <strong> Sargodha </strong> was enlivened by an extraordinary batting display by <strong> Mohammad Ramuzan</strong>.

McKenzie shared a South African domestic record partnership of 181 for the 4th wicket with Northerns captain <strong> Gerald Dros </strong> (86), who also picked up 3-52 in the North West innings. <strong> Greg Smith</strong>, a left-arm pace bowler who recently signed for <strong> Nottinghamshire</strong>, also picked up three wickets as NW struggled to 210 in reply, the only resistance coming via a sixth-wicket partnership of 86 between <strong> Thinus Enslin </strong> (52) and West Indian <strong> Mark Lavine</strong>, who bludgeoned his way to 63 off 56 balls, including three fours and six sixes.</p> <p><strong> Northerns </strong> 239-5 (45 overs)<br> <strong> North West </strong> 210-7 (45 overs)<br> <strong> Northerns won by 29 runs </strong> </p> <p> Fast bowler <strong> Alan Dawson </strong> recorded career-best figures of 5-13 as Western Province thrashed Griqualand West by 144 runs in Kimberley. He ran through the batting line-up as GW crumbled to 85 all out, a total which could have been worse had it not been for the last-wicket stand of 42 between <strong> Adri Swanepol </strong> (16) and <strong> Deon Kruis</strong>, GW's top scorer with 28 not out. Earlier <strong> Herschelle Gibbs</strong>, currently banned from international cricket for his part in the Hansie Cronje match-fixing scandal, scored 71 for WP, sharing an opening partnership of 119 with <strong> Gary Kirsten </strong> (51) to set up their win.</p> <p><strong> Western Province </strong> 229-7 (45 overs)<br> <strong> Griqualand West* </strong> 85 (36.3 overs)<br> <strong> Western Province won by 144 runs </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Eastern Province </strong> went to the top of the table with a thrilling six-run win over <strong> Border </strong> at Buffalo Park. Batting first, they made 260-3 off their 45 overs, with substantial contributions from the top three of <strong> Carl Bradfield</strong> (91), <strong> Mark Benfield </strong> (50) and <strong> James Bryant </strong> (62). In reply Border looked to have judged their run-chase perfectly as <strong> Laden Gamiet </strong> (57), <strong> Ian Mitchell </strong> (53) and <strong> Craig Sugden </strong> (84) kept up with the required rate. However, in a late collapse they lost their last six wickets for 22 and their last four for five, thanks to some fine bowling form <strong> Nantie Hayward</strong>, who picked up three wickets with his well-disguised slower ball.</p> <p><strong> Eastern Province </strong> 260-3 (45 overs)<br> <strong> Border* </strong> 254 (43.5 overs)<br> <strong> Eastern Province won by 6 runs </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Sven Koenig </strong> almost single-handedly saved <strong> Gauteng </strong> from defeat in the first game of the first-class SuperSport Series against <strong> Griqualand West </strong> in Johannesburg. He made 94 in his side's dismal first-innings display and then followed it up with 108 in their second innings to save the game. Griqualand had notched up 427-4 in their first innings, with a career-best 165 from <strong> Mickey Arthur </strong> which included one six and 27 fours. He put on a club record first-wicket partnership of 254 with <strong> Martin Gidley </strong> (86), and they were backed up by <strong> Pieter Koortzen </strong> (82*) and <strong> Wendell Bossenger </strong> (72*). In reply Gauteng crumbled to 184 all out, with Koenig scoring more than half the runs. Legspinner <strong> Craig Copeland </strong> was the chief destroyer for GW, taking 5-52. After being asked to follow on, Koenig looked to be all that was standing between Gauteng and an embarrassing defeat against last year's wooden-spoonists, and he replied by scoring 108, his fifth first-class century, while occupying the crease for a shade over six hours. This time around he was backed up by useful 20s and 30s from the middle and lower order as the match drifted towards a draw.</p> <p><strong> Griqualand West </strong> 427-4 dec <br> <strong> Gauteng </strong> 184 and 384-9 <br> <strong> Match drawn. Griqualand West 7pts, Gauteng 2pts </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Australia </strong> </p> <p>A powerful 91 not out off 92 balls from captain <strong> Darren Lehmann </strong> was not enough to gain the points for <strong> South Australia </strong> in their closely-fought Mercantile Mutual Cup game against <strong> Western Australia </strong> at the WACA. Lehmann was the major contributor for SA but had to watch from the non-striker's end as <strong> Brad Young </strong> failed to score the four runs needed to win the game off the last ball, instead spooning a catch to WA captain <strong> Tom Moody </strong> off fast bowler <strong> Brad Williams</strong>. In a match reduced to 44 overs after a delayed start due to a damp outfield, the WA innings was anchored by a partnership of 103 between <strong> Simon Katich </strong> (69) and <strong> Murray Goodwin </strong> (62*), making his first appearance for WA following his retirement from the Zimbabwe national team. They steered WA away from the precarious position of 68-3 but were helped by some poor fielding from SA - Katich was dropped on 4 and Goodwin on 20. The WA fielding was much better, with <strong> Damien Martyn </strong> and <strong> Brad Hogg </strong> each holding on to spectacular catches.</p> <p><strong> Western Australia* </strong> 233-5 (44 overs)<br> <strong> South Australia </strong> 230-6 (44 overs)<br> <strong> Western Australia won by 3 runs </strong> </p> <p> Under-fire <strong> Mark Waugh </strong> gave the Australian selectors something to think about with an unbeaten century in <strong> New South Wales's</strong> win over <strong> Queensland </strong> at Sydney's Bankstown Oval, his home ground. He hit 108* as a star-studded NSW side easily reached their target of 248 with 16 balls and 7 wickets to spare. His innings included 11 boundaries, and he was ably supported by <strong> Michael Bevan </strong> (51*), and his <strong> brother Steve </strong> who made a run-a-ball 49. Earlier Queensland had won the toss and elected to bat against a strong NSW bowling attack. <strong> Martin Love </strong> contributed 82, including seven fours and three sixes, backed up by <strong> Jimmy Maher </strong> (48). For the second match in a row <strong> Glenn McGrath </strong> ended wicketless, the damage being done by his new-ball partner <strong> Brett Lee </strong> (3-54) and the under-rated <strong> Stuart MacGill </strong>, who took 3-44.</p> <p><strong> Queensland* </strong> 247-9 (50 overs)<br> <strong> New South Wales </strong> 251-3 (47.4 overs)<br> <strong> New South Wales won by 7 wickets </strong> </p> <p><em>Catherine Hanley is an Australian who supports Somerset but lives and works in Sheffield.

  "<p><strong>THE CASE OF THE EXECUTED FOOTBALLER</strong></p> <p>\"Is it true that a winner of a Cup Final medal was hung for sheep stealing in Australia in the early 1900s? I was told that it was an ex-Everton player,\" asked James Carlin a few weeks back.</p> <p>Last week, we suggested that Goodison legend Sandy Young was indeed hung for this heinous crime - a fact once backed up on TV by goody-two-shoes presenter Gary Lineker. But Geir Juva has evidence that Young was imprisoned - and not executed - for far more wayward ways:</p> <p>\"Young played for Tottenham for a few months in 1911, and I found the following in Bob Goodwin's excellent Who's Who of Tottenham Hotspur:</p> <p>'... [Young] had a year with South Liverpool before emigrating to Australia in 1914. In December 1915, Young was charged with the wilful murder of his brother and, in June 1916, was found guilty of manslaughter, evidence having been produced from football officials in England that during his playing career he had been subject to fits of temporary insanity. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment but was not released immediately on completion of his sentence but kept in custody on the grounds of 'mental weakness' and it was some time before he returned home to Scotland...'</p> <p>\"Young died on 17 September 1959 in Portobello, Edinburgh. A belated booking for Mr Lineker?\"</p> <p><strong>THE GREEDY GOALSCORER</strong></p> <p>\"How is it possible for a player to score two goals in a match without anyone else touching the ball in between?\" asked Mad Dan Eccles.</p> <p>Many of you wrote in to explain to the insane Mr Eccles that this feat can be achieved by first scoring an own goal and then shooting and scoring directly from the resulting kick-off. </p> <p>Some readers also pointed out that if this second goal was the last kick of the first half, and the scorer's team was due to restart the second period, a third could be scored without another soul touching the hallowed sphere.</p> <p><strong>SOCIALIST FOOTBALLERS (PART 4 IN A SERIES)</strong></p> <p>Tony Galvin, Chris Houghton, Brian McClair, Bill Shankly, Alex Ferguson, Diego Maradona, Jorge Valdano, Fernando Redondo, Pep Guardiola, Paul Breitner, Niall Quinn and Egil Olsen have all been cited as socialists (of varying degrees) during recent editions of Knowledge Unlimited. But are there any more out there?</p> <p>\"It was widely rumoured around Liverpool that some ideological differences had led to fisticuffs at Everton's Bellefield training ground between Ian Snodin - representing the Yorkshire Miners and the NUM - and Neil Pointon, son of a Nottinghamshire miner, representing the NUDM,\" suggests Ian Roberts.</p> <p><strong>ASTON VILLA - WHY?</strong></p> <p>\"Where does the Villa in Aston Villa come from? Does it have anything to do with the Aston-Martin motorcar?\" asked Bob Hobbs last week.</p> <p>\"Aston-Martin motorcar? Maybe it's because they play in Aston. That's probably also why the Aston Expressway is called the Aston Expressway - because it's in Aston, and it's an Expressway!\" rants an incredulous Algy. </p> <p>To be fair, Algy does offer something rather more constructive: \"Villa I'm guessing that it's Aston Hall, which overlooked the Aston Lower Grounds before Villa Park was placed there in 1897.\"</p> <p>For a while, we were convinced. Until Martin Blogg quoted us a line or two from \"stadium guru\" Simon Inglis' historical tome Villa Park 100 Years, that is:</p> <p>\"Aston Villa Football Club was founded by pupils of the Aston Villa Wesleyan Chapel Sunday school. The Chapel was in an area of Aston known as Aston Villa, after an 18th-century house of the same name.\"</p> <p>So there you go. Now, Queens Park Rangers what's that all about, then?</p> <p><strong>WHY WEREN'T PAISLEY, CLOUGH AND BARTON KNIGHTED - WHEN BUSBY AND FERGIE WERE?</strong></p> <p>\"Why wasn't Bob Paisley knighted?\" asked Mark Aspinall. \"After all, he did win leagues and European Cups with Liverpool, making them the first English team to dominate Europe for a number of years. Nor was Clough knighted for achieving two consecutive European Cups on a more modest budget with Forest, or Tony Barton for winning the European Cup with Villa. Yet both Matt Busby and Alex Ferguson were knighted. Why?\" \"The reason why Paisley, Clough and Barton were not knighted whilst Ferguson and Busby were? Simple - to upset people like you!\" writes Kevin Richards from guess where.</p> <p><strong>CLUBS ON CELLULOID - AGAIN</strong></p> <p>\"In This is Spinal Tap, the bassist Derek Smalls can be seen to be wearing an early-80s Shrewsbury Town shirt. Have there been other incidences of silver screen glory for the lower league clubs?\" asks James McKie.</p> <p>\"Speaking of Derek Smalls in his Shrewsbury shirt, only a true Tap obsessive will have spotted David St Hubbins's favourite team: Wolverhampton Wanderers,\" says Stephen Buckland, going one louder. \"As the band arrive in New York for their very first gig, the guitarist and vocalist can be seen sporting the familiar gold and black scarf behind manager Ian Faith. It's only a few frames, but it's there. Buy the video, folks.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, John Dobson says that Swansea got \"quite an airing\" in piss-poor British flick Twin Town: \"The Lewis twins wore Swansea shirts for most of the film and ran amok through the streets of the city singing 'I was born under a Swansea star'.\"</p> <p><strong>CAN YOU HELP?</strong></p> <p>\"Did David Beckham and Posh Spice ever elaborate on where in Brooklyn they conceived their son? Much as I love the borough, it's not exactly littered with flash hotels and Armani boutiques. Maybe they were just too embarrassed to name a son 'Manhattan'?\" asks Sean Cronin of Brooklyn.</p> <p>\"Regarding Paul Worrall's question (30 August) concerning the stars on certain team badges,\" says Greg Whitaker. \"If gold stars on team badges are awarded for teams who have won the World Cup or ten Scudettos, can anyone explain to me why Manchester City should have three gold stars on their latest club badge? Is it perhaps one for every decade they have gone since winning the league?\"</p> <p>\"I have heard that only three players have scored 30 league goals against Liverpool - Dixie Dean, Jimmy Greaves and the classic Emlyn Hughes bringing up the rear with an astounding 30 own goals. Is this true?\" asks John Ames.</p> <p>\"There have been some dodgy colour combinations coming out of the team kit bag over the years,\" opines Rob Hancock.

In the earliest stages of intoxication, the will power is destroyed and inhibitions and restraints are released; the moral barricades are broken down and often debauchery and sexuality result. Where mental instability is inherent, the behaviour is generally violent. An egotist will enjoy delusions of grandeur, the timid individual will suffer anxiety, and the aggressive one often will resort to acts of violence and crime. Dormant tendencies are released . . . Constant use produces an incapacity for work and a disorientation . . . often leading to insanity after prolonged use.</p> <p>Anslinger's claims have been endorsed by high officials ever since. \"There is not a shred of scientific evidence that shows that smoked marijuana is useful or needed,\" declared the former US drugs czar General Barry McCaffrey in 1996. \"This is not a medicine. This is a cruel hoax.\" Our own home secretary endorsed this line after his son's arrest for a drug offence in 1997. Ann 'zero-tolerance' Widdecombe is even more opposed to it (except, it seems, when used by shadow cabinet colleagues and other supposedly 'educated, articulate people').</p> <p>Anslinger was lying. In The Science of Marijuana, Leslie Iversen has produced the most authoritative and up-to-date scientific assessment of the medical uses of cannabis now available. He recalls that cannabis was recommended for the treatment of constipation, gout, malaria, rheumatism and menstrual problems in a Chinese compendium of herbal medicines published around 2800 BC. It was a medicament in many subsequent cultures. Difficulties in standardising cannabis preparations meant, however, that it was not widely used in 19th-century western medicine. Even so, in 1937, when its medical use was suppressed in the US, there were 28 different medicines in which it was an ingredient. In 1964 came confirmation that virtually all the pharmacological activity in hashish extracts is attributable to one compound, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Later, the existence of specific receptors for cannabinoids in the brain and other tissues was established.</p> <p>Early in the 1970s the US Drugs Enforcement Agency was petitioned to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug which could be prescribed by physicians. Finally, in 1986, after prolonged legal tussles, the DEA agreed to public hearings on the petition. The hearings lasted for more than two years. Despite the DEA's legal expert recommending the rescheduling, and his conclusion that cannabis is \"one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man\", the DEA denied the petition. Iversen refers to a 1990 finding that 44 per cent of US oncologists had suggested that a patient smoke marijuana for relief of the nausea induced by chemotherapy. If the drug were really unsafe for use even under medical supervision, as its Schedule I status affirms, this recommendation would have been unthinkable.</p> <p>Despite the DEA's obstruction, the discovery of the cannabinoid control system in the body has revitalised scientific research. Two synthetic cannabinoids have become available on prescription to patients in Europe and the US. The annual sales of dronabil (sold under the trade name of Marinol) in the US are estimated to be worth about $20 million: some 80 per cent of prescriptions are as an appetite stimulant for people with Aids or HIV, 10 per cent to counteract the nausea associated with chemotherapy and 10 per cent for other purposes. The Eli Lilly Company has developed nabilone: under the trade name of Cesamet it, too, is used to treat nausea in patients undergoing chemotherapy, although it also gave promising results in clinical trials in the treatment of anxiety. In addition, many patients with multiple sclerosis have reported benefiting from smoking cannabis. The possibility of its use in the treatment of glaucoma and epilepsy is being looked into.</p> <p>During 1997, the American Medical Association recommended controlled clinical trials on the medical uses of smoked marijuana, and the BMA recommended trials of synthetic cannabinoids. The House of Lords Science and Technology Committee reported in 1998 that more clinical research was needed, but recommended the drug's rescheduling to permit its medical use. A year later, the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine urged that its therapeutic use in pain relief, control of nausea and appetite stimulation be further investigated. New clinical trials will probably soon be underway in Europe and the US, and I don't doubt from the evidence laid out by Iversen that they will yield positive data. It will then be hard for governments to refuse approval for the medical use of cannabis or cannabinoids. </p> <p>\"The argument that approval of the medical use of cannabis would be tantamount to encouraging the legalisation of the drug for all purposes is clearly specious,\" Iversen concludes, \"and is no justification for withholding an effective medicine from patients who need it.\" Such ideas were anathema to the egregious McCaffrey. \"There could be no worse message to young people,\" he insisted. \"Just when the nation is trying its hardest to educate teenagers not to use psychoactive drugs . . . they are being told that marijuana is a medicine.\"</p> <p>Many other psychoactive drugs have a recognised place in European medicine notwithstanding the dangers of misuse. Heroin is the foremost example. Despite Congressman Stephen Porter's disastrous Act of 1924 prohibiting its medical use in the US, European countries resisted postwar American pressure (directed through the United Nations) to impose this ban globally. An attempt under the Eden Government in 1955 to prohibit its medical use in Britain was defeated by a House of Lords rebellion led by the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Jowitt, supported by a number of medical peers.</p> <p>One of the virtues of William McAllister's meticulously researched history of 20th-century drugs diplomacy is to highlight the source of most national drug regulatory systems in the series of international conferences on the subject held since 1912. Summaries of diplomatic proceedings, or of the Conventions they produce, can make dry reading, but McAllister brings a wry humour to his subject. The book is indispensable to understanding the drug controls and policing of the world in 2000; among many rich details, it gives disturbing insights into the influence of pharmaceutical companies on global policy. At the crucial Conference on Psychotropic Substances held in Vienna in 1971, several key delegations, including the US delegation, were infiltrated by company executives defending their freedom to sell amphetamines and barbiturates with minimal regulation. The mystery as to why the spokesman for six Latin American countries opposing tight regulations spoke only broken Spanish was solved when he was discovered to be a Swiss employee of Hoffman-LaRoche.</p> <p>McAllister's is an international history, drawing on diplomatic archives: he does not go into detail on the home office's troubled relations with cannabis. The home office first took notice of what was then known as Indian hemp in 1922, when it was sent a substance found in the coalshed of an Egyptian coffee-house keeper in South Shields. The home office confirmed to the chief constable that on analysis the substance proved to be 'hasheesh', which was not covered by the Dangerous Drugs Act (DDA) of 1920. Next, in 1923, ten tons of cannabis resin en route from Bombay to Djibouti were detained: the shipper was Henri de Monfreid, whose memoir La Croisiere du Hachich (1935) - in English translation, Hashish: A Traveller's Tale (1994) - is a splendid introduction to the subject of trafficking and drugs regulations. The home office was consulted before Monfreid's shipment was allowed to proceed. Shortly afterwards, two waiters, one Italian and the other Sudanese, were arrested in Old Compton Street and accused of offering to supply raw opium. In fact, the brown substance in their possession was hashish, which it was then legal to possess, and the case was abandoned. But it provided the excuse for an alarmist series of cheap newspaper articles in the silly season - including a supposed interview in the Daily Mail with a home office official - in the relevant file in the Public Record Office the official in question has written the word 'Liar!' in the margin. On the strength of the hoo-ha metropolitan police recommended the incorporation of cannabis in the Dangerous Drugs Act, one CID officer advising that cannabis \"has practically the same effect as cocaine and morphine upon its victims\". </p> <p>Even the Met was not optimistic about the success of prohibition: the \"only result\" of prohibiting the drug in Egypt had been \"an increase of price to its consumers\". The home office did not want to legislate, but foresaw that \"the prevalence of the vice in Egypt\" - despite prohibition there - might result in 'international regulation of the drug'. This was prescient. A month later, the Egyptian ministry of the interior concluded that as it was \"practically impossible to keep hashish out of Egypt . . . the League of Nations should consider hashish as an international affair and should try to persuade its members to make dealing in or consuming the drug a crime punishable by severe penalties.\"</p> <p>Consequently, at the Geneva Conference on Opium of 1924-25, Egypt's delegate proposed bringing hashish within the Hague Convention of 1912. His memorandum, circulated to support this proposal, represented it as \"a dangerous narcotic . . . more harmful than opium\", and stated that \"about 70 per cent of insane people in lunatic asylums in Egypt are haschiche eaters or smokers.\" Congressman Porter, the monomaniacal leader of the US delegation, was keen on this initiative. \"We are asking them to help us to destroy the vice of opium, coca leaves and their derivatives,\" he declared of the Egyptians. \"This is a good time to practise a little reciprocity. They have their troubles and we have ours.\"</p> <p>The contracting powers at the Geneva Conference accordingly agreed in 1925 to prohibit the import and export of Indian hemp except for certified medical or scientific purposes. In Britain, cannabis was immediately rescheduled as a poison, with effect from April 1925. A few months later, a new DDA brought Britain into line for the ratification of the Geneva Convention. The House of Commons debate on the Bill lasted less than five minutes: Indian hemp, or cannabis, was not mentioned once. The House of Lords debate was slightly longer. Peers followed the advice of Lord Haldane that, as it was \"impossible to form any judgment on the details of the Bill\", it should \"be taken by the House to a large extent on trust\". It was on this slipshod basis that cannabis was criminalised.</p> <p>This might not have mattered much had it not been for the enduring effects of Prohibition in the US. Cannabis was listed in the US Pharmacopoeia as a recognised medicine from 1850 until 1942. It was sold cheaply by drugstores in the form of fluid extracts, and was smoked in cigarette form by asthmatics. Between 1900 and 1920 it began to be used on a limited scale as a recreational drug by immigrant labourers from Mexico and the Caribbean. Its consumption was enormously increased after the 18th Amendment - prohibiting alcohol - came into force in 1920. Alcohol became more difficult to obtain, more expensive and often of poor quality. In urban centres 'tea pads' operating like speakeasies provided cheap marijuana. In 1944, Mayor La Guardia's Committee on Marijuana estimated that there had been five hundred 'tea pads' in New York City by the 1930s.</p> <p>The mass marketing of marijuana for recreational use was the result of bad law-making. Congressman Porter's response to the Egyptians at Geneva showed that cannabis was not then regarded as a problem by anti-drugs propagandists in the US. It first received public attention in a series of sensationalised and false reports in the New Orleans press in 1926 involving drug-crazed black marijuana users and corrupted schoolchildren. By 1931, all but two states west of the Mississippi and several others in the East had made a criminal offence of the possession or use of cannabis. By 1937, every state had outlawed the drug under legislation allowing no distinction between physiologically addictive narcotics such as heroin, habit-forming stimulants like cocaine, and hallucinogens. Anslinger felt that his agents at the Bureau of Narcotics were overstretched coping with opiates without having to suppress a drug that could be easily grown in many states of the Union. He accepted then that \"the marijuana addict\" did not \"graduate into a heroin, an opium or a cocaine user\".</p> <p>Once he'd decided that he would have to submit to political pressure for a Federal law to be passed against marijuana, he did so in a manner calculated, not untypically, to strengthen his own position and that of the Bureau. He strenuously supported the Marijuana Tax Bill. \"How many murders, suicides, robberies, criminal assaults, hold-ups, burglaries and deeds of maniacal insanity it causes each year, especially among the young, can only be conjectured,\" he said, assuring the House of Representatives that under the influence of the drug, \"people will fly into a delirious rage and many will commit violent crimes.\" His corrupt rhetoric was contaminating. It produced such an atmosphere than when the official representative of the American Medical Association came to testify against the Bill, he was bullied and insulted. (An editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association of 1 May 1937 advised that \"the proposed Federal venture into the interstate control of cannabis hardly seems to be justified by experience . . . After more than twenty years of Federal effort and the expenditure of millions of dollars, the opium and cocaine habits are still widespread.\")</p> <p>Like Lord Haldane 12 years earlier in the House of Lords, Congressman Sam Rayburn assured Congress that \"this Bill has a unanimous report from the committee and there is no controversy about it.\" When asked what the Bill was about, he added, vaguely: \"it has something to do with something that is called marijuana. I believe it is a narcotic of some kind.\" The Bill passed after less than half an hour's debate. If a good law is one that reduces misconduct, while a bad law results in increased infractions, then the Marijuana Tax Act was calamitous. It raises the question that is too seldom addressed when considering policy on drugs: does social deviance lead to social controls, or do such controls result in deviance? In the five years after 1937, about sixty thousand tons of marijuana were destroyed in the US and about a thousand people arrested annually for violating the law. The number of arrests in California rose from 1156 in 1954 to 50,327 in 1968. By 1998, there were 695,000 arrests annually in the US: 86,086 was the comparable figure for Britain in 1997. The policing of cannabis accounted for nearly 80 per cent of police time spent on drug offences in both countries.</p> <p>The DEA has grown into a second international intelligence agency, with a global network of agents rivalling that of the CIA. The total spent on the War on Drugs rose from $537m in 1980 to $1.2bn in 1984. By 1991, the Government was spending $7.7bn on action against illegal intoxicants. Despite the deployment of all these repressive instruments, the US has failed to disrupt the dynamics of prohibition and illegal supply. As the late Jan-Willem Gerritsen writes in his perceptive study of prohibition policies, \"the high 'business risks' keep prices high and guarantee good profit margins for successful entrepreneurs, so that the market continues to exercise tremendous magnetic appeal.\" Although \"increasingly stiff sentences imposed under the criminal law aggravate the risks on the supply side, they also boost the market position of those able to evade prosecution. The harsher the repressive measures, the greater the reward for successful entrepreneurs, who have every reason to expand their market and increase the volume of their supply.\"</p> <p>Such reasonable observations are anathema to the prohibitionists. Anslinger moved ruthlessly and mendaciously to discredit the authoritative medical and scientific report commissioned by La Guardia. His agents would have been equally hostile to Iversen, who in his temperate and understated book regrets that cannabis \"has rarely been regarded simply as a substance with effects and side effects\". Instead, it \"has been equated with morality and the debate about its use portrayed as one of good versus evil. Marijuana has been linked with the pursuit of pleasure and with idleness rather than the work ethic.\" Most scientists believe that the grave short-term risks attributed to cannabis \"were grossly exaggerated\", but neither scientists nor anyone else can prove the effect of a substance to be non-existent; it is therefore impossible to prove that any substance is harmless. Most mental effects of cannabis are potential rather than inherent; the potential physical effects cannot be assessed without much more data on long-term consumption. While it is less habit-forming than heroin, nicotine and cocaine, Iversen postulates that \"as many as 10% of regular users will become dependent on the drug.\" Current recreational use of cannabis has less adverse effect on public health than either tobacco or alcohol, but it is likely \"that an increased use of cannabis would bring an increased public health impact\".</p> <p>The profits from trafficking in illegal intoxicants are always 'black': they fall outside the supervision and authority of governments. As Gerritsen argues, 'since a country's sovereignty stands or falls with its monopoly on taxation and the obligation of its citizens to pay taxes, the illegal drugs trade forms a fundamental threat to the system of national states.' Since 1985, under the insistent leadership of the US, there has been a concerted campaign to control the international laundering of black-market money derived from drugs. This aspect of the war on drugs, he writes, is leading 'to something that was never intended: a uniform global regulatory regime, which will be applicable to all types of financial service'.</p> <p>Gerritsen's sociological history charts the way 20th-century controls on drugs were used to defend social norms. Men like Anslinger, who was obsessed with Red China, and Richard Nixon, who revived the widespread use of cocaine by his maladroit War on Drugs, regarded their sale and use as a collective threat from outsiders. The 'silent majority' (a phrase Nixon borrowed from Homer, who was referring to the dead) refused to acknowledge that prohibitionist legislation and its enforcement are indispensable preconditions for the growth of illicit supply. \"In a repressive climate of this kind, more informal modes of regulation - which certainly exist among users - are by definition confined to a twilight subculture that is a natural breeding ground for crime and other expressions of counter-culture,\" Gerritsen writes.</p> <p>This is one of the quandaries addressed by the Police Foundation inquiry into the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The members of this committee (chaired by Lady Runciman) are essentially pragmatic:</p> <p>It has become inescapably clear to us that the eradication of drug use is not achievable and it is not therefore either a realistic or a sensible goal of public policy. The main aim of the law must be to control and limit the demand for and the supply of illicit drugs in order to minimise the serious individual and social harms caused by their use.</p> <p>Rather than react to the bullying of journalists, drugs laws should reflect the latest scientific understanding; they should also \"be accepted by the public as fair, consistent, enforceable, consistent and just\". As to social attitudes, the Mori survey commissioned by Runciman showed that tobacco and alcohol were considered more harmful than cannabis by every age group. Illegal drug use remained a minority pursuit well after the 1960s. But by the late 1990s, the majority of people aged between 16 and 29 admitted to having tried illegal drugs; the estimate is that up to one third of this group may have used cannabis or other drugs within the last year. Cannabis accounted for between 70 and 85 per cent of all offences under the MDA, of which there were more than 110,000 in 1997.</p> <p>The best chance of formulating a workable policy lies in viewing drugs as commodities within a hugely lucrative, dynamic and expanding illicit economy. Forty years ago, before the reform of gambling laws, bookies' runners presented a major challenge to a bad law: they convinced the authorities that they would not go away, could not be suppressed and had better be regulated. The cannabis users of 2000 are in the same position as the off-course gamblers of 1960.</p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

  "<p>Carlton Communications yesterday completed a \u00a3181m deal with Granada Media to buy HTV, the south-west franchise, and to sell its 20% stake in south-eastern broadcaster Meridian. </p> <p>The deal, valued at \u00a3380m, marks the end of a year of consolidation among ITV companies and restores the balance of power at the network, with Granada and Carlton controlling 51% and 40% respectively. </p> <p>Analysts described it as being \"good for both parties\" and predicted it would pave the way for a single ITV company if legislation is introduced to change competition rules. </p> <p>The deal is effective immediately, although Granada will still control advertising in the last two months of the year. </p> <p>Granada, which retains control of HTV's Bristol-based production business, had to sell HTV to comply with the regulators after buying the television operations of United News &amp; Media for \u00a31.75bn in the summer. </p> <p>The arrangement will see it take full control of lucrative Meridian, while Carlton will have a large slice of ITV running from the midlands through to the south west. </p> <p>Steve Morrison, the chief executive of Granada Media, said the deal would strengthen the partnership between the two, especially regarding the running of ONdigital, its joint venture pay-TV operation. </p> <p>\"It was very important to do this quickly as we are at a stage in the year when companies plan their budgets,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I am very pleased that we have discharged our responsibilities to the staff and viewers.

  "Raymond Chandler was nearly 55 when he wrote his first Hollywood screenplay. The film was Double Indemnity, which Chandler adapted from the James M Cain novel and which starred Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray, becoming a classic film noir when it appeared in 1944. <p>Its director, Billy Wilder, remembered the unworldly Chandler arriving at the studio and asking to see what a script looked like.</p> <p>Times change. And this week, a group of Hollywood writers who claim they are discriminated against because of their age have launched a class action suit against the main networks, studios and agencies.</p> <p>The group of 28 screenwriters claims that there is a systematic pattern of discrimination against writers over a certain age, regardless of how talented and experienced they are.</p> <p>A survey by the Writers Guild of America, which is part of the evidence in the suit, showed that 75 per cent of writers aged 30 or under were employed during a year.

  "Declaring the end of an era, Italy has scrapped conscription to make way for a more professional army, leaving only a legacy of nostalgia, pride and cruel British jokes. <p>For Italians the army consigned to history yesterday was a source of unity, courage and honour, not laughter. The volunteer force that will take its place, giving women a military role for the first time, makes total sense. But its arrival was tinged with regret.</p> <p>A young, fractious country born only in 1861, Italy relied on conscription to forge a sense of nationhood by jumbling together southerners and northerners. For generations of Italians who did not even speak the same language, it succeeded.</p> <p>British schoolboys snigger at Benito Mussolini's incompetent forays into north Africa, and the switch to the Allies as the tide of the second world war changed, but Italians remember their army for other things.</p> <p>A ragtag, outnumbered force which united the country against the odds was its progenitor. In Alpine valleys it eventually hammered the Austrians and Germans in the first world war, losing 600,000 men in the process. It has been deployed in southern Italy and Sicily to counter terrorism and the mafia.</p> <p>In peacekeeping and relief operations in Lebanon, Namibia, East Timor and Kurdistan it has earned respect. It has shouldered much of Nato's burden in the Balkans. Not a slick killing machine, but one worthy of pride, reckon most Italians.</p> <p>Yet the senate voted overwhelmingly to abolish conscription, a procedure started two centuries ago by Napoleon Bonaparte. Over the next seven years the 270,000-strong force will shrink to 190,000 volunteers.</p> <p>Opposed only by the far-left Refounded Communists, the law is intended to boost the army's aptitude for peace-keeping. As well as short-term savings, an end to conscription means higher salaries, improved training and better equipment.</p> <p>\"While military personnel will be sensibly reduced, the number of troops that we will actually be able to deploy on international missions will increase,\" said defence minister Sergio Mattarella.</p> <p>Defence spending is expected to rise 50% in the next few years. Conscription, otherwise known as <i>naja</i>, can be reactivated in times of war or international crisis.</p> <p>Following similar moves in France and Germany, Italy is to abolish its draft from January 2003; eight of European Union's 17 members now done likewise. Commentators agreed the move was sound but could not help mourning what will be lost.</p> <p>The force, after all, will change almost beyond recognition. A first generation of female officer cadets have recently signed up after an eight-year campaign by the Association of Aspiring Women Soldiers (Anados). By 2002 women will be able to volunteer for every sector of the armed forces. </p> <p>Less positively, an elite alpine unit protested that the army's unifying influence would crumble due to the disproportionate number of volunteers expected from the jobless south, lured by the prospect of \u00a3635 a month. For a shop assistant on \u00a32-an-hour, that's not bad.</p> <p>Charities also expressed concern at losing the annual help of around 100,000 conscientious objectors who were allowed to serve their 10-month stint doing voluntary work; grumpy some might have been, but they were like manna from heaven.</p> <p>The Refounded Communists reiterated the argument, echoed in Germany, that conscripts ensured the army remained linked to the people, thus acting as a bulwark against militarisation and coups.</p> <p>Yet for males born after 1985, the cut-off date for the new law, such fears are for fuddy duddies. Where those born before may still have to serve their military service as the draft is phased out, they will be the first generation grateful to escape a 10-month sentence of boredom.</p> <p>After all, sons of wealthy families often studied abroad to try to avoid the call-up, which applied to those aged 18-26, and generations of fathers, uncles and elder brothers have regaled family dinner tables with tales of waste, mismanagement, homesickness and futility. </p> <p>Few were surprised last month when auditors discovered that the army had stored enough clothing and kit to last for the next 3,000 years. An inspection revealed warehouses bursting with tons of forgotten shoes, boots, underwear, hairbrushes and uniforms, including some for children or extremely small adults. Clearly a spring-clean has been long overdue.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:rory.carroll@theguardian.com\">rory.carroll@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28rory+carroll%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=rory+carroll&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Rory Carroll</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.corriere.it/\" target=\"_new\">Corriere della Sera</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ilsole24ore.com/\" target=\"_new\">Il Sole 24 ORE</a><br><a href=\"http://www.lastampa.it/Redazione/Ultima/Redazione/Menu/Principale/HomePage.stm\" target=\"_new\">La Stampa</a><br><a href=\"http://www.repubblica.it/\" target=\"_new\">La Repubblica</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ilmanifesto.it/\" target=\"_new\">Il Manifesto</a><br><a href=\"http://www.parlamento.it/\" target=\"_new\">Italian parliament</a><br><a href=\"http://governo.it/\" target=\"_new\">Italian government</a><br><a href=\"http://www.quirinale.it/\" target=\"_new\">Italian president</a></p>",
  "Boston is a city rushing towards its future. The \"Big Dig\" is hollowing out the belly of the city to allow traffic to pass beneath its growing business district. But the cold damp earth is also discharging ghosts of Boston's past, who have arisen to haunt it. <p>So far this year, the police have dug up the bodies of six victims of a particularly murderous Irish-American mob called the Winter Hill Gang. The latest body was found within the past few days and investigators believe there are many more.</p> <p>The gang is supposed to have eliminated of 18 of its enemies and disposed of the remains somewhere under the bustling city.</p> <p>Most of the bodies have been there since the 1970s, when the poor neighbourhoods of South Boston and Roxbury were ruled by the gangs and wrenched apart by racial tensions. But their significance cannot simply be consigned to the city archives.</p> <p>The gang leader charged with the killings, James \"Whitey\" Bulger is still at large, with a price on his head of $250,000 (\u00a3171,800) and the number three position on the FBI's ten most wanted list (behind Osama bin Laden and Eric Rudolph, a fundamentalist anti-abortion activist responsible for a string of bombings).</p> <p>The fact the FBI has not been able to find Whitey Bulger since he disappeared five years ago is all the more embarrassing because it turns out he was one of their own - an informant who was allowed, quite literally, to get away with murder in return for information about rival, mostly Italian, gangs.</p> <p>It is quite likely Bulger was protected for another reason. His brother William is the former president of the Massachusetts state senate and is now the president of the University of Massachusetts.</p> <p>The Winter Hill affair has seriously wounded the FBI in Boston and across the country. One of its senior agents, John Connolly, faced charges earlier this month of leaking information to Bulger and his lieutenant, Stephen \"The Rifleman\" Flemmi, which led the mobsters to two other FBI informants and a potential witness against them. All three were murdered.</p> <p>\"The Boston black eye is a very serious black eye,\" said Charles Rogovan, an expert on the FBI and organised crime from the Temple University in Philadelphia. \"This cuts to the very heart of what the bureau does.\"</p> <p>At his trial, Connolly has pleaded not guilty and refused to cooperate with investigators, and there is still no sign of the 71-year-old Bulger, rumoured to be in Ireland.

  "<p>It was the sort of story guaranteed to lift the spirits of any Daily Telegraph reader on an autumn morning. John Prescott, crossing a lake by VIP launch after opening an exhibition of Henry Moore bronzes in a Beijing park, had supposedly mouthed a string of inanities about the work of his fellow Yorkshireman. Weren't \"He didn't like heads, did he?\" and \"Hands are very hard to get right\" precisely the sort of remarks that could be expected from a man who drives two Jags? </p> <p>Within hours last Tuesday, the London Evening Standard was telling the same tale under the headline \"Look no hands\"; by Thursday the Daily Mail had put together an entire spoof page entitled Prescott's A-Z of Art. No matter that Prescott had later explained that \"a lot of the critics make the point... about hands and heads\", and that many Telegraph readers might agree. History had been written and prejudices reinforced. </p> <p>But not so fast. How did Prescott, in China to attend trade talks, end up opening a British Council exhibition of Moore's sculptures? Authentic or otherwise, the thoughts of Prescott prove to be the least interesting aspect of the affair. </p> <p>Like much else in Beijing, Beihai Park has no real British equivalent. A willow-pattern place of water and temples, pagodas and lotus flowers, it is a spiritual recreation ground for many of the city's residents. Each morning they use it for singing, dancing and t'ai-chi. On the morning of the official unveiling, the asphalt is wet with Chinese calligraphy, ephemeral graffiti done in water from the lake for the edification of passers by. And already, the bronzes are pulling crowds, as they have done every day since a team from the Henry Moore Foundation in England set them up. </p> <p>There are 12 pieces, and each has had a uniformed guard since it was found that Chinese children had a tendency to treat the works as vast, slippery climbing frames. But the guards are happy to allow touching. </p> <p>Right from the outset, the exhibition has attracted people of all ages and most classes. \"People in their 20s and 30s have been waiting for this for months,\" says Michael O'Sullivan, cultural counsellor at the British embassy in Beijing. \"They have studied Moore's work, and they know its significance.\" But O'Sullivan is more interested in what older Beijingers make of the sculptures, and he has spent many hours canvassing their opinions. \"They want to know what they are, what they represent and what they mean,\" he says. \"I tell them that in western art a work doesn't have to mean what the artist says it means. And they quite like that.\" </p> <p>The cultural counsellor has just been talking to a man who started off saying that it wasn't appropriate to have such contemporary sculptures in Beihai Park, where they would be juxtaposed with ancient monuments. \"He was worried that some of them were too pointy. It's a feng shui thing. But he ended up asking if we would be leaving one of them here. He thought we should!\" </p> <p>While the Henry Moore Foundation may be less than happy to see one of its bronzes take permanent root in Beijing soil - the show will tour to Shanghai and Guangzhou next spring anyway - the suggestion is clearly music to O'Sullivan's ears, since one of the aims of the exhibition is to raise the profile of the UK in China. </p> <p>\"Not many people here have much awareness of Britain,\" he says, \"and those who do have a very traditional image. They imagine that London resembles a scene from David Copperfield, or is full of men wearing bowler hats and carrying umbrellas.\" </p> <p>Given that China will soon be the world's biggest economy, this is an alarming state of affairs, says O'Sullivan. And while the British Council is \"not a flag-waving organisation\", it is keen to support the huge changes that are happening in Chinese society, if only because \"there would be far-reaching consequences for the rest of the world if the process of change were suddenly to fall apart\". </p> <p>Last year the council screened an entire series of The Bill, and at the same time it introduced Chinese lawyers to the concept of the jury by mounting several mock jury trials. This was all part of the process of nurturing change, while at the same time blowing away the image of pea-soupers and Beefeaters. </p> <p>Hence the exhibition of sculptures in the city. But why pick Henry Moore, an artist who died in 1986, and can hardly be considered at the cutting edge of British art? Although they are hazy about British law enforcement, Beijingers are no strangers to other western phenomena. This vast metropolis now has 80 KFCs and more than 100 McDonald's; Madonna is number one in the Chinese charts. </p> <p>But for all the savvy in matters of popular culture, the Chinese arts establishment is still isolated. Not only can local artists still find works banned for political incorrectness, the work of artists from other countries - even Asian countries - is virtually unknown in schools. </p> <p>Initially, the British Council had in mind a Hockney exhibition, but the Chinese said they were more interested in Moore. It proved to be the ideal choice. The Chinese have a long tradition of appreciating natural forms, and Beijing's parks are full of eroded rocks and boulders erected as curiosities and objects of contemplation. Yet Chinese sculpture remains firmly in the beaux arts tradition, and the sculpture parks are full of naturalistic figures exhorting the viewer to put body and soul behind the latest five-year plan. Moore, on the other hand, took natural forms and used them as a starting point for works that echoed classical forms, yet said something new. The transition from the figurative to the abstract and from nature to art is clear for all to see. </p> <p>If Moore's work seems tailor-made for a Chinese public looking to have its horizons expanded, then his life also has many points of contact with Chinese ideals. The son of a coal miner and a lifelong socialist, Moore was injured during the first world war. Yet he triumphed over adversity and became enormously prolific, even turning down a knighthood along the way. Add to this the fact that his major works are designed to be shown outdoors, where, perforce, they will be encountered by ordinary people, and the logic of Moore in China, as the exhibition is entitled, becomes startlingly obvious. </p> <p>But if the reasons for mounting the show are compelling, the practical problems involved were to prove almost insurmountable. Stand outside the Soviet-built China Art Gallery and you might think yourself in 1950s Moscow. But step inside, and you could be in a Stanley Spencer resurrection painting. For this is where 106 of Moore's smaller works are being shown, and today, as they emerge from their crates, they are greeted by pandemonium. </p> <p>\"Yesterday there were 25 people in this room watching what we were doing,\" says the white-gloved David Mitchinson, curator at the Henry Moore Foundation. \"They were asking why we were painting the columns, why we had put up false walls, why the pieces were crated in this way... They were fascinated.\" And why were they putting up false walls, exactly? Why were they coating the place with 300 gallons of whitish-grey paint, even taping over black skirting boards that spoiled the sense of space? </p> <p>It had taken two years to negotiate the use of Beihai Park, and only as the crated sculptures were being loaded on to a ship at Felixstowe Docks had the Chinese authorities sent the final written OK. On arriving in China, the crates could not be trucked into Beijing by day because of traffic restrictions, and so a procession had made its way into the city by night, while a man perched atop the highest crate kept a lookout for low bridges. </p> <p>Yet even after all this, the foundation's travelling exhibition team was insisting on remodelling the city's premier gallery. Why? Because they wanted to give Beijingers a total Western Art Experience the like of which they had never known before. </p> <p>It all seems a little excessive, until you talk to the people who work the magic - people like Malcolm Woodward, a sculptor who can position a Henry Moore bronze in the corner of a Beijing park with such exquisite sensitivity that to remove it again will seem like an act of desecration. To discuss Henry Moore with Woodward - just to hear him talk about the precise colour of a plinth - is to have your eyes opened a little wider. Which is probably why John Prescott spent most of his brief voyage on the VIP boat doing just that. \"He was really interested in the details,\" says Woodward. But who wants to read that in their morning paper?</p>",
  "The Commons met in sombre mood yesterday. MPs had just heard that Sir Edward Heath is soon to retire, having performed one last great disservice to the house he loved. He had insisted on a voting system so convoluted and unfair it produced Michael Martin as the new Speaker. <p>Sir Ted has been there for an entire half century. He spent the latter 25 years, following the choice of Margaret Thatcher as Tory leader, in a monstrous grump, or \"the incredible sulk\" as it is sometimes called. He wasn't there yesterday. MPs had to cope with their choice without his wise help, guidance and foul temper. </p> <p>\"Orrrder, orrrder\" said Mr Martin, for the first time in his new job. </p> <p>I have had some chippy email from Glasgow complaining about my animadversions on his accent. Actually Mr Martin has rather a fine brogue, as rich and textured as the deep-fried Jaffa cake supper which is (and this is true) a popular meal in his home town. The problem is not going to be that we can't understand him, but that we can't hear. Some of the time he seems to be talking to himself. At other times, his sentences tail gently away. </p> <p>\"Message from the Queen!\" said a whip. It was a rather affecting moment. In Mr Martin's neck of the woods, a message from the Queen would normally be to the effect that the old man had passed out there from an excess of whisky and 40 shilling beer. No more. \"Orrder. We have now come to questions,\" he said, almost inaudibly. </p> <p>Backbenchers rose to ask health questions, each one preceded by a sycophantic word of congratulation - even from Crispin Blunt, one of eight Tories who actually voted against him in the final division. Christopher Gill made a rambling speech and Mr Martin mumbled at him; whatever he said had the admirable effect of shutting Mr Gill up. Liam Fox asked a question and then yelled at the reply. \"Ah canna have yew shooting across a' tha minister. Y'asked a question and he's answerin' it, maybe not to yer satisfaction...\" His voice disappeared like the last bathwater down the plug hole. </p> <p>Actually, there is no such thing as a bad Speaker. MPs are not year 10 schoolboys reducing a supply teacher to a whimpering heap. They need the Commons to function, and in the end, however much they grumble, they will give Mr Martin the support he needs. If they can make out what he's saying. </p> <p>Finally, I may have solved a mystery. Is John Prescott French? As we march into the thicket of a Prescott speech, hacking at the convoluted grammar and tearing the neologisms off our trousers, our faces are brushed by sinister dangling articles. Yesterday, making a statement about the Hatfield rail crash, he spoke about \"the honourable friend, Lord Macdonald\", who \"witnessed the first hand in the aftermath of the accident\". </p> <p>He didn't want to blame \"the privatisation\" at this time, he said, but he did talk about \"the safety\". Something was supposed to be done \"by the June but they hadn't done it by the October\". </p> <p>Of course it is the French who talk like this (or the this, as Mr Prescott might say.) They have la politesse and la France where we would just say \"politeness\" or \"France\". </p> <p>I see him as Jean Presquotte, a young lad raised in the port of Marseilles. </p> <p>Bored, frustrated and certain that he can never make a life for himself at home, he stows away on a British ship bound for the Humber. Arriving in Hull he is dazzled by the white phone boxes, apparently made from solid ivory, the grandeur of Paragon station and by Ferensway, the Champs Elysees of the north. Determined to make good, he almost learns the language...</p>",
  "Nato's threats to bomb Yugoslavia accelerated the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo and 78 days of air strikes failed to achieve their main objective in a war that need never have been fought, a cross-party committee of MPs concluded yesterday. <p>In a devastating indictment of the western alliance, the Commons defence committee questions whether Nato - the world's most powerful military block - could fight a coercive war again. In future, it suggests, military intervention should be left to \"coalitions of the willing\". </p> <p>It chastises Nato governments for lack of political will, wishful thinking, bad tactics, poor intelligence and having the wrong kind of weapons. Striking a blow at the defence establishment, it states pointedly: \"The battle was not won by air power alone\". </p> <p>Despite some success in bottling up Serbian forces, air strikes on Kosovo \"unarguably failed in their declared primary objective of averting a humanitarian disaster\", say the MPs. Their contribution to achieving the alliance's objectives \"was, at best, marginal\", they say. </p> <p>Misguided hopes that Milosevic would buckle after a few days of air strikes were compounded by the illusion that wars can be fought without casualties and what the Labour-dominated committee calls a \"risk-averse mentality\". </p> <p>By making it clear well into the conflict that they would not use ground troops to force the Serb military out of Kosovo, Nato governments, including the US and Britain, might have preserved alliance unity. But they did so at a price and in military terms it was a \"serious error of judgment\", the committee says. </p> <p>In thinly disguised criticism of ministers - including Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, and Lord Robertson, then defence secretary - the committee says it was unwise for politicians to suggest a humanitarian disaster on the ground could be averted from the air. \"On the contrary,\" it says, \"all the evidence suggests that plans to initiate the air campaign hastened the onset of the disaster.\" </p> <p>Along with Russia's clear message to Milosevic that he was on his own, alliance unity was a key factor in persuading Milosevic to withdraw his forces, the MPs say in their report called Lessons from Kosovo. </p> <p>But, they add, \"the war should never have needed to have been fought. It was ... the impression of the lack of unity and resolve in the alliance at the outset which led Milosevic to think he might get away with calling Nato's bluff\". </p> <p>The war exposed serious shortcomings in Britain's capabilities, say the MPs who point out that by the end of the campaign precision-guided weapons had accounted for only 24% of the weapons dropped by the RAF. The Ministry of Defence told them that since there was less to go wrong with \"dumb\" bombs, there was less risk of civilian casualties. </p> <p>That, say the MPs, depended on the type of target attacked. Only 2% of \"dumb bombs\" were confirmed as hitting their target. </p> <p>\"The MoD's professed faith in the great utility of 'dumb' bombing in the Kosovo campaign suggests that it has been economical with the truth, if not attempting to mislead us,\" they say. </p> <p>Some of Nato's targets were \"difficult to justify\", they add, singling out the bombing of the Danube bridges at Novi Sad, one of the main centres of opposition to Milosevic. </p> <p>The MPs say Nato's doctrine needs to be revised so that it \"transparently reflects compliance with international law - to this end the questionable and mistaken decision on strategic targets needs to be opened to proper examination\". </p> <p>The MPs say there is a question about whether Nato can ever be deployed in coercive operations and whether it would not be better in future to rely on \"coalitions of the willing\" within the alliance. </p> <p>They conclude: \"The clearest lesson of Kosovo is that military might and technological superiority are not sufficient to guarantee that the alliance will prevail in addressing any future crisis.\" </p> <p>Iain Duncan-Smith, the shadow defence secretary, said yesterday that the report \"underlines yet again how the government entered into military action in Kosovo on a wing and a prayer. [It] makes it clear that the eventual plans for the Kosovo operation were not the same as the ones that set out the initial campaign.\" </p> <p>John Spellar, armed forces minister, insisting Nato's objectives were achieved, said: \"It is right that we should look at what lessons can be learnt\".</p>",
  "<p>You know those Westerns where Gary Cooper doesn't want to be the sheriff any more but everyone, including his wife, says \"Sure you do!\" In <strong> The Sins</strong> (BBC1) by William Ivory, Len Green (Pete Postlethwaite), a getaway driver, announces at his coming-out-of-prison party that he wants to shake off his old life and associates as a coyote shakes off fleas. This leads to the customary saloon fight. </p> <p>(Curiously, Pete Postlethwaite looks strikingly Red Indian, but that is by the way.) </p> <p>Mickey (Philip Jackson), landlord of the Sir Robert Peel and Len's former partner in crime, has a cunning plan to get him back behind the wheel. Mickey is in love with the Wild West. Behind him a huge mural of Monument Valley, John Ford's favourite location, glows red as hell. He gives the uncomprehending Carl a long and loving account of an old Ponderosa plot. It is a remarkable tour de force . \"There's this one episode where Lorne Greene's nephew's in town and he falls off his horse. Rattlesnake or something. Point is, the lad don't want to get back on the horse because of his experience, but Lorne Greene knows he's got to. Anyway, Lorne Greene pretends - forget her name, blonde girl, big nose, whatever - he pretends she's had an accident panning for gold up in the hills and needs help which he, Lorne, can't provide because one of his cows got stuck in a load of quicksand. Needs the immediate heave-ho from him. Solution - miladdo has to get back on his gee-gee...\" Carl lost the thread somewhere round the rattlesnake. </p> <p>Westerns are morality tales and The Sins is a fable about the seven deadly sins. The script was, obviously, much admired by actors of perception and power like Postlethwaite, Geraldine James and Frank Finlay. The speeches are much longer than is usual on TV and the language is touching and comic, like a goose trying to get airborne. Take the curiously religious word Len uses at the Job Centre: befitting. He wants a befitting job. He settles, at the end of this episode, for a life-changing career among the cadavers as an undertaker. There is always one of those in a Western too. </p> <p>Talking of crime, Don Beech is the current baddie in <strong> The Bill</strong> (ITV). He has murdered a fellow officer and wears a black polo-necked jumper to cover the scratches from their fatal fight. This would rouse the suspicions of any police station less gullible than Sun Hill. </p> <p>Last night, following a plot too serpentine to get a grip on, we found ourselves in a warehouse with: Fallon, a drugs baron; Beech, who has changed his polo neck for a black tie to attend the funeral of his victim; Hector (\"He's wanted by the FBI and the DEA for importation into the US\"); and Ray the Pimp, who is an assiduous reader of the Financial Times. If Ray the Pimp were not so engrossed in the FT, he would have noticed that Beech was nicking \u00a3500,000 from the boot of their car. Two hundred kilos of cocaine are concealed in what looks like those smart dustbins shaped liked bombs, and Hector is the only man who knows how to get cocaine out of a dustbin. </p> <p>Now, pay attention because this just zips along. Fallon the Baron orders Ray the Pimp to kill Beech. Two bent coppers, tooled up with heavy irony, (\"We decided to seek compensation for loss of career\") burst in and tie up Fallon the Baron, Ray the Pimp and Hector the Binman. Beech ungratefully fells them with the butt of his gun and blows off the electronic tracking device which Sun Hill, fleetingly in touch with common sense, have fixed to his ankle. Armed extras rush in to find Fallon the Baron, Ray the Pimp, Hector the Binman and two bent coppers lying about in heaps. </p> <p>But Beech, the Napoleon of crime, has vanished. </p> <p>Everyone adopts the traditional Sun Hill tactic of shouting a lot. \"Where's Beech?\" \"He must be here!\" The Inspector shouts loudest of all \"I want him found! TONIGHT!\" The exigencies of TV scheduling being what they are, I think Friday is a safer bet. </p> <p>Beech, in fact, has plunged into the Thames. Villains do this quite a lot on TV. Rather less in real life. Though I once watched a fugitive, little arms pumping, sprint for the Thames and jump in. The Isle of Dogs' Finest leaned on the river wall and addressed him in avuncular terms, Wouldn't he like a nice cuppa? Dog paddling doggedly, he replied in much the same terms as Eliza Doolittle offered a nice walk.</p>",
  "<p>Dennis Tito is either a very brave or a very foolish man. In any case, he is rich enough to afford to be both - and this is all that matters to the entrepreneurs who are trying to save the Russian space station, Mir, from imminent obliteration. </p> <p>Midway through an intensive cosmonaut training programme, preparing him to become the world's first space tourist, Tito declares he is not worried in the least about subjecting his 60-year-old body to the stresses involved in shooting through the atmosphere at 18,000mph. \"You get dizzier swing dancing,\" he says calmly. </p> <p>If everything goes to plan, the American multi-millionaire will be propelled into space for a 10-day stay on Mir next January as a pioneer \"citizen explorer\" - the only individual to have signed up to an apparently doomed fundraising programme, designed to keep the decaying station in orbit. </p> <p>Tito may also be the world's last space tourist, at least for some time. The Russian government indicated this week that unless more money is found, Mir will be dropped into the Pacific ocean next February in a ball of fire. </p> <p>MirCorp, a venture led by western investors which owns the rights to commercial exploitation of Russia's dying spaceship, has asked for more time to raise finance. Despite launching a series of bizarrely pointless money-spinning projects such as gameshow tie-ins and movies in space, as well as some scientific research contracts, it has so far failed to raise the huge sums needed to stave off execution. </p> <p>And rich individuals are still not queuing up to pay for a $20m (\u00a314m) ticket into orbit. After a day inspecting the astronaut training centres in Star City - the epicentre of Russia's space programme - it becomes obvious why not. Space tourism is not for the faint-hearted. </p> <p>Tito, however, is a man so obsessed with cosmic travel that he seems oblivious to the risks. This small, frail-looking Californian claims to have no concerns about the dubious safety record of his destination, shrugging off mention of the fires, computer breakdowns, collisions, fuel leaks and power blackouts which have earned it the name Starship Lada. He believes skiing is fraught with greater dangers. </p> <p>Rating his chances of not returning alive at a bearably high one in 100 (\"like a kind of Russian roulette,\" he says), he insists that the only thing he is really worried about is the likelihood that having invested all this time and money, the trip itself will prove to be a somewhat uncomfortable experience. </p> <p>Sitting in the spartan, box-like apartment allocated to him in the training compound (a far cry from his hill-top mansion in Los Angeles, so lavish that his neighbours call him \"King of the Hill\") he comments wistfully: \"After going to all this trouble, you wish that you would come back feeling that there were some pleasant moments.\" </p> <p>Instead, he says, the cramped confines of the elderly space ship (coupled with the leaking plumbing and the defective cooling system, which exudes potent anti-freeze odours) may well make him feel miserable and unwell. \"It isn't going to be a five-star hotel up there.\" </p> <p>Then there is still the possibility that the journey billed (with unusual holiday-brochure literalism) as the ultimate in out-of-this-world, get-away-from-it-all experiences, may never actually take off. </p> <p>Russian space officials are due over the next few days to make a final ruling on the fate of the 15-year-old station, which has already survived 12 years longer than intended. </p> <p>Experts have warned that the currently unmanned 130-tonne station, which is slowly sinking towards earth, must be retired before it begins an uncontrollable descent - with potentially disastrous consequences. At the moment he remains optimistic. As long as the death sentence is not brought back before February, he will depart with a valedictory mission on January 18. </p> <p>Besides, Tito is not a Richard Branson figure, embarking on a publicity venture for his company. He is a genuine cosmos fanatic, ready to seize even the slimmest chance of realising a lifelong fantasy. </p> <p>It is a preoccupation that dates back to his impressionable teenage years. The son of immigrants from Southern Italy who worked printing wine bottle labels in New York, he was enraptured as a 17-year-old by news of the Soviet Union's first satellite launch. He switched immediately to a degree in aerospace engineering and spent the first five years of his career working for Nasa. </p> <p>His passion was never shared by anyone in his family. \"If my mother were alive today she'd be sick with worry and crying all the time. My father would just think I'd gone crazy,\" he says. Neither his two sons nor his daughter - all grown up now - have inherited his enthusiasm. \"They think, 'That's just Dad for you'. They know if something happens, at least I will have been doing exactly what I wanted to do.\" </p> <p>His work with Nasa hardly touched the glamorous frontline field of space travel. \"I never thought I could become an astronaut myself. I was way down the food chain; I decided to do something constructive instead,\" he says. So he moved into investment management, where, legend has it, he began applying the mathematical formulas for space flight trajectories to investing - with some success. In the 70s he founded Wilshire Associates, a company which now looks after about $10bn in assets. </p> <p>Last week he abandoned his LA home (built, he says, in the style of an English manor house, with more rooms than he has ever bothered to count) to travel to Star City - an hour's drive from Moscow - for the final three months of preparation. </p> <p>He has brought few belongings with him; the shelves are covered only with space manuals and piles of tiny flash cards (space-ship vocabulary written in English on one side, in Russian on the other) for testing himself as he battles to learn enough Russian to talk to his two fellow crew members in time for lift-off. Next to a Russian dictionary are two jars of spaghetti sauce and some cook-in-the-bag pasta spirals. Without the chefs and servants who normally attend to him, Tito is relearning how to make his own meals. \"I don't think of myself as a rich guy any more. I'm a trainee cosmonaut and I'm living like a soldier,\" he says. </p> <p>While he has adapted swiftly to the frugality of his new life, he admits that overall conditions at the centre came as something of a surprise. No longer the showcase of a superpower, the complex is heavy with an atmosphere of decayed glory. This was the high-security centre where Yury Gagarin trained for his mission to space, the place that led the world to develop frontier-breaking technology in the 60s, an integral weapon in the USSR's cold-war struggles against America. Now it has the time-warp atmosphere of a dusty 70s-era science museum. </p> <p>A young soldier still stands by a checkpost at the entrance to the cosmonaut's town, but he doesn't have the energy to go through the rigmarole of security checks. \"You want to go in? Go on in then,\" he says, casually lifting the barrier. </p> <p>Concrete apartment blocks were built in the 50s as prestigious housing for the Soviet cosmonaut elite. Shabbier now, the flats remain - a washing line of frozen socks and underpants hanging from almost every balcony. The people who put man into space are surviving in a world without washer-driers. The only modern buildings on site are three large wooden-panelled ranch-style buildings - the Americans' cottages, imported for visiting US astronauts. Everywhere there are stained-glass windows with images of soaring pilots, mosaics showing cosmonauts floating up to space in small bubbles, statues of once proud, now dead, astronauts. These serve to depress rather than to inspire. </p> <p>It is not only the buildings but the machines that feel ancient. The mock-up space capsules - identical to the Soyuz capsule Tito will be travelling in during his journey to Mir - are filled with heavy, clunking dials and fat, yellowing, plastic switches. The equipment appears to pre-date the invention of the microchip. </p> <p>\"This is technology you would expect to see in a 50-year-old car. These are the kind of switches that you would find in an aeroplane from the 40s,\" he says, pointing at pictures in the instruction manual he is studying at night. </p> <p>His enthusiasm does not allow him to dwell on the negative for long, however. \"At least it's easy to see how it works. There is a simplicity to this 40- to 50-year-old technology; it has all been proven to work and, as long as it does the job, basic technology is fine. The cosmonauts can go up there and fix things, in the same way that you can open the bonnet and fix up your 50s car.\" </p> <p>There are some computers, but their role is not central, he says. \"A bicycle doesn't have a computer on it, but you know how it works and it will get you from A to B safely.\" Tito labours this point for some time, as if he draws personal reassurance from these arguments. </p> <p>After six weeks of preliminary training, he is already very familiar with the kind of equipment he will be using during his trip. As well as psychological testing, to ensure he was mentally up to the journey, he has undergone tough physical endurance tests to guarantee his suitability. </p> <p>The most alarming was the centrifuge. In a huge circular warehouse, a crane contraption has been designed to spin a capsule, carrying a trainee cosmonaut, around the room hundreds of times a minute. People not suited to space travel pass out during this test, designed to recreate the G-force of 3.5 which astronauts experience as they tear through the atmosphere. The effect is to make you feel three and a half times heavier than your normal weight, and it is like being \"whacked against a wall\", he says. He survived being taken up to a G-force of 8, coming out with nothing worse than the sensation of having undergone \"a Beverly Hills cosmetic lift\". </p> <p>Then there was the altitude chamber, where pressure and oxygen levels are reduced. (Tito passed the alertness test, reciting telephone numbers of ex-girlfriends to himself as it became harder to breathe.) Then the vestibular training - being spun around in a chair to determine how sick you begin to feel - and the weightlessness training in an aeroplane which is dipping and diving to create a gravity-free sensation. </p> <p>He also has one-on-one rocket science tuition, teaching him about Mir - so that, if necessary, he can perform the occasional task on board. </p> <p>Listing what he has been subjected to, Tito concludes that space tourism in its current form is unlikely to win mass appeal. \"I've made sacrifices of time, comfort and money and I still don't know if I'm going to be able to fly. Not everyone can put up with that.\" </p> <p>But he fails to see anything strange about his own desire to fly. With his old-fashioned delight in rockets and stars, Tito sees beyond the decay that surrounds him to a glorious vision of space travel. \"It has always been the nature of mankind to explore new frontiers. It's only natural to want to go beyond our planet to explore and colonise other planets,\" he says happily. \"In a few thousand years we'll have colonies on Mars.\"</p>",
  "The former Conservative prime minister Sir Edward Heath, who became Father of the House of Commons, last night ended intense speculation about his future and announced his retirement as an MP after more than 50 years at Westminster. <p>His letter to party activists in Old Bexley and Sidcup prompted a flood of tributes to the politician who took a wary Britain into Europe in 1973 - hoping in vain that he had finally settled the country's post-imperial destiny. </p> <p>Instead, the man who had drastically reformed trade union law suddenly fell from power over a miners' strike. Ousted by Margaret Thatcher in a Palace of Westminster coup in 1975, he resorted to one of the longest sulks in public life over his treatment by her. </p> <p>As the former prime minister (1970-74) last night flew out of London to visit Japan and China - where he is held in very high regard as a friend - Tony Blair spoke of his \"outstanding contribution\" and political courage. </p> <p>William Hague said he would be \"greatly missed\" while Michael Heseltine likened his European achievements to victory in the second world war. </p> <p>But Lady Thatcher, whom Sir Edward regularly denounced for 25 years, made no immediate statement. </p> <p>Though he aroused fierce loyalty among Europhile Tories like Mr Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, Sir Edward was seen as a \"traitor\" and \"virtually a socialist\" by Thatcherite Tories. </p> <p>To them Europe and economic pragmatism were his great crimes. </p> <p>The decision by Sir Edward, 84, to step down at the coming general election - which had been widely predicted but never quite believed - came the day after he presided over a seven-hour process to elect Labour's Michael Martin as new Speaker of the Commons. </p> <p>Like much else in his career, Sir Edward's handling of the election had provoked both praise and criticism, much of it from MPs on both sides, who argued that he should have used his authority to change the rules - and get the 12-candidate election over with in two quick ballots. </p> <p>Last night he stressed that the timing of his decision had nothing to do with that controversy, but was tied to Conservative HQ's deadline of November 1 for older members to state their intentions for the coming election. </p> <p>In 1997 the amateur yachtsman and musician - who conducted great orchestras - had a majority of 3,569 (6.9%) over Labour, which will now try to seize the seat. </p> <p>Sir Edward's 50 years of unbroken service as an MP fell short of David Lloyd George's 54 years and that of his hero, Sir Winston Churchill, who served 62 years in all. Like Sir Edward, Churchill, who stayed an MP until he was 89, also rejected a peerage. In the 50s, Sir Edward had been one of Churchill's rising young stars. </p> <p>Colleagues at Westminster had said that Sir Edward's constituency activists hoped he would quit, but did not want to hurt his feelings by asking. He was still busy locally and yesterday Barry Fowler, his Bexley secretary, called him a \"national and international politician who never once forgot his constituents\". </p> <p>Beset by European problems of his own, Mr Blair struck a more ambiguous note. </p> <p>\"It was Sir Edward who took this country into the European community and he can be justly proud of that. Whether you agree with his views or not, no one is ever in any doubt what they are,\" he said.</p>",
  "South Africa yesterday attempted to end the row over President Thabo Mbeki's controversial views on the causes of Aids by launching a nationwide health campaign which implicitly repudiates the presidential opinion. <p>The minister of health, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, told reporters in Soweto yesterday that the new guidelines for healthcare workers were intended to help implement the government's five-year plan released earlier this year. </p> <p>She insisted the government operated on the premise that HIV caused Aids - earlier this year Mr Mbeki attracted withering international criticism for associating with dissident theorists who doubt whether HIV is the sole cause of the disease. </p> <p>The ANC government's new campaign, launched in full-page newspaper advertisements, emphasises the benefits of safe sex and the use of condoms and faithfulness between partners. </p> <p>But criticisms remained last night that despite the new campaign, the Mbeki government was still failing to issue anti-retroviral drugs to an estimated 4.2m citizens already carrying the virus. </p> <p>The charge has been exploited by the opposition Democratic Alliance. With a eye to local government elections on December 5 - the first test of the Mbeki presidency since the general election - they have promised to distribute the medicines free of charge in municipalities which fall under their control. </p> <p>The opposition leader, Tony Leon, is expected in Europe this week for negotiations with the pharmaceutical companies on the supply of anti-retroviral drugs at reduced prices. </p> <p>The ANC hit back angrily by claiming that the opposition offer mounted to an attempt to use black people as guinea pigs in drug experiments. </p> <p>Evoking parallels with experiments with poisons carried out on blacks during apartheid, the ANC's chief spokesman, Smuts Ngonyama, said: \"We find it quite outrageous that this issue, which is at the core of survival of humanity, can be exploited for political grandstanding. </p> <p>\"[South Africans] are being used as guinea pigs and conned into using dangerous and toxic drugs that are detrimental to their own health.\" </p> <p>There are indications that support for Mr Mbeki is declining as a result of his stand. Recent polls indicate that his personal popularity has fallen from 71% in May to 52.2%. </p> <p>In spite of the ministry of health claim that the government accepts the causal link between HIV and Aids, political insiders close to the presidency report that Mr Mbeki, if anything, is becoming more emphatic in his contrary stand. </p> <p>Earlier this month a leaked account of an ANC parliamentary caucus meeting had him not only reasserting his denial of a causal link between HIV and Aids but claiming that the truth was being covered up by a conspiracy among the drugs companies, backed by the CIA. </p> <p>He claimed that the international conspiracy to undermine him and South Africa had been mounted because the country was seen as an emerging leader of the developing nations in its challenge to the world economic order. </p> <p>He also said there was a campaign to brand him as being deranged and the government was investigating those responsible.</p>",
  "Step foward GoVia, the Anglo-French company, charged with the near impossible job of trying to run the most congested rail network in Britain. Yesterday its close rival, Connex, became the first victim of one of the government's two regulators, in a political move designed to show that ministers and regulators know what it is good for commuters. <p>Sir Alastair Morton, the man responsible for building the Channel Tunnel, wielded his axe and it fell on the neck of one of Britain's worst performing rail companies. It has become a legend in its own lifetime, infamous for running short trains, packing in passengers, and allowing the public to sit in some of the dirtiest rolling stock in Britain. </p> <p>Connex and GoVia have one thing in common. The French like them. Connex, which has been operating the south central franchise from London through Surrey and Sussex for the past four years, is owned by the French multi-national, Vivendi, while the French state railway, SNCF, has a 35% stake in GoVia. </p> <p>It would ironic, not to say remarkable, if SNCF, a railway underpinned by considerable support from the French taxpayer, eventually found itself in charge of GoVia, at a time when the British government clearly believes that state control of the railways is out of date. </p> <p>What Connex and GoVia do not have in common is that GoVia controls Thames Trains, the company at the heart of the Paddington rail crash: one of its employees, driver Hodder, went through a red light. Investigations after the event brought before Lord Cullen's inquiry into the disaster, revealed that Thames has a poor record in driver training and in scutinising new employees. </p> <p>So, Sir Alastair, now chairman of the shadow Strategic Rail Authority, the government's son of British Rail, was in a cleft stick. The SSRA is supposed to be government's main representative on the platform, the trains and the booking offices. It has the power to divvy out 25 rail franchises and to withdraw them if companies under perform. Was it to be the unpopular incumbent Connex, or alternatively the company associated with Paddington? </p> <p>In the case of Connex, the public had long decided that it should go, so Sir Alastair was only responding to the public mood. If he had decided to award Connex a new 20-year franchise, he might have been strung up on Platform One at East Croydon by angry commuters. </p> <p>The SSRA can only blame itself for getting into this position. There were other bidders, but it boxed itself in by deciding that only Connex and GoVia should finally contest the franchise. </p> <p>Yesterday's announcement was presented as an example of the industry acting in the interests of the public. But it still remains an act of faith. Very little separated the companies in terms of presentation. Both promised to invest around \u00a31.5bn in the franchise over the next 20 years. It sounds a lot, but boils down to less than \u00a3170m a year, with a guaranteed commuter base. </p> <p>The announcement also puts the SSRA under the public spotlight. This is John Prescott's great white hope for the future of the railways. It is looked on as the new vibrant organisation, giving a lead to a rapidly expanding industry written off after privatisation. More than 18 months have passed since Sir Alastair was appointed chairman, and yet the industry is still crying out for a strategy. Promised for months, it has been constantly delayed: it should finally emerge before the end of the year. </p> <p>Instead of announcing a strategy, the SSRA invited train companies to come forward with their own ideas as they start their bidding in the re-franchising process. So far only two new franchises have been agreed, GoVia yesterday to replace Connex and Chiltern confirmed to operate its straightforward franchise between London and Birmingham several months ago. </p> <p>Other train companies are uncomfortable and critical. One of them said yesterday: \"We just don't know where we stand. Where is the blueprint for the industry? We should not be left in the dark.\" </p> <p>When it comes, will it reduce the industry to fewer train companies, allowing the strong to expand and the minnows to be swallowed up? Almost certainly, but the timescale for change is long and the landscape which would reduce the companies to three or four leading players will take several years to achieve. </p> <p>With clear doubts about the credentials of both Connex and GoVia, the SSRA could have adopted another option. It could have declared that neither was satisfactory and started the bidding process all over again. </p> <p>It would have delayed matters, but the Connex franchise was not due to expire until 2003, plenty of time for the SSRA to reconsider the issue. But there are political pressures on it to deliver and it has duly obliged. In an obvious reference to GoVia, it added the caveat yesterday that safety is paramount. So the SSRA will be closely monitoring the Cullen report into the Paddington crash and any implications for Thames Trains. </p> <p>Running the south central franchise, even with the re-modelled title of the New Southern Railway, will not be easy for GoVia. The name may evoke memories of kippers for breakfast on the Brighton Belle, and strike an immediate chord with passengers. It will start with some goodwill, but it will need to deliver improvements quickly. That means clean new trains and less standing. It will not be easy with such a difficult and demanding franchise. </p> <p>Keith Harper is the Guardian's transport correspondent <br><a href=\"mailto:keith.harper@theguardian.com\">keith.harper@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Kosovo is the last big Balkan problem. Despite the people's revolution in Belgrade, it may yet provide the setting for renewed conflict. While this is widely acknowledged, nobody - not the UN, not Nato, not Serbia's new rulers, not Russia, not western governments, Britain included - is agreed on what should be done to prevent it. The political disputes, tactical incompetence and military inadequacy which beset the west's Kosovo intervention last year, ruthlessly dissected in yesterday's Commons defence committee report, are damning in retrospect. But such unresolved problems also diminish confidence that the \"international community\" will perform any better in future. In concluding that \"the war should never have needed to be fought\", the report begs the question of whether the same may one day be said of a second Kosovo war: the province's avoidable but looming war of independence. <p>Solutions for Kosovo are as numerous as they are deeply flawed. Yugoslavia's new president, Vojislav Kostunica, has wasted no time in reasserting Serbia's claim. Under UN resolution 1244, Kosovo became a sort of international protectorate. Despite a likely Serb boycott, municipal elections this weekend are a step towards the sort of self-governance that the security council envisaged. But Yugoslavia never ceded, nor was it asked to cede, its territorial sovereignty. It retains the agreed right, for example, to return its troops to the scene of their ethnic crimes. Mr Kostunica's preferred solution, as with Montenegro, is to talk the province back into the fold. To this end, he has begun apologising for Milosevic era mayhem. But as an avowed Serb nationalist and critic of Nato's intervention, he is unlikely to give up on Kosovo. </p> <p>Unfortunately for Mr Kostunica, the vast majority of Kosovans has long since given up on Serbia. Their solution, Belgrade's democratic dawn notwithstanding, is outright independence. On this all parties, except the few remaining Serbs and Roma, agree. They began to fight for this cause under Milosevic; and they are clearly prepared to fight for it again, against Serbia for sure, but also, prospectively, against anybody who denies them their rights. This may come to include the very UN and Nato forces who were sent to their rescue and who have since tried to disband the Kosovo Liberation Army. Despite the UN administrator Bernard Kouchner's best efforts, the creation of a law-based, multi-ethnic civil society in Kosovo remains a fond dream. Even as an OSCE report bemoaned continuing intimidation of minorities, a rocket-propelled grenade was slamming into Serb flats in Pristina on Monday evening. Given this strength of feeling, a UN commission has recommended \"conditional independence\" as the best solution for Kosovo. But its complicated formula falls short of Kosovan aspirations, and in any case, would be opposed by Mr Kostunica, by Russia (which he visits this week) and by jumpy neighbours. </p> <p>Yet even flawed solutions are preferable to no solution at all - the west's present position. In all logic, having taken Kosovo from its owners by force, it could be expected to support its full independence. But this course, floated at the Rambouillet talks, sank with all hands and is now seen, post-Milosevic, as politically impossible. It would also be very expensive. Much emphasis is now placed on reconciliation, on time the healer, on keeping options open. Savvy diplomats describe this policy as \"constructive ambiguity\". This is a polite term for drift. Something may turn up, as Mr Micawber said. But if not, get ready for yet another war that need never have been fought.</p>",
  "<p>British Airways' German subsidiary has been ordered to withdraw claims that its rival Lufthansa was acting anti-competitively. </p> <p>Deutsche BA, Germany's second largest domestic carrier, has been ordered by a Dusseldorf court not to repeat controversial claims made about the country's biggest airline. </p> <p>Two weeks ago, under the heading \"Deutsche BA fears for German domestic market competition\", the carrier had set out a list of question and answers designed to highlight its concerns about Lufthansa's intention to buy a stake in Eurowings, the third biggest player in the market. </p> <p>The Deutsche BA publicity claimed: \"Lufthansa shows its true face - the airline is not interested in the welfare of its passengers, rather in the preservation of its power ... There must not be a return to the past when Lufthansa squeezed the German market like a lemon.\" </p> <p>Yesterday, Lufthansa said that the issuing of a court injunction confirmed its opinion that Deutsche BA's \"untrue and disparaging remarks [had]... overstepped the legal limits for advertising and competition rules\". </p> <p>Lufthansa said that it had particularly objected to claims that passengers would no longer have a choice and would have to accept its monopolistic prices if Eurowings were to sell. </p> <p>Deutsche BA initially agreed to withdraw three claims made in its press statement, but Lufthansa successfully applied to a judge for an order banning publication of a further two. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Deutsche BA appeared unrepentant.

We could have fought against it in court, but we feel it would have detracted from the real issue, which is free competition.\" </p> <p>She also stood by the claim that under the proposed Eurowings deal Deutsche BA would be left as the only competitor to Lufthansa, which would control 84% of domestic flights. </p> <p>There was also concern that Lufthansa controlled the lion's share of slots at many German airports including 67% at Frankfurt, she said.</p>",
  "At least one person was killed when supporters of the Ivory Coast's civilian opposition leader, Laurent Gbagbo, took to the streets of the capital, Abidjan, yesterday after the commander of the country's ruling junta, General Robert Guei, declared himself the winner in Sunday's presidential election. <p>A crowd of at least 2,000 repeatedly regrouped near the presidential offices after being dispersed by soldiers and military police using machine guns and firing tear gas. </p> <p>The body of one demonstrator lay in the street after a burst of gunfire.

On Monday the National Electoral Commission reported that Mr Gbagbo, of the Ivorian Popular Front (IPF), had taken a commanding lead in the contest. </p> <p>Mr Gbagbo implored the country's residents to take to the streets last night after Gen Guei's victory was announced. </p> <p>Daniel Bamba Sheik, director-general of the interior ministry's territorial administration department, said Gen Guei took almost 53% of the vote, against 41% for Mr Gbagbo. </p> <p>He blamed the decision to disband the commission on massive fraud and the inability of its officials. </p> <p>\"This commission, visibly lacking in experience, instituted operational procedures for tabulating results that made the results unacceptable, causing, as was observed, mistakes and confusion,\" he said. </p> <p>He went on to accuse several parties, including the IPF, of bussing voters from Abidjan to villages in the interior to vote twice. </p> <p>Members of the electoral commission were accompanied by armed guards yesterday and were not allowed to speak to journalists. </p> <p>The country's two largest political parties boycotted the ballot after their leaders were barred from running by the supreme court, leaving only Mr Gbagbo to run against the junta leader.

  "Russian anti-nuclear campaigners yesterday demanded a popular vote on whether the country should be turned into what they dub \"the world's nuclear waste dump\".

  "Once they used to swim to and from their traditional summer grazing grounds on the islands off the coast on northern Norway. Now they take the ferry. <p>Thousands of starving reindeer, too weak to make the crossing, are being carried across in landing craft. The Norwegians say the indigenous Sami (formerly known as Lapps) are themselves to blame because they have built up their herds to levels which lead to overgrazing: more than 125,000 reindeer in an area with food for fewer than 100,000. </p> <p>It is a land of stunted birch trees, long fjords, and small grassy islands, and the question of who controls it has become a major political issue. The Sami claim traditional rights. The Norwegian government, which annexed it in an attempt to extinguish the Sami's cultural identity, says it is the owner. </p> <p>The battle is a long-running one, but plans to open untouched parts of Finnmark to gold mining threaten to push the Samis beyond the point of endurance. Ragnhild Nystad, their vice-president, said: \"If we cannot stop multinational mining companies taking over our land then the Sami's traditional way of life will disappear. As a people, reindeer herding is central to our culture.\" </p> <p>The Sami live in a wide belt across northern Scandinavia, much more extensive than the geographical area known as Lappland. For thousands of years their people knew no national boundaries.They were left unmolested in inhospitable country. </p> <p>Their troubles began when four countries drew lines across their traditional lands and attempted to suppress their culture, language and lifestyle. Despite this, they survived. There are 4,000 still clinging to their way of life in Russia, 10,000 in Finland, 20,000 in Sweden and 50,000 in Norway. Their language has nine dialects. </p> <p>By 1900 they had officially ceased to exist in all four countries. It was illegal to speak the language or sing their traditional songs. A century later they have revived as a nation and formed a joint council embracing the four states, and now they have their own parliament building. </p> <p>On November 3, in acknowledgment of their new status, King Harold of Norway will open the parliament, in Karasjok, the Sami capital of Finnmark: a small town in the most thinly populated part of Europe. </p> <p>Although this new status is an immense leap forward, the Sami believe it is incomplete without a resolution of the land issue, and the Norwegian government, albeit reluctantly, accepts this. </p> <p>The Sami say they hold the land in common, individual families having traditional grazing and fishing rights. The herds are owned, the family mark being a cut in the reindeer's ear. </p> <p>Under government ownership, the grazing land was gradually whittled away by privately owned farms. But after a human rights commission study three years ago, the Norwegian constitution was amended on April 21 1998 to recognise the Samis as an indigenous people and an ethnic minority. </p> <p>The reawakening of Sami pride in their race and culture began after the second world war, and became a militant force with a now celebrated protest against a hydroelectric scheme on the Alta river in Finnmark. The scheme, which threatened traditional lands and the community at Masi, led to sit-down protests, hunger strikes, and links with environmental groups. The protests failed to stop the dam, but created a new spirit of defiance and a new nation. </p> <p>Twenty years of campaigning later Norway, Sweden and Finland recognise the Sami as an ethnic minority but the issue of land rights is still unresolved. </p> <p>Ms Nystad said: \"We own this land, we always have. It was taken away from us illegally and we want it back. We cannot stand by and watch it whittled away as more and more is sold off for farms and holiday cabins. There will be nothing left for the reindeer.\" </p> <p>In Oslo the minister responsible for Sami issues, Steiner Pedersen, admitted that the land issue was central to the Sami's future. At present the Sami had no power to stop gold mining, \"but it is a sensitive topic and they have a lot of influence\". The government was working on a plan to give the Sami parliament joint control of over planning issues with Finnmark county. </p> <p>Ms Nystad believes the government is playing for time. \"As a nation we have lived here for thousands of years in tune with our environment. It is not us that that have caused problems. We are still waiting for promises given to us in 1981 over the Alta dam to be honoured. We have been disappointed many times since then and we are not going to let it happen again with the gold mine. The Samis have been patient for too long.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Deep South. On the run from a chain gang, Everett (George Clooney), Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) have managed to hitch a ride with a passing motorist - serial bank robber George \"Babyface\" Nelson (Michael Badalucco). Sirens wail in the distance, as George greets his passengers. </p> <p>\"George Nelson. It's a pleasure.\" </p> <p>Without warning, he opens the driver door and strides on to the car's running board, casually turning to Everett. </p> <p>\"Grab the tiller, will ya buddy?\" </p> <p>Somewhat aghast, Everett slides over and takes the wheel. With one arm holding on to the roof, George glances back at the police cars gathering speed behind, then gestures towards Delmar. </p> <p>\"Hand up that Thompson, Jack.\" </p> <p>Delmar fumbles for a machine gun. </p> <p>\"Say, what line of work you in, George?\" </p> <p>Cut to George standing on the running board, laughing maniacally as he sends a hail of bullets towards the police. </p> <p>\"COME AND GET ME COPPERS! YOU FLAT-FOOTED, LAME-BRAINED, SOFT-ASSED SONS OF BITCHES! NO ONE CAN CATCH ME! I'M GEORGE NELSON! I'M BIGGER THAN ANY JOHN LAW THAT EVER LIVED!\" </p> <p>Still firing on his pursuers, he notices a herd of cows in an adjacent field. </p> <p>\"Cows... I hate cows worse than coppers.\" </p> <p>He begins shooting at the herd. One cow falls to the ground as the rest stampede. Delmar looks out of the window, appalled. </p> <p>\"Aw, George... not the livestock.\" </p> <p><strong> See also:</strong> The Killing of Sister George, Babe, Heathers </p> <p><strong> Don't see also:</strong> Twister </p> <p><strong> Pointless trivia:</strong> Besides playing the homicidal maniac George Nelson here, Michael Badalucco also played the serial killer David Berkowitz in Spike Lee's Summer of Sam.</p>",
  "Moves to avert a diplomatic row between Britain and Cuba were under way yesterday after the Havana authorities took steps to allow diplomats access to six British security firm workers detained on suspicion of industrial espionage. <p> The British consul in Havana, Bernard Garside, met Cuban officials last night in an attempt to gain access to the five men and one woman who were being held at an undisclosed location on the Caribbean island.</p> <p> The move by Cuba followed a statement from the Foreign Office demanding \"immediate access\" to the Britons, who have been held for more than two weeks. Conflicting accounts of what the six were doing in the country emerged last night.</p> <p> It was rumoured they had been arrested on suspicion of some form of industrial espionage involving the oil or gas industry. But there were also reports that the five men were private eyes hired to tail a millionaire businessman suspected of cheating on his wife.</p> <p> Ken Lodge, from east London, John Fawcett, also from London, and Derek Pitt, from Hertfordshire, were thought to be among those detained.</p> <p> Mr Garside received assurances that the six detainees were in good health and that he would be granted access within the next 48 hours, the Foreign Office said last night.</p> <p> \"The Cuban authorities are investigating allegations that the six had been hired in connection with a private investigation into a case of marital infidelity involving a Cuban national for which they were using methods in breach of Cuban law.\"</p> <p> No charges had yet been brought and the Cuban authorities had undertaken to provide access to a lawyer, he added. </p> <p> \"We will continue to press the Cuban authorities to honour their obligations under international conventions and grant access to consular staff without delay.\"</p> <p> Mr Garside was told on October 9 that the six had been arrested. But the Cuban government did not give official notification of their detention until October 13, and despite requests for consular access to be granted the interior ministry refused permission for British officials to visit them.</p> <p> Peter Hain, the Foreign Office minister, said yesterday: \"It is unacceptable that six British nationals are being held in Cuba without explanation and without access. </p> <p> \"Their relatives have the right to know what is happening to them, they themselves have the right to know why they are being held, and the British government has the right to offer them consular protection.\"</p> <p> Stephen Jakobi, of Fair Trials Abroad, said the fact the six had been refused access to consular help could mean the Cuban authorities considered that they were a threat to national security. </p> <p> \"It is unprecedented for the British government not to be given access for this length of time,\" he said. \"That persuades me it is no ordinary criminal matter.\" Mr Jakobi said whatever the outcome there was no way the six could get a fair trial. \"In 16 days you can get anybody to declare they are the Queen of Sheba. It's stunningly bad and in breach of that very basic diplomatic treaty, the Vienna convention.\"</p> <p> The detained Britons will have sampled conditions in Cuban jails which were condemned in a recent report by the Washington-based Human Rights Watch as \"substandard and unhealthy where prisoners face physical and sexual abuse\".</p> <p> The report added: \"Most prisoners suffer malnourishment from an insufficient prison diet and languish in overcrowded cells without appropriate medical attention.\"</p> <p> The effect on prisoners was dramatically underscored with the release last month of the 24-year-old British woman Rachel McGee, who spent 22 months in a Cuban jail for drug trafficking. During her sentence she lost three stones, suffered worms, a kidney infection, stomach problems and bleeding gums.</p>"
