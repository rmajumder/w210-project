  "<p>Lightning rarely strikes twice in the same place. Eighteen months ago the National Theatre launched an ensemble of black and white actors with a Shakespearean study of doomed love. But where Troilus and Cressida was a triumph, this Romeo and Juliet, which introduces another new company, is a muddled, mediocre affair characterised by poor verse-speaking. </p> <p>The first thing this play requires is a sense of place; the two best productions I've seen (Zeffirelli's and Michael Attenborough's) were set respectively in Renaissance Verona and contemporary Sicily. But Tim Supple's modern-dress version seems, literally, all over the place. We have black Montagues and white Capulets, which is fair enough. But then we also have dark-suited mafiosi, machine-gun-toting soldiers, Latin American music and an Irish whisky-priest in Friar Laurence. I assumed we were in a composite Graham Greeneland but, although you find the odd echo of Haiti or Cuba, nothing fits politically. Robert Innes Hopkins' designs - two curved, mobile walls - do nothing to anchor the play. </p> <p>If I add that the verse-speaking is often dismal, people will assume I am making a racist point; and, in a sense, I am. Why is it that the white actors speak the verse so poorly? Charlotte Randle is a good actor who has impressed in the past; but as Juliet she not only mistakes running exits and entrances for youthful impetuosity but chops the verse up into tiny, over-emphasised fragments. At one point she tells a surprised Friar Laurence, \"O bid me LEAP rather than marry Paris.\" Was she announcing she was for the high jump? What Juliet means, of course, is that she'd rather leap from the battlements of any tower. And she is not the sole offender: even an experienced actor like Ronald Pickup as Capulet mumbles semi- coherently into his beard. </p> <p>What this play needs above all is heat, passion and a death-marked eroticism; but, although the text is drenched in sun imagery, in Supple's production no one sweats. The one actor with the requisite fire is Chiwetel Ejiofor, whose fine Romeo progresses from moping courtly lover to someone spurred by untrammelled sexual desire. He is almost alone in speaking the verse with intelligent feeling but he operates in a vacuum since his Juliet is a foot-stamping Violet Elizabeth Bott and Patrick O'Kane's Mercutio is a Celtic babbler. </p> <p>Pace is achieved at the expense of clarity. But the giveaway sign is the way Adrian Lee's ubiquitous music is used to signal emotion in much the same way as a Morricone score in a spaghetti Western. </p> <p>The production is not a disaster, just a disappointment. But the question it urgently raises is when will Trevor Nunn, whose own productions largely sustain the National, surround himself with a directorial team capable of working to his level. </p> <p>\u0095 In rep.

  "<p>The Bank of England's widely expected decision to keep interest rates at 6 per cent for the eighth month running will be welcomed by homeowners. The move means mortgage lenders are unlikely to raise their rates and homeowners - many of whom are already mortgaged to the limit as a result of the past year's house price boom - can breath easy. </p> <p>It's also good news for anyone with an overdraft or anyone planning to take out a personal loan. The decision means the Bank will continue to lend to commercial banks at 6 per cent, making it difficult to justify any increase in the cost of their loans and overdrafts.</p> <p>In contrast, savers will be less enthusiastic as banks and building societies are unlikely to offer them a better rate.</p> <p>Evidence has been coming in that some of the country's more popular stocks are seeing a rise in share price in the wake of the decision.</p> <p>Exporters who are competing against European rivals will also welcome the move. The pound's strength against the euro makes British products more expensive.</p> <p>The Bank gave no reason for its decision, but it probably reflects the widely held view that inflation is under control. The current inflation rate is 1.9 per cent, significantly below the government's target of 2.5 per cent. The impact of the fuel crisis and a slowdown in the housing market are also thought to have influenced the monetary policy committee - the group of nine economists who decide the rate.</p> <p>Rates were increased four times between September 1999 and February as an attempt to slow economic growth and keep inflation under control.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the European Central Bank shocked the city by announcing an interest rate rise from 4.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent.</p>",
  "<p>Although Shivaree is nominally a band, all interest is inevitably going to focus on vocalist Ambrosia Parsley (her real name, should you feel inclined to believe her record company). She lounges at the microphone like a supermodel on Mandrax, thumbs hooked into trousers sliding down her hips to reveal a perfectly-formed navel. She fixes the audience with a quizzical gaze from beneath semi-lowered eyelids, while her lyrics float languidly over whatever the band can think of to throw at her - mambos, bossa novas, elevator schmaltz or primitive skating-rink pop. It's like the 1950s, the 1960s and the 23rd century all rolled into one. </p> <p>It might all seem like little more than an ingenious gimmick were it not for the fact that the band can muster a display of hard-boiled expertise in any number of styles, while Ambrosia's erotic, exotic ghost of a voice is far tougher and more subtle than it appears. In Goodnight Moon, Shivaree's new single, Ambrosia's voice is like a gun hidden under a mink coat. </p> <p>It's part of Shivaree's surreal appeal that the musicians resemble long-serving veterans from any number of forgotten campaigns. On keyboards and synths, Danny McGough bears a passing resemblance to actor Lloyd Bridges as he gyrates around his battery of devices. Beefy blond guitarist Duke McVinnie (another name straight out of Dashiell Hammett) looks like the Beach Boy that time forgot as he hunches over his Fender. And when Ambrosia sings the blues, it's like subsiding into a Radox bath with a bottle of whisky.</p>",
  "<p>The Pan Pan company and its director Gavin Quinn have always made an absurdist, dysfunctional kind of theatre, but you wonder at the Ozzie critics who sent this show home from the Adelaide festival this year with an award. </p> <p>The audience are welcomed into a bright white space by three actors who beam idiotically at us for a while. Bored with each other, they focus their confessional, often lewd, attentions on us, even climbing among the seats to hug people. </p> <p>Then the lights go down, and the kids knuckle down to daft, disjointed, knockabout routines. The actors, Kevin Hely, Emma McIvor and James Hosty, speak as \"themselves\". </p> <p>There are things you may never have seen before in a theatre, such as a man pulling out his penis and pissing into a bucket, stopping, starting again, stopping and starting. Hosty, a dancer-actor, displays wonderful muscle control here - I'm sure I would have dried, as they say. </p> <p>Grotesquely pulled faces, ridiculous songs and eye-poke routines degenerate into wrestling that is more bum-sniffingly sexual than aggressive. McIvor blow-jobs a microphone, and Hely complains how his obsessive hygiene has left him with a hand smelling of \"cunt and Domestos\". </p> <p>It's like some silly party game, and the only adrenalising factor is Brian Mooney's music and howling feedback loops. Mooney also provides the goofed-out guitar behind the final jilted love song - perhaps the key to Quinn's opus. </p> <p>The piece seems hypnotised by theory and the psychodrama of the rehearsal studio. At 80 minutes it is way overlength, and by the time it shrieks to a halt, it has disappeared up its own behind. </p> <p>\u0095 Until October 10. Box office: 00 353 1 677 0643 .</p>",
  "<p>Six years ago, Martin Williams was a rat-catcher with Doncaster council. He lived in an average semi-detached house in the small town of Thorne on the outskirts of Doncaster and, to his neighbours and his workmates, was a pretty normal bloke living a pretty unremarkable life. </p> <p>Then he was sacked for taking time off work without permission, something he vehemently denied. His world collapsed around him. He had spent 10 very content years driving his van round the leafy South Yorkshire lanes of Thorne, catching rats and destroying wasps' nests, passing the time of day with the locals and loving every minute of it. Suddenly, it was all taken from him. Over the next few years, Doncaster council was to rue the day it sent Williams packing. </p> <p>Last month, a high court judge was asked to stop Doncaster council going ahead with the closure of two residential homes for elderly people. While it is not uncommon these days for local authorities to face such legal action, what was unusual about this legal move was that it was instigated - and paid for - by a councillor from the local authority itself. That councillor was Williams. </p> <p>In the six years since he lost his job, the one-time local rat man has become a thorn in the side of Doncaster council. When he heard that residents' relatives were opposed to the homes' closure, he immediately instructed his barristers to ask the high court for permission for the case to go to judicial review. In the end, the application was refused. It cost Williams a few thousand pounds, but he was quite prepared to spend the \u00a340,000 he estimates it would have cost if the case had gone ahead and he had lost. </p> <p>He can easily afford it. When he appeared before an industrial tribunal in 1995 in an unsuccessful bid to claim unfair dismissal, it was revealed that this humble rat man was a rich rat man indeed. He was part-heir to a family fortune worth more than \u00a311m and had been brought up in historic Brodsworth Hall, now a jewel in the crown of English Heritage. He was dubbed the millionaire rat catcher. </p> <p>It ought to have been obvious to his bosses and his workmates that something was different about Williams. He refused to wear the standard boiler suit the council had provided for him. Instead, he had a pair of overalls made-to-measure with his name sewn in gold thread on the breast pocket. On his head, he wore a top-quality deerstalker. </p> <p>Unluckily for certain Doncaster councillors, at the same time that the authority sacked Williams they also gave notice to an environmental health officer, Peter Gumsley, and the two men became friends with a common bond - to get their own back. Gumsley claimed he had been dismissed on trumped-up allegations of time off without permission because he had refused to go along with what he felt were corrupt practices in his department. </p> <p>Williams seized on this and soon the district auditor had a pile of papers on his desk, containing serious allegations against councillors and officers by the former environmental health officer. Williams and Gumsley firmly believe that this was the birth of \"Donnygate\", the ongoing scandal of corruption at Doncaster council that has seen 13 councillors found guilty of fraud - five of whom have been jailed - with, perhaps, more to come. </p> <p>Still seething, Williams then set up his own pest control business and began to take customers off the local authority. Two years ago, not satisfied that the council was by then under the national spotlight and becoming a byword for corruption, he decided he would help fill the void left in the council chamber as a succession of Labour councillors resigned in disgrace. Standing for election in Thorne, he won. Last year, his wife, Carol, joined him. And the two of them have been causing havoc since. </p> <p>As well as the residential homes issue, a row is raging over the council's attempts to close sixth forms in some schools - one of which is in Thorne. Residents are mobilising for a long fight and, predictably, the Williamses are in the forefront of the battle. </p> <p>Locals cannot remember when there has been so much dissatisfaction with their local authority and are demanding change. Some have turned their anger on Thorne-Moorends town council, which they claim simply pays lip service to big brother Doncaster. They are demanding what is known as a \"parish poll\" - a referendum on whether the town council should be abolished. Williams has declared his readiness to dip into his pocket again if legal action is required to force such a vote. </p> <p>It need never have been like this. \"I was very happy to be a rat man,\" says Williams, 49. \"I did it for 10 years and loved it. Then I got sacked for something I didn't do and my world collapsed. I have a debt of gratitude to pay to the people of my area who have given me back my self-respect. To the electorate in Thorne, I will always be eternally grateful.\"</p>",
  "<p>The pages had yellowed and the dense, controlled writing bore precious little resemblance to the scrappy, barely legible scrawl that careers across my notebooks these days. Slowly, I read aloud the brief sentence at the top of one page: \"To within isomorphisms, there are two groups of order: the cyclic group C4 and Klein's 4-group.\" Nothing. No bell rang, however distant. The strings of words and characters might have been lifted straight from the Dead Sea scrolls for all they meant to me. </p> <p>I knew without having to check the cover that the dog-eared exercise book that emerged from the bottom of a packing crate during a recent house move was filled with my A-level maths notes. I remember how I had decided at the time that compressing my handwriting to the verge of requiring a magnifying glass would somehow help to impose clarity on my disordered mind, make it more mathematical. But nothing else seemed familiar. I flicked through pages devoted to Lagrange's Theorem and inverse hyperbolic functions and Argand diagrams but nothing came. Years of high-quality education seemed to have passed through my cortex as smoothly as a pint of lager slips through the digestive tract on a hot summer's day. </p> <p>I was reminded of this mildly depressing episode when a new study yesterday called for an end to compulsory maths education in secondary schools. Steve Bramall, a London University lecturer in the philosphy of education, argued that the subject is \"a restricted and limited means of describing and communicating about the world\". He suggested that studying sociolology - \"a subject expressly committed to developing in pupils an awareness and appreciation of the contexts of moral and political action\" - might be more useful. \"Higher mathematical knowledge and competence is not needed by the majority of the populace to ensure the economic success of modern industrialised society,\" chimed his co-author, Paul Ernest, himself a professor of mathematical education, no less. </p> <p>My first reaction, like that of anyone else who has spent precious teenage hours poring over the Newton Raphson Iteration, was mild outrage. What about all those studies showing Britain to be embarrassingly innumerate? What about the demands of a world increasingly dominated by science? What about Carol Vorderman? </p> <p>The trouble, of course, is that without being able to summon a single meaningful scrap from two years of maths education (strangely the O-level syllabus seems to have stuck) it is quite hard to marshal a defence for Gauss's Queen of Sciences. I wracked my brains for examples of how my maths had come in useful in later life. There had been a vague glimmer of recognition when Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein published their ugly pseudo-scientific tract, The Bell Curve - I had once spent hours producing similar graphs, though usually plotting the thickness of washers produced by a screw factory rather than the IQs of ethnic groups. Then there was the night a heated argument with my wife about a principle of sailing (we were both beginners) ended with me furiously scribbling vector diagrams on a paper napkin to prove my point. I will save her writing in by admitting now that I ended my demonstration with the declaration: \"I've got two maths A-levels and a physics S-level so I can't believe you're still arguing with me about this.\" On our next sortie I insisted on proving my point and was promptly catapulted into the water. </p> <p>On the face of it this seems a pretty poor return on years of hard work. I still know enough maths to calculate that I must have spent more than 1,000 hours studying the subject at A-level alone, at least half as much again if you include my whole time at secondary school. It's hard not to wonder whether that time might have been more usefully employed reading Shakespeare, or learning Farsi or just doing unpleasant teenage things that I might conceivably have been able to remember 20 years later. </p> <p>But the truth is that my memories of grappling with the Wilcoxin test and Kendall's co-efficient - though I could not now tell you a single thing about them - are by far the fondest of my school career. I can still feel the thrilling sensation of stumbling into some secret and distant country as our gnomic teacher Dr Solomon (I don't think he had a first name) introduced us to numbers that did not exist or multi-dimensional space. The inaccessibility of much of the subject matter only added to its appeal; I could always read a novel or learn a language in later life, I reasoned, but friends studying English and French would never know the delights of an inverse hyperbolic function. </p> <p>Until sex came along there wasn't much to rival the satisfaction to be got from producing a crisp proof. I couldn't have made head or tale of a line of it but when Princeton mathematician Andrew Wiles later told me about the \"feeling of naturalness and elegance\" of his historic proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, I understood exactly what he was talking about. Wiles compared the process of edging towards a proof to making your way through a large house in darkness. \"You work your way around the room and you begin to feel objects here and there and suddenly the light goes on and you can see everything clearly.\" For a moment I wished I had pressed a little further into his house of numbers. </p> <p>As it was, I never got past Dr Solomon's introductory tour and it wasn't long before I found myself wondering whether all those hours of labouring over equations were well spent. At 3am on the day I was supposed to deliver my first university essay I found myself staring at a blank sheet of paper in a state of blind panic: I didn't have the faintest idea how to write an essay; in two years of studying maths and physics I hadn't been required to produce one. </p> <p>The stock defence of maths, like Latin, is that it teaches structured and disciplined ways of thinking, but I'm not convinced. At least at school level, maths is all about hard, clean answers, the certainty that a solution is out there to be found. By and large, though, the world isn't like that; it is about arguments and choices and complex, messy decisions. Even the most exciting areas of science in the past 20 years have been in the relatively \"messy\" fields of biology and quantum physics. These areas may rely as heavily on high-level maths as any other but a high school grasp on the subject won't help much to get your head around them - philosophy might be more useful. </p> <p>Meanwhile, I'm glad to report that my efforts to recall a single useful fact from my mathematical education did throw up one tantalising nugget: if you take a deep breath while reading this there is a better than 99 per cent chance that you will inhale a molecule of air which was exhaled by Julius Caesar in his dying breath. Don't ask me to prove it - I wouldn't know where to start - but I'm sure you'll agree it shows all those years weren't completely wasted.</p>",
  "The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, were meeting face to face today, according to unconfirmed reports. <p>Earlier, as fresh violence erupted in the West Bank and Gaza, Mr Barak had warned that peace negotiations would not resume until the fighting stops.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had urged Mr Barak and Mr Arafat, to return to \"the psychology of peacemaking\". </p> <p>Ms Albright was reported to have begun brokering direct talks between the Middle East leaders late this afternoon.</p> <p>Earlier, Mr Arafat said that he would see Mr Barak only if there was a guarantee that his people would be protected and an inquiry was launched into the fighting.</p> <p>Ms Albright held separate meetings earlier today with the two leaders in Paris. She hoped to convene the three-way meeting earlier today but both leaders initially rejected the move. </p> <p>Sixty people, mostly Palestinians, have died during six days of fighting between Israeli soldiers and police. But Mr Barak said he held the Palestinians responsible for the violence. </p> <p>In her two-hour session with Mr Barak, at the residence of the US ambassador, Felix Rohatyn, the Israeli prime minister told Ms Albright that the Palestinians were violating agreements with Israel. The Palestinians were acquiring illegal arms and shooting at soldiers, Mr Barak's office said. </p> <p>Afterwards, Ms Albright met with Mr Arafat for 90 minutes. </p> <p>A senior Palestinian official has said an international inquiry into Israel's actions would be a condition of reviving the peace talks. But Mr Barak's office has said he \"totally rejected the call for an international investigation.\" </p> <p>Fighting broke out last week after an Israeli hardliner, the Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, visited one of Jerusalem's most hotly-contested holy sites, a spot revered by both Jews and Muslims. The dispute over who will control the site is the main obstacle to a peace agreement. </p> <p>Mr Chirac has blamed the violence on an \"irresponsible provocation\". Many have interpreted this is a clear reference to Sharon's visit to the holy site. </p> <p>Mr Sharon, notorious among Palestinians for launching the bloody war against Mr Arafat's forces in Lebanon in 1982, denied responsibility and blamed Mr Arafat. </p> <p>The Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, is planning a leadership summit tomorrow. Mr Barak and Mr Arafat have both agreed to come, Mr Mubarak claimed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, said that Iraq has the potential to quickly restrain Israel if its Arab neighbours give it territory from which to mount operations against the Jewish state, despite the sanctions imposed on his country.</p>",
  "There is little apparent urgency about the trilateral talks in Paris which are aimed at ending the carnage in the Holy Land. US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has held separate meetings with Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian president Yasser Arafat. All three are supposed to move on to substantive discussions of the situation, and of the wider peace process. But Barak says he will not meet the Palestinian leader until the violence stops, and Arafat for his part is saying his people must be \"protected\" before he will sit at the same table as Barak. <p>These are dangerous times and dangerous tactics. Barak, an ex-army chief, is parroting the conventional Israeli military wisdom that Palestinian leaders can turn the violence off and on like a tap. That is, and always has been, manifest nonsense, especially at a time of white-hot anger on the streets. </p> <p>Arafat too is playing with fire if he imagines he can extract concessions from the Israelis when they are under fire. He may not control the riots, but his best chance of making Barak budge is to get the Americans on his side. And to do that he needs to be willing to talk, all night if necessary, instead of dithering in the ante room. </p> <p>As the death toll mounts - it is now over 60 and climbing - the greatest danger is that neither Barak nor Arafat can regain control of their own streets. The anger of the Palestinians is manifest, but there is growing unease in Israel too about the threat to isolated Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank. </p> <p>There is also widespread alarm about the unprecedented surge of violence involving Israel's 1m Arab citizens, most of whom identify with the Palestinian cause, if not with Arafat's embryonic statelet. For the Americans, the ultimate nightmare is that the unrest will spill out of Israel and the territories and infect the wider Middle East region. </p> <p>Already Jordan - diplomatically closely allied to the USA and Israel - is seething with anger about the conflict on its doorstep, and has opened its borders to wounded Palestinians needing treatment. In Syria too anger has erupted on the streets, with a mob attack on the US embassy in Damascus. Police dispersed the rioters, mostly students, but not before they had pelted the embassy with rocks and rubbish. </p> <p>There is as yet, though, little sign of a concerted Arab diplomatic initiative. Nor, for that matter, is the EU doing much more than issuing earnest appeals for calm. As usual, it is the Americans who are in the driving seat, and there is every chance that the hard decisions that are needed will be made not in Paris, Israel or Palestine, but in Washington. </p> <p><b>Useful links:</b> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/10/04/mideast.violence.02/index.html \" target=\"_new\">CNN coverage of the Paris summit</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.idf.il/english/news/main.htm\" target=\"_new\">Israel Defence Forces</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.israel.org/gov\" target=\"_new\">Government of Israel</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jrep.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Report</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pna.net\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/news/newstext.asp?4205\" target=\"_new\">Robin Cook's call for calm</a></p>",
  "<p>If the cost cutting and job losses had not already made it plain to employees of the BBC that its new director general hailed from a commercial background, then the move of its main nightly news bulletin to 10pm certainly did. </p> <p>The manner of the announcement to steal ITV's thunder and reschedule the news within two weeks smacked of someone whose tactics had been battle hardened in the trenches of commercial television. The trouble is that if the director general, Greg Dyke, wants to play by commercial rules, he may find commercial rules foisted back upon him. </p> <p>Little more than a week ago the culture secretary, Chris Smith, had urged the BBC to think again about moving its main nightly news to 10pm. Going head-to-head with ITV made no sense, he argued, and threatened to create a \"democratic deficit\" of viewers. </p> <p>Yesterday's announcement that the BBC planned to do just that provoked a furious reaction from Mr Smith who again expressed severe misgivings. While admitting he has no power over the schedule, he in effect put the BBC governors on notice to watch for any slip in quality or viewer numbers. The nightly Nine O'Clock News attracts around 5.2m viewers. </p> <p>The immediate reaction from insiders yesterday was that the governors who rule what the BBC can and cannot do may have just signed their professional death warrants. The BBC's freedom to shift its news output without consultation could not be more different to the situation at ITV, which has battled with regulators for the past two years before being forced to reinstate News at Ten. </p> <p>With the communications white paper being put together at present, some may have counselled the governors to resist raising the hackles of the culture secretary. </p> <p>One of the options for the paper is to abolish the board of governors or at least to limit their powers and bring the BBC under the same regulatory regime as everyone else. If that is the case, the corporation's new found nimbleness may not last. </p> <p>To prove it is fulfilling its public service remit by shifting the news, the BBC has to engage in a difficult balancing act. </p> <p>The corporation argues that a 10pm slot for the main nightly news makes powerful sense editorially. \"It allows the BBC to provide better coverage of parliamentary votes and the business markets as well as breaking stories in America which, with a US general election coming, will be vital to our international coverage,\" said BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland. </p> <p>He maintained that the viewing figures for the main news programme would rise by moving it to 10pm. </p> <p>At the same time, Mr Dyke presented the move as being in line with the BBC's ambition of creating a portfolio of channels for the digital age, including the introduction of the new BBC's 3 and 4. </p> <p>The aim is to make BBC1 a broad based entertainment channel and shunting the main bulletin to a later time slot will clear space. </p> <p>The BBC hopes to fill the 9pm slot with new drama, comedy and factual programming which will be funded by an extra \u00a395m investment to improve the quality of the corporation's main two channels. </p> <p>That too will not be easy. The BBC's inability to release its first schedule yesterday was taken as a clue that programme makers are not ready for the shift in the news - down to the practical problem of most dramas being 50 minutes long. </p> <p>ITV found it difficult to produce a strong slate of programming for the post 10pm slot left vacant by its own news programme. </p> <p>Critics seized on yesterday's move as evidence that the BBC is dumbing down by marginalising its news coverage. Panorama, the corporation's flagship current affairs programme, is at least staying put on BBC1, although the move to Sunday night will attract adverse comment. </p> <p>Last month's fudged agreement between ITV and its regulator, the Independent Television Commission, played into the BBC's hands however and its insistence that it remains committed to serious news coverage. </p> <p>Sir Christopher was quick to make capital of the compromise which means the ITV nightly news will appear at 10pm for only three nights a week. </p> <p>The BBC's main evening news will run six nights a week at 10pm including a new truncated Sunday programme. \"Serious news must have scheduling certainty,\" Sir Christopher said. </p> <p>His dismissal of Mr Smith's comments yesterday, though, may come back to haunt him. He said: \"Chris Smith is a licence fee payer and therefore entitled to his view. </p> <p>\"But it is not in the jurisdiction of the secretary of state to schedule the BBC's news service.\" It could be soon. </p> <p> <strong>Head to Head</strong></p> <p><strong> BBC </strong></p> <p><strong>Presenters </strong> Michael Buerk, Peter Sissons </p> <p><strong> Length of programme</strong> 26 minutes </p> <p><strong> Mix</strong> One-third international coverage </p> <p><strong> Frequency</strong> Six nights a week </p> <p>&lt;str</p> <p><strong>&gt; ITV </strong></p> <p><strong>Presenter</strong> Trevor McDonald. </p> <p><strong> Length of programme </strong> 20 minutes. </p> <p><strong> Mix </strong> Roughly one-third international coverage.

  "<p> I am a lapsed food purist, an ex-paragon, and last week's article by Joanna Blythman on parents and sugar induced in me such a rage that only a new dark chocolate Mars bar could assuage it. </p> <p>Blythman exhorted parents to banish biscuits, honey and even fruit juices from their children's diets. There's nothing she can urge that I haven't done. Neither of my two children ever tasted a molecule of non-homemade baby food. Visitors marvelled at the way my first child downed a plate of spinach. For her second birthday, I baked a sugar-free cake (carob, naturally) so weighted with healthy nutrients that it could have caused serious injury, if hurled. A friend said it wasn't a cake but a statement. </p> <p>Nine years later and I chuckle at the Waitrose checkout, that place where shoppers furtively scrutinise each other's trollies for signs of wealth, greed and loneliness. Mine overflows with as much organic greenery as I can afford - and equal quantities of chocolate. (Why do they call large packs \"family\" size, as if no single individual could ever consume so much? And why do they carry such laughably distant use-by dates, as though anyone could actually keep those mini-sized packets of Maltesers for a year?) </p> <p> My metamorphosis was clinched by two events: my first child starting school, and the birth of my second. School marked the end of the grated-carrot stage of our lives. Never mind that she mainly had packed lunches, food is a social experience: surrounded by children who would only eat fish fingers and pasta without sauce, her own tastes began to migrate towards theirs. Kids want to be like their peers. </p> <p>When her sibling arrived, I also found myself short of that most essential commodity: time. At first, I tried to make interesting meals while also pur\u00e9eing baby food, but as my creations were increasingly rejected with an apologetic \"Sorry, but I don't like it\", we soon found ourselves going the pasta route. </p> <p>As a sociologist as well as a mother, I began to admit personally that which I had always known theoretically - food choice in the real world is a complex issue. What people eat is influenced by more than just nutrition, and is integrally connected with class, history and culture. </p> <p>Money is also critical, since fresh fruit and vegetables are expensive, and not always easily available to car-less parents reliant on local shops. Blythman has been a pioneer in helping us understand how food production has been industrialised, with health being a low priority, so it was curious that this article placed the onus of children eating healthily almost entirely on individual parents. You need to be a well-informed, demon label-reader with infinite energy to live up to that responsibility. </p> <p>We ignore at our peril the psychological dimensions of food. Those parents who placate their complaining children with cakes are often feeding their deprived-child selves. Tolerating their children's fillings is easier for some than tolerating their children's unhappiness or frustration. </p> <p>Dividing foods into good or bad, and struggling to ensure that the latter doesn't contaminate the former, is symptomatic of what psychoanalysts call \"splitting\". Like 50s cold-warriors, we see the risk of invasion from aliens all around. Only now we fear Mars bars instead of martians. Sugar is the new communism. </p> <p>Of course, I'm not a total revisionist. No turkey dinosaur has ever waddled into my home. I'm aspartame-wise, anti-GM and thrilled that my children hate fizzy drinks. This summer - spontaneously (well, almost) - they discovered green salad, and my 11-year-old now makes a mean vinaigrette. </p> <p>But I've also recognised that children want some control over their own food, and my interventions near-as-damn-it made mealtimes into a battleground. So now I give them chocolate-chip cookies when they come home from school. </p> <p>When we first have children, most of us are terrified that every single experience will have a major impact on their life. As they grow older, we realise that this isn't the case. So it is with food. If most of their eating is reasonably healthy, a few Jammy Dodgers aren't going to pollute them. Besides, I don't want to have to hide my own chocolate wrappers.</p>",
  "<p>Looking back at reports at the time - not only in the press, but in social work and legal journals - it is clear that the Children Act 1989 was seen as a sea change in the way we work with children, the start of a new era. </p> <p>Childcare professionals who go back that far will remember the staff reorientation courses. We were going to have to work in a new way. We were going to have to stop looking to the courts to impose solutions. Parents, relatives and professionals were going to have to work together. Creative alternatives were going to have to be found. </p> <p>And if cases did have to go to court, the court process was going to be quicker. Delay is harmful to children (it says so in the act) and the legal process was going to be speeded up to take account of children's developmental timescale (six months for a five-year-old is 10% of their life). \"After the welfare principle, the need to avoid delay is one of the most important policies underlying the bill,\" as Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the then lord chancellor, put it. </p> <p>Children should no longer be subjected to long, emotionally damaging waits in the uncertain limbo of temporary care, while courts ponderously deliberated their fate. A time scale of 12 weeks was generally agreed to be the target. </p> <p>Sadly court delays have turned out to be one of the biggest problems of the post-Children Act era. Figures show that, by the end of 1996, children in England and Wales were on average waiting more than seven months for court decisions in care proceedings - more than twice the average wait immediately prior to the act. The problem was considerably worse in some areas of the country, just as it was in the higher courts which hear a significant minority of care cases (50 weeks on average in the county courts; 64 in the high court). </p> <p>There seem to be several reasons for this. These include inadequate court time, poor case management by judges and a heavy use of \"expert witnesses\", with resulting long delays while reports are written and additional hearings fitted into packed diaries. </p> <p>Another cause of delay is that more parties can be joined to proceedings, and many more issues can be argued about, under the act than under previous legislation. These issues include the precise details of the care plan. </p> <p>This is fertile ground for participants who want to use delay as a tactical weapon - and perhaps also for those who would like to put off the agonising decision to separate a child from their parents. But it is not necessarily good news for children who have to wait months in temporary care without knowing where their future home will be. </p> <p>Nor is it good news for social work agencies, who have to sink more money into the considerable costs of lengthy litigation, and consequently have less left over for the supportive and preventative services that the act was supposed to promote. A local authority's legal costs for a single case can easily run into tens of thousands of pounds. </p> <p>Another likely cause of delay is the sheer volume of proceedings. It was hoped that the act would reduce them, but the number of care applications has risen. The annual total of care proceedings brought to court in England and Wales more than doubled between 1992 and 1998, while there has been a corresponding decline in the use of other orders that were supposed to provide alternatives to care. Care applications were about 40% of all public law applications under the act in 1998, as against less than 20% in 1992. </p> <p>Whatever the intentions of the act, it has ushered in an era in which care proceedings have become more frequent, longer and more likely than before to result in an order that compulsorily removes children from parents. What one makes of that depends, of course, on what one thought of the original objective of deflecting practice away from compulsion and use of the courts. It has been argued that more care proceedings are a good thing because more children are being protected from mistreatment as a result - and even that long proceedings do not matter because cases get a thorough hearing. But while these are legitimate points of view, it cannot be denied that the current situation is not at all what the act intended. </p> <p>Perhaps it is time for a re-think. Was it ever realistic to believe that we could have - and adequately resource - both a far more costly and elaborate court framework and a more community-based and preventative approach? </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Beckett is a lecturer in social work at Anglia Polytechnic University, Cambridge, and a former social work team manager</p>",
  "<p>Day after day, manuscripts reporting medical research pour into the offices of medical journals. The British Medical Journal (BMJ) alone processes more than 6,000 a year. Most submissions are eventually published in one journal or another, and their findings join the body of medical evidence that doctors and patients use to make critical decisions about health. </p> <p>It is an editor's job to pick the best and reject the rest, but what happens when one of \"the rest\" outlines a dangerous experiment that should never have been done, or a case that looks like medical negligence, or a piece of research so unsound that the results will be no use to anyone? </p> <p>The decision not to publish is straightforward enough, but there is a growing consensus that an editor's responsibility does not end there. Patients have wasted their time or, worse, may been harmed. Public funds may have been squandered and an opportunity to do more worthwhile research has been lost. </p> <p>Exactly what editors should do when they suspect wrongdoing, poor judgment, bad medicine or bad science is still an open question. To help them answer it, my colleagues and I at the BMJ have decided to appoint an ethics committee - the first of its kind. This independent group will include people who conduct research, treat patients and interpret the law. In addition, there should be some professional ethicists, with openings for lay members. </p> <p>The committee will be looking critically at everything the journal does, reviewing our existing policies and developing new ones. We still have no formal policy for dealing with whistleblowers, for example, despite being an obvious point of contact for doctors and others with grievances. Perhaps we should. </p> <p>Editors of medical journals live in a morally complex world where vested interests can subvert almost every stage of a study's journey from a researcher's brain to a printed, visible paper. Politicians, researchers, the drugs industry and the journals themselves have competing agendas, and it can be difficult to hear the patient's voice above the noise. </p> <p>A culture of \"publish or perish\" is one well-known example. Publication is a numbers game that doctors in training, as well as established academics, must play. It is one of the most powerful forces shaping medical literature. There are few things more impressive to an appointments committee than a lengthy list of publications, regardless of quality or content. </p> <p>Misdemeanours that result from this pressure include splitting a research paper into its \"least publishable units\" and sending each one to a different journal; publishing the same paper twice by manipulating the data to look different; and including in a paper's list of authors people whose only contribution was to buy the real authors a pint and promise to return the favour next time they write something up. </p> <p>Suspect manuscripts are only half the problem. Peer review, a legacy system of unpaid experts passing judgment on each other's work, is also vulnerable to human weaknesses such as arrogance, envy and naked ambition. For many journals, it is the reviewers who decide what is published - and not all journals insist on full disclosure of competing interests. The BMJ requires reviewers to be open about their financial affairs and affiliations, but how should the editors deal with reviewers who insist that their portfolio of shares in leading drug companies does not affect their judgment on related research? It would be easy to use other reviewers instead, but should the shareholder and his subconscious biases be left at large for other journals to worry about? </p> <p>Mike Farthing, editor of Gut, the leading gastroenterology journal, and chairman of the committee on publication ethics, thinks all this matters very much indeed. He has declared that distortions in medical literature are as damaging to public health as unclean water or a badly regulated food industry. </p> <p>Duplicate and redundant publications gum up the works, making an already chaotic literature even harder to navigate and therefore less useful. </p> <p>Imagine trying to find out which drug works best in psychoses, such as schizophrenia, when the data from a handful of clinical trials testing a new drug appear in various disguises, in several journals, none of which is cross-referenced. </p> <p>Reviewers or editors who fail to own up to competing interests, or think they are above all that, add yet more bias to a research effort already knocked out of shape. </p> <p>An ethics committee will help us think harder about the public health impact of what we do - and you may be able to help. If you think you could serve as a lay member of the BMJ's ethics committee, please get in touch before next Monday. <br></p> <p>\u0095 Alison Tonks is an assistant editor of the BMJ.

  "<p>In his July spending review, Gordon Brown announced he was putting aside \u00a3450m for preventative work, of which \u00a370m over three years would be for a children's fund. Based on 50 networks in deprived areas, the fund would aim to improve the living standards of families, involve hard-to-reach groups and widen the experiences of poor children. </p> <p>So far so good. But now the Treasury has released a letter which explains how the networks will be administered. My fear is that its approach will lessen the fund's impact. The 50 networks will each be run by a voluntary organisation \"with strong experience in grant-giving in that region\". Locally-controlled community projects do not possess this experience. </p> <p>Allocation of the fund's grants looks likely to be placed with national or regional voluntary societies which do valuable work, but which are usually managed outside the deprived neighbourhoods. The danger is that, in making grants, they will favour bodies like themselves. The losers will be community projects with committees, staff and children who most understand local needs. </p> <p>The explanatory letter states that \"the aim of the local network is to empower communities, families and children\". Yet, if the networks are dominated by large organisations, or the usual quango figures, then no empowerment will occur. Of course the networks will allocate some money to local projects, but this merely perpetuates the charity system of the privileged deciding what the deprived can do. </p> <p>Whoever gets the money, the scale of the children's fund is too small. At its height, each network will have \u00a3800,000. The Treasury points out that \"most grants are likely to be small, in the hundreds and low thousands of pounds\". </p> <p>This miserly approach perpetuates the myth that community projects require a few quid for a second-hand photocopier. In fact, they most need grants for salaries. Their staff are adept at running food co-ops which help families improve living standards; they are skilled at preventing youngsters from going into care. The Cedarwood Trust, in North Shields, Tyne and Wear, successfully helps low-income families. Its annual expenditure is about \u00a3140,000, mostly for salaries. It does not need a photocopier. </p> <p>My proposal is that the 50 networks be under the control of representatives of the deprived areas. Equipped with the whole \u00a3450m, they should allocate money to projects which are genuinely controlled by residents. Such community projects are responsive to what low-income families and children want - the right children's fund.</p>",
  "<p>Pheasants: hundreds, perhaps thousands of them, tottering around the hillside, clucking their clockwork alarm call and flapping off in a pathetic attempt at wild pheasanthood. The pheasant shooting season began on October 1 and a hail of lead awaits these birds. But another storm surrounds them: pheasants have friends and resistance to the annual slaughter is under way. </p> <p>Cwm mountain is a beautiful and enigmatic cluster of the Y Wenallt, Maes y castell and Gallt y Goedhwch hilltops rising 200 metres above the valley of Cwm Nant-y-meichiaid in mid-Wales. The young pheasants here have been intensively reared in a game farm, held in cages like free-range chickens then released on to the hill. </p> <p>With its wooden lower slopes and open sheep-grazed tops, Cwm mountain is like many other hills nearby, but it has strange fenced patches of brassicas - kale, rape and turnip - some covering a couple of acres; feeding hoppers are dotted around; the woods conceal huge fenced enclosures and a new road for 4x4s is blazed across its face. The pheasant business has a profound impact on this ancient landscape, creating an eerie paranoia, broken only by barrages of gunfire when the shoot is on. </p> <p>Although the odd bit of shooting has been practised here for years and there was a pre-war estate shoot on Cwm mountain, these pheasants are part of a new phenomenon. The social make-up of the countryside has changed dramatically over the last few decades and the acceptance of traditional field sports is being challenged. </p> <p>The farmers who own the mountain and have sold or leased the shooting rights see it as a way of supplementing their income during troubled times. The majority of people who live around the mountain are against it. They, apart from a dry-stone waller, do not work on the land. They are teachers, artists, engineers and business people; quite a few are retired. </p> <p>\"It took 36 years in the Royal Navy to get this,\" says Kit Davidson, secretary of the Cwm Mountain Residents, standing outside his restored farmhouse where he and his wife have lived for the past two years. \"When I started my objection to the pheasant shoot I was a Nimby,\" he admits, \"but after a lot of research and exposure to the protest here I now object to sport shooting on welfare and environmental grounds everywhere. Now I'm an environmentalist\". </p> <p>The position of the protesters is tenuous. Some have lived here all their lives, some are recent incomers; they all want good relations with their neighbours but they all share a passion for this place, threatened by what they see as a cruel sport which they fear also puts them, their families and wildlife at risk. \"Townie. Get back to the city where you came from. You English are all the same,\" yell a van load of beaters at an impromptu protest against a recent shoot. </p> <p>This irony is not lost on the Cwm Mountain Residents who are protesting against the shooters coming out from English cities. A protester, Kath Morell, was warned off land she has walked on for many years by a gamekeeper. \"He effed and blinded at me and said I should go back where I came from,\" Morell said, \"but I've been a teacher in a local school for 30 years\". </p> <p>\"We are saturated with pheasants and partridge, there are three times as many of them this year and the shooting goes on around the houses,\" says Tom Hughes, a Welsh-speaking retired headmaster and local historian. \"I can't see the point, killing birds that have been artificially reared like this, it's disgusting.\" </p> <p>So what is the point? The man behind the Cwm mountain shoot, and 30 others in the vicinity, is Christopher Williams. I ask Williams if I can accompany him on a shoot to find out what it is like but he refuses; because of adverse publicity the shooting syndicate he represents does not want a journalist around. He will not say who the members of the syndicate are, how many birds have been bred and released, or what kind of financial investments have been made. </p> <p>Williams is not about to give away any commercial information and is worried that any information he gives will be seized on by the Cwm Mountain Residents. \"They just want to stick the knife in,\" he complains. His shoots, which involve three syndicates, are not, Williams insists, about making money but about providing legitimate sport for friends. </p> <p>Although protesters claim to have discovered carbon dioxide fire extinguishers at badger setts, Williams says nothing untoward is going on and claims the shoots provide employment and put money into the local economy. \"Controlling vermin like crows, magpies, stoats and weasels maintains the balance in the countryside,\" he says. \"All the major conservation organisations agree that shooting benefits wildlife, so there can be no environmental objection. We abide by the law and sportsman's rules and behave in the proper way.\" So what is the sport in killing these birds? \"A sportsman shoots to kill cleanly,\" Williams explains, \"but if killing is absolutely certain then the sportsman doesn't shoot, there has to be the element of doubt for it to be sporting\". </p> <p>The protest from the Cwm Mountain Residents is a new experience for Williams and, says a spokesman from the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, it is rare to have organised opposition like this anywhere in the country. There is a reluctance, even from environmental organisations, to take on the shooting lobby. Unlike fox hunting, pheasant shooting has not yet raised much public passion. This may be about to change. </p> <p>The animal rights and anti-cruelty organisation Animal Aid has just launched a report (The Killing Fields: the pheasant shooting industry) and its devastating impact on \"game\" birds and British wildlife. This report claims that pheasant shooting is really a multi-million pound agribusiness which subjects millions of birds to the mutilations, disease and stress of intensive rearing. About 36 million pheasants are shot each year but a further 12 million suffer injuries and are never recovered. This also involves the killing of five million wild birds and mammals in so-called \"vermin\" control and often results in the death of protected species. About 75,000 metric tonnes of lead shot falls on the countryside each year. </p> <p>Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, says: \"I don't believe the public has any idea of the scale and squalid nature of the modern pheasant industry and its devastating impact on the countryside. I commend the efforts of the Cwm Mountain Residents in their valiant battle to protect the ecology and tranquillity of their beautiful part of Britain.\" <br></p> <p>\u0095 Cwm Mountain Residents can be contact ed by email at: <a href=\"mailto:cwmmountain@madasafish.com\"> cwmmountain@madasafish.com</a> and the Animal Aid website is at <a href=\"http://www.animalaid.org.uk\">www.animalaid.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Most retiring politicians' memoirs, the parting shots of accumulated Normans, attract only passing attention and head straight for the remainder shelves. Michael Heseltine's Life In The Jungle (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a320) promised to be different: the millionaire politician who had toppled Thatcher only to have his cherished ambition of becoming PM thwarted. A story of Shakespearian power and drama. The big reviewing beasts were rounded up to pass judgment and did not disappoint. </p> <p><strong>Andrew Marr</strong>, in the <strong>Observer</strong>, amusingly painted the typical politician's memoir: \"The early life, with its interesting revelations of family eccentricity and tough, ambition-forging times, is followed by the Oxbridge years, when lifelong political friendships and contacts are formed. Then comes the breathless account of the first constituency campaign, the charmingly self-mocking account of that terrifying maiden speech, the gruff advice from Sir Old Salt MP - what a character! - then the tramp, tramp, tramp of departmental achievements. As he tramps, Our Hero absolves himself from any errors other memoirs attack him for, and energetically reheats ancient grudges. Wives appear in a blur. Children provide a few paragraphs of amusing background colour. A couple of imperfectly remembered jokes are hastily inserted after the first read-through. And - hey presto! - it's time to call the chap at the Daily Mail who apparently pays such a lot to extract the microwaved grudges. Strangely, Our Hero has no examples of his own of petty spite, failure of vision or genuine remorse to record.\" </p> <p>So much for the Normans. What about Hezza's book? \"This autobiography follows the pattern but it is vastly better than most,\" said Marr. \"Heseltine says he does not find writing (or reading) easy and he is not an exciting prose writer. But, presumably thanks to veteran journalist Anthony Howard, who has been a close friend since student days and helped with it, this is one of the most elegant, politically informative and, in the widest sense, literate reviews of a political life in many years. It is not up there with the great autobiographies of Healey or Jenkins, but it stands easy comparison with Thatcher, Major or Lawson.\" </p> <p>Elegant was not the word that sprang to the mind of <strong>John Campbell</strong>, biographer of Margaret Thatcher and Edward Heath, who reviewed the book in the <strong>Independent</strong>. \"The whole book is a let-down. Where is the flamboyance, the showmanship, the relish that made Heseltine such an exciting politician? It is well known - and duly acknowledged - that he was helped in the writing by his old friend Anthony Howard. Yet whereas grey John Major turned out in his autobiography to be a deft and disarming writer, Heseltine the conference orator and combative interviewee is reduced to anonymity on the page.\" Campbell drew a large conclusion from Heseltine's uninspiring prose style: \"Perhaps that really is the man: a much more decent, cautious and conventional character than his swashbuckling image suggests. He loves birds and his trees, but has no interest in any of the arts. He has been happily married for nearly 40 years, and has no time for the Archers, Aitkens and others who messed up their careers and the Tory government by sexual and financial misdemeanours. The legend of Tarzan swinging through the political jungle is curiously diminished. Perhaps deputy prime minister was his level after all.\" </p> <p><strong>Hugo Young</strong>, in the <strong>Guardian</strong>, reached a similar conclusion, on both the memoirist and the politician: \"Although it is a long book, it's a disappointingly small one. The horizons remain unaddressed: many large events he saw and took part in do not feature here. A man who seemed to be a quintessential exponent of high politics has written a memoir that, to a large extent, eschews them. \"It offers mini-glimpses that startle and reveal. Heseltine wanted Chris Patten, instead of going to Hong Kong, to be the first recipient of a constitutional innovation, and take a one-term life peerage prior to fighting the next election. He says that when he failed to beat Major for the leadership, he was \u00efin tears'. He reveals that the Dome could have been an even worse catastrophe: there was a time when Hyde Park was thought to be the place for it. But ultimately the book exposes a narrower man than the big politician who wrote it. Or perhaps not. Maybe, in the end, the minister as manager, as armchair quarter-master, as urban renewer, as competitiveness addict at the DTI, as tunnel-vision European, is what Michael Heseltine was. Not the supreme leader deprived of his just deserts, but perhaps a man without the spaciousness for the highest of high politics.\" </p> <p>The Times and Telegraph opted to have the book reviewed by former colleagues rather than political commentators. <strong>John Major</strong>, in the <strong>Times</strong>, was dull. No evidence here of writerly deftness. \"Michael Heseltine is one of the most exotic of postwar politicians and his autobiography does not disappoint,\" said the former PM. \"Surprisingly revealing, dotted with characteristic bon mots, it contains the political substance that lay beneath his flamboyant presentation. In the parts of his narrative of which I have personal knowledge, his account is balanced and fair without embroidering to his own advantage.\" He went on, at tiresome length, to discuss those parts of the narrative: the Westland affair has never seemed more soporific. </p> <p><strong>Norman Tebbit</strong>, in the <strong>Telegraph</strong> (now there's a surprise), was far livelier and much more revealing, though mainly about his own capacity to hate. \"As the Millennium Dome approaches total meltdown its creator publishes his autobiography,\" Tebbit began. \"Pre-sold as the book that would do the dirt on Margaret Thatcher, it only repeats - with added hysteria - Heseltine's oft-repeated refrain: 'I was right; she was wrong.' Long passages of the book are turgid, not to say self-serving. How I rebuilt London Docklands; how I saved Liverpool; how I saved Concorde; almost built Maplin airport; cleared the dossers off the streets of London; and many other triumphs. Above all, How I Saved My Party and The Nation from the poisonous cheat Margaret Thatcher. It is not exactly a bag of laughs, although few of us who know Heseltine will not be moved to laughter by the revelation of his school nickname - 'Great Tit'.\" Tebbit plunged the knife in in his intro and spent the rest of the review twisting it. \"There is really nothing new in this book. No smoking gun in Margaret Thatcher's hand. Extraordinarily, Heseltine says that once she was brought down her 'poison' was drained and all was well. At the time of her fall in 1990 the Tory majority was 101. By 1997, 210 Tories had lost their seats and Labour had gained 189, giving Blair a 179-seat majority. Heseltine's political epitaph must be: 'He brought down Margaret Thatcher and raised up Tony Blair.' Yet he remains happy with his work. It is a tragic story of obsession and vanity.\" </p> <p>In terms of telling you whether the book is any good, Tebbit's knife-wielding is completely useless. But as a bilious rant it's a riot, and certainly cheered up my morning train journey into work. Blind prejudice in reviewers, while despicable, can be jolly good fun. </p>",

  "She tries her hardest. In her 41 years, she has changed her colour, gone to war, played soccer and is even now running for president. But still there is no peace for Barbie. Last week, she failed in an attempt in a Los Angeles court to stop a photographer from using her in an exhibition of his work. Utah photographer Tom Forsythe has used Barbie in a series of pictures which he is exhibiting around the country to make a point about consumerism in the United States. In his prepared statement for the court hearing Forsythe said: \"my Barbie series of photos critiques the Barbie doll and the shallow, consumerist values fostered and perpetuated by it\". <p>Forsythe had not expected that Mattell would go to court to stop his exhibitions but in August they indicated that they would be seeking an injunction to prevent him from making use of their product on the grounds of breach of copyright and trademark. </p> <p>The American Civil Liberties Union then decided to come in on Forsythe's behalf and a legal team from San Francisco worked on the case pro bono. They argued that what Mattell was trying to do was a breach of Forsythe's right to free speech under the first amendment. </p> <p>Now United States district court judge Ronald S Lew has turned down their request for an injunction on the grounds that he did not believe that their law suit against Forsythe would ultimately succeed. </p> <p>This is something of a set-back for Mattell who have had a pretty successful track record at stopping people from messing around with the doll they created in 1959. They do not seem to take the view that the various different things that have been done with Barbie may be homages to her. Forsythe described the law suit as a \"surreal experience.\" </p> <p>Barbie has been criticised in the past for presenting girls with an impossible shape to aspire to (unless they happen to be under 12 inches tall) and for not adapting more swiftly to the times. But she is clearly determined not to let the latest set-back case her dismay. The newest Barbie on offer is called Celebration Barbie and is available in Afro-American, Latina and Caucasian. </p> <p>And just in case any other artists or photographers have plans to take advantage of the court decision, they should know that also on offer now is Detective Barbie. But surely the logical step would be to roll out a Judge Barbie doll, complete with gown and gavel.

What about the rest of Jack Straw's record at the Home Office? </p> <p> Police numbers down, crime up, violent crime soaring, the asylum system in chaos, spies laughing at the country they betrayed\u0085 </p> <p> When we were debating rising crime under this Government, I asked Jack Straw whether crime would fall again. He said: 'That depends on the criminals.' </p> <p> I thought it was traditional for the British people to rely on their government to cut crime, not on the criminals. It cannot be common sense to fight crime with fewer crimefighters. It cannot be common sense, when the police have spent time and effort arresting people, to see the criminal back on the street before the police officer. It cannot be common sense to let prisoners sit around in idleness. It cannot be common sense to allow persistent young menaces to grow up with the belief that they are untouchable at law. It cannot be common sense to arrest the householder instead of the burglar. </p> <p> We need common sense. </p> <p> This country needs a well-motivated, strong police force that can protect everyone, regardless of race, colour or creed. But when the police have done their job, the public must be protected by proper, effective sentencing. </p> <p> When those sentences include custody, protecting the public doesn't end at the prison gate. It means work and education inside prisons to give inmates the skills to lead a law-abiding life outside. </p> <p> You are already aware that we have promised to restore police numbers. But numbers alone are not the only answer. We must make sure that every single policeman makes the most effective use of every minute of his time. Yet officers regularly tell me that they can spend an entire shift processing a single criminal through custody, and that they have to fill in the same information on form after form. Indeed, from what they tell me I can only conclude that the police have got more form than the criminals they arrest. For too long, politicians have observed this and done nothing. It is time to relieve the police of this crippling burden. </p> <p> It is plain common sense that a policeman should come into the station, deliver his prisoner with a short statement and go straight back onto the beat to arrest more criminals. And that's what's going to happen on my watch. And if that means taking a large part of the custody function away from the police, that's what I'll do. </p> <p> So we're going to restore the numbers. And we're going to make sure they spend their time more effectively. And we're going to make sure that they spend their time in the rural areas as well as the urban. </p> <p> Many rural people feel isolated from the forces of law and order. They rarely see their local bobby. Where there is an emergency, they wait far too long for a response. </p> <p> For those who live in sparsely populated areas, this is a real, live problem. So I've been looking for real, live solutions. I believe that there are lots of ways that we can get visible policing in our countryside. Through retained police officers, part-time police officers, specials, greater use of retired officers, and through 'cops in shops'. </p> <p> Cops in shops is a very simple initiative, which I saw in Washington. The officer doesn't go back to the station to write up his reports, he writes them up in shops and other public places. This has a threefold advantage. First of all, he's visible. Secondly, he can interact with the community. And thirdly, he is a deterrent. </p> <p> One of the reasons why we have such problems in recruiting is that very often, young people lose interest between the time they leave school and the time they are old enough to join the police. So I want to re-introduce a police cadet force which will not only provide a recruiting and training ground for both the regular police and the specials, but will fundamentally change young people's attitude towards the police at a time in their lives when it is most important. </p> <p> Instead of being tough on criminals, Tony Blair and Jack Straw operate a revolving door prisons policy. </p> <p> On Jack Straw's own tagging scheme, criminals sentenced to six months get out of jail in six weeks - even John Prescott gets through more of his sentences. </p> <p> And so 23,000 convicts have been let out early. </p> <p> Including 200 convicted killers </p> <p> Thousands of other violent criminals. </p> <p> Nearly 150 convicted of assaulting police. </p> <p> More than 900 robbers </p> <p> Over 2,100 burglars </p> <p> 3,000 drug dealers </p> <p> And when, but for Jack Straw's measure, they should have been in jail, these criminals have committed even more crimes - over 700 more. </p> <p> Dozens of burglaries and thefts </p> <p> Threats to kill </p> <p> Drug dealing </p> <p> Even two rapes </p> <p> The next Conservative government will scrap this tagging scheme, this mammoth insult to victims. </p> <p> I'm against early release in all but one case. There is only one early release that I will be prepared to see in the public interest. That's Jack Straw's early release from the chains of office - and Tony Blair and the rest of the Labour party with him. </p> <p> And instead, we will introduce honesty in sentencing. With the complete abolition of automatic early release. </p> <p> Sentences will say what they mean and mean what they say. </p> <p> Discounts will have to be earned and will not be substantial - unlike now. </p> <p> Where a custodial sentence is passed, we will ensure that there is a programme of rehabilitation in place. Too many offenders who are sent to prison go on to re-offend. </p> <p> By ensuring that they have an alternative to a continuation of their life of crime, we can better protect the public. </p> <p> Idle prisons are breeding grounds for the disease of crime. We will move towards a full working day in all prisons, based on self-financing workshops that take on real work which real employers want in the real world. Prisoners' wages will go towards the cost of their upkeep, the support of their families, savings to give them a start when they leave prison, and reparations to the victims of crime. </p> <p> It is all about protecting the public. </p> <p> And we've got to start with the young criminals. We will take the young menaces off the streets, away from the environment that has failed them, and give them a real chance to change. Last year I set out proposals to do this, placing them in secure training and giving them a stable regime and a real chance to change. This year, I want to look beyond young criminals, at the single biggest cause of crime, particularly but not exclusively amongst the young. </p> <p> The single biggest cause of crime in this country today is drugs. </p> <p> Children are 20% of our population but they are 100% of our future. Drugs are the cancer that is eating away at our country and threatening those children and that future. </p> <p> It's not our children who are the only victims. Crime costs this country \u00a350bn a year - and at least a third of all crimes are drug related. Eighty per cent of burglaries are motivated by drugs. </p> <p> One third of acquisitive crime is drug-related, costing victims over \u00a32bn a year. </p> <p> More than 100,000 people are convicted or cautioned for drug offences every year. </p> <p> Even if they end up in court, many get a conditional discharge or a small fine. </p> <p> Not exactly tough. </p> <p> What do the other parties offer? </p> <p> The Liberal Democrats toy with legalisation. And they want to end the tough mandatory sentences for drug dealers. </p> <p> In other words, give in. What they want to do is against all common sense. </p> <p> Labour promised a war against drugs. </p> <p> What have they done with the drug dealers? Given them the get out of jail free card. </p> <p> 23,000 criminals let out on special early release scheme, and more than 3,000 have been drug dealers or traffickers. </p> <p> Drug dealers who on average got 22 months' jail. </p> <p> Under Labour they served nine months. </p> <p> So what will we do? </p> <p> We have already pledged tougher sentences for drug dealers who sell to our children and a crackdown on drugs in and around our schools. And, needless to say, we will scrap the get out of jail free card for 3,000 drug dealers. </p> <p> Today I am able to announce a new policy. Earlier this year, I visited New York, where under Mayor Giuliani crime has plummeted. Although we can't replicate exactly what I saw there, we can learn the lessons of tackling crime head on and not conceding a centimetre to the criminals. So today, I can announce a new policy. A policy that means no quarter for those whose trade is dealing in human misery, despair and even death. </p> <p> And so, from the possession of the most minimal amount of soft drugs right up the chain to the large importer, there will be no hiding place. There will be zero tolerance. </p> <p> Parents want it. Schools need it. Our future demands it. The next Conservative government will do it. </p> <p> What does it mean? It means zero tolerance of possession. No more getting away with just a caution, no more hoping that a blind eye will be turned. If someone possesses drugs, the minimum for a first offence will be a fixed penalty of \u00a3100. But not for a second offence. Then it's into court. </p> <p> And no more claiming that no matter what amount you've got on you, it's for personal use. Over and above the smallest amount, the charge will be substantial possession, and the penalties applicable will be of a range comparable to those for dealing. </p> <p> And as for the suppliers, we will put them out of business. </p> <p> We will dedicate police resources and police officers to identifying and cleaning up forever those houses and other places where regular supply takes place. And the replacement suppliers, and their replacements, and their replacements, until there are no more replacements. </p> <p> Yes, this will require extra money, yes this will require extra police officers, and yes they will be forthcoming. That will be money well spent. </p> <p> And there are other aspects of our drugs laws which we need to change. Why do you lose your licence for drink-driving, but not for drugs driving? In future, anybody caught driving with illegal substances in their bloodstream will be subject to a mandatory ban. Why should it be that you have illegal drugs in your pocket, you're guilty of possession, but when they're in your bloodstream, you're guilty of nothing? </p> <p> Why do we have laws against opium dens which don't apply to crack houses? </p> <p> Zero tolerance of the biggest scourge in our society today. That's what's going to happen on my watch. </p> <p> Other things will change also. Our asylum system will be completely overhauled and we will automatically house all new applicants in secure reception centres. It's extraordinary, but Labour call that racist. Yet the biggest loser in their system is the genuine refugee who comes to this country with not only a legal but a moral case for a safe haven, and finds himself clogged up in queue which has hit more than 100,000 cases - double what Labour inherited. If the message goes out to those who simply seek to play our system that in future they will be detained, dealt with speedily and removed, they will cease to come and we will be able to process the genuine applicant more quickly. However, for the real refugee, reception centres will provide a one-stop point of expertise in education for the children, language support, and social services support. </p> <p> At the moment such people, with all their vulnerability and needs are turned out to take their chance in areas where the local authorities have no experience in coping and where the provision of such services is a hit and miss affair. </p> <p> Let me make clear to Tony Blair what I believe - what is my 'irreducible core'. </p> <p> If you're asking me to stand by and see the genuine refugee stuck in a queue with tens of thousands of other applications; </p> <p> If you're asking me to tolerate a situation where that man waits months or years for a decision on his case while Ministers dither and officials shuffle paper; </p> <p> If you're asking me to put up with a shambolic system of support which is letting down both the refugees and the local councils and the local people who have to pick up the pieces, then vote for the other man, because I won't do it. </p> <p> Letting down genuine refugees. I don't think I could do that. Could you? </p> <p> Releasing 23,000 prisoners extra-early. I don't think I could do that. Could you? </p> <p> Cut police numbers when crime is rising. I don't think I could that. Could you? </p> <p> Surrender to the drugs menace. We couldn't do that. We shouldn't do that. </p> <p> We won't do that.</p>",
  "We were a mere nine minutes into the first presidential debate between Al Gore and George W Bush when the Gore campaign, monstrously efficient as ever, sallied out into the media hall at the University of Massachusetts with their first rapid rebuttal of an evening that would become an orgy of spin. <p>Reality Check: Big Government was the title on what was to be the first of over a dozen handouts from the two campaign teams to the media over the next 90 minutes. The Gore campaign workers, dressed in red T-shirts bearing the words \"Let the day begin...\", alternated around our desks with Bush aides offering Setting the Record Straight handouts. </p> <p>The standard cliche about American presidential debates is that they represent the long-awaited moment when the electorate pauses from its work, rest and play to focus on deciding which way to vote on November 7. But the truth is that the debates are not so much a battle for the voters, as a battle to shape the media's message to the voters. They are, in fact, nothing less than the Olympics of spin. </p> <p>It's true that somewhere between 60 and 75m Americans were expected to watch at least part of last night's first Gore-Bush confrontation in Boston. All over America, people will have formed their own conclusions last night. Yet the verdict which the two campaigns crave above all is the media's judgment that one side or the other was the winner in the contest. </p> <p>To that end, the two sides deployed more political firepower on a single evening last night than the Sydney Olympic organisers set off fireworks to mark the end of this years Games. </p> <p>As the end of the debate neared, both parties began massing their top spinmeisters in a long open area next to the press desks, known as Spin Alley. Each spinner's presence in Spin Alley is marked by a placard, carried by an acolyte, on which the person's name is clearly marked and held aloft. For the Democrats, there were top level pros such as Bill Daley, Bob Shrum, John Kerry and Donna Shalala, For the Republicans, Karen Hughes, John Engler, George Pataki and Condoleeza Rice. And dozens more on either side. </p> <p>There's only one question that anyone in the press ever seems to ask in the scrums which form around each spinner. How do you think it went? \"He did a wonderful job. The country can be as proud of him as I am,\" said Dorothy Koch, who just happens to be George W's younger sister. \"The country saw Al Gore as a man who has a sense of the future,\" said Shrum, who is the vice-president's campaign strategist. \"Gore is like Forrest Gump,\" suggested Engler, the witty and convivial Michigan governor. </p> <p>If the presidential debates are really going to shift the momentum of the 2000 presidential contest, then it's here in Spin Alley that the battle will be fought and won. Both sides calculate that their investment in big-name quote merchants will help to tip the struggle for today's headlines their way. And not just today's. Once it becomes the received wisdom that Gore or Bush was the winner, then the perception is hard to shift. </p> <p>The media can, of course, make the wrong call on these occasions. A couple of weeks ago, Rick Lazio and Hillary Clinton squared off in a televised debate in New York where they are rivals for the vacant US Senate seat next month. Lazio was aggressive, made a lot of strong points. Most of the media awarded him the victory, only to discover that the polls tipped sharply in Clinton's favour over the next few days. </p> <p>Last night, no one seemed very sure who had \"won\". The reality is that neither of them did. Neither man forced his opponent to burst into tears, or to admit snorting cocaine, or to confess to fathering an illegitimate child. No one came up with a killer one-liner, or good joke or a well-crafted put-down. The debate was, in fact, a faithful reflection of the campaign of which it is part. Gore was knowledgeable, focused and impressive in a not particularly striking kind of way.</p> <p>Bush was likeable, tenacious, stuck to his lines and was never quite as bad as he appears capable of being. Both men lived to fight - or to debate - another day. My own sense is that Gore got a bit more out of the Boston debate than Bush did. Gore kept to his issues, while Bush was sometimes rambling and, at the end, negatively personal. Gore is moving ahead once more in the polls after Bush's late September recovery. Last night's debate will not have put the brakes on that new momentum. But you do have to wonder whether all that spinning really makes any significant difference at all.</p>",
  "<p>A tour of Pakistan might not be top of England's wish list, but it is certainly making Pakistani players and fans lick their lips in anticipation. It is 13 years since Mike Gatting's late fielding change so infuriated umpire Shakoor Rana that it grabbed the headlines, wasted a day's play, and earned the England players a \u00a31000 \"hardship\" bonus that deeply offended their hosts. </p> <p> At first glance it might have looked like a couple of people singing and dancing. It wasn't. As barely decipherable expletives (in English and Punjabi) exploded from square leg, and chubby fingers exchanged jabs of hate, sporting rivalry turned into outright enmity. Sadly, this legacy has been difficult to shake.</p> <p> The 1987-88 tour had become intolerable for England, and matched the popular image of Pakistan at the time: a hell-hole for visitors, a stamping ground for biased umpires, and a holiday destination for annoying mothers-in-law. The Pakistanis, naturally, had a different perspective. To them, England were a bunch of whingers insulting their homeland and full of arrogance towards local officials, oblivious to the injustices that Pakistan teams suffered in England. Looming large behind the fracas was the perennial tussle between former colony and colonial master.</p> <p> England haven't played a Test in Pakistan since 1987-88. You have to go back to 1982 for the last time England won a series against them, and that was at home. Umpire David Constant arguably sealed Pakistan's fate at Headingley that year with an unconvincing bat/pad decision against Sikander Bakht. On their tour of England in 1987 Pakistan unsuccessfully campaigned to have Constant removed from the Test umpiring panel. With England so sure of the quality of their umpires and so dismissive of those from the subcontinent, England's 1987-88 tour of Pakistan was a white-coat nightmare waiting to happen.</p> <p> And it wasn't sweet dreams afterwards either. The ball-tampering furore was at its nastiest during Pakistan's 1992 tour, then Imran Khan, Ian Botham and Allan Lamb slugged it out in the High Court four years later. </p> <p> Umpiring disputes, intimidatory bowling and crowd trouble have all been regular themes. I doubt, too, if Wasim Akram and Channel 4's Mark Nicholas shared a joke during their commentary stints about the time the touring Pakistanis reduced Nicholas, then of Hampshire, to tears with childish \"pretty boy\" jibes.</p> <p> And there's more. World Cups have been flashpoints. When Pakistan won in 1992, rain saved them from certain elimination in the preliminary round. Their unlucky opponents on that day, England, had run out of steam by the time the teams met again in the final. But the air was so thick with abuse that if the new sledging penalty had been in force then, England might just have won. </p> <p> Four years later, the one-day circus moved to south Asia. England were dull and Michael Atherton was in the middle of one of his more inscrutable phases. Irritated by a local journalist at a press conference, Atherton called his questioner a \"buffoon\". Pakistani ears heard \"baboon\", and all hell broke loose. Fingers jabbed accusingly all over again. By 1999, match-fixing had taken hold: was it fix or fair? Only Pakistan and the cricket mafiosi know the answer. Either way, England have made it clear that Pakistan's handling of the affair far from convinces them. Pakistan, in turn, feel persecuted, not least by England.</p> <p> So there is hurt on both sides. But it throbs more forcefully in Pakistani minds. Which begs the question: does this series mean as much to England as it does to Pakistan? Before this summer, I would have said no. But with England rampant and a growing reputation to nurture, we can expect a fascinating contest. England have a chance: Pakistan's recent home record is abysmal. </p> <p> There is a difference this year, however. Pakistan believe that the match-fixing scandal is behind them and captain Moin Khan and coach Javed Miandad have the team's confidence. Miandad was captain when England toured in 1987-88 and he is not one to forget the jabbing fingers of history. That tour also cost him the captaincy. All this augurs badly for England - it might not be as tough as it used to be in Pakistan, but it will not be far off. And there's bound to be some controversy. Life would be so dull without it, especially when England play Pakistan.

  "<p>The oeuvre of bandy-legged clown icon <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Chaplin,+Charles\">Charlie Chaplin</a> is up for grabs, after the worldwide distributor of his works to the small screen opted not to extend its existing exclusive rights. The TV and video rights to the star's canon now revert back to Chaplin's family company Roy Export, which is now seeking a new distributor to take on the job. Films now available, according to bulletins in the Hollywood Reporter trade paper, include Chaplin's first feature-length talkie, The Great Dictator, and silent classics such as The Kid and The Gold Rush.</p> <p>The decision by De Dam Films not to renew its 30-year relationship with Roy Export - who have held theatrical rights to Chaplin's movies since the early-90s - has been taken amicably, insist both parties. Says Mo Rothman, who runs the distributor, \"the titles in the collection are true cinematic treasures and we have greatly enjoyed our long connection with the little tramp\". Josephine Chaplin, the actor's daughter, said \"I know my father was really pleased with the successful re-issue of his films in the 70s thanks to Mo, and although he was no longer there to witness the last twenty years of Mo's distribution period, he would have been very happy.\"</p> <p>The relinquishing of rights to fifteen of Chaplin's classics leaves De Dam in control of a remaining twenty-eight 'featurettes', secured under a separate deal with Chaplin's company Black Inc.</p>",
  "Mark Chapman, the man who shot dead John Lennon 20 years ago because he wanted to be a somebody, lost his first bid for parole yesterday. The board felt he was still unusually interested in fame. <p>Chapman, who has apologised to Lennon's family and says that he is well again and should be released to tour the world playing his own music, has almost completed his minimum sentence at Attica prison in upstate New York. </p> <p>Chapman, 45, was interviewed yesterday morning at the prison by three parole board members, said Tom Grant, a spokesman for the New York state division of parole. He was told of the rejection four hours later. </p> <p>In its ruling, the board called Chapman's killing of Lennon \"calculated and unprovoked\". In addition to being one of the most famous musicians in the world, Lennon was also a \"husband and a father of two young children\", it said. </p> <p>\"Your most vicious and violent act was apparently fuelled by your need to be acknowledged,\" the board added. \"During your parole hearing, this panel noted your continued interest in maintaining your notoriety.\" </p> <p>The rejection came as no surprise to Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of New York, which monitors prisons. </p> <p>He said: \"If Jesus Christ returned to Earth for the sole purpose of decreeing that it would be appropriate to release Mark Chapman, the parole board wouldn't be willing to take the political heat they would get by doing it.\" </p> <p>But even if Chapman were not a notorious murderer, his chances of release in December would still have been remote. Parole has been granted in the past three years to only 17 of the 303 people serving time in the state for murder or attempted murder and making their first application. </p> <p>A poll conducted by the cable channel Court TV, which showed a documentary including an interview with Chapman the night before the closed-door hearing, showed that only 6% of respondents believed he should be set free. </p> <p>The board received written submissions, one of them from Yoko Ono, Lennon's widow. It is known that she said she and the couple's son Sean would not feel safe if Chapman were let out of prison. </p> <p>It will now be two years before Chapman can reapply. </p> <p>On the Court TV documentary, Chapman talked of the murder - outside Lennon's Manhattan home in 1980 - as though he were describing the actions of someone else. He said of the day of the shooting: \"When you look at it, here was a man who was a blowing cauldron, very lucid and very clear. Yet my stomach and heart were disintegrating.\" </p> <p>Jack Jones, who conducted the interview, said: \"Mark is a creature of fiction to a large extent. He had this fantasy world where he was the fifth Beatle in his mind. </p> <p>\"From an early age he had an elaborate world of little people living in his bedroom. When he was happy and things were going his way he would reward the little people by playing Beatles music. Only Beatles music. He was also eliminating and punishing millions of little people.\"</p>",
  "<p>Human rights observers in Prague are expressing concern over allegations that protesters still behind bars have been mistreated after last week's anti-globalisation demonstrations in the Czech capital. </p> <p>Assertions by released detainees that sexual and physical abuse has taken place are being investigated by Amnesty International as an increasing number of protesters come forward. </p> <p>A spokesman for the British embassy in Prague said no complaints from Britons had been received. \"Stories of Czech brutality or abuse are highly implausible, but if we get any official complaints we'll pass them on to the ministry of foreign affairs,\" he said. </p> <p>Between 850 and 1,000 people were arrested during and after demonstrations which coincided with the annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF last Tuesday and attracted between 12,000 and 15,000 activists from around the world. </p> <p>Legal observers say that \"a few hundred\" are still in custody and that the whereabouts of many are unknown, though a number have probably gone quietly home. </p> <p>Groups of protesters have been campaigning this week at Czech embassies around Europe, including Britain, Italy, Norway and Poland, against the alleged police brutality. </p> <p>Around 500 foreigners are believed to have been arrested, including a large number of Germans and Spanish. </p> <p>According to police, 25 people have been charged, including six Czechs. All 34 Britons arrested are believed to have been released. A 21-year-old university student from London told the Guardian he was picked up at a pub by police on the evening after the September 26 demonstration outside a meeting of international financiers. </p> <p>His hands were bound with plastic so tight, he said, that his wrists swelled. He was strip-searched, his fingerprints and photograph were taken and he was then kept in a four metre by four metre cell with 35 other people. </p> <p>Anyone who tried to sleep was woken up by bright lights and an officer running a stick along the cell bars. People were strip-searched in front of him and slapped when naked. </p> <p>\"I got off fairly lightly in comparison to the Italians and Israelis who they pointed at and beat up in a very fascistic way,\" he added. </p> <p>\"When they took 25 of us to the third destination we had to run towards the bus through two lines of police who hit us in the kidneys with their truncheons and fists. There were women as well, and they laughed as they hit us. Afterwards there were several bleeding noses.\" </p> <p>Like other detainees, the student said he was denied access to a translator most of the time, forced to sign Czech documents he did not understand and deprived of sleep and food. </p> <p>According to OPH - a group whose members, including several lawyers, monitored the observance of justice during the protests - two Norwegian tourists who went to a police station in the north of Prague to report a stolen mobile phone, saw \"a number of people handcuffed to the wall who were being beaten severely\". </p> <p>Other reports claim that arrested women were asked to strip and perform physical exercises in front of male officers. </p> <p>A British woman in her 20s, who suffers from epilepsy, was reportedly forced to mime her condition to prison officers and was then hit for refusing to take the medicine made available to her. </p> <p>Both legal observers and Inpeg, the organiser of the main demonstration, say that medical reports confirm the physical abuse. </p> <p>While the Czech police were widely praised for their handling of the street violence, most of those arrested appear to have been picked up on the streets long after the demonstration and had no direct connection with the violence launched by a few hundred hardcore anarchists. </p> <p>Legal observers and Inpeg say they are hiring lawyers to fight cases of alleged maltreatment. OPH also plans criminal complaints against the Czech police who have so far barely commented on the allegations. </p> <p>\"This is not some strange country like the Ukraine, and we have no information on anyone being badly treated,\" said a spokeswoman for the Prague division of Czech police. \"It's nonsense, but if anyone feels they have been badly treated they can go to the department of complaints and control.\"</p>",
  "A truce between Israel and the Palestinians survived barely half a day yesterday before dying in the roar of automatic fire and rockets from helicopter gunships. <p>The rupturing of the truce, agreed by Israeli and Palestinian security officials overnight, undermines the hope that a US-sponsored meeting between the leaders of the two peoples in Paris today can stem the bloodshed. </p> <p>The first shots yesterday were fired during the funeral procession of a Palestinian teenager in the West Bank city of Nablus. Gunmen in the crowd of 3,000 mourners opened fire on an isolated Israeli army post guarding a Jewish pilgrimage site. </p> <p>Within an hour Israeli soldiers firing sub-machineguns in the Gaza Strip had shot the face off a Palestinian in a group advancing on an outpost at Netzarim junction. About a dozen rockets were fired from the gunships overhead. </p> <p>Netzarim is infamous as the site of the bloodiest clashes in the past six days, the setting of the horrifying death of a 12-year-old boy broadcast around the world at the weekend. </p> <p>Yesterday the Israeli army admitted that snipers firing from the fortified post had killed Mohammed al-Direh. It said the boy, shot four times as he cowered in his father's arms, had been mistaken for a gunmen. </p> <p>By nightfall last night the death toll from six days of violence stood at 55: 43 Palestinians, nine Arab Israelis, an Israeli border policeman, an Israeli soldier and an Israeli Jewish civilian. \"Our estimate is that the climax of this thing lies before us, and his wave of violence will continue,\" the Israeli deputy army chief, Major- General Moshe Yaalon, said. </p> <p>The prospect of ending the violence was not improved last night by reports that the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, would not agree to a direct meeting in Paris with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, in protest at the Israeli troops' excessive use of force. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, remained optimistic. \"We are going to defuse this,\" she told reporters. </p> <p>Tomorrow there will be a further attempt at mediation by the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, at Sharm el-Shaikh on the Sinai peninsula. Both Mr Barak and Mr Arafat are expected to attend those talks. </p> <p>But the collapse of the third ceasefire since the violence began has increased the fear that it may have grown beyond Mr Arafat's powers to control. </p> <p>The sheer fury of the rioters, and their willingness to court death, has come as a shock to Palestinian officials.</p>",
  "For the first time in nearly two decades there is a chance of an end to the war in southern Sudan which has taken half the country out of the control of Khartoum, and plunged its people back more than half a century into isolation and backwardness. <p>\"I went six years without tasting salt, we used tree bark for washing - this was our life,\" says Bishop Reuben, one of the few senior church figures to have stayed in the small town of Yirol rather than heading for the comfort of Nairobi, or even, as some have, to Khartoum.</p> <p>Today Sudan's new international prominence, with a likely seat on the United Nations security council as the candidate of the Organisation of African Unity, its immense new oil riches, combined with major shifts in internal and regional politics, may have created an international impetus to end the long conflict.</p> <p>Two million people have died; twice as many displaced internally; hundreds of thousands live as refugees in the shanty towns of the north or in exile and southern culture and society have been fractured by guns and warlords.</p> <p>But in the last year clan elders, church leaders, and a number of former commanders in the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) have started something new in places like Yirol - organising peasants for what they call New Sudan.</p> <p>Sudan is the biggest country in Africa. Since independence from Britain in 1956 there has been continuous war between the Arab north and the marginalised African south, except for one decade from 1972. The imposition by Khartoum of Islamic sharia law in 1983 unleashed a far more serious war which has spread from the south to the eastern front, the Nuba mountains, and is increasingly concentrated around the oilfields in the centre.</p> <p>Last week, in an unprecedented gesture, President Omar el Bashir travelled to the Eritrean capital, Asmara, to meet leaders of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which links the southern SPLA with opposition groups from the north in a military alliance which has inflicted major defeats on Khartoum.</p> <p>This was just one of a number of diplomatic meetings, with others in Uganda and Kenya at the same time. Egypt has become a key player.</p> <p>For several months Washington has been canvassing a Dayton-type scenario for Sudan with all the myriad opposition groups forced together to hammer out a settlement under international auspices.</p> <p>And Washington has begun to disburse $3m to civic projects in southern Sudan, such as a judicial system, which will soon trickle through to towns like Yirol.</p> <p><b> Bomb shelters</b><br> </p> <p> The SPLA has taken control of almost this entire region, mainly of Dinka cattle-rearers, in the last three years. Earlier, control swung back and forth between rebels and government. Across the south the government controls only garrison towns supplied mainly from the north by air, though some traders cross between control areas.</p> <p>The only contact most southerners have with the government is the periodic bombing of church compounds, hospitals, airstrips, markets and boreholes, in retribution for SPLA military gains. In two weeks of August more than 100 bombs were dropped. Every church compound has a bomb shelter.</p> <p>The UN's Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) has a 10-year-old programme with the government to fly in humanitarian supplies to designated sites in the south agreed by Khartoum. But, increasingly, aid agencies such as Christian Aid, Concern, and Norwegian People's Aid are flying in defiance of Khartoum, sending small civilian supply planes from northern Kenya to a dozen or more airstrips cut through the long grass. They are helping some 5m people in SPLA areas.</p> <p>Food, cement, even a generator, were on our plane, chartered by a church group and flown by a Russian former MiG pilot.</p> <p>Roads in the liberated areas are few and in terrible condition. A 100-mile drive took us eight hour. Many bridges and ferries have been destroyed and only canoes cross the wide tributaries of the Nile which criss-cross the area. The traders, who now bring salt, sugar, tea and cloth to Yirol's market, walk for a month to Uganda for supplies.</p> <p>But Yirol is a symbol of the extraordinary resilience which has kept the society from disintegrating under the squeeze of isolation. The old ways live on and an enthusiastic crowd soon gathers around a wild group of young men who have come into town from the huge cattle camp outside.</p> <p>Bunched tightly together by older men in skins and carrying spears, they perform a ceremonial dance to insistent drumming. They are celebrating the end of an initiation ceremony in which they have spent three months playing together, being fattened on milk, and looked after by a young girl who is then carried in on the shoulders of a group of men. This custom was officially banned by the SPLA last year, but some groups continue the tradition.</p> <p>\"If any of our old practices deserves to be banned it is this one - the most productive group sits idle for three months before becoming a man - this is just not sustainable given how people are living now with the war,\" said one former SPLA commander.</p> <p>He, and several others in the town, are dragging their people into the modern world and the New Sudan through a new organisation called the Bahr el Ghazal Development Association (BYDA).</p> <p>\"Look what happened in Somalia when they got rid of Siad Barre [the president], but hadn't prepared the society for a new situation - a decade without government. We cannot afford to wait for peace and then build a new society, we have to start now,\" said one senior ex-commander, Mario Muor Muor.</p> <p><b> End of isolation</b><br> </p> <p> BYDA has introduced ox-ploughing and micro-credit - staples of modest rural development elsewhere but in this context as revolutionary as the microchip.</p> <p>It took six months of discussion before the SPLA allowed BYDA to operate, accepting it as a partner, not a rival. The organisation, with its many ex-SPLA commanders, is a product of dissent within the south's historic movement.</p> <p>The SPLA's unchallenged leader, John Garang, has been fighting for the south since the mid-1950s. But in the last 17 years of war the SPLA has been split by betrayals and factionalism. It has lived by a military culture imbued in years of training in Ethiopia which gave the movement military strength at the price of a culture of silence, according to Mr Muor. Despite a major conference in 1994 in which resolutions were passed to involve and empower the people they were fighting for, change never came within the SPLA.</p> <p>However, in the last year, the New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC) succeeded in organising a series of peace meetings which has ended muchof the south/south fighting which has been a constant strand of the north/south war.</p> <p>Mr Muor was part of the coalition that put together the first historic meeting at Wunlit, in March 1999. Three hundred youths were mobilised to build a road and airstrip. Elders, clan leaders and commanders were brought together by the NSCC and committed themselves to end the periodic fighting between the Dinka and Nuer tribes and the shifting alliances with the government against the SPLA.</p>",
  "Ann Widdecombe will today unveil new hardline Conservative policies against the recreational use of soft drugs when she announces a \u00a3100 automatic fixed penalty for possession of cannabis. <p>The Tory leadership remains as hostile as Labour to calls for cannabis to be decriminalised and today's creation of the equivalent of a parking ticket - paid without a court appearance - is not intended to signal a softer line. </p> <p>Some 90,000 people a year are fined for possession of cannabis and many more are cautioned in those police authorities where a less severe view is taken. Under Tory plans the caution option would be closed. </p> <p>In her speech to the party conference in Bournemouth the shadow home secretary - currently darling of the Tory activists - will underline the traditional view by urging substantially higher penalties for anyone caught in possession of larger amounts that may be used for dealing purposes. </p> <p>Under a Hague government the police would also gain further powers to raid crack houses. Only last week Tony Blair told his conference that he wants the police to be able to \"do more damage\" to the illegal drugs industry than it does to society at large. </p> <p>As part of her law and order package Miss Widdecombe will also back calls for a new penalty of driving under the influence of drugs, closing an anomaly which allows drunken drivers to be heavily penalised but drug-users to escape. </p> <p>She has already called for \"cops in shops\" this week, a scheme requiring policemen and women to write up their reports in public places. Miss Widdecombe also wishes to introduce a scheme allowing 16-year-olds to become part-time police cadets used on duty by adult police. She believes this would encourage full recruitment at 18 and might discourage anti-police attitudes.</p>",
  "The Conservatives will scrap ballots to abolish grammar schools and revive subsidised places for poorer students in the independent sector, the shadow education secretary, Theresa May, pledged yesterday. <p>In a new version of the assisted places programme, money spent on a bright secondary pupil from a poorer background in the state sector could be transferred to help fund their private school place. Unlike the old scheme, phased out by Labour, the school would make up the shortfall. </p> <p>Under the Tories' \"free schools\" plan, which strips powers from local authorities and allows headteachers and governors to set their own admissions policy, the party can no longer promise a grammar school in every town. </p> <p>But Mrs May told the conference she was \"confident that yes, there will be more grammar schools\". Later she said she supported a \"mixed economy\" of selective and non-selective education. </p> <p>Only one ballot on selection, in Ripon, North Yorkshire, has been held, which was won decisively by supporters of grammar schools. Anti-selection campaigners have complained that rules of the polls have made it all but impossible to get them off the ground. </p> <p>Mrs May promised to give heads and governors complete autonomy to expel pupils, denying parents the right of appeal to local authorities. </p> <p>\"Teachers are more vulnerable than any other group of professionals to false allegations of abuse from children,\" she said. The law would be changed to give teachers media anonymity when they were accused of abuse, until charges were brought. </p> <p>In higher education, Mrs May repeated the promise to \"progressively endow\" universities, giving them lump sums from the sale of government assets such as the radio spectrum. They could use the interest to ensure financial freedom. </p> <p>She attacked the chancellor for his explosive intervention in the debate on university admissions. \"In one speech [Gordon Brown] has done more to discourage state school pupils from aspiring to go to our leading universities than anyone else.\"</p>",
  "Nearly a third of frozen chickens on sale in Britain contain more than the EU limit on added water, the food standards agency said yesterday. <p>It also reported \"completely unacceptable\" water levels in chicken portions during checks conducted by government officials nine months ago. </p> <p>They found offenders among both home-produced meat and imports, where previously frozen products sold as fresh contained as much as 37% added water. </p> <p>Suzi Leather, the agency's deputy chairman, said: \"The bottom line is that in too many cases, consumers are paying for water when they should be paying for chicken... </p> <p>\"The main problem is that the legislation in this field appears to be incomplete and inconsistent.\" </p> <p>She added: \"We will be pushing for changes in EU procedures as a matter of urgency.\" </p> <p>Frozen chicken is allowed to contain up to 7% water depending on the method used for freezing, but 30% of those bought from supermarkets, cash and carries, butchers and other outlets, exceeded this limit. </p> <p>Samples from Britain's largest producer, Grampian County Food Group, recorded readings as high as 16% extra water. </p> <p>Several imports from France, including some on sale in Sainsbury's, also greatly exceeded permitted levels. </p> <p>Out of 1,000 chicken parts analysed, 17% had added water content of between 2% and 17%. Producers represented by the British Poultry Meat Federation pointed out that the agency had only used one of the two available tests for frozen chicken, and there was a discrepancy with results from checks made by manufacturers. </p> <p>Frozen chicken accounts for less than 10% of chicken consumed in the UK, while fresh whole chicken and portions account for another 40%. Most of the remainder is contained in prepared meals.</p>",
  "Two best friends murdered three women and raped seven others in a terrifying four-year campaign, \"hunting\" for victims late at night while listening to the Michael Jackson album Thriller to psych themselves up, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. <p>Wearing balaclavas and bound by a \"unique\" and twisted friendship, David Mulcahy and John Duffy fed each other's \"excitement and anticipation\", becoming more aggressive with each successive attack. </p> <p>Their victims were gagged, blindfolded, threatened at knifepoint and subjected to harrowing sexual abuse, said Mark Dennis, prosecuting. </p> <p>\"Seven involved prolonged and multiple rape and the remaining five were only saved from a similar fate by the attackers breaking off and fleeing. Sometimes they were left naked and told to give their attackers their names and addresses, a clear attempt to frighten them.\" </p> <p>Mulcahy, however, was not satisfied. As time passed, \"his hunger for excitement needed to be fed with a higher level of cruelty and violence,\" Mr Dennis told the jury. He wanted to dominate women completely. </p> <p>Alison Day, 19, Maartje Tamboezer, 15, and Anne Lock, 29, were murdered between December 1985 and May 1986. They were raped before being strangled or suffocated with their own clothes. Miss Tamboezer, the daughter of a Dutch businessman, had only been in the country a year. </p> <p>Duffy was convicted in 1988 of two of the murders, five rapes and a serious sexual assault and sentenced to a minimum of 30 years in prison, the court was told. </p> <p>Mulcahy, 41, a builder, from Chalk Farm, north London, was arrested at the time but not charged. He denied any involvement in the cases. </p> <p>But in late 1997, after a series of counselling sessions, Duffy confessed to 17 other crimes and implicated Mulcahy, Mr Dennis said. </p> <p>\"Ten years into his sentence and aged nearly 40, John Duffy finally decided to come to terms with his past. He was able to start a process of cleansing his conscience and setting the record straight,\" said Mr Dennis. </p> <p>\"He is prepared to name [Mulcahy] as his partner and describe his part in the murders. He is prepared to come before the court and give evidence.\" </p> <p>With Duffy's admissions Mulcahy, a married father of three, was charged with murdering Miss Day, Miss Tamboezer and Anne Lock. He also faces seven other charges of rape and five of conspiracy to rape between October 1982 and May 1986. He has denied all the offences. </p> <p>Mulcahy and Duffy met at secondary school when they were 11, the court heard. They were both bullied and this shared experience bonded them in a \"unique and wicked\" way. </p> <p>After leaving school Mulcahy, who worked part-time as a minicab driver, told a colleague he liked to have \"complete power over women,\" Mr Dennis said. \"He said his wife was completely submissive to him and did everything he told her to do.\" </p> <p>Mulcahy and Duffy talked about raping women when they were teenagers, and soon began plotting their first attack. </p> <p>Driving around in a car, they struck on October 24, 1982, the court heard. They spotted a 21-year-old woman who was walking home along Kilburn High Road, in north London, clutching a teddy bear. </p> <p>She saw two men jogging towards her, Mr Dennis said. They grabbed her and dragged her into a side street, saying they only wanted her toy. </p> <p>When she struggled, one of them threatened her with a knife. She was stripped and they took it in turns to rape her as the other kept look out, it was alleged. </p> <p>\"They had been thrilled by what had happened. They spoke about what they had done and agreed it was easy, exciting and they would do it again,\" Mr Dennis told the court. \"They called it going out hunting.\" </p> <p>Before their next attack, they stole a tape of Michael Jackson's Thriller album, the court heard. \"The tape was to become a part of their kit. It seemed to motivate them as they were driving,\" said Mr Dennis. </p> <p>\"Both seemed able to dissociate themselves from the awful reality of what they were doing and treated their victims only as objects rather than people.\" </p> <p>Over the next three years the men carried out a series of attacks in London, it was alleged. Mulcahy was more aggressive with victims because he found it hard to get aroused, the court heard. </p> <p>He allegedly told one woman he would \"gouge out her eyes and slice off her ears and nipples\" if she failed to excite him with oral sex. </p> <p>Their victims included au pairs from France, Denmark and Germany, a solicitor's clerk, and a social worker, the court heard. </p> <p>Duffy, though, was becoming concerned about his partner's behaviour, Mr Dennis said. He aborted an attack on their ninth victim on Hampstead Heath, north London, fearing Mulcahy had more than rape on his mind. </p> <p>\"It seemed to Duffy that the defendant was displaying a different sort of aggression,\" said Mr Dennis. </p> <p>Duffy intervened in another attack in Hampstead, the court heard, because \"he had never seen a victim react in such a terrified way\". </p> <p>Mr Dennis said: \"It was only a comparatively small step to the ultimate exercise of power - killing victims.\" </p> <p>Miss Day, from Romford, Essex, was the first to die. The men attacked her as she got off a train at Hackney Wick, east London, on December 29, 1985. She was on her way to see her fiance, the court heard. </p> <p>She was forced to walk to the River Lee where they took it in turns to rape her, Mr Dennis said. </p> <p>After falling in the water, Miss Day tried to escape, but was caught. \"Mulcahy was enraged,\" said Mr Dennis. \"He tried to rape her once again. He led her across a playing field, took out a knife and cut up her blouse and put a tourniquet round her neck. He twisted the loop tight as she knelt before him on the ground.\" </p> <p>Her body was found by police divers at the bottom of the river, weighed down by stones. </p> <p>Mulcahy and Duffy ventured to Horsley, Surrey for the next attack on April 17, 1986, the court heard, grabbing Miss Tamboezer as she cycled home. </p> <p>Duffy said a fishing line was tied across the path to trip her up. The teenager was hit across the face, bundled into a muddy field and raped by Duffy, the court heard. </p> <p>Mulcahy then struck her across the head with a heavy stone, it was alleged. Mr Dennis said Mulcahy tied the girl's belt around her neck and told Duffy: \"I did the other one. It's your turn to do this one.\" </p> <p>Duffy twisted a piece of wood with the belt and killed the girl, the court heard. When police found her body, it was badly burned. </p> <p>The last victim, Miss Lock, a secretary, had just returned from honeymooning in the Seychelles. She was attacked on May 18, 1986, at Brookmans Park station in Hertfordshire as she returned home from work. </p> <p>\"She was seized, led down the railway tracks to a field where she was raped and murdered,\" said Mr Dennis. </p> <p>Her badly decomposed body was found two months later in undergrowth. </p> <p>One of her socks was inside her mouth and the other had been tied round her jaw. Death was caused by suffocation. An attempt was made to burn her. </p> <p>\"Duffy was acquitted of this murder. He has now admitted his involvement in this offence and last year admitted her rape,\" said Mr Dennis. </p> <p>He added: \"[Duffy] has come clean and put the record straight. It is now time for this defendant [Mulcahy] to face up to his past, a past which has caught up with him.\" </p> <p>The trial continues today. </p> <p><b>Background</b></p> <p>David Mulcahy was strong, outgoing, something of a show-off and always wanted to be the centre of attention, the court heard. By contrast John Duffy was small, quiet and introverted. </p> <p>The two, who were best friends from the age of 11, were drawn together by their differences and bonded by a desire to \"dominate and exploit\" women, the Old Bailey heard. </p> <p>Both had been singled out for bullying at Haverstock Hill secondary school in Hampstead. </p> <p>Through this experience, they became inseparable, truanting together and abandoning studies to go to work at the age of 16. </p> <p>At that stage they showed little interest in girls, the court heard, but were obsessed by martial arts and watched kung fu films. </p> <p>In their late teens they began fantasising about abusing women, Duffy later told police. </p> <p>They also enjoyed frightening people. A favourite prank was to surprise courting couples and homosexuals on Hampstead Heath, the court heard. </p> <p>\"They would jump out at them wearing Halloween masks,\" said Mark Dennis, prosecuting. \"This behaviour may have been understandable from teenagers, but they were in their 20s.\" </p> <p>Being married and having children did not affect their friendship. </p> <p>They lived close to each other in north London, both worked for Westminster city council, and continued to see each other constantly, the jury was told. </p> <p>When they raped their first victim, the original plan was for one of them to hold her while the other got the car. </p> <p>But neither of the men wanted to be alone with her, the court heard, so they took turns to rape her. In subsequent attacks they often they flipped a coin to see who would go first. </p> <p>\"Each supported the other, knowing what had to be done. Each had complete confidence in the other. There was a unique but wicked bond that existed between them and sustained them,\" Mr Dennis said.</p>",
  "The devious tactics employed by advertising agencies on behalf of the tobacco industry, in their attempts to expand the cigarette market and undermine government anti-smoking policy, are revealed in a new report published today. <p>The report is an analysis of thousands of documents from the five main advertising agencies used by the tobacco industry in the UK, which were released after sessions of the House of Commons health committee which investigated cigarette promotion this year. It is published by the Cancer Research Campaign and the British Medical Association. </p> <p>The report provides evidence that the tobacco manufacturers have not given up the battle to expand their markets, in spite of fierce opposition. One of the internal documents reveals the tactics that were considered at the time that Tessa Jowell, then minister of public health, was pushing ahead with the tobacco advertising ban which has still not become law because of challenges by the industry in the courts. </p> <p>The document, from an advertising agency brainstorming session, suggests they should \"undermine Ms Jowell, (and) position her as the Minister of Bans, undemocratic and rash/hasty decisions\" and \"undermine other supporters, eg Branson (cite connections with Rizla/Virgin)\". </p> <p>The papers belie industry claims that it is not trying to recruit smokers, but compete for market share. \"Ultra has yet to demonstrate a consistent ability to attract new smokers,\" says a memo. </p> <p>They reveal that imagery emphasising \"street cred\" is used to woo young smokers. The agencies make it plain that formula one motor racing - whose exemption from the planned advertising and sponsorship ban became controversial after revelations that its boss Bernie Ecclestone was a major donor to the Labour party - was a useful source of seductive imagery. </p> <p>\"... It lent associations to the brand [Benson and Hedges] with young, racy, adult, exciting, aspirational environments,\" says another document. </p> <p>Other documents analysed by Gerard Hastings and Lynn MacFadyen of the CRC's Centre for Tobacco Control Research at Strathclyde University show that the agencies were willing to condone cigarette smuggling if it helped to establish a new brand. Discounts and gifts were used to target the poor, the report says, while brands such as Marlboro targeted students. </p> <p>The authors argue that the documents prove that voluntary controls on tobacco advertising are useless. Gordon McVie, director general of the CRC, said: \"These companies stop at nothing to ensnare, keep and recruit new smokers.\"</p>",
  "Your leader on the Human Rights Act (October 2) highlighted the paradoxical nature of citizenship by reminding us that \"in this realm we are still subjects not citizens\". What will it take to make me a citizen? I would have thought that a relatively modest piece of legislation could effect this change; but I fear that I would be told that it could only be the final stage in a complicated constitutional upheaval involving the monarchy, and therefore not worth attempting.

  "It is no new thing for political leaders to feel the hot breath of their predecessors on their apprentice necks. The Liberal leader the Marquis of Hartington, invited in 1880 to form a government by the Queen, said he could not possibly do so when such a great man as Gladstone was still around. Anthony Eden took office with Churchill murmuring in the background that he feared the young man (he was 57) might not be up it (and he wasn't). Even Margaret Thatcher had little local difficulties from time to time with Harold Macmillan. But few can have suffered the burden of William Hague, who now that old leaders live longer and new ones take office younger, has no fewer than three of his forerunners, all vigorous and voluble, hanging around. How he must wish he could find them pleasant sinecure posts to while away their retirements in faraway colonies with lousy communications. <p>John Major, who was airbrushed out of last year's proceedings, is this year being airbrushed back in, so his invocation of the party's One Nation traditions came in what newspapers call a coded message: that is to say, he spoke in ways which every politician and journalist could at once see to be chiding, while others could have it explained later. Edward Heath, who gave up coding years ago, was brutal and derisive - though at least he launched his assault from a studio in London, not Bournemouth. </p> <p>And who, in the midst of this aggro, curbed her tongue, sitting silently through the defence debate in the company of Sir Denis and that epitome of Victorian values, Jim Davidson, acknowledging standing ovations with a gracious wave, not with an outburst? Why, that former conference termagant, Baroness Thatcher! Could it be that she's mellowed? Probably not. More likely, her scorn for both Heath and Major has driven her to conclude that embarrassing one's successors in conference week is not the way that decent people behave.</p>",
  "Back in November, when Labour was worried that its poll lead had dropped to a mere 10%, the chairman of the Countryside Alliance, John Jackson, wrote to the home secretary, Jack Straw. It started with a complaint about \"an imminent announcement on fox-hunting\". But it ended with a warning: \"I must tell you,\" wrote Jackson,\"that the rural temperature is very high and the political landscape in the countryside is tinder dry.\" <p>Straw \"noted\" concerns, assured Jackson that media reports had been \"entirely speculative\" and promised to \"bear the matters raised in mind\". His response was prompt, polite and essentially dismissive. </p> <p>It would be easy for the Labour leadership to dismiss the Alliance. This is an organisation with a predominantly Tory membership whose central aim has been to preserve the right to kill foxes and which readily compares Tony Blair to Adolf Hitler. One poster which bore its logo depicted the gay agriculture minister, Nick Brown, as a man \"who loves gays and buggers the countryside\". The logo also appeared in the magazine Earth Dog, Running Dog - from which the Alliance distanced itself. The publication described the black MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, Oona King, as \"typical of her species\", and told her to \"direct her talents to advising her scrounging supporters on how to claim more handouts\". </p> <p>To dismiss the Alliance would be a mistake. It may look like the provisional wing of the landed gentry, but since it started broadening its political horizons it has also broadened its base of support. Today, in Bournemouth, it will take pride of place at the working country fair, a Tory-backed event to show the party's concerns about the plight of rural Britain that will be attended by William Hague. It boasts 80 full-time staff, including 10 regional press and public relations officers, 90,000 individual members at \u00a335 a time, and 300,000 affliated members. All this is maintained with an annual budget of \u00a34.5m, from a range of very wealthy members. \"You can easily raise a few thousand pounds at a hunt meeting. There's a lot of money swilling around,\" says one former Alliance employee who did not wish to be named. </p> <p>Politically it has now become the most vocal and visible opponent of a weakened government. \"They have the potential to be a very potent, electoral force,\" says Michael Jacobs, the general secretary of the Labour-supporting Fabian Society. \"At the moment they have the capacity to mobilise opinion against Labour.\" </p> <p>Last week, nine months after Jackson wrote to Straw, on an overcast autumn day in Brighton and an altogether radically different political climate, the Countryside Alliance marched on the Labour party conference with a spring in its step. </p> <p>To the backing of whistles and hunting horns one member carried a placard stating: \"I love the countryside, I fear my government.\" One was dressed as Tony Blair with a noose around his neck. Numbering more than a thousand they strode purposefully in smart sweaters and pressed jeans, angry yet orderly, between metal railings and a considerable police presence, as Labour delegates in suits looked on bemused, as though viewing exhibits in a zoo. </p> <p>The day before, deputy prime minister, John Prescott, had rallied the conference with a blistering attack on the party's rural opponents. \"Every time I see the Countryside Alliance and their contorted faces, I redouble my determination to vote in the House of Commons to abolish fox-hunting for ever,\" he raged. Now the hunters and their allies are coming in for the kill. </p> <p>It is a stunning revival for an organisation which began life as a hybrid of three minority-interest groups - the British Field Sports Society, the Countryside Movement and the Countryside Business Group. The Countryside Movement was set up in 1995, with the former Liberal leader Sir David Steel as its executive chairman. \"The aim was that it would be a campaigning organisation rather than a membership organisation, that dealt with issues affecting the countryside in general,\" says Alex Armstrong, deputy chief executive of the Alliance who used to work for the Movement. \"But it was not terribly successful.\" </p> <p>Despite several wealthy backers the Movement, which was pro-hunting and received donations from the gun lobby, heavily outspent its budget and had to be rescued with \u00a31m from the Duke of Westminster. </p> <p>The Countryside Business Group was set up by the American financier, Eric Bettelheim, to raise funds to support the hunting lobby. Both were new organisations set up in response to, or anticipation of, a Labour government with a manifesto commitment to ban hunting. Neither had a particularly large following or could claim any great successes other than their ability to raise funds. </p> <p>The linchpin to the Alliance's creation and continued political presence is the now-defunct British Field Sports Society - an organisation dedicated to defending the right to hunt which bequeathed its offices to the Alliance. \"Two limping organisations were swallowed up by the BFSS,\" says a former Alliance employee . \"It was effectively a takeover. The idea was to wrap up hunting in the warm glow of the countryside and everyone will love it.\" </p> <p>What followed was a skilful exercise in rebranding which coincided with a dramatic slump in the fortunes of rural Britain. Sheep were being auctioned for seven pence each; farmers were selling pigs for a \u00a320 loss; hens couldn't be given away, suicides rose. These problems may or may not have been caused by the government, but it was to the government they looked to put things right. \"Rural people feel they have been victimised,\" says Nigel Henson, director of communications for the Alliance. \"They feel that urban Britain couldn't give a monkey's about them.\" </p> <p>The Alliance, with its recent makeover, was perfectly poised to step into the void and bring together the disparate discontent in the countryside. </p> <p>Initially it fared poorly. Its first national demonstration in London in 1998 was large but undermined by a poll which revealed that 80% of the demonstrators were Conservatives, leaving the government with few concerns about losing votes. No sooner had they arrived in the capital than stories emerged of employers coercing their employees into making the trip. If ever there appeared to be a battle between old and new Britain, between the forces of modernism and the agents of privilege then this was it; the squirearchy on parade waging a class war against a culturally metropolitan and ostensibly liberal Labour government </p> <p>When questioned about rural issues other than hunting, employees would simply make up a position on the spot. \"All we knew about was hunting. It was all we cared about too,\" says one. </p> <p>Then a change of management followed bitter in-fighting. A few months after the march the newly-appointed head of the Alliance, Edward Duke, resigned after all the regional chairmen demanded his removal. \"Our quest to be taken seriously is in tatters,\" said hunting's in-house journal, Horse &amp; Hound. \"We have been torn apart by ambition, power struggles, prejudice and the inability to see the bigger picture.\" </p> <p>Faced by a huge parliamentary majority, supporters took to the streets to make their grievances known. Its shambolic determination recalled the hard left of the 80s. It was riven with internal splits, the leadership was constantly denounced by the membership for selling out the cause, and it attempted to emulate the age-old leftist tactic of entryism. Through an organisation called Friends of the National Trust, Alliance supporters' attempts to infiltrate the upper echelons of the National Trust, which banned stag-hunting on its land, have so far proved unsuccesful. When they demonstrated in London two years ago one passer-by shouted: \"We subsidise you,\" while another asked: \"Why don't you get proper jobs?\" Replace the Barbours with donkey jackets and Labour with the Tories and they are, in many ways, a mirror image of how the hard left behaved and was perceived. </p> <p>This undoubtedly was the calculation Prescott made when he delivered his speech last week, when he treated the Alliance to the same contempt that Margaret Thatcher showed to CND supporters and miners. \"Fox hunters are one of the few enemies the Labour party allow themselves nowadays,\" says Jacobs. </p> <p>However, since its early, disorganised days the Alliance has developed policy on everything from pubs to poverty and abbatoirs to employment. Its chief executive, Richard Burge, is a Labour party member; neither he, his deputy, his chairman or Henson are hunters. The key issues for the countryside, Henson admits, are \"the demise in the economic and retail sectors which are crippling the social infrastructure\". The priority for the Alliance however remains saving the hunt. \"If you looked at our membership you will inevitably find a leaning towards people who joined for country sports reasons,\" says Henson. \"The reason we have concentrated on that recently is that it is immediately under threat. The Labour party is going to ban hunting, they are not going to ban rural post offices.\" </p> <p> Its project of acting as the hegemonic voice of rural Britain is by no means assured. \"We are a new organisation in a period of transition,\" says Henson. The failure of the Alliance to back the fuel protests, on the grounds that it would alienate it from public opinion, was received angrily by many in rural areas. \"There are completely contradictory forces involved,\" says Jacob. \"There is no coherent base apart from geographic proximity.\" </p> <p>Some wish it would ditch its support for the hunt in order to broaden its appeal. Others are concerned that it is diluting its central purpose to save its political skin. \"People think they are preparing for life after fox- hunting,\" says a former employee. \"But it won't have a life after fox- hunting. Most of its members joined to save the hunt. When that goes they'll leave.\" In the Daily Telegraph last week, the publisher of Gun Trade News, Simon Baseley, warned: \"Members and others should be rightly suspicious of the Countryside Alliance re-branding. This has given rise to a feeling that the alliance has at some level accepted that the fight for hunting is lost and is beginning to prepare a retreat to a better prepared position.\" </p> <p>None the less they represent a serious problem for Labour. Tory dominance in rural areas is much overstated and the countryside is an ideal battleground for Hague to recoup some of its losses. While hunting, and particularly hunters, remain unpopular with the general public, rural Britain is not. The more sucessful the Countryside Alliance becomes at presenting itself as the voice of impoverished rural Britain, the more sophisticated Labour will have to become about the manner in which it deals with them. To dismiss them will be perceived to be dismissing the countryside. </p> <p>Henson's claim that the Alliance is \"resolutely apolitical\" is laughable, but it remains to be seen just how party political it will be come the election. </p> <p>From the podium Prescott asked why they weren't outside the Tory party conference \"when Tories were shutting 2,000 post offices, selling off 10,000 council houses, ending bus services and closing village schools\". The Alliance replied that they simply did not exist then. \"If we did then of course we would have protested.\" Given the present complexion of its membership, it is doubtful they would have attracted much support for such a protest against a Conservative government. None the less, given the remit it has claimed for itself, it is doubtful it would have got away without organising one. </p> <p>\"We're looking at the seats that are swingable to persuade the candidates to get real about the countryside,\" says Henson, referring to Prescott's speech. \"But if that's the way the Labour party is going to act they are not going to get much support from us.\" </p> <p>Says Michael Jacobs: \"They need to treat the Countryside Alliance with a level of maturity that the Alliance itself arguably does not have.\" That, at least, is a warning Labour would do well not to wait nine months to heed.</p>",

  "The name itself was a magnet for well-to-do New Yorkers taking their ease in their summer playground at the Hamptons, east of the city. And when Christopher Rockefeller offered them a painless way to enhance their financial insulation, it seemed silly not to go along with his scheme. <p>So what if, for some reason, he had a French accent? Yes, it might also have been odd that he had more experience with tattoos than fine wines but, as a Rockefeller, he boasted a family name historically synonymous with New York city wealth, philanthropy and public service. </p> <p>However, Christopher was a different kind of Rockefeller: in fact he was not a Rockefeller at all but a con man and killer, according to police who are hunting the man they know Christopher Rocancourt, 33, from Honfleur, Normandy. </p> <p>He is said to have relieved the Hamptons' elite of nearly $900,000 (\u00a3613,000) before being charged with impersonation and defaulting on a $19,000 (\u00a313,000) hotel bill, on top of previous activities conducted in Beverly Hills, Miami, San Francisco and Hong Kong that made him millions more. </p> <p>Investigators also say he was linked to a diamond smugglers in Zaire, a jewellery robbery in Geneva and the shooting of a drug dealer's bodyguard in California. </p> <p>\"He's a criminal, a fugitive on the run and he needs to go to jail,\" said George Mueller, supervising investigator for the Los Angeles district attorney's office. </p> <p>Resident Tom Gregory, on the other hand, thought Rocancourt had some interesting things to say, even if he was not much good at tennis. </p> <p>They came to a deal whereby Rocancourt would wire a $500,000 (\u00a3341,000) loan to Mr Gregory's account in return for a payment of $50,000 in cash.

  "<p>An Oxford University professor involved in giving South American Indians a measles vaccine in the 1960s has rejected allegations in the US that he and other scientists may have deliberately triggered an epidemic of the disease. </p> <p>Speaking for the first time about his role in the project, Ryk Ward, professor of biological anthropology at Oxford, said he and other scientists saved Indians stricken by a measles outbreak which had begun just before they arrived. </p> <p>The source of the accusations, which have shaken the world of anthropology, is a soon to be published book, Darkness In El Dorado, by the journalist Patrick Tierney. </p> <p>In an email leaked to the Guardian last month, two anthropologists who have read proofs of the book say it shows that the leader of the measles expedition, James Neel, was a callous, manipulative figure, who coldly observed without intervening as hundreds of Indians fell victim to a disease he either started deliberately or, at best, let rage unchecked. </p> <p>Dr Neel, professor of human genetics at the University of Michigan, died in February. Prof Ward is one of the few survivors of his expedition to the Yanomami Indians of Venezuela in 1968, when the measles epidemic hit, yet he says Mr Tierney - who has spent 10 years researching his book - has never been in touch with him. </p> <p>One of the anthropologists who has seen the book, Terry Turner of Cornell University, says that Dr Neel deliberately used an unsafe measles vaccine on the Yanomami, without consulting medical experts or the Venezuelan government, held his team back from giving medical help to the sick and dying, and sought to use the tragedy to back up his \"fascistic\" theories of the survival of the fittest humans. </p> <p>New Zealand-born Prof Ward, who joined Dr Neel's group as a young postgraduate and delivered the vaccine from Guyana to the expedition's jumping off point in Caracas, said all the allegations were demonstrably false. He was less troubled by the book than by the role of Prof Turner and others, who, he claimed, had assumed it was accurate without trying to find out what had really happened. </p> <p>\"These kind of unjustified allegations can only convince the public that scientists are up to no good, that their work is suspect and shouldn't be funded,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Although they don't directly refer to me, I was part of the team, I was directly involved in getting the measles vaccine into Venezuela and I felt then, and still feel now, that the decision to vaccinate was the correct and ethically responsible thing to do.\" </p> <p>According to Prof Ward, 57, the expedition's main purpose was to study the genetic makeup of the Yanomami. But like many of his contemporaries Dr Neel was concerned that the spread of missionaries, loggers and prospectors into the Yanomami territory, around the Orinoco river, could expose them to diseases to which they had no immunity, such as measles. </p> <p>He suggested vaccinating Indians in the villages the team visited, and after consulting with the centre for disease control in Atlanta, the pan-American health organisation and the Venezuelan authorities, arranged for a vaccine called Edmonston B to be used. The Yanomami were not consulted. </p> <p>This vaccine tended to trigger mild measles-like symptoms, but then offered stronger immunity to the disease. It had already been administered to millions around the world. </p> <p>Far from causing the epidemic, said Prof Ward, the expedition's plans had been thrown into disarray when, a week before they left Caracas, they heard the measles epidemic had already begun, in the Indian settlement of Ocamo. </p> <p>The team then spent two to three weeks in about eight villages, vaccinating Indians in the hope of stemming the epidemic. Although none of those who were vaccinated appeared to have caught measles, and no one died of the disease, they were unable to prevent it spreading into more remote communities, and there were many deaths. </p> <p>Prof Ward said it turned out the Yanomami had no more or less resistance to measles than British or American people. So many died because everyone in a village would fall ill at the same time, people - especially the old and very young - would not get enough food and water, and this in turn left them prey to other infections, such as pneumonia. </p> <p>Prof Ward accepted that part of the funding for the expedition came from the US atomic energy commission, which was interested in natural genetic mutations. But he said it was false to connect Dr Neel with other experiments where people were injected with plutonium without their permission. </p> <p>He said Dr Neel was often arrogant and impatient, but it was wrong to characterise him as having a supremacist attitude towards \"primitive\" people such as the Yanomami, who he believed had much to teach the developed world in terms of diet and fitness. </p> <p>A showdown over the book is expected in San Francisco next month, when the American anthropological association holds its annual meeting. </p> <p><strong>Link to article in Guardian, 23 September:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,372067,00.html\">Scentist 'killed Amazon indians to test race theory' </a></p>",
  "John Major has been drafted in by William Hague to lend credibility to a series of \"one nation\" policies unveiled by the Tory leadership in Bournemouth this week. <p>Senior members of the shadow cabinet have been instructed to brief the former prime minister on their announcements to ensure they win support from the man who has cast himself as the champion of the party's one nation wing. </p> <p>The top billing enjoyed by Mr Major contrasts with a low key performance by Margaret Thatcher who hijacked last year's conference when she appeared at a pro-Pinochet rally. </p> <p>During a one day visit to Bournemouth yesterday, Lady Thatcher appeared on the platform - where she received a standing ovation - but made no formal speech. </p> <p>Her only intervention of the day was to round on the government for perpetrating a \"fraud\" on pensioners. The for mer prime minister said: \"This government has put a means test of old age pensions so that thousands and thousands of people who paid contributions all their lives are not getting their pensions. That to me is outright fraud.\" </p> <p>Mr Major had underlined his anger with Mr Hague's lurch to the right when he told a fringe meeting at the Tory conference on Monday that the party had failed to reach out to voters \"outside the circle of rising prosperity\". </p> <p>However, the former prime minister believes that Mr Hague is now making a genuine bid to reach out to voters on the centre ground. The Tory leader launched this week's conference with a pledge to revitalise Britain's inner cities and the leadership promised yesterday to outspend Labour on health, though this will involve a greater role for the private sector. </p> <p>Mr Major has been briefed on all the new policies announced this week, which have met with his approval. \"The shadow cabinet have been consulting me, they have been meticulous and call me regularly,\" Mr Major said. \"I have suggested some policies, but I take no credit for any of it. I repeat I take no credit.\" </p> <p>Some Tories on the left of the party, who were exasperated by Mr Hague's provocative interventions on asylum seekers and law and order, believe that the leadership's conversion to one nation policies is too little too late. Sir Edward Heath spoke up for the critics yesterday when he accused Mr Hague of making up policies \"on the spur of the moment\". Asked whether he agreed with this view, Mr Major indicated some sympathy with the \"wets\" when he said: \"Maybe.\" </p> <p>The new warmth between Mr Major and the Tory leadership marks an important rapprochement after the shadow cabinet attempted at last year's conference to airbrush the former prime minister out of Conservative history. </p> <p>Mr Major, who pointedly went on holiday to Venice during last year's gathering, was deeply hurt. Tory activists demonstrated their affection for Mr Major at his fringe meeting on Monday night, which was packed out.</p>",

  "The first line of one of Mahmud Darwish's best known poems, in which a Palestinian in Israel responds with measured defiance to a demand for his identity card, is: \"Write down, I am an Arab\", and the last \"Beware of my anger\". Israeli Jews have glimpsed that anger among those they call Israeli Arabs before, but they have never seen it quite so clearly as during the last few days. <p>Palestinians within Israel have challenged Israeli forces as boldly as those in the occupied territories, and they have died on the barricades in proportion. As well as those who have gone down to Israeli fire in Gaza and the West Bank, the Israelis have been killing their own citizens in Israel itself. Eight have died during the violence so far. It may well be that this confrontation between the Israelis and their \"own\" Arabs will come to be seen as the most critical result of Ehud Barak's failure to keep his promises of peace. </p> <p>Those promises were made, after all, not only to the 5m Jewish citizens of Israel but to the 1m citizens who are Arabs, 95% of whom voted for Barak because they believed he would not only bring about a peace settlement but also an improvement in their own status and prospects within Israel itself. That they have got neither is why their young men went out on the streets in such numbers. And Palestinians in Israel have as much reason, it should be noted, to abhor Ariel Sharon, the man who set off this most recent disastrous chain of events, as do Palestinians in the territories. It was Sharon who launched, in 1977, an offensive designed in his words \"to stem the hold of foreigners on state lands\", by which he meant the expulsion of Arab citizens of Israel from land around their own villages, which they claimed by customary right, but which Israel chose to designate as government owned. The deliberate choking off of all room for expansion around so many Arab communities, while nearby Jewish ones got lavish grants, is a source of grievance second only to the original seizures of 1948. </p> <p> S tifled in their rural base and limited in their access to education and jobs, Palestinians in Israel are much worse off than Israelis. The 10 communities in Israel with the highest unemployment are Arab; 60,000 Arab citizens in the Negev live in squatter camps, and 40% of Arab families in Israel are below the poverty line. Nevertheless they are better off than their cousins in the ter ritories: they have some political influence, and significant rights as individuals, thanks in part to the sincere efforts of Israeli Jewish liberals. A long honed system of Israeli control, dividing them from one another physically by judiciously establishing tracts of Jewish territory, politically by encouraging rivalrous forms of local govern- ment, and socially by co- opting the most intelligent and enterprising, has kept them largely passive in the past. Their contacts with Palestinians in the territories have been surprisingly sparse. But all this has been changing. </p> <p>In May this year Arik Ron, the police commander of the northern region, spoke of a surge of nationalism among Arab citizens. The newspaper Ha'aretz deplored the prejudice and obstacles with which they had to contend, but warned \"Now the Israeli Arab demand has taken on a new cast, one that is more assertive and ultra- nationalistic and also periodically violent... Arab citizens of Israel can wage a legitimate campaign to attain rights that are genuinely due to them, or they can stage a secessionist struggle - one that the state of Israel cannot countenance.\" </p> <p>This is the nightmare before Barak at this moment: as much as it is desperately necessary to back away from violence with the Palestinians in the territories, it is even more important to rescue the situation at home, where there is no buffer between Jews and Arabs and no solution if Arab alienation goes too far. No wonder Barak is calling in the Arab mayors and offering to tour the Arab regions of the north. </p> <p>What Ha'aretz sees as secessionist, some Palestinian leaders and intellectuals see as no more than an attempt to claim collective as well as individual rights. Others, like the communists, would agree insofar as they want any protest anchored in both the Jewish and Arab communities. But all would agree that successive Israeli governments, including this one, have let the situation fester. </p> <p>Barak had already disappointed Palestinians in Israel by his slowness earlier this year, as serious student demonstrations showed. One Palestinian radical saw then \"the first buds of an all- Palestinian awakening from its illusion\" that \"Barak is the Messiah\". Barak gave Palestinians in Israel hope - hope that there would be a passably just settlement in the territories, followed by a change in the relationship between Jews and Arabs in Israel. He did so at a moment when the younger generation may have been hesitating between a more stridently Palestinian identification and a readiness to work within the Israeli polity. Success in bringing peace would have enabled them to transcend this difficulty, to be comfortable with both a Palestinian identity and an Israeli fate. </p> <p>Failure has had the opposite effect. Unless the peace designed for the territories can be rescued, that other peace between the two peoples in Israel itself will continue to be endangered. </p> <p><a href=\"martin.woollacott@guardian. co.uk\">martin.woollacott@guardian. co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>\"Now I'm gonna beat you up.\" The sweet-faced, quietly spoken young black man stops laughing. His dreadlocked partner in music is busy making a cup of Earl Grey. We are in a central London hotel room, the sweet-faced one is reading aloud my notes on their new album, and he has just reached the part where I say he sounds bored. He offers an explanation about \"a lazy style\" for the track in question, System Check, and moves on. </p> <p>\"What is rabble-rousing?\" asks Dynamite, the MC for Mercury music prize-winning drum'n'bass band Reprazent. Having approved of the answer, he carries on reading. \" 'A feeling of portent - fucked-up piano fanfare and hyper-speed beats ...Tense, dense textures.' Hahahaha! 'A seriously spooked chorus of bruised angels floats overhead!' Bruised angels? Yoosh! What a yawn!\" He passes the notes to the maker of the tea - producer and jungle don Roni Size. </p> <p>It is three years since the Bristol collective known as Reprazent made their debut album, New Forms, a record that became a benchmark for the speedy, aggressive, futuristic dance noise formerly known as jungle. When its jazzy, sprawling charms won the 1997 Mercury, Size and crew were hailed as the spearhead for jungle's headlong rush into the mainstream. New Forms was subtle, soulful, dinner-party friendly and promoted by an extraordinary live show. Reprazent and the scene they represented were going to fulfil their destiny and become huge. </p> <p>Then... nothing. Except three years of drum'n'bass thunder being stolen by the wacky student galumphing of big beat, the hedonistic rush of trance and the sensual funk of UK garage. </p> <p>The arrival of the second Reprazent album, the extraordinary In the Mode, is not merely intended to put Size and co back in the public eye but the entire drum'n'bass scene. This is a huge responsibility, and like many a black British artist before him, Size seems obsessed with the scene he comes from and with being seen not to compromise. This self-consciousness seems strange, though, since In the Mode - an uncompromising, muscular, loud, challenging, brilliant record - speaks for itself, possibly to a far greater extent than Size realises. </p> <p>Size talks about the Mercury (\"Fantastic!\"), the pressure of following up (\"Having no opportunity and a giro for \u00a336 a fortnight - that's pressure\") and inspiring others (\"What we generate in Bristol is hope\"). But he becomes more interesting when he hits on that old chestnut of black/dance music, the perils of crossover. \"Mainstream, commercial,\" he says. \"This is the language of the media, and it always triggers people's emotions. If I stay in the underground I won't learn how the machine works. If I go off into the overground, I'll lose touch with what my artists are trying to express.\" </p> <p>Why does he feel that he has to explain all this? \"Even if we made a top-10 commercial record with pop antics tomorrow, we still wouldn't be selling out. We keep true to the form. We wanna do something that is gonna make people laugh and whatever. We wanna tell a joke, dress up in clown suits and jump out of airplanes and make a record where you can just get drunk and sing along and play it at your wedding.\" </p> <p>Do Reprazent think a heavy, macho vibe is part of jungle's problem? Women, after all, appear to have deserted it for garage. </p> <p>\"No, I wouldn't say that at all,\" says Dynamite. \"I'm a bit confused by that statement. You mean, just because drum'n'bass doesn't incorporate a nice piano and a girl going whoo-whoo? If that's what it takes to get people through the door, then there's a lot of producers who'll do that. Garage just came in and filled a gap. The garage thing is cool. You can hear a lot of jungle elements in it and that's fine. </p> <p>\"But jungle is still heading in a direction. People needed garage's little bubblegum sound, and if they want to chew bubblegum, they can. I mean, we've got MJ Cole supporting us on tour because garage needs to be there. I don't listen to a lot of it. I hear a lot of cheesy crap. In our circle we're on to bigger and better things.\" </p> <p>Size expresses surprise at how much radio and MTV exposure the single Who Told You is getting. A relatively innocent comment from me about the track's \"poppiness\" precipitates a change of mood. </p> <p>\"What do you mean, pop?\" Size glares. \"To me, pop is a short word for popular, meaning the majority like the music, rather than what chords are being played. There's pop in the arrangement... maybe.\" </p> <p>An awkward silence descends. So do you expect Who Told You to chart quite high? \"I don't really look at the charts,\" Size deadpans. </p> <p>Nonetheless, the pair are not sullen or superior. They talk about the joy of working with the album's guest stars, Wu-Tang rapper Method Man and Zack De La Rocha of Yank agit-rockers Rage Against the Machine, and Size becomes a different person as he gushes animatedly about making In the Mode and putting together this autumn's live show. </p> <p>You can't help feeling he's more comfortable at expressing the wonders of himself and his mates' working lives than trying to bear the weight of an entire scene whose protagonists, frankly, don't make records as good as his. He tells me his wish list of guest collaborators. \"Quincy Jones. Sade. Lauryn Hill. So many! We wanna do a million artists on one record. No one has done that before!\" </p> <p>The new Reprazent album is astonishing. Go and see them live, because they rock (and pop) and because they transcend the underachieving scene they sprang from.</p> <p>\u0095 Reprazent play the Manchester Academy (0161-275 2930) on Saturday, then tour.

The word that Palestinians repeat again and again is \"frustration\". </p> <p>Over the last few days much of this resentment has been directed against the Israeli security forces, but that is not the whole picture. </p> <p>The trend over the last year has been towards an increase in violence, according to Chris Doyle, of the London-based Council for the Advancement of Arab-British Understanding. Significantly, he says, there has been a growth in unrest directed against the Palestinian authorities, such as the attempt to assassinate the governor of Ramallah last January. </p> <p>Mr Arafat now faces pressure from four directions: from the Palestinians themselves, from the Israelis, from the United States, and from the rest of the Arab and Islamic world. </p> <p>\"The civilian population are totally fed up,\" Dr Mustapha Barghouti, of the Palestinian health organisation, HDIP, said yesterday. Since the troubles broke out last week, there has been a qualitative change, he said. </p> <p>\"The international community must understand that the Oslo track [the basis for the current peace process] is dead. These negotiations have led to deadlock and the parameters are incompatible with reaching a solution.\" </p> <p>He added: \"To be faithful to his people, Arafat has to change the rules of the game. He cannot become a collaborator.\" </p> <p>Calls for the declaration of a Palestinian state may be renewed, though many Palestinians recognise that this could be self-defeating: it would solidify the status quo and make a solution of the Jerusalem issue more difficult. The fashionable talk is of a concerted effort to build a real state from the grassroots. </p> <p>While Mr Arafat is obliged to listen to his people, he is under pressure from the Israelis to control them. \"The Palestinian security forces have every means at their disposal to quell the violence if they want to,\" an Israeli spokesman said yesterday. </p> <p>It's up to Arafat - that is the constant Israeli spin. \"Barak is paying a political price [for the peace process],\" the spokesman said. \"If Arafat is too scared to pay a political price, we're not going to have the story carried forward. </p> <p>\"It's a challenge of leadership, and there's a feeling that Arafat doesn't have the balls.\" </p> <p>Mr Arafat can expect similar pressure from the US when he meets the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, to discuss the violence. Although Bill Clinton's hopes of pushing the two sides into a settlement during his presidency are fading, nobody doubts that in the end it will be mainly the US that bankrolls a peace deal. </p> <p>Mr Arafat also has to consider the expectations of the Arab and Islamic world over Jerusalem. Arabs and Muslims in general claim a stake in the fate of the city, the third holiest site in Islam - a point they have had difficulty impressing upon the Americans. </p> <p>Amid these conflicting demands, Mr Arafat can feel a little more secure than prime minister Ehud Barak, since his position as Palestinian leader is not under threat - though it could be if he made the wrong move. </p> <p>The Palestinian Islamist organisation, Hamas, is not widely regarded as a challenger for power - though it has its strengths. As a reprisal for the recent killings, some expect it to carry out suicide bombings in Israel. </p> <p>While his health permits, Mr Arafat will probably have no need to fend off challengers. If the question of succession did arise, the person designated to take over would be Ahmed Qurei, speaker of the Palestinian legislative council. The Americans, however, are said to favour Mohammed Dahlam, the tough 36-year-old head of security in Gaza.</p>",
  "Pierre Trudeau (Obituary, September 30) identified with, and appealed to, the idealism of the young. President Lyndon Johnson may have wanted a \"great society\" for the United States, but Trudeau called for a \"just society\" in Canada. <p>Trudeau caught and shaped the 60s wave. He articulated the values of a generation that desperately wanted to make a difference, and we never forgot. In Canada today, we are all Trudeau's children. He was not content to merely represent consensus, he intended to mould it. And his style was as great a magnet in attracting the attention of Canadians as the worth of his ideas. He was the perfect post-1967 representative of the Canada we wanted to be - bilingual, cosmopolitan and adventurous. </p> <p>I knew many different Pierre Trudeaus: the intellectual at peace in his study, and the exhibitionist doing a pirouette; the gunslinger taking on all comers in the House of Commons in Ottawa, and a lover of children, making them feel at ease outside his office; the willing recipient of the adulation of thousands, and the loner who never lost his private reserve. He did not manufacture or create a false self. </p> <p>Trudeau knew music, poetry, literature, history, economics, architecture, philosophy and law. He was at his best in a crisis - the FLQ in 1970, the election of the Parti Quebecois in 1976, the 1980 referendum and the 1981 patriation of the constitution - because he had judgment, intelligence, courage and, above all, inner steel. </p> <p>The main outlines of the Trudeau Project are well known: the Charter of Rights, the Official Languages Act, the fight against separatism, a multi-cultural Canada, an activist government, and an independent foreign policy. What is seldom remarked upon, however, is that the foundation of his philosophy was a belief that leaders draw their authority not from office, but as a gift from the people. </p> <p>In 1980, for example, having just been returned to office, a poll showed that the separatists were ahead in the upcoming referendum. The Cabinet Office was duly alarmed and aides and advisers rushed in full of foreboding. One man, however, was calm amidst the turmoil. \"I know Quebecers,\" the prime minister said, \"they will never vote to leave Canada.\" Confidence in the judgment of the people was the starting point of his approach to politics. </p> <p>I first met Trudeau in the autumn of 1966 at the National Liberal convention. He was a newly elected MP, I was a youth delegate from Winnipeg. On the floor of the conference, I argued for the federal government to take a direct role in urban affairs. He dissented vigorously. The debate continued in the hallway. As the doors to the elevator in the Chateau Laurier were about to close, he snapped: \"Look, read the constitution.\" For the next 20 years, I did little else but. </p> <p>Teaching the spirit of the constitution means that the role of the leader - by word, deed and example - is to embody our highest ideals. Leaders should appeal to the better angels of our nature. That is the secret of Trudeau's continuing hold on Canadians. </p> <p>He was our only prime minister to be as influential out of office as during his heyday of power. This was because he always had the largest, most inclusive vision - a tolerant, open, sharing, independent, just society. His vision may have been impractical, but it was never ignoble. </p>",
  "Less flamboyant than his holidays tycoon rival Sir Billy Butlin, Sir Fred Pontin, who has died aged 93, was the more significant judge of social trends. He sensed that the blue-collar holiday camp concept pioneered by Butlin would be overtaken in the postwar years by the more middle-class holiday village; in short, that self-catering would erode the \"Wakey, wakey!\" ambience. <p>The two pioneers were temperamentally at opposite poles. The bluffly moustached showman Butlin was fond of the limelight and any form of celebrity. The clean-shaven and seldom-smiling Pontin, a man of few words, valued his contacts with royalty, and coolly tailored himself to the demands of a more classy type of clientele. He merged a blunt, even pugnacious, management style with work for theatrical and sporting charities, which won him a knighthood in 1976. </p> <p>Perhaps Pontin was only superficially the less pushy of the pair. Butlin once paid a sneaky visit to a Pontins camp to get ideas from his rival, something Pontin would never have done. But he responded with a publicity brochure that included a photograph of Butlin at a Pontins bar, and the caption: \"All the best people come to Pontins.\" </p> <p>Like many self-made multi-millionaires, Sir Fred was fond of emphasising his lack of academic qualifications. His family had been East End cabinet makers for generations, and, after the local council school in Dalston, he attended the Sir George Monoux grammar school, Walthamstow, leaving at 15 without having passed any examinations. </p> <p>His father wanted him to seek security in the local bank, but Fred's fortune-hunting eyes alighted on the stock exchange, and he joined stockbrokers Gordon Askew and Biddough as a jobber for \u00a31 a week, plus commission. A week later, the firm went into voluntary liquidation. However, in addition to two weeks' pay, he also got \u00a3100 in commission, a large sum in those days. A week later, he got a job with a another stockbroker, Gow and Parsons, at 15 shillings (75p) a week. </p> <p>This time, he was sacked for allowing errors in the postal system, but he pleaded his case with such vigour that he was reinstated at 25 shillings a week - and the assurance that his work would not involve such details. He left after three years for the jobbers Bristow Brothers, and, after a year, moved on to the Rock Investments Company, where for 10 years he gained experience of company investment, market dealings and group shares. In 1937, he set up on his own, running a football pool in London. </p> <p>Called up at the beginning of the war, he found himself labelled medical grade 4 (the lowest) because of mastoid trouble, and was sent to Orkney to help 5,000 Irish labourers build a naval base. He soon found himself appointed catering manager, a task he relished. </p> <p>Directed to Kidderminster to manage a hostel for steel and sugar beet workers, he discovered that his predecessor was in hospital, having had his ribs kicked in by workers protesting over food grievances. With a typical blend of blunt ruthlessness and delight in being of service, Pontin got himself a large alsatian guard dog and a bodyguard even bulkier than himself, then set to work improving the conditions. He appears to have succeeded; at any rate, his ribs remained intact. </p> <p>After the war, Pontin decided to use all his painful experience in a more upbeat fashion. Abruptly demobbed servicemen and women found themselves with money - their demob gratuities - perhaps for the first time in their lives. What would they most want? A holiday, surely? Pontin backed his intuition, and set his eyes on a former military camp at Bream Sands, near Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset. It cost \u00a323,000, which Pontin didn't have. But he did have ingenuity: he formed a syndicate for \u00a325,000, ensuring he held 50% control by buying half the equity with a bank loan. </p> <p>This was to be the beginning of a strategy that would make him millions. He bought more camps, personally ran each for a year to lick it into shape, then sold it to the syndicate - in which he still had 50%. The Pontins company was formed in July, 1946, with 400,000 shares, all placed in one day - a feat never accomplished, or even attempted, before. </p> <p>By the 1960s, his British holiday camps and villages were thriving, and he cast his eyes abroad. Though he had managed to enlarge the domestic holiday season from April to October, the British weather prevented him from stretching it further. So, in 1963, he formed Pontinental and built a chain of holiday villages in Spain, Majorca, Sardinia, Ibiza, Greece, Morocco and Yugoslavia. </p> <p> The first was in Sardinia, a double-winged building of three storeys, which became the template for future developments. Each apartment had its own bathroom and tea-making machine and, because British holidaymakers still believed that all foreign food would upset their stomachs, the restaurants served plain English food, augmented by a single Mediterranean dish for bolder spirits. There was a nightclub, relegated to the basement. Foreign governments were at first eager to lend Pontin up to 50% of his building costs, at modest interest rates over 15 to 20 years. Then they realised they might be wasting their charity on lucrative foreign enterprises unpopular with their own electorates, and cut back the financial aid. Pontin lost \u00a3200,000 in two years on his overseas complexes. </p> <p>By then, however, he had seen the potential of the self-catering holiday in smaller housing units in a holiday village. He tried out the first at Wick Ferry village, near Christchurch, with entertainment and restaurants for the occasions when no one wanted to cook for themselves. His first year profit was only \u00a316,000, but by 1975 it had leapt to \u00a33.6m - from 25 villages, 18 with catering, and seven with self-catering, the largest with 5,000 beds. The self-catering idea had proved its worth against those who argued that, when people went on holiday, they wanted to be sociable and abandon cooking for themselves. </p> <p>By now, Pontin's wealth had helped him to acquire a string of racehorses, but, even here, his interest was less exhibitionism than calculated business. His first horse was named Go Pontin, followed by Pontingo and Go Pontinental. His instruction to his trainers and jockeys was that they must always finish in the first three or four - so that the sports commentators would keep on mentioning them - and give their owner free advertising worth millions. One of his horses, Specify, won the Grand National in 1971. </p> <p>Such flirting with the world of the turf might have irritated those who worked for him. But Pontin shrewdly kept on the right side of his employees, especially in the recessions of the 1970s, by voluntarily taking a salary cut of \u00a3928 a week and foregoing substantial sums in commission. This, he said, was because his workers were only getting small wage increases, although later he acknowledged that the money would have gone in tax anyway. </p> <p>Pontin's work for charities also kept him in favour. He had been chief barker of the Variety Club of Great Britain, for which he raised more than \u00a31m, and was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats, two of the biggest theatrical charities. He was also a member of the Lord's Taverners. </p> <p>In 1978, he sold out his main leisure interests to the Coral group. He remained a director, but was not suited to running in harness with the Coral family - or anyone else for that matter - and, after two years, resigned from the board with a \u00a3200,000 pay-off. His personal business was centred on his ownership of flagship hotels, including the Farringford, on the Isle of Wight, once the home of the poet Tennyson. </p> <p>At 80, he joined Ponti's restaurant chain, run by his friend Peter Ispani, and, in 1988, celebrated his 82nd birthday in the Covent Garden Ponti's, which specialised in serving fish and chips with champagne, a supposed levelling taste which was slower to gain ground than his previous ventures. </p> <p>By the 1990s, he was amazing his wife and daughter by his reluctance to ease back on work, taking an active interest in plans for a Euro Pontin company that would eventually take 3,000 trippers a week to Euro-Disney, where he had a 3,000-unit resort. He did not believe in retirement. \"When I take up golf or buy myself a yacht,\" he said, \"see that I am certified.\" </p> <p>After the death of his first wife, Dorothy, he married Joyce Hey last year. She survives him, as does a daughter from his first marriage. </p> <p> <b> Frederick William Pontin, holiday camp founder, born October 24 1906, died September 30 2000 </b> </p>",
  "British judges could be taken to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg for denying litigants a fair hearing if they throw out human rights claims too readily, one of Britain's most senior judges warned last night. <p>Lord Hope, one of the 12 law lords who sit in the House of Lords, said judges had been told they should be \"robust\" in rejecting unmerited claims under the Human Rights Act, which came into force on Monday. </p> <p>The act incorporates the European convention on human rights into UK law, making it directly enforceable in UK courts. But the law lord said he favoured caution over robustness \"lest, in a fit of enthusiasm for throwing cases out, the judges find themselves on the wrong end of a challenge under article 6 of the convention\" - the right to a fair hearing. </p> <p>Lord Hope, who was Scotland's senior judge before his appointment as a law lord, said it was wrong to assume that because few challenges had succeeded north of the border, few would be successful in England. </p> <p>Human rights cases have been possible in Scotland since May 1999, when Scottish devolution took effect. Of some 600 human rights challenges, only around 16 have been successful. But until this week only the Scottish executive and parliament were subject to human rights challenges in the Scottish courts, said Lord Hope. </p> <p>Because the lord advocate, a member of the executive, is responsible for prosecutions, prosecutors' decisions have been open to human rights challenges but not the acts of public bodies generally. Therefore the Scottish experience was no guide to what would happen in England now that all public authorities and bodies performing public functions were open to challenge. </p> <p>\"Now that the way is open for challenges across the entire field of action by public authorities the likely success rate is much less predictable,\" said Lord Hope. \"My guess is that it is likely to increase.\" Giving a lecture sponsored by the law reform group Justice in central London, he said the fact that people no longer had to take their cases to Strasbourg, but could take the simpler and quicker route of applying to courts in the UK, was bound to lead to a great increase in the number of cases brought. </p> <p>\"But I do not see this as a reason for treating applications for relief against breaches of convention rights any more robustly than any other kind of application, or for asking lawyers to exercise greater restraint in the bringing of these applications. </p> <p>\"The tradition in this country is that the courts are open to any person who feels that his rights have been infringed.\" </p> <p>Lord Hope said lawyers owed a duty to their clients, and in July the law lords had removed their immunity from negligence claims over court work. \"So the judges are in no position to complain if counsel err on the side of caution in their own interests in the making of these applications.\"</p>",
  "The coroner halted for a moment, a catch in his voice. John Leckey took refuge in his glass of water, emotion overwhelming him as he read the pathetic, prosaic details, recording in the barest terms how 28 victims of the Omagh massacre two years ago had died. <p>It took him precisely 12 minutes to record the name of each of the dead, his or her occupation - toddler, he gave for one - and the cause of death. Those ranged from decapitation, in the case of Olive Hawkes, 60, married with two children, through laceration of the brain, as with two-year-old Maura Monghan, to the most common of all, multiple injuries. All were due to a bomb explosion. </p> <p>Everybody was aware of what had killed the victims even before Mr Leckey, coroner for Greater Belfast, was drafted for the 19 days of harrowing evidence. They may only have learned the most gory of details over the past four weeks, but they knew the Real IRA had murdered 29 people in the biggest atrocity of what in Northern Ireland are euphemistically dubbed the Troubles. </p> <p>Mr Leckey, a veteran of scores of inquests into terrible slayings, was unable even to say that those who died had been unlawfully killed. His hands were tied, he said, for, unlike in England and Wales, the rules in Northern Ireland permit only the most basic findings of who, when, where and how. </p> <p>So there was an anti-climax as the families drifted away, bent in huddled groups, from the Omagh leisure centre yesterday. They were wondering whether sitting through the shocking video evidence, the horrifying witness testimonies, and the sickening pathology reports, had all been worth it. </p> <p>For some, it was a pointless, painful and even cruel exercise, the outplaying of callous bureaucracy. Others found it cathartic, bringing them tiny solace, another hurdle negotiated in a lonely road they know can never lead to the recovery they crave. </p> <p>Michael Gallagher, whose son and colleague Adrian, 21, was killed, admitted: \"In one way, it was just the carrying out of the duties of the state. Our dead weren't officially recognised as dead until today. </p> <p>\"It was important for us to have the details. We are never going to hear anything worse than we have heard during the inquests. We don't have to wonder any more. </p> <p>\"But the families have been forced to go back for two years. Many see it as a setback.\" </p> <p>Marion Radford, whose son, Alan, 16, died while they were out shopping, said: \"I am glad I came. I had a lot of unanswered questions, but I know now he died rapidly and I was able to meet the policeman who was with Alan's body. That was a great comfort to me, but it has been very painful, like a horror film.\" </p> <p>After delivering his findings, Mr Leckey, who yesterday laid a tribute of lilies in the Co Tyrone town's memorial gardens, told the families: \"The last four weeks have been a difficult time for us all. I personally found it an emotional experience the like of which I have never encountered previously, and which I will never forget. I have no doubt many others found it that way too. </p> <p>\"The investigation of the facts was often unpleasant and distressing, I always knew it was going to be. My strong view is that it would have been quite wrong for me to have engaged in an exercise whose purpose was to sanitise or dilute the horror perpetrated on behalf of the Real IRA. I believe that would not have served the interests of justice and it would have been unfair to the memory of those who did so tragically.\" </p> <p>Mr Leckey, close to tears, defended the work of the police, criticised by some lawyers, including Michael Mansfield QC, who questioned evacuation procedures. He said: \"The age of Robocop has not dawned. It is a film. The police officers who confronted the horror were real men and women, not robots without feelings and emotions. I am sure all who assisted in any way as a consequence of what happened - police officers, traffic wardens, civilians and members of the emergency services - are grateful for the way the bereaved families acknowledged their efforts.\" </p> <p>Mr Leckey continued: \"The Real IRA claimed responsibility for the car bomb, though they sought to pass responsibility to the police for the casualties. As far as I am concerned, they were responsible for all that happened. </p> <p>\"The bomb warnings they gave were inadequate and misleading and the self-serving statement they issued subsequently had been shown to be untrue. If you park a car containing up to 200kg of explosive in a busy shopping street, set a timer, and walk away, you do not walk away from the responsibility for any resultant carnage. </p> <p>\"I share the hope, expressed forcibly by many of the families, that those responsible for the explosion are brought before a court of law. The conclusion of these inquests may close a chapter in the story of the dreadful events that happened in Omagh on August 15 1998, but a criminal trial and convictions will be necessary to close the book.\" </p> <p>The families hope so too. They had a briefing on Monday with Eric Anderson, RUC acting assistant chief constable, leading the investigation into the atrocity, and believe criminal charges will follow. </p> <p>The inquest into the 29th victim, James Barker, 12, the boy whose remains were disinterred from a cemetery in Buncrana, Co Donegal, six months ago, and reburied at home in England, will be held tomorrow. It was delayed because of procedural problems.</p> <p><b>The 29 people who died in the Omagh bombing were:</b> </p> <p><b>Avril Monaghan</b>, 30, Springtown Road, Augher, Co Tyrone, pregnant with twin girls </p> <p><b> Maura Monaghan</b>, 18 months, one of Mrs Monaghan's four children </p> <p><b> Mary Grimes</b>, 65, Patrick's Road, Beragh, Co Tyrone, Mrs Monaghan's mother </p> <p><b> Breda Devine</b>, 20 months, Dunaroe Road, Aughabrack, Donemana, Co Tyrone </p> <p><b> Lorraine Wilson</b>, 15, Camowen Bungalows, Omagh </p> <p><b> Samantha McFarland</b>, 17, Clements Villas, Hospital Road, Omagh </p> <p><b> Gareth Conway</b>, 18, Aghoghan Park, Carrickmore, Co Tyrone </p> <p><b> Julie Hughes</b>, 21, Beltany Road, Omagh </p> <p><b> Brenda Logue</b>, 17, Loughmacrory Park, Carrickmore </p> <p><b> Elizabeth Rush</b>, 57, Michael Street, Omagh </p> <p><b> Rocio Abad-Amos</b>, 23, Victor De La Serra, Madrid, a teacher supervising a group of Spanish and Irish schoolchildren on a day out.

  "The United Kingdom is exceptional in the swiftness and decisiveness of policy-making. Prime ministers, provided they have an adequate majority, are able to make substantial shifts in policy much more rapidly than leaders in any other country in Europe. <p>Here, single-member constituencies and first-past-the-post voting delivers parliamentary majorities; two-party politics is adversarial, with little opportunity for coalition or cross-party negotiation. Unlike in other European countries, trade unions have been unable to influence the policies of either Tory or Labour governments. No constitutional court limits the power of the executive and the powers of the second chamber are being curtailed. Prime ministerial authority has recently been extended - the Cabinet Office now employs more than 200 staff. The Treasury is ascendant. </p> <p>Reform of pensions (the highest spending programme across the European Union) is a good example of how these differences in the capacity of government to shift policy has played out. All face the same problem - ageing populations, leading to rising costs. Other countries spend more on state pensions (most have \"Bismarckian\" social insurance schemes and a much weaker tradition of private pensions than the UK). In most, the proportion of older people will increase more rapidly than in the UK (the chart shows changes in the balance of the pensioner pop ulation). The cost of ageing is thus lower in the UK than elsewhere, yet this is the country that has carried through the most rapid and thoroughgoing reform. </p> <p>Two decades ago, the majority of the British workforce expected to receive the bulk of their pensions from the state through the basic national insurance pension, the state earnings-related pension and means-tested supplementary pension. Reforms by both Tory and Labour governments have relied chiefly on private provision - personal pensions, the new stakeholder pensions or occupational provision. Elsewhere in Europe, policy change has been pursued more gradually. Consensus has been built between political parties and other interests; new policies are essentially adjustments to bring future pension spending within acceptable limits. </p> <p>In Germany, reforms in 1992 and 1999 altered the pension formula to reduce entitlement, removed incentives for early retirement, tapped VAT as an extra source of funding and introduced a \"demographic moderator\", so that pension rates take into account increases in life expectancy. The 1992 reform was supported by all parliamentary parties (except the Greens) and by both business and unions. The 1999 reform evolved through extended discussions between government and opposition parties (the Rentenkonsensgespr\u00e4che). </p> <p>Sweden, stronghold of social democratic universalist welfare, has also altered the formula and introduced a demographic moderator. An innovative scheme diverts a small proportion of contributions (2% of income) into a private funded scheme to supplement the state earnings-related pension. The basic pension has effectively become means-tested. The package was negotiated through a commission which involved the five main parties and representatives of pensioners' organisations in a broad investigation from 1984 to 1990. All five parties supported consensus legislation in 1994, which then gained a 90% majority. </p> <p>In France, the Balladur government introduced reforms which required longer contribution periods, eliminated incentives for early retirement and weakened the formula linking contributions to benefits for private-sector workers in the early 1990s. These changes were achieved through concessions to the unions which reinforced their role in the management of the schemes. When Alain Jupp\u00e9 attempted to extend this to the large French public sector in 1995, he ne glected to smooth the path with unions and a national transport strike forced abandonment of the scheme. </p> <p>In Italy, the Amato reforms of 1992 introduced some restrictions after extended debate. When Silvio Berlusconi sought more severe cuts (reminiscent of UK experience) in 1994, union resistance was one of the major factors leading to the fall of his government. The technocratic Dini administration negotiated a further reform package with unions and a coalition of leftwing parties and introduced it in 1995. More recently, Romano Prodi's attempt to introduce further cuts (at the recommendation of the 1997 Onofri commission) was confounded by opposition from his leftwing coalition partners. In all these countries, tax reforms are under way to encourage the growth of private funded pensions alongside the state sector, but have as yet had little impact. </p> <p>UK governments are precipitate because, once in power, they encounter fewer restraints. It is simply not possible for other leaders to put their policy ideas into practice without extensive negotiations, because they have to deal with coalition partners, stronger trade unions and political cultures where negotiation with the main interests on the major issues confronting the government is normal. Our policy-makers are swift and decisive - but the fact that we do not need to generate consensus for major policy upheavals leaves UK policy shifts vulnerable to fresh reforms from the next government. Proposals made in Bournemouth this week could in theory become public policy within a matter of months. </p> <p> Peter Taylor-Gooby is professor of social policy at the University of Kent </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Kevin Keegan thought aloud yesterday about taking home a Wembley seat as a souvenir after Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Germany, preferably one from the royal box. But while the queen's sit-upon has a certain curiosity value the three points to be gained from beating Germany would be priceless by comparison. </p> <p>For Keegan and England this is a unique week. True, they met the Germans only four months ago, beating them 1-0 in Charleroi during Euro 2000, but this will be the last match at Wembley before it is demolished and the game will be played against a background of poignancy and nostalgia which, from an English point of view, must not be allowed to trespass on the practical needs of the job in hand. </p> <p>Keegan is well aware of the need not to be distracted by historical echoes. \"I think it's a fitting match for the last game at the old Wembley,\" he said yesterday. \"The players are aware of that but I think they are very focused. A lot of this stuff is going to go on around them but it will not affect their performance.\" </p> <p>When it comes to demolition jobs Uli Hoeness, a regular member of West Germany's outstanding team of the 70s, appears to have done his utmost to take a steel ball to the present side's newly repaired confidence. </p> <p>Hoeness, the Bayern Munich general manager, was quoted in the German sports magazine Kicker as saying that Bayer Leverkusen's coach Christoph Daum, due to take over the national squad from Rudi V\u00f6ller next summer, has effectively disqualified himself as a fit person for the post after sex and drugs allegations about him appeared in a German newspaper. </p> <p>The legal wheels in Germany are already rolling while an unhappy V\u00f6ller has appealed to his country's media not to question any of his players about the controversy. </p> <p>The row is unlikely to affect Germany's approach to Saturday, unless it further stiffens their resolve. Keegan refused to comment on Hoeness's allegations yesterday and the matter will probably be no more relevant to the result than was the defection of Rudolf Hess to the course of the second world war. </p> <p>Not that a second England win against Germany this year can ever be a matter for comfortable assumption. Not only has V\u00f6ller restored life to the enfeebled team who slunk disconsolately out of the European championship; he has also made adjustments to Erich Ribbeck's team - Ribbeck resigned after Germany's embarrassing first-round exit - calculated to make them stronger in areas where England may still be relatively weak. </p> <p>V\u00f6ller's five-man midfield may permutate the Bayer Leverkusen pair of Carsten Ramelow and Michael Ballack, along with Dietmar Hamann and Marco Bode, to establish an early ascendancy while Sebastian Deisler and Christian Ziege pose a threat on the wings. Unless Keegan switches to a similar 3-5-2 formation England will be outnumbered in the central positions from the start. </p> <p>Either way Keegan will spend part of the next 48 hours debating whether or not to start the game with Steven Gerrard, so impressive when he came on in the final half-hour against Germany in Charleroi, in midfield along side Paul Scholes. The alternative is to go with the greater experience of Paul Ince, along with his limitations. </p> <p>Joe Cole, the 18-year-old West Ham United prodigy whose inclusion in the squad for the first time is a healthy sign of things to come, will almost certainly start on the bench. \"Joe's aim has to be trying to get involved in this game as one of the 22,\" Keegan explained yesterday. \"I think that's the best he can hope for on Saturday.\" </p> <p>Up front Michael Owen, whose goal as a late substitute in France last month enabled England to force a 1-1 draw with the world and European champions, looks certain to start alongside Andy Cole. \"Michael's had a tremendous start to the season and I did say after the France game that I would change things for Germany.\" </p> <p>Cole was used as a lone striker in Paris, with Scholes playing off him, but Keegan will not repeat the experiment on Saturday. \"I would be very unlikely to play one striker at home,\" he said. \"I think you would have to go back to the Domesday Book to see the last time I did that.\" </p> <p>As it is, England have to go back 25 years to the last time they beat a German team at Wembley. Germany, moreover, have won on their last four visits if their \"golden goal\" triumph over the Czech Republic in the final of Euro 96 and the victory on penalties over Terry Venables's side in the semi-finals are included. </p> <p>Kieron Dyer, who has a twisted knee, is England's only serious fitness doubt at present and Keegan is optimistic that his squad will have a clean bill of health by tomorrow morning. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
