  "<p>I have just one certificate stuck to the cork board above my desk, but what I did to get it is something I'm particularly proud of, and also a little embarrassed about. It certifies that I successfully completed a flight aboard a British Airways aircraft - there is even a photograph of the very plane, a Boeing 757, way above the white cliffs of Dover. When I look at this picture, I often wonder how I got through this flight. Perhaps I should have made a lunge for the emergency exit and bailed out. Or kicked and screamed until the pilot turned back. You see, I did once get off an aircraft shortly before it taxied to the runway. That was a couple of years before I undertook the fear-of-flying course; a couple of years during which I steadily lost touch with reality. </p> <p>Fear of flying is totally irrational, or so I've been told countless times, but when you experience it, it seems the most logical thing in the world. And it can take your breath away, literally, because it's not just a mental condition; it has powerful physical symptoms, too. What might at first seem to be a dull ache in your stomach quickly spreads throughout your body, so you hurt all over. Meanwhile, your heart rate begins to shoot up, along with your blood pressure, and you start to sweat profusely. You become nauseous. And everything appears to close in around you. You feel as if you are about to implode. You don't exactly feel rigid with fear, more you just feel totally crushed by it. </p> <p>The symptoms first manifested themselves on a Swissair Airbus that was about to depart Geneva for London Heathrow. They were so bad that neither the cabin crew, or even my uncle with whom I was travelling, could have persuaded me to stay on board. </p> <p>Perspiring and shaking wildly, I finally stood up, grabbed my hand luggage, muttered something to my uncle about taking the train, and stumbled for the exit. I didn't look back. I was allowed to get off because the plane had been delayed for more than an hour-and-a-half due to a \"technical problem\", and a few other businessmen sitting in the front of the plane were also getting off, though clearly for very different reasons. </p> <p>Had there not been a \"technical problem\", I'm pretty sure I would have completed this flight, albeit very nervously. As it was, the longer we sat on the Tarmac, with men in overalls wandering on board every so often, the more anxious I became. In fact, at one point the plane actually pushed back from the stand and was heading for the runway, engines roaring, or, rather, sort of whining, only to return a number of minutes later. The pilot eventually explained that a computer would have to be changed, although this was a pretty quick operation and we would be off shortly. I, however, couldn't help thinking that it would be a lot easier to get off - after a while, I couldn't bare to look at what was going on (in retrospect, I think this was because I didn't want to witness an engineer making a mistake, not that I would have known what that would have looked like). With each new setback, I was more convinced that this plane was never going to make it to London and that it was going to crash, that we were all going to die, gruesomely - my anxiety and the corresponding physical symptoms spiralling ever more out of control. </p> <p>The source of my phobia was a Swissair Airbus (for all I know, it might have been the very same) leaving Geneva for London almost one year earlier. Everything was going smoothly that day. There were no delays, the evening sky appeared clear - a beautiful, deep mauve colour with a few snowy peaks just visible. Travelling for work, I happened to be sitting in the business section and was more concerned with the newspaper I had been handed than anything that was going on around me. We took off right on schedule - that I remember, as I was eager to get back in time for dinner with my fianc\u00e9e. A few seconds later, just as we were at what seemed to be the steepest (and slowest) point of the climb, there was a huge bang, an explosive bang. An electric-blue flash shot through the cabin, along the side walls and aisle, the overhead lockers and right under my feet. A number of people screamed, though not at the front of the plane, not in business class. Then there was this eerie silence. No one even rustled their paper as we waited for the plane to start tumbling back to earth. </p> <p>My first thought was, wow, I'm going to die in a plane crash. Me. Why me? And why now? I had just got engaged. I had recently sold my first novel. I had a terrific new job. For about the first time in my life everything was going right. Then wham. But instead of plunging to earth, the plane kept on climbing. Up in the plush business section, we started to look at one another quizzically. After what seemed like for ever, but what must have been four or five minutes, the pilot came on the PA to say that the plane had been hit by lightning but there was nothing to worry about. They had run a number of checks and we were to continue to London Heathrow, where we were still expected to land on time. </p> <p>Over the next year I flew a great deal - I had little option. My \"terrific\" new job was in fact travel editor of an international newspaper. Refusing to accept that I had suddenly become afraid of flying - I never talked about the lightning strike - I found myself drinking more and more heavily before I got on a plane. And then I started making up all sorts of excuses to get out of going on trips, particularly those involving developing countries or eastern European airlines, or airlines that used Airbuses. I'd ring ahead to check. Looking back, I see that I turned down Brazil, Mexico, Morocco twice, Budapest and Prague. </p> <p>As well as the alcohol, I also began consuming handfuls of beta-blockers that my doctor had prescribed for me. Beta-blockers are meant to help reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety, and with those out of the way, without your heart pumping like mad, it's supposedly easier to think about something other than your anxiety - though I think that I found the drink more effective. When I went to New York on Concorde, I consumed so much Dom P\u00e9rignon 1985 Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon that we could have left the stratosphere completely and zoomed off into space for all I would have known. Then I tried to go everywhere on Eurostar, and despite on one occasion being stuck in the tunnel for four hours (three of which were in darkness), I still vastly preferred the experience to flying. It simply didn't set my mind racing with so many catastrophic thoughts. </p> <p>Yet why I let myself in for another Geneva hop, on Swissair, almost exactly a year after I thought I was going to be in a fatal crash, I still can't quite explain - perhaps I was testing myself. However, once on the Tarmac, in this Airbus that obviously had a serious technical problem, I knew I wouldn't be so lucky a second time - I had already been warned. My fate was sealed. Suddenly flying didn't just frighten me; I had developed a phobia about it. All rationality had gone out of the window. Why would Swissair, an airline with one of the best safety records in the world, allow a dodgy plane to take off? </p> <p>Of course, I knew that nothing would happen to the plane - I left my uncle on it, after all - just as I knew flying was one of the safest forms of travel. Still, I was glad I got off that plane. I remember walking through the terminal building, heading for the train, feeling a huge weight had lifted. I suppose in succumbing to my anxiety, my phobia, I at least recognised that I had a problem. </p> <p>For a while I let things get really out of hand. I read everything I could find about planes and their safety records. Regardless of the statistics, I would always come to the conclusion that none of them was that safe. There was always a crash somewhere to prove my point, or suddenly a plane with an impeccable safety record, such as the Concorde, would fall appallingly out of the sky. </p> <p>I pored over articles on specific crashes - the Valujet DC-9 that slammed into a Florida swamp, the TWA Boeing 747 that blew up in midair just out of JFK, the Swissair MD11 that came down in Nova Scotia, the Romanian A310 that barely had time to become airborne after leaving Bucharest airport. I read somewhere that all the pathologist had to identify the pilot of a Boeing 737 (the most popular commercial jet in the world) that crashed in Pittsburgh was the sole of his foot, a slither of charred flesh. A friend, who works for a big City bank, passed me an internal report that graded airlines by their safety records so its employees could decide which they would feel happiest flying with. I can tell you that at the bottom of this listwas Macedonian Airlines, closely followed by Azerbaijan Airlines, Kazakhstan Airlines and Orbi Georgian Airlines - not, of course, that I had ever flown with any of these. </p> <p>A short while later, the same friend (friend?) passed me some information that I thought at the time proved my phobia wasn't quite so irrational, that I'd been on the right track all along. It included the terrifying fact that cars are actually 12 times safer than planes and that, of all modes of transport, only motorbikes are more dangerous. This statistic was arrived at by calculating the number of trips taken, as opposed to the norm of looking at the deaths per distances travelled. Even, apparently, if you measure the fatality rate per man-hour of exposure to a particular form of transport, cars and planes come out pretty evenly. </p> <p>Gradually, I became aware of not just how common my condition was, but that I wasn't the only travel writer who was afraid of flying. Aside from numerous tales of head-banging turbulence and engine fires, aborted takeoffs and undercarriage failures, many of my former colleagues feared that because they flew so much, by the law of averages one day their time would be up. But regardless of all this, and irrespective of how you skew the figures (and even if there has just been a terrible crash - you can usually find at least one major incident in the world in any given month), flying is remarkably safe, and getting safer. The overall accident rate per flight stands at one in a million, well down from 50 in a million in the 60s. </p> <p>Yet, to the phobic mind, these figures are meaningless - the plane you are on is going to crash, and nothing anyone says can distract you from that thought. I like to think that I eventually left my travel editor job for other reasons (to concentrate on my novel-writing, say, and to spend more time with my new wife), but it is conceivable that my fear of flying played a considerable part. </p> <p>With my feet planted firmly on the ground, I began to question why flying affects so many people in such a negative way (some say up to half the adult population fear it) - why exactly it generates all this anxiety. I wondered whether I would ever be able to get on a plane without my palms becoming clammy and this heaving sensation starting up in my chest. In fact, I wondered whether I would ever be able to get on a plane again. Why was I being so bloody irrational about it? I just couldn't get my mind to accept the reality of the situation - that I wasn't going to die every time I stepped on to a plane, even if it were to be involved in an incident. Planes are obviously well built enough to withstand lightning strikes, as well as all sorts of mechanical and systems failures. I then started to think about the nature of phobias. My doctor intimated that what most phobias ultimately do is mask some other, probably deeper-rooted anxiety. So what else was troubling me? What had the Geneva incident really triggered? </p> <p>By the time I eventually enrolled on a fear-of-flying course, I had already got somewhere with containing my phobia, even if I hadn't yet got that far with understanding what lay behind it. I had decided to set my next novel on a plane, thinking that an object capable of inspiring such powerful feelings in me would provide great source material. Or, if you like, I wanted to put my obsession, my pre-eminent anxiety, to good use. Plus, I've always thought of my writing as a kind of therapy, a way of exorcising demons, of trying to confront long-buried issues - of working out who I am and where I come from. And I also wanted to know what made the cabin crew tick, what made them able to spend their lives flying around the world fearlessly. As it was, I soon discovered that they aren't all that fearless. </p> <p>A friend who once worked for Virgin told me how turbulence used to frighten her so badly that she often found herself screaming out loud, much to the alarm of nearby passengers. She resigned after a particularly bumpy transatlantic flight. A senior BA purser I came across said that he was fine to begin with, but that after almost a decade he couldn't cope with it any more unless he took a Valium. And, in the course of my research, I heard numerous other tales of drug and alcohol dependency among cabin crew, of people locking themselves in the crew rest area, of people not going to work at all because flying suddenly scared the wits out of them. </p> <p>In the course of my research, I managed a number of flights (specifically eight - four return trips to New York, which is the route in my book) without resorting to my usual cocktail of beer and beta-blockers, by convincing myself that because I was writing a novel set on a plane it would be too extraordinary for me to die in a plane crash. I felt I was somehow invincible - which, if nothing else, illustrates how phobias can really twist your mind, your rationality. At least I was able to concentrate on my surroundings, trying to observe everything in the name of research, rather than worry about a bomb going off in the cargo hold, or the chances of being in a midair collision. </p> <p>In the past, I hadn't even been able to look out of the window and always asked for an aisle seat, then I'd cower behind newspapers and magazines. Now, I'd stare at the cloud formations, the sun dipping behind a cresting wave of stratocumulus, and think, yeah, actually this is pretty beautiful. I'd listen to the steady, almost reassuring trilling of the engines, rather than turn up the volume on my headset. I'd no longer fight the sense of motion, but let my body relax into the seat (as much as that's ever possible). </p> <p>It was amazing, too, watching the cabin crew scuttling up and down the aisles, dealing with demanding passengers, handing out the hot meals (or \"hots\", as they say in the business), and every so often checking that their hair was in place. I suppose what slowly struck me - and this was after I had ventured into numerous galleys for a gossip - was the fact that they weren't some alien species. They were just like you and me - certainly me, in the way they worried about their relationships and their social lives, about their job security and who was bitching about them behind their back. Except everything seemed to be so condensed. It was as if they were operating on fast-forward. They weren't just suddenly overfamiliar with each other; they had affairs and bust-ups on one-night stopovers that would have taken months to materialise in normal jobs. Taking all this in suddenly seemed much more interesting than worrying about the plane crashing. </p> <p>So when I turned up for the fear-of-flying course - which I had booked months beforehand - I was feeling surprisingly confident thanks to this whole new agenda my phobia had provoked and the knowledge (both social and technical) that I had already gained through my research. In many ways, I felt that I had largely overcome my fear of flying, or at least had learned to cope with it. I honestly believed that the BA-approved course would be a breeze, that I might come top of the class. </p> <p>What I did not realise was that most people who are seriously afraid of flying know an enormous amount about it. There were people attending (about 150 in all, and a pretty even mix between men and women) who recalled crashes I'd never heard of, people who could describe the workings of a modern aircraft just as competently as the smooth-talking pilots taking the course. And whenever one of the course instructors said some flight system or particular control was infallible - bound by what is known in the industry as in-built redundancy - there was always someone who could successfully contradict him. </p> <p>\"Turbulence is not comfortable,\" we were told to recite, \"but it is not dangerous.\" Which, sadly, isn't quite true, someone pointed out - a number of passengers have apparently died in midair due to severe turbulence. And planes aren't immune to lightning strikes, either - in 1976, an Iranian jumbo jet was reported to have exploded after being struck just outside Madrid. </p> <p>My early confidence quickly subsided - the gloomy surroundings of the bland Heathrow airport hotel, where the course was being held, didn't help. I had clearly been kidding myself that I had somehow got over my fear of flying. In fact, what I had probably been doing was just hiding it, or, I suppose, smothering it behind the whole idea of my novel. As we moved on from the technical aspects of the course to the mental issues, it became increasingly apparent that I had been ignoring the issue of phobias and, more important, what really lies behind them (and concentrating on cabin crew gossip instead). It transpires that people afflicted with a fear of flying roughly divide into two groups. There are those whose fear comes from unfamiliarity with the experience and those who, for whatever reason, have developed a phobia. The first lot are easy enough to treat. It's the second lot, people like me, who are the problem. </p> <p>The psychotherapists, who came along for the afternoon, tried, much as my doctor had, to suggest that it is ourselves who are making us anxious and not the aircraft. They said that very often fear is self-administered and that we simply allow our imaginations to play tricks on us. However, they didn't go much beyond telling us to think of pleasant thoughts - ie, to indulge in a bit of positive thinking, which, to a degree, I had already started to do. Mind you, I can't blame them for not expanding further on the issue - it probably would have taken them a few years to sort us lot out, not an afternoon. One of them said something, however, shortly before we were to board the plane for our \"test\" flight, that took me right back to the Geneva incident. </p> <p>\"Remember,\" this patient, soft-voiced, middle-aged woman said, \"anxiety breeds anxiety.\" The time my plane was struck by lightning just so happened to coincide with a great change in my life. I had recently become engaged, accepted a new job, put my flat on the market, sold my first novel, and, I suddenly recalled, been mugged. I'm now certain that the shock of the lightning strike had somehow jumbled all this up in my mind. </p> <p>All my anxiety about having been mugged, and concern over whether my first novel, new job and quite possibly impending marriage would all be the huge success I hoped them to be, shifted on to the very tangible experience of flying. What was suddenly so good about life became confused because of a traumatic experience. </p> <p>I'm not sure how effective the course was in getting me to recognise this, or whether I was moving, albeit slowly, in that direction (or maybe even the opposite direction), anyway. I'm not sure that you could say I was your normal fear-of-flying candidate, being a novelist and perhaps particularly susceptible to neuroses and heightened levels of anxiety. Though from the people I met on the course (and while researching my novel), I reckon a phobia about flying can hit anyone, even an air steward. It took me a long while - almost three years - to recognise all this, and also the very obvious and related fact that flying is about letting go or, rather, relinquishing control (unless you happen to be the pilot). </p> <p>In a way, I see overcoming my phobia - or at least beginning to understand what lay behind it - as a sign of growing up, as a sign of finally accepting that the world doesn't just revolve around me. However, part of me can't help feeling increasingly queasy about having now actually written this novel set on a plane - a novel, as it has turned out, about not just flying but also about relationships and commitment, desire and anxiety. </p> <p>I haven't flown since publication day, because I am worried that I might just be tempting fate once again. The one, probably very obvious, question that I can't recall being asked on the course, was: \"What do you do if the phobia returns?\" As with alcoholism, or any form of addiction, do you ever really get over a fear of flying? </p> <p>\u0095 Henry Sutton is the author of Flying, published by Sceptre, priced \u00a314.99.</p>",
  "<p>\"Pronto?\" I lift the phone in our bedroom. \"My name is Paolo Baldassarre and I wish to speak to the writer Mr Timothy Parks.\" It's a breathless, urgent, demanding voice that drags me back 10 years and more. </p> <p>\"Paolo!\" </p> <p>\"I'll get Rita,\" I tell him; his younger sister, my wife. </p> <p>But he wants to speak to me. </p> <p>\"Next week we'll be seeing each other\" he says. </p> <p>\"That's right. I'm looking forward to it\" </p> <p>\"I want you to know I've changed. I'm very sorry about what happened.\" </p> <p>My last glimpse of Paolo was on the platform at Verona station when I pointed him out to the police. He had announced he was coming to Verona, where I live, to kill me. Shabby, frantic, and obese, he waved three or four bunches of keys as they took him away; he had slipped one round each finger to form a sort of gothic knuckleduster. Shortly afterwards we received a visit from Italy's elite anti-terrorist police. Paolo had written to tell them I was working with Mossad to eliminate Palestinians in Italy. Now, a decade on, I assure him there are no hard feelings. \"I'd like you to help get the Anglo-American sanctions against me lifted,\" he says. \"In time for my release, the year after next.\" </p> <p>He explains that he needs to purchase an academic book called Symbolic Logic. Only the American publisher is demanding \u00a3600 for a hardback edition because of the sanctions against him. He must complete his education before leaving the institute. That is imperative. \"As you know my father never let me study,\" he announces. \"He poisoned my orange juice.\" </p> <p>I mildly suggest that all this is bullshit. \"I bet I can get you a hefty discount on that book, Paolo.\" He changes tack. For five minutes we enjoy a completely normal brother-in-law conversation. \"A presto,\" I sign off. </p> <p>Paolo was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic some 25 years ago when he and Rita were studying in the United States, she at UMass Amherst, he at the University of Albany. The previous semester Paolo had written home asking if his mother would come to live with him. Then at a certain point he had stopped responding to either letters or phone calls. This had gone on for months. Finally Rita took the bus to Albany. She found her brother barricaded in his room in a supposedly supervised dorm, ankle-deep in filth, delirious and hallucinating. Nobody had noticed anything. </p> <p>Sent back from Albany to his family, he began a long series of fruitless, short-lived therapies. He seemed abnormally attached to and at the same time extremely antagonistic towards his parents. Incapable of forming relationships with girls he mailed pornography to his sister and myself. From time to time he disappeared and lived as a bum, practised various kinds of self-mutilation, attempted to buy an Algerian prostitute as a bride, \"ran rings\", as he boasts, round a number of analysts, and read some of the most advanced books on quantum physics ever published. Or at least, those books were purchased for him, often at considerable expense. </p> <p>He was for many years a considerable financial burden, emotional strain and even potential physical danger to his parents. When violent he could be forced to stay in hospital and take the neuroleptic drugs that calmed him down. But then the law required he be released and, being well aware of the long-term negative side effects of the drugs, he stopped taking them. Very soon the paranoid delusions and agitation would begin again. </p> <p>In the end it was only after he had committed a serious crime that he could be imprisoned and forced to take medicine on a regular basis for a long time. This happened seven years ago. Paolo held his mother at knifepoint, then smashed up the family home with a sledgehammer. Since then his parents have visited him fortnightly, first in high-security jails, then in the less restrictive mental institutions. But on New Year's Day 1999 my father-in-law died. Now his wife - we both call her Mamma - who never learned to drive, needs someone else to take her to where Paolo is presently based, way up in the rugged highlands between Genoa and Savona, a place apparently unreachable by public transport. </p> <p>My mother-in-law arrives in Verona on the train from the family home in Pescara some 300 miles to the south on the Adriatic coast. Going to bed at nine she tells us we must be up at the crack of dawn to set off on the drive west to Genoa. She is irritated when Rita and I refuse to start before 7.30am. In the car there's my mother-in-law, my wife, myself and Lucia, our five-year-old daughter. But the presence of little children was never an obstacle to adult conversation in the Baldassarre family. The old lady begins to talk about her husband's bones. Adelmo was buried in the earth, but in Italy the authorities remove the remains after 15 years in order to recycle the space. \"Under no circumstances,\" Mamma says heatedly, \"are those bones ever to be moved into my family tomb. Do you understand that, Rita? I will not have that whoremonger's bones in my family tomb.\" </p> <p>Theirs was an embattled marriage. My father-in-law frequently said the happiest times with Mamma were in the car, he driving while she slept. Towards the end they lived in separate apartments on the same decaying family property. Struck by a massive heart attack, having no phone in his apartment, Adelmo staggered over to knock on her windows in the middle of the night. She called an ambulance and went back to bed, believing he had overeaten again. In hospital he didn't wish to see her and she made no attempt to visit. Three days later he was dead. </p> <p>My wife steers the conversation to Mamma's favourite subject: the possibility that now, after seven years' imprisonment, Paolo will be allowed out for a week in order to come down to visit her in Pescara. Mamma becomes extremely cheerful and excited. There is even a catch in her voice, as of someone looking forward to a week's pure evasion, with a lover perhaps, in any event a bliss beyond which life need never resume again. </p> <p>The institute houses 40 or so men and women who seem emblematic of all that is run-down and futureless, shuffling vacantly from room to room or standing catatonic in corners. After a few minutes Paolo appears. To my immense relief, apart from the hollow, hunted eyes, the hunched shoulders, and the fact that on a hot day he is wearing at least five layers of shirts, jumpers and jackets, he seems pretty normal. We exchange friendly greetings and even a hug. I had not fully understood, despite my wife's warnings, that the difficult person to deal with during this encounter would not be Paolo, but Mamma. \"Look at the make-up she's put on for him,\" Rita had whispered that morning. </p> <p> Immediately Mamma is kissing her son, almost on the lips. She disengages, but only to throw out her arms and embrace him again, kiss again. Seconds later she's adjusting the collar of one of his shirts. It's not straight. It's not clean. And his hair's too long. He hasn't been eating enough. Has he eaten? She apologises that we didn't arrive at 10, as she promised. Paolo merely nods amiably, informing us that he's already had his lunch, but that he'll be happy to sit beside us while we eat at our hotel. </p> <p>Some 30 years ago, in the crazy 60s, a group of psychotherapists concluded that many mental disorders, including schizophrenia, might be related to the family relationships surrounding the sufferers. A form of therapy was developed which involved getting the whole family together and trying to change the way people behaved with each other. Some successes were scored, particularly with anorexia, but any number of sensibilities were offended too. Who wants to hear that they are even indirectly responsible for anything? The feminists ran to the defence of the mothers who were being made scapegoats. Parents' associations complained about public money being spent on such mad ideas. And particularly with chronic schizophrenia, the results of this kind of therapy were disappointing, so it's hardly surprising that by the mid-80s the game was up. The medical profession settled back into its traditional vision that schizophrenia is basically the result of a biological disorder. </p> <p>So today, if you consult the latest literature, you'll be told that the disorder is partly genetic (though how big a part they can't say), or that it may be due to an abnormally large right brain hemisphere (though many schizophrenics don't have this and many who aren't do), or that it's the result of an unidentified virus contracted in the womb but mysteriously clicking in not when they're cutting the umbilical cord, but 20 years later. </p> <p>Observe us, then, as we sit down to lunch, a perfectly \"normal\" family except that 25 years ago one member sadly succumbed to this hypothetical organic anomaly, or gene defect, or virus. The hotel restaurant is empty but the proprietress offers to rustle up tagliatelle and ragout followed by a steak. So far, Paolo's behaviour is exemplary. He is still crazy, already bothering Rita with the story of the hugely expensive Symbolic Logic and international sanctions. But he is calm and pleasant. \"No, no tagliatelle for me,\" he tells the waitress cheerfully. \"I've already had an excellent lunch, thanks.\" </p> <p>\"Bring a plate for him as well,\" his mother says. </p> <p>\"Mamma,\" Rita protests. \"He says he's eaten!,' she tells the waitress. \"Bring a plate for my son,\" the old lady orders. </p> <p>\"Mamma, no, I've had enough.\" </p> <p>\"You're thin,\" she accuses. </p> <p>Proudly, Paolo begins to explain that over the last two months he's managed to lose 10 pounds. </p> <p>\"Bring tagliatelle for him as well!\" </p> <p>\"Mamma, for Christ's sake!\" I wade in. \"The guy's an adult. He knows whether he wants to eat or not!\" </p> <p>\"You understand nothing!\" she yells at me. \"Nothing! He's starving himself.\" </p> <p>But exactly as we gang up against Mamma, Paolo turns his head to the waitress and says, \"Yes, do bring me a plate.\" Then immediately he embraces his mother. He begins to caress her wrists and neck and face. One hand has slipped inside the arm of her short-sleeved dress. She is kissing him. \"Mammina,\" he says. \"Mammina. You're all I have left now. There's only us two. Just a few years together,' he whimpers. \" Povero, povero ,\" she says with immense satisfaction at our expense. But as he pulls away from her, he demands: \"So, have you brought the money? I want my money.\" </p> <p>One of the purposes of these trips is to bring Paolo his monthly spending money. </p> <p>\"We'll have to talk about that later\" Mamma says. </p> <p>\"But you can't not give me my money,\" he whines. </p> <p>\"Tell me about the therapy,\" I ask when we're back in the car. \"Just pills,\" he says. He names an impressive list of drugs, mostly dopamine-blockers, clearly relishing his expertise. \"We're all schizophrenics,\" he says candidly, \"all nuts, so we need these things. Sometimes people do smash the place up, then they get a big injection.\" </p> <p>I begin to notice that Paolo's conversation is mostly normal so long as you don't touch on two key subjects: the reasons for his illness or \"failure in life\", and the possibilities for his future. If this is the effect of a virus, it sure is an odd one. </p> <p>I ask him if they ever try to reduce the amount of drugs, to see if he still needs them. He says yes. \"And how is it?\" \"Fine.\" \"So why don't they reduce them some more?\" \"They can't,\" he says, \"because the levels were stipulated in the sentence that condemned me to my imprisonment.\" \"I bet that's not true,\" I tell him. \"I try to get better,\" he says, \"so that I'll be ready to come out in two years' time.\" I say nothing, because we all know that he can only come out when a psychiatrist decides he's well enough. </p> <p>I can't help but feel he's engaging me in a sort of teasing game, inviting me to discuss serious questions, then suddenly retreating into fantasy when I poke my nose where I shouldn't. In each case these fantasies have to do with things that blocked him in the past or are preventing him from having any future now. In the past there was his father's perfidy, ordering that he couldn't study, couldn't marry and putting poison in his food. Now there is the court ruling about his level of drug treatment and the Anglo-American conspiracy demanding he pay thousands of dollars for books. </p> <p>He turns in his seat. \"Mammina, Mammina. You're the only one who cares for me.\" </p> <p>Mamma smiles and begins to talk about his possible visit to Pescara. \"That would be wonderful,\" he agrees. \"So nice. I can see my old room. You will give me the money, won't you, Mammina?\" </p> <p>At the institute again, two big surprises are in store. The first is a bus stopping right outside. And where does that bus come from? From Savona. So it would be possible, after all, for Mamma to take the train to Savona and then the bus to the institute! We discuss the situation. Paolo is extremely sensible. \"Why on earth come so often, Mamma?\" he asks, \"especially when it's so hot. Wait till October.\" </p> <p>But Mamma has always insisted that she must visit him once a month if possible, once every two months at least, even though the doctors have suggested that these visits have a negative effect on Paolo. </p> <p>\"You can send the money by post,\" he suggests. She says she'll think about it. But as soon as Paolo goes off to the bathroom for a moment, she hisses, \"What on earth am I supposed to do with him if I come without a car? What am I going to say to him all day?\" </p> <p>Briefly I imagine lovers who don't share the same language and who have been forbidden to embrace. What can they do but, as we did, drive around while others do the talking? That is why Rita and I are here, not because Mamma needed transport. We are chaperones to their mad mismatch. </p> <p>When Paolo returns Mamma is very businesslike and says it's time to sort out the money. Reluctantly, she gives him what he wants. </p> <p>The second surprise comes when the psychiatrist finally ushers us in. I'd thought Mamma was going to ask whether Paolo could be granted leave to go down to Pescara. Instead she starts complaining about some detail related to her son's disabled person's pension. She rails about the tangles of Italian bureaucracy. The doctor agrees and seems to think the interview is over. </p> <p>\"But what about the visit to Pescara?\" I ask. Mamma leans over to whisper, \"He'll never grant it. I asked last time.\" But I feel that if we don't ask, the interview will have been wasted. \"We've been wondering,\" I say, \"if Paolo is well enough to spend a few days with the family in Pescara.\" </p> <p>\"What do you think, Paolo?\" he asks. </p> <p>Paolo is clearly unhappy. \"I'd like to go,\" he hesitates, \"so long as no one touches my room here.\" </p> <p>\"Of course nobody will touch it,\" the doctor says. \"That's fine then. Let's say, in three or four months' time, shall we?\" </p> <p> Suddenly I see that the doctor knows perfectly well this visit will never happen because neither Mamma nor Paolo wants it. So his words are completely empty. Vaguely he grants what they vaguely ask. Thus he integrates himself perfectly in the way they operate together. They can fantasise about it, without needing to clinch anything. As soon as we're out Rita asks: \"Paolo, did they ever suggest you have some therapy with the family?\" </p> <p>Actually, I know she knows the answer to this. We discussed it with her father once. Paolo nods. He's very matter-of-fact. He did two sessions with Babbo, he says, but Mamma wouldn't come. </p> <p>\"That's not true,\" she exclaims. </p> <p>\"Yes it is,\" Paolo is mild and matter-of-fact, completely convincing, \"I remember you said you didn't want to come.\" </p> <p>Mamma is furious. \"Do you think I wouldn't have come if it could have been useful for you? I can't believe this!\" </p> <p>Immediately he withdraws and we're back to the Mammina routine. Apparently it is impossible for him to comment openly on his mother's contradictory behaviour, her strange mixture of love and recalcitrance. Or could it be that he actually wants things this way, encourages this behaviour? Certainly there's no question here of any one person being solely to blame, it's more the way each person's behaviour complements the other's that seems so unhealthy. </p> <p>On the drive back, we start talking about the building work that must be done on the family property. But this only leads Mamma to attack Babbo again. \"So why did your father marry me?\" Mamma suddenly demands, \"if all he wanted was his whores and sluts?\" Fortunately little Lucia is asleep. As evening draws on, speeding along this turnpike that my parents-in-law drove up and down so many times, it comes to me that in this family to talk about anything always means to talk about everything, because nothing has ever been resolved between them. The whole family is somehow marooned in the ambiguous behaviour of my father-in-law exactly 50 years ago when he married a woman without apparently wanting to, yet at the same time forever promising that one day there would be the dreamt-of resolution, the whole family together and happy by the sea in Pescara. </p> <p>It's a mentality that fits perfectly with the contemporary and strictly organic approach to schizophrenia. For the time being the patient can be tranquillized on what are truly very sophisticated drugs. If one has to be marooned somewhere, it's as well to keep the anguish levels low. Anyhow, nothing else can be done and it's certainly no one's fault - unless, that is, we're going to be so primitive as to believe that people can really drive each other mad. </p> <p>In the 25 years of Paolo's illness no one has suggested to Mamma that she might look for different ways of behaving with her son. No one has suggested that her weirdly intense relationship with him might have anything to do with the unhappy prevarications of her husband. But then, why bother? In the future, when medical research finally gets there, the whole disorder will be cleared up with an appropriate medicine and everybody can go on behaving exactly as they please. </p> <p>\u0095 A longer version of this piece appears in the current issue of Granta magazine: Shrinks, available now in bookshops for \u00a38.99, or direct from Granta for \u00a36.99 or free: Guardian readers can subscribe to Granta for just \u00a321.95 (50% off), and get Shrinks free.

  "<p><strong> On Writing: A Memoir</strong></p> <p> Stephen King</p> <p> 256pp, Hodder</p> <p> \u00a316.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000094444,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p>'I like to get 10 pages a day, which amounts to 2,000 words,\" says Stephen King in his new memoir, On Writing. \"That's 180,000 words over a three-month span, a goodish length for a book.\" When he's working on a book, which is most of the time, he writes every day of the year, and that \"includes Christmas, the Fourth, and my birthday\". </p> <p>King is a not a writer, in the usual sense; he's an industry. According to Forbes, he makes in excess of $50,000,000 a year (and I didn't accidentally add a few zeros). It all began in 1974 with his first novel Carrie, about a teenage girl with supernatural powers. Some 30 novels and half a dozen story collections later, the man has never looked back, pounding out blockbusters in a way that redefines the word. Not since Dickens has a writer had so many readers - I confess to being one of them - by the throat. Much of his fiction has, of course, been turned into films. As if this weren't enough, King has also written five novels under the name of Richard Bachman and spun out nearly a dozen screenplays or teleplays. On top of which, he's a nice guy. </p> <p>The niceness comes through in his books, encoded in the voice itself: a loud but down-to-earth, friendly and innocent voice that might be America (or America's vision of itself) talking. The fact is, King has got more of postwar America into his fiction than almost any other writer now at work. That he has chosen to write in a particular genre - horror - has, unquestionably, worked against his critical reputation. Perhaps rightly, critics have wondered about his seriousness. The novels are terribly uneven, and even the best of them - The Shining, Pet Sematary, Dolores Claiborne, The Green Mile, Bag of Bones - tend to puff and wheeze after a while like an overweight man on a treadmill. Only his most recent novel, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, is tautly written. Nevertheless, King's imagination is vast. He knows how to engage the deepest sympathies of his readers, and they have rewarded him handsomely. </p> <p>Lately, King has been on the literary equivalent of a rampage. Bag of Bones was a big, distorted yet wonderfully entertaining novel that rode high on the bestseller lists in 1998. Hard on the heels of that success came a fine collection of stories, Hearts in Atlantis (1999). That same year, he also published The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon - a chilling, often beautiful novel about a young girl lost in the woods. For almost the first time, reviewers sat up respectfully, noting the depth and shapeliness of this work. One could no longer dismiss King as just another bad writer proffering cheap thrills to the multitudes. </p> <p>That same year, he brought out his first electronic book, Riding the Bullet. This novella was the world's first mass-market e-book, released through his conventional publisher, Scribner. Half a million downloads later, the publishing industry had to face up to something new under the sun. Soon the idea occurred to King that he might try e-publishing without a conventional publisher in the background. He would simply post a book on his website and request a dollar from anybody who downloaded it. Instead of writing something fresh, however, he rooted through his bottom drawer and found a long-abandoned piece of fiction called The Plant. It's a revenge fantasy about a frustrated author who sends a man-eating vine to devour his publishers. \"My friends,\" King wrote on his website (<a href=\"http://www.stephenking.com\">www.stephenking.com</a>), \"we have the chance to become Big Publishing's worst nightmare.\" Although not as successful as Riding the Bullet, the new work did well enough to please King. (For the record, I sent him a dollar.) </p> <p>Now comes On Writing: A Memoir. It is part biography, part collection of tips for the aspiring writer. In the final chapters, King tells, in graphic detail, the story of his recent accident. In June 1999 he was near his home in Maine, taking his usual four-mile stroll along a rural route. Unexpectedly, a blue Dodge minivan lurched over the hilltop, totally out of control. It was driven by a local man called Bryan Smith. King notes, casually: \"Smith wasn't looking at the road on the afternoon our lives came together because his rottweiler had jumped from the very rear of his van into the backseat area, where there was an Igloo cooler with some meat stored inside.\" Smith thought at first that he had hit \"a small deer\". </p> <p>It was King he hit. After bouncing off the windscreen, the author found himself at the side of the road with his lap turned the wrong way. One of his legs was broken in nine places, \"like so many marbles in a sock\", as his surgeon later explained. He had a collapsed lung and lacerations on his scalp. </p> <p>His devoted wife Tabitha (herself a novelist) stayed by him through several agonising weeks during which it was not clear whether King would ever walk again. His three grown children - Joe, Naomi and Owen - were by his side as well. King's gratitude shines through this memoir. One comes away from it liking King a great deal and admiring his family. </p> <p>Understanding her husband's compulsion to write, Tabitha established the wheelchaired King at a makeshift desk in a hallway of their rambling Victorian house only five weeks after the accident. That King could possibly summon the will to work in this situation is nothing less than astounding. He wrote a little at first, then a lot. Soon, it was business as usual: the author as locomotive, charging down the tracks of narrative, rock music blaring in the background. The pages gathered on his desk. In the 15 or so months since his accident, he has poured out the e-novella, Riding the Bullet, most of a teleplay in six hour-long parts for American television, and a 900-page novel, Dreamcatcher. Oh, yes, and he added the memoir of his accident to a book about the craft of writing that he'd already finished. </p> <p>King has nothing much to say about writing that isn't obvious. \"In my view, stories and novels consist of three parts,\" he explains with professorial solemnity: \"narration, description, and dialogue.\" He warns us: \"The adverb is not your friend.\" He advises writing behind a closed door: \"It is your way of telling the world and yourself that you mean business; you have made a serious commitment to write and intend to walk the walk as well as talk the talk.\" Oh dear. King is infinitely better at writing than talking about writing, though fans will doubtless find moments of interest here, especially when he talks about his own extraordinary writing habits. </p> <p>The best part of the book remains his account of how writing - and the primitive urge to write - saved his life after the accident. It's a bizarre and absorbing story, told brilliantly by one of the great storytellers of our time. One only hopes he lives to write many more books, however uneven. I would not begrudge him a single item on his bibliography. He is, after all, the King. </p> <p> \u0095 Jay Parini's novels include The Last Station and Benjamin's Crossing.</p>",
  "<p> The magical worlds of myth and fairy tale offer solace for both rejected child and adult misfit. Here weirdo can become hero, and eccentricity is recast as a special gift. For the terrifyingly intellectual Sibylla of Helen DeWitt's <strong> The Last Samurai </strong> (Chatto, \u00a316.99), the worst crime imaginable is boredom. It is to divert her ennui that she finds herself making love to a writer she meets at a party. From this union springs Ludo, enfant terrible. Cast in the same mould as his mother, he reads Homer at three and Japanese at five. Flat broke, they ride the Circle Line all day to keep warm while Sibylla answers Ludo's constant questions. She refuses, however, to reveal the identity of his father, instead playing him Seven Samurai on a video loop to provide an appropriate male role model. </p> <p>DeWitt has intelligence, wit and unusual stylistic bravery. However, she distances the reader with lengthy asides (not to mention passages in Greek and Japanese), seeming more interested in her writerly preoccupations than in allowing Ludo to become the hero of his own highly original story. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000093394,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p>In Karen Bender's <strong> Like Normal People </strong> (Picador, \u00a39.99), 45-year-old Lena is trapped in an eternal childhood.

In fact, it tends to prove the opposite. Publishers are meeting a demand for literature on the Nazi era. The demand exists because this subject grips the imagination and raises issues that are felt to be important and relevant. </p> <p>We are still dealing with the legacies of Nazism. Even more disturbing, as Gitta Sereny notes in the pessimistic conclusion to her extraordinary reflections, is that the syndrome once thought unique to Germany is spreading. Xenophobia, racism and moral corruption have taken a ghastly toll in Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Despite half a century of education and enlightenment, nowhere in Europe is free of the brutality and hatred that was supposed to have been vanquished in 1945. It is no wonder that the book-buying public is queuing up to read anything that might furnish answers to the question that has haunted Sereny's wartime generation: \"What leads human beings so often and readily to embrace violence and amorality?\" </p> <p>Many early efforts to explain the case of National Socialism were flawed by the absence of crucial documentation. The discovery of new material and fresh witnesses is but one reason for the late flowering of Holocaust studies, exemplified by Christopher Browning's superbly lucid essays. Browning has focused on the development of Nazi policy towards the Jews, in particular when and how the key decisions were made. In his latest volume he assimilates into his own deep research innovative studies by a new wave of German historians. </p> <p>Although he rejects some of the more radical interpretations that argue that the Europe-wide genocide against the Jews only coalesced in spring 1942, Browning maintains that it was not until October 1941 that the Nazi leadership resolved to annihilate Europe's Jewish population. They arrived at this point not as a result of long-term plans, but because other non-lethal expedients to get rid of the Jews had failed. Mass murder may have been latent within their aspirations in 1939 to banish Jews to a reservation in Poland, their hopes of using Madagascar as a dumping ground in 1940 or their dream of driving Jews across the Urals in 1941, but extermination was not then a fully fledged policy and they had no means to carry it out. </p> <p>If it was not inevitable, annihilation was conceivable because within the Nazi machine a consensus about what to do with the Jews already existed. In 1939-40, the Nazis had already engaged in massive transfers of population in Poland that included the savage eviction of Jews. The regime had previously crossed the threshold into criminality and mass murder when Hitler authorised the murder of physically and mentally disabled Germans in September 1939. The readiness to deal with the Jews in the harshest way now met with the availability of expertise in killing on a huge scale. Lower-level initiatives - what Ian Kershaw calls \"local genocides\" - were joined up by central direction into the \"Final Solution\". </p> <p>By now knowledge about the mass shootings of entire Jewish communities in the Soviet Union was percolating back into the Reich. Before long, there was information about the use of gas chambers in \"the East\". Yet there was never an adverse public reaction. The fate of the Jews barely figured in the motives of the military and conservative opposition to Hitler. Passivity on this issue can be seen as the result of acceptance, indifference or intimidation. This range of explanations delineates one of the most significant new debates about the Third Reich. </p> <p>Two historians, Eric Johnson and Robert Gellately, have used new documentation on the activity of the Gestapo to demonstrate that it was a small force that relied on denunciations to be effective. Nazi Germany, they say, was not a police state full of cowed citizens. Terror was applied selectively to unpopular groups such as communists, Jews, Romanies, gays and the \"workshy\", whose terrible fate was widely considered to be well deserved. Hitler and his subordinates were zealous at building support for the regime and strived not to alienate the general population. Terror was calibrated to public opinion rather than the other way around. </p> <p>Michael Burleigh will have none of this. In a major work that crackles with ideas and indignation he revives the model of totalitarianism, popular in the 1950s and 1960s, to explain how the Third Reich worked. National Socialists systematically subverted the rule of law, turning it from an instrument to protect the individual into a device to foster the national-racial community. As law was racialised and the excluded rendered vulnerable, \"the skeins that make up civilised society were brushed aside\". In Hitler's Germany, \"human spontaneity gave way to calculation\". </p> <p>Yet this represents only half of Burleigh's analytical apparatus. He also deploys to great effect the idea that National Socialism was a political religion, with Hitler posing as the messiah offering redemption to a fallen nation. Nazi rallies aped religious events. The party had its martyrs, its liturgy and its bowdlerised saints' days. Domestic policy was directed towards cultivating the myth of a chosen community destined to save mankind from the Jewish-Bolshevik antichrist. This is brilliant stuff, but Burleigh succeeds so well in describing the co-option and enchantment of the Germans that he undermines his own case for the rule of fear. </p> <p>To Gitta Sereny, the explanation of how people engage or connive in mass murder and possess the capacity to block it out either in the present or in memory \"lies in a personal and human rather than a theoretical or intellectual realm\". Whichever, it remains territory that has barely been explored. Until we know more - or until the killing stops - we need the \"Holocaust industry\". </p> <p> \u0095 David Cesarani is the author of The Final Solution.

  "Zimbabwe's opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, has warned of a popular uprising against the man he calls the Milosevic of Africa - President Robert Mugabe - if the government carries out its threat to arrest him for treason on his return home this weekend. <p>Mr Tsvangirai was accused of treason when he called for the violent overthrow of Mr Mugabe if he did not swiftly resign as president. But, speaking in Johannesburg, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said his detention would provoke a revolution. </p> <p>\"The mood of the people is so tense that I will not be responsible for the reactions of the people. We have given Mugabe a warning. It is clear. Listen to the people. The current mood in the country is uncompromising. A similar situation [to Yugoslavia] cannot be avoided,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We must stop Africa's Milosevic. There's no difference between the situation in Yugoslavia and the situation in Zimbabwe. There are parallels. [Mugabe] has committed genocide against a minority, rigged elections, ignored the rule of law and created a state which is internationally isolated.\"</p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai made the threat that earned him the prospect of arrest at a rally a week ago to mark the first anniversary of the MDC, which came within a whisker of defeating Zanu-PF in June's parliamentary elections. </p> <p>\"What we want to tell Mugabe today is to please go peacefully. If you don't want to go, we will remove you violently,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Mugabe later told a meeting of his party's central committee that the British government was working with the MDC to create unrest in the cities, \"in the hope that a Zanu-PF government will capitulate or fall in violent circumstances\". </p> <p>The day after his speech, Mr Tsvangirai left on a scheduled trip to Europe and South Africa. He was due to fly back to Harare on Tuesday but delayed his return after various government ministers called for his arrest. </p> <p>The speaker of parliament demanded his detention and prosecution for treason. The police described the \"threat of violence\" as unlawful and said they were prepared to act. </p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai said he had not intended to use the word \"violently\" and meant \"unceremoniously\", and that there was no legitimate reason to arrest him for his comments. </p> <p>\"It was undiplomatic, I must say, but it certainly wasn't treason,\" he said. \"The law cannot be applied selectively; one law for the MDC and another for Zanu-PF. There have been instances of people threatening to use weapons of war and they have not been arrested.\" </p> <p>More than 30 people have died in politically related violence in recent months, either during the occupation of white-owned farms or in attacks on MDC supporters. But there have been no arrests. </p> <p>Ominously, one of Mr Mugabe's old-guard supporters, Nathan Shamuyarira, warned that the ruling party would be more than a match for any uprising. </p> <p>\"The area of violence is an area where Zanu-PF has a very strong, long and successful history,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai said Zimbabwe could not afford another two years of Mr Mugabe until the next presidential election. </p> <p>\"I understand he still thinks he has more to contribute to Zimbabwe. That state of mind is delusionary. What he is involved in is the tactics of survival, not a strategy for the survival of the country.\" </p> <p>But he said that if Zimbabweans wanted change, they should learn from the example of Belgrade and not expect others to do it for them. </p> <p>\"You cannot watch a situation where things collapse in your hands and you expect a miracle to come from somewhere,\" he said. </p> <p>The government remains defiant. On Thursday the police shut down Zimbabwe's first independent radio station, less than a week after it went on air, in defiance of a supreme court ruling. The high court has ordered the chief of police and his deputy to appear in court on Monday to explain why they should not be jailed for contempt. The government accused Britain of \"making threats\" to try to stop the move against the radio station. </p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai said this was further evidence of Mr Mugabe's desperation. </p> <p>\"It is an illustration of a government that's intolerant of opposing views,\" he said. \"It does not want the space for any mouthpiece other than that which supports Zanu-PF views.\"</p>",
  "The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, has asked the security council to approve the prosecution of child soldiers accused of murder, mutilation and rape in Sierra Leone. <p>But Unicef and other child-welfare groups have condemned the plan to put them in front of an international court, saying that no matter what the crimes of juvenile fighters, they are as much victims as perpetrators. </p> <p>There are estimated to be more than 5,000 child soldiers in Sierra Leone, many of them technically open to criminal charges. Children as young as eight have been implicated in killings, rapes and hacking limbs from other children and adults. Most were fighting for the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) or the former military government's army. </p> <p>To placate the critics, it is suggested that sentences for juveniles convicted of atrocities should be limited to terms in a rehabilitation centre or in community service. No one under the age of 15 will be tried. The final decision on whether to adopt the proposal lies with the security council. </p> <p>Children's rights groups such as Unicef are lobbying the big powers to reject the plan by arguing that many child soldiers are themselves victims because they were abducted, forcibly fed powerful drug concoctions of cocaine or heroin, and pushed into battle. Unicef warns that putting them on trial would risk \"making these children a victim a second time\".</p> <p> The London-based Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, which includes Amnesty International, Save the Children and Human Rights Watch, said the priority should be to prosecute those who recruit children as soldiers, rather than the juvenile fighters themselves. </p> <p>\"There is no doubt that children have participated in some of the most brutal acts in Sierra Leone,\" the coalition's chairwoman, Jo Becker, said. \"However, many of these children were forced to commit atrocities under threat of death, and often given drugs and alcohol to desensitise them to violence.\"</p> <p> But many Sierra Leoneans do not regard drunken and drugged teenagers armed with machetes as children. The government wanted anyone guilty of atrocities put on trial, no matter what age. It was UN lawyers who argued for a cut-off age of 15. </p> <p>The tribunal, agreed with the Sierra Leonean government last month, will be the first modern international court to sit in the country where the crimes were committed. The trials in Freetown will be heard by a mixture of local and foreign judges, who will apply national or international law according to the charges. </p> <p>Its jurisdiction will cover murder, torture, rape, sexual slavery, mutilation, hostage-taking, pillage and attacks on civilians. The primary target is the RUF's leadership, particularly its founder, Foday Sankoh, who was captured in May.</p> <p> But the prospect of including the trial of children will increase pressure for it to focus also on others guilty of war crimes, particularly the former military ruler Johnny Paul Koroma and his army, which is now loyal to the government. </p> <p>Mr Koroma was at one time an ally of the RUF, most notoriously during the rebel attack on Freetown in January last year, when hundreds of people had their arms hacked off, including a child just a few months old, and thousands of young boys and girls were abducted to be used as fighters or sex slaves. </p> <p>If those who recruited child fighters are also put on trial, it could open the way for charges against members of the government army.</p>",
  "Kenneth Clarke thinks they are in fashion again and Charles Kennedy courts them. From Churchill to Heath they were the Tories who mattered - and even in bleaker times they were members of the high command. When John Major got into a fix he sometimes claimed to be one of them. Now they are kings over the water - toasted by ever diminishing cliques within their own party, but acclaimed in wider, saner society. They both tease and observe the stale decencies of party loyalty as they wait for the all-consuming Europhobic jihad to end.

They were also to be seduced into political passivity by the manipulative Disraelian rhetoric of the nation - a new royalism and a new imperialism. </p> <p>Disraeli's \"young England\" was really very old and hierarchical, a mock-medieval England of useful myths packaged for the credulous in campery's pink ribbons. Suffering would be alleviated but its structural causes retained. Shaftesbury - another Tory liberal titan - pioneered legislation on working conditions but did so in a thoroughly moralising way. The point about lice was that they produced vice and grime led to crime. Dirt was dangerous because it threatened the fabric of order. The more you change, the more you keep. </p> <p>One Nation Toryism was successful in England for a long time and was in its way quite a sophisticated construct. It said that capitalism was necessary but caused suffering. Too much obvious suffering would kill the goose that laid the egg. Allow the Tories then to bandage the wounds so that the factory can still open in time. </p> <p>The abrasive Thatcherite displacement of all this has made for some roseate retrospective views. The reality is that One Nationism was, and is, as manipulative as any form of Toryism. It has been especially pernicious in pandering to one of the worst national failings - the readiness to be patronised. </p> <p>Patriotism as a big-tent refuge from class consciousness was a One Nation construct. But flexibility and pragmatism have also been important buzzwords in that tradition and especially useful for those with careers to make. Like all successful bits of the political lexicon, \"One Nation\" can mean different things to different people - Enoch Powell and Rab Butler both joined up when the tendency became a formal group. The \"property-owning democracy\" started as a One Nation phrase in the 50s and was easily adapted to the \"popular capitalism\" of the 80s. </p> <p>When it comes to contemporary practitioners, however, there is a gap between the record and the rhetoric which is striking even by politicians' standards. Kenneth Clarke is the only Tory who has both substance and popularity. He wins, rightly, all the plaudits for the consistency and strength of his Europeanism. But who now remembers that the Birmingham breezer was as much of a Tory bruiser as the rest of them as health and education secretary? He presided over the disastrously managerial first phase of the health reforms, enjoyed his tussles with the nurses and castigated teaching unions with uninhibited zeal as a Woodhead before his time. </p> <p>One Nation could happily turn Thatcherite in the 80s and 90s for two reasons. First, it was under-resourced intellectually. Readers of Michael Heseltine's recent autobiography will be rewarded by a monument to windy generality. But the more important reason is the \"wetness\" of One Nation Tories.</p> <p>Was there ever a group of politicians (before the Major cabinet) which clung to office with such desperation and would undergo whichever loyalty test was going? Press the backtrack button and see William Waldegrave's fastidious features as he parrots the language of \"inputs\" and \"outputs\" in the health service. Look at civilised, scholarly Robert Jackson, happily embarked on the nationalisation of the universities as minister of higher education. </p> <p> Then there are the Gilmours, the Priors and the Walkers. They, of course, \"fought in cabinet\" but still collectively subscribed to the economic mismanagement of 1979-82: that era of crazed monetarism from which, ironically, Thatcher had to be rescued by the monetarist Alan Walters. Being a One Nation man means never saying \"I resign\". The only one of any consequence to do so, Michael Heseltine, has never ceased to regret that moment of glory in the lens and of striding splendour in Downing Street. Margaret Thatcher knew her men. </p> <p>When it comes to justification of rule from Dagenham (two stops beyond Barking), One Nationism relies on self-serving stereotypes of class and sex. We were all men and she was a woman. What's more we were gents who knew how to treat a lady - but not this particular specimen. Tory sceptics might have been wrong and boring, but at least some of them were brave in a bad cause. </p> <p>One Nation's most important failure has been Europe, an issue which it has insistently presented as a narrowly economic one. The Heath negotiations of 1970-72 started when the One Nation prime minister was still in the grip of Selsdon Man-mania. That manifesto \"avant la Thatcher\" talked of rolling back the state, setting the people free and downsizing everything in sight. Thirty years ago, One Nation was already a corpse. </p> <p>Europe was part of Heathco's managerialist and business plan. The failure to present the wider political and constitutional question left the project ill-equipped to negotiate the choppier waters of the 90s. Even now Tory Euro-philiacs will present the euro's virtues as Thatcherite ones of fiscal discipline born out of popular suffering. Our cold bath will, apparently, suit them too. </p> <p>It is idle to expect leadership from a group now bypassed by events, from those who content themselves with coded statements while bound by an antediluvian tribal ethic. When the history of One Nation is written, posterity will wonder and reflect on the strange potency of cheap phrases. This was a deserved burial. </p> <p> Hywel Williams is the author of Guilty Men: Conservative Decline and Fall 1992-97 (Aurum Press). </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Doctors were yesterday given the go-ahead to withdraw artificial feeding from two patients in a state of \"living death\", after England's senior family judge ruled that the move would not infringe their right to life. <p>The case went before Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, head of the high court's family division, to test the effect of the new Human Rights Act on doctors' right to withdraw artificial feeding in patients' best interests. </p> <p>The House of Lords ruled in 1993, in the case of the Hillsborough survivor Tony Bland, that doctors could withdraw tube feeding from patients who were in a permanent vegetative state (PVS), because it conferred no benefit on them. </p> <p>Since then, around 20 such patients have been allowed to die, but the law had to be reconsidered in the light of the Human Rights Act. </p> <p>The act, which came into force last Monday, makes the European convention on human rights part of UK law. The convention places a positive obligation on the state to safeguard life. </p> <p>Dame Elizabeth made declarations that doctors could lawfully withdraw treatment from the two women, who are both in PVS, after hearing evidence and submissions over two days from representatives of the two NHS trusts involved and the official solicitor on behalf of the patients. </p> <p>In both cases, she said the two women, identified only as Ms H, 36, and Mrs M, 49, lacked the capacity to make decisions about their future medical treatment. She said it was not in their best interests to continue artificial nutrition and hydration. </p> <p>Both women's families want them to be allowed to die. Mrs M has been vegetative for three years after an anaesthetic mishap during a gynaecological operation overseas. Ms H, who suffers from severe epilepsy, had a heart attack while in hospital last January, depriving her brain of oxygen. Two weeks ago her feeding tube became blocked and doctors were unable to unblock it. </p> <p>The hospital trust treating Ms H said in a statement: \"The decision today represents a further stage in what has been, and continues to be, a difficult and very sad time for everyone involved in this tragic case. </p> <p>\"The application was made only after a very thorough and rigorous process of seeking independent medical opinion, and discussion with the family.\" </p> <p>The trust looking after Mrs M said: \"It is the wish of the family and those responsible for the medical and nursing care of this patient that she is permitted to end her life peacefully and with dignity.\" </p> <p>Lawyers for the trusts and the patients told Dame Elizabeth that both sides agreed that the principles laid down by the House of Lords in the Bland case complied with the European convention. </p> <p>John Grace QC, for the trusts, both of which are in the north of England, said that the patients were \"victims\" of medical technology that did not exist when the human rights convention was drawn up in 1950. But the principles established in the Bland case amounted to \"an adequate protection\" under the convention's right-to-life provisions.</p>",
  "A high court judge yesterday found Punch magazine guilty of contempt for publishing an article by the former MI5 officer David Shayler about the IRA's bombing campaign, although he found no evidence it had damaged national security. <p>Mr Justice Silber said the article breached a 1997 injunction barring newspapers from publishing information disclosed by Mr Shayler even though government lawyers admitted it had often been ignored. </p> <p>The judge said the injunction even covered information which had already been published - a ruling which appears to contradict a law lords ruling on Spycatcher, the memoirs of the former MI5 officer Peter Wright, which the Thatcher government failed to suppress. </p> <p>\"The purpose of the injunction is not to protect national security,\" the judge said. Punch was guilty of undermining the administration of justice. The attorney general had a right to be protected by the courts. </p> <p>That, said the judge, overruled the right of freedom of expression guaranteed under article 10 of the European convention on human rights, incorporated in the Human Rights Act which came into force in England on Monday. </p> <p>David Price, solicitor advocate for Punch, challenged the judgment. He told Mr Justice Silber that government lawyers had made it clear to James Steen, the editor of Punch, before publication that the injunction was to protect national security. \"There was no evidence the article damaged national security,\" he said. </p> <p>\"My main disappointment,\" Mr Price said after the hearing, \"is that the government had previously distinguished between the the old world of Spycatcher and the new world of New Labour.\" </p> <p>In the Punch article, published in July and headed \"MI5 could have stopped the bomb going off\", Mr Shayler gave details of the activities of MI5, GCHQ and the police special branch before the IRA bombed Bishopsgate in the City of London in 1993. The article referred to \"unarmed\" surveillance operations and operational mistakes by the security and intelligence agencies. </p> <p>Sean Martin, the Treasury solicitor responsible for the Shayler case, earlier admitted to Mr Justice Silber that \"very large amounts\" of material from Mr Shayler had already been published. Mr Shayler had himself written 10 articles for Punch without the attorney general taking action. They included information obtained by MI5 before the bombing of the Israeli embassy in 1994 and the fact that MI5 had a personal file on Mark Thomas, the leftwing comedian. </p> <p>Mr Justice Silber gave Punch leave to appeal.</p>",
  "Even as Vojislav Kostunica was being annointed in office yesterday, he sounded a nationalist warning which served as a reminder to the rest of the world that the new Yugoslavia will not rush into the embrace of western liberalism. <p>\"I am deeply convinced that this is the last time that representatives of the international community and friendly countries like the Russian federation try to resolve our internal disputes,\" the 56-year-old constitutional lawyer said. </p> <p>It was a typically tough uncompromising remark from a man who was unknown outside Yugoslavia a year ago. </p> <p>Mr Kostunica is, first and foremost, a purist. He wears plain dark suits, his manner is almost deliberately uncharismatic, he drives around Belgrade in a battered old Yugo, and his politics are distilled Serbian nationalism. </p> <p>This is no urbane cosmopolitan liberal eager to embrace the west. This is a man who accused Slobodan Milosevic of treason for signing the Bosnian, and then the Kosovo, peace deals. He has had warm words in the past for the indicted Bosnian Serb war criminal, Radovan Karadzic. </p> <p>He went to Kosovo two years ago to show his support for the Serb cause and was photographed brandishing an AK47 machine gun alongside nationalist militants. And yesterday, he sounded an almost xenophobic note. </p> <p>But unlike Mr Milosevic and his fellow Serbian warlords, Mr Kostunica is as devout a democrat as he is a nationalist. Along with other nationalist academics, he was sacked from his university post by the Tito regime; unlike most, he refused to take his job back in 1989 when Mr Milosevic took power in Serbia. </p> <p>He was born in the Serbian heartland, in the village of Kostunici. When he returned there during the campaign, he gave a wistful speech steeped in the mysticism which lies at the core of the everyman nationalism which flourishes across the Serbian plains. </p> <p>It is a romantic backward-looking nationalism which still mourns the defeat in 1389 by the Turks. Mr Kostunica has suggested the adoption of an old national anthem written at the height of a 19th century upswelling of nationalism. </p> <p>This is the sort of thing which brings tears to Serbian eyes, but it does not answer the question of how he will square his vows to defend Serb interests in Bosnia, Kosovo and Montenegro with his commitment to non-violence and the rule of law. He pledges to lay the gun aside (he claims the AK47 in the 1998 photograph was put into his hands). </p> <p>Nor does his misty-eyed version of the Serb cause provide guidance over how he will negotiate Yugoslavia's re-entry into the international community. What if the price of entry is surrendering war criminals? </p> <p>He has said he would not hand Mr Milosevic over to the war crimes tribunal in the Hague, a court he calls \"an instrument of American policy\". He insists he wants to establish a Yugoslav \"truth commission\" to thrash out the crimes of the past eight years in a domestic arena. That will not be enough for the US or Britain, but it would probably be acceptable to Russia and France. Mr Kostunica may prove more capable than Mr Milosevic in splitting the west. </p> <p>As far as Kosovo and Montenegro are concerned, he will probably call off the thugs the old regime sent to destabilise them. He has shown himself to be flexible over Kosovo, remarking: \"Those who think Serbia cannot exist as a nation without Kosovo are wrong.\" Meanwhile, with a democratic government in Belgrade, Montenegro may rein in its drive to full independence. </p> <p>That would temporarily defuse a potentially explosive issue, but there remain many others. Each step he must take threatens to fracture his 18-party coalition made up of everything from western-style liberals to frothing-at-the-mouth irredentists.</p>",
  "It seemed plain common sense to pin the contract-style shooting of Alan Decabral on Kenneth Noye, the man he helped to put in jail. Despite being behind bars, Noye is a still a revered figure in the underworld: during his criminal career, time and again he was one step ahead of the police - and even had some of them on his payroll. <p>But yesterday as Kent detectives started digging into the background of Mr Decabral, a 40-year-old Kent businessman, they found a \"shadowy\" past suggesting he had a long list of enemies who might have wanted to kill him.</p> <p>Mr Decabral, a father of three, was sitting in the front passenger seat of his son's Peugot 205 in a retail park in Ashford, Kent, on Thursday lunchtime when he was shot in the head by a hitman.</p> <p>Witnesses heard a loud bang before seeing a man in his 20s running away. Mr Decabral's son, who had been shopping in the Halford's store, rushed out to find his father slumped dead over the dashboard with blood pouring from a bullet wound.</p> <p><b> Single shot</b><br> </p> <p> Detective chief inspector Bob Nelson, of Kent police,said it was highly unlikely the victim spotted his killer approaching: \"It was all over very quickly and the gunman was seen sprinting away from the scene. He fired a single shot through an open passenger window hitting his victim in the side of the head,\" Mr Nelson said.</p> <p>\"We are still waiting for confirmation of the type of weapon used but we believe it could have been a self-loading pistol, revolver or rifle.\"</p> <p>Mr Decabral had talked of death threats and of living in fear since his testimony helped to jail Noye for the 1996 road rage murder of Stephen Cameron. He described in detail to the Old Bailey jury how the sun glinted off the blade of Noye's knife.</p> <p>Yesterday police teams scoured Mr Decabral's \u00a3250,000 semi-detached home in Pluckley, eight miles from Ashford.</p> <p>Mr Decabral was well-known locally. Richard Gray, landlord of his local pub, the Blacksmiths Arms, said Mr Decabral used to drink at his pub but was banned more than a year ago for arguing with another customer.</p> <p>\"He was well-known for having a shady past and didn't make any secret of the fact that most of his friends were in prison. I think everyone round here thought he was a pretty shady character, although people were shocked when they heard he had been murdered.</p> <p>\"I was forced to ban him from my pub after he started arguing with another customer. It was over something trivial like a spilled beer but Mr Decabral turned nasty and it upset some of my other customers. I told him he was not welcome anymore.\"</p> <p>Police raided Mr Decabral's home in the summer. He pleaded guilty to possessing a prohibited weapon and 38mg of cocaine.</p> <p>As yet, detectives are unsure whether Mr Decabral's murder was carried out by friends of Noye or whether his own business dealings had created enemies which may have been responsible for his death.</p> <p>\"The more we delve into his past, the more complicated it gets,\" a police source said. \"We raided his home in July. We don't normally carry out that scale of operation without having very good reasons, although we failed to find anything in Mr Decabral's case.</p> <p>\"But he led a very tangled life both in his private and business affairs, which could have created enemies who wanted him out of the way. It would be wrong to just focus on a possible Noye connection in relation to his death.\"</p> <p>More emerged yesterday, casting doubt on claims by Mr Decabral that he had received death threats. Mr Decabral, who had dealt in cars and vintage guns, said three bullets had been pushed through his letterbox before testifying.</p> <p><b> Noye appeal</b><br> </p> <p> Detective Chief Inspector Bob Nelson dismissed suggestions that the murder victim had been under police protection since giving evidence against Noye at his Old Bailey trial.</p> <p>\"Mr Decabral was offered police protection but refused it. He was not living in a police safe house. It was a private address.\"</p> <p>Mr Nelson also stressed that as far as police were concerned Mr Decabral had not received death threats prior to appearing at Noye's trial.</p> <p>\"We have spoken to his close friends and family and they have failed to support the story that there were any threats at all.\"</p> <p>Noye's solicitor, Henry Milner, confirmed that his client had lodged an ap peal against his murder conviction. If Noye had ordered the hit, it would amount to judicial suicide, almost certainly blowing any chance of the appeal succeeding.</p> <p>Police sources confirmed that officers planned to interview Noye in the high security category A unit of Whitemoor Prison in Cambridgeshire.</p> <p>Other witnesses in the Noye trial were last night being contacted by police and a review was being carried out of their protection.</p> <p>Danielle Cable, the fiancee of Stephen Cameron, who was with him when he was stabbed by Noye, is believed the have been contacted by police.</p> <p>After the trial, she was given a new identity and moved hundreds of miles away from her Kent home.</p> <p>Her 65-year-old grandmother, Joan Panes, from Orpington, Kent, has not been able to see her in two years. Yesterday Mrs Panes said: \"Although Danielle has been given a new identity, she is petrified that someone will still come after her and find her. She really does fear for her life.\"</p> <p>Author Wensley Clarkson, who wrote a book about Noye, says the area of Kent where the killing took place is home to a host of millionaire gangsters. He said that dozens of drug barons and others who have made millions from crime live in the area, where Noye himself once lived.</p>",
  "The ban on stag hunting will continue on National Trust lands, the organisation's ruling council has decided after considering the Burns report on hunting. <p>The decision ends the last hope of the deer hunts in the West Country to overturn the trust's ban, introduced in 1997 after an earlier report had condemned the sport as cruel. </p> <p>Since then the hunters have taken on the trust in a protracted high court battle and commissioned their own study to try to show that the science in the original Bateson report on cruelty was flawed. </p> <p>Each time the trust has remained unmoved, but its council said in January that it would keep an open mind on new evidence and would consider the government-commissioned Burns report. </p> <p>This report looked at the social, economic, conservation and animal welfare aspects of a ban on hunting with hounds, but the trust decided yesterday that the report did not alter the basis on which it had developed its field sports policy. </p> <p>Stag hunting remains banned but other field sports including fox hunting, shooting and fishing can continue, unless the government bans them. </p> <p>In the statement the council said: \"The National Trust is very much aware of the importance of countryside traditions. </p> <p>\"It allows field sports to take place on its property where traditionally practised, providing they are within the law and are compatible with the trust's purposes, which include public access and the protection of rare animals and birds and fragile habitats. </p> <p>\"The trust is a charitable body, and as such cannot take a political position either for or against field sports.\" </p> <p>Relations with the stag hunting fraternity have continued to deteriorate since the ban, with allegations that the hunters have been trespassing on trust land. </p> <p>Ten days ago the master of the Quantock staghounds, Paddy Groves, was forced to apologise to the trust and give a written undertaking that the Quantock staghounds would not trespass in future. </p> <p>The apology followed a trespass at Shervage wood in Somerset on September 4, when the International Fund for Animal Welfare videoed the hunt and provided evidence that the Quantock staghounds had broken the ban. </p> <p>The trust consulted its lawyers and would have taken the hunt to court seeking an injunction to prevent another trespass if it had not received an apology and an undertaking it would not happen again. </p> <p>The trust said at the time: \"We have taken this firm and decisive action to protect the welfare of the red deer on our land.\" </p> <p>Yesterday a spokesman in London said the trust hoped that the battle over hunting was now entirely a matter for the government.</p>",
  "<p>A hospital consultant is being investigated by police over allegations of up to 10 cases of mercy killing, following an internal inquiry at the hospital where she works. </p> <p>The doctor, who has not been named, has been suspended from the Basildon hospital in Essex. </p> <p>The allegations relate to the overprescription of drugs. Up to 10 patients are thought to have been given lethal doses of pain killers. All the patients are thought to have been elderly and terminally ill. None was a child. </p> <p>Essex police said they \"are investigating allegations made against a doctor from the Basildon and Thurrock general hospitals NHS trust concerning inappropriate use of medicines on seriously ill patients. </p> <p>\"The police were called in by the trust following concerns raised by an internal investigation. The doctor is currently suspended.\" </p> <p>The hospital carried out an internal inquiry after a colleague raised concerns about the amount of painkillers the doctor had been prescribing. </p> <p>The case is likely to highlight again the difficult and emotive issues involved in treating people who are terminally ill and may be in severe pain. </p> <p>The British Medical Association has drawn up guidelines which bar doctors from euthanasia or from helping patients to end their lives, but there have been heated debates every time the issues have arisen. </p> <p>Two years ago, the BMA conference demanded that its leadership hold a major consultation exercise within the profession. Some doctors wanted to reserve the right to help their patients kill themselves, but the consensus was that it was neither safe nor consistent with a doctor's duty to heal and save life. </p> <p>The guidelines for doctors now state: \"The BMA recognises that some doctors, having exhausted all other possibilities for ensuring a patient's comfort, may see the deliberate termination of life as the only solution in an individual case. </p> <p>\"Nevertheless, the BMA maintains that in such circumstances, the doctor should be accountable to the law and to the General Medical Council and be obliged to defend such an action.\" </p> <p>Many doctors will admit privately that they have helped a patient who is in pain to die. Sometimes it may happen inadvertently. Giving a very high dose of painkillers to a terminally ill patient will block the pain, but may shorten the patient's life. </p> <p>One GP, David Moor, was acquitted of carrying out a mercy killing in May last year. He admitted giving an 85-year- old cancer patient, George Liddell, a large dose of diamorphine, but successfully argued that his intention had been to stop the pain, not to kill. </p> <p>He said after his acquittal: \"Given a situation like George Liddell I would take exactly the same decision, manage the whole harrowing experience in the same way, and walk out of the house with a clear conscience.\" </p> <p>The case became something of a cause celebre after Dr Moor was reported to have said he had helped 300 of his patients to die. He later denied the claim in court. In the end, the issue of euthanasia was not put on trial as some had hoped because of Dr Moor's insistence that death was coincidental. </p> <p>\"Doctors who treat dying patients to relieve their pain and suffering walk a tightrope to achieve this,\" the GP said.</p>",
  "<p>Essex health authorities waited more than six months before telling 5,000 patients by letter yesterday of a small risk that they might have been infected with HIV during treatment at dental surgeries in three of the county's main towns. </p> <p>Public health officials said they had decided against making an earlier announcement because they wanted first to mount \"a major look-back exercise\" to identify all the patients who had come into contact with the infected health worker over the previous 12 years. </p> <p>Paul Watson, director of public health for north Essex, said the operation to check rigorously through the relevant dental practice records was the biggest of its kind undertaken in Britain. </p> <p>The north Essex and south Essex authorities were told in March that a healthcare worker looking after patients at surgeries in Colchester, Clacton and Southend had tested positive for HIV. </p> <p>They said the person had stopped working immediately after the diagnosis, and they insisted that the risk of patients becoming infected with HIV was very small. </p> <p>No information is being disclosed about whether the individual was a man or woman, or a dentist, dental nurse, hygienist or anaesthetist. </p> <p>\"Had we made an announcement in March that would have caused a lot of worry to a huge number of people,\" Dr Watson said. </p> <p>\"We are expecting thousands of people to call our helpline, afraid that they might have been affected. Had we made an announcement in March that number could have run into millions and caused a lot of unnecessary panic.\" </p> <p>But the decision was causing concern among some local doctors. One said it was \"a complete breach of trust\", asserting that the public had the right to know immediately if they had been exposed to the virus. </p> <p>\"I would expect the authority to inform patients at the surgeries that they may be at risk immediately. By waiting this long, they are only going to cause more panic and concern,\" he said. </p> <p>A non-official source at north Essex health authority said: \"We have been overwhelmed by the number of calls. People are naturally very concerned.\" </p> <p>Dr Watson said the chances of patients being infected with HIV while they received treatment were \"minuscule, but we do feel that people should be informed and offered a confidential test if they want it\". </p> <p>In north Essex about 5,000 patients were notified by letters posted on Thursday. Helplines were set up offering counselling and the opportunity to take a simple saliva test for HIV. </p> <p>In south Essex nearly 100 people were notified and offered the same facilities. </p> <p>Defending the time taken to notify patients, Dr Watson said: \"It has taken this long to set up the exercise and search through records to find patients who might have come into contact with this worker.\" </p> <p>It was \"the biggest look-back exercise\" involving a health care worker with HIV. </p> <p>Dr Watson said there was nothing to suggest that the worker had not taken normal precautions against infecting patients, such as wearing rubber gloves. </p> <p>Bryan Harvey, chairman of the south Essex local dental committee, said any patient who had concerns about dental work should consult their dentist. </p> <p>\"The question will be asked, is it safe to go to the dentist? The answer is that it is. All healthcare workers in dental practice work to professional regulations and high standards of infection-control procedures. These are universal precautions. All patients are treated in the same way. </p> <p>\"In addition to the obvious measures, such as healthcare workers wearing gloves, there are infection control measures in place that patients do not see.\" </p> <p>Helen Maguire, an Essex consultant, said there had been no cases in the UK of HIV being passed on to a patient from a healthcare worker. But 15 years ago in the US six people had contracted the virus after direct contact with a dentist.</p>",
  "After the revolution, the real work begins. Having bombed and blasted Serbia during the Kosovo war, impoverished it with economic sanctions and isolated and divided it by all available means, western governments now bear a heavy responsibility in helping its people put their country back together again. Having succoured and shielded Slobodan Milosevic during Yugoslavia's years of fear, Russia, too, has a moral obligation to repair the damage. Institutions like the Council of Europe and the OSCE can also play a role in rebuilding a democratic, free and open civil society, in persuading Serbs that their future lies securely within the European community. <p>Foreign secretary Robin Cook was quick yesterday to offer reconstruction aid. The EU as a whole and the US have a duty to be generous in this respect. Most sanctions will be rescinded in the next few days; and Milosevic's successor, Vojislav Kostunica, has been invited to next week's EU summit in Biarritz. He should receive not merely the congratulations of Europe's leaders but funds and, for example, practical assistance in clearing the Danube and rebuilding bombed bridges. Mr Kostunica and the federal parliament will of course be the judges of what is right and proper in the way of aid. But if he asks for western help, he must be sure to get it. There should be no repeat of the Kosovo shambles last winter after the west failed to deliver swiftly on its Sarajevo summit promises. This week the Serbs finally found the courage to change. The rewards for that brave act of popular will must be immediate, tangible and persuasive. </p> <p>For just as the joy this week has at times been unconfined, the perils ahead are limitless. In deposing the hated Milosevic, the opposition lost the single issue that united it. Maintaining this inherently unstable alliance, retaining popular support and creating a consensus for much-needed, thorough institutional reform are challenges that may yet prove to be beyond Mr Kostunica's power. </p> <p>He has to contend with the old guard of Milosevic cronies and placemen and the tainted, undemocratic structures controlled by Milosevic's Socialist party. He faces, in parliament and beyond, the rump forces of a destructive ultra-nationalism that his own strong, patriotic credentials may not be enough to neutralise. He must win the backing, not merely the acquiescence of the vast security apparatus. And he must deal with the unavoidable questions of retribution and reconciliation in a society where justice and the law were debauched. Much baring of souls and past sins can be expected as the media casts off its chains and free speech returns. A South African-style truth commission might be a good start. For Serbia's self-inflicted wounds, let alone those inflicted on its neighbours, will not be easily healed, nor the thirst for revenge easily quenched. </p> <p>For a watching world, one key test of Serbia's rehabilitation will be its treatment of indicted war criminals like Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. Above all, Milosevic, the man who created and harboured them, must be made to answer for his crimes. In all such cases, there should be no deals, no amnesties. Another test will be future policy towards independence-minded Kosovo and Montenegro. Mr Kostunica opposes a further Yugoslav fragmentation; the west opposes the creation of yet more Balkan mini-states. But reintegration is deeply problematic. This is all part of the larger conundrum - how to make the nation whole again. Having reclaimed his country, Mr Kostunica must now find the means to resurrect it.</p>",

  "<p>Shares in beleagured computer games company Eidos suffered a further battering yesterday following the resignation of its finance chief and increased speculation that a takeover bid for the company is on the verge of collapse. </p> <p>The unexpected announcement that chief financial officer Jeremy Lewis had quit with immediate effect to \"pursue other interests\" has intensified a feeling among analysts that long-running takeover talks with Infogrames of France may end in deadlock.</p> <p>Shares in Eidos slumped 15% in early trading and later closed down 12.75p at 294.5p, around one-fifth of the year high of \u00a312.90p.</p> <p>Eidos and Infogrames have been arguing about the terms of a deal since June 20, when the French firm first indicated that it was interested in making an offer for Eidos.</p> <p>Mr Lewis' sudden departure and chief operating officer Mike McGarvey's admission that Eidos would now look for a finance chief with operational experience to help it through the slump in its busi ness led some analysts to suggest the deal was off, and that Eidos was preparing for life as an independent entity.</p> <p>Eidos sources insisted that former corporate financier Mr Lewis was not leaving because of anything \"sinister\" inside the company.</p> <p>\"The straightforward truth is that Jeremy has a deal-making background and came into the company when we were making acquisitions and our growth cycle was at a different stage,\" Mr McGarvey said. \"We will look for a more operationally focused finance director and focus inwards on controls, systems and overheads.\"</p> <p>Sources close to Eidos admitted that losing Mr Lewis in the middle of takeover talks was far from ideal and would add to negative sentiment over the company in the City.</p> <p>Eidos has been hit by successive profit warnings this year following falling sales of its Tombraider franchise and slowing demand for games as consumers waited for the introduction of new consoles.</p> <p>Its shares fell sharply again last month when Sony admitted to a shortfall in supply of its PlayStation 2.</p>",
  "<p>Fancy a bet? You, me and this coin. I'll toss it, you call heads or tails. If I win, you pay me \u00a3100. And then that's the end of it. It's just a one-off. Interested? Possibly? Well, you tell me how much you want me to cough up if you win. \u00a3100? More? Less? It's not a trick question. There is no right or wrong answer. It's all a matter of your risk appetite. One would expect a sequence of 50:50 flutters to even out over a period. But a one-off is something altogether different. Just how much do you need to shoot for to compensate for the gut-wrenching feeling on losing \u00a3100? </p> <p>Of course, your personal financial circumstances will be a key determinant of your answer. But this is not a simple, direct function of wealth. After all, the poorest people in the UK are often the heaviest players of the National Lottery, regardless of its outlandishly long odds. (Indeed, it is precisely because of its long odds that it lures the hard up.) However, on a straight toss of a coin, higher wealth will typically spell a greater willingness to embrace risk. </p> <p>Your risk appetite at any one moment will also depend on non-financial factors, such as which side of bed you got out of, whether the sun's shining or who you dined with last night. We've all experienced a rush of financial blood to the head that has puzzled or embarrassed us after the event. Even if it was to our advantage at the time. </p> <p>One of my colleagues, seeking further insight into the valuation mysteries of equity markets, this week posed this coin tossing question to 50 of our team at Old Mutual Securities. The answers ranged from \u00a350 to \u00a310,000, with \u00a3200 the most frequent reply. Apparently this is a typical result, which goes to show that stockbrokers have some regard for money. </p> <p>In the interest of fairness, I'll have to try and forget what I've learnt about our staff before the time comes to dish out their pay and rations at the end of the year. After all, I now know that one member of the team values \u00a3100 200 times more highly than another. I think I'll fish a coin from my pocket and seek out those prepared to take me on for less than \u00a3101 - my personal answer to the survey. The unwillingness of most people to take on a perfectly balanced bet goes some way to explaining why over time equities tend to produce higher investment returns than both bonds and cash. Investors need to compensate for the downside risk inherent in equities. By contrast, cash is as safe as the bank it is deposited in. Bonds are as secure as their central bank or government guarantee. </p> <p><strong> Slough of despair</strong><br> </p> <p> Over the course of the twentieth century US equities produced an annual return of 10.3%. Government bonds returned 4.7%. This is spookily consistent with the average desire to see a possible \u00a3200 win in return for a \u00a3100 risk on the toss of a coin. </p> <p>This year, unless investor sentiment changes dramatically in the coming weeks, equity returns will fail to match those from bonds. So far in 2001, equity returns in both the US and UK lag 9% behind bonds. Globally, the shortfall is 2%. </p> <p>The expectations of investors are typically formed by their most recent experiences. The future is assumed to be an extrapolation of the past , although different investors take different views of the time period over which the past should be measured. It is easy to see, then, how markets can work themselves into frenzies of excitement or sloughs of despair. </p> <p>In the first quarter of 2000 frenzy, not slough, was the order of the day. Now, the reverse is true. It is very clear which side of the bed investors, collectively, are getting out of day after day after day. </p> <p>Equity prices have fallen with no major change in the perception of background investment fundamentals. In these conditions, the expectation of future gains should have increased. However, investor appetite for risk has diminished, pushing up the level of returns demanded from equities by investors before they consider buying. In terms of our hypothetical toss of the coin, investors are now demanding a greater potential win before they'll risk their \u00a3100 stake. </p> <p><strong> Surefire winners</strong><br> </p> <p> This change in the psychology of the markets is borne out by my everyday contact with investment institutions. One top performing unit trust manager confessed this week that he had to find some certain winners because a number of the flotations he backed at the start of the year are now holed below the waterline. </p> <p>This desperation makes him less rather than more likely to back today's new issues because he dare not compound his problem. Actually, his best bet might be to increase his fund's commitment to flotations. The recent decline of equities has led to an exaggerated reduction in the valuation of companies coming to market. But then again, this is the real world. </p> <p>The surreal investment world embraces a multiplicity of oddballs and oddball schemes. The latest to catch my eye is a planned day trading centre between the City and the West End, equipped with gym and wine bar to de-stress those held in thrall of their trading screens. </p> <p>Call me old fashioned, if you like. Scorn me as a risk averse man who needs a \u00a3101 potential return before he will endanger \u00a3100. I just think day trading is a mug's game, appealing only to the financially desperate or those for whom risk is the drug of choice. There's little point in being hoity-toity about stock markets. Yes, they often resemble casinos. Yes, they encourage man's baser instincts. But for the sake of their long term health and reputation, the authorities must promote toindividuals the merits of informed investment over outright gambling. </p> <p>The current correction in share prices will, in time, bring with it the seeds of eventual recovery. Perceptions of risk will adjust. By then, though, a slew of punters willing to risk \u00a3100 to gain \u00a350 might find themselves bereft of coins to toss. </p> <p>\u0095 Edmond Warner is chief executive of Old Mutual Securities </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk\">edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>SmithKline Beecham, the owner of Aquafresh toothpaste, looks set to take a big bite out of the dental care market by snapping up Block Drug, the US manufacturer of Sensodyne. </p> <p>The pharmaceuticals company, which is in the middle of merging with rival Glaxo Wellcome, is lining up a bid for the up-for-sale business reported to be worth about $1.2bn (\u00a3800m).</p> <p>Neither SmithKline nor Block would comment but an alysts said the combination made sense. Bill Blair of Nomura said: \"Sensodyne is a very good brand and it would fit in a different market sector to Aquafresh.\"</p> <p>Sensdodyne is targeted at people with particularly sensitive teeth, and does not compete directly with Aquafresh - a lower priced, high volume brand.</p> <p>In addition to making Sensodyne, Block Drug manufactures cleansers and adhesives for false teeth, mouthwash, laxatives and ointment for nappy rash.</p> <p>A family controlled business, Block Drug was established in 1907 by a Lithuanian pharmacist, Alexander Block, who opened a drugstore in Brooklyn, New York. The company, which joined the New York stock market in 1971, is chaired by Mr Block's grandson, James.</p> <p>Members of the Block family have been frustrated by the company's poor share price performance, however.</p> <p>They indicated their wish to sell up four months ago by appointing the investment bank Goldman Sachs to advise on \"strategic options\".</p> <p>An auction has been gathering pace, with other possible bidders including the household products group Unilever and Colgate, the world's biggest toothpaste maker. SmithKline is thought to be among the leading contenders, but the outcome is by no means a foregone conclusion.</p> <p>There was some surprise at SmithKline's interest because the drugs company is expected to concentrate on medicines after its merger with Glaxo. There has been speculation that the group's toothpaste business could be sold, along with its drinks operation - which owns Lucozade, Ribena and Horlicks.</p> <p>One analyst said: \"They've made noises about spinning these bits off. But by buying a business, integrating it and producing cost savings, they could make it more attractive for a future sale.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year, there were suggestions that SmithKline was selling its consumer businesses to the Swiss healthcare group Novartis. However, this never materialised.</p> <p>Block Drug has profit margins of about 20% - well above those of many other consumer healthcare companies. The company's sales last year rose 10% to $884m (\u00a3590m).</p> <p>SmithKline's dental care products - which include Aquafresh, Macleans, Dr Best and German toothpaste Odol, notched up total sales of \u00a3585m last year.</p> <p>SmithKline's former chief executive, Jan Leschly, who retired earlier this year, was keen on expanding the group's consumer healthcare business. He argued that by becoming an all-round supplier of goods to chemists, the company could keep control of older medicines which moved off prescription to become over-the-counter products.</p> <p>However, Glaxo has taken a different view, preferring to specialise almost entirely on developing new prescription medicines.</p> <p>The two companies are still awaiting clearance from the federal trade commission to complete their merger, which was originally due to be finalised in the summer.</p>",
  "On Tuesday this week the lead story in our tabloid second section, G2, was about the shooting in Gaza of the 12-year-old Palestinian boy, Mohammed al-Durrah. It was illustrated with all but one of the eight available frames showing the last moments of the boy's life, filmed by a Palestinian cameraman working for French television. <p>These images were shown on television on Saturday night. Two of the frames appeared on the front page of late editions of the Observer, the only paper to use them so prominently on Sunday - something for which several of the paper's readers criticised it (in my view misguidedly, or let us say precipitately, since I believe that the events of the week have endorsed the decision to use the pictures). </p> <p>I inquired about the reaction from Observer readers to see whether it had differed in any way from the response to the Guardian's use of these images. On almost every occasion in the past three years when we have used pictures as strong as these, and certainly when we have shown pictures of dead people - in Northern Ireland, Kosovo, Sierra Leone or Zimbabwe - a number of you have complained, and on all of those occasions we have considered the pros and cons in this column. This time, by Thursday anyway, many of you had voiced your reaction to the event, and a selection of your letters was published, but no one complained that our use of the pictures was intrusive, exploitative, cynical or sensational, the accusations made on previous occasions. Did we do something right? </p> <p>By the time the Guardian used the pictures on Tuesday it seems likely that most of the paper's readers had seen some of them already. By Tuesday our website had considered and rejected the idea of putting up the movie footage, I think rightly, although one of the senior journalists involved in our treatment of the story in the paper said he could not see any distinction in ethical terms between showing still pictures (which we did) and moving pictures (which we did not). Can you? </p> <p>Our Middle East editor has written about this in his column on our website. For those of you who do not have internet access, this is what he says: \"Inevitably, video clips have appeared on the internet and now all you need do is click your mouse to have Mohammed brought back to life and shot again and again and again. Apart from being unbelievably ghoulish, this removes the event from the brutal realities of Middle East politics and dumps it in the realm of fantasy video games.\" </p> <p>Let us turn back to G2. The front page was stripped of the contents panel that normally runs across the top of the page and instead the contents were flagged in a single line across the foot of the page. This released almost the whole of the page for an image of the terrified Mohammed sheltering beneath the protective arm of his father. It carried the headline: What really happened at Netzarim crossroads? </p> <p>The following three pages, which included six more of the images from the sequence, sought an answer. Our correspondent went to the scene, spoke to the cameraman, and interviewed the boy's mother and others in a straightforward and memorable piece of reporting that suggested that the boy and his father had been targeted and shot by Israeli soldiers. The Israeli authorities have since said the two were mistaken for gunmen. </p> <p>The deputy editor (news) said that looking at the situation on Monday he felt that what was needed was a piece of reporting to try to cut through the obfuscation that was then prevalent. The presentation was obviously shocking but not gratuitously so. \"For all sorts of reasons you wanted to know exactly what had happened. The boy and his father were there for something like 45 minutes. You felt indignation. And the internal reaction, the reaction inside Israel - 21 lines in the main paper - was past understanding.\" </p> <p> The editor of G2 said the image on the front on Tuesday would radicalise you. \"It would make you want to pick up a stone.\" But he said his main anxiety was not to act as judge and jury. If it was a trial you would want more evidence than we had been able to produce, good though it was. </p> <p>I asked the journalist who wrote the report what effect she thought the pictures had had. She said inside the country they had hardened the hearts of Israelis and made the Palestinians more violent. She felt that more rather than fewer people had died as an immediate result. </p> <p>Farther away, we hope they have a different effect. Someone in the office said, \"You immediately think of the child closest to you, whether you have children of your own or not.\" You want it to stop. In passing we might ask ourselves what we know about the other children, one of them only two years old, who have died in the violence this week. </p> <p>\u0095 For more on our coverage of the events in Israel and the Middle East visit: <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/israel\" target=\"_NEW\">www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/israel</a> Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 020-7239 9589 between 11am and 5pm Monday to Friday.

  "<p>Can anything check the rise of the solipsist? My own poor old trade is now ineradicably polluted by people whose only function is to blather about themselves, and now the same infection is sweeping over politics too. There used to be a moment at the end of his shows where the impressionist Mike Yarwood would stop being Harold Wilson and Edward Heath and Robin Day and say: \"And now this is me.\" </p> <p>The same practice has been apparent through this year's party conference season. There was that point in Tony Blair's speech at Brighton where he suddenly abandoned his text and spoke spontaneously (we were supposed to think) from the heart. A lot of people in the hall seemed to find this profoundly moving. Watching it on TV, I found it creepy. Even his diction changed: all at once he was in his chat show mode, saying ah instead of I, and glottal-stopping away like a totter from Tooting. If this is the real Blair, I thought, who was that well-spoken chap we've been listening to for the previous 40 minutes? </p> <p>Then at Bournemouth this week we had that tear-stained sequence when Michael Portillo, abandoning his text altogether and speaking (we were supposed to think) spontaneously from the heart, came out as - well, all sorts of things. A Spaniard, for instance. And a hospital porter. </p> <p> This also explains a phenomenon which has baffled Smallweed all year. Why do people warm to Charles Kennedy when he says so little of substance? His leader's speech at the Lib Dem conference last month was as vacuous a concoction as Smallweed has heard in 40 years of conference-going. Yet he is the one whose ratings are rising. Is it perhaps precisely because he seems so unpolitical that the nation is growing to like him? </p> <p>For reasons beyond my control I write without having seen William Hague's performance, but I think it is pretty clear what form it will have taken. Suddenly half way through he will have abandoned his text, left the rostrum, stood at the end of the stage and begun to confess the terrible grief he felt at the age of four when his teddy bear was snaffled in a Rotherham park by a labrador. With the hall now awash with tears, the mood will then have changed with the appearance of those stroppy sisters of his, as seen on TV last weekend, and a song-and-dance routine of 60s hits will have ensued. </p> <p>Finally, amidst vast ululations, Ffion will have dropped from the rafters on to the stage like Peter Pan in the pantomime, and she and William will then have gone into a snoggy clinch far out-Goreing the Gores. In the end, the party chairman, a Mr Ancram, will only have prised them apart by throwing large amounts of cold water over them. </p> <p> Exactly the same is happening in the US. I saw a focus group session after the Gore-Bush encounter in which a woman who looked like an adult said she was swinging to Bush because though Gore had a much better command of the issues. Bush seemed the sweeter guy. A woman who put it the other way round - Bush seemed the nicer guy, but Gore was more in command of the issues and therefore more voteworthy - came across as a frosty old puritan. </p> <p>Is this is the way the leadership of the world's most powerful nation stands to be decided? Has there ever (final rhetorical question) been a sillier age than ours? </p> <p> Incidentally, Smallweed was astonished to hear a BBC reporter predicted that Tory chairman Ancram would give a barnstorming speech. I know that as party chairman he has to pretend, like poor old Chris Patten before him, to be what he clearly is not, but barnstorming is not a world I would ever have attached to him. </p> <p>Were I a barn, I would feel quite unworried if I saw Ancram approaching armed to the teeth. Though he might be uttering monstrous menaces, I would know that when he reached me he would not go through with any of them, but would whip out a guitar and serenade me with whatever brand of music he'd expect a barn to enjoy. Barn dance music, presumably. </p> <p> Enough of that. The season is changing. For reasons beyond my control, the winds are rocking the trees, and the skies are still dark when I wake in the morning. The stores, meanwhile, are full of Christmassery, and soon one will have to avoid them altogether because the air will be fill of saccharine songs about Santa and sleigh bells. For Christmas this year I intend to give almost everyone one of the most entertaining books in the world: A Lexicon of Musical Invective, by Nicolas Slonimsky, a compilation of insults hurled, mostly by critics, at notable music. </p> <p>But who - I hear Arthur Tartt, of Northowram, Halifax asking - is Slonimsky? Sadly he recently died, having first passed 100, but he used to be a musicologist, composer, conductor and pianist who performed some of the works most complained about. \"For two hours,\" wrote a critic when he conducted Var\u00e8se in Berlin in 1932, \"Slonimsky bore down on the Philharmonic musicians until they finally made no secret of their ugly disposition.\" </p> <p>After his performance of the same composer's Ionaization at the Hollywood Bowl the following year, he received a postcard imploring him to perform the writer's own composition scored for two stoves and a kitchen sink. It was signed: Iona Lotta Bunk (probably a pseudonym). </p> <p>His Lexicon is rarely to be spotted in bookshops, so between now and Christmas I hope to unleash some of the riper gems in this great man's collection in the hope that stockists will get the message and race out to order copies from the Washington University Press. </p> <p> And finally, yet another strange death of a famous musician. The opera composer Vincenzo Bellini (who wrote Norma and La Sonnambula) died in Paris, where he had fled to avoid a scandal, in 1835, a few weeks short of his 34th birthday. The cause of death was given as dysentery and gastro-enteritis. But there have long been suspicions that Bellini was actually poisoned by the husband of one of the many wives to whom he had helped himself. It is now proposed to exhume his remains. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:Smallweed@theguardian.com\">Smallweed@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>I don't know how long he'd been standing there. Some actors can do that, make themselves into a hole in the air just by turning themselves off. Most of them do the opposite, come on full-pelt with all their well-rehearsed little sensibilities and idiosyncrasies, so that you think it must be your birthday until you discover that every journalist in the western world has been privy to an identical performance. It seems to be a question of who they're in the habit of being, professionally; themselves or someone else. Given that these days the big movie-selling proposition, the trick that inflates box-office takings, is personality recognition, you don't often find yourself in a room with a star coming on like a hologram. </p> <p>Guy Pearce (I told him, babbling somewhat) reminds me of an actor I used to know who had this amazing knack of becoming invisible when he didn't want to be looked at. It was as though he could do something to his skin, at will, that made your eyes slide off him. \"Was he a good actor?\" asked the man-shaped thing, beginning to substantiate. \"Absolutely,\" I said, \"on stage you couldn't take your eyes off him.\" A faint expression of something like gratification flushed a lean jowl. \"Yeah,\" he said, as in, \"Thank God for that\", and permitted further out-fleshing: handsome, yes, blue-eyed, blue-jeaned, hair like the rats have gnawed it, huge muddy hiking boots and silver rings on at least two fingers. </p> <p>He offers a yard-wide grin and the small intimacy of the sure and certain fact that if I hadn't asked the publicity crew to vacate, he would have done. It was bad enough for him to meet a stranger without having the ghost of a character to wrap himself up in, without getting a bloody audience into the bargain. Circumstances such as these, he says, bring on the big anxiety rush, make his heart pound. He thumps himself somewhere below his left shoulder by way of illustration. And the voice in his head, always the same, goes \"keep it together keep it together keep it together keep it together\", and he's buggered if he knows why, except that he can't tolerate people forming an opinion of him, being the victim of their conclusions while they think he's weird or boring or miserable or whatever. </p> <p>Years ago, he had to go to a conference for young Australian actors hoping to make the big move to Hollywood and some know-all was instructing them they'd have to employ a publicist because publicists publicise your personality. He was puzzling that one out when Sam Neill piped up how he could do without one of those on account of the fact that he doesn't have a personality to publicise. Which is how he feels to this day. He means, Jeez, what's he supposed to do? Roar about going, Way-hey, hup-zing, look at my personality? \"Nah.\" He doesn't have that kind of confidence, which is another thing to be anxious about. </p> <p>Take yesterday. He'd been supposed to spend the morning with photographers and publicists in charge of making the posters for The Count Of Monte Cristo. Fair enough. He turned up on time, got into period costume and did what he was told, then they wanted him to take his cossie off and \"be himself\". Why? What has himself to do with the film? </p> <p>They told him they reckoned that The Count Of Monte Cristo meant zilch to \"the young\", whereas they'd recognise Guy Pearce because he'd been in Neighbours. So he got out of his cossie and sloped off home, like, you know, fuck that . He worries about these things. A mate tried to calm him once, saying, look, it's showbusiness, pronouncing it \"pissiness\", then making it sound even more obscene, \"Show Business \", as in, where's the art in that? It makes you anxious. Particularly when you're a miserable, sarky sod like himself, always seeing the negative side. </p> <p>He's a synapse, he says suddenly, and, no, he doesn't know how you bloody spell it, he just knows what it is. A bunch of raw nerves. He feels like one of those sea anemones, waving their tendrils about until something swims by and they immediately close up like a fist. Unless it is a clown fish. They don't seem to mind clown fish. So that's him, really. Barring the odd encounter with a clown fish, he's just this bundle of nerves who keeps himself to himself until he gets up to do his shtick, which is the whole attraction of being an actor in the first place. </p> <p>Except he does worry a lot that he's not really an actor, that he's just acting being an actor and that deep down he's a fraud, deluding himself. You can't help thinking like that when you've just made a film such as Memento, which this particular publicity-fest is supposed to be in aid of. Responses so far have been \"interesting\", in the sense that people he'd have marked up as intellectual and educated don't seem to understand what the hell it was about, while other, less ostentatiously brainy types get it in one. So what did I think? </p> <p>Art house is what I thought. Noir as Newgate's knocker. Low budget. I thought it was a metaphor for the human condition, and the human condition is so disgusting I don't want to look at it. I thought we are all, all of us, a load of self-serving, self-pitying, manipulative, murderous, greedy, spiteful, vengeful, frighened, confused, pointless shits who keep reminding ourselves to keep up the good work of being a load of self-serving, self-pitying, etcetera and so forth, and I loved the film. \"Yeah,\" he said, \"that's why I loved making it.\" </p> <p>He's not supposed to say what it cost to make. He's not supposed to say that they made the whole film in 25 days flat or that it didn't cost more than $4 million or $5 million. Bad for business, you understand. In the US, they've worked it all out, like, hey, man, it's going to be a $60 million movie, then we get Tom Cruise, which makes it an $80 million movie, then we employ 70 or 80 blokes to stand around on the set scratching themselves and wondering what they can throw more money at. Then they work out the stats of the first week's box-office takings and publish them, so the punters can be assured that the film is already into profit even though the serious reviews say that it's crap. And it works. People go to see the movie and come away saying, well, yes, it was absolute rubbish, but it had lots of huge explosions and it cost $150 million. It has all been something of a culture shock for a simple Aussie actor who is used to making films where actual pride is taken on not pissing money up the wall. So, no, he's not moving to Los Angeles. So far as he's concerned, a job's a job and he's lucky to get one anywhere, but when it's over he lets America trundle on in the way it trundles on and Mr Pearce gets on a plane and goes home to Oz. </p> <p>He used to think he was just a cynical bastard, but now he's not so sure. Maybe he's just another pragmatic Aussie who can't help seeing things the way they are, which is not very nice. He would, for instance, say that he had a wonderful childhood, blessed with a wonderful mother and a wonderful sister and wonderful friends, and that would be nothing but the truth. </p> <p>Only then he made Memento and believed in it and began to wonder about himself. About his own memories. The explicit theme of the film is about a man who loses his short-term memory and has to remind himself, by writing notes to himself and tattooing his emotional status quo all over his body, that he has a score to settle. In other words, he is both a victim and a predator, and has no means of knowing which unlovely side of his character is uppermost at any given moment. Once you start thinking about the implications of that little lot, you have to question the entire contents of your brain. You can't be too careful. </p> <p>Only so much is assured. Guy was born in England, somewhere south of Cambridge, with a New Zealander father and a British mother - he was a test pilot employed by the Royal Air Force, she a schoolteacher specialising in needlework and home economics. His sister's name is Tracy. The family moved to Bristol and then, when he was three, to Australia. </p> <p>So far, so good. He can't be expected to remember England, even though he's always known he can drop into an English accent whenever he needs to. Come to that, he can drop into just about any accent he fancies, just when he feels like it. Anyway, he grew up in Geelong, which is an hour's drive south of Melbourne in the state of Victoria, where, unlike the rest of Australia, it gets very cold in winter and very hot in summer. Geelong was great. It still is. He went to school and had lots of mates and once, by way of a hobby, his mum ran a deer farm there. It wasn't a thriving business, exactly, they just had the deer wandering about, and once a year they'd strip their antlers and sell them to somebody who made a Chinese remedy out of them. He doesn't know what it was a remedy for. </p> <p> He's not entirely sure he remembers this, but he knows, like he knows what a synapse is, that it happened on August 6, 1976, and it was a Friday. It had been Tim's mum's turn to pick them up from school, and the two boys sat in the back of the car on the way home, arranging to meet later. Tim's mum said, no, she didn't think so, which was odd, so they mouthed their own silent intent at each other and Guy went in for his tea. He could tell at once that something special was up, because they seemed to have been visited by all their Kiwi relatives at once and his mum took him up to his room and sat on the end of his bed. He remembers her telling him that his dad had been killed at work and then he remembers seeing her standing in a doorframe bawling her eyes out. He does not remember thinking or feeling anything much more than a small frisson of surprise that his mother was out of control for the first - and, as it happens, the last - time in his life. </p> <p>Guy and his sister didn't go to their father's funeral. Mum went, they stayed at home. And afterwards life went on in the same way as before, except that dad wasn't around any more. He's not sure he has any true, independent memory of his father at all. Of course, he idolised him. He knew, because everybody told him so, that his father was as heroic as it gets. That he was profoundly decent and witty and wonderful. A man without a flaw. </p> <p>There were photographs of his father in the house, and adults who had known him would point out how, looked at in profile, Guy was beginning to resemble him. But mostly there were pictures of him in cockpits and wide-angle shots of jet aircraft so that, being only seven years old, Guy thought that perhaps a Lockhead Lightning was his dad. He had a lot to live up to. He never thought as a child that he was different from other kids because he didn't have a father. It was more that his family as a unit was more controlled, more circumspect, than other families. It felt to him as though they had some great secret to protect. He'd see other families screaming and shouting at each other, letting it all hang out, and he'd think, we're not like that. </p> <p>He supposes that he began to be a bit of a loner at that point. He perceived himself as a well-behaved, responsible boy. His mother told him so, and he believed her. Sometimes, when he was by himself having a bit of a think or trying to work out how something worked, his mum would say to him, \"Get that miserable look off your face\", and he'd immediately go into idiot-happy-boy mode: Oh, right, I'm not miserable, I'm fine, ha-ha-ha. Which he's rather afraid he still does. In fact, he's getting sick of himself expending all his energy cracking on that he's feeling what he imagines other people want him to feel. </p> <p>Ah, but he's not blaming his mum. She coped as best she could. He ran away from school when he was nine. A whole gang of them took off into the wide blue yonder until the cops caught them and sent for their mothers. He remembers watching the other mums claiming their lads. \"Are you all right?\" \"Thank God you're safe!\" All that sort of thing. And then his mum came and said to him grimly, \"If your dad was alive, he'd send you to the technical school for this.\" Which was tantamount to threatening him with reform school. </p> <p>He used to envy other boys their insouciance, their natural ability to tell their mothers to fuck off. He could never do that, because she was always there saying, \"You are such a responsible boy\", while he turned himself inside out to justify her faith in him. Sometimes, he thinks he's spent his entire life waiting for someone to come along and tell him who he is, because he's buggered if he knows. He even wonders if being good at finding a character to be and then being it means he's not even a real actor. Just a kid with a deep, dark, hidden quality that he seems to draw on but doesn't necessarily understand. </p> <p>It was his mum who first took him to the theatre. They'd go to the Geelong Society of Operatic and Dramatic Art, called Gesoda for short, and he knew right away that he wanted to have the affect on people that the actors on the stage were having on him. This had nothing to do with a hidden extrovert quality lurking beneath his guarded exterior. Far from it. He knew from an early age that he could impersonate linguistically. He loved the music of different accents, the whole different language of them and the energy behind them. But he was never the class clown. If he took someone off, he'd make it short; wait for the gasp and the recognition and then stop. He was more likely to use a funny voice to deflect attention from himself than to court the amusement of his peers. </p> <p>He lived in dread of Tuesday mornings when some luckless schoolboy would be obliged to stand up in front of assembly and read aloud the news and sports reports. The idea of presenting himself as himself gave him crippling stage fright. Yet being in a play didn't count. He remembers, or thinks he remembers, the occasion of his first stage role. He must have been nine years old when the school put on a musical version of something called Smith, culled from an English television series. They gave him the title role, and he made a job of this Oliver Twist sort of kid who talked wiv a cockney accent an kep gettin inter trouble. </p> <p>When the first show was over, the cast stood in a line across the stage and the audience applauded and then he had to step forward on his own while everyone clapped and cheered. He remembers he got a buzz, but it wasn't the buzz that mattered; it was what came into his head. The words, \"It works.\" He says he's not very articulate and, of course, he might have made it up after the event and it might not be a true memory at all. But he can still hear it; that clear, triumphal, almost grim little voice. \"It works.\" </p> <p>So he joined Gesoda-for-short, and effectively began his career at the age of 11. Acting and singing were what he did with his time. He had some idea of being a rock singer, but then so did most boys. He is, he says, very narrow-minded. To illustrate his point, he does something with his hands, something meticulous, as though he's mending a particularly delicate wristwatch. He concentrates on what he's doing for as long as it takes and that's all there is to it. He has no sense of ambition, never thought that one day he'd go to Hollywood and be a Hollywood star. It just happened. Local theatre, audition for TV show, TV show, film script, film, play, film script, film, film script, film, Hollywood. That's the chronology, but it was never a career, a progression with a beginning, a middle and an end, a linear journey towards the big bucks. </p> <p>So far as he is concerned, each part he plays is separate from the one before, of the same intrinsic value, but different. What gives him a thrill is the idea that, if he goes on working for the next 60 years, someone would look back at what he's done and say, wow, what a diverse range of stuff. </p> <p>He'd like to be an actor of the Gary Oldman quality. He believes him, always, whatever he does. As opposed to, say, Tom Cruise or George Clooney, who are, well, Tom Cruise and George Clooney. He means, good on 'em and all that, they've got a niche and they're probably great guys when you meet them, but he's not interested. If you know what he means. </p> <p>The price of fame, apparently, is not all that exorbitant for the kind of actor he has become. He finds it particularly gratifying at this juncture to realise that he can wander freely through the streets of Dublin without being besieged by teenaged girls waving autograph books and grabbing his bits. He was a little nervous when he arrived because Neighbours is huge in Ireland, so they tell him. But everyone seems to have grown up now, or forgotten who he used to be. Which is nothing if not respectful of them. He did four years on Ramsay Street playing Mike, the damaged lad, bad childhood, bashed and abandoned by his parents, adopted into Jason and Kylie's world. Daggy. Very daggy. And everywhere he went between the ages of 18 and 22 there were girls screaming, \"Guy Pearce, Guy Pearce\", and following him about. Not that it turned his head. Why would it, when they'd do exactly the same to Bouncer the dog? Something similar happens now, if he's not careful. </p> <p>Going home to Australia from Hollywood, suddenly he's the big star who's kicked American butt and that makes it hard to go back to the theatre to resume what he's good at. He tried it last year, and the bloody fools oversold him and unbalanced the relationship between himself and the other actors. And again, his hands explore the complicated mechanism of the imaginary timepiece. </p> <p>He seems to find something slightly absurd about his chosen profession, something a touch pathetic about being a man who \"shape-shifts\" for a living. At the same time, he hopes that, if he does enough of it and people recognise the value of his talent to metamorphose, he'll calm down as a man and find the confidence to be himself, or, as he puts it, \"be a boring git when I feel like it\". When I tell him that, in my inexpert opinion, his film roles to date might be categorised as giving good mean-streak, he takes it as a rose to pin in his buttonhole. </p> <p>He is not villain material, he merely has a rare and subtle ability to flash the dark, hidden side of a personality without either tearing the arse out of it or persuading you to dislike him. His pious young cop in LA Confidential, Hollywood-drawn rather corny Clark Kentish figure, on the side of law and order, brave as a lion when it comes to the crunch, might have been predictably dull, except that somehow, fleetingly, he managed to convey that he actually enjoys shopping his erring colleagues. The drag queen in The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert might have been a spiteful tart who takes pleasure in calling a transsexual \"Ralph\", but for the tender, womanly split-second of his feelings towards a child. </p> <p>His prosecuting attorney in Rules Of Engagement might have been another soulless jobsworth, except he also indicates the sad vulnerability of a man trapped in a testosterone-oriented environment. Wherever he's going, as a shape-shifter, he's well on his way. </p> <p>He thinks one day soon he's going to go looking for the reality of his father; talk to his father's sisters and brothers-in-laws in New Zealand to find out what else he was, besides a paragon of heroism. He thinks it will make him feel better about himself. As it is, he feels as though he's 100 years old, the most practical, responsible, adult person in the history of the world, while running alongside an eight-year-old kid who can only imagine a personality and play it out, the whole caboodle held together by an anxiety neurosis without which he'd be so lost he'd trip over himself and fall down a hole. </p> <p>He is also grievously homesick. He can't believe he's saying this, but he's a married man. Three years ago, he met Kate, and they got married. She's the kind of woman, he says, that when you're at a party you know that you can catch her eye across a crowded room and exchange the wonderful, silent intimacy of acknowledging that everyone in the place is a dickhead. </p> <p>They haven't had any children because they have this thing about over-population and, besides, they like animals. Animals, you understand, being emotionally upfront and honest, unlike human beings. They've got four fish, two cats and a dog called Zelda. She's an African hunting dog, a basenji. He is of the enchantingly Darwinian opinion that, once upon a time, cats and dogs were the same animal and then, for some reason of biological interference, they split into two distinct animals. In this regard, Zelda is a cuspal creature, two legs dog, two legs cat. For one thing, she does not bark, barking being a purely man-made function caused by the stresses put upon dogs by their colonists. No, Zelda yodels and yowls. She also washes herself and climbs trees. </p> <p>Jeez, but he misses Zelda. He wants to go home and dig his garden and bum around and smoke huge amounts of pot and think about what he's going to do next. I think maybe we'd better leave out the bit about the pot, in case they won't let him back into America. He thinks about it for a moment. His hands do their watch-mending thing, then he says, upfront and honest, \"I don't give a shit.\"</p>",
  "<p>A website called Ask Jeeves was not what Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse had in mind when he created his resourceful gentleman's gentleman. But, like any instant oracle, it has its uses. For one thing, it offers an intriguing insight into what keeps other people awake at night. According to one recent survey, the question most frequently asked of Jeeves was, \"Why do farts smell?\" Another favourite, for which the site has a ready-prepared answer, was, \"Why is poop brown?\" (The Americans have such a cute way with words.) It may not be the sort of topic that Bertie Wooster mulled over with his butler of an evening, but the rest of us, it seems, still get a buzz from talking dritty. </p> <p>Dritty? No, it's not a spelling error. A long time ago, when our language was still emerging from the long Icelandic winter, people used the word \"drit\" instead of \"poop\". The Old English \"gedriten\" meant to ... well, you can work it out. Eventually, \"drit\" thawed and softened into \"dirt\", and before long it covered everything in sight - everything that was in the least bit impure or that contaminated other things. </p> <p>Today, \"dirt\" still denotes dung and droppings. But it is also grime and grot, slobber and slime, soil and smut. Dirt is filth, but it is stain and tarnish, too. It is muck on the mat and mud on the carpet. And it is a layer of dust on a piano and the lightest of smudges on a sheet of white paper. </p> <p>Dirt echoes through our language and touches every aspect of our lives, from dirty looks to dirty dishes, from Dirty Harry to dirty videos. Why does it occupy such a prominent position in our consciousness? Perhaps because, when we say \"dirt\", we still think \"drit\". Our aversion to excrement (generations of untouchables were forced to live on the fringes of Indian society because they alone were responsible for emptying the latrines) is as universal as it is powerful. Yet drit will always be with us. </p> <p>Thus finishing his grand survey, <br>Disgusted Strephon stole away <br>Repeating in his amorous fits, <br>Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits! <br><strong> From The Lady's Dressing Room, by Jonathan Swift</strong> </p> <p>The concept of normality comes up quite frequently in any discussion of faeces. Normally, we excrete between three and six ounces a day - ie, four tonnes in the average lifetime. Normal faeces are three-quarters water. Of the remaining solids, as much as half can consist of dead bacteria. That's normal. What's left is made up of indigestible food, fats, protein and minerals. Then there is cell debris and dead blood cells, plus several powerful-smelling chemicals. One of these, skatole, takes it name from the Greek word for dung. </p> <p>If you can stand the stench of skatole, there's no medical reason why you shouldn't eat faeces (connoisseurs say that it tastes like ripe Camembert), provided that the person or animal who produced it isn't carrying a deadly virus or a troublesome parasite. Coprophagia is common among dogs, horses and, to a lesser degree, small children. Are they just trying to be helpful? </p> <p>The dung beetle, a kind of scarab, uses its head to form manure into a ball which can be as big as an apple. Then it buries itself in the ball and feeds on it, eating more than its own weight in 24 hours. In Egyptian cosmogony, the ball represented the earth and the beetle the sun. And that question about the colour? \"Stuff happens,\" says Jeeves. \"In fact, it happens all the time. Your body is always going through cycles - routines - all the time. One of them is the creation, use and re-use of blood cells. A chemical called bilirubin (bill-e-ROO-bin) is made when your body takes old blood cells apart. And bilirubin is brown.\" Thanks old chum. </p> <p>O thou shrouded in thy mantle, arise and warn! Thy Lord do thou magnify, thy robes purify and defilement flee! <br><strong> From the Koran, 74:1-4</strong> </p> <p>Until the 19th century, when scientists began to recognise that disease is caused by invisible organisms, personal hygiene was a hit-and-miss affair. If the well-to-do enjoyed bathing, it was generally for aesthetic reasons, or for fun. And then there was religion. Since earliest times, people have considered it expedient to purify themselves before their gods. That familiar line about cleanliness and godliness is often attributed to John Wesley, the co-founder of English Methodism. \"Cleanliness is indeed next to godliness,\" he said in a sermon about the need for Christians to dress smartly. But the preacher was referring to a Hebrew saying, believed to originate with the ancient rabbi Phinehas ben Yair. For not only did Moses pass on the Ten Commandments, but he also gave the Israelites detailed laws on cleanliness and religious purification. </p> <p>Even the origin of soap seems to be imbued with religious significance. According to Roman legend, it got its name from Mount Sapo, a popular spot for the sacrificing of animals. Whenever rain washed a mixture of melted fat and wood ashes down into the clay soil along the Tiber, women washing their clothes in the river were said to have found the job much easier if they used the soapy clay. </p> <p>Man does not live by soap alone; and hygiene, or even health, is not much good unless you can take a healthy view of it - or, better still, feel a healthy indifference to it. <br><strong> From All I Survey, by GK Chesterton, 1933</strong> </p> <p>The Phoenicians were preparing soap from goat tallow and wood ashes in 600BC (they used it to barter with the Gauls), and the Celts produced something similar, which they called \"saipo\" (so much for the Mount Sapo theory). But none of these people realised that they could use the stuff for washing. Until the 2nd century AD, soap was used either as a treatment for skin conditions or as a sort of hair gel. With the decline of the Pax Romana, Europe almost forgot about soap again. Some was still made around medieval Marseille, and later in Genoa and Venice. But even in 1672, a German sending a box of Italian soap to a Lady von Schleinitz felt it prudent to enclose a set of instructions as to its use. </p> <p>In England, the few soapmakers who did set up shop from the end of the 12th century were heavily taxed, and after the Napoleonic wars soap duty was jacked up so abruptly that soap-boiling pans had to be sealed by the tax collector at the end of each day in order to prevent illicit nocturnal production. When the tax was abolished in 1853, demand went through the roof. </p> <p>With soap so readily available, it was transformed from a luxury into a necessity, and the chemist Justus von Liebig was moved to remark that the civilisation of a nation could now be measured in terms of the quantity of soap it consumed. </p> <p>But when the first world war broke out, fat was needed for more important things. So, in 1916, German chemists developed synthetic detergents. In no time at all, the cracked, green lump at the end of the draining board had metamorphosed into a cupboardful of exciting cleaning products. So fierce was competition among rival manufacturers that in the 30s they began sponsoring daytime drama serials on US radio - and the term \"soap opera\" was born. </p> <p> Hygiene is the corruption of medicine by morality. <br><strong> From Prejudices, by HL Mencken, 1922</strong> </p> <p>Miasma is a strange and evocative word, but what does it evoke exactly? The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as, \"Infections or noxious exhalations from putrescent organic matter\". But in his award-winning book, Biography Of A Germ (Victor Gollancz, \u00a316.99), Arno Karlen goes into riveting detail. In the 1820s, he says, when deadly waves of cholera swept out of Bengal, \"most experts laughed at the notion that creatures too small to be seen could fell armies and turn cities into cemeteries\". Disease, these experts knew, \"was caused by miasmas, noxious vapours that arose from putrefying organic stuff\". </p> <p>As it happened, this false belief fuelled England's sanitary reform movement, led by Sir Edwin Chadwick. \"They collected refuse, tore down hovels, built sewers and pulled dead dogs from the water supply. It was the beginning of something we now take for granted, massive government intervention to protect public health.\" </p> <p>When cholera again struck England in 1866, there were far fewer infections, which seemed to confirm Chadwick's theory that dirt caused disease. \"What the reformers actually proved,\" says Karlen, \"was that good results can flow from flawed theories; some kinds of dirt might invite and spread cholera, but they were not the cause. Therefore sanitation could reduce the epidemic but not eliminate it.\" </p> <p>Not until 1883 did Robert Koch isolate the bacterium that caused cholera, and so settle the thing once and for all. Yet, says Karlen, the equation of dirt with disease did not die. Rather, dirt and disease both became associated with microbes. \"There persisted an old magical association of epidemics with physical and moral filth.\" </p> <p>By the 20th century, most people accepted the germ theory, yet we still tell children \"that dirt and germs are synonymous, and that both will make them sick\". </p> <p> A disease known is half cured. <br><strong> From Gnomologia, by Thomas Fuller MD, 1732</strong> </p> <p>Many people - Koch, Joseph Lister and Louis Pasteur to name but three - helped to establish our present understanding of germs, dirt, contagion and disease. But the work of the Hungarian physician Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis most clearly illustrates the difficulties faced by these pioneers. </p> <p>In 1844, Semmelweis took up the post of assistant at the obstetric clinic in Vienna, and soon came up against the problem of childbed fever. Right across Europe, puerperal infection regularly killed a quarter to a third of women who for one reason or another had to give birth in a maternity hospital. It was assumed that overcrowding, poor ventilation and miasma were the cause, and Semmelweis was discouraged from investigating further. But he couldn't help noticing that, in the section of the clinic staffed by midwives, the death rate was three times lower than in an identical section staffed by students. The students, he realised, were coming straight from the dissecting room to the maternity ward, bringing to healthy women the infection from mothers who had died of the disease. When he insisted that students disinfect their hands before each examination, the mortality rates dropped from 18.27% to 1.27%. But although his younger colleagues understood the significance of his discovery, Semmelweis found himself in trouble with his boss. </p> <p>For 20 years, he struggled to get his ideas accepted. One day, while he was performing an operation, a wound on his right hand became infected. In 1865 he suffered a breakdown and later died in a mental hospital of the same disease that he had fought all his life to control. After his death, medical science saw that Semmelweis had been right all along, and Lister subsequently paid tribute to his achievement: \"It fills me with joy,\" he said, \"that at last he is given the respect due to him.\" </p> <p>Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. <br><strong> From Genesis, 3:19</strong> </p> <p>Isn't it incredible how much dirt people bring into the house in the course of a day? All that soil and sand on their shoes. Then there's the dust that blows in from the street, the filth that comes in through the open window. And just look what the cat brought in ... </p> <p>Incredible? Quite unbelievable, in fact, since most household dirt is generated on the premises, by the creatures who live there. Between 75% and 80% of vacuum cleaner dirt consists of human skin cells - the dead bits we shed every time we move. The remainder contains hair and animal dander, plus the dust mites that feed on it. Oh, and there's the odd bit of grot that comes in on our shoes. </p> <p>The thing I hated most was the cockroaches. They lived in the lining of the fridge door, and every time you opened the fridge you set them off. Sometimes, it was half an hour before the noise died down. <br><strong> Friend of a friend, recalling student life in America</strong> </p> <p>The word cockroach comes from the Spanish \"cucaracha\" (remember those car horns that used to play La Cucaracha?). Such a jolly name for something that is universally regarded as one of the most loathsome of all household pests. There are more than 3,500 species, yet although only a few are pests, these few have given all cockroaches a bad name. Roaches eat both plant and animal products - anything from paper, clothing and books to dead insects (they are particularly fond of bedbugs). But like foxes, they damage more than they eat. And they smell awful. </p> <p>We are so often ashamed of the Earth - the soil of it, the sweat of it, the good common coarseness of it. To us in our fine raiment and soft manners, it seems indelicate. <br><strong> From Adventures In Contentment, by David Grayson, 1907</strong> </p> <p>Soil is packed full of bacteria. In a single tablespoonful, there are reckoned to be more bacteria than there are human beings on the planet. Capable of existing in extremes of heat or cold and without sunlight, they perform many functions vital to higher life forms, taking nitrogen from the air and converting it into the nitrates needed by plants, and breaking down organic material by soaking it in secreted enzymes and absorbing the result. Almost any material placed in soil will eventually be eaten by bacteria; a few years ago, scientists helping to clean up after a diesel oil spill were delighted to discover that the ground was full of fuel-eating bacteria known as pseudomonas. Research is currently underway to develop methods of purifying contaminated soil using these bacteria, which are so tiny that 50 of them could line up end-to-end across the cutting edge of a piece of paper. </p> <p>There are over 15 million wheelie bins in the UK and this number is growing daily. Quite simply VIP has developed their bin cleaning service to meet the demands of millions of households who use wheelie bins ... <br><strong> Advert for bin cleaning franchise opportunity</strong> </p> <p>Remember the turkey you ate last Christmas? Ever wonder what became of the carcass - or the one before that and the one before that? Chances are, they're all buried deep inside some worked-out gravel pit in Essex, bubbling away nicely, out of sight and out of mind. Each year in the UK, municipal dustcarts collect 28m tonnes of waste, and more than 80% of this ends up in landfill sites. These have come on a bit since the days when contractors simply chucked the rubbish into a hole and covered it with soil. The industry literature talks of clay-lined cells, of entombment landfill and bio-flushing reactor systems. But still nobody is exactly sure what goes on down there - or how long it takes for our rubbish to disappear. </p> <p>Research suggests that three phases of decomposition take place. The first uses up the oxygen buried with the waste, and is all over in less than a month. Next, a variety of micro-organisms start to eat the putrescent material, breaking it down into volatile fatty acids, alcohols and ammonia. This can take years or even decades. Finally, slow-acting bacteria begin digesting these substances to produce carbon dioxide and methane gas - a process which can last for many decades or even centuries. </p> <p>\"Methane is the worst of the greenhouse gases,\" says Sarah Oppenheimer at Friends of the Earth (FoE). \"It is eight times more potent than carbon dioxide. So not only are landfill sites a waste of resources, unsustainable and horrible to live near, but they are also bad for climate change.\" </p> <p>From next year, the European Landfill Directive will force site operators to flare off methane or use it to generate electricity. But it will also insist on a huge reduction in tipping. But the alternative is likely to be incineration, which FoE also opposes on health, pollution and climate grounds. \"Scores of new, large-scale incinerators are already popping up all over the country,\" says Oppenheimer. \"Yet up to 80% of household waste is compostable or recyclable.\" Something to bear in mind next time you get the wishbone. </p> <p>I was seized by the stern hand of Compulsion, that dark, unseasonable Urge that impels women to clean house in the middle of the night. <br><strong> From Alarms And Diversions, by James Thurber</strong> </p> <p>It wasn't easy being Howard Hughes. Billionaire he may have been, but by 1958, he was reduced to living naked in a corner of his Beverly Hills hotel room, handling everything with wads of tissue and dictating memos on the most hygienic way to open a tin of pineapple. Hughes was terrified of germs, and this, with its associated handwashing, is probably the most common manifestation of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), along with an overwhelming desire for tidiness. </p> <p>Around one in 30 people is reckoned to suffer from one or another form of OCD. Some have had the condition since birth, and most suffer in secret. But when the obsession is with personal hygiene and a fear of contamination, serious sufferers can wind up in hospital. At what point does fastidiousness tip over into obsessiveness? </p> <p>Colin Putney, of the charity Obsessive Action, reckons that when people begin acting in a ritualised way, it is time to seek help. \"Obviously there's normal cleanliness,\" he says, \"and there are people who are particularly clean. Then there are people who have to have everything just so, and if anything is moved, they get upset. This is borderline. Then you go beyond that into people who conduct daily rituals. If it involves rituals, that's OCD. It's out of control and it needs treatment. Because, if it's left untreated, it gets worse.\" </p> <p>But help is at hand, says Putney. Both pharmacological and psychological treatments are available, as well as self-help for sufferers and their families. </p> <p>'There won't be any revolution in America,' said Isadore. Nikitin agreed. 'The people are too clean. They spend all their time changing their shirts and washing themselves. You can't feel fierce and revolutionary in a bathroom.' <br><strong> From Juan In America, by Eric Linklater</strong> </p> <p>Worried about pongy feet? Slip on some antibacterial socks. Concerned about the state of your bedlinen? Perhaps you need an antibacterial quilt with matching pillow. There is talk of antibacterial chequebooks and antibacterial steering wheel covers. And with so much talk of food poisoning, you certainly need antibacterial cutting boards, surface cleaners, sponges and soaps. </p> <p>Or do you? What if this stuff is upsetting the balance of nature? What if it is causing superbugs? In 1997, supermarket giant J Sainsbury signed an exclusive deal with a US-based company called Microban that had come up with a clever way of incorporating the microbial inhibitor triclosan into a variety of plastics. Suddenly, supermarket shelves were filled with all manner of kitchen utensils whose surfaces were said to discourage bugs from multiplying. </p> <p>To those who claim it doesn't work, Micro-ban's champions point to all sorts of glowing test results. The Leatherhead Food Research Association, for example, contaminated treated and untreated conveyor belts with Escherichia coli , Salmonella enteriditis, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus - all major players in any number of food-poisoning outbreaks in recent years. The results were impressive. </p> <p>To those who accept that these products are effective, but who fear that, by suppressing the little bugs, they are opening the door to far nastier varieties, the industry says that, if this were going to happen, it would have been apparent in the 30 years since triclosan began appearing in toothpaste, mouthwash, deodorant and soap, as well as any number of antibacterial agents widely used in hospitals. Antibiotics may have given rise to drug-resistant germs, but not triclosan. </p> <p>\"The emergence of resistant bacteria is widely attributed by public-health experts to the misuse and overuse of antibiotics,\" says a joint statement from the US Soap and Detergent Association and the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association. \"Hospitals use antibacterial products every day to stop the spread of bacteria, including resistant bacteria.\" </p> <p>What separates two people most profoundly is a different sense and degree of cleanliness. <br><strong> From Beyond Good And Evil, by Friedrich Nietzsche, 1886</strong> </p> <p>When scientists at Bristol University asked mothers in the West Country how frequently they washed their children, the figures that came back showed huge variations. But when they compared these levels of hygiene with the children's health, the results were even more startling. Ultra-clean children, it seems, are more likely to suffer from allergies. As part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood, which will monitor the health of nearly 11,000 newborn babies as they grow into adults, Andrea Sherriff and a team at the Institute of Child Health graded the children according to how often they were washed in a day, then logged any occurrence of wheezing or skin rashes in their first 42 months. \"They were given scores of between zero and 14,\" says Sherriff. \"Zero meant they were practically never washed and 14 meant they were having their face and hands washed more than five times a day, always had their hands washed before meals, and were given a bath or shower more than once a day.\" </p> <p>No fewer than 43 children scored 14. \"These wee souls were having quite extraordinary levels of hygiene in the home,\" says Sherriff. \"And it was the ultra-hygienic children who were statistically more likely to get allergies.\" It occurred to the researchers that mothers who wash their children that frequently might also be using a lot of detergents, bleach, air fresheners and polish in the home, and that these chemicals might be responsible for the wheezing and skin conditions. But even when they built these factors into the statistical model, the allergies could still be related to the washing. </p> <p>Although the results have yet to be submitted for peer review, advanced publicity has already caused some indignation. But Sherriff insists that nobody wants to see a u-turn in personal hygiene. \"There would be huge public health implications if people sent their children out to play in the dirt and not wash them,\" she says. \"We would see all sorts of diseases that we've managed to eradicate because of our improved hygiene and sanitation and diet. But, on the other hand, our immune system has evolved to deal with day-to-day bacteria, and now that we live in this sort of semi-sterile environment our immune systems are not getting the stimulus they need at an early age.\" </p> <p> Man and other civilised animals are the only creatures that ever become dirty.<br><strong> From A Thousand-Mile Walk To The Gulf, by John Muir</strong> </p> <p>It's called the Hygiene Hypothesis, and it has been around for a while. In its crudest form - in newspaper headline terms - it says that dirt is good for you. But it is a little more complicated than that. Professor Graham Rook, an immunologist at University College London and one of the chief proponents of the hypothesis, explains: \"The thinking is that it's actually exposure to bacteria - particularly bacteria that have always been there throughout our evolutionary history - that is what turns on the immune system's regulatory path. We're just not getting exposed enough to these environmental bacteria any more. Living on concrete is not providing an input to the immune system which is actually required.\" </p> <p>More and more research such as that carried out in Avon is feeding into the hypothesis, says Rook. \"A Peruvian guy showed that, if you vacuum up the house dust in people's homes and then measure the amount of endotoxin in it - endotoxin is an easily measurable component of certain types of bacteria - you find that the more endotoxin there is, the less people are allergically sensitised to their house dust. In fact, all the epidemiology is now fitting this notion. There are several studies showing that, if you were brought up on a farm, you are less likely to be allergic. If you keep a dog - dogs go out and get covered in soil, then get wet and shake themselves around your house - you're less likely to be allergic.\" </p> <p>Rook believes the hypothesis applies not only to allergic responses such as asthma and eczema, but also to autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type one diabetes and inflammatory bowels diseases, all of which are becoming more common in the squeaky-clean northern hemisphere. </p> <p>In evolutionary terms, says Rook, it adds up. \"When oxygen first appeared on this planet, some organisms adapted to live with it, and of course oxygen is now a necessity. Similarly, we can read off in the human genome the influence of bacteria on it. These bugs have had an impact on us. Basically, for 99.9% of our evolution we were hunter-gatherers, and every time we felt thirsty we went to the waterhole like the hippos did, and basically we lived in mud. So soil organisms are very much a part of our physiology. </p> <p>\"But we can't go backwards. Obviously, hygiene and antibiotics are the two most useful things that have been achieved for mankind. What we do need to do is work out what we are no longer getting from the environment that we actually need, and then put it back. It could be put back in the food, it could be sprayed in the environment, we could have little inhalers, or we could make new vaccines. </p> <p>\"But I'm not sure that people need to alter their behaviour very much. We don't really want kids eating faeces and cat droppings. A little bit of garden soil doesn't do you any harm - in fact, it's good for you. The problem is that it depends on whether it's the bit of the garden soil that the neighbour's cat crapped on.\" </p> <p>Dirt, then, gets a clean bill of health. But drit is quite another matter. </p> <p>\u0095 For further help and information about obsessive-compulsive disorder, or to help sufferers by sending a donation, write to Obsessive Action, Aberdeen Centre, 22-24 Highbury Grove, London N5 2EA.

  "The time has come to face up to it: my birthday is on the horizon. To tell the truth, I have little time for birthdays; I don't really like the formality that often accompanies the celebration meal. Instead, my favourite form of dining is the long lunch that drifts on into evening. Companionship and great victuals are the real point of such gatherings, and, in an ideal world, they would occur at random and frequently throughout the year. <p>Mind you, when the boss told me that I could have anything at all for my birthday meal ... wow! Flights of fancy, such as caviar, Hollywood-style, came rushing to mind: as in Garbo as Anna Karenina, dipping into a great heap of ice-cooled sturgeon roe. \"What?\" I cried. \"Money no object?\" No, there's a cap of \u00a310 a head, came back the stern reply. Meanness itself. But perhaps it's better that way: the problem with such grandiose productions is that everything generally looks better on paper. Remember Babette's Feast? </p> <p>No, I would resist the dread words of \"theme\" and \"different\"; I'd just be myself, and cook a simple, elegant, robust meal, and hope for my favourite presents, a bottle of good fizz and an armload of cut flowers. Glad company, hearth and home would create the mise en sc\u00e8ne. </p> <p>So, what to begin with? A starter is a pivotal dish, critical in relaxing all into the meal, and therefore requires a great deal of consideration. While prepping in the restaurant, dwelling on this subject, in walked Mr Beale, a stout fellow with a twinkle in his eye and one of the ruddiest complexions I've ever seen. He was making his once-a-week delivery of the very best smoked eel, and it occurred to me that a dish of Beale's Eels' finest would do splendidly: sliced thinly, accompanied by crisp bacon, a really good poached egg and some horseradish to enliven the whole. </p> <p>Generally speaking, I prefer that a main course should be a dish of simplicity, with the principal ingredient - be that fish, meat, fowl or game - of the finest provenance, and cooked and accompanied in a manner that complements the raw material. That is, after all, the mark of all good cooking. The presentation should be without fuss or fanfare, letting the prime ingredient take its rightful place as the star of the meal. </p> <p>Well, it's a great theory, but what on earth was this dish fit for my birthday to be? It occurred to me that I rarely, if ever, eat veal these days. Sure, I have it on the menu at the restaurant, but its price is such (on account of the calves being hand-reared) that we can't afford to waste any of it, let alone allow any to slip off in the direction of the staff. So, veal is what I chose. The best veal dishes are Italian and, seeing as it is my birthday, a small taste of La Dolce Vita seems a perfectly reasonable request: cream sauces have been given a very bad press of late - of course, cream in every sauce in every meal is silly and lethal to a waistline and heart alike - but, every now and again, and cooked simply, a cream sauce is delicious. And when that sauce is charged with capers and anchovies and grappa et al and then spooned over a veal chop, it is very, very good indeed. </p> <p>I must confess to preferring no vegetables here, save for a few freshly gathered small potatoes, all waxy and delicious, and anointed with a little butter. In fact, I would prefer, instead, some really good cheese to have later on - a cracking good Cheddar or one of those dreamily creamy Irish cheeses, such as Durrus, with that patchy crust coloured varying hues of pink to beige, and the cheese itself all soft and yielding to the touch; or Cashel Blue, so rich and glorious. </p> <p>In the same manner as the devoted oenophile whose choice of wine will determine the choice of food, the ice cream I choose will determine the pudding to partner (in my book, ice cream is a must at any party). Coffee makes a great ice cream, one of the best in fact, yet it is all too rarely seen these days. Coffee ice cream with chocolate sauce is a very good combination; even better is coffee ice cream spooned into a chocolate souffl\u00e9 - a heavenly mix. </p> <p>The final, and most important, ingredient required to make this dinner special is the time to sit and enjoy the fruits of one's labours. </p> <p> All recipes serve six. </p> <p><b> Smoked eel salade - a wonderful composed salad. </b></p> <p> 600g smoked eel fillet </p> <p>12 rashers very good streaky bacon </p> <p>18 small waxy potatoes </p> <p>1 tbsp red-wine vinegar </p> <p>4 tbsp top-quality olive oil </p> <p>1 tsp chopped flat-leaf parsley </p> <p>1 tsp caster sugar </p> <p>1 tsp white-wine vinegar </p> <p>3 tbsp double cream </p> <p>1 dssp grated fresh horseradish </p> <p>Salt and pepper </p> <p>6 fresh free-range eggs </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Lay the rashers of bacon on a rack and cook them in the oven until crisp and well coloured. Scrub the potatoes clean, and boil them until cooked through. </p> <p>While they are still warm, peel the spuds and toss them in the red-wine vinegar, oil, salt and a little pepper. When they are cool, cut the potatoes into slices and toss with a little more oil and the parsley. </p> <p>Dissolve the caster sugar and a pinch of salt in the white-wine vinegar, then add the cream and horseradish (by all means up the quantity of horseradish if you like), and stir. </p> <p>Thinly slice the eel and set to one side. Set a pan of water on the cooker, and bring to the boil. Add a spoonful of white-wine vinegar, then crack the eggs into six small cups. Poach the eggs in their cups for three to four minutes, until the white is cooked and the yolk runny. Have to hand six plates, and on them pile all the ingredients one upon the other, starting with the potatoes and finishing with the bacon, and serve at once. </p> <p><b> Veal chop with ham, anchovies, capers and grappa - a splendid dish that is both simple and unusual. Also, it is not without a hint of La Dolce Vita, so it's ideal celebration food. It is worth noting that British veal is dark and extremely delicious. </b></p> <p> 2 tbsp capers </p> <p>6 good anchovy fillets </p> <p>160g thickly sliced boiled ham </p> <p>6 veal chops, around 2.5cms thick </p> <p>Vegetable oil, for frying </p> <p>Salt and pepper </p> <p>60g unsalted butter </p> <p>4 tbsp grappa </p> <p>6 tbsp whipping cream</p> <p>If the capers are salted, rinse them and then chop roughly. If they are preserved in vinegar, chop them roughly. Finely chop the anchovies and cut the ham into small cubes. Liberally pepper and lightly salt the veal. Heat a large, heavy-based frying pan and into it pour a thin layer of light oil. Gently lay the veal in the oil - do not cram the meat in the pan; if need be, do the chops in two or more batches or in two frying pans. Leave the chops to cook, undisturbed, until a rich, brown crust has formed on one side, about seven minutes or so. Turn over the chops, and repeat - do not fall prey to the temptation to prod or lift the meat in any way. Seven minutes on both sides will cook the veal to a splendid medium-rare (if you prefer it more or less well done, reduce or increase the cooking time accordingly). </p> <p>Transfer the chops to a warm dish. Add the butter to the pan, stir in the chopped anchovy until it has almost dissolved, then add the capers and ham, and stir to coat thoroughly. Tip in the grappa and, while it bubbles away, scrape up any residue adhering to the bottom of the pan. Stir in the cream, let it simmer for a bare minute, then set the veal on the dining plates and anoint each with sauce. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Chocolate souffle with coffee ice cream - having got your souffl\u00e9 (or, indeed, the individual souffl\u00e9s) to the table, break the crust and spoon in a generous helping of the ice cream. Eat swiftly, as it really is marvellous. The ice cream, from Elizabeth David's Italian Food, is the best recipe I know, and at its best churned just a few hours before eating (the custard for it can, however, be made the day before). You really need an ice-cream machine for this. </b> </p> <p>For the ice cream... </p> <p> 430ml cream </p> <p>A scratch of lemon zest </p> <p>110g freshly roasted coffee beans </p> <p>6 egg yolks </p> <p>110g sugar</p> <p>Set a pan of water on to boil. Take a bowl that will sit happily on the pot without touching the water and reduce the heat to a murmuring simmer. Put the cream, lemon zest, coffee beans and egg yolks in the bowl, and sit it upon the pot. Stir gently and steadily until the mixture thickens considerably. Remove the bowl from the heat, stir in the sugar, and leave to cool (upon a bowl of ice, if necessary). Churn according to the instructions of your ice-cream machine. </p> <p>For the souffl\u00e9... </p> <p>Butter </p> <p>100g plain chocolate </p> <p>2 tbsp strong coffee </p> <p>30g cornflour </p> <p>600ml milk </p> <p>60g sugar </p> <p>30g unsalted butter </p> <p>3 egg yolks </p> <p>5 egg whites </p> <p>1 tbsp sugar </p> <p>Icing sugar, for dusting</p> <p>Generously butter and lightly flour a souffl\u00e9 bowl (or six individual souffl\u00e9 moulds) and tie a collar(s) of greaseproof paper around it (or them). Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5, and move the shelf to the middle of the oven. </p> <p>Put the chocolate and coffee in a small bowl over a small pan of simmering water, and stir until melted and smooth. Slake the cornflour with three tablespoons of milk and, when you have a smooth paste, beat the rest of the milk along with the 60g sugar into the flour mix and tip into a saucepan. Bring to a boil over a high heat, remove from the flame and stir in the chocolate and coffee, scraping down all the mixture from the sides of the bowl. Dot the surface of the milk/chocolate mix with butter and leave to cool. </p> <p>In a scrupulously cleaned bowl, beat the egg whites until voluminous and peaked. Add a tablespoon of sugar and carry on beating until stiff. Scrape the chocolate mix into a separate bowl and beat in the egg yolks. Fold in first a quarter of the egg-white mixture, then the rest, a third at a time, taking care to maintain as much volume as possible. Pour the mixture into the mould(s). At this stage, the souffl\u00e9 mix can sit for several hours, lightly covered, until it is required. Remember, the dessert is best served straight from the oven. </p> <p>Bake for 35 minutes, then dust the top with icing sugar and cook for a further 10 minutes (individual souffl\u00e9s will take only 15-20 minutes). Insert a needle to check that the souffl\u00e9 is cooked through - and if it comes away clean, then you can be sure the souffl\u00e9 is done. </p> <p>To serve, crack the top of the souffl\u00e9 with a spoon and drop the ice cream within.

  "Fred, with whom I enjoyed an Umbrian dalliance, has dropped by and is being monopolised by my aged aunt, visiting lesbian, teenage daughter and ex-spouse. Perhaps it's just as well. I am incapacitated by conjunctivitis and a filling has dropped out, turning my mouth into a gasworks. Make coffee for six, but secretly longing for tea for two. Catch sight of my reflection in the wok, looming up like a pale balloon. The Millennium Domum. White elephants both. As I hand out mugs, Fred flashes me a smile that sizzles down my spine and liquefies my trainers. Reflect that, though misanthropic, I am at least homophilic. <p>\"And how's Panicale?\" I enquire, recalling the beautiful, haunted old hill town where we first dallied. </p> <p>\"Oh, Panicale!\" interrupts Alice. \"Saskia and I went there once. All the local men were playing a kind of boules - no women, obviously, they were all banged up indoors wrestling with tagliatelle.\" Alice can always trump me when it comes to Italy. She once had a cat called Cattiva and a dog called Dogma. She and Fred start to discuss the medieval city state. </p> <p>\"I've half a mind to do a study of the socio-sexual significance of town planning,\" threatens Alice. \"The Campo at Siena, say, is obviously a womb, and the tower's a phallus. Can't you just imagine the medieval dynasties bragging, 'Mine's bigger than yours!'\" </p> <p>Fred replies that Siena is obviously the most satisfying public arena in Europe. Well, he would, being bisexual. Harriet whispers, rather too loudly, \"I hate Alice! Fred's our friend and she's acting as if he's hers!\" </p> <p>Aunt murmurs, \"Dulcie, dearrr - could tannin cause spasms in the urrrethrrra?\" Ex-spouse is trying to pick up any frissons between Fred and me because, though he long ago stopped loving me, being jealous is a pleasure he wants to prolong into old age. </p> <p>The photos are produced. Fred is quite a serious photographer. Seem to recall he had quite a big apparatus. There are several photos of me looking moody with ravishing Italian landscapes in the background. \"My worrrd , Dulcie, you do look rrrelaxed !\" exclaims aunt, with more than a hint of Calvinist disapproval. Perhaps she has forgotten that ex-spouse and I have been divorced for years, and are merely living together as economic migrants. </p> <p>\"You look quite like the Mona Lisa,\" observes ex-spouse drily, \"except for your moustache.\" </p> <p>\"I shall kill Daddy in a minute!\" whispers Harriet. </p> <p>\"Do you know, Dulcie, you're starting to look like your mother,\" observes Alice. </p> <p>\"I shall kill Alice, too,\" whispers Harriet. </p> <p>\"Oh, no,\" drawls ex-spouse, \"she's a lot fatter than her mother ever was.\" </p> <p>\"I can't comment, of course, on Dulcie's likeness to her mother,\" observes Fred diplomatically. \"I see her more as a Titian Venus.\" This, understandably, silences everyone for an instant. A Titian Venus! I shall love him forever! Not that I can recollect any of Titian's Venuses in detail, but at my age any Venus will do. \"That reminds me, dearrr,\" ponders aunt after a few seconds, \"I need to go to the optician.\" </p> <p>\"Sounds as if Fred should go with you,\" sneers ex. </p> <p>\"Oh Gordon!\" snaps Alice. \"I don't know which is worse, Fred's soft soap or your sour grapes.\" </p> <p>\"To add a dash of sheer cheek,\" says Fred, with the air of one taking a risk, \"I was wondering if you could put me up, Dulcie, but you've obviously got a houseful.\" </p> <p>\"Oh no!\" I cry. \"Of course we can! Harriet can come in with me and you can have her bed!\" </p> <p>Much later, Fred and I find ourselves alone in the kitchen for a split-second. \"I don't suppose,\" he whispers, \"you could creep into my little single bed in the middle of the night?\" I shake my head. Apart from my bad breath and conjunctivitis, I can't face nocturnal high jinks in the bosom of my family. Sharing a single bed in middle age is somehow not fitting. </p> <p>Did he really want to? Or was he just stirring? I sometimes think Fred has got a secret agenda. </p> <p>At dawn, I hear someone stirring down in the kitchen. Assume it is Fred. Am confronted, however, with Great Aunt Elspeth making a cup of cocoa. \"I think that man who came yesterrrday has designs on you, dearrr ,\" she warns. \" Therrre's something a little bit queerrr about him, if you ask me.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the Westbeth studio in Greenwich Village, a vast, iron-beamed space with radiant views of New York city streaming in through every window, the Merce Cunningham Company is warming up for the day's rehearsals. Wearing threadbare tights and woolly leg-warmers, the dancers put their limber bodies through the usual paces, slowly stretching in great, arching steps that seem to consume an acre of floor-space, shaking out their joints in splashes of muscle and grace. </p> <p>It takes a little while to notice, tucked away in one corner behind a raised platform, the old man sitting at his table, \"dreaming up steps\". Looking up nervously now and then, he scribbles away in a note-pad, twisting tiny stick-figures into odd, off-kilter shapes, right until the moment when the rehearsal is scheduled to begin. Then he puts the paper to one side and raises himself from the chair, a tortuous process that seems to take over a minute. </p> <p>Only when he takes his first, halting steps is it possible to see the full harrowing extent of his infirmity: one leg delicate, a little bowed, the other collapsed, crumpled like a parody of one of his contorted line drawings. With great effort, he drags himself over to a barre that runs the length of the room and, his buckled feet scraping the floor, uses it to pull himself along. Only when he has neared the end of his agonising journey, do the lithe, young bodies cease their exercises and stand to attention. </p> <p>\"What a beautiful morning,\" he announces, in a shaking, barely audible voice. \"It was this kind of day - bright and sunny and clear - when I landed in New York for the first time and I thought: 'Oh boy, this is it'. Great things could happen here.\" He then pauses, surveys the dancers for a moment and smiles: \"All right then, let's begin...\" </p> <p>Merce Cunningham is, without doubt, the world's greatest living choreographer. His name stands alongside Martha Graham and George Balanchine in the pantheon of mercurial figures that transformed 20th century dance, though his work arguably reaches further and deeper, celebrating sheer movement for its own stark, austere sake. \"He's just continued to astound people and stay outside of any fashion or polemic,\" says fellow choreographer Bill T Jones, \"Merce is the champion of the struggle to say that dance is it's own primary language.\" </p> <p>At the height of his powers, Cunningham was also a peerless performer. His ability to launch himself into the air was legendary, often drawing gasps from the audience, most famously in the celebrated scene in Martha Graham's Letter To The World in 1940 when, to the cue of Graham's \"Dear March, come in,\" the young Cunningham, in top hat and tails, would bound across the stage. However, it was through his own, eccentric choreography that his feral radiance really shone: \"He never moved like anybody else in the company,\" says Marianne Simon, a Cunningham troupe member, \"he looked not like a man, but like a gazelle or a lily blooming in the field.\" </p> <p>His genius was like a force of nature, sending unlikely jolting, shuddering ripples through his arms and pelvis and legs. Some say, \"he was an animal\". And it's easy to see why, in pieces such as the startling 1960 work Crises, with its darting, shifting solo, outstretched one moment, spastic and convulsive the next or in the finale of Place, where Cunningham gave one of his most disturbing performances, thrashing around wildly inside a transparent plastic sack. </p> <p>Even at the end of his career - he performed later than anyone bar Graham herself - just a flicker of his boney hands could radiate a tremendous energy: \"I remember watching a new solo of his, and he is crawling around the floor and doing all kinds of crazy things,\" says Remy Charlip, who danced with the Cunningham company for its first 11 years, \"and it was like looking into his psyche. I thought he was having a fit and I remember saying: \"He's not going to do that on stage, is he? He can't do that in public?\" </p> <p>This same naturally iconoclastic spirit also shaped the radical approach of this choreography. With his partner and mentor, the composer John Cage, Cunningham dreamt up some of the most radical and sometimes downright perverse performance notions of the 20th century: flipping coins or throwing dice to decide the structure of pieces; wilfully destroying the time-honoured bond between dance and music. </p> <p>In the field of modern dance, these ideas would eventually influence Twyla Tharp, Richard Alston and Siobhan Davies. Cunningham would also have an enormous impact on other creative fields, on experimental theatre practitioners such as Robert Wilson and choreographer/director Meredith Monk. It is no surprise that one of theatre's greatest innovators is numbered among his earliest supporters: \"Cunningham's group is in the tradition of Martha Graham in many ways, but in one most of all,\" wrote Peter Brook in 1964. \"The very things that are criticised, laughed at and ignored, will only a few months later be imitated everywhere.\" </p> <p>By all accounts, Cunningham has mellowed considerably. With his halo of untidy white curls, he now comes across as a delightfully charming, easy-mannered, quaintly old-fashioned elderly gentleman, who repeats his well-worn anecdotes with the confidence of someone who knows his word is now creed. The debilitating arthritis and chronic hip condition that finally forced him off the stage in his early 70s gives his body a brittle, almost translucent quality. However, he transcends his frailty with an open smile and a decidedly unpretentious wit. </p> <p>But as long-time members and associates of the company will openly testify, this wasn't always the case. Right up until the death in 1992 of his partner John Cage, who had run much of company life, organised tours, even mediated in disputes with dancers, Cunningham was often an aloof, cold, difficult and demanding presence: \"He would have these sort of black moods when you couldn't get through to him at all,\" remembers David Vaughan, original company manager and now company archivist. \"When I started to work with him, on some days I would feel it was like walking into this completely impenetrable wall around him. We all felt that.\" Some have even gone so far as to assert that the same caprice and obsessiveness that made the work great also led him to take dangerous risks, both with himself and with his dancers: \"Of course, he crippled himself by doing some of these wild things,\" says one company member. \"He did a dance where people were like twisting and torqueing and spiralling their bodies. The company used to call it 'whiplash'.\" </p> <p>Cunningham is also protective of his personal life, and his relationship with Cage still remains one of the great enigmas of the avant-garde. The blank canvas meticulously maintained by both has allowed detractors to paint a picture of the loquacious Cage as \"Svengali\", feeding ideas and theories to his younger, more taciturn prot\u00e9g\u00e9. And while neither denied the fact of his romantic attachment, it had remained until now unfurnished with even the most rudimentary details: \"I do the cooking,\" Cage commented wryly, when pressed once by a gay activist for a few morsels of information, \"and Merce does the dishes.\" Little more than this has ever been divulged before, either in Cage's biography or in the voluminous press coverage of Cunningham. </p> <p>However, it would appear that there was considerably more to their union, which seems to have been marked by affairs with male dancers in the company. At least once they shared the affections of the same young dancer. It is possibly the fundamentally fraught and complex nature of their 50-year relationship - and not, as is often cited, lingering fear from the beginning of their time together, when homosexuality was still an offence punishable by law -that continues to fuel Cunningham's silence in this relatively open-minded era: \"I don't think I was guarded about my personal life,\" he says gently, \"It is quite true I didn't speak about it very much but I didn't see any reason to speak about it. John and I were together. We did our work together. We travelled together. What more is there to say?\" </p> <p>Mercier Philip Cunningham was born in the small lumber town of Centralia, Washington on April 16 1919, the third son of Clifford Cunningham, a lawyer of Irish descent, and Mayme Joach, a teacher. From a young age, Mercier displayed a gregarious streak that marked him out, as he lightheartedly puts it, as the \"criminal\" among a family of lawyers: \"He liked the beach and beach business - the sand and all kind of captured his attention, whirling around in it,\" says his older brother Dorwin, a retired lawyer who still lives in Washington State. \"And if the circus came to town, when they would be going through the streets, I remember Merce would get up and do sort of a dance, just as a youngster would.\" </p> <p>At 12 he began studying tap-dancing with a former vaudeville and circus performer named Mrs Barrett, who ran an improvised local academy. After he left high school, Mercier made a half-hearted attempt to study at the George Washington University in Washington DC, taking literature and theatre history courses. Dorwin, who was studying law in DC, kept a journal of this time: \"We ate out and Swords [their flatmate] complained about the expenses,\" he reads falteringly from the entry for October 11 1936. \"Then Mercier arrives, bubbling over with enthusiasm after seeing the Jooss ballet in the National Theatre. Such interest as his must be the first outward signs of latent genius.\" </p> <p>However, Mercier only lasted one semester at university, enrolling instead at the Cornish School for Performing and Visual Arts in Seattle, an astonishing stroke of good fortune that would transform his life. First he got himself into the 8am dance class of Bonnie Bird, an ex-Martha Graham dancer, who would prove a formative influence. Then, during his second year there, a 27-year-old composer named John Cage was employed as rehearsal pianist, relocating from California with his wife Xenia Kashevaroff. Cage had studied composition under Schoenberg and already had something of a radical, iconoclastic outlook: \"He started a percussion programme,\" says Cunningham, \"and once I had mastered the piece, he came and said 'You were playing everything absolutely perfectly. Now just go a little further and make a few mistakes.' I thought 'that is a marvellous idea'.\" </p> <p>At the end of his second year at Cornish, in the summer of '39, Cunningham hitch-hiked to Mills College in California where the Bennington School of the Dance was holding its summer school, with tutorials run by famous figures such as Charles Weidman, Hanya Holm and Martha Graham. \"I didn't know anything about her [Graham]; I had never seen her dance,\" Cunningham admits, \"I think that she conducted the last two weeks and I remember this woman who was really small, compared to myself. But such a force.\" </p> <p> Young Mercier also made an instant impression on Graham, who offered him a place in her company if he came to New York. He immediately travelled back to Centralia to break the news to his parents: \"My mother's face fell. But my father, who was a very bright intelligent man, he looked at me and he looked at her and then he said: 'Oh, let him go. He's going to go anyway.' And so I went.\" After three days on a train, Cunningham arrived in New York on a sunny late-summer day in 1939: \"I stepped onto the pavement and I said 'This is home'. It was immediate.\" He then made his way to the the Martha Graham Studio: \"Before classes began, I walked in the door. She was standing there and she said: 'Oh! I didn't think you'd come.' I didn't say it but I thought to myself: 'Lady, you don't know me'.\" </p> <p>That season Graham was beginning work on her landmark work Every Soul Is A Circus, and she cast Cunningham in one of the lead male roles: \"I thought that was wonderful. I get to be dancing. It wasn't until the performances I suddenly thought: 'Oh, I 'm performing on Broadway in New York.' It was really quite a remarkable feeling.\" </p> <p>As Graham company member, Nina Fonaroff - now 86 - recalls: \"As a person he was enticing. He was a Puck - irresistible, and very funny too. And as a dancer he was a phenomenon, absolutely extraor dinary. And he had such passion for it. I remember in Circus, when he made his debut, he had on these pink tights and a pink top, and his heart was beating so hard you could practically see it thumping with excitement.\" </p> <p>Cunningham, who by now had shortened his first name to Merce, went on to dance lead roles in El Penitente (where he played Christ) and Letter To The World, a piece based on Emily Dickinson's poetry. Graham's relatively narrative-based approach couldn't contain or satisfy Cunningham, who by the end of this time with the company, was already choreographing his own pieces: \"I remember one day he came bouncing up saying, 'I have a dance, I have a dance. Come see, come see'.\" says Fonaroff. \"And so I followed him into the studio and he did this thing, almost walking on his knees and jumping up and down. It was called Totem Ancestor. I'd never seen anything like it.\" </p> <p>The real catalyst for Cunning ham's break with the Graham company was the arrival of John Cage who had moved to New York with his wife Xenia in the summer of 1942. Cage wrote the music for their first solo programme in 1944, which included Totem Ancestor, a solo called Root Of An Unfocus, and Tossed As It Is Untroubled, inspired by Joyce's Finnegans Wake: \"I date my beginning from this concert\", Cunningham says. </p> <p>During rehearsals, Cage and Cunningham also formulated one of their most fundamental tenets: the separation of music and dance. \"We could agree on a common structure for a particular dance and John could compose to that structure and I could choreograph. In the beginning, there were points in that structure where the music and dance came together. But later we abandoned that and made them entirely independent.\" By the early 50s, at the instigation of Cage, Cunningham began to use \"chance operations\" to formulate the ele ments of his pieces, particularly in the key 1952 piece Suite By Chance: \"The individual sequences, and the length of time, and the directions in space were discovered by tossing coins,\" he says. </p> <p>Many of these ideas were tested and developed not only through Cunningham's occasional performances but also through the famous summer sessions at the celebrated Black Mountain College, North Carolina, where in 1952 Cunningham and Cage masterminded the world's first \"Happening\". That summer in Black Mountain also saw the birth of \"Merce Cunningham and Dance Company\", a startling ensemble of dancers such as Carolyn Brown, Viola Farber, Jo-Anne Melsher and Remy Charlip which, over the next few years, would give form to some of Cunningham's ground- breaking works: 1953's Septet, where a still, balletic style is positioned next to the music of Eric Satie, and Minutiae in 1954, which marks the beginning of Robert Rauschenberg's 10-year stint as resident designer. </p> <p>However, it is not just for the quality of the work that the dancers still nostalgically refer to this early period as the Golden Age, but also because of the distinctive company spirit, forged by communal hardships. Reviews were almost universally negative: \"His dance language is for the initiated few who are as interested in contemplating Mr Cunningham's navel as he is himself,\" Dance Magazine said in 1953. \"Have a little Mercy, Merce,\" a later headline would proclaim. </p> <p>But diatribes did little more than steel a curiously robust sense of mission, as the company toured their pieces in a clapped-out Volkswagen bus, often driving inordinate distances for a single performance and playing to meagre audiences: \"It took exactly nine people and a ton of luggage,\" remembers dancer Carolyn Brown. \"We sometimes drove all day and into the wee hours. I remember giving a performance without sleeping at all. But it really was a lot of fun. </p> <p>\"John was a wonderful leader. He and [composer] David Tudor would get into these wonderful conversations. Meanwhile, Merce would be very quiet and study Russian and read or knit. The rest of us would play games. It just was a great time to develop a real company because we were so close together.\" </p> <p>By this time, the relationship between Cunningham and Cage was deeply personal as well as inextricably professional. Prior to this involvement, Cunningham appears to have conducted predominantly heterosexual relationships, both during his time with the Martha Graham company - when he was deeply attached to a Bennington theatre student - and earlier at the Cornish school, when he went out with a dance student named Joyce Holder. </p> <p>\"We were very close but it was always ambiguous,\" Holder recalls. \"I was a little wild and was having many flings. I think that one of the attractions for Merce was that my other boyfriends could take him around in their cars if he needed to go someplace.\" Then, when Holder followed him to New York, she witnessed the formation of the Cage/Cunningham bond in 1942: \"Merce would always hint to me that it was very valuable for his work. Music parts drove him crazy and John composing for him solved that problem. His implication to me always was that their relationship was mutually advantageous on that level.\" </p> <p>Equally indistinct was the nature of the union itself, which remained clandestine for decades: \"I didn't have any inkling,\" says Marianne Simon, who left the company in 1958, \"and I don't think I was alone in that among the female dancers. We were all madly in love with [Merce] in those early days.\" </p> <p> From an early stage, however, there were affairs with young male dancers in the company: \"It was and it wasn't [an open relationship],\" says one of early dancers, who was close to both men, \"it was kind of secretive and at the same time they both slept with other people. Later on, Merce took up with a younger dancer in the company who did not want John to come on tour any more, and that was crushing to John because he built that company. John got all the dates and wrote all of the letters anddrove and cooked and made all the arrangements.\" </p> <p>At times it seems to have been precisely this dominance that Cunningham was struggling against, both in his affairs and in his general behaviour: \"John was the brains and Merce was the body,\" continues the same troupe member. \"Merce couldn't really protect himself, so he would do things like hide in a room for a week and wouldn't come out and wouldn't eat. John would get frantic. That was his way of dealing with John.\" </p> <p>Yet, if Cunningham really did worry that his work would never be fully appreciated and would always remain in Cage's shadow, grounds for at least some of his fears would evaporate in the pivotal year of 1964. Tiring of New York's indifference, the company decided to tour Europe and Asia to showcase some of their strongest work: Winterbranch, a relentless piece based on the theme of falling, featuring La Monte Young's stereophonic buzzsaw soundtrack; Story, which involved scrap remade by Rauschenberg from whatever junk was lying around the theatre; and Crises, in which the dancers were bound by giant elastic bands. </p> <p>At the first major stopover, Paris, they met a familiar reaction: \"People threw things at us,\" Carolyn Brown recalls, \"eggs and tomatoes. During the interval they went out to get more.\" During the Venice dates, things began to pick up; the press reception was respectful and Rauschenberg picked up first prize at the Bienniale art show. However, by the time they reached London, the Merce Cunningham company was being hailed as a sensation: \"At a blow, ballet has been brought right up in line with the front-rank experiments in the other arts,\" raved Alexander Bland in the Observer, \"something which has hardly happened since the days of Diaghilev. Here is heart-warming proof that it is an art with a future, opening up ranges of possibilities which stretch out of sight.\" </p> <p>After an initial scintillating run at Sadler's Wells, attended by everyone from Frederick Ashton to Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev, they transferred for an equally triumphant three-week run at the Phoenix: \"Merce was really quite astonished. In New York, the most he'd ever played was two nights,\" recalls Michael White, who produced the London leg of the tour. </p> <p>The tour proceeded in a rather chaotic fashion through Scandinavia, onward to Prague (where the posters trumpeted dances \"in the style of West Side Story\") and Poland, and then further east to Bombay. By the time they reached Japan, the strain was beginning to tell, with tensions particularly clamorous between Cage and Cunningham on the one hand and on the other between them and Rauschenberg, who had made the mistake of becoming far too famous in the wake of his Venice conquest. </p> <p>After the general critical success of the tour, and particularly the rapture of the London reviewers, subsequently reported in the US press, the entire character of the company changed. While the controversy, the sporadic booing and walkouts, and the financial crises would continue for some decades yet, the critical climate became infinitely more favourable, the company grew in size and professionalism, and Cunningham him self began a steady upward trajectory towards avant garde canonisation. </p> <p>The latter half of the 60s saw further Cunningham highlights, notably 1968's Walkaround Time, which employed sets based on Marcel Duchamp's Large Glass, and the stunning piece Rainforest, also in the same year, strewn with Andy Warhol's helium-filled pillows. In the 70s and early 80s, alongside the video artist Charles Atlas, Cunningham coopted video techniques in pieces such as 1975's Blue Studio: Five Segments, and Channel/Inserts in 1981. </p> <p>By the early 90s Cunningham's physical condition was beginning to severely restrict how much he could perform or even demonstrate to the dancers, and he turned to computer technology, devising ever more ingeniously abstract and random steps using a computer program called LifeForms. Still on the cutting edge at the age of 81, he has taken this a step forward in a work called Biped, which uses state of the art Motion Capture technology to record the movements of his dancers and reproduce them as computer animations within the dance. As audiences at London's Barbican will discover next week, the piece, featuring the music of Gavin Bryars, is mesmerising, the ultimate combination of art and technology. </p> <p>The main event during this latest period of Cunningham's work and life was, of course, the death of Cage in August 1992. After returning from the New York studio to their Sixth Avenue apartment, Cunningham discovered him collapsed on the kitchen floor, having suffered a stroke. Despite the many difficulties in their relationship, the two men had been, according to Cage's assistant Laura Kuhn, \"very affectionate\" in their final years together, openly so perhaps for the first time, now that neither had anything left to prove. </p> <p>The loss of Cage would shatter a dynamic established over half a century: \"Because John answered the questions so brilliantly, I kept my mouth shut. But suddenly he was not around to do it. And so I was forced to speak.\" Most tellingly, however, Cunningham was back in the studio the day after Cage's death: \"I decided quite quickly: 'Well, John is dead, there is nothing I can do about that, and I'm just going to go on.' I thought about it. I would find my own solution.\" </p> <p>That solution was of course, the work - the force that had sustained and nourished their relationship, made sense of the affairs and the infidelities, smoothed over the petty jealousies. Cunningham's obsession with his work was also the force that drove him, perhaps, to take risks with his body, to continue performing long after it was wise, to demand - and often get - the impossible from his dancers, to push his choreography beyond the bounds of what was thought possible. </p> <p>\"You have to love dancing to stick to it,\" he has written, \"It gives nothing back, no manuscripts to store away, no paintings to show on walls and maybe hang in museums, no poems to be printed and sold, nothing but that single fleeting moment when you feel alive.

  "<p>Linda Fiorentino can be fierce (The Last Seduction), freaky (Martin Scorsese's After Hours) and even, occasionally, financially viable (Men In Black). But no matter what screen persona she inhabits, she is almost always memorable and invariably quite funny. She's all that and more in her latest movie Where The Money Is, as a smalltown nursing home attendant intrigued by her latest charge, Paul Newman, whom she uses to scheme her way out of her dead-end life. Forty, unmarried and close to her seven brothers and sisters, the Philadelphia-raised actress is somewhat more satisfied with her own life. And whatever isn't right about it, well, at least it's good for a laugh.</p> <p><strong>Was there any trepidation about making a movie with a legend like Paul Newman?</strong></p> <p>Actually, it's such hard work that there isn't time to think that way. Plus, I knew that if I thought that way early on that I would not have been able to work. But while I was watching the film for the first time, about halfway through I started shaking and almost fell off my chair. My friend who was there with me said, \"What's wrong? It's not bad, it's pretty good.\" And I said, \"No, it's that I did a movie with Paul Newman!\" That was the first time that it occurred to me. </p> <p><strong>What was the experience of working with him like?</strong></p> <p>He's such a normal guy. He doesn't think of himself as a movie star or icon; he just wants to get home and go to sleep, I think, like me. That's mostly what you think about when you're working. He is a little hustler, though, pardon the pun. He likes to pretend that he isn't good at certain sports like ping-pong or badminton, and then he kills everyone. His hand-eye coordination is amazing. And he's going to be sexy to his last breath, that man.</p> <p><strong>Speaking of which, what did it feel like to lap dance for him and not get any response at all?</strong></p> <p>It was the challenge of the piece. But isn't that also the female fantasy, being in total control of the situation? I mean, all men should be in comas when we make love to them; some of them are.</p> <p><strong>Are you attracted to playing dangerous women?</strong></p> <p>I'm not so sure I'm attracted to dangerous women as people are attracted to me playing those parts. But maybe I'm a thrill-seeker of sorts. I grew up in a large family, so there was a lot of competition to be the best, the prettiest and the smartest. So, that's probably where I learned everything I needed to do what I do in the movies.</p> <p><strong>Didn't you originally intend to be a lawyer?</strong></p> <p>Yes; my degree is in political science. I was heading to law school and my political philosophy teacher talked me out of it and told me to become an actress.</p> <p><strong>So now that it's paid off, how do you keep your feet on the ground?</strong> </p> <p>I have really big feet, so that helps. I don't live in LA, I live in New York, and that's a major thing that keeps me stable. The people closest to me are not Hollywood types, they're friends and family. My sisters are my best friends; I've been really lucky to have them. </p> <p><strong>You seem to have a love/hate thing going with this business.</strong></p> <p>It's not love/hate; the business aspect is just pure hate! I love what it has afforded me in terms of experiences and excitement and money, and the people I've met and the work I've done. But I find many of the people in this business to be cruel, I find them uninteresting, I find them vain; I just would rather think of it as my job and not my life.</p>",
  "<p>Newcastle last night agreed a \u00a31.75m deal to sign the Chile midfielder Clarence Acuna. The 25-year-old had faxed St James' Park confirming he had agreed personal terms of a four-year deal and is now awaiting a work permit. </p> <p>Acuna has just completed a month-long suspension imposed by Fifa after he was found to have taken a banned substance, an offence he has vehemently denied. </p> <p>He impressed Bobby Robson on trial last month but the deal came close to collapsing when the Newcastle manager failed to reach an early agreement with the players representatives and his Santiago club, the University of Chile. </p> <p>Chelsea have made a \u00a33m bid for Deportivo La Coruna's Yugoslavia midfielder Savisa Jokanovic, according to the Spanish press. The 32-year-old, a former Partizan Belgrade, Oviedo and Tenerife player, has struggled to hold down a first-team place with the Spanish champions. </p> <p>Talks in Zurich aimed at finding an alternative to the transfer system have hit trouble with the deadline for a solution less than a month away. And afterwards the Transfer Taskforce, comprising representatives of Fifa, Uefa, Europe's professional leagues and their players, fired a broadside at the European game's ruling body. </p> <p>The players' representative, Gordon Taylor, accused fellow Taskforce members of stalling tactics in an attempt to keep the current system in place. </p> <p>Taylor plans to meet the EC's Competitions' Commissioner Mario Monti in Brussels next week to express his concerns. The EC has already said that if the authorities fail to come up with an alternative system that falls in line with the Treaty of Rome's provisions on the free movement of labour, it will abolish transfer fees. </p> <p>That would throw the game into chaos, but it is a distinct possibility if Taylor's fears are founded. </p> <p>After the meeting chaired by the Fifa president Sepp Blatter, the international players' union FIFPro, of which Taylor is chairman, said in a statement: \"After several working sessions [of the Taskforce] and very long discussions, FIFPro has come to the conclusion that Uefa and the professional leagues have only one objective - namely gaining time and retaining the present system at any cost.\" </p> <p>The statement added that FIFPro will participate in one last Taskforce meeting next Thursday but added it did so \"more in hope than expectation\" of finding an answer. </p> <p>\"We refute the suggestion that we have dragged our feet,\" retorted Uefa's Mike Lee. \"We have only been fully involved since the beginning of September. Other forces seem to be at play within FIFPro which seem intent on stopping this from happening. </p> <p>\"We believe that there is still an opportunity for a positive solution that works for football and is considered to be within European law. But this is not an easy solution to find.\"</p>",
  "<p>This week it has emerged that a small UK-listed company claiming to be the victim of bulletin board market manipulation is taking legal action against the chat room user who posted the rumours. </p> <p>This news will send shivers down the spines of all web sites, ISPs and bulletin board operators, who are nervous in the extreme about libel and the net. The attitude is understandable; the laws surrounding internet regulation are nebulous to non-existent and any case law has international implications. </p> <p>In this case, the threatened legal action is over negative information posted about its overseas operations. The share price shot down. The company in question says the information was completely incorrect. </p> <p>So, just how can the private investor verify the contents of the many regulated, and unregulated, financial cyber lounges? The simple answer is that they cannot, and the Financial Services Authority in March issued a warning to this effect. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Motley Fool site, which operates over a thousand bulletin boards, argues the financial chatrooms tend to be self-regulating. \"If someone posts an incorrect comment, generally the rest of the community will react quickly and clamp down on it. It's a bit like turning up at a dinner party when everyone is having a serious discussion and you come in with a silly comment. You will quickly be told to keep quiet.\" </p> <p>He adds that the Motley Fool has created a philosophy of genuine interest in long-term investing and that people who sign up to the board also sign up to this community. </p> <p>Motley Fool does, however, employ 12 people whose sole role is to monitor the boards. They are automatically alerted every time someone clicks on the \"problem post\" link. The spokesman says that not every post will automatically be removed, but it will be investigated. Similarly, Hemscott employs a compliance officer, part of whose job is to check for dodgy board entries. </p> <p>In August, interactive investor international (iii) introduced a requirement for all participants in discussions to submit their email address before posting. The address is verified by sending an email containing a link which must be clicked before the person can contribute to the board, meaning posters using hotmail or even internet cafes, can be tracked. </p> <p>The FSA and the Stock Exchange monitor the boards on an even more sporadic basis, although this will become more formalised next year once the Financial Services Market Act comes into effect. </p> <p>If legal action were to be brought against the board providers, it would use the defence of \"innocent disseminator\": in other words, there is no way that it can effectively monitor everything that is being written, but what the individual posters should remember is that unless you are qualified to do so, giving financial advice -such as tipping shares - is a criminal offence and perpetrators could be imprisoned for up to seven years. </p> <p>A London company called IBNet is about to start marketing software which monitors all mention of a specific company anywhere on the internet. The CEO, Mark Ommanney, says the product is a result of his own company's experience of fallacious comment that its shares had been suspended. </p> <p>\"The post was on iii and purported to be sourced from an article in the Evening Standard. I checked, and there was no such article, so I called my broker to check whether or not it was true. It wasn't, so my next action was to call my PR company. A message was posted on the same board to say that the rumour was not true, and fortunately, this quashed all discussion of the issue,\" he says. </p> <p>He adds that while the iii monitoring service works - allowing people who are unhappy with the contents of a board discussion to appeal directly to iii to have it thrown off site - he felt it was better to counter rumour with truth, rather than having the original posting removed. </p> <p>A spokesman for iii says: \"The boards form an important component for discussion and the potentially libellous information is very much the exception and not the rule.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year Scoot, the online information directory, found confidential company information was being leaked onto various boards, including iii. A court order was issued and the boards were forced to hand over email addresses of the posters. </p> <p>Paul Carratu runs a detective agency offering a dot.com monitoring service. His clients tend to operate in sensitive areas. He watches UK and international financial bulletin boards and gen- eral chat rooms for mention of the client which is suspic-ious, controversial or wrong. </p> <p>\"Nine times out of 10 we don't know ourselves whether or not the information is misleading, so we just pass it to the company to investigate,\" he says.</p>",
  "<p>An attempt by a taxpayer to use the Human Rights Act to show they had been refused a fair hearing in a dispute with the Inland Revenue failed in the High Court this week. </p> <p>The European Convention on Human Rights was incorporated into UK law on October 2 with the aim of guaranteeing basic rights, including the right to a fair trial. </p> <p>Patrick Cullinane, bankrupted by the Revenue four years ago, said the act stated he had a right to be represented in court and should be able to choose a friend rather than conduct his case against the Revenue himself. </p> <p>Mr Cullinane's friend, Neil Woodward, told the court that Mr Cullinane could not afford to pay for a solicitor to represent him and had failed to gain legal aid. He said Mr Cullinane was dyslexic and didn't feel confident arguing against the Revenue's barris ter, who had been drafted in to replace the tax agency's in-house lawyer only a few days before the case opened at a cost of \u00a31,600 per day. </p> <p>Instead, Mr Cullinane asked Mr Woodward, who is also involved in a dispute with the Revenue, to represent him, something he had done at two previous appeals against Mr Cullinane's bankruptcy without challenge. </p> <p>But the Revenue successfully argued that Mr Cullinane and Mr Woodward should be considered \"vexatious litigants\" who were bringing a series of \"hopeless\" cases that needed the sanction of a qualified lawyer before the court would hear further complaints. Mr Cullinane was forced to drop his \"litigation friend\" after the court backed the Revenue. He was refused leave to appeal. </p> <p>Mr Justice Ferris, presiding over the case, also said friends could only be used as advocates in \"exceptional circumstances\" and in his view this was not an exceptional case. He gave Mr Cullinane three weeks to find a lawyer. </p> <p>But Mr Justice Ferris confessed during the debate to knowing little of how the Human Rights Act affected the case and relied instead on research put forward by the Revenue's barrister. Independent advice on the implications of the Act were not sought by the judge. </p> <p>Mr Cullinane went to court last week to force the Revenue to produce his tax file. He says he was forced to do so after the Revenue refused to let him see it. \"I offered to pay administration costs, but they still said no,\" he says. \"That was the only reason we were in court. Not to talk about who should represent me.\" </p> <p>\"Why doesn't the Revenue want Patrick to see his file? We think it is a deliberate attempt to cover up mistakes,\" says Mr Woodward. </p> <p>The Revenue told Jobs &amp; Money this week that tax files are released at its discretion and \"each case is dealt with on its merits\". The \"open government\" regulations IR141 that govern the Revenue state that officers can withold information \"where it would prejudice the assessment or collection of tax or assist tax avoidance or evasion\". They can also prevent taxpayers seeing their records if they \"undermine good management or affect the confidential nature of internal discussion and advice\". Mr Cullinane says the Revenue refuses to give him a reason for withholding his file. </p> <p>Last year Mr Woodward forced the Revenue to admit it wrongfully bankrupted him. He won his case after forcing the tax agency to disclose his tax file. The file revealed that taxes claimed by the Revenue were less than the tax relief he was owed. He is now pursuing a \u00a33m compensation claim. </p> <p>Mr Cullinane, 50, whose case was highlighted in last week's Jobs &amp; Money, says he has been fighting off claims from the Revenue that he owed tax from self-employment and renting rooms in his house since 1984. The Revenue began investigating his case after he made a claim for overpayed tax following a period as a film studio stagehand on an emergency tax code. </p> <p>He says he has a continuous tax record that shows he was taxed at source through PAYE and didn't generate any self-employed income. He denies he rented rooms in his house at any time. But the Revenue won a bankruptcy order in 1996 after it alleged he owed nearly \u00a340,000 and in 1998 seized his home.</p>",
  "<p>Marks &amp; Spencer's Libran Scales (28 September 1894) are tipped out of balance as it struggles to modernise its management, marketing and old-fashioned image. </p> <p>Trouble has been brewing for years, but a turning point came in August 1999 when the sun's eclipse blotted out the Part of Fortune, a traditionally lucky point, in the financial zone of its horoscope. This was followed by violent oppositions to this point from innovative Uranus, but Marks &amp; Spencer has over-reacted to the demand for change and appears to be spinning out of control.</p> <p>The astrology looks brighter than current appearances suggest and if M&amp;S gets a new CEO there is a good chance it will turn the corner. Its biggest astrological influence in 2001 is when relationship Venus progresses to its horizon in February, and that could symbolise a takeover, merger or new partnership.</p> <p>In this broader context, M&amp;S's first major advertising campaign, run by Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe/YR and launched on September 8, may be neither here nor there. In choosing it to run the campaign, M&amp;S has the right instinct because this young, colourful agency is a creative Leo (August 10 1993) with its sun exactly on the M&amp;S Part of Fortune. The brief came in on lucky Jupiter, but with Uranus involved, we can hazard a guess that it has also sown the seeds of a future split in the Rainey Kelly team.</p> <p>The campaign aims to ditch the staid image and introduce a new sizing initiative. Like Uranus, this breaks convention, but who is the size 16 woman, running uphill, flinging off her clothes and shouting \"I am normal\"? She is Marks &amp; Spencer itself, in wild disarray and in an uphill struggle to get back to normal.</p> <p>The astrology for the day of the first ad suggests which images will work and which will bomb. The M&amp;S Moon has moved into Leo, crossing its Ascendant. A woman showing herself off fits a theatrical Leo Moon, but the \"Exclusively for Everyone\" strapline doesn't quite capture the symbolism. Swanky Leo likes exclusivity but never thinks it is normal, and it certainly doesn't want to be an \"everyone\".

  "<p><strong>THE FINAL COUNTDOWN</strong></p> <p>So here we are at last. The day before England take on Germany in the final match at the twin towers of the home of football of Wembley, the national stadium. But, strangely, the Fiver does not feel too excited this afternoon. Rather there's a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in the air, almost as if we've spent the entire week poring over every last tendon tweak before a game which is likely to be a tedious replay of a fixture we got worked up about only a couple of months ago. Must be something we ate.</p> <p>Anyway, for one last time, here we go. Kelvin Koogan, England coach, is very excited ahead of tomorrow's crucial crunch clash with the Bosch. Even the withdrawal of Liverpool's Steven Gerrard this afternoon with a recurrence of a groin injury hasn't fazed him. \"It's disappointing for him as it's happened before,\" Koog said. \"But it's probably better to happen in training than after five or ten minutes of the match.\" Too right, and Koog's got loads of other players to choice from anyway. \"With the players I have got I think we are covered double and treble in most positions,\" he said. Please God, don't let it be Paul Ince.</p> <p>A practical example of Koogan's first law aside, the England meistermind refrained from naming his team and surprisingly chose instead to concentrate on the historical significance of the match. \"I have told the 11 players who I have picked, they know this is the opportunity to be part of something special,\" he said. \"Until we lay the ghost of 1966 everyone is going to talk about Moore, Hurst, Peters, Bobby Charlton. But they can do something about that.\" But after a whole hour pondering the subject, the Fiver still isn't sure what.</p> <p>England XI (probable): Seaman; G Neville, Adams, Keown, Le Saux; Barmby, Scholes, Ince, Beckham; Owen, Cole.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>AN EXCLUSIVE DAVID BECKHAM INTERVIEW</strong></p> <p>The only international footballer to have appeared on the front page of a national newspaper last weekend looking like a member of Take That circa 1992 is interviewed in this month's Observer Sport Monthly, which comes free with this weekend's Observer.

Sadly, no-one will ever remember them, as the lows - losing his place for the FA Cup final replay, dropping howlers that helped Scotland out of, not one, but two World Cups - are so much more memorable. So things looked to be taking an unexpected turn for the better when the SFA asked Leighton to travel with the Scottish Under-21 squad this week, despite having walked out on the senior squad only two years ago. But as Leighton would no doubt testify himself, appearances can be deceptive. </p> <p>\"I don't see it as a problem that [Leighton] is on this trip,\" Scotland coach Craig Brown said earlier today. \"He always played well for his country and I don't think anyone will be complaining.\" Which makes the fact that Brown was forced to sack Leighton this afternoon all the more unfortunate. Especially since it appears that Leighton was relieved of his duties because of his upcoming autobiography which is said, amongst other things, to have a pop at both Brown and the SFA.</p> <p>So it looks like another humiliation for Leighton who has packed his bags, left the Scottish camp and is off to do some radio commentary on Scotland's World Cup qualifier with San Marino instead. The Fiver wishes Leighton the best of luck, although if he intends to have a refreshing drink while carrying out his duties tomorrow, we'd advise staying as far away as he can from the electrical equipment.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I'll be backing the English and hope that my former Arsenal team-mates and the rest of [Kelvin Koogan's side] are triumphant.

You could get 5/1 on Ron Atkinson, who was called \"a crazy man\", and twos on David \"cretin\" James, the \"moron\". Meanwhile, odds-on favourite was team-mate Nigel Winterburn, who was referred to as \"silly\". With a well-balanced book, the Fiver was confident of making a tidy profit, especially when a Scottish-Canadian bloke wearing a false moustache and glasses stupidly risked \u00a3500 on 10,000/1 outsider Fergus McCann. But sure enough</p> <p>\"I am taking Paolo Di Canio to task over his recent false and damaging remarks,\" the former Celtic chief executive quipped today, after the former Bhoy accused him of breaking his word. \"Legal papers will be served. In a real world we are all accountable for our words and actions, a lesson Mr Di Canio is about to learn. It is important that individuals such as di Canio are not allowed to get away with misleading the public and particularly the Celtic support. I also have a personal obligation to defend my reputation.\" He does sound rather determined, doesn't he?</p> <p>At this stage, exactly what Mr McCann has taken umbrage with is anybody's guess. But the following rant suggests it could be about unreasonable contract negotiations. \"I wish I had taken this action some years ago and exposed Di Canio and Pierre van Hooijdonk for the disreputable way they abused Celtic\", McCann claimed. \"Both individuals signed detailed binding contracts approved by their agents and were delighted to do so, then later - having had their careers greatly enhanced by playing for Celtic - sought to make false claims against myself and the club.\" In fact, so convinced are we that this is the source of McCann's pique, we've placed a hefty bet accordingly.

  "<p>The past is another country, they buy bags differently there. Remember? When you made your handbag choice on the strength of: a) size - could it hold a kitchen sink? b) longevity - would it hold up to the kitchen sink? c) aesthetics - did it go with your clothes, did you actually like it? </p> <p>Over the past 15 years, handbag buyers have swapped personal needs and taste for status. Rather than wear their hearts on their sleeves, women today are choosing a power bag. </p> <p>Italians understand this notion very well. They should - they invented it. At Corso Como 10, Milan's most influential fashion store, handbags are displayed with reverence, like works of art, on low glass tables and the fashion elite quietly coos over supple leathers and hand-stitched finishes. The \"it's-not-what-you-know-it's-who-you-know\" philosophy translates very nicely into Italian bag-buying. Get ahead, get a handbag. The right handbag with the right name on it. You could almost forget about clothes. </p> <p>Reigning supreme over our taste in accessories stands Prada. Stick your hand up right now, Miuccia. You are responsible for turning us all into handbag junkies. As far back as the late 80s, we swooned for gilt-trimmed Chanel lookalikes; then there were the little black nylon backpacks complete with the Prada triangle of authenticity; and when the rest of the world caught on you went the exclusive route with gorgeous limited editions that got us crashing into Prada stores across the globe. </p> <p>The lesser-known face of Prada is Patrizio Bertelli, Miuccia's husband. They first met at a trade fair, at which Miuccia accused him of ripping off her bag designs (which she later admitted were very good), and they have since turned Muiccia's grandfather's musty luggage label into a multi-million-pound super-brand. </p> <p>Following Prada's success, they bought 75% of the Jil Sander label and 51% of Helmut Lang, both of which have produced very elegant handbags this season. At Corso Como 10, an entire table is given over to Lang's petite satin and patent leather envelope bags. Bertelli's influence? Perhaps, because he knows better than anyone how to manipulate us buyers - to give us what we want when we don't even know what it is. This season it was the doctor's bag, which sold almost as quickly as it was copied by the high street. Come spring, a predicted sell-out is the black nappa leather rectangular handbag with an extra wide khaki strap, short enough so the bag can sit elegantly and securely on the wrist. </p> <p>Hot on Prada's stiletto heels comes Gucci. What Prada gains in fashion kudos, Gucci makes up for in sexiness. Since becoming design director in 1994, Tom Ford has driven the company to the fashion front with a strict regime that presses all our lust buttons at once. The shop interiors, the ad campaigns, the catwalk presentations, the models' hair and make-up, the clothes themselves are all designed to scream sex. Once that association was secure, it was only a matter of time before we started buying the bags. </p> <p>This season, the most desirable Gucci bag is a golden envelope with a lion's head clasp. In spring, the overall trend moves towards a military look with elegant silver cases hanging from wide leather straps. Worldwide turnover at Gucci stands at $2.2b and the company is currently being fought over by two big French groups, LVMH and Pinault-Printemps-Redoute. Everybody, it would appear, wants to grab a bit of the Gucci magic. </p> <p>Which leads us neatly to Fendi, another Italian powerhouse, which only a year ago transferred 51% of its capital to a venture equally owned by LVMH and Prada. But to be fair, Fendi were fighting for space in your wardrobe already. </p> <p>Since 1965, Karl Lagerfeld has fused his creative genius with the expert craftsmanship of the family-run company set up in 1925. It enjoyed great success in the 70s with its luxurious ready-to-wear collections and the Fendi handbag took off when Lagerfeld helped to define 80s logo excess with the birth of the Fendi double F logo. </p> <p>But the giant step forward came in the late 90s with the advent of its patisserie-inspired bags (baguette, croissant) which immediately became collectors' items. This season's return to an unabashed flaunting of wealth suits Lagerfeld down to the ground. His most sought-after handbag is an updated version of the baguette in flash gold sequins. It is a Fendi handbag that remains true to its roots, unapologetic in its extravagance. </p> <p>In a much quieter way, luxury leather label Bottega Veneta has slipped into our consciousness with a range of handbags that has a different association - underground cool. How do you get instant street cred? With a collection designed by ex-St Martins student Giles Deacon and UK stylist Katie Grand (formerly with Alexander McQueen at Givenchy). </p> <p>After showing two collections in New York and masterminding a sophisticated ad campaign, Bottega Veneta have become something of a fashion insider's secret. Their definitive woven nappa bags sold out this season before half the fashionistas had a chance to snap them up. Get down there early for next season's sure-fire hit - a white woven envelope sprayed with multicoloured graffiti. </p> <p>Tod's are also relative newcomers to the handbag war. Just three short years ago, Diego Della Valle, son of the founder of the company, introduced a limited range of handbags to his already highly successful Tod's shoe line. The D bag, with instantly identifiable D-shaped straps, found its way on to the shoulders of Hillary Clinton, the late Princess Diana and Cindy Crawford. Since then, Tod's have formed a loyal following among the LA celeb brigade. But with Tod's it's not just about celeb endorsement. Della Valle prides himself on the quality and longevity of his goods. \"Sharon Stone might get the customer to buy initially,\" he has said, \"but unless the handbag lives up to the expectation, unless it is practical and hardwearing, then the customer won't come back. Seventy per cent of our customers are regular clients.\" </p> <p>So if you want what Calista Flockhart has got, check out the next American awards ceremony. You can bet she'll be holding one of Tod's minuscule sequined sacks with silver hoop handles. Make sure you get on the three-month waiting list early.</p>",
  "Israeli troops killed four Palestinians today in renewed clashes with thousands of demonstrators in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in what the Palestinians billed as a \"day of rage\". Israel had attempted to head off new outbursts of fighting by sealing off the Palestinian areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli forces also pulled back from a potentially explosive confrontation near a bitterly contested religious site in Jerusalem's Old City. <p>In a direct challenge to Israel's sovereignty claim, Palestinians raised their flag on the Al Aqsa Mosque in the walled compound revered by Muslims and Jews. </p> <p>As the ceasefire negotiated yesterday collapsed, Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen exchanged fire at several places in the West Bank and Gaza where tens of thousands of protesters marched on Israeli military positions. Two Palestinians were killed in the West Bank town of Nablus, one died nearby in Tulkaram and one was shot dead in Gaza. Dozens were injured. </p> <p>Overall, 71 people have been killed and about 1,900 injured, most of them Palestinians, in nine days of fighting since a controversial visit by the rightwing Israeli politician Ariel Sharon to the compound, revered by Jews as the biblical Temple Mount. Israel says the Palestinians seized on Mr Sharon's visit as a pretext for fighting.</p> <p>Today's clashes eruped after midday prayers at the controversial al Haram al-Sharif mosque in Jerusalem when Israeli police fired tear gas at Palestinian stone throwers.</p> <p>The trouble erupted almost immediately after some 8,000 worshippers came out of the mosque, where last week's Israeli-Palestinian violence started. </p> <p>In an unprecedented act of cooperation, Israeli and Palestinian security forces coordinated security efforts. Plainclothes Palestinian security agents formed a line to block people from throwing stones and leaving the compound in the direction of Israeli forces.</p> <p>However, clashes between Israeli forces and the Palestinians erupted just outside the exits and the Palestinians were driven back by tear gas near an entrance to the Old City. Israeli police eventually withdrew from the area, in an apparent effort to avoid direct confrontation.</p> <p>Israel had succeeded in its aim of keeping down the number of Muslims travelling from the volatile territories to the mosque, and the number of worshippers was well below the usual figure of 10,000 to 15,000. Some were prevented from reaching the mosque by the closure of the Palestinian territories, and others may have stayed away over concern about potential clashes. </p> <p>Tension eased temporarily yesterday after security measures were agreed to in talks in Paris between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak. The Israelis withdrew tanks from several of the most explosive sites, and the Palestinians sought to keep rioters in check.</p> <p>An Israeli army spokeswoman said Israel's border with the West Bank and Gaza Strip had been sealed early this morning, barring Palestinians from entering Israel until Monday night, the end of the day-long Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. </p>",
  "Serbia and neighbours are too often vilified as a nest of vipers, absorbed with ancient and obscure feuds. That analysis is insulting not only to human nature, but to history. To be sure, the Balkan nations are no strangers to bloody conflict, but most of their wars have been forced upon upon them by bigger powers, ever willing to exploit local rivalries to further their own ruthless ambitions. <p>It is not altogether fanciful to trace back such outside interference to the dawn of recorded history, when the Slavic nations first emerged from central Asia to batter at the crumbling doors of Roman power.</p> <p>Certainly, throughout the long decay of the Byzantine empire and the centuries of Turkish expansion, emperors found willing vassals among the warlords and princelings of the Balkans. </p> <p>Nearer our own time, the retreat of the Ottoman empire fired the nationalism of Serbs, Bulgars, Greeks and other nationalities of the region - but it also sparked the ambition of the Habsburg rulers of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and the Romanovs in Moscow. </p> <p>Hungry to become a naval power, the Habsburgs contrived the annexation of Bosnia, a central event in the deadly sequence which led to the first world war.</p> <p>That war was the greatest military disaster which had yet befallen Europe. The Treaty of Versailles, which followed it, was our greatest diplomatic disaster - nowhere more than in the Balkans. </p> <p>The dismemberment of the Habsburg domains allowed the creation - or rather, imposition - of a new kingdom in the region, bringing together the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, plus a large number of ethnic Albanians. The new 'nation' became Yugoslavia, the land of the south Slavs. </p> <p>Centuries of history were repeated in the second world war, when the Balkans again become a cockpit for the battles of the great powers. Yugoslavia was invaded and occupied by the Italians and the Germans. The splintered resistance movements were eagerly supported, first by Britain and then by the USA, as they diverted huge numbers of Axis troops from the main fronts. </p> <p>In the beginning the Allies backed the Chetniks, or royalist army of resistance, but fairly quickly switched their aid to the much more effective communist partisans led by the remarkable Josip Tito. His forces liberated Belgrade in 1944, fighting alongside the Red Army, and swiftly snuffed out the remnants of the old order. </p> <p>By the early 1950s Marshal Tito had broken with Stalin's Soviet Union and established his own form of communist control, dodging nimbly between Moscow, Peking and the West as circumstances dictated. He strove to establish a new sense of common Yugoslav identity among the federation's ethnic groups, with remarkable success. </p> <p>But Yugoslavia's history caught up with it yet again after Tito died and ethnic nationalism revived. Slobodan Milosevic, who grabbed the main throne in Belgrade in the late 1980s, had all Tito's ambition to weld together the south Slavs - but none of his subtlety. </p> <p>As the cement holding together the federation dissolved, the Western European powers also rediscovered their history. Newly reunited Germany, with its revived sense of destiny in Middle Europe, rushed to recognise the breakaway republics of Slovenia and Croatia, with disastrous consequences for the latter. France and Russia, sensing a seismic shift in the region, made knee-jerk gestures of support to Belgrade. And Britain revived the ancient diplomacy of power-balancing by promoting military intervention to keep the warring groups apart. </p> <p>The pattern of events and alliances was uncannily similar to that before the first world war, 70 years earlier. </p> <p>Milosevic, for his part, did what he could to stoke up the fires of Serbian nationalism to their fierce 1914 heat. He cajoled, armed and incited the Serb communities in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, and when he thought the occasion demanded, did not hesitate to deploy the Yugoslav army. </p> <p>Yet again the European powers intervened, with muddled 'peacekeeping' operations, diplomatic threats, sanctions and, ultimately, last year's atrociously ill-judged air strikes against the remnants of the federal republic. That onslaught resulted in the double ethnic cleansing of Kosovo - first the Albanians were herded out and then the Serbs - and has left the province (still ostensibly an integral part of Serbia and of Yugoslavia) a battered ruin. </p> <p>The federation is effectively finished. Kosovo has gone, and Montenegro is set to secede. What Vojislav Kostunica won in last week's vote was the federal presidency. What he has actually got, is the leadership of Serbia. </p> <p>Interestingly, many of the pronouncements being made in the first flush of post-Milosevic exhilaration explicitly recognise this reality. They talk of Serbia rather than Yugoslavia, and portend yet another re-drawing of Balkan boundaries. </p> <p>But before that happens, Kostunica has to consolidate his hold on power, and address the appallingly messy business of reconstructing the country, both physically and politically. Given the history of the region, both ancient and recent, he will not lack advice and help from outside. </p> <p>Already, Moscow is trawling in Belgrade, and the West too is making overtures. The new regime has to decide whether there are doves of peace circling over Belgrade, or vultures gathering for a new feast. </p> <p>Useful links: <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/serbia\">Special report: Serbia</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/yugo/\">Special report: Yugoslav war crimes</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Kosovo/\">Special report: Kosovo </a> <a href=\"http://www.izbori2000.net/index.php?language=english\" target=\"_new\"> Free Serbia</a> <a href=\"http://www.iwpr.net/index.pl5?home_index.html\" target=\"_new\"> Institute for War and Peace Reporting</a> <a href=\"http://www.melty.com/words/writings/yugo.html\" target=\"_new\">A personal history of Yugoslavia</a> <a href=\"http://www.gov.yu/\" target=\"_new\">Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a></p>",

  "The hated symbol of Slobodan Milosevic's propaganda machine was blazing last night after demonstrators stormed the state television building in Belgrade in the face of teargas and bullets. Two hours later, a crowd watched as five fire crews sought to control the fierce blaze. <p>The authorities knew the television station might be invaded, and from early morning several hundred police were in the building and an armed guard was stationed outside. </p> <p>A bar worker in a nearby cafe said that youngsters began a two-prong attack on the headquarters of Radio Television Serbia (RTS), from the park behind and from the road.

I feel he should have asked for his legs to be retouched, though, because he seems to be suffering from the skinny legs/far gut syndrome that comes to all men as they get older. I love Kevin, but he is mad.\" Even one of Kevin's co-founders is advising people to turn a blind eye to the stunt. \"I wouldn't look at it if I were you - you might find it offensive,\" he said. You're not wrong, Duncan.</p> <p><strong>Caught out on a techie point</strong><br> Programmers panning TV shows? Geeks up in arms about TV stars? What the heck is going on? Anyone would think the BBC had made a show about a dot.com start-up. TV audiences may be unimpressed by This Life 2, the one set in a new media start-up and called Attachments, but those whose lives BBC2 is trying to mimic are even more unimpressed. True, World Productions may have done some homework, but those finicky techies are taking umbrage at any slight faux pas - such as transferring files by throwing floppy disks across the office and talking about downloads and demos as a revenue model. Those that haven't vented their spleen already are invited to do so at Everyonehatesattachments.com. But be careful, these hardcore new media types don't take prisoners. </p> <p><strong>Invaluable sentiment</strong><br> Granada Media chairman Charles Allen began his first address to troops of his newly acquired United News &amp; Media by declaring how much his company values programme-makers. Not such a surprising sentiment, you'd imagine, coming from the boss of a company with a significant TV production arm - but the jaws of senior United TV execs hit the floor all the same. Apparently the only word they were used to hearing from former boss Clive Hollick in the same sentence as \"value\" is \"shareholder\".</p> <p><strong>When the caption fits...</strong><br>Sir Christopher Bland got a morning grilling from the delectable Sophie Raworth (isn't Jeremy looking fetching too with his matching purple tie?) on BBC breakfast news today. Pity about the caption though, which read: \"Fiona Mannion: mini owner\".</p> <p><strong>expectingcomplaints.com</strong><br>Monkey apologies for allowing a cad like Danny Kelly to blatantly pull the wool over readers' eyes in Monday's edition of the Media Guardian. Asked about his favourite websites, Kelly named expectingrain.com and woolyrockstars.com. Pernickety readers, i.e. those that go through absolutely everything with a fine-tooth comb, immediately pointed out that the latter website does not in fact exist. More importantly neither the .com or the .co.uk domain names for Woolyrockstars have been registered. Was Kelly making a mockery of us all or was he merely pointing out a new market niche? Kelly says neither: \"I'm very much afraid this thing does exist. The url, however, is woollyrockers.com. Check it out!!\" Duh! Monkey did and fell in love with the Bee Gees doll. Could Kelly have created a monster? </p> <p><strong>Minutes matter</strong><br>What's this? The BBC's famously impartial news reporting standards slipping over its own 10pm news bulletin announcement? The Monkey has got its paws on an internal email from BBC Online producer James Thornet that was sent round after the news broke to BBC online hacks out in the sticks. He draws his colleagues' attention to the fact that the switch to 10pm means the regional bulletin tacked on at the end of the proper, grown-up news will be extended to a massive six-and-a-half minutes. \"We must put this story at the top of online news stories asap,\" says the excitable Thornett. Is he worried viewers in the regions wouldn't notice the difference otherwise? </p> <p><strong>Only slimline warriors need apply</strong><br> Monkey has received an email from Rainbow network, home of Xena fans (see proud to portly, below), anxious to set the record straight. \"Firstly, the generosity of Channel 5 in offering Rainbow a box of T-shirts goes without saying - we were delighted to receive them, and we had loads of entrants to the competition in which they were the prize. On opening the eagerly awaited box of goodies, however, we could tell straight away that there was no way, with the best will in the world, anyone other than a small teenager or large Teddy bear was going to be able to get into them.<br> We closed the competition as images of irate readers struggling to get an arm in a size 6 garment sprang to mind. As Tamara, the Xena co-ordinator at Channel 5, said: 'Annoyingly our merchandise person fits these and didn't consider the more womanly figure, ie me.' We're with you, Tamara! <br>Some lucky winners did decide to hang on to their prizes, although we still have 35 or so here in the Rainbow office. Send us your address and we'll happily send you one.\" Monkey is unsure about being compared to a large teddy bear, but may well have to take up Rainbow's kind offer in the spirit of investigation. </p> <p><br> <br> <strong>Sticky gimmicks</strong><br> Monkey was amused to discover an overflowing pot of honey in the post today. The honey pot subsequently attacked all surrounding computers and made everything in the office sticky. Eugh. The penny finally dropped when Monkey found the attached (and at this point very sticky) note, saying that eBay was stickier than QXL. Point taken. But did it really have to destroy my workspace to tell me that? <br> <br> <strong>Clash of the dot.com giants</strong><br> Plunging dot.com stock prices are nothing new, but the long-term ramifications are starting to impact heavily on those big boys we call Amazon and eBay. Rumours have started to surface about a mooted merger between the two e-commerce giants, which have both been rocked by the recent downturn in dot.com fortunes. A tie-up would make sense, particularly for Amazon, which is struggling to convince investors of its long-term earnings. Perhaps it should take a leaf from eBay's gimmick book and start sending out plants and pots of bottled Amazon river water to prove to investors that Amazon can make things grow. Just a (naff) suggestion. <br> <br> <strong>Proud to portly</strong><br> Channel 5 kindly sent 50 of its finest Xena, Warrior Princess T-shirts to the gay and lesbian website Rainbownetwork.com for a competition giveaway, on account of the pigtailed one being terribly popular with the target audience. Channel 5 was staggered, then, when Rainbow very apologetically sent them all back. It seems the T-shirts are of the cropped belly button-baring variety and, after a bit of market research in the office, Rainbow discovered they were too petite for its users. Seems a shame to let them go to waste, so Monkey is happy to try to squeeze into one to show support. <br> <br> <strong>Bad taste sensation</strong><br> GMTV managing director Christopher Stoddart is so concerned about reports of tasteless office banter that he has issued an email to all staff reminding them of the company's equal opportunities policy. In a carefully worded memo, he also reminded staff of the company's grievance procedure and told them that they mustn't feel frightened of whistle-blowing on their bosses. \"From time to time we will be drawing your attention to important company policies which we all need to follow. Our equal opportunities policy is particularly important because its scope is both on-screen and off-screen,\" he wrote. \"Should any employee have a complaint under this policy [or for any other reason] he should feel free to raise the matter.\" He continued: \"If it concerns their line manager, then they may wish to consult personnel.\" Who on earth has prompted this and what on earth did he or she say? Answers on the back of a cornflakes box, please.<br> <br> <strong> Rings a bell</strong><br> Readers of the Scotsman who also take Sunday Business may be suffering from a sense of d\u00e9ja vu. A few weeks ago top Sunday Biz hack Richard Northedge wrote a coruscating profile of some suit or other doing something fantastically important in the City. Two weeks later a frighteningly similar article (exactly the same except for two small amendments) appeared in the Scotsman's revamped business section, albeit under a different byline. Perhaps Northedge should sue for plagiarism. But then the ed-in-chief of the pink Sunday is one Andrew Neil, who is also in charge of the Scotsman. Other Sunday Business hacks should expect further doppelganger copy to start appearing north of the border under increasingly ludicrous invented bylines. </p> <p> <strong>Not quite all over for Wembley commentator</strong> <br> The man who coined the immortal phrase \"They think it1s all over...\" really did think Wembley was going to be all over without him.

  "A very strong earthquake struck south western Japan, destroying at least six homes, burying three people in landslides, and cutting off power supplies to thousands of houses and businesses, police said. <p>The quake was even stronger than the 7.2 magnitude one that struck Kobe, Japan, in January 17, 1995, killing 6,425 people and destroying 250,000 homes. </p> <p>National television showed live footage of workers at an NHK broadcasting newsroom in Matsue city clutching desks as notebooks fell to the floor. One hanging lamp was shown swinging wildly back and forth. </p> <p>In other buildings in the city, the white foam of ceiling fire extinguishers set off by the quake could be seen raining down from balconies onto the streets. </p> <p>In Hinocho town, a small hospital shook so violently that the staff evacuated all 80 patients from the building to check it for damage. </p> <p>\"It was so strong that I couldn't stand up,\" Shinichi Nagami, a government spokesman in the large city of Sakaiminato, said on national television. Cracks appeared in the walls of some of the buildings there, NHK reported. </p> <p>The quake also knocked over display cases at stores and supermarkets in Yonago city, and television showed shattered glass and products strewn across the floors of several shops. </p> <p>At least 10 landslides were caused by the earthquake across the large, hilly region, including one that blocked a railroad line and one that closed part of a two-lane highway. </p> <p>Six homes in Tottori prefecture, or state, collapsed, and one man was injured when the roof of his home fell on him, said Toshikatsu Naoi, a National Police Agency spokesman. </p> <p>Three other people were hurt when they were buried in landslides and rescued by civilians and local officials. Two of the victims were trapped inside their car. The third man suddenly disappeared while working at a roadside construction site. </p> <p>The tremor was so strong it was felt 155 miles away in Suzuka city, where drivers from around the world were practicing for the F-1 Grand Prix auto race on Sunday. </p> <p>Shortly after the earthquake struck at 1:30pm (04:30 GMT), officials closed several railway lines and highways to check for damage, NHK reported. Two nuclear reactors had recently been shut down in Tottori prefecture for repairs before the quake struck. </p> <p>The tremor cut electricity supplies to nearly 9,300 homes and businesses, and many traffic lights at intersections, but power was restored to most of them soon afterward, Kyodo News agency said. At least one water pipe ruptured. The magnitude 7.3 earthquake was centred six miles beneath Tottori prefecture, 315 miles southwest of Tokyo, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. A 7.0-magnitude quake is capable of causing heavy, widespread damage. </p> <p>Despite the strength of the quake, and many powerful aftershocks, the agency said no tsunami was expected in the Japan Sea along the coast of the <a name=\"A\">prefecture</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Food tastes different at 30,000ft. And that's nothing to do with the \"Ooh, I'm in an aeroplane off on my holidays,\" effect. It actually does taste different. No one knows why this should be, nor even whether it is the food itself that is materially altered at altitude, or the palate's ability to interpret flavours or, indeed, whether everything just tastes odd when you eat it from a plastic tray, legs scrunched up half to your chest, chin butting against the seat in front, surrounded by screaming children. </p> <p>Soon, though, we should find out, because this is just one point on a long list of tasks that will be assigned to the new professor of airline food at the University of Surrey whose imminent appointment was announced this week. \"So much fun has been made of airline food but it's a big industry,\" says Willie Seeman, founder-president of the International Flight Catering Association (IFCA) which represents all major airline food producers and is funding the appointment. The professor will have a three-pronged brief: to do research into the industry, to teach, and to cooperate closely with the IFCA committees that work on food safety, education and care for the environment. </p> <p>We have come a long way since Charles Lindbergh made his 34-hour solo flight across the Atlantic with just five sandwiches in his travelling bag. In-flight catering is now a \u00a310bn-a-year global industry employing more than 100,000 people. Virgin Atlantic says catering is its third biggest cost, behind fuel and engineering and maintenance. A jumbo jet preparing to set out on a long-haul flight may be loaded with up to 42,000 separate catering items. British Airways passengers flying out of London Heathrow chew their way through 70,000 meals each day and consume 41 tonnes of chicken breasts, 45 tonnes of strawberries, 127 tonnes of tomatoes and 600,000 pints of milk every year. All BA meals are cooked two to eight hours before they are needed and are kept chilled before being loaded onto the plane where they are reheated in ovens that have the capacity to steam and bake. First class and business class meals are at least partially fresh - you can boil an egg and cook pasta on a plane. </p> <p>\"Psychologically we attach great importance to the food we're given in the air,\" says David Airey, head of the school of management studies at the University of Surrey. \"I get very agitated if I'm not served quickly, or if my wine doesn't come straight away with my food, in a way that I just don't in restaurants on the ground. And if I think I'm going to miss my turn I get very upset too.\" </p> <p>For airline passengers may be a captive audience but they are also highly critical. Now that air travel is as routine as boarding the 8.43am to Waterloo we're not willing to forgive those who fail to meet the exacting standards demanded by our newly educated palates. Though this doesn't explain why we get so ridiculously worked up about it. </p> <p>\"The actual purpose of the carrier is to get people from A to B without killing them and if everything goes all right they forget this,\" points out Michael Kipps, co-author of a book on flight catering and professor of food management at Surrey. \"The only variable part of the service is the food and that's why we talk about it so much.\" </p> <p>So will the appointment of a professor make airline food more tasty, and bring more sophisticated meals to our laps? </p> <p>\"We're trying to bring restaurants into the skies,\" says British Airways which, like the other major airlines, commission extensive research into passenger appetites. According to both BA and Virgin, we want three things: nutritious and healthy food; the ability to control both what and when we eat; and menus to reflect the sort of food we eat on the ground. </p> <p>The core menu choices in Virgin's economy class are roast beef with Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes, broccoli and gravy; chicken korma with coriander rice; and pasta with roast vegetables and goat's cheese. On a typical flight, 40% of passengers will go for the roast, 40% for the korma and the remaining 20% for the vegetarian pasta. </p> <p>But travellers are a tricky lot to please. BA was surprised when no one wanted to eat beef rangdang, a dish they put on their world traveller menu. It turned out that no one knew quite what it was. So the airline changed its name to Malaysian-style beef curry and its popularity soared. </p> <p>Some airlines have developed a system that allows people to order food whenever their body-clock demands it. Virgin calls it the freedom menu and says that, while it offers a range of sophisticated dishes from aromatic Thai prawns to beef medallions, the favourite for businessmen returning from meetings in the Far East or America is that old comfort food, the bacon sarnie. </p> <p>What you eat out of is also critical. In economy class foil containers have in many cases been replaced by a more pleasing plastic version. Passengers who upgrade get proper cups and plates. BA has just signed a contract with Wedgwood while Virgin has found that what their customers like to drink with their bacon butties is tea - in a mug rather than a cup. </p> <p>In a few years time we might reach the stage where, on short-haul flights at least, the airline doesn't serve us food on the plane but allows us to buy it from the departure lounge. There would be scope for much more choice but Michael Kipps doesn't think airlines will ever let it happen. \"The debris on the aircraft afterwards would be dreadful.\" </p> <p>So, for now, that idea remains nothing more than pie in the sky.</p>",
  "<p>Harrison Ford is to star as the captain of a doomed Russian nuclear submarine in a storyline that's causing controversy even before shooting begins. </p> <p>According to a report in today's Daily Express, the 58-year-old actor will be paid \u00a314m for the role of the quick-witted captain in the film K-19.

  "The Yugoslav army today indicated its acceptance of the uprising that overthrew Slobodan Milosevic by saying it will act only if its military facilities, personnel and material goods come under direct threat. <p>The Tanjug news agency, which yesterday abandoned its support for the Milosevic regime, said the top army leadership had met early this morning. Citing sources close to the army leadership, it said: \"The Yugoslav army remains consistent to the stands publicly announced several times that it will act within its constitutional powers.\"</p> <p>Today's meeting, a day after opposition supporters took control of the Yugoslav parliament building and state media, is seen as crucial to the outcome of the popular revolt as it appears that the army and security forces have accepted as a fait accompli the end of Mr Milosevic's reign. </p> <p>The army will take comfort from the fact that Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition leader who has been declared president after last month's presidential election, does not accept the jurisdiction of the Hague tribunal on war crimes and is a fervent Serb nationalist.</p> <p>No movements by military units were reported anywhere in the country today. Momcilo Perisic, a former army chief of staff and now an opposition figure, said he had contacted Yugoslavia's military leaders and that they had promised not to intervene. </p> <p>The whereabouts of Mr Milosevic are unclear, but there are reports that he is in a bunker in Beljanica, some 25 miles west of the town of Bor, which is close to the Romanian and Bulgarian borders. </p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, arrived in Belgrade today, the first foreign official to arrive in Serbia since yesterday's tumultuous events. He is to meet Mr Kostunica and there were suggestions that he would also meet Mr Milosevic. But Russia, one of Yugoslavia's traditional allies, says the question of asylum for the fallen tyrant is not under consideration.</p> <p>Russia's Interfax news agency quoted the Russian prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, as saying that the question of asylum \"has not been raised and is not being discussed. We are a long way from looking at the question in that way.\"</p> <p>In Belgrade, jubilant crowds roamed the streets early this morning, celebrating the end of 13 years of Mr Milosevic's rule. Fears persist that there could be counterattacks by remnants of the discredited regime. Through the night, tens of thousands danced and sang in celebration of the seizure of Yugoslavia's parliament and other key symbols of the Milosevic regime.</p> <p>All state-owned media were working normally, broadcasting or publishing apologies for their past support for Mr Milosevic. Serb television occasionally flashed its logo during broadcasts, with the slogan: \"This is the new free Serbian television.\" </p> <p>State-owned or formerly pro-Milosevic dailies issued special editions reflecting the change in their editorial policies. Politika featured a front-page photograph of Mr Kostunica, his arm raised triumphantly in the air over a headline: \"Serbia on the road to democracy\" with a subtitle describing him as president. </p> <p>The only voices of dissent in the overwhelmingly positive international reaction to the popular revolt came from Russian officials. The Interfax news agency quoted the head of Russia's communist party, Gennady Zyuganov, as saying he did not approve of events. \"This is not democracy, it smells of marijuana, vodka and dollars,\" he said. </p> <p>Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, welcomed the overthrow of Mr Milosevic, saying that sanctions against Yugoslavia could be lifted on Monday when the European parliament next meets. He added: \"We can then get down to the task of rebuilding.\"</p>",
  "<p>Space shuttle Discovery's flight to the international space station has been postponed until next week because of a sluggish valve and suspect bolts. </p> <p>Nasa called off last night's launch because of last-minute concerns over bolts on the external fuel tank. A valve problem found later in the shuttle's main propulsion system delayed liftoff until at least Monday. </p> <p>The valve, which controls the flow of fuel, appeared to be sluggish during routine operations. Workers will have to enter Discovery's engine compartment to check the valve; to replace it, if necessary, will take three days. </p> <p>This 100th space shuttle flight is a crucial space station construction mission. Nasa, however, is in no rush. </p> <p>\"We think it's prudent to stand down,\" shuttle manager James Halsell said. \"In other words, we do not want to get 'go fever.\"' </p> <p>Before launching Discovery, Nasa also wants to understand what caused a bolt malfunction on the last space shuttle flight. The problem occurred during Atlantis' liftoff on September 8, but was discovered only Wednesday. </p> <p>While analysing film returned to Earth aboard Atlantis two weeks ago, engineers noticed that one of the three bolts between Atlantis and the external fuel tank did not retract properly eight minutes into the flight. Photographs showed some of the bolt sticking out on the tank. </p> <p>Nasa wants to determine, among other things, whether the bolt malfunction poses a danger. At worst, a protruding bolt could cause the separated tank to tumble and slam into the shuttle. </p> <p>\"I think the word you use would be 'catastrophic,\"' said Halsell, himself a shuttle pilot. \"I would not want to expose astronauts to that risk.\" </p> <p>Halsell said Nasa remains committed to launching space shuttles seven or eight times a year. Next time, though, the space agency may try to analyse the film more quickly, he noted. </p> <p>The troublesome bolt from Atlantis is at the bottom of the Atlantic, along with what is left of the rest of the external fuel tank. The 153-foot, rust-coloured tank is jettisoned once the shuttle reaches orbit. </p> <p>There is evidence of bolt problems on previous flights, including Endeavour's launch in February, said launch manager Bill Gerstenmaier. But the bolts have never protruded like this, he said. </p> <p>Nasa would not speculate on how long it would take to replace or fix the bolts on Discovery's fuel tank, if that became necessary. </p> <p>\"We hold out all hope that through analysis... we can make ourselves feel comfortable that we're safe to go fly,\" Halsell said. \"I also want to say our minds are wide open; to the possibility of a lengthy delay, he added. </p> <p>Discovery holds two new segments for the international space station, a girderlike truss and a docking port for future shuttle visits.</p> <p>Nasa wants these parts installed before the first permanent crew lifts off at the end of the month. </p> <p>Nasa usually has more time between flights to review all the data from the previous mission, but has quickened its launch pace to build the international space station. </p> <p>The minimum number of days allowed between shuttle launches is 21. This gap would have been 27 days if Discovery had soared Thursday.</p>",

A fridge, I tell the viewer, is the very best place you can think of to perform those vital body-toning exercises that are so necessary for a shapely \"tum\". I then lean against the fridge with my right arm outstretched, slowly moving my left foot through an arc of 180 degrees, then I turn around and do the same thing with the other arm and foot. After a couple of minutes of this exercise, I take a well-earned breather and open the fridge to fetch out all the ingredients for one of my all-time favourite starters: Timbale of Smoked Salmon with a Low Fat Cottage Cheese on a Bed of Lean Bacon Potato Cake with Extra Thick Chocolate-and-Peanut Custard. </p> <p>With all the ingredients laid out before me on my stainless steel work-surface, I tell viewers that this is a brilliant \"bluffer's\" dish that takes only a matter of minutes to prepare - yet is guaranteed to impress even your most standoffish guests! Then, before embarking on the preparation, I remind everyone that the absolute best way to lose weight in the kitchen is to engage in a tightly controlled regime of aerobics while doing all the cooking. For instance, it's easy as pie to perform my stretch-and-stretch/stretch-and-stretch exercises with your knees and lower thighs while preparing the Extra Thick Chocolate-and-Peanut-Custard with your upper body. </p> <p>With the starter all ready and looking simply out-of-this-world, I jog backwards (excellent for slicing pounds off the buttock area, would you believe!) to the fridge and move straight on to the main course - Boudin of Guinea Fowl Stuffed with Veal Sweetbreads with Mussel and Saffron Sauce on a Coulis of Low Fat Blackcurrant Yoghurt. But before I embark on the preparation, I am filmed strapping on my rollerblades, switching my CD to full-blast and then -between the stirring and the pummelling, the slicing and the frying - letting it all hang out and shedding inches off the old waistline by boogying on down to the all-time greatest hits of Macy Gray. </p> <p>To complete the meal, I prepare a simple Butterscotch Mousse with Vanilla Ice-Cream and Low-Fat Cr\u00e8me Fraiche on a tray on the floor while performing 10 old fashioned press-ups. Smashing! And so - with all the hard work completed - I get myself in the mood for my dinner party by slipping into a favourite frock and pouring myself a rewarding glass of champagne, accompanied by some wholemeal taco chips and an amazing marzipan and cream-cheese dip. </p> <p> The lovely thing about the TV programme is that it doesn't just show the food preparation \u00e0 la Delia - it also lets the viewers participate in the dinner party itself (though not literally, obviously: I haven't got a clue who half of them are!). In that first programme, my guests include arts supremo Chris Smith, the inspirational Anita Roddick, the ever vivacious Eve Pollard and top lyricist Tim Rice (who, he tells me, is fighting a losing battle with his waistline!). </p> <p>Talk flowed. As usual, it began with cooking (\"Don't tell anybody - promise!\" said Eve as we dug into our Smoked Salmon Timbales, \"but I've just picked up the most brilliant way of stuffing an artichoke with that marvellous new Tesco's wholemeal blancmange\"), before moving on to dieting (\"I've lost just over three pounds in six weeks on my splendid new break-dancing machine,\" revealed Chris. But I mustn't give too much away. You'll have to watch it for yourselves - and do please mark spring 2002 in your diaries for my follow-up series, Cook that Flab. Enjoy!</p>",
  "Israeli riot police fanned out around the holiest Muslim site in Jerusalem last night in preparation for today's afternoon prayers, which will provide the definitive test of the latest tentative truce. <p> After the eight-day spasm of violence which reduced parts of Gaza and the West Bank to a state of near war, diplomatic efforts produced a relative reprieve. But reports of casualties still trickled in. A Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli snipers outside a flashpoint in the Gaza Strip, and on the West Bank a 20-year-old Palestinian man was shot dead in Beit Jala, near Bethlehem.</p> <p> Their death underlined the tenuous grip of the ceasefire agreement extracted from the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, during a six-hour session in Paris with the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright.</p> <p> Mr Barak instructed his army to withdraw the tanks which have been staging a showof force from the entrances to Palestinian cities and return its soldiers to the posts they occupied before the clashes. A parallel order was issued to the Palestinian security forces and the activists who have steered the protests.</p> <p> But within minutes the two were exchanging angry accusations after Mr Arafat demanded an international investigation into the week of bloodshed, in which 69 people, mostly Palestinian, have died. Mr Barak refused, and boycotted yesterday's follow-up summit, hosted by the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, at a resort on the Sinai peninsula.</p> <p> Their failure to agree written ceasefire guarantees underlined the precarious situation on the ground. With tempers still running high, the call to Friday afternoon prayers at Haram al-Sharif mosque could provoke a conflagration. There was an increase in tension with the Palestinian release of Hamas prisoners in Gaza, and a call by Hamas for a day of protest today.</p> <p> The Haram al-Sharif, which houses the golden Dome of the Rock, has been the centre of the protests, which were triggered by the visit there last Thursday by the hardline leader of the Likud opposition party, Ariel Sharon.</p> <p> Mr Arafat returned to Gaza from his meetings with Mrs Albright and Mr Mubarak accusing Israel of using excessive force and renewing his demand for an inquiry. </p> <p> \"We will insist . . . on the necessity and the importance of convening an international fact-finding panel on what our people have suffered from massacres and severe aggression that violate international law,\" he said.</p> <p> After flying home from Paris, Mr Barak met military chiefs, and cabinet ministers to try to plot a way out of the disaster. </p> <p> He reaffirmed his pledge to the peace process, jeopardised by the week of violence. Mrs Albright has invited both negotiating teams to Washington next week to try to restart the talks. Israel has yet to accept, but Mr Barak told a press conference: \"I will leave no stone unturned in the path for peace.\"</p> <p> Yesterday began with encouraging signs. Two dozen Israeli tanks trundled back to their base from the West Bank city of Nablusand the outskirts of Ramallah and Jerusalem. But as the afternoon brought more of the funerals which have driven the recent events, violence erupted anew. </p> <p> At Netzarim junction, where an army bunker guards a Jewish settlement loathed by Palestinians as a symbol of occupation, Israeli snipers fired lat Palestinians, killing at least one man, and injuring 10 more. Protesters armed with petrol bombs had gathered at the post after the funeral of a 13-year-old boy. On the West Bank, soldiers fired rubber-coated bullets in Hebron, wounding three people.</p> <p> But while a tense calm fell on other deserted flashpoints, the failure of the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to endorse a truce kept the atmosphere tense.</p> <p> In Tel Aviv and Jerusalem the US were operating their missions with a skeleton staff, in response to the stoning of their embassy in Damascus. Missions have been closed in the Arab world until next week.</p>",
  "The European Union will never be the same again and Tony Blair knows it. <p>Exactly what the 15-nation club will look like five years from now is, however, less certain - and different countries have different ideas about how it should evolve.</p> <p>Today in Warsaw, in front of an audience of Polish politicians and business leaders, the prime minister staked out his vision for a 21st century European Union. It is a vision which he hopes will resurrect the bloc's dismal popularity back home and ensure that Britain is not sidelined by the likes of France and Germany. </p> <p>The stakes are high and time is running out.</p> <p>A wave of crucial reforms that will alter the balance of power in Brussels are just months away, and 12 mostly eastern European countries including Poland are knocking at the EU's door and will not take no for an answer.</p> <p>The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and the French president, Jacques Chirac, have had their turn at doing the vision thing and now it's Blair's chance.</p> <p>But his words are likely to rattle the European Commission's faltering president, Romano Prodi, who wants to extend the powers of his own unelected institution. And they will irk Chirac, who effectively advocates a Europe led by Paris and Berlin.</p> <p>For Blair is effectively signalling that the rules of the EU game - for so long set in stone and unchallenged - are about to change, and that Britain will struggle to ensure that the new rules are to its liking.</p> <p>The European commission's days as a motor of integration, guiding nation states closer and closer to the holy grail of a United States of Europe with power concentrated in Brussels are numbered, Blair said today.</p> <p>The prime minister believes it is democratic and elected governments who should be in control, and there should be checks and balances to ensure that institutions in Brussels do not exceed their authority. </p> <p>As such, he is proposing a second chamber for the European Union made up of prominent MPs from national parliaments to keep an eye on the EC and the sometimes erratic European parliament.</p> <p>French ambitions of a \"pioneer group\" of more federalist-minded countries - streaking ahead of the rest and wielding far more power as a result - are also kicked into touch. </p> <p>Blair has no problem with countries stepping up EU cooperation in areas such as defence, justice and home affairs. But that must not, he insists, be at the expense of others.</p> <p>\"Deepening can include enhanced cooperation, but that does not mean exclusive bodies. We must preserve equality in the EU, including for the new arrivals,\" says one government official. </p> <p>The subtext is clear - no to a two-speed Europe; but a grudging yes to a multi-layered or multi-tiered Europe, as some officials like to call it.</p> <p>Blair is also showing that Britain may be out of the euro but that does not mean it is out of the game. He is, as he puts it, making Britain \"a champion of enlargement\". And he is the first European leader to come out and say he wants the first new EU members to be signed up by a certain date - in this case 2004. </p> <p>This is astute. For it comes at a time when the timetable for enlargement seems to be slipping and aspirant countries are growing increasingly frustrated at the slow pace of negotiations. </p> <p>Blair is therefore making friends in eastern Europe and ensuring that the project - which is seen as vital to Britain's own interests - remains on track. </p> <p>For a bigger club is likely to be a far more democratic club and that will make profound reform of the EU a crushing inevitability. </p> <p>That should ensure that the growing gap between Europe's ruled and its rulers closes and should make the European project far easier to sell back at home. </p> <p>Blair said today in Warsaw: \"The problems Europe's citizens have with Europe arise when Europe's priorities are not theirs.\" </p> <p>Romano Prodi must be livid: a more democratic Europe will see his own powers diminished. </p> <p>But change is coming. And whatever the outcome of the debate which is about to erupt, Europe will never be the same again.</p>",
  "A witness who gave crucial evidence to convict underworld boss Kenneth Noye of murder was yesterday killed in a gangland-style shooting. <p> Alan Decabral, who described in court how he saw the sun glinting off the blade of Noye's knife before he stabbed 21-year-old electrician Stephen Cameron, was shot twice in the head at close range as he sat in his car.</p> <p> Since Noye was jailed for life in April for the M25 road rage killing, Mr Decabral has lived at a secret address fearing for his life. </p> <p> Such is the fear of Noye's power though he is behind bars that Mr Cameron's fiancee Danielle Cable has been given a new identity and 24-hour police protection. During the trial the jurors were guarded round the clock and their names kept secret.</p> <p> Mr Decabral was in his car waiting to leave the Warren retail park, in Ashford, Kent, at about 1.30pm when he was shot. Witnesses told police they heard the victim scream: \"Please don't kill me. Don't shoot.\"</p> <p> Paul Winters, 41, said: \"I didn't even really hear the sound of any shots, so the killer might have used a silencer.\" </p> <p> Anton Kaye, 26, a deputy shop manager at the park, said: \"There were no doors open and no signs of broken glass, so the killer obviously got up pretty close to him and was possibly in the car.\"</p> <p> Though officers were not officially naming the victim, a police source confirmed that it was Mr Decabral and said: \"He was the victim of a cold-blooded execution. It is too early to say whether there is any link to Noye but Detective Chief Superintendent Dennis McGookin, who investigated Noye for the Cameron murder, was called in once the police had established the victim was Decabral.\" </p> <p> In July Mr Decabral, a father of three who is separated from his wife, gave an interview to the Sunday Mirror in which he admitted he lived in constant fear but said he was glad he had helped put Noye behind bars. </p> <p> He said before the trial he had been ordered by \"gangsters\" to \"shut up or we will shut you up\" and became terrified after three bullets were pushed through his letter box. He said: \"I look over my shoulder every time I go to Sainsbury's.\"</p> <p> Noye is considered one of the most clever and dangerous criminals of his generation. He was cleared of murdering an undercover detective in the grounds of his Kent home in 1985 but was jailed for 14 years for laundering the proceeds of the \u00a326m Brinks Mat gold bullion raid of 1983.</p> <p> After murdering Mr Cameron at the M25's Swanley interchange, in Kent, in May 1996 Noye, 52, fled Britain but after one of the largest manhunts ever was found in Spain and brought back for trial.</p> <p> Police believe Noye pulled his knife because he was losing the fight and could not bear to think a younger man was standing up to him and beating him.</p> <p> Mr Decabral's wife said last night: \"I have just woken up my children to tell them what has happened. I am devastated.\"</p>",
  "Tony Blair today laid out his vision of the European Union's future. The EU, he said, must become a \"superpower but not a superstate\". <p>Speaking in Warsaw to members of the Polish stock exchange, the prime minister called for rapid progress towards enlarging the EU to include eastern European states. And he said there must be major structural reforms to the way the EU operates.</p> <p>His speech follows Denmark's decision not to join the euro zone and signifies an attempt to map out a European policy for Britain which is more engaged than that of the Conservative party and also acceptable to an increasingly sceptical British electorate.</p> <p>He linked an overt commitment to national sovereignty with an implicit acceptance that a wider Europe may also become a \"deeper\" one. That is Euro-speak for a more powerful political centre in Brussels.</p> <p>The prime minister spoke against the background of political turmoil in Yugoslavia. He said that what Poland had begun in the 1980s - the collapse of communism - the Serbian people would finish. </p> <p>\"Milosevic has done enough damage, for one man, in one country,\" he said. \"Three wars. Tens of thousands dead. Millions displaced. Acts of barbarism not seen in Europe since the second world war. Their effect felt throughout Europe. The sooner he is gone, the better for Serbia, the better for the whole of Europe.\"</p> <p>Addressing the future of the EU, Mr Blair said: \"We need to get the political foundations of the European Union right. These foundations are rooted in the democratic nation state.\"</p> <p>He did not favour the development of a multi-speed Europe, with some states, such as Germany and France, integrating ahead of others, particularly in the east. \"Without enlargement, western Europe will always be faced with the threat of instability, conflict and mass migration on its borders. Without enlargement, the political consensus behind economic and political reform in the weaker transition countries may splinter. </p> <p>\"Should that happen, we would all lose. That is why supporting enlargement in principle but delaying in practice is no longer good enough,\" he continued. \"I want to see new member states participating in the European parliamentary elections in 2004 and having a seat at the table at the next IGC [inter-governmental convention].\"</p> <p>He also repeated the view of successive Conservative prime ministers that Britain formed a key \"bridge\" between Europe and the United States. </p> <p>He repeated the government's wait-and-see policy on the euro, cautioning those who saw the Danish referendum as ruling out British membership for the forseeable future.</p> <p>The prime minister attacked the increasingly sceptical stance of the Conservative party. \"We can choose not to be there. But no one should doubt the consequences of that choice and it is wildly unrealistic to pretend those consequences are not serious,\" Mr Blair said.</p> <p>The speech also suggested a range of ideas for structural reform of Europe's core institutions. The prime minister called for a second chamber of the European parliament, to contain members of national parliaments, and for changes to the existing system of individual countries holding the EU presidency.</p> <p>He argued that \"the primary sources of democratic accountability in Europe are the directly elected and representative institutions of the nations of Europe national parliaments and governments.\"</p> <p><b>Useful link</b> <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news.asp?NewsId=1341&amp;SectionId=32\" target=\"_new\">Full text of the prime minister's speech</a></p>",
  "The triumphant leader of the opposition, Vojislav Kostunica, last night addressed jubilant crowds outside the looted parliament building in the centre of Belgrade. He appealed to the army not to intervene and asked supporters to stay on the streets until dawn in case of counter-attacks. <p> \"Good evening, liberated Serbia,\" the 56-year-old former law professor told the cheering crowd. \"We call on the military and police to do everything to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Serbia hit the road of democracy and where there is democracy there is no place for Milosevic.\"</p> <p> Later in the evening Mr Kostunica appeared on the main state television service where he was described as the new president. His message again was a plea for an orderly hand-over of authority. He said he looked forward to a democratic Serbia that had normal relations with other countries and did not suffer sanctions imposed by the US and the EU.</p> <p> Mr Kostunica said from now on state television would be open to a variety of different viewpoints. \"It must be a mirror of all the people's sensibilities,\" he said. \"It's a right of the citizens to be well informed.\" He added: \"We can't forget what some countries did to us last year during the Nato aggression.\"</p> <p> Earlier in the day the television station, a hated symbol of Mr Milosevic's propaganda machine, had been set alight after demonstrators stormed its headquarters in Belgrade in the face of teargas and bullets. </p> <p> Mr Kostunica may not be renowned for his charisma, but the diligent academic has succeeded, unlike any other challenger in the past decade, in inspiring hope among the country's people that a future is possible without Mr Milosevic. </p> <p> He enjoys a reputation for honesty. He is known to drive around in a small car in contrast to the government officials who used Mercedes-Benzes. During the election he campaigned door-to-door and listened to people's views - a concept unheard of in a country where Mr Milosevic was usually seen only on television. </p> <p> During the election, he covered more than more than 3,000 miles, addressing rallies at every stop. Long a staunch anti-communist, Mr Kostunica pursued an academic career until he was kicked out of Belgrade Law School in 1974 for his views. While other opposition leaders cut deals to stay in power, he founded his own party in 1992 and has led it ever since. </p> <p> Even in his moment of triumph last night he expressed humility. \"Serbia, thank you for your trust,\" he told the crowd. \"Thank you for being with us. You are staying here with me. I'm staying here with you.\"</p>",
  "<p>Prague saw a dawning realisation by those responsible for international finance as much as by those on the streets that globalisation has perverse consequences. Free market theory has been put into practice but the result has been the opposite of what was promised. </p> <p>The moves, not least under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, towards the liberalisation of commerce is built on the theory of comparative advantage. Everyone is supposed to benefit. The international institutions on parade in Prague and Seattle promulgated an edict of international competitiveness. It promised growth would ensure wealth for all. Yet comparative advantage - \"do what you do best, and trade for the rest\" - ignores differences in power between traders and producers. The result has been a rise in the gap between rich and poor. The latest World Bank development report, source of the chart, shows average income in the richest 20 countries is 37 times the average in the poorest 20 - a gap that has doubled in the past 40 years. </p> <p>Comparative advantage assumed money would remain local. Since the 70s there has been an acceleration in the opposite direction, in pursuit of \"capital advantage\". This free flow of money internationally is supposed to ensure its efficient and rational use. Again the majority are supposed to be the winners. </p> <p>The 1997 Asian crisis made clear such global flows could have adverse effects. The \"tigers\" had used an astute mixture of domestic protectionism and export-led growth to become the only area in the south where widespread poverty reduction has been achieved. In east Asia, the number of people living on less than $1 a day fell from around 420m in 1987 to around 280m in 1998. </p> <p>After Seattle and Prague we need to think again. Globalisation needs to be replaced by \"localisation\", protecting and rebuilding local economies. Long-distance trade would be gradually reduced to supplying what could not come from within one country or region. Trade is conducted under rules which give preference to goods supplied in a way that benefits workers, the local community and the environment. The global flow of technology and information would be encouraged only when and where it can strengthen local economies. </p> <p>Globalisation's advocates want to maximise trade and money flows for profit. From this comes a clear set of policies and trade rules. Localisation reverses this by discriminating in favour of the local (which may embrace a regional grouping of states. At the heart of localisation is a rejection of today's environmentally and socially damaging subservience to international competitiveness. If control of the economy falls to communities and nations social cohesion could be built, poverty and inequality reduced, livelihoods improved. </p> <p>This does not mean a return to overpowering state control. But new rules would have to be enacted to stop imports of goods and services that could be produced locally. Industries will have to be located in the local community if they are to win permission to sell in it. Flows of money would be controlled. Competition policy would discriminate in favour of local production. New resource and pollution taxes would be levied to pay for the transition. </p> <p>Today's global casino consists of traders gambling on minute market fluctuations. In 1980, the daily average of foreign trading was $80bn. Today, more than $1,500bn flows daily across international borders. Some 90% of capital flows are speculative (based on movements in currency and interest rates) rather than productive. Democratic control over such capital is the key to providing the money for governments and communities to rebuild. As well as a Tobin-type tax on international capital transactions to curb currency speculators, broader re-regulation of finance capital will be required. This would include physical controls on capital flows, taxes on short-term speculative transactions, tightening of easy credit that allows speculators to multiply the size of their \"bets\" way beyond the cash required to cover them. Also essential is a widespread and coordinated attack on corporate tax evasion, including offshore banking centres. </p> <p>Any one country proposing such controls on its own would immediately be punished by the markets. However, a regional grouping of powerful states such as the European Union would be a secure and lucrative enough market to ensure that those who control money would not dare to leave the safety and security afforded by such a bloc. This pattern would then be attempted globally. </p> <p>In a small way the process has already begun. Last year two Green members of the European parliament, Caroline Lucas and Jean Lambert, were elected from the UK on a platform that included such localisation. Ms Lucas, as a member of the parliament's trade committee, has initiated discussions about the Europe-wide changes needed to achieve such an end goal. </p> <p>Politically, the 20th century was a battle between left and right. In the 21st the contest will pit localists against those merely trying to manage globalisation. The former will seek control over the local economy. The latter will continue to see globalisation to be as inevitable as gravity; their role will be to attempt to make it kinder and gentler. The contest will not just play out internationally but - if recent protest is any guide to the movement of opinion - in the internal politics of the rich countries, too. </p> <p>Colin Hines is the author of Localisation - a global manifesto, Earthscan \u00a310.99. <a href=\"mailto:chines@dial.pipex.com\">chines@dial.pipex.com</a></p>",
  "William Hague started this week's pre-election conference by promising One Nation politics and he ended four relatively successful days by returning to the theme, promising to govern for all the people and even for all hard working families - the term first coined in the United States by New Democrats such as Bill Clinton and Al Gore. <p>For the true political purpose of this week for the Conservatives was not just to tap into the evident disillusionment with the government, but to reposition the party - and its state educated leader, William Hague - as a party that can reach out beyond its core vote. </p> <p>The loudest cheers in the conference hall were reserved for the familiar attacks on Brussels, section 28 or the dome. But Central Office knew that if they were to be truly ready for government, and the electorate was to be ready for the Conservatives, Mr Hague needed to seize back the issues on which elections are fought and lost: the economy, education and health. </p> <p>Just as George W. Bush's US election campaign is focused on traditional Democrat issues such as schools and health care reform, so Mr Hague knows he has to have something distinctive to say across the policy board. In his closing speech, he tried hard to shift from traditional Tory ground. </p> <p>Alongside the \"common sense\" Tory issues of tax cuts, nationalism and crime, he tried to reconnect with teachers by promising better comprehensive schools, and with doctors by increasing overall spending on health. The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, has promised to spend as much as Labour did in any year of its first term. </p> <p>Yet this concern for the public services does not mean Mr Hague has chosen to return to some kind of post-war or even Majorite consensus on welfare, health and schools. His aides insist there is no ideological contradiction between traditional Tory themes and trying to reach out to new voters. </p> <p>Mr Hague has this week extended the Conservatives' privatisation agenda of the 1980s into areas that Lady Thatcher never considered. His ideology, seen in the round for the first time at this conference, is based on the assertion that the private sector is best equipped to run schools, improve health care and regenerate inner cities. </p> <p>In some cases Labour has travelled the same road, contemplating some private sector school companies, a wider role for private health insur ance, and public-private partnerships in the cities. But the Hague plans are altogether more radical. In education, for instance, he is no longer just promising grammar schools in every town, but that his free schools scheme will allow every state school, largely out of the control of the local education authority, to introduce entry by selection. Many current state schools would be funded by private firms. </p> <p>Similarly, the scale of the revolution being proposed by the shadow health secretary, Liam Fox, in the NHS is potentially vast. Mr Fox presents his proposals as pragmatic and non-ideological. He is promising to match Labour spending on NHS and make private health care more attractive by lifting some of Gordon Brown's taxes on private health insurance. The private sector would complement rather than replace the NHS. </p> <p>This clearly does not represent the privatisation of the NHS, but as Matthew Taylor, the director of the leftwing IPPR think-tank told a fringe meeting in Bournemouth: \"Any insurance based system, however you manage it, will lead to greater inequality of access to health care. Over time, the state system becomes a residual system and any service reserved for poor people becomes a poor service.\" </p> <p>On environment and transport, Archie Norman's radical plans to revive deprived inner cities by setting up regeneration companies and issue bonds to prime and run key services has huge, and so far, ill-explained consequences for local democracy. These pri vately run regeneration companies, on which local councillors would have minority seats, go further than the enterprise zones run by Michael Heseltine in the mid-1980s - with a loosely defined role in taking over failing schools. Even police manpower would in part be brought under control of the private sector. </p> <p>Housing associations and regeneration companies would be free to buy in extra policing to ensure a higher density of uniformed officers. </p> <p>In welfare, drawing on a scheme already in place in various US states, the shadow social security secretary, David Willetts, is proposing that private sector firms should take responsibility for finding work for the unemployed, in effect replacing public sector job centres. In time, the role of the basic state pension would be reduced as younger people would be encouraged to take out private pension schemes funded from the stock market. </p> <p>The Conservatives have been criticised for failing to offer sufficient detail for such a radical programme, but Mr Hague's advisers argue that the aim is to present themes and that they are constantly struggling to dissuade frontbench spokesmen from going into the positioning of desks. </p> <p>But it is a tribute to Mr Hague's revived fortunes that the public is beginning to examine what is potentially the most radical programme to be offered to the British people in many decades.</p>",
  "<b> Ian McEwan</b>, novelist <p>I certainly have smoked cannabis in the past. Ann Widdecombe's remarks about cannabis smoking are ludicrous. The swilling of 14 pints of lager constitutes a far greater social threat than a shared joint. One good development is that this pronouncement will alienate a lot of younger voters and keep the Conservatives out of power. I take heart from this. We've seen enough of them these past two decades. </p> <p><b>Alex Salmond</b>, former leader of the SNP </p> <p>I have never answered the question of whether I have smoked cannabis and I don't intend to now. There are good reasons for not saying. If you say \"yes\" people claim you're encouraging and supporting it and if you say \"no\" it looks like you're a prick. So basically my answer is it's none of your business, but as far as Ann Widdecombe is concerned: I don't agree with her policy. I think she's a very foolish lady. </p> <p> <b> Piers Morgan</b>, editor of the Mirror </p> <p>Do I smoke cannabis? No comment, but you can draw your own conclusions by our front page today. If I ever had smoked cannabis, and I'm not saying I have, I certainly would have inhaled. I'm sure it would have the same effect on me as most people - very little, calming and mellowing. Do I still smoke it? No - not that I ever did. I certainly do not currently partake in any drug taking, but my editing would probably improve if I did. Ann Widdecombe has lectured young people on the perils of having sex, while being a self-confessed virgin. She's now lecturing us on joints, having never been near one in her life. Her comments will have a derisory effect on young people in this country. Ecstasy and other class A drugs are the real problem. </p> <p> <b> Martin Bell</b> , MP </p> <p>I would not be in favour of criminalising people just for smoking marijuana though I am strongly opposed to drugs. I think the present policy of flexible response and caution is right. I've never smoked it myself. I'm so old, it wasn't even a temptation back in those days. It was hardly even heard of. </p> <p> <b> Ben Bradshaw</b>, Labour MP </p> <p>I think it's potty. It's a crack-pot idea. 'Scuse the puns. But the irony of William Hague toasting her speech with a glass of champagne just seems to have been lost on them. The police will tell you how barmy it all is. The idea we should be asking our already overstretched force to take time out from patrolling the streets to criminalise these people is absurd. I'm not answering the question of whether I've smoked it myself. </p> <p> <b> Nigel Evans</b>, Conservative Party vice-chairman </p> <p>I have never smoked cannabis and have turned it down on the few times I have been offered it. Like all so-called soft drugs, cannabis is a gateway to hard drugs. Cannabis is also highly dangerous - it is made up of 400 chemicals. </p> <p> <b> Michael Grade</b> , chairman of Pinewood Studios </p> <p>I'm on the record as saying I have [tried it] and yes, I did inhale. It was all right, not as good as Charlton winning. I don't have a strong view but, by and large, I think it should be decriminalised. I think the police have got better things to do. </p> <p> <b> Eleanor Laing</b>, MP for Epping Forest, and shadow Welsh minister </p> <p>I have never smoked anything, not even cigarettes. I have always preferred gin. At Edinburgh University I must have been to lots of parties where people may or may not have smoked cannabis. It never attracted me. In the law faculty, where I studied, nobody touched the stuff because they didn't want a criminal record. </p> <p> <b> Jacqui Lait</b>, shadow social security minister </p> <p>I tried smoking a cigarette when I was 10 or 11 and immediately gave up because it spoiled the taste of my food. I tried cannabis 10 years later, when I was working for Visnews, and it had the same unpleasant effect. One puff and it was not for me. I couldn't honestly tell you what the taste was like. </p> <p> <b> Jon Snow</b>, newscaster </p> <p>I have tried cannabis. I'm very bad at inhaling because I don't smoke, so I can't say I found it easy. It seemed to me to be perfectly mellow and the only drawback seemed to be the tobacco. </p> <p> <b> Charles Moore</b>, editor of the Daily Telegraph </p> <p>I don't think this is a suitable subject for autobiography. I think the Tories are quite mistaken. I'm against all on-the-spot fines because it gives too much power to the police without legal remedy. I also think it would be a huge burden on the police which would prevent them from pursuing crime that mattered more, and make them unnecessarily unpopular. </p> <p> <b> Stephen O'Brien</b>, MP for Eddisbury and parliamentary aide to Tory party chairman Michael Ancram </p> <p>Have I ever taken a banned substance? The answer to that is no. But when I was a student traveller in Peru in 1978 I chewed a coca cud because it was legal to do that at 9,000ft. I did it for three seconds and was sick. In Bali I was fed a magic mushroom omelette by Australian backpackers who had a good time at my expense. </p> <p> <b> Claire Rayner</b>, agony aunt </p> <p>Oh, of course I smoked it in the 60s - didn't we all try? But no, I didn't like it much. Everyone was trying it and I never believe in condemning something you don't know about, so I tried it but I didn't like it, but I don't like booze either. But alcohol and tobacco do infinitely more harm. I would like to refer Ann Widdecombe to a little bit of American history. Prohibition encourages people: a) to find the product terribly glamorous, and b) sets up a market for wicked people to make a fortune. The only sensible thing to do with cannabis - I'm not going to talk about the others - is to decriminalise it. Any government that has the sense to decriminalise it, shove a hefty tax on it and use the proceeds on the health service, now they would have some sense in them. </p> <p> <b> Roy Hattersley</b>, Labour peer </p> <p>My view of Ann Widdecombe's proposal is that it is impractical to an extent which proves that the Tory party is totally out of touch with 21st-century Britain. I've never taken cannabis, and I never would. I'd be terrified out of my wits. </p> <p> <b> Martin Amis</b> , novelist </p> <p>The proposal is miserably retrograde. Cannabis should be legalised. I've experimented with it myself, but I'm not telling you if I take it now; if I say that she'll be round here, won't she? </p> <p> <b> Anthony Julius</b>, solicitor </p> <p>I wouldn't like to comment on Widdecombe's proposals because I don't know my own mind on the matter. </p> <p> <b> Bill Giles</b>, former BBC weatherman </p> <p>I've never smoked it. I've just not come across it. The job I had in the early days meant you didn't have much of a social life anyway. You used to get the odd one who smoked some wacky baccy, but we did something just as bad, which was drinking a lot of beer. In my day it would have been frowned of because it was just \"horror, horror, horror, it's drugs\" and any drug was under the same title, but now I don't think it would bother too many people. I don't have strong views about it except when it comes to kids. If my child or my grandchild used it I'd probably go ape. I'm not absolutely sure whether it leads to anything else - if not it's not too much of a problem. Unless in 20 years time, like with cigarettes, we find it's been causing lots of damage. </p> <p> <b> Zadie Smith</b>, novelist </p> <p>I have never smoked cannabis in my life ... OK, so I have, but I'm not a huge smoker. I've no objection to it being smoked - it makes people merry. What is there to say about it? It's such an innocuous drug; everyone does it. I would say there are certain people you go to school with who just smoke it forever, and they become quite dull. Ann Widdecombe's idea? I think Ann must have been smoking too much. </p> <p> <b> Andrew Neil</b>, publisher and editor-in-chief, The Scotsman </p> <p>I've never tried it because I'm a rebel and in the 60s everybody was taking it. I didn't like the smell so I'm not happy to be in a room where everybody's smoking it. But if I'm walking down the King's Road and a bunch of kids are coming the other way I'd rather they were high on a bit of weed than tanked up on Carlsberg. I think [Ann Widdecombe's proposal] is bonkers. When you think of all the problems of crime, to start picking up kids because they've got a couple of pieces of marijuana is bizarre. </p> <p> <b> Lewis Wolpert</b>, biologist </p> <p>Everybody smokes dope. The policy is just monstrous, completely out of touch with reality. Have I smoked it? Certainly, of course. Very seldom, now, but I would unhesitatingly have some - and why not? It's lovely. All young people do, too. How dare the Tories interfere. Two-thirds of violent crimes are associated with alcohol. What percentage is involved with pot? Absolutely none. It doesn't make for violence; in fact, you become quite boring. It's outrageous that it isn't freely available. I don't see Ann Widdecombe saying the same things about alcohol. Her speech was impertinent and out of touch. </p> <p> <b> Peter Bazalgette</b>, creative director of Endemol, creators of Big Brother </p> <p>The idea is completely ludicrous, utterly ridiculous. She made herself a laughing stock. Alcohol causes far more problems, and yet she attacks drugs and then downs a glass of champagne. She should be fined for antisocial behaviour. It's fantastically ironic, and pathetic. I have smoked it, the answer has to be yes, like most of my generation. I don't so regularly now, but certainly when I was a schoolboy in the 60s and a student, yes. There are problems with it; there are problems with any substance that intoxicates you. It depends on how it's handled in society. In this case, the law is obviously an ass. The Tories are going in the wrong direction. There are so many more important things to concentrate on. </p> <p> <b> Peregrine Worsthorne</b>, former editor of the Sunday Telegraph </p> <p>It's a ridiculous thing to do - even more ridiculous than the American prohibition idea, which, of course, was a terrible flop. You can't pass a law which a significant minority are not going to pay any attention to. You can't get crazier than that. I have smoked it. It wasn't for me. I'm an alcohol addict, so I didn't need anything extra. But so many friends do smoke it. It's now just a common occurrence. </p> <p> <b> Peter Carter-Ruck</b>, solicitor </p> <p>I resigned from the Conservative Party because of their failure to deal with law and order. I admire Ann Widdecombe, but I don't think that one zero tolerance measure will deal with the problem of drugs. It needs to be dealt with in a far more sophisticated way. A \u00a3100 fine is not enough - some young people would brag about it. A correction course would be better, with instruction on the great harm of drugs. That would be much more effective. I've never tried drugs and I wouldn't risk it. There is such a great danger of becoming addicted. The thing with drugs is that the effect wears off, and then you have to take something a little stronger.</p>",
  "England's senior family judge is expected to rule today that two patients in a state of \"living death\" can be allowed to die, despite the right to life enshrined in English law this week by the Human Rights Act. <p>Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, president of the high court family division, has been asked to decide whether the act, which came into force on Monday, prevents doctors from withdrawing artificial feeding from patients in a permanent vegetative state (PVS). </p> <p>The two women, named as Mrs M and Ms H, are oblivious to their surroundings and have no hope of recovery, according to independent specialists. </p> <p>The official solicitor, Laurence Oates, representing the two patients, had considered opposing applications from their doctors for the go-ahead to withdraw tubal feeding. But yesterday both sides agreed that the right to life, though it places a positive obligation on the state to safeguard life, allows withdrawal of treatment from which a patient derives no benefit. </p> <p>Around 20 PVS patients have been allowed to die since the House of Lords ruled in 1993 that feeding could be withdrawn from the Hillsborough survivor Tony Bland. </p> <p>But the courts have had to consider the issue afresh after implementation of the Human Rights Act, which makes the European convention on human rights part of English law. </p> <p>Mrs M, 49, has been in PVS for three years after an anaesthetic mishap during surgery in a foreign hospital. Ms H, 36, had a heart attack that deprived her brain of oxygen in January, when she was in hospital being treated for pancreatitis. </p> <p>John Grace QC, representing the two north of England hospital trusts treating the women, told Dame Elizabeth that the families in both cases supported the application to withdraw feeding. </p> <p>\"No amount of rhetoric as to the law should obscure the tragedies behind these cases,\" he said. \"Expert independent witnesses agree they are undoubtedly cases of PVS, described as a twilight zone of suspended animation where death commences while life continues - a living death.\" Both patients were the \"victims\" of medical technology that did not exist when the human rights convention was formulated in 1950. But the principles established in the Bland case amounted to \"an adequate protection\" under the convention's right to life provisions. </p> <p>He said this was accepted by Ben Emmerson QC, who is representing the patients through the official solicitor. </p> <p>Mr Grace said doctors had estimated that if life support continued Mrs M could live for 12 years or even longer. If doctors withdrew feeding and hydration, she would die within five to 14 days without distress. </p> <p>A relative had described her as \"someone who was full of life\" who would not want to live as she was now. </p> <p>Ms H, who suffered from severe epilepsy for most of her life, was \"described by everyone as having been a lively and bubbly personality\", said Mr Grace. </p> <p>Artificial feeding had been a constant problem. Her feeding tube had become blocked on September 23, so she was receiving only hydration and drugs. </p> <p> <b>Useful links</b></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.coe.fr/eng/legaltxt/5e.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">European convention on human rights</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/hract\" target=\"_NEW\">Home Office human rights unit</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.open.gov.uk/lcd/\" target=\"_NEW\">Details of the passage of the act through parliament </a><br></p>",
  "A British Airways captain drank the equivalent of 10 pints of beer and had less than three hours sleep the night before he took charge of a passenger flight from Barcelona to London, the makers of a Channel 4 drinking-and-flying expos\u00e9 have claimed. <p>But Chris Salmon and nine other pilots alleged to have flouted rules on alcohol were just the tip of an iceberg, the whistleblower at the centre of the investigation said yesterday. </p> <p>A former BA flight attendant, Caroline Wooliston, 31, said a culture of late nights and heavy drinking was \"endemic\", particularly on short-haul, one night stopovers. \"The extent of the problem had to be addressed,\" she said. \"And someone had to put their head above the parapet.\" </p> <p>The Dispatches programme, to be broadcast next Thursday, reports that Captain Salmon drank at least 20 units of alcohol - including seven bottles of beer and over a bottle of wine - the night before a flight to Gatwick. He was said to have slept in the cockpit for much of flight BA2485 on July 25. </p> <p>His first officer, James Sharples, and a purser and a flight assistant were also in the Barcelona drinking party secretly filmed by Ms Wooliston. Mr Sharples was alleged to have drunk at least 16 units, the equivalent of eight pints of beer. </p> <p>Capt Salmon was heard off camera saying: \"I can't believe I've got to take an aircraft back.\" Three hours before reporting to duty, he added: \"I'm taking it fairly easy gotta pace yourself.\" </p> <p>Earlier, Mr Sharples had told Ms Wooliston: \"I'm gonna do the landing tomorrow because I just fancy the practice, and he'll be fucked.\" </p> <p>Dorothy Byrne, commissioning editor of Channel 4's current affairs programmes, said she had been astonished at the pervasiveness of the culture of heavy drinking that Ms Wooliston had unearthed among BA pilots. </p> <p>\"We filmed six crews and each time we witnessed heavy drinking,\" she said. \"The pilots were not known to us and were not targeted.\" </p> <p>In total, the programme names five pilots who were said to have breached rules on drinking, but producers claimed to have passed evidence against a further five to BA and the Civil Aviation Authority. </p> <p>On July 1, Captain Mark Phillips and his first officer, Jason Owen, were filmed on a night out in Frankfurt before taking charge of a return flight to Gatwick the next morning. Much of the evening was spent in a pizza bar, where, after several drinks, Captain Phillips was filmed recalling an occasion when he \"had been very, very drunk in Copenhagen\". </p> <p>Mr Owen is seen to joke that the amount of beer he has drunk had brought on \"the DTs\". </p> <p>The programme alleges that after Captain Phillips had gone to bed Mr Owen threw a party in his hotel room, where a cabin crew member produced some drinks which were said to have been taken from the plane. </p> <p>Less than seven hours before reporting for duty for flight BA 2715, Mr Owen is alleged to have drunk 12 units of alcohol, with his captain having drunk the same amount. </p> <p>The programme-makers yesterday dismissed suggestions that the pilots were entrapped or enticed to drink to excess. \"We had very clear guidelines,\" they said. \"We never invited them for a drink, all bills were shared to avoid suspicion and we never asked 'anyone for another drink'.\" </p> <p>Ms Wooliston, who regularly drank at similar stop-over destinations while a flight assistant more than a year ago, denied that her presence had altered the social pattern of the pilots featured in the documentary. </p> <p>\"I have seen it before,\" she said. \"I would not say that my presence influenced them in any way.\" </p> <p>BA said it had yet to see the film but had suspended 11 pilots and three cabin crew, all of whom worked on short-haul routes, after the allegations came to its attention last Friday. A spokeswoman said the airline would be conducting an internal inquiry. </p> <p>The British Air Line Pilots' Association attacked the programme for \"its underhand and disgraceful journalistic methods, which could be described as entrapment\". </p> <p>Two years ago a BA pilot, Nigel King, was sacked after breaking the airline's rule on not drinking for before a flight. </p> <p>Last year the pilot of a Virgin Express Boeing 737 resigned after passengers complained he appeared to be drunk. </p> <p>Last month two EasyJet pilots were grounded after claims that they drank a \"small amount\" the evening before they were due to leave Luton airport. </p> <p>Legislation bringing in random alcohol breath-testing for all pilots is to be introduced as soon as parliamentary time permits, the Department of Transport said yesterday. </p> <p>But consultations with the civil aviation authority, European flight regulators and unions have been slow, and the draft legislation, begun under the previous government, has made little progress. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.britishairwaysjobs.com\" target=\"_NEW\"> Working for BA</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.balpa.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">British Airline Pilots Association</a><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.srg.caa.co.uk/srg/icao.asp\" target=\"_NEW\"> International Civil Aviation Authority safety regulation group</a></p>",
  "As convoys of opposition vehicles converged on Belgrade yesterday, a shockwave of protests spread across the countryside. Hesitant riot police stood by, or were swept aside by the popular uprising. <p>In the northern town of Subotica, near the Hungarian border, the arrest of a student activist triggered a rally of 10,000 people in the town square. In the third largest city, Nis, a similar sized demonstration tried to force its way into the local offices of President Milosevic's Socialist party but was persuaded by opposition leaders not to give police a reason to attack them. Water cannon vehicles remained parked. </p> <p>Attempts to block the roads leading to the capital were easily thwarted. Where the police had set up roadblocks they were overwhelmed by the numbers pressing forward. A procession of vehicles carrying 2,000 people was briefly stopped near the town of Smederevska Palanka, 30 miles south of Belgrade, but eventually pushed its way through barricades. </p> <p>Protesters used an excavator to shove aside two lorries laden with sand and parked across the main road from the opposition-held town of Cacak to Belgrade. Police in riot gear did not intervene as a 12-mile-long column of cars and buses, with opposition and Serbian flags fluttering from the windows, ferried 15,000 people into the capital. </p> <p>At other roadblocks, lorries were pushed off the highway while demonstrators negotiated with police commanders to be allowed through. At one blockade, protesters overturned a police car into a ditch. Several thousand people were marching on foot towards Belgrade from the industrial city of Pancevo, six miles to the north. </p> <p>There were more defections to the opposition from the state-controlled media. The Dnevnik newspaper in northern Serbia carried reports on opposition activities and the wave of strikes and blockades. At the strikebound coal mine in Kolubara, where police first gave ground to the crush of opposition demonstrators on Wednesday night, the occupation by miners continued in defiance of the police who had taken over part of the complex in an attempt to prevent widespread power cuts. </p> <p>The strike committee in Kolubara decided to stay put rather than join in the march to Belgrade. \"We are not afraid, we have to keep up,\" a member, Zoran Cvetanovic, said. \"We want to keep our workers in the pits - we do not want them to go to Belgrade because we must persist in our demands and defend ourselves.\" </p> <p>Another strike leader said: \"There should be no confrontation with [the police]. If they know how to make the machines work, then they can make them work. We won't work until the true results of the presidential elections are recognised. Until Vojislav Kostunica is president.\" </p> <p>An opposition leader declared: \"We found the fire in Kolubara, this dynamite that has activated people all around Serbia.\" </p> <p>The 7,500 strikers at Kolubara understood what was at stake. \"I'm not afraid of the police. There's no reason to be afraid,\" said Miljana Ljuba, a 36-year-old who spent 17 years working the pits in a region that until last week solidly supported Mr Milosevic. \"The police are people, just like us. We are fighting for justice.\" </p> <p>\"We are not interested in bloodshed,\" said Milos Maksimovic, 35. \"Milosevic had enough in Bosnia and Croatia. I respect Mr Milosevic. In the past I voted for him. But now we need another man. The opposition is careful - and there will be no bloodshed.\" </p> <p>Under a moonlit night in the wasteland of the massive strip mine, Mr Milosevic's political game of 13 years finally looked to be up. Some strikers even shared a cigarette with police. </p> <p>The machines that dig the coal for the electricity-generating plant were still. The police lurked around the perimeters of the mine like ghosts of the force Mr Milosevic once used to suppress dissent. The miners had simply downed their tools. </p> <p>Ljubisa Petrovic, pensive with slate grey eyes and stubbled beard, worked in the eastern field, one of many mining strips in the complex. </p> <p>\"They called us from D field. They said they had stopped production and decided to strike,\" he said. \"Then everyone who was working stopped working in my field. We just want a confirmation of the opposition win. We know that the votes Milosevic claims were stolen.\" </p> <p>In Serbia's junior federal partner, Montenegro, the presidential adviser Miodrag Vukovic warned: \"Milosevic is still alive politically. He is more dangerous than ever.\" Against a background of fast-moving events, Mr Vukovic also suggested that Montenegro's union with Serbia was essentially dead. </p> <p>\"There is definitely no Yugoslavia,\" he said. \"In Montenegro everything is working perfectly, while Serbia is coming to a standstill. If Yugoslavia still existed we would probably be having anti-Milosevic demonstrations here, but we are not.\" </p> <p>Mr Vukovic said fears Mr Milosevic would stage a coup in this tiny coastal republic to divert attention from the election chaos in Serbia had subsided. \"We are past the worst. The soldiers are now back in their barracks.\" </p> <p>He added that if Mr Kostunica managed to wrest power from Mr Milosevic and wanted to be taken seriously as a democrat, he would need to overhaul all federal institutions and call new parliamentary elections. He said talks would be needed to establish a new union between Serbia and Montenegro. </p> <p>\"This entity need not be called Yugoslavia,\" he said. \"Montenegro is already independent economically and politically.\"</p>",
  "Tories yesterday joined the countryside lobby in opposing the development of greenfield sites by pledging to give local councils stronger powers to control the number and style of new homes, particularly in the booming south east. <p>The shadow environment secretary, Archie Norman, said it was time to \"break the culture of centralisation\", in which governments set housebuilding targets on a national and regional basis. </p> <p>With the Department of the Environment preparing to tell counties in the south east how many houses they should accommodate over the next 15 years, Mr Norman said authorities should instead be able to specify styles of architecture and construction materials. </p> <p>Earlier this year John Prescott, the environment sec retary, said 43,000 new houses annually were needed in the south east - mainly to cater for demand inside the region - representing a 10% increase over the last decade. </p> <p>Mr Norman warned that England was becoming a \"country of identikit houses the same in Kent as in Norfolk\". </p> <p>Pledging that Tories would scrap national housebuilding targets, Mr Norman said Labour was \"hell bent on building on the countryside, extending urban sprawl and destroying villages and towns\". But in the October issue of the magazine Showhouse, Mr Norman conceded that the demand for new housing was such that development would be needed not just on recycled urban land, but on greenfields as well. </p> <p>\"I am a practical guy,\" he said. \"We all live in the real world. I have been involved in development myself and I recognise that unfortunately it is inevitable we will lose some countryside.\"</p>",
  "The scenes in Belgrade yesterday were reminiscent of those across eastern Europe in 1989. Then, in capital after capital, the squares also filled with hundreds of thousands of people, and a beleaguered leadership met behind shuttered windows to make the decisions which determined whether they would cede power more or less gracefully or whether their regimes would go down in blood. <p>It is still an open question whether Belgrade in the year 2000 will go like East Berlin, Warsaw, or Prague or like Bucharest. Perhaps not as smoothly as the first three, but not as violently as the last: one of the few advantages of having your revolution more than 10 years later than everybody else is that some of the pitfalls are more apparent. </p> <p>Everyone now knows the pathology of this final phase - the numbers in the streets, the reluctant or even mutinous security forces, the classical music on the state channels, the weird silence from those usually so vociferous. On the evidence of these vital signs, the end in Serbia cannot be far away. </p> <p>It was not foreordained that Serbia would be the dunce of eastern Europe, delaying for so long the changes the rest of the region began to embrace a decade ago. If it was less prosperous and advanced than Croatia or Slovenia, or than Czechoslovakia, it was still a reasonably modern society and one accustomed to innovate and lead. </p> <p>History is hard to untangle, but it is possible that, had there been a different leadership and less of a heritage of nationalist preoccupations, Serbia could have followed sharply on the heels of the five east European states, as soon as their revolutions made it clear that the peoples of Yugoslavia would have to reinvent their politics as well. Instead, all the other republics in former Yugoslavia preceded her, most recently Croatia, the other laggard. Even Albania, the weakest and most backward of European communist states, made its moves long ago. </p> <p>The appeal of Vojislav Kostunica is not only that he promises to wrest the dead hand of Slobodan Milosevic from the tiller, but that he quite specifically vows to put Serbia back on the 1989 road which it ought never to have left. He does this, as a nationalist, without in any way agreeing that the main blame for the Yugoslav wars falls on Serbia. The blame, Kostunica would say, is certainly not all Serbia's and awaits, in any case, a neutral reckoning. </p> <p>The priority is to get off a path which leads only to more isolation. Serbia must rejoin the east European story, which is one of transformation to a true multiparty state, the establishment of a market economy, and membership in European organisations leading on to a place within the European Union. This is a message Serbs are finally ready to hear. Indeed, the comparison between Serbia now and Serbia 10 years ago has been on everybody's lips. </p> <p>The miners at Kolubara again and again, in talking to reporters, returned to the comparison between their lives 10 years ago, when they made a good living in a country at peace, and their parlous situation now. The young woman who told Maggie O'Kane that Milosevic had stolen 10 years of her life voiced a sentiment that has become widespread. </p> <p>But it is not exact to say that Serbia missed the changes that 1989 brought to Russia and eastern Europe. Rather, as the Yugoslav state disintegrated, Serbia got the worst of those changes and missed the best. It lost an ideology that was already threadbare but acquired nothing to put in its place except a nationalism that became ever more atavistic. It got a multiparty state, but with a concealed single party still dominant and using the old methods of propaganda and media control to maintain that dominance. </p> <p>It got the appropriation of state assets by the smartest and most ruthless members of the old apparatus which happened to one degree or another in most former communist states, but it did not get any genuine economic renovation. It did not get the rule of law but it did get, to an extreme extent, the criminalisation and mafia entrenchment that can also be seen in Russia. </p> <p>The real tragedy of Serbia was that everywhere else in eastern Europe the often fierce nationalism which had survived under the thin mantle of international communist harmony worked with rather than against democratic change. That nationalism was mainly directed against the Russians, and provided a common ground between non-communists and those braver men and women among the communists who, everybody knew, had tried to protect national interests during the Moscow years. In addition, the ruthless ethnic rearrangments that followed the second world war had made most European states more homogenous. </p> <p> But, in Yugoslavia there were no Russians, and nationalism rebounded off neighbours, not a distant superpower. In Serbia, especially, there was a culture of embattlement which saw 20th-century history as a series of threats to the very existence of the nation. </p> <p>Dobrica Cosic, the intellectual whose theories embodied this fear, saw the Serbian essence as at the mercy of the big powers - whether malign like Nazi Germany, or uncaring like Britain and France - and as diminished by Tito's version of communism. With the changes of 1989, it was again threatened - by the economic power of the west and particularly the economic and political steamroller of the European Union, which he likened to a \"huge multinational department store and travel agency.\" </p> <p>This capitalist west did not care about Serbia, or about the Serbs abandoned as minorities in the new states of former Yugoslavia, seeing only industries to be taken over, markets to be exploited and small, weak governments to manipulate. What for other communist societies was a liberation was, for men like Cosic, to go from the frying pan to the fire. Out of such fears - not utterly without foundation - came the wars of the past 10 years, and because of such fears Serbia missed its appointment with revolution. </p> <p>The 1989 revolutions were about embracing the future but also about the past, about lost time, lost possibilities, cruelties and idiocies that could have been avoided. Mark Frankland in his evocative book on the 1989 revolutions quotes Miklos Nemeth, the reformer who was Hungary's last communist prime minister, telling parliament that just as in times of trouble \"our ancestors fled into the swamps and only the reed through which they breathed in air showed above the surface...we too have been submerged and threatening forces have pushed us under the water.\" </p> <p>It has been Serbia's fate to stay beneath the water longer than any other ex-communist society, and to cause its own people and those of the rest of former Yugoslavia much pain because it could not or would not change. But it seems now that finally Serbia's moment has come. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.woollacott@theguardian.com\">martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "For the grand finale, which way would William Hague go? To zero tolerance or caring (but not sharing) conservatism? A dilemma since both soft Portillo and tough Widdecombe drew the audience to their Zimmer frames - none so far finding that crystal definition. But nor did Hague with his \"Governing for all the people.\" <p>The floor was already littered with the week's startling images. Squiffy good, spliffy bad. Fourteen pints makes a man, but a joint puts you in the slammer. No more short breaks to Amsterdam - a positive blood test at immigration within 10 days risks a \u00a3100 airport tax. Two and a half thousand more crazed cannabis smokers in jug, alongside the 78,000 asylum seekers to be locked up. Tally-ho for the party in favour of hunting burglars! But nothing, absolutely nothing to explain how they were going to spend more and tax less. </p> <p>So away sail the Tories to never-never land, where Peter Pan Hague is eclipsed by the two big beasts fighting for his crown. Widdecombe Hook's law-and-order idyll wrestles with crocodile Portillo's penitential tears. The great culture war for the prow of the Marie Celeste is set to become Westminster's best pantomime. Michael wrings his hands and uses \"I\" and \"me\" 50 times in his grand audition, Ann stamps up and down proclaiming there's no such thing as \"social tolerance\". At last the fun is back in fundamentalism. </p> <p>It's unlikely Mr Portillo has changed his scales. He may have taken a course in modernism, learning that the personal is political. Never mind the policy, feel my feelings. \"I\", \"me\", \"my\" politics is clammily involving, hot-breath intimate and above all confessional. Coming out as gay with an asylum-seeking father - what worse could a man own up to in that fearsome Bournemouth hall? A few sessions of hospital portering, touring Spain to rediscover his roots, searching his soul for the humility, truth and light that come after a great fall - here is heroic material for the making of a modern myth. (Did Max Clifford ever offer any advice?) It was a bravura performance. </p> <p>But pause a moment to consider his versatility. Remember his last great theatrical conference role, where he used his defence brief for tub-thumping, intolerant Europhobia: \"Britain is blessed with very brave soldiers, sailors and airmen, willing to give their lives - for Britain, not for Brussels. The European Commission might want to harmonise uniforms and cap badges, or even to metricate them. The European Court would probably want to stop our men fighting for more than 40 hours a week. They would probably have sent half of them home on paternity leave!\" And the finishing war cry: \"Around the world three letters send a chill down the spine of the enemy - SAS. And those letters spell out one clear message: don't mess with Britain. The SAS has a famous motto: Who Dares Wins. We will dare, we will win!\" From Rambo in 1996 to Cliff Richard in 2000 - another year, another end-of-the-pier show. </p> <p>So which way should William Hague turn? Towards Widdecombe's social whips and chains, old Portillo's union flag or new Portillo's I-feel-your-pain? Easy. Hague took it all in. But it was a remarkable dinosaur of a speech, a classic hour of political emptiness that would have any ordinary audience groaning in agony. Riffs of vacuous verbiage wove worn-out airy phrases in and out and back again to nowhere. \"Making the most of being British\", \"I'm in it for you ... for the real people of this country ... who look to the Tories to give them back their country ... for all the people ... decent law-abiding families, hardworking families, with common sense values\", over and over again, excruciating nothingness. Even his debating-society wit would have made a schoolboy wince: \"Less PC and more PCs!\" </p> <p>Where in all this was the substance? More BSE than beef. And yet the dim outline of the coming election lurked within the leaden clouds. First law and order - \"No government has ever been as tough on law and order as we will be.\" Then the real battleground: \"No government has ever been as committed to cutting taxes as we will be.\" This is the crunch, the nugget in the dross. \"Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy\" (a George W Bush line). Yet how will it be done? All week they have billowed out an extraordinary list of spending promises. </p> <p> Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo seems to have been too busy practicing his lines in the mirror to rein in the profligacy of his comrades who have spent recklessly whenever they opened their mouths. More on pensions, whatever Labour offers. As much on schools and hospitals whatever Labour spends, unimaginable sums on locking in asylum seekers. A fortune on more police and yet more prison, stopping what Hague called \"prisoners idling in their cells\". Undisclosed sums knocking down tower blocks, petrol tax cut, more money for farmers and hauliers. (Hague did a good I-feel-your-pain about a hardworking trucker far from home.) </p> <p>Where will it all come from? Three throwaway lines suggest a kind of answer. First there was a glancing reference to Gordon Brown's \"surplus millions\", money the Treasury denies exists unless the Tories plan to spend recklessly like Lawson and Lamont did in the good times, only to bust in the next down-turn. Then there was \"cutting fraud\", that old stand-by of phoney economics. Last and horribly plausible was the source that got just one brief sentence, a pledge to cut \"worthless government schemes\". That can only mean one thing, a slash and burn of all the programmes now rolling out, the ones that rarely catch the headlines. </p> <p>No more to Sure Start for the poorest children, no more counsellors and clinics to cut teenage pregnancy, advisers to help the over-50s and single mothers back to work, the million new nursery, child care, after-school and homework club places - plus all the myriad other \"worthless schemes\" unrolling as yet too slowly to have earned public understanding and support. There are indeed billions to be slashed out there with few but the poor to notice their passing. </p> <p>What can Labour learn from watching the Tories? Plenty. What matters is substance, there is nothing else. Less phrase-making, more intellectual rigour. Talk about hard practical things, admit failures, discuss problems, treat voters like grown-ups not like idiots. Let the next manifesto and annual report be nothing but Gradgrind fact, own up to disappointment, never over-promise, never over-claim. Modesty in success, honesty in failure. Above all no cheap tricks. The terrible leaked Gould memo did killer damage to Tony Blair's integrity. Never again louts-to-cash-point law-and-order lollipops: they convince no one. Leave tawdry opportunism to the enemy. Rein in Jack Straw; rise above, don't outbid Widdecombe. Leave emoting to Portillo. The public is canny, its cynicism often justified. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Potential jurors in the first trial arising from the biggest corruption scandal in the history of the Los Angeles police were told yesterday that an officer murdered two people and buried their bodies in a rubbish dump in Tijuana. <p>But the \"police monster\" who allegedly killed a young man and his mother because they did not come up with the drug money he demanded is not in the dock; he is the chief prosecution witness, former police officer Rafael Perez.</p> <p>The suggestion that Perez, a corrupt officer who turned informer to escape a long sentence for stealing cocaine from a police locker, is also a murderer is the latest twist in a saga that has transfixed the city and seriously damaged police morale.</p> <p>The trial of four police officers accused of corruption, which started this week, is the first opportunity for the full story of police shootings, drug dealing, bribery and planting of evidence to be told in court.</p> <p>Perez's former girlfriend Sonia Flores claims that he has not told the whole story of his wrongdoing, although he has openly admitted taking part in the shooting of a gang member and planting drugs and weapons on criminals.</p> <p>She says that she was present when Perez and another officer, David Mack, tried to extract money from the young man and his mother in central Los Angeles.</p> <p>When the money was not forthcoming, Perez and Mack, who is serving a jail sentence for bank robbery, shot them, Ms Flores claims.</p> <p>They allegedly wrapped the bodies in carpet and drove them south of the border where a corrupt Mexican officer helped to dump them in a tip.</p> <p>A rubbish tip on a hillside outside Tijuana is due to be searched. If the bodies are found, it will seriously damage Perez's credibility, since he claims to have admitted all his crimes.</p> <p>The four officers from the Rampart division - Edward Ortiz, Brian Liddy, Paul Harper and Michael Buchanan - are accused of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, perjury, and filing false reports. They are alleged to have planted evidence on a suspect or given false evidence in a 1996 case.</p> <p>The long process of selecting jurors for the trial has begun but the full opening statements will not be made until next week.</p> <p>\"He [Perez] was no more than a street thug in a police uniform, the likes of which this city has never seen before,\" Barry Levin, for the defence, told 120 potential jurors in the superior court.</p> <p>\"His coldness, his callousness, his evil knew no bounds,\" another defence lawyer, Harland Braun, told the jury panel.</p> <p>The trial is the first of many of alleged corrupt officers. It is expected to expose the way in which one of the police divisions in the city routinely beat up, shot, framed and exchanged drugs with gang members.</p> <p>Since Perez started making hisallegations, more than 100 criminal convictions have been overturned and more than 70 officers have been investigated. Millions of dollars have been paid out in compensation to those framed or wounded by police officers.</p> <p>Perez made his deal for a five-year sentence after being caught stealing nearly $1m worth of cocaine.</p> <p>With time served, he could be free by February, but the effects of his allegations will be felt for many years.</p>",
  "\u0095 Whenever there is a crisis in Israel, your paper turns into an anti-Zionist rag (Palestinians tell-tale wounds, October 5). You have made little effort to interview anyone who isn't vehemently opposed to Israel or Ehud Barak. <p>Like everyone on the left, I'm opposed to Sharon's provocative actions, but they didn't physically harm any Palestinians - who used this as an excuse to attack Israeli citizens at the Wailing Wall for the Jewish New Year and Israeli soldiers throughout the territories. </p> <p> Israel's security forces have behaved like any others around the world ie excessive force to reduce harm to themselves or Israeli citizens. The British do the same in Northern Ireland. Barak has gone further than any other Israeli leader. Relinquishing control over its holiest site would be totally unacceptable to most Israelis, who are likely to re move Barak and replace him with Sharon (or Netanyahu) if he tried to offer this. <br><b>Syd Kaminsky</b><br>Manchester<br>s.kaminsky@leeds.ac.uk </p> <p>\u0095 It is disingenuous of the pro-Arab lobby to maintain that Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount was the cause of a \"spontaneous\" uprising. The riots are the direct result of the major concessions made by Ehud Barak at Camp David, which took Arafat by surprise. It would have suited him if Israel had been shown to be the intransigent partner for peace. It would have reinforced the maximalist approach which allowed him to make unrealistic promises to his people. This approach is a cul-de-sac populated by dreams which have no hope of fulfilment. <br><b>Roger Radford</b><br>Ilford, Essex </p>",
  "The decision to waive extradition claims on certain Provos on the run is another painful, if necessary, part of the peace process, which, along with the premature release of paramilitary prisoners, is undoubtedly fuelling the climate of uncertainty and grievance amongst many law-abiding citizens throughout these islands. <p>One of the reasons for this is a perception that, although the British and Irish governments have delivered many confidence-building concessions to the supporters of both republican and loyalist groups, these organisations have been less than forthcoming. This in turn helps undermine the position of David Trimble, without whom, as you say, the agreement is in serious danger (Leader, October 4). </p> <p> What are desperately needed now, not least before the meeting of the Ulster Unionist party this weekend, are reciprocal gestures from the main paramilitary groups. First of all, it would be highly useful if there were further inspections of IRA dumps that have not previously been examined and, if these dumps have remained intact, a clean bill of health from Messrs Ahtisaari and Ramaphosa. The second is a clear declaration from the paramilitary organisation that those who have been exiled from Ireland, for offending these groups in some way or another or because they were informers, will be ended. It would be entirely wrong if solutions for Provos on the run were not complemented by justice for those on the run from the Provos. <br><b>Harry Barnes MP</b><br>New Dialogue peace group </p>",
  "I came from a hitherto close and loving family. In adult life I've enjoyed regular contact with my parents and two brothers and their families. However, 18 months ago, after 24 years of a dull and loveless marriage, with both children having left home, I left my husband. <p>It was the best decision I could have made. I feel content, my confidence has returned and all my relationships have improved; except those with my family. My parents have curtailed all social contact and regard me with utter contempt and disappointment. They believe me to be selfish and immature for not \"sticking out\" my marriage. My brothers' reactions are identical because my husband was a \"decent guy who did nothing wrong\". </p> <p>I am indescribably hurt and feel terribly ashamed that at the age of 46 I can cry at being disapproved of and abandoned by my parents. Am I in the wrong? My judgment has been shot to pieces. How do I make amends? </p> <p><b> Keep your door open </b></p> <p>You have the same problem as my husband. His parents, too, are very loving to their children but firmly expect them still to be guided by their choices and values. This is deeply wrong. True love comes wrapped around with respect and support: respect that accepts you are the best person to decide what you do in your life, and support for when you make those decisions. Without these, your parents' love is cramping and controlling. But it is still love. </p> <p>I suspect most of the letters on this page will be telling you to dump your parents. You don't have to. Clearly your family is important to you and losing them is causing you deep pain. Keep any doors open that you can. Try to stay on friendly terms with them. Write to them. See if they would engage in family counselling. Above all, don't compromise your position and never think in terms of making amends. You've done nothing wrong. Your parents and brothers have, by refusing their support. </p> <p>Don't allow yourself to feel guilty. You did the right thing in leaving a loveless marriage and ultimately your parents may come to see that. Think about having counselling yourself to help your self-esteem which years of parental (and husband) control may have eroded. And enjoy your new life. <br><b> Name and address withheld</b> </p> <p><b> Carry on with your life</b></p> <p>I divorced 10 years ago for similar reasons to your own, but my children were younger. My parents' reaction was identical. They raged, initially, then cut me off completely, opting to support my ex-husband emotionally, financially and in any other way they could think of (including visiting their solicitor in a bid to somehow remove my children from me by claiming that I was an \"unfit mother\"). </p> <p>I had no contact with them for two or three years until my mother became ill. This changed the situation somewhat. Suddenly I was needed. Like you, I had forged a happy, new life for myself. I had felt bitter towards my parents and had a struggle to overcome my feelings, but knew I would need to feel at ease with my conscience in the future, no matter what had happened, so my partner and I supported them through my mother's long illness and her death, three years ago. </p> <p>I have no regrets at all about my marriage break-up and, like you, love my life now. We do not have arranged marriages in our culture, and do not have to live our adult lives according to our parents' wishes. Carry on with your life and turn to the people who have supported you and love you for yourself and respect your decisions whether they agree with you or not. </p> <p>I wish you the very best of luck with your new life. You know you have done the right thing and that is what matters.<br><b> Name and address withheld</b> </p> <p><b> Continue to send gifts</b></p> <p>Many people stay in unhappy marriages because they haven't got the guts to get out and start afresh, and I deeply admire your courage. </p> <p>Don't take your parents' rejection so hard. Staying in a bad marriage for the sake of young children is fair enough, but doing so for the sake of elderly parents is plain silly. Their certitude of righteousness would be badly shaken if a close friend, or one of their precious sons, also got divorced, so wait and see what the future has in store. And as your parents become increasingly elderly, frail and dependent, they will realise that spurning a devoted and helpful daughter is a case of cutting off their noses to spite their faces. </p> <p>So be patient. In the meantime, steadfastly send cards and small presents to every one of your relatives for every birthday and Christmas as a non-intrusive way of telling them that you care. If their intransigence does not permit them to phone and say thank you, then maybe they are not such a great loss after all. Tell yourself that the alternative would have been to remain in a miserable marriage until the day one of you died. Best of luck. <br> <b> Claude Shields, Bucks</b> </p> <p><b> Don't be pushed around</b></p> <p>It's time to grow up. Your parents and brothers don't approve. So what? Can they stop your pocket money? I'd avoid them all for six months. Don't give them a chance to bully you, because that's all it is, bullying. They rely on your coming back for more, like a little girl desperate for approval. Be very busy. If they do get a word in about your divorce, try a roll of the eyes, an \"Are you still harping on about THAT?\" and change the subject. </p> <p>Your own family, your adult kids, are your most important relationship, and they love and support you, so you know you've done right. You've let your birth family push you around for long enough. (I expect you've endured plenty of criticism, from how you do your hair to how you spaced your babies, all humiliatingly discussed in front of you.) As for making amends, well, look forward a few years. Who's going to be infirm and needing care? And who'll be expected to provide it? You, the \"girl\". If your parents carry on driving you away they'll have a lot of humble pie to eat. Ditch that overdeveloped conscience and LIVE. They'll respect you for it in the long run. <br><b> Name and address withheld</b> </p> <p><b> It's the generation gap</b></p> <p>You don't need to \"make amends\" for your courage in ending a loveless marriage. But you've shaken up the people closest to you and it's easier for them to punish you than think about why they are so uncomfortable. Your parents' attitude arises from a combination of social conditioning and possibly also religious belief, and as such is probably non-negotiable. In their generation, the misery of men and women trapped in regretted, misconceived or abusive marriages was (presumably) made more bearable by the belief that \"sticking it out\" was the right thing to do. </p> <p>The harder (and much denied) truth you face is that love between parents and children is conditional after all - your parents can only accept a daughter they approve of, and that's no longer you. I hope you find the possibility always exists that they may grow to understand. </p> <p>As for your brothers, you have challenged them (and more alarmingly, their wives) to examine their own marriages. Most women work a lot harder than most men to sustain and nurture love, and what you have done today, your sisters-in-law may do tomorrow. Perhaps your treatment is meant as a deterrent! But the rift with your family is hard for you. I hope you find peace of mind.<br><b> Name and address withheld</b> </p> <p><b> Next week</b></p> <p>A year ago my boyfriend and I ended our four-year relationship. Although I decided to call it a day, we continue to be on good terms. On the whole I feel positive about being single. Since my relationship ended I have developed a new network of friends and I have joined several societies. </p> <p>My dilemma is that many of my friends are married with children. I have found that if I wish to see them at the weekend, I have to make the arrangements. I appreciate that they are busy, but I wonder if it is worth inviting people round, who then never invite me back. </p> <p>Recently some friends were invited to a wedding at which my ex-boyfriend was the best man. I had known the groom from university and seen him frequently over the last four years, yet I did not receive an invitation. I was upset that some people who were happy to meet up with me when I was part of a couple no longer want to include me in their activities. </p> <p>I would like to meet more people of my own age (early 30s) who are single. My job involves working with people in their 40s and 50s, so I am unlikely to make friends through work.

  "<p>\"I want to make this film... I'm going to make this film... it's a big feature film. I want a cinema release in a year...\" - Alex Jovy</p> <p>\"My friends said: how are you going to make a feature film? You can't even pay your phone bill. I don't know. I've got a great idea...\" - Leon Herbert </p> <p>That's how the first episode of our documentary series for Channel 4, Movie Virgins, started. And it ended four weeks later with the first-time directors at very different stages in their careers: Alex discovering that he'd landed a distribution deal and Leon still desperate for money to mix, dub and order a final print of his film. They're both in debt. In between, they underwent an extraordinary journey, trying to break into one of the world's toughest industries with no more than a couple of short films to their names. </p> <p>Usually, interest in programmes like this dies away fast after they finish. But not with Movie Virgins. After the series ended, our phone didn't stop ringing. People are still asking us what happened to Alex and Leon, wanting to know when there will be an update. Both of them are stopped in the street, with people offering Leon cash and cheques, and sending scripts to Alex.</p> <p>At first Leon was overwhelmed. From feeling rejected and despondent, he's gone to finding an army of people who want to help him. Alex also received a lot of sympathy for what he went through (anybody who saw him being snubbed by Jude Law in Cannes couldn't have helped but feel for him) but he also encountered hostility from people who thought he'd had it easier than Leon. </p> <p>So where do they stand now? </p> <p>Alex's film, Sorted, goes on general release today. His dream of being able to watch his film along with a paying audience has been realised. And I know what he'll be doing today - rushing from cinema to cinema checking out numbers, monitoring the response and trying to work out if cinemas are likely to continue the booking or drop it the following week. At the end of the day, the only thing the industry cares about is whether people want to see the film. The decision-makers don't really care that he sat in despair in his flat last summer when no one was returning his calls, with only six weeks to go before shooting. If the cinema chains sense an audience, they'll back it. If not... well it's only about \u00a33m on the line. </p> <p>For Leon, Movie Virgins has turned his world upside down. He's no longer just - as one critic put it - a legend in his own block of flats. Choice FM has started a fund-raising campaign, and he's planning a benefit concert before Christmas. And when (not if, he says) he gets funds to complete, he's going to distribute the film himself, booking cinemas and touring it round the country. He calls it an independent revolution. Oh yes, and he's starting three new companies - a distribution company, a web site and a music company (for the CD, of course). </p> <p>The other day Leon spotted Tom and Mel from Big Brother having lunch together in Soho. He bounded up to them. Mel shook her head and insisted: \"I'm just a lookalike\". Undeterred, Leon told them, \"I was on TV at the same time as Big Brother... in fact, one episode of the show was bumped because of Nasty Nick\". Blank looks. \"Anyway\", Leon enthused, \"did you watch Movie Virgins?\" \"No\", chorused the none-too-bright \"lookalikes\", \"we were stuck in the house, weren't we?\" </p> <p>On Wednesday night, Alex had his film's premiere and invited Leon. The press started calling out \"Alex and Leon together\", seemingly wanting a joint photo. It was strange because their stories never overlapped - in fact they met for the first time only recently when we all did a radio interview just after the series began. </p> <p>Alex and Leon have both suggested we carry on filming, even though the programme may never be transmitted. So, for the moment, I will - partly because their stories intrigue me, and partly because I like open-ended documentaries. The foreplay may have happened but the ups and downs of the Virgins have yet to be played out. </p> <p>Sorted is reviewed in the Friday Review.</p>",
  "The European court of justice in Luxembourg threw out the European commission's union-wide ban on tobacco advertising yesterday, ruling that the 1998 directive banning tobacco advertising and sponsorship from 2001 was illegal because it was outside the commission's powers. <p>The directive would have gradually have phased out almost all tobacco publicity and sponsorship by 2006. </p> <p>It fell foul of the court because it was introduced as a single-market measure - which needs only a majority vote - rather than one which requires the unanimous backing of all 15 EU member states. </p> <p>The tobacco companies and advertisers, which brought the case along with the German government, welcomed the ruling. </p> <p>\"It's a huge victory,\" said Volker Nickel of the German advertising association. \"The court showed the EU institutions a red card.\" </p> <p>But the British government promised to introduce its own legislation if a European ban proved impossible. </p> <p>Governments and MEPs are debating proposals to tighten the limits on tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide in cigarettes and require stark new health warnings on cigarette packets.

  "Barbara Castle, the irreducible core of the Labour movement, is 90 today. She will spend the day answering hundreds of pensioners' letters exhorting her to carry on her campaign to restore the link between pensions and earnings. <p>Politics has always been a crusade, and age, near-blindness and a little infirmity are no excuse for slacking off in a life devoted to what she once called \"inching society towards civilised values\". </p> <p>At last week's party conference, the social security minister, Jeff Rooker, called her the \"goddess of the Labour party\". The chancellor, Gordon Brown, once ruefully remarked: \"She is my mentor and my tormentor.\" </p> <p>But she got an invitation to his wedding party last month, and tomorrow he will, among a hundred or so of her closest friends, troop out to her cottage in the Chiltern hills to pay homage. So will the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. </p> <p>In Brighton last week, the prime minister dropped in (with flowers) on her warm-up birthday party, organised by political friends from her long career: 35 years at Westminster, another 10 in Strasbourg. </p> <p>And the home secretary, Jack Straw (who used to be her special adviser), made a warm and generous speech which went a long way to restoring relations fractured by his abrupt swerve to the right. </p> <p>Lady Castle has become the icon of 20th century socialism, a full-colour original stepping out of the pages of history books. When Barbara Anne Betts was born in 1910 into a middle class household committed to socialism, the infant Labour party had just managed to increase its MPs from 30 to 40. She was eight before a woman MP took a seat in the Commons. </p> <p>Her first political message was addressed to the soldiers still out in the Flanders trenches: \"Vote for me, citizuns [sic], and I will give you houses,\" and she has remained unswervingly committed to the cause of the underdog ever since. </p> <p>Slight and stylish, she has bulldozed her way into the history of the left with an integrity which infuriated many of her contemporaries but which now inspires a new generation. In her 20s, she helped to launch the leftwing weekly Tribune (her lover, the socialist writer and theoretician William Mellor, was its editor). She and the future Labour leader Michael Foot read Marx and Dickens shivering beside a gas fire, and she was a parliamentary aide to Sir Stafford Cripps in Clement Attlee's 1945 government. She was a leading Bevanite rebel, and finally, in 1964, she was promoted to the cabinet by her long-time political ally Harold Wilson. </p> <p><b> Energy</b><br> </p> <p>Her commitment to socialism and the energy with which she pursued it did not always make her the easiest of colleagues. \"If she wrote a note for the milkman she would bring socialism into it,\" one detractor observed. </p> <p>But she has left an indelible footprint on the 20th century. She got equal pay past her reluctant male cabinet colleagues, she introduced the breathalyser, she brought in child benefit and the state earnings-related pension. And, of course, she linked the basic pension, by tying increases to earnings, with the nation's rising prosperity. She even built the Humber suspension bridge. </p> <p>Many people (probably, very privately, including herself) thought she could be the first woman prime minister. </p> <p>Newly arrived at the Department of Employment in 1968, she scandalised her officials after an early attempt at mediation in one of the endemic industrial disputes by having a whip-round for the families' hardship fund. Within six months her faith in the trade unions of the 1960s as an engine for reform was shattered. </p> <p>Her subsequent attempt to introduce industrial relations legislation cost her any chance of leading the party. Typically, while Wilson as prime minister tried to bring the party into line by threatening an election, Barbara Castle told her colleagues that it was their right to oppose her and her right to resign (not that she ever did). </p> <p>\"Everywhere she went she made a difference,\" said the Labour peer Lord McCarthy last week. Critics say she was an activist before she was a socialist. But wherever she goes now, she meets people whose lives she has touched - not only pensioners but women who have won equal pay through her legislation, or trade unionists who will now admit she was right to try to change the law. </p> <p>Above all, she still believes that if she argues long enough and hard enough her opponents will finally admit defeat. So not for her the demeaning tactics and trimming of daily political trade. Argument, the conflict between rival points of view, are her life blood, and if you cannot fight back, with facts, you are dismissed. \"The greatest quality in politics,\" she once said, \"is good nerves.\" </p> <p><br><b>Labour's Mentor and Tormentor</b> <br> </p> <p> \u0095 Born October 6 1910 </p> <p>\u0095 Educated Bradford girls' grammar school and St Hugh's College, Oxford </p> <p>\u0095 Became a councillor in the borough of St Pancras, north London, 1937 </p> <p>\u0095 Administrative officer, Ministry of Food 1941-44 </p> <p>\u0095 Daily Mirror housing correspondent 1944-45 </p> <p>\u0095 Labour MP for Blackburn, 1945-79 </p> <p>\u0095 Labour party national executive member 1950-79. </p> <p>\u0095 Minister for transport 1965-68 </p> <p>\u0095 Secretary of state for employment 1968-70 and for social services 1974-76, introducing Serps </p> <p>\u0095 Has campaigned vociferously on behalf of pensioners and the movement to restore the link between the state pension and earnings </p> <p>\u0095 She said recently at a meeting of Age Concern: \"You must never whinge about getting old, but you can swear\" </p> <p>\u0095 Made a life peer in 1990</p>",
  "Arab governments are becoming increasingly incensed at Britain's failure to condemn the Israeli government for the violence of the past week in which scores of people, mainly Palestinians, have died. <p>Most of the anger is directed at the prime minister, Tony Blair, and Downing Street confirmed yesterday that Mr Blair had made no statement since the shooting began. </p> <p>But there has also been criticism of the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and his deputy, Peter Hain, whose reactions to the killing have been muted in comparison with those of other European ministers.. </p> <p>Mr Cook, in his one statement, deplored the killing and said he was distressed at the suffering of the children, but he and Mr Hain have pointedly avoided criticising Israel and have failed to blame Ariel Sharon, the leader of the opposition Likud party, for sparking the rioting. </p> <p>Mr Hain said yesterday: \"The responsibility for the atrocities of the last few days is clear to everybody, but issuing public denunciations gets us nowhere in the urgent quest for peace. We remain very closely engaged in pressing all sides to end the violence and get the peace negotiations back on track.\" </p> <p>Behind the scenes, Mr Cook has had talks with the Israeli foreign minister and the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, and yesterday Mr Hain saw the Israeli ambassador to London and the Palestinian chief negotiator. </p> <p>But an Arab diplomat in London said yesterday that he had the impression that Downing Street was restraining the Foreign Office from making more robust comments.</p>",
  "For the first time since the second world war the far right is on the march in Norway, and real power is within its grasp. <p>According to opinion polls, the extreme right, anti-immigration, Progress party has outstripped the ruling Labour party to become the most popular political force with this affluent country's 4.5m people.</p> <p>Its approval rating has soared as high as 35% and its charismatic leader, Carl Hagen - or \"King Carl\" - is being touted as the next prime minister.</p> <p>With less than a year to go before parliamentary elections are held, alarm bells are ringing and Norway's reputation as a tolerant society is under threat.</p> <p>The Progress party has won support by promising all things to all voters, and by promising to cut taxes and spend more of the country's oil revenue on improving the welfare state. It also wants to bundle the elderly off to Spain, where health care is cheaper.</p> <p>As the party has become more popular, Mr Hagen has done his best to rein in some of its more outspoken members and play down its hardline immigration policies.</p> <p>But his most radical ideas are unchanged. The party's manifesto advocates abolishing development aid to the third world because, it says, the money is spent on \"arms and luxury goods\" for the elite. Poverty, it argues, is a result of poor countries' inability to organise themselves.</p> <p>Norway already operates a restrictive immigration policy but Mr Hagen would go further. A maximum of 1,000 immigrants a year would be allowed, and asylum seekers who broke Norwegian law would be repatriated.</p> <p>The party also wants a national referendum on whether any more foreigners at all should be admitted - Norway has about 250,000 - and it is keen to test new arrivals for Aids.</p> <p>The party is compared by some to Austria's far-right Freedom party and France's National Front, but it insists that it is not racist.</p> <p>\"We're a new political breed,\" says the silver-haired, rather portly, Mr Hagen, sitting in his smart office in the parliament building in Oslo.</p> <p>\"We combine the best from social democratic thinking and the best from conservative thinking.\"</p> <p>Norwegian society is under attack, he warns, and too many immigrants will spark social unrest.</p> <p>\"Let's not be naive and blue-eyed. If you have too many immigrants you will get social conflict. You can like it or dislike it, but that's a fact.\"</p> <p>And, he says, the problems have already begun, especially in eastern Oslo, known as Lit tle Karachi because it has so many Pakistanis.</p> <p>\"We have knives in schools, which we never had before, and we have gangs shooting at each other.\"</p> <p>Asked if ordinary Norwegians feel as he does about newcomers, Mr Hagen is categorical. \"Opinion polls for the last 10 years have shown that they agree with me.\"</p> <p>Akhenaton de Leon, director of the Institution Against Public Discrimination, agrees that hostility against immigrants is widespread and says the rise of the Progress party is a symptom of this. \"We have problems in paradise. Police harassment is rampant in this country, and racial discrimination in the housing and labour markets is widespread.\"</p> <p>He says he has seen intolerance increase in the past few years. Clients have told housing agencies to let property to whites only, even the most menial jobs require unreasonably high language skills, and black people often find it difficult to get into to nightclubs and restaurants.</p> <p>\"Mr Hagen is a clever populist who is dangerous for society,\" Mr De Leon says. \"If he enters into a coalition with the Conservative party it would be a disaster for the integration process in this country.\"</p>",
  "Samar Zidan sobbed as she recalled her teenage daughter's screams. As she does most evenings, Sukina logged on to an internet chatroom earlier this week at her home in Haifa, only to discover that one of her friends was among 11 Israeli Arabs killed in the week's violent protests. <p>With a few key strokes the lives of mother and daughter were changed forever. \"A 15-year-old suddenly realised we are two nations who hate each other, and that the other one can suddenly kill her friend,\" Mrs Zidan said yesterday. </p> <p>The protests by Israeli Arabs which have convulsed the Arab heartland, Galilee, and penetrated mixed areas of Tel Aviv and Haifa, led to the worst ethnic violence in Israel since the state was created in 1948. </p> <p>Perhaps no death captures the feelings of betrayal and despair that have engulfed Israelis - Arabs and Jews - more than that of Sukina's chatroom friend, Asil Asleh. </p> <p>For an Arab teenager Asleh, 17, had an unheard-of circle of Jewish friends, whom she met through Seeds of Peace, an American summer camp for Jewish and Arab teenagers. </p> <p>His father, who described his death yesterday to a hushed crowd of Israeli Arab activists trying to make sense of these bloody days, says he was first beaten by soldiers and then shot in the neck. </p> <p>His audience, professionals mainly, Hebrew speakers and veterans of peace and human rights organisations, have had their dream of co-existence between Israeli Arabs and Jews destroyed by the security forces' killing of Asleh and 10 others. </p> <p>It is also raising uncomfortable questions about the effectiveness of decades of peaceful efforts to secure equal rights for Israel's Arab minority. </p> <p>\"Something very urgent has happened in relation with the state of Israel and our Arab citizens of Israel,\" said Mohammed Zidan, who heads a human rights organisation in Nazareth. </p> <p>\"Even if there will be an agreement in the West Bank and Gaza, if there is no solution dealing with the Palestinians in Israel there will never be a real peace. The situation is ready to explode.\" </p> <p>The soul-searching has its mirror image among Israeli Jews. But their conclusions are profoundly, and disturbingly, different. Across the political spectrum, few Israeli Jews doubt that the army had any choice but to open fire on Israeli Arab protesters, and they believe that Arab members of parliament played a huge part in provoking the violence. </p> <p>Israeli Arabs see this week's violence as an explosion by a community torn between sympathy for its Palestinian cousins and its situation in Israel. Palestinians who chose citizenship rather than exile when Israel was created, and their descendants, make up 18% of Israel's population. </p> <p>Although they are far better off economically than those in Palestinian-controlled areas they suffer systematic discrimination in jobs, schools, housing and social services. </p> <p>Since 1948 no new Arab town has been built in Israel, and until this year Arabs were legally barred from buying land and building homes in much of Israel. Their towns are crowded and dirty. Much of their traditional landhas been confiscated by the army and kibbutzim and for the controversial road now being built which will slice through the centre of Israel. </p> <p>In Galilee the frustration was brought to the boil earlier this year when a speeding Arab motorist was shot and wounded by an Israeli police chief. Arabs say the police chief is racist; the Israeli authorities have refused to transfer him. </p> <p>Such nuances are lost on most Israeli Jews, who see this week's explosion as sheer treachery, and criticise the prime minister Ehud Barak's attempt to bring reconciliation as pandering to an uppity minority. </p> <p>The liberal newspaper Ha'aretz said in a commentary yesterday: \"What is taking place in the streets of Arab towns and neighbourhoods is - why should we continue to deny the fact - a revolt. A revolt against the Jewish majority in whose midst they live, and a revolt against the very democracy in which they are citizens.\" </p> <p>The divide is an accurate expression of the way the two peoples live. Few Jews have Arab friends; there are only two or three experimental schools where the children of both communities study together. In their segregated neighbourhoods in such cities as Haifa and Accre, the two communities live separate existences. </p> <p>Still, many thought they were making progress. At last year's elections many Israeli Arabs voted Mr Barak. They believed he was sympathetic towards the campaign for equality, which has been gaining momentum for the past five years. </p> <p>Many thought the Israeli-Palestinian peace process had put the days of confrontation behind them, and that the growing prosperity from Israel's hi-tech boom would gently erase the other frictions. </p> <p>\"I never voted. I never demonstrated. I did not want to raise my kids with this stupidity: should you be an Israeli, or should you be an Arab,\" Mrs Zidan said. . \"I thought I could put the whole question in a drawer.\" </p> <p>This protests have shaken that belief. So did her conversations with Jewish acquaintances, which convinced her that a wall had gone up between them. </p> <p>\"I thought that this week was the maximum, that things could get no worse,\" shesaid. \"But now I really think Israelis have a psychological problem of denial. I live in a Jewish neighbourhood, and they just do not see me.\" She corrected herself: \"They don't see us, and we don't see them.\" </p> <p><b>Burden of inequality</b></p> <p><b> The law</b> </p> <p>\u0095Israel grants automatic citizenship and residency to Jews under the law of return, but not to non-Jews </p> <p>\u0095The Jewish National Fund, which owns or administers most of the land, bars its sale or lease to non-Jews </p> <p><b> Housing</b> </p> <p>\u0095No Arab town has been built since Israel was proclaimed in 1948.

  "<p>Kevin Keegan will have woken up this morning hoping that knee news is good news. He will be anxious to check the fitness of David Beckham, whose presence in the side against Germany at Wembley tomorrow will be crucial to the England coach's hopes of beginning the 2002 World Cup qualifiers with a victory. </p> <p>Beckham, now the vice-captain, is almost certain to play but, until he has run a final test on the knee problem which has nagged him for a fortnight, England cannot be sure of the Manchester United man's services in a match which, along with Wednesday's game in Finland, will go a long way towards deciding Keegan's future in charge of the national team. </p> <p>Yesterday Beckham declared himself 95% fit and confident of starting against the Germans. Yet he did add the caveat that \"if it's not right and I feel I could break down after 25 minutes obviously I'd tell Kevin Keegan\". </p> <p>Beckham trained yesterday for the first time since reporting for international duty on Monday night and even then it was not a full session. \"I did some crosses and some shooting and that's the biggest part really, kicking a ball,\" he said. \"I've just got to see what the reaction is in the morning. It's fine at the moment.\" </p> <p>He first suffered the injury two weeks ago and aggravated it on Sunday towards the end of United's match at Arsenal. \"I'd just been carrying on with it niggling away,\" he said. \"Then I kicked a ball in the last two minutes of Sunday's game, caught it wrong, and it seemed to go again. </p> <p>\"Over the next couple of days I was limping,\" he continued, \"but I had some more treatment half an hour ago and it feels good at the moment, so I should be fit for Saturday. However, tomorrow's the day when I decide and the manager decides whether I'm fit or not.\" </p> <p>The possible loss of Beckham, however unlikely, will have alerted Tottenham's Darren Anderton, who has made an unexpectedly rapid recovery from his latest groin strain and has been put on standby by Keegan in case of injuries. But with Kieron Dyer, another knee casualty and England's biggest doubt, taking part in training yesterday, Keegan may ultimately be more concerned about Beckham's role than his fitness. </p> <p>Beckham was employed in central midfield when England drew creditably with France in Paris last month. Afterwards both the player and the England coach felt he would need several more games to get used to the change of role, and it will be a surprise if Beckham does not find himself back on the right flank against Germany. </p> <p>\"I'd rather stay in the middle,\" he admitted yesterday. \"I've had two games for England in that position, against Argentina and France, and I think, if I get a run, I could stay there. </p> <p>\"I'd like to score more goals [his record for England is one in 35 appearances]. In France I had two or three shots whereas in other games I've had just one so the central position does give me a chance to get forward more. </p> <p>\"But it's not up to me to decide the team,\" he added. \"If the manager thinks I should be on the right for certain games and in the middle for others that's entirely up to him.\" </p> <p>The only way Beckham might play alongside Paul Scholes in midfield tomorrow would be if Keegan felt he needed to start with the extra pace Dyer brought to England's right flank when he came on for the last 20 minutes at the Stade de France and laid on Michael Owen's late equaliser. Dyer, however, is almost bound to be on the bench again. </p> <p>Another possibility which may struggle to become a reality concerns the use Keegan could, if he wished, make of the rare opportunity open to him of playing two naturally left-footed players on the left wing. </p> <p>Graeme le Saux's recovery from injury after a 10-month absence will probably see the Chelsea player recalled at left-back tomorrow, but so successfully did Aston Villa's Gareth Barry perform in this position against France that Keegan could retain the 19-year-old in defence and use Le Saux on the left side of midfield. Unlikely, perhaps, but Le Saux and Barry were working in tandem for a time during practice. </p> <p>Tomorrow's game, the last at Wembley before the 77-year-old stadium is demolished, will echo with memories of 1966 and all that. But in case Keegan's players had not got the message, a stuffed lion, courtesy of Shepperton Studios, turned up at Burnham Beeches yesterday to remind them. Oh well, better for lions to be stuffed there than at Wembley. </p> <p> <strong> England </strong> (possible; 4-4-2)<br>Seaman; G Neville, Keown, Adams, Le Saux (or Barry); Beckham, Gerrard, Scholes, Barmby (or Le Saux); A Cole, Owen. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
