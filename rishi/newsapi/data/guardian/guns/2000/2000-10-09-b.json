  "<p>The UK is at the forefront of a global boom in mergers and acquisitions (the takeover of one company by another), investing abroad last year more than any other country. Mega deals, such as Vodafone's takeover of AirTouch and BP's of Amoco, resulted in foreign investment from the UK worth almost $200bn in 1999, leapfrogging America as the biggest outward investor for the first time since 1988. The chart shows UK in and outflows compared with France, traditionally also a big investor. </p> <p>For the chief executives of acquiring companies and their advisers, such deals bring golf-club bragging rights and enormous financial rewards, yet results for their shareholders are often disappointing. Studies keep showing that most mergers fail. The shares of the company being acquired often rise in value but those of the predator fall. A KPMG study last year showed that 53% of mergers destroyed shareholder value. Mark Sirower, a professor at New York University and adviser to Boston Consulting Group, puts the failure rate at about 65%. </p> <p>Given the portents, it would not be unreasonable to expect bosses everywhere to give up on acquiring new firms and concentrate on organic growth. Instead, the pace of mergers is accelerating, not just within countries but between them too. Figures collected by the UN conference on trade and development (Unctad) show cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) drove foreign investment volumes to a new record of $856bn last year. It reckons the total may well pass $1,000bn this year. </p> <p>Most deals are conducted between firms in the developed world. Companies based in the EU were the most acquisitive, with the UK accounting for 39% of total EU outflows. The boom in Europe is being driven in part by the arrival of the euro, which contributes to greater price transparency and increased competition, putting more pressure on firms to restructure and consolidate their operations. </p> <p>It is also a facet of globalisation and the desire of companies to become top dog, not just in their native country or region but the world. In the same way that a global marketplace for goods and services is emerging, so too is one for firms. The process is aided by information technology which makes distant business units easier to manage; changes in financial markets, which allow deals to be financed through share swaps rather than cash; and deregulation. </p> <p>The market expects corporate leaders to deliver double digit growth every year. The only way to do that, especially in mature industries, is to buy other companies, thereby gaining instant access to new production and strategic assets. Yet, by buying other companies, bosses put their own company at risk of failure. However, trying to grow the business organically is not an option either because of the danger of being left behind by competitors if one of their takeover deals defies the odds and succeeds. </p> <p>Part of the motive for doing such deals is that it allows chief executives to boast. Yet mistakes made in the thrill of the chase can be very costly to the individuals concerned. The collapse of the planned merger between the two Ger man banks Deutsche and Dresdner earlier this year tarnished the reputations of both. Deutsche Bank's management was exposed as divided and confused. Dresdner lost Bernhard Walter, its chairman, who resigned. Senior members of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, its investment banking unit, walked out. </p> <p>If collateral damage were limited to a few high-profile resignations, the M&amp;A boom would not be a cause for concern. But the ramifications are often felt across a much broader horizon than the individual and the company. </p> <p>In the developing world, foreign direct investment is dominated by so-called greenfield investment, that is the establishment of new foreign affiliates. But cross- border M&amp;A activity is on the rise there too, accounting for a third of foreign investment in 1999. Greenfield investment is regarded as a good thing for generating new jobs and providing a more stable source of foreign capital than hot money flows into shares or other financial investments. But the impact of M&amp;A on development is double edged and uneven, says Unctad. Rather than adding to productive assets in a country, M&amp;As simply transfer ownership of existing ones. In the case of a firm which would otherwise go bankrupt, the arrival of a new foreign owner is obviously beneficial. But often transfer of ownership can lead to job losses, not gains, as the acquiring company reorganises production in line with its corporate strategy rather than to the benefit of the host country. </p> <p>Foreign investment carried by M&amp;As can also threaten competition. Acquiring companies may get a stranglehold on an industry, restricting choice and keeping prices high. Developing countries rarely have effective competition policies to counter such threats. </p> <p>Unctad draws parallels between the emergence of a national market in the US at the end of the 19th century and a global one today. Then, a massive M&amp;A boom and resulting concerns about competition prompted the federal government to develop anti-trust legislation (today the US has one of the most effective competition regimes in the developed world). Now that the world economy is experiencing a similar transformation, a global response is required to safeguard consumer interests. </p> <p> Mark Atkinson is the Guardian's economics correspondent </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mark.atkinson@theguardian.com\">mark.atkinson@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Dot.conservatives</strong><br>The Monkey heartily applauds the Conservative Party's latest brave stand against the shocking political bias of that commie-pinko-shirtlifting collective that masquerades as the nation's public service broadcaster. Obviously wanting to do our bit to help expose the hordes of subversive degenerates hiding under beds at the BBC, we feel duty bound to draw Central Office's attention to seethru.co.uk, the so-like-a-real-website-its-incredible website for BBC2 dot.com drama Attachments. Said site contains a thinly veiled attack on the shadow home secretary's brave stand against that hardcore criminal element, cannabis smokers, under the headline \"Widdecombe you hilarious clown\". This is an outrageous misrepresentation of the facts and a clear example of political bias - La Widdecombe has never been funny in her life. </p> <p><br><strong>Barely believable</strong><br> Kevin Brown, founding partner of Soul and a successful and no doubt wealthy ad man, is simply unable to resist starring in his own ads. However, friends of his have this week admitted he's now taken things too far by stripping down to the short and curlies - something he appears to have plenty of - for the sake of the Daily Star's \"MegaStar\" campaign. The poster features a nude - and rather flushed - Mr Brown covering (just) his modesty with a board advertising the site. Mark Cranmer, chief executive at Starcom Motive and a dear friend of his, said: \"Kevin has a long history of exhibiting himself. He's done ads promoting gambling, alcohol and now blatant sex. I feel he should have asked for his legs to be retouched, though, because he seems to be suffering from the skinny legs/far gut syndrome that comes to all men as they get older. I love Kevin, but he is mad.\" Even one of Kevin's co-founders is advising people to turn a blind eye to the stunt. \"I wouldn't look at it if I were you - you might find it offensive,\" he said. You're not wrong, Duncan.</p> <p><strong>Caught out on a techie point</strong><br> Programmers panning TV shows? Geeks up in arms about TV stars? What the heck is going on? Anyone would think the BBC had made a show about a dot.com start-up. TV audiences may be unimpressed by This Life 2, the one set in a new media start-up and called Attachments, but those whose lives BBC2 is trying to mimic are even more unimpressed. True, World Productions may have done some homework, but those finicky techies are taking umbrage at any slight faux pas - such as transferring files by throwing floppy disks across the office and talking about downloads and demos as a revenue model. Those that haven't vented their spleen already are invited to do so at Everyonehatesattachments.com. But be careful, these hardcore new media types don't take prisoners. </p> <p><strong>Invaluable sentiment</strong><br> Granada Media chairman Charles Allen began his first address to troops of his newly acquired United News &amp; Media by declaring how much his company values programme-makers. Not such a surprising sentiment, you'd imagine, coming from the boss of a company with a significant TV production arm - but the jaws of senior United TV execs hit the floor all the same. Apparently the only word they were used to hearing from former boss Clive Hollick in the same sentence as \"value\" is \"shareholder\".</p> <p><strong>When the caption fits...</strong><br>Sir Christopher Bland got a morning grilling from the delectable Sophie Raworth (isn't Jeremy looking fetching too with his matching purple tie?) on BBC breakfast news today. Pity about the caption though, which read: \"Fiona Mannion: mini owner\".</p> <p><strong>expectingcomplaints.com</strong><br>Monkey apologies for allowing a cad like Danny Kelly to blatantly pull the wool over readers' eyes in Monday's edition of the Media Guardian. Asked about his favourite websites, Kelly named expectingrain.com and woolyrockstars.com. Pernickety readers, i.e. those that go through absolutely everything with a fine-tooth comb, immediately pointed out that the latter website does not in fact exist. More importantly neither the .com or the .co.uk domain names for Woolyrockstars have been registered. Was Kelly making a mockery of us all or was he merely pointing out a new market niche? Kelly says neither: \"I'm very much afraid this thing does exist. The url, however, is woollyrockers.com. Check it out!!\" Duh! Monkey did and fell in love with the Bee Gees doll. Could Kelly have created a monster? </p> <p><strong>Minutes matter</strong><br>What's this? The BBC's famously impartial news reporting standards slipping over its own 10pm news bulletin announcement? The Monkey has got its paws on an internal email from BBC Online producer James Thornet that was sent round after the news broke to BBC online hacks out in the sticks. He draws his colleagues' attention to the fact that the switch to 10pm means the regional bulletin tacked on at the end of the proper, grown-up news will be extended to a massive six-and-a-half minutes. \"We must put this story at the top of online news stories asap,\" says the excitable Thornett. Is he worried viewers in the regions wouldn't notice the difference otherwise? </p> <p><strong>Only slimline warriors need apply</strong><br> Monkey has received an email from Rainbow network, home of Xena fans (see proud to portly, below), anxious to set the record straight. \"Firstly, the generosity of Channel 5 in offering Rainbow a box of T-shirts goes without saying - we were delighted to receive them, and we had loads of entrants to the competition in which they were the prize. On opening the eagerly awaited box of goodies, however, we could tell straight away that there was no way, with the best will in the world, anyone other than a small teenager or large Teddy bear was going to be able to get into them.<br> We closed the competition as images of irate readers struggling to get an arm in a size 6 garment sprang to mind. As Tamara, the Xena co-ordinator at Channel 5, said: 'Annoyingly our merchandise person fits these and didn't consider the more womanly figure, ie me.' We're with you, Tamara! <br>Some lucky winners did decide to hang on to their prizes, although we still have 35 or so here in the Rainbow office. Send us your address and we'll happily send you one.\" Monkey is unsure about being compared to a large teddy bear, but may well have to take up Rainbow's kind offer in the spirit of investigation. </p> <p><br> <br> <strong>Sticky gimmicks</strong><br> Monkey was amused to discover an overflowing pot of honey in the post today. The honey pot subsequently attacked all surrounding computers and made everything in the office sticky. Eugh. The penny finally dropped when Monkey found the attached (and at this point very sticky) note, saying that eBay was stickier than QXL. Point taken. But did it really have to destroy my workspace to tell me that? <br> <br> <strong>Clash of the dot.com giants</strong><br> Plunging dot.com stock prices are nothing new, but the long-term ramifications are starting to impact heavily on those big boys we call Amazon and eBay. Rumours have started to surface about a mooted merger between the two e-commerce giants, which have both been rocked by the recent downturn in dot.com fortunes. A tie-up would make sense, particularly for Amazon, which is struggling to convince investors of its long-term earnings. Perhaps it should take a leaf from eBay's gimmick book and start sending out plants and pots of bottled Amazon river water to prove to investors that Amazon can make things grow. Just a (naff) suggestion. <br> <br> <strong>Proud to portly</strong><br> Channel 5 kindly sent 50 of its finest Xena, Warrior Princess T-shirts to the gay and lesbian website Rainbownetwork.com for a competition giveaway, on account of the pigtailed one being terribly popular with the target audience. Channel 5 was staggered, then, when Rainbow very apologetically sent them all back. It seems the T-shirts are of the cropped belly button-baring variety and, after a bit of market research in the office, Rainbow discovered they were too petite for its users. Seems a shame to let them go to waste, so Monkey is happy to try to squeeze into one to show support. <br> <br> <strong>Bad taste sensation</strong><br> GMTV managing director Christopher Stoddart is so concerned about reports of tasteless office banter that he has issued an email to all staff reminding them of the company's equal opportunities policy. In a carefully worded memo, he also reminded staff of the company's grievance procedure and told them that they mustn't feel frightened of whistle-blowing on their bosses. \"From time to time we will be drawing your attention to important company policies which we all need to follow. Our equal opportunities policy is particularly important because its scope is both on-screen and off-screen,\" he wrote. \"Should any employee have a complaint under this policy [or for any other reason] he should feel free to raise the matter.\" He continued: \"If it concerns their line manager, then they may wish to consult personnel.\" Who on earth has prompted this and what on earth did he or she say? Answers on the back of a cornflakes box, please.<br> <br> <strong> Rings a bell</strong><br> Readers of the Scotsman who also take Sunday Business may be suffering from a sense of d\u00e9ja vu. A few weeks ago top Sunday Biz hack Richard Northedge wrote a coruscating profile of some suit or other doing something fantastically important in the City. Two weeks later a frighteningly similar article (exactly the same except for two small amendments) appeared in the Scotsman's revamped business section, albeit under a different byline. Perhaps Northedge should sue for plagiarism. But then the ed-in-chief of the pink Sunday is one Andrew Neil, who is also in charge of the Scotsman. Other Sunday Business hacks should expect further doppelganger copy to start appearing north of the border under increasingly ludicrous invented bylines. </p> <p> <strong>Not quite all over for Wembley commentator</strong> <br> The man who coined the immortal phrase \"They think it1s all over...\" really did think Wembley was going to be all over without him. Kenneth Wolstenholme, commentator at the historic 1966 England World Cup victory at Wembley over Germany, hadn't been invited to the England-Germany match on Saturday, the final game before the stadium is demolished. Now Sport First has hired the game's most memorable voice to write about the last match. What a joy, says Kenneth.

  "<p>Of the 10 men who have been in charge of the England football team over the past 54 years, Kevin Keegan will be remembered as a cheerleader who denied Wembley one last hurrah and then quit while he was behind. </p> <p>Keegan's sudden resignation five minutes after his team had lost Saturday's World Cup qualifier 1-0 to Germany concludes the most bizarre period yet in the quirky history of national managers. </p> <p>The England coach had taken over 20 months earlier following the Football Association's decision to sack Glenn Hoddle once the prime minister, put on the spot in a day-time TV chat show, had muttered that if Hoddle really had implied the disabled were paying for the sins of past lives he ought to go.</p> <p>In view of what has happened now Hoddle might have been referring to the FA international committee, for if ever a body is reaping the whirlwind of past misdeeds it is surely this one. </p> <p>Bobby Robson took England to the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup but his contract was not renewed, Terry Venables had already decided not to sign a fresh contract by the time England reached the last four of Euro 96, the committee having expressed doubts about his legal wrangles with Alan Sugar and the Department of Trade and Industry, and Hoddle's sin was to express his beliefs clumsily to a national newspaper. </p> <p>The timing of Keegan's departure was totally predictable. His temperament and lack of tactical nous made him a bad choice from the start. </p> <p>When he originally agreed to take the job for four matches, while remaining manager of Fulham, Keegan promised that the players would sing the national anthem with passion and bring a similar mood to their performances. Well, not all of the team were singing before Saturday's match and not enough of them were in harmony during the game to form a barber's shop quartet.</p> <p>Keegan also stressed that in no way would he leave Fulham once his four-match stint had ended. After two games in charge, however, he decided that \"it's time to stop playing games - I want the job\". On Saturday he again decided it was time to stop playing games, only now he believed he was not up to the job after all. In other words after taking the England post saying I'm sorry I'll read that again he has abandoned it admitting I'm sorry I haven't a clue. </p> <p>Keegan's plea of mea culpa - \"I'm blaming nobody but myself. I wasn't good enough\" - the revelation that during England's awful first half that he did not know what to do, his apparent self-sacrifice in order to hand the squad over to someone with more knowledge and the hardly original thought that he wants to spend more time with his family will cut little ice with experienced Kev-watchers. </p> <p>He has walked out after a defeat that made it imperative that he stayed for at least four more days in order to give England the best chance of repairing the damage, serious though hardly mortal, to their chances of qualifying for the World Cup caused by an initial home defeat. Instead of which Howard Wilkinson, the FA's technical director, will again pop up like George, the inflatable automatic pilot in Airplane, to take over the team for Wednesday's qualifier in Finland.</p> <p>When Don Revie quit on England during a World Cup qualifying campaign the FA tried, unsuccessfully, to ban him from football for 10 years. True, Keegan did not conduct covert negotiations with the United Arab Emirates before giving his resignation exclusively to a newspaper but his defection is scarcely more admirable. </p> <p>If, as he insists, he enjoyed the full support of everybody at the FA from the chairman to the Lancaster Gate cat then surely he could have given the job one more chance. </p> <p>Keegan's excuse that the fans who clamoured successfully for his appointment had helped him make up his mind on Saturday by booing him as he left the arena is barely worth consideration. If every England manager had walked out after being jeered at Wembley Alf Ramsey, Ron Greenwood, Bobby Robson, Graham Taylor and Glenn Hoddle would not have lasted anywhere near as long as they did.</p> <p>According to Adam Crozier, the FA's chief executive who has limited experience of these things: \"It is never easy to say I'm not going to be England coach any more. To walk away from that is a very courageous thing to do.\" Yet surely it would have been even more courageous to stay put, tough it out, and risk the probability of being ditched by the FA if the team also lost in Helsinki. </p> <p>It is not as if Keegan had a rough ride from the media, who let him down relatively lightly after the debacle of Euro 2000. Keegan was never vilified in the press as Robson was more than once. He was never lampooned as cruelly as Taylor nor hung out to dry like Hoddle. The heat in Keegan's kitchen barely rose above gas mark one. </p> <p>Crozier was nearer the mark, albeit unwittingly,when he observed that \"I think Kevin Keegan knew he was making the right decision for Kevin Keegan\". That is surely the point. </p> <p>On Saturday Keegan made all the right self-deprecatory noises in the interviews. He is a master of the soundbite and it is a pity that his tactical know-how in handling reporters' questions was not matched by an ability to organise the England team. </p> <p>\"I just feel that for Kevin Keegan there is nothing more in football I want to do,\" he said a trifle wistfully. Presumably this precludes returning to TV as a soccer pundit. Surely he can never sit in judgment on England again having admitted that he did not know enough when he was in charge.</p> <p> o You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Somewhere in a dusty folder in a rusting filing cabinet deep in the basement of Lancaster Gate, there is a piece of paper listing the rules for appointing the national team manager. And uppermost among them is that the job can only be awarded to an Englishman. </p> <p>But the Football Association's chief executive Adam Crozier has already made it clear that the New FA, as they might be called, are ready to tear up the rules and appoint the best man, whether from Tooting or Timbuktu. </p> <p>Unless, while reworking the rulebook, the FA tear up an unwritten law of football politics - never to forgive or forget old enmities - by reappointing Terry Venables, the FA may actually have little option other than to appoint a manager for whom English is a second language. They came close enough with Glenn Hoddle. </p> <p>Though Venables is unlikely to return, he cannot be discounted because his many supporters have already got the bandwagon rolling and, under Crozier, the FA likes to be seen as an administration that has more listening skills than the government. </p> <p>Frighteningly, Howard Wilkinson, the FA's technical director and acknowledged as the most unreconstructed long-ball man in England, now seems to be putting himself in the frame. </p> <p>If he and Venables are ruled out, the FA would have only 11 English Premiership managers to choose from and two of those, Hoddle and Bobby Robson, have already had the job. If they are not considered it is a painfully thin-looking list. </p> <p>You can tell that by the way John Gregory, who has done a decent job at Aston Villa without threatening to make them either successful or entertaining, is once again listed as one of the favourites. But the only two serious candidates, Bobby Robson apart, would seem to be Peter Taylor and Bryan Robson and both would be considered something of a gamble. </p> <p>As brilliantly as he did as the England Under-21 manager Taylor is only two months into his first Premiership job at Leicester and may be unable to work with Wilkinson, who took Taylor's international role with considerably less success. </p> <p>Bryan Robson has had limited success as manager of Middlesbrough. But his main problems have been caused by some disastrous transfer dealing, which would not be a factor with England. </p> <p>The FA's priority in making their decision must not be convenience but getting the right man, though foreign candidates such as France's World Cup-winning manager Aim\u00e9 Jacquet and the sacked Internazionale coach Marcello Lippi have the benefit of being available as well as possessing the right credentials.</p> <p>Of course, if we are to have a foreigner, we might as well have one of our own, so to speak, with the Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger the outstanding and most obvious choice. The FA, though, would face a messy and protracted fight with Arsenal to gain his services. And that is in the unlikely event of Wenger wanting the job.</p> <p> o You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>Those who doubt the wisdom of the Human Rights Act tend to see the rights and freedoms in the European Convention on Human Rights in terms of absolutes - leading on the one hand to a culture of rights without responsibilities, and on the other to a situation where rights are at risk of being removed by judges who are unelected and unaccountable. There is a balance to be struck if our human rights law is to win and retain public confidence. </p> <p>The court's task is to strike a fair balance between the interest of the community and the protection of the individual. I agree with those who say that the purpose of the Convention is to create a fair and decent society, not to let criminals off the hook, and that victims and witnesses have rights too. </p> <p>Some guidance as to where this will all lead us is available from north of the border. The system of devolution that was created for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland requires the devolved legislatures and executives to legislate and to act in a manner compatible with the Convention rights. In Scotland, since devolution in May 1999, lawyers have been active in raising issues about possible incompatibility. But statistics about the success rate of Scottish cases are an imperfect guide to what will happen north and south of the border now that the Human Rights Act has come into force. [The Human Rights Act covers all public authorities; the Scotland Act, under which cases have been brought north of the border since May 1999, covers only the devolved legislature and executive.] In Scotland the great majority of issues raised have been in criminal cases, not in the much wider field over which the Human Rights Act now extends and these issues have been directed almost entirely to the acts of the public prosecutor. So the development of the case law has been on a narrow front. </p> <p>The low success rate in Scotland (one assessment suggests that of more than 600 legal challenges in the past 12 months only 16 have been successful) is largely due to the fact that many challenges relate to elements of the right to a fair trial, such as delay, admissibility of evidence and the effect of prejudicial publicity. The Scottish judges have been following the European Court of Human Rights in deciding that the fairness of the trial must be determined in the light of the proceedings as a whole, and are discouraging attempts to have these issues determined before conclusion of the trial. But now that the way is open for challenges across the entire field of action by public authorities the success rate is much less predictable. My guess is that it is likely to increase. </p> <p>What is likely to happen next? Judges are urging lawyers to be restrained in the cases they bring, and are urging their colleagues to be robust in refusing to allow such challenges, as indeed they should be if they are plainly unmeritorious. On the other hand, the Lord Chancellor has said that the value of the Human Rights Act lies in the fact that people will be saved the trouble of taking their cases to the court in Strasbourg. It seems to me that there is an uneasy relationship between these two points of view. </p> <p>If people are to be saved the trouble of going to Strasbourg they will have to be able to obtain their remedy here. The fact that it is simpler and quicker to apply to the courts of this country is bound to lead in the short term, as it has in Scotland, to a great increase in the number of cases. But I do not see this as reason for treating such applications any more robustly than any other kind of application, or for asking lawyers to exercise greater restraint in bringing them than they would in other cases. The tradition in this country is that the courts are open to any person who feels his rights have been infringed. Lawyers owe a duty of care to their clients, and the House of Lords recently held that even in the courtroom they no longer have immunity against claims for negligence. So the judges are in no position to complain if counsel err on the side of caution in their own interest in making these applications. They must also appreciate that the courts, as public authorities, are themselves under a duty of compliance with the Convention rights. The UK will still be under an obligation in international law to bring its domestic law into line with the Convention as interpreted by that court, even if this conflicts with the view taken by our judges. So I would favour caution, in the initial stages at least, rather than robustness - lest, in a fit of enthusiasm for throwing cases out, the judges find themselves on the wrong end of a challenge under article six of the Convention, the right to a fair hearing. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract of a lecture by Lord Hope to the law reform group Justice.</p>",
  "<p>The defeat that hastened Kevin Keegan's departure as England coach was largely brought about through an English diamond being trumped by German hearts. Keegan employed a tactic of the 70s and saw it outpassed, outwitted and outrun by the football of the new millennium. </p> <p>It was England's worst performance in a qualifier since Graham Taylor's side lost 2-0 to Norway in Oslo in 1993 and was precipitated by a similarly flawed strategy. For just as Taylor had declared Gary Pallister, a centre-half, a full-back inorder to counter the threat of long high balls reaching the lofty Jostein Flo on the right, so Keegan played Gareth Southgate, a central defender, in midfield hoping to minimise the influence of Mehmet Scholl behind the German strikers. </p> <p>Taylor's plan backfired from the moment that Flo switched to the left wing and took Pallister with him. Keegan's ploy foundered because Rudi V\u00f6ller, the Germany coach, disobligingly played Oliver Bierhoff as a lone central striker with Scholl roaming far and wide. </p> <p>Southgate was once a workaday midfielder with Crystal Palace but became an established international as the spare man in defence. He soon lost track of Scholl and thereafter appeared confused as to what his role should be. </p> <p>As a result the diamond became a rhomboid with David Beckham drifting in from the right to search for the ball, Nick Barmby uncertain as to whether he should do likewise on the left, and Paul Scholes inundated by Germans when the opposition broke away. </p> <p>Things might have been better, during that apocalyptically bad first half for England, had the full-backs Gary Neville and Graeme le Saux provided the team with consistent width and supplied the quality of centres needed to disturb Germany's back three. </p> <p>Neville, however, simply froze at the idea of crossing the halfway line and Le Saux, though willing to move forward on the left, was increasingly hampered by a tight muscle. After half-time Neville gave way to the pacy Kieron Dyer and Southgate went back into defence. England had a better shape but by then the shape of the match was unalterable. </p> <p>Most of the time England's two strikers, Andrew Cole and Michael Owen, scarcely brought a wrinkle to the foreheads of Jens Nowotny and the other German defenders, so poor was the service from midfield and the wings. To the end Nowotny was able to stride upfield to help set up chances which might have increased England's humiliation, always assuming this was possible.</p> <p>The amount of freedom Germany were allowed in midfield was embarrassing. Dietmar Hamann is a competent footballer for Liverpool in the Premiership but the way England played he was allowed to become another G\u00fcnter Netzer. </p> <p>Likewise Carsten Ramelow and Michael Ballack had all the time and room they needed to bring the ball out of defence and swing lazily past what was often token opposition. On the right wing Marco Bode, tall, athletic and with good close control, reminded Wembley of just how far Neville has receded as an international defender, and on the left the 20-year-old Sebastian Deisler put into perspective all those optimistic noises about the quality of youngsters England are supposed to possess. </p> <p>Yes, Joe Cole, Gareth Barry and Titus Bramble might, just might, become decent international players, and others will have good careers in the Premiership. But compared with Argentina, say, the budding talent in England with genuine world-class potential would not fill a window box. </p> <p>England are caught in a three-way trap, with promising young players not yet ready, some of the thirtysomethings past their sell-by dates and too many of those in between simply not up to international standard.</p> <p>Nick Barmby, for example, was rightly talked up for a recall before Euro 2000 because he was in form and Keegan had no one else with left-wing inclinations. But on Saturday he was in a position to be compared with Deisler and in truth there was no comparison. </p> <p>Tony Adams was England's best player, especially when trying to stop the tide before half-time. But a successor should have come along before now. As for David Seaman, the goal he conceded after 14 minutes was, on the evidence of his erratic form for Arsenal over the past 18 months, an accident waiting to happen.</p> <p>Hamann's free-kick, taken from a central position at a range of more than 30 yards, brushed Scholes's boot but was still saveable. Seaman, however, was out of position and dived too late to do anything but get a hand to it.</p> <p>Maybe England had not wanted to offend German sensitivities by building a wall.

  "<p><strong> Kevin Keegan broke the news to Sky's Claire Tomlinson. This is an edited transcript </strong> </p> <p><strong>CT:</strong> Kevin, you've been in a meeting for a long time with some high-ranking FA officials. What can you tell us? </p> <p><strong> KK:</strong> I've first of all told the players that it's my last game. I'm very disappointed with the result, not for myself but for the players, for all my staff and for the FA. I've probably had a longer run than I could have expected. After Euro 2000 a lot of coaches who did a lot better than me fell by the wayside.</p> <p>I just don't feel I can find that little bit of extra that you need at this level to find a winning formula. I want to spend some time with my family. I feel I've given it my best shot. </p> <p>I don't want to outstay my welcome. I think the fans today made me realise they feel it's time for me to go. That's where the power should be. </p> <p>The FA have been great. I've had more support than any manager could have had. But I've not been quite good enough. </p> <p><strong> CT: </strong> Whose decision has it been? Has it come from you? </p> <p><strong> KK:</strong> 1,000%. Please don't think anyone has put a gun to my head. Far from it. I've always been a man who knows when the time's right. And I feel that's where I am now. </p> <p><strong> CT</strong> : The timing is interesting though, Kevin, four days before the next big qualifier. Have the FA tried to get you to stay for that game? </p> <p><strong> KK:</strong> Yes they did but I feel I would be doing it for the wrong reasons. I know it's not great timing, but there's never a good time. It's not what I wanted but I look forward now to a life outside of football, I think. </p> <p><strong> CT:</strong> Did you think this morning that if you lost you would offer your resignation? </p> <p><strong> KK:</strong> Yeah, it went through my mind. But I think I've had more than a fair chance. I've absolutely no complaints. I'm just not the man for this job. I'd only be cheating myself to carry on.</p>",
  "<p>After the months of speculation, denials, economies with the truth, bluffs and boasts, surely we are nearing the end of United News &amp; Media's grip on the Daily Express. No one can be fooled any longer. The for-sale sign is up at Ludgate House: the Daily and Sunday Express and the Daily Star are available. </p> <p>Companies that want to keep a business do not enter into serious talks with people wishing to buy it. They do not open their books for them. They do not, having received a bid, then suggest a sum that would satisfy them. </p> <p>Nor, if they really wish to grow the business, do they allow it to dangle in limbo, showing the minimum of interest in its problems and undermining staff morale. When the time comes to assess the Express stewardship of United's chief executive Clive Hollick, this tawdry end to his reign will overshadow his sincere attempts to make it work at the beginning. Indeed, if Hollick doesn't sell soon at a reasonable price to buyers willing to take on Fleet Street's biggest basket case, he may well merit the dubious title of the worst proprietor in modern press history (and that includes Robert Maxwell). </p> <p>Express Newspapers is the only media group that is going down in price with every passing year. Now the reason has become crystal clear. The papers don't make any money. Without revenue from the printing outfits, such as West Ferry, the company would be insolvent. </p> <p>Over the years, stretching back through Hollick's time into the regime of David Stevens, the once mighty Beaverbrook empire has been disembowelled. Assets have been ruthlessly stripped so that the paper once published from Fleet Street's finest building now finds itself a tenant in its Blackfriars editorial base. </p> <p>Absurdly, if cunningly, the papers' online manifestations have been detached to form a separate United division, Xilerate, which is not part of the sale. What the Barclay brothers are therefore trying to buy is just part of the entity that should form a newspaper group. No wonder their latest offer is so low. Does anyone seriously believe that the purchase price of a company with a turnover of \u00a3250m is going to reach \u00a3200m? </p> <p>So let's try to make some sense out of this mess. Frederick and David Barclay, through their Press Holdings group and its publisher, Andrew Neil, have been trying to buy Express Newspapers for about 18 months. Other possible buyers, such as Trinity-Mirror and Independent Newspapers, have turned their backs on the idea. Since the Express titles do not make a profit, the monopolies problem would probably vanish, but neither has shown any real interest. </p> <p>Mohamed Al Fayed has been mentioned as a potential bidder but there is a big question mark over whether he has the money, or the will, to match his supposed ambition. </p> <p>Though Hollick is known to be furious about the public revelation of the Barclays' bid, because it contradicts all the official denials that the papers are not for sale, the publicity might just flush out other hopeful buyers. For the moment, though, the only game in town is being played by the Barclays. They have bid at least \u00a375m, but it isn't their final offer: they will pay what the company is worth. By chance, they have a first-class idea about its current value. Obligingly for the Barclays and embarrassingly for Hollick, United's own broker, Merrill Lynch, has published a report suggesting it lies in the range of \u00a374m to \u00a3105m. </p> <p>If that is so, then United's board, if it wishes to satisfy the company's shareholders, should be entertaining the Barclays to lunch. The subsidised canteen has long gone, but the dining rooms on the top floor still turn out reasonable meals at \u00a325 a head. </p> <p>While United's directors ponder, Neil's team has asked United's merchant bank, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, to explain why they should pay more. \"It isn't a vanity purchase,\" says one of the Barclays' executives. \"We will pay what it is worth.\" </p> <p>Merrill Lynch, by the way, are not totally disinterested analysts. They own MAM, which is one of United's biggest shareholders. Doubtless United's forceful chairman, Sir Ronald Hampel, might be pointing that out to Hollick this week in a sharp reminder that investors are getting impatient. Hampel might also question the wisdom of Hollick having just authorised \u00a32m to be spent on the hiring of 27 new advertising staff for the Express group. Is that the wisest initiative at this moment? </p> <p>Meanwhile, the editorial side limps on with the minimum of resources. One of the eye-catching figures to emerge from the fray is the fact that the combined editorial budget for the three titles is \u00a353m. Of that, it's thought that \u00a341m is devoted to the Daily and Sunday Express. It sounds a reasonable sum to me, but compare it to the \u00a385m enjoyed by the Daily Mail alone and it looks hopelessly inadequate. </p> <p>I noted the Daily Express's recent front-page assault on the government over pensions was headlined \"Peanuts\" and wondered whether it was a subtle message from editor Rosie Boycott to Hollick about the failure to increase her editorial spend. She is known to be deeply unhappy about the turn of events last week. \"I'll be extremely sad if the paper goes to the Barclays,\" she said, \"because they'll be against all we've been trying to do here.\" Since she took control in April 1998, Boycott has transformed the Express's former Tory political agenda, first aligning it with Tony Blair's New Labour and then, of late, championing the cause of those who feel neglected by the government, such as pensioners and NHS patients. </p> <p>While Hollick, a lifelong Labour supporter, has undoubtedly been pleased with the paper's politics in general, he has not been a hands-on proprietor in terms of content. He certainly had nothing to do with the recent attacks on Blair's policies, even though he was upset at the decision by trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers to back the competition commission's veto on his company's giant TV merger with Carlton. </p> <p>Indeed, according to many Express journalists, it is Hollick's lack of attention to the paper that causes dismay. Why does he want it, they ask? Does he care? This is a reasonable point. If the papers aren't making money, there is no business reason for keeping them. If he doesn't use them to back his party, then there is no political reason for having them. There is pride, of course, but that generally comes before a fall. </p> <p>Anyway, if Hollick were to sell to the Barclays in the end, would it be such a bad move? I can understand Boycott's concern for her own future and that of her politically committed staff. Neil is unlikely to share her view that the paper could make a profit by appealing to a supposed niche audience of a left-leaning lower middle class somewhere between the Guardian and Mirror readerships. </p> <p>On the other hand, he cannot hope to go head to head with the Daily Mail on its traditional right-wing territory. Any such challenge would be met by the formidable resources of Associated Newspapers. </p> <p>Neil is certainly not going to reveal his hand at present. If you don't own the train set, it's a waste of time worrying over new signalling equipment. He may have an editor in mind, though I suspect he doesn't, and reports that his successful Sunday Business editor Jeff Randall is being lined up for the job are wide of the mark. </p> <p>Politics aside though, why the concern about Neil? Sure, he had an unhappy time failing to save the European from the dustbin of history, but who really thought it would ever work? He has come in for criticism over his editorial strategy and marketing of the Scotsman, but he didn't invent price-cutting and it appears to be working for him thus far. </p> <p> Sunday Business has proved a huge success, and - let it be noted - its sale has remained above 50,000 despite his having doubled its cover price. Neil's 11-year editorship of the Sunday Times was anything but a disaster. Many experienced journalists on the paper, including those who disparaged his politics, came to admire his journalistic drive, ideas and attention to detail. </p> <p>Express Newspapers have had two poor owners in succession. The titles are on their last legs, lying unloved and unwanted on a trolley in an underfunded hospital. If they are to have any hope of survival, they require a massive injection of resources and adrenaline. Dr Neil's cure might be painful and, in fairness, the patient might still die. But surely it's better to perish on the operating table than due to neglect?</p>",
  "A Labour thinktank will this week call for the voucher system for asylum seekers to be scrapped and a human rights commission to be set up in a report to be launched by the home secretary, Jack Straw. <p>The commission on the future of multi-ethnic Britain, which included Labour peer, Lord Bhikhu Parekh, and Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Greater London assembly, is to call upon the government to declare Britain a multi-cultural society. </p> <p>The commission, set up by the Runnymede Trust, says that Mr Straw's policies of dispersing asylum seekers and forcing them to live on below-the-breadline vouchers have created \"statelessness and racial and ethnic divisions\". It calls for them to be given cash support and for their rights to appeal against deportations to be restored. </p> <p>Mr Straw is unlikely to concede these changes but the Home Office yesterday insisted that other proposals are under official consideration. </p> <p>The Home Office minister, Mike O'Brien, said: \"Many of the recommendations cover areas where action is in hand. Where there are new suggestions we will look at these.\" </p> <p>Lord Parekh, the commission chairman, said one of the first steps should be a declaration that Britain is a multi-cultural society, as has happened in the US, Australia and Canada. \"It is a way of saying to ethnic minorities and the world that we not only tolerate but cherish our diversity.\" He said it would not just be a formal statement but would mean that annual ceremonies such as Remembrance Day would begin to reflect the contribution of Britain's diverse communities. </p> <p>The two-year study also calls for an independent investigation of complaints against the police, of all deaths in custody and for publicity campaigns to ensure the public know their rights if stopped and searched. </p> <p>A major proposal is to set up a human rights commission and an equalities commission, which would involve the merger of the commission for racial equality, the equal opportunities commission and the disability rights commission. A single equality act would update the 1976 legislation on race and sex discrimination. </p> <p>The report is also expected to recommend government-set targets for reducing the number of pupils from particular minority ethnic communities who are excluded from school. </p> <p>It urges that national working parties be set up to evaluate the race equality impact of Ofsted inspections at schools and local authorities. Schools should also be given guidance on how subjects could be given an international and multicultural dimension. </p> <p>\u0095 A trust set up by the late Labour MP Bernie Grant to promote racial justice and social development is to be launched at the Commons today.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1) Keegan: the verdict</strong></p> <p>Kevin Keegan = useless, tactically inept innocent who should never have been appointed England manager in the first place. That's what most of you, in your usual eloquent way, are arguing this morning.</p> <p>\"Kevin Keegan should have quit after the shambles of Euro 2000,\" reckons Karen Handley. \"His inability to build a team with good defensive qualities was exposed then as it was on Saturday.\" After calling England's players \"mediocre\" and \"gutless\" she then returns her fire to Keegan. \"Well done Kevin, you have destroyed our post-Olympic pride in a single afternoon.\" </p> <p>And we've had hundreds of emails echoing her views. \"It was painfully obvious to anyone after the Euro 2000 fiasco that Keegan should have been asked to step down,\" claims Campbell Watkins. \"He is a nice chap, a good cheerleader, but out of his depth at the international level.</p> <p>\"He was also unwilling to stand down the old guard. Adams and Seaman continued, and had Shearer not retired himself, he would have been playing as well. Mercifully, Ince was left on the bench. Keown was right -- tactical ineptitude.\"</p> <p>Not everyone saw it that way, however, with Mark Bassett launching a vigorous George Carman-like defence of Keegan. \"Most of the negative reaction is probably down to the footy hacks that had to sit down Saturday evening and write a new set of headlines,\" he claims. \"That Keegan had the self-awareness and the courage to admit his shortcomings himself is much to his credit. That he has done it four days before a game is neither here nor there.\"</p> <p>But for many of you the real culprit is the Football Association. Perhaps Dave Noonan sums up your views best. \"We appeared to be on the up after Euro 96, with a coach who knew his way around a tactical blackboard and players who would perform for him,\" he says. \"What did the FA in their own retarded fashion do to reward those efforts? They left him out to dry.\"</p> <p>\"Since then we have been left reeling; with a disabled-despising, brainless god-botherer with the man-management skills of a chair leg to a hapless gung-ho, tactically bereft kamikaze - who quits to save his own neck and leaves his country wanting.\" </p> <p><strong>2) So who should replace him?</strong></p> <p>Howard Wilkinson? Alex Ferguson? Aime Jacquet? Or Joe Kinnear? One advocate of the later is Elliot Cohen, who writes: \"The FA should look for a manager who has had success at a club with limited resources -- not necessarily one who has won championships. The England manager cannot buy in the best players like a Ferguson or Wenger can, but must make the best of his limited resources. Come in Martin O'Neill, or even better Joe Kinnear, England needs you.\"</p> <p>Unsurprisingly there's no groundswell of support for Joe Kinnear. Well not yet, anyway. Instead many of you support another cheeky cockney, Terry Venables. \"Venables should be brought back to the job and 99 per cent will be happy!\" is Paul French's view. But not everyone agrees with him. </p> <p>\"Doubtless a lot of people will argue for the return of Venables, but frankly I would suggest taking a look at Peter Taylor,\" says Simeon Orram. And he has support from Michael Baynes, who claims that: \"The FA should now make a clean sweep and sack Wilkinson and appoint as manager his bete noir, the hugely talented and tactically clever Peter Taylor.\"</p> <p>But Tony Traub doesn't believe the fortunes of the England team will be improved by bringing in a new man. \"Surely the blunt truth is that whoever comes in will end up with the same ordinary players and will be in for a hard time?\"</p> <p><strong>3) Where now for English football?</strong></p> <p>The Richard Williams article on the future of the English game stirred many of you into writing this morning. \"This is the first time I've actually read a wholehearted appraisal of the scope of the problems inherent in our national team, that doesn't merely concentrate on the mechanics of the players/management, but examines the influence of our moronic, xenophobic culture upon what is an all-round unpleasant scenario. Excellent article!\" says James Gardiner.</p> <p>However not everyone completely agrees with Richard's analysis. Matthew Fleming takes issue with the booing of the German national anthem. \"While I agree that whistling other countries' national anthems is not a good thing, I resent the fact that we roll this into the English football problem, since it happens during almost every international football match in the world,\" he says.</p> <p>\"To debate linked social history problems is barely Mr Williams's job, and definitely not mine. Please stop wheeling out the same irrelevant arguments every time England's football is shown to be too naive. This has nothing to do with supporters, nor stadia, and everything to do with the fact that players in Germany, France and Italy and Holland are from an early age funded better in better-organised clubs and leagues, and coached by qualified coaches.\"</p> <p>And Matthew Fleming is not the only one who believes poor infrastructure lies behind the dismal showing of the national team. \"The English game has, for too long, placed work rate and aggression above skill and vision with the result that domestic matches resemble contests between psychopathic headless chickens,\" says Mike Hewlett. \"The continentals have been laughing at this style of play for decades but the English have yet to recognise the joke. Hence, the Wembley fiasco was caused by the technically deficient being led by the tactically inept, with the result we all feared.</p> <p>\"The game must be restructured to place the emphasis back on basic techniques,\" he suggests. \"This will also require coaches to be qualified, not simply be popular ex-players. In the meantime, at least we will be spared the embarrassment of watching drunken English 'supporters' vandalising host cities after their team has been humiliated once again.\"</p> <p><strong>4) A Scotsman writes</strong></p> <p>Are English fans over-optimistic? That's what Peter Bond thinks. And before you ask, he's from Scotland. \"English football, the fans, the media, the commentators, and England MUST get a reality check,\" he writes. \"England have beaten only two world class teams in competitive matches since they won the World Cup in 1966 -- Holland in Euro 1996 and France in Spain 1982. Find me another world class team they have beaten in that period (i.e. a team capable at the time of winning the tournament) and I'll eat my words. </p> <p>\"That record in international football is not grounds for the unrealistic expectation and hype that surrounds the English game. All major European and South American nations have a better record in competitive international football than England,\" he adds, failing to mention exactly how many world-class teams Scotland have beaten in the same period.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Readers' wives online</strong><br>While checking to see which of its flagship magazines Northern &amp; Shell has registered the domain names of, Monkey was amused to find that a certain webmeister, the one and only Richard Evans, is the proud registrar of readerswives.com. Intrigued, Monkey checked out the website only to find it defaults to Object1, the digital agency where Richard works. For a brief second, Monkey thought Richard may have devoted an entire site to his missus, the delectable Tarnya Norse from Mediasurface. Phew, what a relief.</p> <p> <strong>What a bummer</strong><br>Does somebody at the BBC have it in for arsetastic Granada TV sitcom The Royle Family? We only ask because, following on from the BBC's Montreux Royle Family triumph - when the show's chances of bagging a Golden Rose were scuppered because some dosy BBC minion sent a tape of the wrong episode for the judges to watch - the comedy has been hit by another tape-sending cock-up. Queue much bemused scratching of heads in newspaper preview offices across medialand, as the BBC's awesomely efficient publicity machine sent out tapes of the fifth episode of the new run of The Royle Family, masquerading as the series opener. As Jim Royle would say, \"BBC publicity - my arse\". </p> <p><strong>Dot.conservatives</strong><br>The Monkey heartily applauds the Conservative Party's latest brave stand against the shocking political bias of that commie-pinko-shirtlifting collective that masquerades as the nation's public service broadcaster. Obviously wanting to do our bit to help expose the hordes of subversive degenerates hiding under beds at the BBC, we feel duty bound to draw Central Office's attention to seethru.co.uk, the so-like-a-real-website-its-incredible website for BBC2 dot.com drama Attachments. Said site contains a thinly veiled attack on the shadow home secretary's brave stand against that hardcore criminal element, cannabis smokers, under the headline \"Widdecombe you hilarious clown\". This is an outrageous misrepresentation of the facts and a clear example of political bias - La Widdecombe has never been funny in her life. </p> <p><br><strong>Barely believable</strong><br> Kevin Brown, founding partner of Soul and a successful and no doubt wealthy ad man, is simply unable to resist starring in his own ads. However, friends of his have this week admitted he's now taken things too far by stripping down to the short and curlies - something he appears to have plenty of - for the sake of the Daily Star's \"MegaStar\" campaign. The poster features a nude - and rather flushed - Mr Brown covering (just) his modesty with a board advertising the site. Mark Cranmer, chief executive at Starcom Motive and a dear friend of his, said: \"Kevin has a long history of exhibiting himself. He's done ads promoting gambling, alcohol and now blatant sex. I feel he should have asked for his legs to be retouched, though, because he seems to be suffering from the skinny legs/fat gut syndrome that comes to all men as they get older. I love Kevin, but he is mad.\" Even one of Kevin's co-founders is advising people to turn a blind eye to the stunt. \"I wouldn't look at it if I were you - you might find it offensive,\" he said. You're not wrong, Duncan.</p> <p><strong>Caught out on a techie point</strong><br> Programmers panning TV shows? Geeks up in arms about TV stars? What the heck is going on? Anyone would think the BBC had made a show about a dot.com start-up. TV audiences may be unimpressed by This Life 2, the one set in a new media start-up and called Attachments, but those whose lives BBC2 is trying to mimic are even more unimpressed. True, World Productions may have done some homework, but those finicky techies are taking umbrage at any slight faux pas - such as transferring files by throwing floppy disks across the office and talking about downloads and demos as a revenue model. Those that haven't vented their spleen already are invited to do so at Everyonehatesattachments.com. But be careful, these hardcore new media types don't take prisoners. </p> <p><strong>Invaluable sentiment</strong><br> Granada Media chairman Charles Allen began his first address to troops of his newly acquired United News &amp; Media by declaring how much his company values programme-makers. Not such a surprising sentiment, you'd imagine, coming from the boss of a company with a significant TV production arm - but the jaws of senior United TV execs hit the floor all the same. Apparently the only word they were used to hearing from former boss Clive Hollick in the same sentence as \"value\" is \"shareholder\".</p> <p><strong>When the caption fits...</strong><br>Sir Christopher Bland got a morning grilling from the delectable Sophie Raworth (isn't Jeremy looking fetching too with his matching purple tie?) on BBC breakfast news today. Pity about the caption though, which read: \"Fiona Mannion: mini owner\".</p> <p><strong>expectingcomplaints.com</strong><br>Monkey apologies for allowing a cad like Danny Kelly to blatantly pull the wool over readers' eyes in Monday's edition of the Media Guardian. Asked about his favourite websites, Kelly named expectingrain.com and woolyrockstars.com. Pernickety readers, i.e. those that go through absolutely everything with a fine-tooth comb, immediately pointed out that the latter website does not in fact exist. More importantly neither the .com or the .co.uk domain names for Woolyrockstars have been registered. Was Kelly making a mockery of us all or was he merely pointing out a new market niche? Kelly says neither: \"I'm very much afraid this thing does exist. The url, however, is woollyrockers.com. Check it out!!\" Duh! Monkey did and fell in love with the Bee Gees doll. Could Kelly have created a monster? </p> <p><strong>Minutes matter</strong><br>What's this? The BBC's famously impartial news reporting standards slipping over its own 10pm news bulletin announcement? The Monkey has got its paws on an internal email from BBC Online producer James Thornet that was sent round after the news broke to BBC online hacks out in the sticks. He draws his colleagues' attention to the fact that the switch to 10pm means the regional bulletin tacked on at the end of the proper, grown-up news will be extended to a massive six-and-a-half minutes. \"We must put this story at the top of online news stories asap,\" says the excitable Thornett. Is he worried viewers in the regions wouldn't notice the difference otherwise? </p> <p><strong>Only slimline warriors need apply</strong><br> Monkey has received an email from Rainbow network, home of Xena fans (see proud to portly, below), anxious to set the record straight. \"Firstly, the generosity of Channel 5 in offering Rainbow a box of T-shirts goes without saying - we were delighted to receive them, and we had loads of entrants to the competition in which they were the prize. On opening the eagerly awaited box of goodies, however, we could tell straight away that there was no way, with the best will in the world, anyone other than a small teenager or large Teddy bear was going to be able to get into them.<br> We closed the competition as images of irate readers struggling to get an arm in a size 6 garment sprang to mind. As Tamara, the Xena co-ordinator at Channel 5, said: 'Annoyingly our merchandise person fits these and didn't consider the more womanly figure, ie me.' We're with you, Tamara! <br>Some lucky winners did decide to hang on to their prizes, although we still have 35 or so here in the Rainbow office. Send us your address and we'll happily send you one.\" Monkey is unsure about being compared to a large teddy bear, but may well have to take up Rainbow's kind offer in the spirit of investigation. </p> <p><br> <br> <strong>Sticky gimmicks</strong><br> Monkey was amused to discover an overflowing pot of honey in the post today. The honey pot subsequently attacked all surrounding computers and made everything in the office sticky. Eugh. The penny finally dropped when Monkey found the attached (and at this point very sticky) note, saying that eBay was stickier than QXL. Point taken. But did it really have to destroy my workspace to tell me that? <br> <br> <strong>Clash of the dot.com giants</strong><br> Plunging dot.com stock prices are nothing new, but the long-term ramifications are starting to impact heavily on those big boys we call Amazon and eBay. Rumours have started to surface about a mooted merger between the two e-commerce giants, which have both been rocked by the recent downturn in dot.com fortunes. A tie-up would make sense, particularly for Amazon, which is struggling to convince investors of its long-term earnings. Perhaps it should take a leaf from eBay's gimmick book and start sending out plants and pots of bottled Amazon river water to prove to investors that Amazon can make things grow. Just a (naff) suggestion. <br> <br> <strong>Proud to portly</strong><br> Channel 5 kindly sent 50 of its finest Xena, Warrior Princess T-shirts to the gay and lesbian website Rainbownetwork.com for a competition giveaway, on account of the pigtailed one being terribly popular with the target audience. Channel 5 was staggered, then, when Rainbow very apologetically sent them all back. It seems the T-shirts are of the cropped belly button-baring variety and, after a bit of market research in the office, Rainbow discovered they were too petite for its users. Seems a shame to let them go to waste, so Monkey is happy to try to squeeze into one to show support. <br> <br> <strong>Bad taste sensation</strong><br> GMTV managing director Christopher Stoddart is so concerned about reports of tasteless office banter that he has issued an email to all staff reminding them of the company's equal opportunities policy. In a carefully worded memo, he also reminded staff of the company's grievance procedure and told them that they mustn't feel frightened of whistle-blowing on their bosses. \"From time to time we will be drawing your attention to important company policies which we all need to follow. Our equal opportunities policy is particularly important because its scope is both on-screen and off-screen,\" he wrote. \"Should any employee have a complaint under this policy [or for any other reason] he should feel free to raise the matter.\" He continued: \"If it concerns their line manager, then they may wish to consult personnel.\" Who on earth has prompted this and what on earth did he or she say?

  "<p>The new Peugeot 607 is a big lump of French luxury. Smooth, silent, unnecessarily long and stuffed to the roof with toys, it wants to be up there rubbing suited shoulders with the big boys - the top flight Audis and BMWs. It wants you to love it like a tax perk. </p> <p>In my favourite publicity photo of the car, the 607 is parked adjacent to an airfield and off in the background, beside a glamorously pointy black helicopter, the driver - in blue shirtsleeves, briefcase to hand - is offering a firm handshake of gratitude to the liveried pilot. That's the kind of person you are if you drive a 607: perpetually out on pricey business, in and out of the heliport, keys to the executive washroom on your fob. </p> <p>So you leave the pilot and walk crisply towards your mercilessly polished saloon, which has really ugly headlights, but never mind. You thumb the boot-opener on your remote control, at which point it unlocks with a satisfying \"punk\" and the lid rises silently and ever so slowly into the air. (The general idea of labour-saving technology is to get jobs done faster. But, as everyone knows, the really cool and properly satisfying thing is to see something happen automatically but slowly. This is as true of hidden film-screens, doorways into secret passages and CD-trays as it is of car boots.) </p> <p>Then you stow your case and close the lid - though it doesn't shut first time, unfortunately, because you have to learn to give it quite a good whack, which is also the case, you've noticed, with the doors when you get out. Memo to self: have a word with Dave in the Fleet Division about this? Anyway, you're inside now, in the leathery splendour of your ergonomically-precise seat. (The car has already remembered and run a check on your favoured settings. It recognised you from your remote control.) And you're ready to begin lightly poaching your executive backside with the under-seat heater. </p> <p>You've checked the on-board phone for messages and programmed the satellite navigator. Incidentally, if you don't mind seeing films on a five-inch screen, you can avail yourself of the socket in the glove compartment and watch videos or DVDs. How technology creeps on. Only National Express used to offer an on-board movie service. </p> <p>With the engine whispering under you, there's just time to catch your own eye in the glare-defeating rear-view mirror before signalling. Now you come to mention it, the indicator stalk feels a bit plastic-like and stiff. In fact, don't the instruments in general on this car feel - dare one say it? - a little junior manager? </p> <p>And finally, you're on the road and it feels good. Not fantastically powerful, like you, but good anyway. As a top-level executive in an enormous car, your need to get things done is almost as pressing as your need to get things done for you. Peugeot understand this. The 607 wants to relieve you of driving's most onerous chores. Switching on the lights, for instance. Headlights come on automatically when the car decides there isn't enough natural light about. The hazard lights will come on automatically when you brake sharply, leaving you free to concentrate on the slightly more urgent matter of doing the braking. (A smart idea, that. There have been a number of occasions I can recall during sudden traffic build-ups on motorways when, fumbling along the dashboard for the hazard button in order to let people behind know that I am slowing down pronto, I have almost forgotten to slow down pronto.) </p> <p>What's more, the windscreen wipers work automatically, as do the headlamp washers. The air conditioning automatically adjusts itself and so does the volume of the hi-fi, according to the noise of the engine. When you lock the car the wing mirrors automatically fold away. It can probably be set up to go off automatically and shop for a present for your PA. </p> <p>The car is even keen to take onto its broad and manly shoulders some of the burden of reversing. There's a radar at the back that sounds to let you know when you're risking your paintwork. In a moment of executive fat-headedness, I chose to ignore the radar's judgment during a basic reverse parking manoeuvre. This was not especially clever - though, in fairness to myself, I should point out that the radar had earned some scepticism from me by beeping urgently whenever I reversed off my drive. The slope of the drive, combined with the camber of the road, meant the sensors, which are strung along the bumper, were locking on to the surface of the road and informing me that there was tarmac in the way. </p> <p>Also, what would Michael Schumacher be likely to trust: potentially fallible technology or his fastidiously disciplined naked eye? During this later parking manoeuvre, which took place on level ground, the radar's beeping rapidly quickened to a continuous tone. I would not like to be forced to review video footage of my complacently smiling expression as, in the midst of this shrilling alarm, I turned to my mildly anxious passenger and said, \"Ridiculous device! I've got yards.\" Emerging from the car, I saw that I had parked with the bumper actually resting on top of the vehicle directly behind. Still, no damage. Well, not to the 607, anyway. </p> <p>As a top-level executive, you'll want to know about the deal. Unfortunately, the 607 won't be unveiled until the London Motor Show next Monday and the price, Peugeot tells me, remains a secret until then. If it comes in at under \u00a310,000, snap one up, would be my advice. Realistically, though, you're probably going to need at least three times as much as that.

  "Gerontophiles, and those who simply like a good ornery character, were delighted when Richard Farnsworth, who has died aged 80, became the oldest best actor Oscar nominee ever for his lead role in David Lynch's The Straight Story (1999). Farnsworth, a former stuntman, had waited over 60 years for just such a part: \"It feels a lot better because I'm getting up there in age and might not have a chance again.\" <p>The Straight Story told the true and picaresque tale of Alvin Straight, a septuagenarian widower who sets out from Iowa, driving a lawn mower, on a 380-mile trip to Wisconsin to see his estranged brother, who has suffered a stroke. The film extolled slowness and age, ideas which were almost seditious in a country which worships youth, speed and the automobile. </p> <p>Farnsworth, with his weathered face, scraggy beard, and his blue eyes alert if watery, perfectly portrayed the dignity, individuality and stubbornness of the man. He was Lynch's first choice for the role, but he was scheduled to have hip replacement surgery, and was using a cane when the casting call came. When he heard that the character used two canes, he delayed the surgery and took the part. He was diagnosed several years ago with cancer, which had left him partially paralysed, and he struggled with the pain while working on the film. </p> <p>\"He was very ill in that movie, but, phenomenally, he made it through. He didn't want the world to know he was sick,\" said Jewely Van Valin, who had shared his life for the last 11 years. She was in the next room of their New Mexico ranch when she heard the gun shot with which he killed himself. </p> <p>Farnsworth, a third-generation Californian, spent almost 30 years working as a movie stuntman. He left school at 15 during the Depression, and worked as a stable boy at a polo barn, where many actors played in their leisure time. In 1937, two men from MGM came looking for horses, and for someone who could ride them, for The Marx Brothers' movie, A Day At The Races. Farnsworth followed this with work as a Mongolian horseman in The Adventures Of Marco Polo (1938), and stunted for years for leading Western stars, including Joel McCrea, Gary Cooper and Henry Fonda. </p> <p>Farnsworth was also a good swordsman, which earned him the job of playing Kirk Douglas's double in Spartacus (1960), even though he remarked that, with his skinny legs, he looked more like \"a crane in a short skirt\". He then started to get bit parts, mainly in Westerns, as stage coach drivers or cowboys, but his real breakthrough came in Alan Pakula's Comes A Horseman (1978), in which he played Jane Fonda's old ranch hand Dodger, a part for which he was Oscar-nominated as best supporting actor. The character, representing the Old West, is thrown from his horse because of the sound of blasting for oil. He is brought back home, but climbs back on his horse, preferring to die outside under the stars. </p> <p>Farnsworth also played a Wyoming rancher in Tom Horn (1980) with Steve McQueen, but his first leading role was in The Grey Fox (1982), the story of Bill Miner, stagecoach robber, who emerges from 33 years in prison into the 20th century. According to Roger Ebert: \"Farnsworth is one of those unstudied, graceful, absolutely natural actors who has spent a lifetime acting exactly as he feels. I think he is incapable of a false or a dishonest moment. He makes Miner so proud, so vulnerable, such a noble rascal, that the whole movie becomes a little more complex.\" </p> <p>Farnsworth represented both the Old West and the Old Hollywood. Of The Straight Story, he said: \"There wasn't one four-letter word in this movie. I'll tell you I'm really disappointed in what people seem to want nowadays - action, sex, violence, four-letter words. I've turned down quite a bit of work because there's too many four-letter words.\" His more folksy roles (including TV series such as Bonanza and The Big Valley) didn't allow him to be much more than a loveable old coot, until Lynch made his offer. </p> <p>Farnsworth, whose wife of 38 years died in 1985, is survived by their daughter Missy, and son Diamond - who is also a top stuntman.</p> <p>\u0095 Richard Farnsworth, actor, born September 1 1920; died October 6 2000.</p>",

  "<p>It was when she got the call saying that AK47-toting paramilitary police had occupied her house that Gerry Jackson knew she was in real trouble. It was harsher than she'd expected, but she knew there was going to be some sort of reaction. Running Capital Radio in Zimbabwe isn't like playing the Pepsi Chart Show on Capital Radio in London. When President Mugabe doesn't like you, he doesn't turn to the Radio Authority. He reaches for his gun. </p> <p>Capital Radio in Zimbabwe is the first bid for broadcasting freedom in a country that has only had the state-controlled radio of ZBC since independence. To maintain ZBC's four-channel monopoly, it has been an imprisonable offence to own a transmitter, making 1960s-style pirate radio broadcasting a terrifying risk. The mainly white directors of Capital Radio, led by Jackson, have had a shell company since 1996 but it's been a station without a signal until a legal challenge in the Supreme Court proved unexpectedly successful on September 22. </p> <p>The challenge was based on a pioneering attack on Mugabe's legislation by black businessman Strive Masiywa. Five years ago, Masiywa argued that Mugabe's attempts to prevent him setting up a mobile phone company breached the freedom of expression clause in the Zimbabwean constitution. Econet got the go-ahead and, in a curious footnote, it was text messages relayed on Econet phones that rallied opposition attempts to block Mugabe's referendum on constitutional reform. </p> <p>Back in old media, however, Masiywa's challenge was used by Capital to argue that it had a right to broadcast. The Supreme Court agreed, a transmitter was rushed up from South Africa and test transmissions of music on 90FM began two weeks ago. </p> <p>The station's idents were uncannily similar to Capital Radio's familiar smiling sun logo and the 24-hour music mix was on the softer side of soft rock. By Sunday October 1, the first news and current affairs programmes went out and this, it would appear, prompted the government to act. </p> <p>\"In Zimbabwe, radio is the only medium that reaches rural areas,\" Jackson explains. \"It was the rural vote that stopped Mugabe getting thrown out at the last election. We wanted to set up a soft-rock music station, but we also wanted to provide independent news. Once we started reaching the rural communities, it became clear to the government that they couldn't keep transmitting lies to the electorate so they had to do something.\" </p> <p>Station staff maintain the news was light and certainly not anti-government. They also insist that the talk programming had stopped by Tuesday and the output had returned to the all-music test transmission. In spite of this, at 4pm on Wednesday October 4, the police occupied Jackson's house and surrounded the houses of all those involved in Capital Radio. Wielding AK47s, they set up road blocks and searched everyone entering and leaving the premises. </p> <p>Moving quickly, Capital Radio's directors got their lawyers into the High Court and had the police activities declared illegal. The station was helped by the high-profile father of one of its directors, Mike Auret Jnr. Auret Snr is an MP with Zimbabwe's opposition party MBC and a prominent lawyer. Despite this, the police broke into the hotel that housed Capital's offices and transmitter and confiscated all its equipment. Repeated High Court rulings that this was illegal had no effect, and the following day the station's staff were stunned when Mugabe announced that, using his presidential powers, he had changed the law to effectively ban Capital. Still in hiding, they've mounted yet another legal challenge which they hope will be heard today - but they aren't hopeful. </p> <p>\"When the government announced the presidential decree, the home affairs minister John Nkomo said that 'all this running to the courts will soon be a thing of the past,' which makes us extremely alarmed,\" Jackson says. \"Our broadcasts were so inoffensive. We mainly played old 1960s stuff like Buffalo Springfield and Zimbabwean artists. Now there's a 24-hour checkpoint outside my house and warrants have been issued for our lawyer's arrest for obstructing the course of justice.\" </p> <p>And so the situation remains locked in stalemate, recalling the days of Radio Caroline versus the BBC Light Service in the 1960s. Even the music is the same. The only real difference is that the government side is employing paramilitary police with AK47s, who appear to ignore any court ruling that interferes with their activities.</p>",
  "This time she really is going. France's employment and social affairs minister, Martine Aubry, famous daughter of a famous father (remember Jacques Delors?) and the star of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's Socialist-led cabinet, will pack her bags after next week's meeting of European jobs ministers. <p>Few would dispute her record: unemployment is down below 10% for the first time since 1991; her pet project, the 35-hour week, is in force in larger companies; a major job creation scheme for young people is in place; free healthcare for the poorest in French society is a reality; the welfare budget is on its way to being balanced. </p> <p>Ms Aubry, 50, has been the prime mover behind all the flagship social and employment legislation on which the Jospin government was elected. She leaves behind just one piece of particularly tricky unfinished business, the reform of France's unemployment insurance, Unedic, which is run jointly by employers and unions. </p> <p>Inexplicably to Anglo-Saxon minds, she is leaving government to concentrate on her campaign for next year's local elections in the newly flourishing northern city of Lille, where she has been assiduously building her power base under the wing of a former Socialist prime minister, Pierre Mauroy, who retires as mayor in 2001. </p> <p>Local politics continue to exercise a remarkable appeal in France. More than 90% of deputies in the present government hold local government posts and more than half are mayors. As the French are fond of saying, governments in Paris come and go, but provincial politics are for life. </p> <p>Running a large town in the provinces is considered just as prestigious - and as influential - a job as heading up a mere ministry, and until now has been no barrier to holding national office. </p> <p>Prime ministers such as Mr Mauroy, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and Raymond Barre have combined the top job with presiding over the town councils of Lille, Bordeaux and Lyons; Jacques Chirac was leader of his RPR party, prime minister and mayor of Paris all at the same time. </p> <p>On Mr Jospin's election, in 1997, he promised to put an end to this long-standing practice, known as the \"cumul des mandats\", demanding that the members of his cabinet devote themselves full-time to running their ministries. He has run up against something of a rebellion. </p> <p>Besides Ms Aubry, the environment minister, Dominique Voynet, has said she intends to stand as mayor in Dole and will resign if she wins. The European affairs minister, Pierre Moscovici, will be campaigning for the town hall in Montb\u00e9liard, eastern France, and the agriculture minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, in B\u00e9ziers in the south. </p> <p>The highly ambitious Ms Aubry will not be leaving the national stage for good. She will certainly be appointed to the Socialist party's national secretariat later this year and providing the polls remain favourable - she has consistently been one of the country's five most popular politicians - she could well use Lille town hall as a springboard for a run at the premiership in 2002, and possibly even at the presidency thereafter. </p> <p>For the Socialist candidate for prime minister, at least, she will in all probability have a female rival in the shape of the present justice minister, Elisabeth Guigou. Every bit as determined, ambitious and competent as Ms Aubry, Ms Guigou is another rising star of the French left - and the minister hotly tipped to take up the labour portfolio following Ms Aubry's departure next week. </p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, however, it could be local politics that upsets that plan. Ms Guigou has announced her intention of standing for the town hall in the Provencal town of Avignon. If she wins, Mr Jospin will have to choose between sticking to his principles, or allowing the provinces to deprive him of another of his most effective ministers. </p> <p>In a presidential indicator poll published last week, Ms Guigou for the first time clocked a higher popularity rating than her northern rival - 41% against 39%. </p> <p>That will certainly encourage the frighteningly efficient justice minister in her undeclared aim of stepping into Mr Jospin's shoes when the prime minister has his tilt at the presidency in 2002. The only question is whether she will be launching that campaign from the employment ministry, Avignon town hall - or perhaps both.</p>",
  "Israel today is poised perilously between peace and a resumption of war with the Palestinians, with only hours to go before the deadline at which its prime minister, Ehud Barak, has threatened to declare the peace process dead and buried. <p> As stone-throwing youths descended yesterday on an Israeli army outpost in Gaza that has been a constant flashpoint of the past 11 days of violence, Mr Barak renewed his ultimatum to the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat: stop the violence by tonight or risk the full might of Israel's wrath.</p> <p> \"If we will not see the difference implemented actively on the ground, and a calming of the situation, we will draw the conclusion that Arafat has deliberately decided to abandon the peace process and prefers deadlock and confrontation,\" he said.</p> <p> Mr Barak's threat came on a day when Presidents Bill Clinton and Vladimir Putin made determined efforts to pull both sides back from the brink. For a few hours, there were signs that sense would prevail after Israeli and Palestinian security forces agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza - the fifth such truce since the violence began.</p> <p> Less than three months after Mr Barak and Mr Arafat came closer than any leaders before to achieving a lasting peace, seven years of negotiating effort were unravelling at dizzying speed. The national security adviser, Major General Uzi Dayan, went even further than Mr Barak, saying the army would consider bombing Mr Arafat's headquarters. </p> <p> Palestinian leaders showed no signs of flinching. Instead, they pointed to an overnight resolution of the UN security council condemning Israel's excessive use of force, and a casualty list of 83 dead and 2,000 wounded, almost all Palestinian. Hanan Ashrawi, a spokeswoman, said: \"Arafat cannot give orders to a people, to a whole nation that is being killed every day, that is being asked to lie back and die quietly and not defend themselves.\"</p> <p> Israel's commander in Gaza, Major General Yom Tov Samia, said the Palestinians had agreed to stop all violence, open roads, halt the release of jailed Hamas suicide bombers and clamp down on Palestinian television, which has been broadcasting footage of funerals and bloody clashes. But should the agreement collapse, he said: \"I will be free as a military commander to undertake any action.\"</p> <p> Yesterday, that freedom included razing two blocks of flats and a warehouse near the Netzarim junction, a constant flashpoint. In the West Bank, attack helicopters blasted hilltop positions near Hebron that had been used by Palestinian gunmen. Outside Ramallah, army commanders told Palestinians living near the isolated Jewish settlement of Psagot to leave their homes. In Nazareth, northern Israel, an Israeli Arab was killed yesterday in clashes with Jewish settlers who attacked houses there, the mayor said.</p> <p> But despite efforts behind the scenes to contain passions that flared first with the provocative visit of a rightwing Israeli leader to the holiest Muslim site in Jerusalem, the Haram al-Sharif, events may be spiralling beyond the control of Mr Arafat and Mr Barak.</p> <p> Although yesterday was spared the bloody gunbattles of earlier days, the killing is atomising, with Israeli civilians stoning Palestinians in isolated attacks, and individual Palestinian cities charting an independent court of violent action.</p> <p> On the eve of the Jewish day of atonement, and 27 years to the day after their last war for survival, many Israelis were overwhelmed by a sense of siege, contemplating the resumption of all-out conflict with the Palestinians, and possibly Lebanon, following Saturday's kidnapping of three soldiers on the border.</p> <p> They also faced humiliation, with television pictures showing Palestinians taking pickaxes and setting fire to Joseph's Tomb, a Jewish pilgrimage site in Nablus. The mob descended within minutes of a decision by the Israeli army to transfer control of the site to Palestinian forces, and its destruction is seen as a symbol of betrayal, and the inability of Mr Arafat to impose order. \"Within a few hours we have seen exactly how responsible the Palestinian Authority was in maintaining this holy site,\" said Yitzhak Herzog, the cabinet secretary.</p> <p> Once the master of all in the Palestinian-ruled areas, Mr Arafat's grip is weakening, Israeli intelligence officials said yesterday. They argued that a younger generation of street-smart fighters, the tanzim, was challenging his authority.</p> <p> An intelligence official said: \"Arafat may not be able to stop the rioters now. Even if he wants to do it, he has a great problem with the people - not with the officials of the Palestinian Authority, but with the mob. He is afraid of using power against the people because the people of the tanzim have great momentum.\"</p> <p> There were further signs that Mr Arafat's authority was splintering, as leaders of his Fatah organisation in the West Bank city of Ramallah handed out leaflets modelled on the intifada of the late 1980s. The pamphlets, printed without Mr Arafat's knowledge, called for a popular war, daily strikes starting at 1pm, and for night raids against Jewish settlements and army camps in the West Bank.</p> <p> Positions were hardening on the Israeli side of the divide as well. The government announced it would seal off the West Bank and Gaza indefinitely, preventing tens of thousands of people from going to jobs in Israel that are the lifeline of Palestinians.</p> <p> Tonight, Mr Barak is expected to begin pursuing options for a national unity coalition, bringing the rightwing Likud party into his government.</p>",
  "Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary, was yesterday forced to backtrack on her pledge of zero tolerance against cannabis users after seven shadow cabinet members mocked the policy by admitting they had used the drug in their youth. <p>In an extraordinary day of criticism from some of her most senior Tory colleagues, Miss Widdecombe admitted she had erred in presenting her much maligned pledge to have no truck with drug users. </p> <p>As what appears to be a battle between social liberals and authoritarians at the top of the Conservative party was being waged, the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added his fuel to the fire by becoming the first party leader to call for the decriminalisation of cannabis possession. </p> <p>Miss Widdecombe's hand appeared forced as Sunday newspaper headlines revealed top Tories - including the shadow foreign secretary Francis Maude - had admitted smoking dope. She then experienced a very public revolt within her party to her ideas. </p> <p>Peter Ainsworth, the shadow culture secretary, said her policy was \"unrealistic\" and suggested it was unhelpful that she had launched it without discussing it with the shadow cabinet. The former prime minister John Major also called for a rethink, while the Conservative vice-chairman Steve Norris said it was a tall order to expect the police to impose zero tolerance against a backdrop of falling police numbers. He also accepted that most young voters would disagree with Miss Widdecombe. </p> <p>Yesterday Miss Widdecombe said she intended to give the police only the option of imposing \u00a3100 fixed penalty fines for drugs possession. Such fines would not constitute a full criminal record accessible to police. She stressed she would pilot her ideas of cracking down on small or medium drug sellers in one city before attempting anything nationwide. </p> <p>Under her proposed regime designed to deter cannabis users, she said: \"The police could take you to court, as they can now, or they could fine you, as they cannot now, or they could let you off with a warning that is not an actual formal caution.\" </p> <p>She admitted: \"The use of the phrase zero tolerance in this area was unfortunate because everybody has their own interpretation of what zero tolerance is. </p> <p>\"I should have made it clear zero tolerance does not mean you come down on every single instance of possession. It means you challenge every instance, but the police have got to have the right to decide whether they do go forward. I was trying to ensure that where they did want to go forward, they have more teeth than now\". </p> <p>She wanted to replace the caution for drugs possession with the fine because the caution represents no real deterrent and few police wanted to pursue possession through cumbersome court procedure. </p> <p>She said \"It is a coherent policy that has come under such enormous pressure because the media interpreted it as the police invading private living quarters, raiding student premises and taking every joint.\" </p> <p>She said one of her most severe critics - the Police Superintendents Association - had \"got completely the wrong end of the stick. \"They thought they would have to do it on present resources, and secondly they thought it would remove all discretion\". </p> <p>She also stressed that a fixed penalty fine would not represent a more serious criminal record than a police caution. It would not be a record for use by employers. </p> <p>She admitted the Conservative central office briefing paper accompanying her speech stating the fixed penalty fine would constitute a criminal record was technically correct, but \"it would have been more accurate if it added that the record would not show in most checks in exactly the same way as a police caution. I am not introducing something that does not happen at the moment\". </p> <p>Charles Kennedy, speaking on ITV's Jonathan Dimbleby programme, accused her of political hysterics, adding \"she has performed a public service in the past few days by showing how far public attitudes have changed\". </p> <p>He did not regard the shadow cabinet members or other recreational users of cannabis as criminals. Asked if this meant he believed the drug should be decriminalised, he answered: \"Yes.\" </p> <p>But the Liberal Democrat manifesto would not pledge to end the outlaw status of cannabis. Instead, it will propose a royal commission to look into drugs law reforms.</p>",
  "What do we know? That rich folks in Midland, Texas, have to look after each other, because that's the way it is in big Bush country. That - dang my dingbat hide! - Al Gore loves huntin' and fishin' alongside Tommy Lee Jones. And that young Willie Hague grew up with just plain folks in the Rother valley \"who are the mainstream of this country\". We know, in short, that politicians are singing a curiously similar song this season. <p>\"Come and meet the people I grew up with,\" said a lyrical Willie. \"Children of proud mothers who struggled on small budgets, who relied on the local health service and who hoped for a better life for their sons and daughters. Children of fathers who worked hard in the mines and on farms and in steelworks and who never knew the security of owning a home or saving for a pension, who had no choice but to live from one week's pay packet to the next ... These are the people who motivate me.\" </p> <p>Now, I don't mean to impugn Mr Hague's sincerity - or, indeed, his inspiring memory of a time before some nameless lady closed those mines and shut those steelworks. The point is style, not substance. The point is that, for a fiercely independent nation run by similarly fired politicians, we seem pathetically eager to nick whatever American convention rhetoric happens to be going. </p> <p>That \"proud mum\" passage is pure Gore (and only lightly filtered Bush). It doesn't now fall from Hague's lips by accident (any more than it was a Brighton accident to hear Gordon Brown banging on about \"hardworking families\" or Tony Blair \"fighting\" an apparently eternal fight). They're all at it, all copycatting, all nicking away. </p> <p>Thus one Tory spinmeister could be found in Bournemouth last week explaining that the new, inclusive stuff about \"the poor and the dispossessed\" didn't mean they expected the financially afflicted to vote for them - just that it would make middle-classes defectors feel less guilty about returning to the tax-lopping fold. Great unholy rip-offs! Didn't I hear a Republican spinmeister say exactly the same in Philadelphia? Reader, I did. </p> <p>Whether we like it or not, whether we even realise it or not, our election and theirs are rattling along the same barren track, invoking the same arid \"visions\", mouthing the same desiccated words. Which means that one of the most fascinating questions about both contests is increasingly relevant, too. </p> <p>Call it the question that Kevin Keegan kept ask himself rather too often and rather too prematurely. Call it the question Slobodan Milosevic declines to put. Not who's won, but what happens to the losers? </p> <p>Let's be cavalier about the two camps of our present rulers. There's no great need to linger too long over the prospective defeat of New Labour, or of Bill Clinton's slightly less new Democrats. One would be an earthquake consigning Blair and Brown to an early political grave; but the scope for shift available to, say, Blunkettism isn't so great. No Labour replacement is going to bring the Bank of England back under political control or challenge the will of the global markets. Equally, no Democratic contender in thrall to focus groups will abandon the middle ground. </p> <p>The vanquished of the centre left, next time round, would still stand much where they stand today in all but slogans. They might be desperately disappointed; they would not yet be utterly desperate. Neither Hague nor Bush, however, has that cushion. They are pretty desperate already - and Republican desperation deserves scrutiny, because it is also the Conservative future. </p> <p>How, on this side of the Atlantic, does George W strike you? As a born-again bigot, an international ignoramus, a grinder of the poor and executor of the innocent, as a commander-in-chief only Dr Strangelove could love? Alas, this is the cartoon Bush peddled deliberately to his own party, the Bush who unites by embracing the headlines of the right and the small print of mushy moderation. In victory, he would not seem so very terrifying: more ineffectual, like his dad. Colin Powell would do the business, George would do the smirks. </p> <p>But if Bush loses, if the polls that once looked so sunny for him keep raining on his parade, then the knives are out. The Republicans will do what they threatened to do before the party fixers produced a candidate and a strategy they believed could win: they will tear themselves apart. </p> <p>Republicans - even today, before the knife turns - are barely civil about each other. The moderates, who have to reach beyond narrow ideological constituencies to get elected, hate the senators, congressmen and governors (mostly in small states) who don't. The Californian liberals hate the southern rednecks. The agnostic card-carriers hate the Christian Coalition: and vice-versa. Only the prospect of power keeps this increasingly dissident lot together, clustered inside a very big tent. But if that power - the natural hegemony they began to take for granted in the 80s - is once more denied, then carnage inevitably follows. </p> <p>John McCain's gallant rebellion wasn't a fluke: it was the harbinger of splits to come, a necessary showdown between those who seek to speak for and to an entire nation, to include everyone, and those who run a more exclusive, more moneyed, more self-serving club. </p> <p>Welcome to Bournemouth. Michael Portillo made the McCain speech; Ann Widdecombe did the Newt Gingrich memorial rant; and Hague played George W. Even his ritual attack on New Labour - on \"the waste and the lies and the cronies and the sycophants\" - was a Bush hand-me-down, what George says about Clinton every time his campaign train stops at a level crossing. It wasn't important any longer to see Tory division in terms of Europe. That, for the moment, is banished to the fringes. The inclusion debate - the debate that obsesses Republicans - had taken over. </p> <p>The \"ladder of opportunity\" to the underclass was being lowered and no child who could scramble up it would be left behind. \"Hard-working, hard-pressed\" climbers of that ladder could join the Conservative Club. The deserving poor would be suitably cared for. And what of those who remained? The indolent, the damaged, the drop-outs and council-house cannabis puffers, the second-rate citizenry (as Tory defined) who won't go away? </p> <p>This isn't the \"One Nation\" pitch of Macmillan or Macleod. This is the choice on which America is poised to pass final judgment, the inhalers against the exhalers. (Yip: even shambles and evasions over pot follow the mazy trans-Atlantic plot.) </p> <p>Losing matters. Hague expects to lose, but not badly enough for the chop. His would-be successors are jockeying already, edging to right and to left, planning for 2006, lighting the joints. Place your bets - but if George W goes down, don't waste money on Hague. Here's another smoke-filled centre that won't hold. </p> <p>\u0095 peter.preston@theguardian.com</p>",
  "Everyone has been having fun with \"fuzzy mathematics\". GW Bush, in the big presidential debate, used these words to deflect attention from the impression that he knew less about the statistical base of his policies than Al Gore. But there were two more important words in the Bush responses that were anything but fuzzy and rather more menacing. They were two names: Thomas and Scalia. <p>Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas are two justices of the supreme court and GW Bush named them as the kind of justices he would appoint if he became president. The unfuzzy actuarial tables suggest that the next president will have to appoint at least one new justice and if GW wins that means a generation of social reform is at risk. Scalia and Thomas are ideological antifederalists determined to push back the authority of the national government. </p> <p>It is easy to forget that the US is a federal state. The central government can take action at a national level only on certain criteria defined by the constitution. All other powers are reserved to the states, and people and businesses in the states are constantly appealing to the supreme court to declare unconstitutional some penalty or protection based on a federal, not state, law. </p> <p>One new justice who thinks like Scalia or Thomas will tilt the balance of the court. The risk that abortion rights secured by Roe v Wade will be nullified gets all the attention, but what is at stake is a veto of a wide range of federal laws and previous supreme court rulings affecting a panoply of rights and protections - and future laws passed by the elected congress. </p> <p>Thomas and Scalia have constructed anti-federalist majorities, based on narrow interpretations of the constitution, with the help of Chief Justice William H Rehnquist, and Justices Anthony Kennedy and Sandra O'Connor. These three are not guaranteed to be antifederalist but they have often given Scalia/ Thomas 5-4 majorities against Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, David Souter and John Paul Stevens. </p> <p>Christy Brzonkala knows the importance of that one-vote majority. A student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, she claimed to have been raped by two of its football team. Virginia Tech did nothing, so she filed suit in a federal district court against the Tech and the footballers for violation of her civil rights, relying on a federal law, the Violence Against Women Act. It was a bipartisan act, based on four years of factfinding which convinced Congress that gender-motivated violence warranted federal intervention. </p> <p>Several courts had made awards under the act, but the nine members of the supreme court ruled by five votes to four that the federal government had no power to protect Christy. It was a backward step for women and for civil rights generally. What was extraordinary was that a majority of states were firmly on the side of the federal law. Attorneys-general from 38 states testified to the human suffering and billion-dollar public costs of state enforcement policies and practices that treat violence against women less seriously than comparable violence against men. </p> <p>Repudiating 60 years' precedent, the court ruled that the federal government is constitutionally forbidden to criminalise possessing a gun in a school zone, cannot regulate tobacco marketing, cannot require states to regulate the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, cannot insist on the states respecting federal laws involving overtime wages, patent infringement and false advertising. A new term promises similar fates for a range of initiatives - and there will be constitutional challenges to the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. </p> <p>The Thomas/Scalia thesis, which appeals to GW Bush and the Republican right, is that they are not being reactionary, merely faithful to the founding fathers. That is a historical fallacy. Cass Sunstein, the University of Chicago constitutional scholar, is to argue in the American Prospect magazine that the \"liberal\" four are conservatively in line with the framers of the constitution, and the fiery five are revolutionaries. The constitution was not born from fear of national authority, as Republicans maintain. On the contrary, it was created by the federalists out of fear that state power would stand in the way of a national economic marketplace, even of the birth of a nation. </p> <p>States will not take a lead in regulation or worker protection when they are in competition for business with other states. Many are notoriously pliable, doing the bidding of special interests. Governor GW's home state of Texas is the most polluted in the nation, but he is satisfied with a self-policing deal he did with the oil industry. You have only to breathe the air in Midland, Texas, to become a fervent federalist. The supreme court should hold a few sessions down there. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "\"Revenge\" runs the slogan painted on a wall in a pedestrian precinct of this steel town. As towns across Serbia come to terms with Slobodan Milosevic's defeat, new battle lines are being drawn. <p>How much will the men and women who ran this country's corrupt system have to pay for their crimes and abuse? And will the changes at the top produce democracy, or just a new generation of greedy cronies. </p> <p>On the south bank of the Danube, 40 miles east of Belgrade, Smederevo was a bastion of the old regime. From the manager of the steel plant to the police chief and the director of the football club, everyone in authority belonged to Mr Milosevic's Socialist party, or to the Yugoslav Left (JUL) party founded by his wife, Mirjana Markovic. Now the old regime's supporters are anxiously deciding whether to jump ship. </p> <p>\"The police chief began to turn last week,\" said Stanica Stanilovic, a journalist on the local radio station. \"We had demonstrations in the town centre every day after Milose vic tried to steal the election. When people were going to Belgrade last Thursday, we noticed two busloads of police with riot shields and steel helmets, about to set off. </p> <p>\"We invited the police chief to explain himself on the air and he said he was cancelling the order to send the reinforcements to Belgrade.\" </p> <p>The police chief also lost no time in releasing a trade union leader and the manager of the local bus company who had been arrested the previous evening for organising the convoy of protesters. </p> <p>Until the middle of last week, Radio Smederevo was under tight Socialist party control, and as recently as September the station's manager banned any mention of Vojislav Kostunica's 18-party opposition bloc, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS). </p> <p>The most powerful man in town is still Dusan Matkovic, a top Socialist official from Belgrade who was sent in a few years ago as the steel plant's manager. Now workers at the plant are talking about strik ing next week unless he goes. The plant employs 11,000 people and half the town's population depends on it. </p> <p>\"Matkovic decided who would be mayor,\" said Zoli Kele, the opposition's campaign manager in the recent elections. \"He picked the town's chief executive and appointed his brother-in-law to run the steel mill's trading office in Cyprus.\" </p> <p>Smederevo was one of the last places in Serbia to be affected by the wind of change. While the opposition won control of many towns in local elections in 1996, the town only voted the Socialists out of power last month, and Mr Matkovic's tight control was a key factor. \"All the senior engineers in the plant were made to sign letters of resignation this summer,\" Mr Kele said. \"Matkovic kept them in a drawer and warned he would bring them out if they campaigned for the opposition.\" </p> <p>With the change of power in the town and in Belgrade, people are flocking to join the opposition. The new president's party used to have 200 members in Smederevo; now it has run out of membership cards. \"We're going to build a state based on the rule of law and not on people's connections. We have to take politics out of public service jobs,\" Ms Stanilovic said. \"We don't want to be anyone's servant again - not even for the DOS.\" </p> <p>The crony system which applied in Smederevo was repeated throughout the country. JUL membership was the best ticket to riches. Within months of joining, some people became fabulously rich. Even people who became independently wealthy found there were some privileges money alone could not buy. Sinisa Mihajlovic, one of the leading football stars, took out a Socialist party card last year to get land to build a house in Belgrade's poshest suburb. </p> <p>Comparisons between Yugoslavia and the communist countries of eastern Europe, which had their revolutions in 1989, are misleading. Yugoslavia ceased to be a one-party system a decade ago. Mr Milo sevic lost power through the ballot box, and the main factor which kept him in power was not repression but popularity, based on a nationalist agenda. </p> <p>For the party elite, he provided rewards, protection and privileges, plus the chance for a few to get unusually rich. Indonesia's crony capitalism under Suharto is a more accurate parallel than the state socialism of Ceausescu. </p> <p>In Belgrade, the new president's supporters worry that Mr Milosevic still controls the police. They come under the Serbian government, led by the Socialist party, rather than the government of the Yugoslav federation. This gives him a chance for obstruction. </p> <p>In Smederevo, people are more relaxed. \"The police live among us. This is a town where everyone knows each other,\" Mr Kele said. Elections are due for the Serbian parliament and presidency next year. \"People are already preparing for the opposition to win them too.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago today, Britain joined the exchange rate mechanism. It was, according to the gushing hyperbole of those who had championed the cause of entry a great day, as momentous an occasion as when the abolition of the corn laws marked the triumph of free trade over protectionism. </p> <p>Britain's two-year sojourn inside the ERM was certainly momentous, although not in the way its supporters envisaged. The experience has left deep political scars, aggravating an innate suspicion of the way European institutions operate. Tony Blair knows this, which is why he sought last week to assuage fears that power was remorselessly sucked out of the hands of the public by calling for a second chamber to the European parliament made up of prominent national MPs. </p> <p>Mr Blair has the right idea, but he chose the wrong target. The real problem with the EU is not its toothless parliament but its over-mighty central bank. Without root and branch reform of the way the European central bank operates, it is hard to envisage the UK voting for the euro, even were the government foolish enough to propose that the ECB - as currently constituted - be allowed to set interest rates here. </p> <p>One of the anomalies about the debate here is that those most exercised by the UK's so-called \"feudal\" constitution fail to raise a complaint about the ECB which - with its mixture of elitism, arrogance and incompetence - is as remote as the court of Louis XVI was from the people of pre-revolutionary France. </p> <p>Let's start with some fundamentals. By their nature, all independent central banks are undemocratic, since the whole point is that politicians should not be allowed to play fast and loose with interest rates, even if that is what voters want. The argument in favour of independent central banks is that while Sir Eddie George, say, will not appear on a ballot paper in the next election, he and the other eight members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee make a better fist of running the economy than a chancellor with one eye on the opinion polls. There is, therefore, a trade-off between democracy and effectiveness which, after the economic horrors of the 1970s and 1980s, means that people are willing to accept less direct control over monetary policy in return for the abolition of boom and bust. In the end, so the theory goes, we might as well have Sir Eddie because he has more credibility than Gordon Brown - witness the decline in long-term interest rates since 1997. Provided the right procedures for transparency and accountability are put in place, losing the ability to turf out those setting interest rates is a small price to pay. </p> <p>Taken to its logical conclusion, this updated form of enlightened despotism could lead to all sorts of decisions being taken by experts. Allowing chancellors to cut taxes and raise spending ahead of elections could be seen as a reason for an independent fiscal policy committee, while an independent military policy committee made up of assorted brass hats would stop governments starting small wars in, let's say, the south Atlantic when polling day was looming. </p> <p>Whether the new system set up by Mr Brown will deliver better economic outcomes remains to be seen. But there is no doubt that - regardless of whether the Bank has political legitimacy - it does have credibility with the markets and with the public. The MPC's monthly meeting is seen as part of the rhythm of economic life, and enough checks and balances have been installed by the government to ensure that the Bank can not be hijacked by a group of inflation nutters. </p> <p><strong> Shrouded in secrecy</strong><br> </p> <p> Set against the ECB, the MPC is a beacon of transparency and accountability. We know little of what goes on inside Europe's central bank. Minutes of its meeting will gather dust for years before being made public, there are no voting records of the governing council, the definition of independence is so absolute that the Maastricht treaty forbids governments from even seeking to influence the decisions of the bank. This dearth of transparency and accountability means that the ECB would have to be hyper-efficient and super credible in order to make the democracy-effectiveness trade-off work. If voters and governments are to give up a lot of political leverage to Frankfurt they are right to expect compensation in the form of economic policies that really deliver in terms of jobs and growth, as well as the traditional Bundesbank staples of low inflation and a stable currency. </p> <p>So far, this has not happened. The euro's 25% decline in value against the dollar since its launch has led to higher import costs at a time when oil prices have been rising fast. As a result, infla tion has breached the ECB's 2% ceiling, prompting it to raise rates at a time when unemployment is still running at 9%. Wim Duisenberg expressed confidence last week that euroland had reached \"cruising altitude\", but recent data from Germany and France suggested it may be stalling. </p> <p>We are, of course, not allowed to know how the debate went inside the ECB last week. But the sense is that the bank is stuck in the tramlines of textbook economic thinking - that to be effective any intervention in the currency markets has to be followed by a tightening of monetary policy. </p> <p>But the message of the past 10 years is that the economic textbooks - or at least the ones that the ECB is using - are way out of date. Where foreign exchange markets used to be attracted to a currency by high interest rates, these days they tend to be more concerned about an economy's growth potential. Central banks no longer win credibility simply by showing how tough they are, and the ECB's obsession with price stability looks not just anachronistic but self-defeating when an increase in interest rates leads to a weaker euro, which in turn exacerbates price pressures. </p> <p>The ECB is thus offering the worst of both worlds - a lack of democracy and a lack of effectiveness. The impression it gives of being out of touch and not up to the job explains not just the outcome in the Danish referendum but the draining away of support in those countries denied a referendum. </p> <p>There are two ways in which the ECB could turn the situation around. It could rewrite its constitution so that its minutes and voting record were released - like the MPC's - after two weeks rather than 16 years. It could adopt a broader remit which - like the federal reserve's - incorporated growth and employment in addition to price stability. It could adopt a symmetrical inflation target rather than stick to a 2% ceiling, a commitment which institutionalises deflationary macroeconomic policies. The ECB governing council could allow itself to be grilled by the parliaments of all euroland members. But let's face it. The chances of this happening are negligible. </p> <p><strong> Opportunity knocks</strong><br> </p> <p> That leaves the alternative route, becoming a more effective central bank. Here the glint of an opportunity is opening up, because there is a risk that the signs of distress from some of the big names of corporate America presage a more rapid slowdown in the US than has been factored into the currency markets. If the US suffers a hard landing the dollar will come down and the euro will rally. The idea that the strong dollar is entirely the result of inward investment by European and Japanese companies seeking to buy in to the American productivity miracle is not supported by the evidence. Much of the dollar's strength is down to hot money, and hot money can leave as quickly as it arrives. </p> <p>But the end of the boom in the US would have profound effects on the rest of the world. Growth would slow everywhere, and it would be up to Europe to replace America as the engine of the global economy. That would mean being prepared to emulate Alan Greenspan in 1998, when he cut rates at a time of rapid expansion because the risks of a 1930s-style slump were seen as greater than those of 1980s-style inflation. But that means being innovative, being prepared to take a risk. Thus far there is not the slightest sign that Mr Duisenberg has any of these qualities. The reason could be that far from making institutions more effective, a lack of democracy could actually weaken them. Now there's a thought. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The White House yesterday scrambled to contain the violence in the Middle East and prevent it spiralling into Bill Clinton's worst foreign policy disaster. <p>With less than a month to the US elections, the president cancelled two fundraising trips to Ohio and Indiana and a visit to New York to support his wife, Hillary, in her senatorial race. Mr Clinton said yesterday that he had been \"up all night last night\" trying to deal with the crisis. </p> <p>Reports from Israel said he was trying to organise an emergency summit. \"We have to do everything we can not to be at the brink of war in the Middle East,\" the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, said in a television interview. </p> <p>Suggesting that the US no longer believed that the Pales tinian leader, Yasser Arafat, was in full command of events, she said: \"He needs to regain control over what is going on.\" </p> <p>The sense of urgency in Washington has been all the more intense because Mr Clinton has only three months left in office, after eight years of trying to forge a comprehensive Middle East peace deal. Negotiations appeared close to success at Camp David in July, but broke down over the future of Jerusalem and its holy sites. However, Mr Clinton has continued to sponsor contacts aimed at reviving the talks on a permanent Israeli-Palestinian settlement. </p> <p>The importance of his personal role was underlined by the speaker of the Israeli parliament, Avraham Burg, who told journalists: \"There's only one person, one honest broker. It's Bill Clinton. He should move in very fast.\" </p> <p>Throughout the crisis, Mr Clinton has maintained close contacts with Mr Arafat and Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, often staying up long after midnight to talk to both leaders after they woke, seven time zones away. His strategy has been two-pronged - to try to stop the spread of the conflict into Lebanon through pre-emptive diplomacy and to attempt to reverse the vicious circle of Palestinian riots and Israeli military action on the West Bank and Gaza. </p> <p>Events on the ground have been refracted and magnified by the impending elections. Pictures of the rioters' destruction of Joseph's tomb, a Jewish holy site in the Palestinian town of Nablus, sent a shockwave through the US Jewish community, a crucial bloc of voters who have been urging stronger condemnation of Mr Arafat for not stopping the unrest. </p> <p>However, US diplomats are aware that any demonstration of American one-sidedness could inflame anger in the Arab world and undermine Washington's effectiveness as a peacebroker. The dilemma came to a head with a UN security council resolution on Saturday condemning the Israelis for using excessive force, and the Israeli opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, for igniting the conflagration with his visit to Haram al-Sharif, Jerusalem's focal Islamic holy site, 10 days ago. </p> <p>The US threatened to veto the resolution as too one-sided and Mr Clinton spent much of the early hours on Saturday morning directly negotiating a diluted version which would allow the US to abstain. In the end a formulation was agreed which avoided naming Israel and Mr Sharon directly, although it was clear from the context that they were being condemned. </p> <p>The US envoy to the UN, Richard Holbrooke said the decision to abstain had been \"very difficult\" because the resolution did \"not reflect the fact that Israelis had been killed and wounded.\" Nevertheless, it is rare for the US not to side with Israel on security council votes, and the abstention could inflict electoral damage on the Democrats.</p>",
  "Clarissa Hallings-Pott doesn't sound much like a farmer. She doesn't have a West Country accent; she lives in East Sussex; she's the daughter of a Chilean diplomat. But before you dismiss such outrageous stereotyping, consider the results of a survey commissioned by the National Farmers' Union (NFU), released today, which show that the traditional perception of rural women persists. Asked what they believed was the public's image of women in agriculture and what kind of jobs they thought women did on the farm, 2,500 people came up with this: farmers' wives are plump, rosy-cheeked Ma Larkins, chiefly preoccupied with cooking and baking, whose key role in life is to look after the children. <p>In an effort to dispel these tired images, next Sunday has been declared World Rural Women's Day - an initiative the NFU is holding in conjunction with the National Federation of Women's Institutes and the Women's Food and Farming Union. A prayer will be said and regional representatives of the NFU will this week hold forums at which they hope to unite female agricultural workers to discuss business, training and innovation in an industry that has worn somewhat thin over the past few years. </p> <p>We are, of course, well-versed in the woes of the urban female: how can she track down a decent man, creche, dry-cleaner, never mind find the time to give birth, cook dinner, go to legs, bums 'n' tums? We've heard all about her struggle to gain respect in the workplace; we are weary of keeping up with the Bridget Joneses, the neurotic city girls with their running tallies of booze and boys, calories and Marlboro Lights. </p> <p>Yet the problems of rural women are not so very different. Finding a mate in the country can be even more difficult than in the city. Farming is a lonely business; as farmers sell up, die or retire with no one willing to take over the family business, properties that used to stretch over several fields become one long yawn of a farm. Denise Plumber, a dairy and arable farmer from Wiltshire, points out that farmers can literally go for days without seeing another two-legged soul. There are fewer labourers, thanks to cut-backs and improved technology, and extra hands rarely live on the farm, anyway, but are drafted in only for busy seasons. </p> <p>So acute is the problem that when Country Living magazine last year ran its first \"The Farmer Wants A Wife\" lonely hearts campaign, the response was staggering. Three of the couples are now engaged to be married. </p> <p>Karen, from Dorset, heard about the contest on GMTV. She trotted along to her local newsagent and, spying a picture of Trevor, wrote in. The couple plan to marry next year but Karen already lives on the farm, working alongside her fiance, pulling up wallflowers and driving the tractor. If she could have her way, she says, she would be married \"in jeans and a T-shirt and a pair of wellies\". </p> <p>But rural women are not concerned with romance alone. Lucinda Morgan is the newly appointed vice president of the NFU's South Weald branch. She is 33 but looks younger, fresh-faced, with hair almost long enough to sit on. Her first child is due in the new year. \"People keep asking when I'm lambing,\" she says, \"and I have to ask whether they mean me or the sheep.\" </p> <p>Her father was a banker, her mother a nurse, but Morgan always wanted to be a farmer. She took two A-levels, then an HND, and now has 600 ewes, though much of her time is spent on a dairy farm. Her husband, a marine engineer, is often away; they live in a mobile home on the farm and met at a young farmers' convention. </p> <p> There have been frequent treks to the nearby hospital for antenatal classes and various tests to ensure Morgan hasn't contracted any nasty diseases from the animals. She is not quite sure what will happen when the baby arrives - he or she will have to accompany her as she goes about the farm, sit in the back while she sees to milking the cows. </p> <p>Morgan is sitting in Hallings-Pott's kitchen. The ceiling is low and oak-beamed; two collies are asleep on an old ottoman. Pasta is cooking in a spicy root vegetable sauce; there's a handsome apple pie for pudding. </p> <p>Hallings-Pott, 52, is South Weald's regional president. She was once married to a barrister who fancied raising horses, but he \"got bored of that\", she says, and she chose to farm sheep. It was a crash course: \"I came to believe it is true what people say, that a sheep's main purpose in life is to die.\" When the couple divorced, she kept the farm; though remarried, she remains responsible for the sheep. </p> <p>Hallings-Pott and Morgan are discussing the problems of modern farming - having to sell meat below the cost of production, competing with imported produce. They say the government will never understand their troubles because half its ministers have never been to the country. They're all lawyers, mouldering in city offices where the windows are shut and the air is conditioned. </p> <p>The women talk of foot rot and how the sheep suffer something terrible from maggots at this time of year. They complain about local abattoirs that have been forced to close thanks to lack of government funding, about farm-workers' houses that have been bought up and spruced up by commuters who moan about the racket on a Sunday morning - a move Hallings-Pott says is akin to \"selling the family silver\", yet is often the only way to avoid another bank loan. </p> <p>The television and radio do them no favours. They cite a new Sunday night TV series on which a cow was shot because it had magnesium deficiency. \"Do they know how hard it is to shoot a cow with a gun?\" Morgan exclaims. The Archers, Hallings-Pott adds, is too politically correct. </p> <p>There is little to suggest that being female has in any way posed a problem for these women. \"I feel a bit intimidated at market sometimes,\" Morgan confesses. But then, she says, most farmers feel that way if they are not used to market. \"Women have always farmed,\" Hallings-Pott points out. \"When the men went off to war, the women got on with it.\" Traditionally, women have been responsible for poultry and dairy farming, because \"they've more patience\". </p> <p>That South Weald will now have an all-female hierarchy they believe is a good thing. Farmers have grown dispirited and discouraged; a fresh perspective and a touch of youthful enthusiasm could regenerate the industry. There needs to be more co-operation between farms and more social functions to boost morale, they say. In a community in which farms are traditionally handed from father to son, both agree their status as women farmers has never been questioned. \"People are just glad anyone wants to farm at all.\"</p>",
  "Media charges that Tony Blair was \"Napoleonic\" in style were always a bit rich. Ever tried contradicting a tabloid newspaper editor - or Conrad Black, the Daily Telegraph's Bonaparte-fancying proprietor? But the dirigiste nature of the Blair regime was established early on. His is not a collegial style. Cabinet meetings are brief and none too frequent. There were some 87 a year under Clement Attlee when Labour was in power in the 40s, 60 under Ted Heath in the 70s but only 40 under John Major in the 90s. Mr Blair, who calls even fewer, follows a trend in his preference for dealing with colleagues bilaterally rather than in conclave. <p>In a new dissection of Downing Street*, Peter Hennessy is on the look-out for \"worrying features of excessive prime ministerialism\" during the Blair years. It is not just because over-centralisation of decision-making could lead to abuse of power. Prime ministers who try to do too much burn themselves out. You need - the dictum is attributed to the great nearly man Roy Jenkins - at least four or five years to have a serious chance of shifting the British polity, yet such is the punishing nature of the job that exhaustion and negativism set in all too early. </p> <p>But the idea that the Blair years have seen irrevocable or harmful shifts in the way we are governed is quickly scotched - devolution aside. Professor Hennessy, who teaches at Queen Mary and Westfield College in London, recalls the near panic in 1974 when Tory prime minister Ted Heath clung to office despite having lost the election. Senior civil servants paced anxiously round St James's Park - where were the precedents, who was the arbiter of right conduct? </p> <p>There is not much of a template for the powers of a PM. No law sets rules or requirements (though Tony Benn did propose such a thing). The rough-and-ready code that governs the conduct of ministers applies to the PM, but there is no one to adjudicate it - except perhaps Whitehall's head prefect, the cabinet secretary. To his credit, the incumbent, Sir Richard Wilson, has avoided talk about the primordial principles of British constitutionalism. As far as the premiership goes, there are none. </p> <p>As Herbert Asquith, the Liberal prime minister, said - in between writing letters to his mistress during cabinet sessions - the job is pretty much what any given prime minister makes of it. Tony Blair's tenure comes from his personal dominance of his party and from his Commons majority. It is also hugely constrained by the power of his chancellor, Gordon Brown, a relationship for which there are few precedents (though Harold Macmillan's with Anthony Eden in the mid-50s might compare). None of Napoleon's generals got anywhere close to the \"bi-stellar\" relationship between No 10 and No 11. </p> <p>Pursuing the analogy, we have to note too that Bonaparte never gave Corsica away: devolution of power to Scotland and Wales makes the Blair administration \"unarguably different\" from its predecessors. The scale of recent constitutional innovations, human rights and all, has been camouflaged by the prime minister's aversion to talking about it in the round. </p> <p>All recent prime ministers have dignitaries to see and appointments to make. The chart shows the changing pattern of business from the 40s to the 60s, which is as far as we can go thanks to the 30-year rule for release of cabinet papers. We can surmise that Mr Blair spends time on presentation, meeting columnists and entertaining the editor of the Daily Mail - a singularly fruitless task by the look of it. Professor Hennessy observes dryly that his hero Clem Attlee \"would not only have found the media life of Mr Blair incredible, he would have recoiled from it absolutely\". </p> <p>Yet he finds Mr Blair in tune with his predecessors in one critical respect - how to wage war. Mr Blair is the first post-1945 premier to have presided over two conflicts in the space of six months if we exclude colonial emergencies. His mettle was tested and he proved remarkably collegial in the crises. The full cabinet was consulted over Kosovo prior to Nato's air strikes and kept regularly updated after that. One member quipped there was more collective discussion of the Balkans than the Budget. Then and during the Gulf emergencies, a version of the traditional war cabinet convened, attended by foreign secretary Robin Cook, defence secretary George Robertson, the attorney general and Alastair Campbell - and there are precedents for personal advisers as close-in as he has been. In the ultra-private business of government, for example consuming the products of the intelligence agencies, Mr Blair has broken no moulds. </p> <p>A perennial problem in the governance of the UK is determining how much power and influence the centre should have over departments, to keep them in line without stifling initiative. Despite civil service reforms, despite Mr Blair's personal ascendancy, it is far from obvious that the New Labour solution is any more satisfactory or long-lasting than those sought by Harold Wilson or Margaret Thatcher, two other tinkerers with the machinery of the central state. </p> <p>The window for structural change at the centre is now shutting. As the general election approaches and events take their toll, it is a fair bet that cabinet discussions will lengthen. Consensus will again be prized. Nothing of the usual way of doing prime ministerial business has been thrown away since May 1997.</p> <p>*Peter Hennessy's The Prime Minister: The Office and its Holders Since 1945 is published by Allen Lane.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.walker@theguardian.com\">david.walker@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The battle of spin being waged over the award of the next lottery licence plumbed new depths yesterday, after the backfire of Camelot's latest attempt to suggest the quango making the award was biased against it. </p> <p>Camelot claimed the national lottery commission's hiring of a City law firm, Freshfields, to advise it was a potential conflict of interest because the lawyers had worked for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin group. </p> <p>But yesterday it emerged that Freshfields had worked for Camelot far more recently than it had for Branson, and had also worked for Camelot's key supplier, G-Tech. </p> <p>Camelot has written to the lottery regulator demanding an explanation about the appointment. </p> <p>A Camelot spokesman said: \"We are concerned. If there is a potential conflict of interest, it does not create the climate where the process can recover a degree of fairness. </p> <p>\"This is yet another question mark. We have written to Freshfields and asked them to explain. </p> <p>\"Given that Freshfields have worked for Virgin, G-Tech and Camelot in the past, are they best placed to advise the commission?\" A spokesman for Branson said that not only had Freshfields not advised Virgin for a decade, but Virgin was not involved in the People's Lottery bid headed by Sir Richard. </p> <p>\"Camelot are really scraping the barrel on this one. Freshfields have also acted for shareholders in Camelot and have in the past acted for Camelot itself, so what is the issue?\" </p> <p>A national lottery commission spokesman said: \"It would be ludicrous to suggest that Freshfields are anything other than wholly neutral about the bids, and professional in their advice. </p> <p>\"As a top City firm, they have worked for many clients, including Guy Snowden, the former chairman of G-Tech, during his libel trial. That was against Richard Branson. </p> <p>\"Virgin, on the other hand, are not involved in the bid by the People's Lottery. There is absolutely no conflict of interest here.\" </p> <p>In August the commission ruled Camelot out of the running for the next licence, a decision that was overturned by the high court, which branded it as \"conspicuously unfair\". </p> <p>In the last week Camelot has been on the offensive in its attempt to retain the lottery licence, loss of which threatens the company's survival. Its efforts claimed the scalp of the commission's chair, Dame Helena Shovelton, who quit last week. </p> <p>But Camelot was also aided by stories appearing almost daily giving momentum to its claims of being wronged. </p> <p>One newspaper revealed that some commission members knew people involved with the Branson bid. </p> <p>Subsequently it was reported that Alan Howarth, under-secretary of state for culture, media and sport, was an adviser to Virgin airlines between 1992 and 1996. </p> <p>However, Camelot yesterday accepted that Mr Howarth had no role in the lottery. </p> <p>A Camelot spokesman said: \"We are relaxed about Alan Howarth's role. </p> <p>\"We have no reason to suppose that he has affected matters in any way.\"</p>",
  "Three anti-nuclear protesters who escaped a conviction for criminal damage by arguing that they were justified in trying to destroy illegal weapons of mass destruction will go back to court today in an important test case on whether international law can provide a defence in a UK criminal court. <p>Angela Zelter, Ellen Moxley and Ulla Roder boarded the floating laboratory Maytime, part of the Trident nuclear submarine programme, in June 1999 and threw equipment worth several hundred thousand pounds into Loch Goil. The lab researches, tests and maintains Trident's ability to remain undetected underwater. </p> <p>The three were charged with criminal damage and sent for trial at Greenock sheriff court in October 1999. They admitted causing damage but argued they had no criminal intent. </p> <p>Their defence was that they were acting to prevent a greater crime by disarming illegal weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>Sheriff Margaret Gimblett directed the jury to acquit them. She ruled that there was no criminal intent in their action because it was based on a belief that they were acting against a continuing criminal conspiracy to contravene international humanitarian law. </p> <p>Now the lord advocate, who heads Scotland's prosecution system, is challenging the surprise ruling in a five-day hearing which opens in the high court in Edinburgh today. He will use a device invoked in only around one case a year - the lord advocate's reference - to seek a decision that the sheriff's ruling was legally wrong. </p> <p>In all six cases in which the reference had been used so far, the high court judges ruled against the trial judge. The outcome of the case will not affect the women's acquittal, but will establish a legal precedent for trial judges in future cases. </p> <p>Ms Zelter is representing herself in the high court proceedings, while the other two will be represented by lawyers. </p> <p>In 1996 the international court of justice, asked for an advisory opinion on the legality of nuclear weapons by the World Health Organisation, concluded: \"The threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflicts, and in particular the principles and rules of international law.\" </p> <p>However, the opinion was limited to times of war. </p> <p>The high court judges will have to decide the answers to four questions. </p> <p>These are: whether evidence about international law can be given in a Scottish criminal prosecution; whether any rule of international law justifies damaging or destroying property because of an objection to nuclear weapons; whether defendants' belief that their actions were justified constitutes a defence; and whether the fact that an offence was committed to prevent a crime by another person is a general defence to a criminal charge. </p> <p>Even if the judges rule that such a defence cannot be used in future cases, there will be nothing to prevent juries acquitting if they sympathise with the defendants, even if they have no valid defence in law. </p> <p>The women belong to Trident Ploughshares, a UK-based campaign whose members from 14 countries pledge to \"prevent nuclear crime by engaging in peaceful acts of practical disarmament\". </p> <p>\u0095 Atomic energy chiefs are preparing to announce how they intend to decommission the Dounreay nuclear reprocessing plant, in the north of Scotland, which is due to close in 2004. The decommissioning of the site is estimated to cost \u00a34bn and is deemed likely to take as much as 60 years to complete. </p> <p>Environmental lobbyists were yesterday putting pressure on the UK atomic energy authority, which owns the reprocessing plant, not to start reprocessing fuel as part of the shutdown procedure.</p>",
  "This is a time for restraint, not for more, murderous mayhem. This is a time for leadership, not for submission to the blinding anger of the streets. Restraint and leadership were lacking in the immediate aftermath of Ariel Sharon's offensive visit to Haram al-Sharif. Palestinian civilians reacted with violent rage, the Israeli army with excessive force. Their political leaders, Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak, failing to take firm charge, opted instead to blame each other, the one rejecting a US-mediated ceasefire, the other ruling out an international inquiry into his government's actions. <p>Restraint and leadership are lacking now as Mr Barak threatens to wage war in the West Bank in defence of Jewish settlements and in Lebanon. The weekend clashes with Hizbullah, the renewed air raids and border bombardments, are an appalling backward step. Israel's Lebanon withdrawal last May, Mr Barak's only tangible achievement, is now in jeopardy. In turn, Mr Arafat, part ambivalent, part impotent in the face of his people's fury, undermines by his weakness the peace process to which he has pledged Palestine's future. </p> <p>Exploiting the moment, hostile outsiders like Iraq and Iran tilt at US regional \"hegemony\" and call for a \"holy war\". For their own ends, they urge the Palestinians to throw their bodies upon Israel's bayonets in a vicarious conflict they themselves are too smart to fight. Throughout the Arab world, in Israel itself, and among Israel's Arab citizens, the mood hardens. It is, after all, so much easier to vent hatred and prejudice, to throw stones and fire bullets, than to seek compromise and conciliation. But this is what happens when leadership fails and restraint is cast aside. </p> <p>Mr Barak claims that Israel's army has shown remarkable self-control in recent days. But his attempt to portray his country as victim will be rendered all the less credible should he take the offensive. He clearly wants to jolt the Palestinians into a cessation of violence. But his ultimatum, expiring tonight, is plainly self-defeating. Israel's prime minister should be in absolutely no doubt that a solemn declaration by him that the peace process is dead will sound the death knell of his own legitimacy. Mr Barak was elected last year on a peace platform. He has faced immense internal political difficulties. He was unlucky, in that the death of Syria's Hafez al-Assad paralysed negotiations with Damascus. To his credit, he went further than any Israeli leader before him in trying to cut a deal with Mr Arafat at Camp David last July. True to his word, he has fought for the \"peace of the brave\". But for him to abandon that struggle now would be to admit the bankruptcy of his whole policy. </p> <p>If the peace process really is allowed to collapse, Mr Arafat, too, may have good cause to consider his position. Enjoying an iconic status, he has been the face of the Palestinian struggle for so long that it is difficult to imagine him gone. But what, in the event of a descent into an even greater chaos and yet more futile bloodshed in the West Bank and beyond, will he have left to offer? Many may feel, if that point is reached, that it is time for the standard to change hands. </p> <p>For these reasons, as well as the intense interest of Bill Clinton in avoiding a Middle East implosion on the eve of the US election, the desperate attempts under way last night to head off an irreparable breach, possibly through an emergency summit tomorrow, may bear fruit. It is earnestly to be hoped that they do. If not, the events of the past 10 days will look like minor disturbances by comparison with what may swiftly follow.</p>",
  "<p> 'Of all the Earth's predators known and feared, none is more shrouded in mystery than the great white shark,\" said the narrator of <strong> Great White Down Under</strong> (Discovery Channel, Sun), in tones unilaterally reserved for Scary Subjects. At Narrator School, there must be a whole syllabus devoted to the tones for aspiring voiceover artistes when discussing spiders, forest fires, the possibility of robots taking over the world and \"the merciless killing machines of the deep\". (The deep, you'll notice, not \"the sea\" or \"the oceans\". At Narrator School, nuance is everything.) </p> <p>Discovery's Shark Weekend did the usual associated with documentaries on scary subjects, and was perversely jolly for it. It scared the bejeesus out of us with footage of sharks attacking cameramen in underwater cages, and photographs of attack victims with serrated semi-circular chunks taken out of their legs. It had technicolour coral paradises invaded by shoals of viciously grinning sharks who proceeded to wolf down unsuspecting stripy fish. It even showed biologists like Barry, Hamish and - my personal favourite - Dr Rocky Strong, using modern technology to track and learn more about \"these enigmatic beasts\". </p> <p>Yet in its aim to explain, what Discovery's shark extravaganza did more than anything else was affirm the notion that, despite scientists' efforts, we still know very little about the animal. And that ignorance was the most scary thing of all. Hence sharks got the most menace-ladened tones imaginable, more than pyromaniacal robot spiders. </p> <p>But at least you know where you are with a shark. With their inkwell eyes and slaughtersome teeth, they're quite obviously not to be messed with. Humans, on the other fin, don't carry such obvious manifestations of their dangerous qualities. </p> <p>\"I don't bite,\" grinned Mr Chambers, the avuncular children's home warden in <strong> Care </strong> (BBC2, Sun). No, he did much worse than that, as his unsuspecting charge, Davey, would find out. Along with countless others at the home where he was incarcerated, Davey was used and abused by men entrusted with his welfare. In its exploration of the aftermath of child abuse, as well as its perpetration, Care was a bleak, harrowing, unmissable piece of TV, exceptionally acted and wonderfully directed. A Cathy Come Home for the millennium. </p> <p>At its heart was a stunning performance from Steven Mackintosh as the grown-up Davey struggling to come to terms with his ordeal. Mackintosh moved from little boy lost, eyes almost sewn shut with tears, to raging bull, smashing and bashing those closest to him, a directionless, devastating fury fuelled by guilt, fear, self-doubt and self-loathing. </p> <p>With bewildered support from Maria Pride as Pauline and Jaye Griffiths as Elaine, a campaigning journalist, Mackintosh's Davey remained trapped in a world where there are no merry Christmases, no happy birthdays, no safe places or caring authorities. From his own private hell to humiliation in the law courts, all dark wood and intimidation, the all-too- terrible reality of what actually went on in children's homes all over the country was brought into sharp relief. Corrupt silence and paisley-patterned pyjamas hid - and are still hiding - bleeding arseholes and torn souls. </p> <p>And, in a sign of a most mature drama (and executive producers who know when not to interfere), Bird and Prendiville resisted a happy ending, simply because there isn't one. Of the country's 52 police forces, 42 are investigating allegations of systematic child abuse in children's homes. Evil is such an absolute word to use, but what's the alternative? </p> <p>Tense, perfectly paced and compelling, Care wasn't enjoyable in the slightest, but it was testament to the continuing power of television to raise issues and invigorate debate, to challenge good people to do something so that evil doesn't prevail. Our fears whisper it but, too often, we avert our eyes. Maybe Care will do something to change that. </p> <p>In the end though, Davey was all alone but for a bottle of cheap vodka and an overdose of paracetamol. All alone but for the thousands of other victims of child abuse who feel the same rage, guilt, fear and invisibility. </p> <p>Of all the Earth's predators known and feared, none is more shrouded in mystery than the great white shark? If only. In case you were wondering, the goddess of justice has left the Earth.</p>",
  "Show Janet Paraskeva a poisoned chalice and her response would probably be to swig it in one go, but only after checking quietly that the antidote she took earlier was the correct one. The woman charged with making the Law Society's reform programme happen is an instinctive seeker after alarming challenges; and galvanising the solicitors' venerable but troubled body is definitely one of those. <p>The complaints system is a mess, the staff are recovering from the bullying traumas of former vice-president Kamlesh Bahl, and relations with the Lord Chancellor, Derry Irvine, are delicate. A judge would still uphold the two-year-old verdict of Sir Dennis Stevenson, the management guru now heading the House of Lords' peer-picking committee, who was called in to review the Law Society's workings. He concluded that the committee-heavy body just didn't work. </p> <p>The profession will find itself looking down its nose at the Paraskeva part of the solution, because its new chief executive is small and quick. She is also systematic and very determined. The public's great grouse against snail-like complaints handling will be top priority. Lord Irvine meanwhile faces a nimble advocate for open, fair (\"And where are all the ethnic minority, women and solicitor QCs and judges, Derry?\") procedures in the mist-surrounded appointment system that has him and the society at odds. </p> <p>The fact that the solicitors badly wanted Paraskeva for the new, \u00a3120,000-a-year post, and have launched her with a tribute from president Michael Napier to new \"vision, determination and energy,\" is telling. At an early stage in the process, the Daily Mail will have been exhibit A, with its regular chipping at her support for cannabis legalisation and juxtapositions of gay and lesbian grants from the National Lottery Charities Board (NLCB, whose huge English operation she has directed from the start) and the fact that she is divorced and wears trouser suits. </p> <p>But the sound of tutting from solicitors' offices has been wonderfully inaudible, not just in London (where the Evening Standard savaged Ann Widdecombe's contrasting views on drug law last week) but also in the regions. It is this part of the 175-year-old Law Society's membership that may get to meet the new chief exec first. One of her main legacies at the NLCB is a rock-solid regional structure with the HQ in Leicester rather than London. </p> <p>Settling into her new Chancery Lane office, she looks forward to that but puts the need for an overall efficient system first. \"The most important lesson I bring from the Charities Board is that you need to handle paperwork quickly. That, and a lot of experience in managing people who object to decisions - to NLCB grants or to the way grant applications were evaluated.\" </p> <p>She and her colleagues - not especially radical: the NLCB chairman was an Hon and his deputy a Sir - were not going to satisfy everyone, when initial odds against getting a Lottery grant were 14-1 and there was no consensus on what constituted a \"good cause\". But they armed themselves with a huge preliminary consultation of 8,000 voluntary groups. \"Then we set up a clear set of processes and procedures, properly looked-at, properly constituted and fair to all.\" </p> <p>It didn't always look like that in early NLCB days, with computers emitting steam and staff working way beyond closing time, but there wasn't the bullying or rigid party line that often comes with system-freaks. Recovering from the legacy of Bahl, who had staff in tears (and may again next month, when she brings race and sex discrimination charges at an employment tribunal), the Law Society needs that less than most. </p> <p>Paraskeva can be ruthless, and some well-intentioned members of NLCB voluntary committees got the bullet for straying over very strict rules about links with grant applications; but every decision came with a transparent, A-Z explanation of why it had been taken. The words \"audit office\" were held over staff entrusted with hundreds of millions of public money, and all Dail Mail attempts to show that refugees or ex-cons or even pigs at an urban farm (with snout-operated showers) were unworthy, were satisfyingly stuffed. </p> <p>The NLCB was a new institution, however, and Paraskeva acknowledges the different challenge of an ancient body, where tensions over change have seen internal dramas, factions, and see-saws over strops with the Lord Chancellor. She will ease herself in: \"The consultation process over changes is already well under way. I will be putting my tuppenceworth in, but above all listening to people at every level and maybe especially at the coal face. You need to be constantly on the lookout for someone who comes up with that bright idea you didn't have.\" </p> <p>At 54, she wanted the job \"because I've got time for one more big challenge\". She also has the overt enthusiasm that only curmudgeons resent. She zoomed from a Greek-Cypriot, restaurant-owning family headed by a Greek-Cypriot father and Welsh mother, through work as a teacher and schools inspector to running the National Youth Agency, coupled with work as a JP, member of Leicester university council and trustee of the citizenship group Common Purpose. She is greatly proud of her two daughters, one a teacher and the other a potter. If there are curmudgeons in the Society, they may be softened by memos on postcards of ceramics by Paraskeva Junior.</p>",
  "\u0095 Last week I rued the fact that the appeal court's decision in the conjoined twins case would not be going up to the law lords for a final authoritative decision by the country's highest court. I've changed my mind, for a reason I'm not happy about. I'm now convinced (on very good evidence) that the law lords - there would probably have been seven of them - would not have reached a unanimous decision. Nothing would have been more unsatisfactory than a 4-3 or even a 5-2 split on such a sensitive and emotional issue, especially as each of their Lordships would probably have wanted to give his own - perhaps differing - reasons. Far from being clarified, the law might well have become more confused, and continuingly controversial. That's not a healthy reason for feeling relieved that the law lords won't be ruling. <p>\u0095 When This Life was on television a couple of years ago, the Law Society was bombarded with requests from young people wanting to become lawyers, just like the characters in the series. Their enthusiasm waned when they were told that sexual promiscuity and the ability to smoke 60 a day were not the only criteria for entering the profession. The further news that a certain modicum of legal knowledge would be required, and even the passing of a few exams, finally killed their interest. Now we have another series about young lawyers, which may re-awaken the attraction of the law as a cool career. North Square, set in Leeds, starts on Channel 4 on October 18. I've seen two episodes and enjoyed them, and I've got to admit that the barristers in this set of chambers are less adept at random sex and smoking than their London counterparts. But they do swear quite a lot, fight each other in and out of court, have babies and affairs, and suffer Machiavellian office politics. The barristers' chief clerk (played with gusto by Phil Davis) gets all the best lines and will make most viewers want to be him rather than any of the barristers. My usual warning: don't believe most of it. North Square is great fun, but meticulously accurate it ain't. Even in these enlightened times, a pupil (trainee) in her first week of work wouldn't suddenly be called on to take over a criminal trial for which her experienced head of chambers had been hired. Nor would our hero be allowed to play, at full blast and in the barristers robing room, his CD of My Father Was a Robber. </p> <p>\u0095 I 'm delighted to return to a topic which once played a large part in these columns: the fate of London's only gentlemen's pissoir (or vespasian , if you prefer, after the Roman Emperor who introduced them) to be a listed structure. It is green, late Victorian, and erected against the outer wall of Lincoln's Inn. I was reminded of the convenience when leafing through an entertaining new book, The Walking Guide to Lawyers' London, by Andrew Goodman (Blackstone Press). As it happens, the pissoir is missing from the book (which is probably its only omission, so comprehensive does it seem in every other aspect). It was once a much patronised facility by some of the great judges of the last century; I have personally made satisfying use of it next to a Master of the Rolls and (on a different occasion) a Lord Chief Justice. It was closed when building works were carried out in the vicinity, but didn't re-open for business when the works were done. I will now make it my life's work to find out what has happened and to campaign for its re-opening. Such a stream of legal history ought not to be allowed to be washed away. </p> <p>\u0095 In what city is the European Court of Human Rights? The question was asked last week on the veteran Radio Four programme Brain of Britain. I was genuinely shocked when none of the four competitors (all men) knew. The Hague, Luxembourg and Brussels were offered. The answer is Strasbourg. Even though that programme was recorded weeks ago, before the most recent flurry of publicity about the European Convention on Human Rights being incorporated here, it's not as if there had been silence before. In the past couple of years, the convention and the court in Strasbourg that interprets it have rarely been out of the news, at least in the broadsheet papers. Yet these four otherwise knowledgeable men had no idea. Perhaps informing people about our new human rights laws will be harder than I thought.</p>",
  "The American secretary of state, Dean Rusk, received a memo from a senior official on January 6, 1965, preparing for a crucial meeting that afternoon with President Johnson. The key passage informed Rusk (and, by implication, the president) that \"the introduction of limited US ground forces in the northern area of South Vietnam still has a great appeal for many of us, concurrently with the first air attacks into [North Vietnam] ... It would have a real stiffening effect in Saigon and a strong signal effect to Hanoi.\" <p>Five weeks later America launched Operation Rolling Thunder, its sustained aerial bombardment of North Vietnam. A month after that, 20,000 more US troops were landed, reinforced by others from Australia and South Korea. By the middle of the year, America's forces had reached 125,000 and President Johnson had to double the number of young men facing conscription. The nation was irrevocably committed to the disaster of the Vietnam war. </p> <p>The author of that decisive memorandum was William Bundy, who has died aged 83. He later acknowledged the policy he had recommended was \"a tragedy waiting to happen\". But he did not really recant, commenting a quarter of a century later that \"I was never able to convince myself that there was a cost-free alternative course\". </p> <p>In spite of his enormous influence within the Johnson administration, the president pretended to forget his name and called him \"that other Bundy\" - a wounding reminder of William's high- flying younger brother, McGeorge (who died four years ago). William was the state department's assistant secretary for East Asia, his brother the president's powerful national security adviser, a position he had also held under Kennedy. </p> <p>McGeorge's shadow fell across William from their early childhood. They came from a family of Boston brahmins, related to the vastly influential Cabots and Lowells. William went to Groton, Yale, and Harvard Law School and emerged as \"everyone's ideal of the New England gentleman, tall, handsome, fresh-faced, and courteous\" - a description offered by an English colleague at the Bletchley code-breaking centre, to which Bundy was seconded during the second world war. </p> <p>Less apparent but more important was Bundy's ability to be noticed by those who mattered. He enlisted in the army as a private in 1941, and arrived at Hut 6 in Bletchley 18 months later as a captain, ending his war service as a major. He briefly practised law until, with the outbreak of the Korean war, one of his Harvard tutors recruited him to the Central Intelligence Agency, where he soon took charge of the section responsible for America's national security estimates, the analysis on which US foreign policy depends. </p> <p>He also became a close friend of the CIA director, Alan Dulles, who marked him out as a possible successor. It proved a fortunate friendship in 1953, when Bundy became a target for Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-communist witchhunt. The threat was part of McCarthy's campaign against Bundy's father-in-law, Dean Acheson, who had just retired as Secretary of State. </p> <p>With the help of the newly-elected President Eisenhower, Dulles challenged McCarthy head-on to avert the threat to Bundy's future. Eventually McCarthy was frightened off, but the experience scarred Bundy and made him determined to leave as few footprints as possible in future. He became an archetypal bureaucrat. After 10 years at the CIA he was recruited to the Pentagon's International Security section, becoming chief of the department. He revelled in the job and was one of the Kennedy administration's leading movers and shakers. </p> <p>His brother was the president's national security adviser, and Bundy was a close associate of the influential defence secretary Robert McNamara. In 1964 President Johnson transferred Bundy to the State Department. Initially Bundy wavered about American policy towards Vietnam, at one point advocating reconvening the UN Geneva conference to renegotiate the 1954 settlement. </p> <p>But his background at the CIA and the Pentagon turned him toward the domino theory - that the loss of South Vietnam would bring Communist rule to all neighbouring countries. To thwart this, he became an enthusiastic proponent of covert action and resisted the idea of democratic elections. </p> <p>The arrival of Richard Nixon in the White House meant Bundy departed to teach international affairs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There he became a target for anti-war protesters, some of whom tried to blow up his office. In 1972 he withdrew to the haven of editing the influential magazine Foreign Affairs. And even there, as Henry Kissinger noted, \"his appointment was greeted with howls of protest\". Possibly as a response, the previously hawkish magazine began to publish attacks on America's role in Vietnam. </p> <p>Bundy's limited but important impact on America's domestic agenda was far more benign. His recommendations to the 1960 Commission on National Goals influenced the preparation of President Johnson's Civil Rights Act and the administration's war on poverty. They also had a beneficial effect on the nation's attitude towards working women. </p> <p>Bundy is survived by his wife, Mary, and their three children.</p> <p>\u0095 William Putnam Bundy, civil servant, born September 24 1917; died October 6 2000.</p>",
  "There may be plenty of cynicism about politicians, as Hugo Young says (No one trusts anyone any more, October 5). But the ever-lengthening queues for our advice surgeries, the jammed phone lines and expanding postbags tell another story - one in which constituents with desperate needs and strong opinions feel we can be approached. It would be great if, alongside all the commentary about the inadequacies of the House of Commons (and the list is pretty long), journalists gave some attention to all the rest of the job: the select and standing committees; the specialist back-bench committees; lobbying and meetings with ministers; and constituency work. <p>There is an interesting debate to be had about the changing nature of our parliamentary democracy, \"why-oh-why?\" moans about how bad it all is do not contribute to that debate.<br><b> Karen Buck MP</b> </p> <p> \u0095 So now we know the true function of the Commons. According to Catherine Bennett (G2, October 5), it's a place \"for men to show off in\". And there I've been for three-and-a-half years - campaigning outside parliament and lobbying inside on leasehold reform, the right to roam, wildlife protection, food safety, air traffic control and so on; scrutinising the executive and the civil service through the public administration select committee; making representations on behalf of constituents; and backing the modernisation of parliament. And all the time I should have been showing off and boosting the tearoom takings. <br><b>David Lepper MP</b></p>",
  "<p> A scene of dreamy serenity is not one you readily associate with Macaulay Culkin, the biggest child star since Shirley Temple, whose career disintegrated six years ago. But there he was below us on the stage of the Vaudeville with his co-star Ir\u00e8ne Jacob (the star of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours: Red), patiently playing a little low-key verbal ping pong while the technical crew worked out the lighting. </p> <p>If ever there was a context for petulance or tantrums, this was it. During a technical run-through the actors are nothing but objects to be lit, expected to do their moves and say their lines unemphatically over and over, with no one really listening. Every now and then a voice from below told them to take it from some point where the light was not quite right and they began again, in playful exchanges, savouring their lines for pitch and rhythm, getting the feel of the old British theatre. </p> <p>Just five years ago every professional and family blemish of the Culkins was heaped on to the ravenous tabloid pyre as their custody and financial battles crowded the courts. Culkin's parent manager, Kit, was, \"a father from hell\"; the Home Alone prodigy, we were led to understand, was a little Lord of the Flies himself, raining down cigarette butts from his very own 11th floor Manhattan apartment. </p> <p>By contrast, the first thing that strikes you about this willowy and rather fragile young man, now aged 20, are the pronounced good manners (\"May I smoke?\") reminiscent of that other delicate child star, Freddie Bartholomew. Culkin is clearly no Little Lord Fauntleroy, though. Nor, refreshingly, is there anything of the self-consciously brash Dead End Kid about him (brought up in the Upper East Side of New York, he could have qualified). There is a suggestion of determination in his air of manly relaxation. Here is a young man who was hit at a very early age with two of the scourges of life which pass for good fortune - fame and money in stupefying abundance - and has worked out his own way of taming them. </p> <p>Culkin talks knowingly about the destructive effect of a fever for money. \"I remember one time near the end of school year, I was walking down the road with my mother saying what I wanted to do this summer and suddenly I knew there was something she did not want to tell me. She said: 'Don't make plans this summer. You might be working.' Then you find out they had already signed the contract.\" </p> <p>Culkin's father first teamed up with his common law wife, Patricia Brentrup, in North Dakota, and they lived a hippy life before settling in New York. The children - five boys and two girls - did not discover that their parents weren't married until the custody case. Kit had appeared in bit parts on Broadway with Olivier and Burton, but made no headway. He appears to have had acting plans for all the family. Kit was briefly a taxi driver, and while Macaulay was growing up he was a sacristan at their local church, St Joseph's of Yorkville, on the Upper East Side. \"It has always given me a kind of tainted view of religion,\" says Culkin. \"He used to serve mass every day and I'd see him in the back opening up the box [the tabernacle ] and taking out the crackers [the hosts]. He was the puppeteer, kind of thing.\" In later years the description was to fit even better. </p> <p>The children were raised in various New York tenements until they struck movie gold. At the height of their success they took over two floors of a fashionable Upper West Side block. By all accounts domestic life was always chaotic. But within four years of Culkin's first success the couple's relationship was on the rocks. </p> <p>Culkin's extraordinary story is in many ways the product of a deregulated Hollywood. A Mickey Rooney might have become a world star overnight, but the contract system ensured that a star could have global fame but still earn no more than a bank manager for years. Within a year - from the $100,000 brought in by Home Alone (1990) to the $8m (plus 5% of the gross - already $375m by this year) they got from Home Alone 2 (1992) - the Culkins had been given both fame and staggering wealth, the latter alone disorientating enough for most people. </p> <p>The notion that you can actually take your life in hand and alter it occurs to very few, celebrity or nonentity; the teenager who has the maturity to realise that he has all he will ever need materially, and deliberately dumps both fame and money, is a thoroughly unobserved species. And there are plenty who would put Culkin's virtual disappearance from our screens down more to the fading appeal of an ageing child star than any choice on his part. </p> <p>Certainly, the low returns for The Pagemaster, Getting Even With Dad and Richie Rich knocked him off the list of bankable stars. But Culkin's own account of grabbing control of his life, of choosing to get off the Hollywood conveyor belt on to which his father had so effectively delivered him, is convincing. \"What happened was that my father just was not around one day. He just upped and left without explaining himself to anyone.\" Fourteen years old, Culkin saw his opportunity. </p> <p>\"When I finally got the chance to say, 'I don't want to do this any more,' I said to my family and my representatives: 'I'm stopping. Call it what you want - call it retirement, say whatever you want, because it has nothing to do with me any more. I am not a press statement.' So I went to college - and found romance.\" He makes a rueful face at this reference to his very brief marriage. In June 1998 he married 17-year-old actress Rachel Miner. They separated this August. </p> <p>Culkin might still be trapped in the business but for a fatal mistake by his father: it never occurred to Kit to involve the child in what they were doing. \"I've done 14 films and never looked at one script. I was just a machine. My father would go over what I was doing next day, I'd go on the set, do it, come home, go over what we were going to do the next morning. I had really no sense of the actual film. After a while I did not care any more. I had been wanting to stop since I was about 11.\" </p> <p> He expresses little rancour towards his father. \"I was just not willing to let him control my life on many levels. People who know him say: 'He was a great manager but I'd hate him as a father.' I haven't seen or heard from him for a bunch of years, about three and a half. Actually, I think he needs that time more than I do. Hopefully at some point he will realise some of the things he has done. But I understand my parents put me in the financial position I am in today and I am grateful for that.\" </p> <p>At the height of his career Culkin travelled with his father most of the time, and became increasingly anguished at being away from his brothers and sisters so much. This need for family life surfaced in a remark he made while telling how he was already financially independent for life: \"I found myself in a position where I could lock myself in a room and watch television for the rest of my life.\" Then, rather touchingly, he added: \"Even then my kids would still be able to go to college.\" </p> <p>They were a very close family, physically at least. \"We lived in an apartment that was basically a hallway, set with doorways but with no doors. Five of us slept in two bunk beds. It was very odd; we still lived in the same tenement for two years after we had money. We were so used to living in a one-room apartment that when we moved into a big place we were still living like we were in a small place. We were not used to having our clothes in the laundry every day. Those new things took some getting used to.\" He has recently bought an apartment for himself. </p> <p>Culkin talks with maturity about his singular brush with high-wattage fame. \"When I was young I had to turn off because I couldn't let anyone hurt me any more. It was probably when I was nine and everything was happen ing. One day you are an average kid walking down the street and the next this kid is peering in your window trying to get a glimpse of you. That was too much for me to handle. I didn't have any friends. I was one of those kids who lock themselves in a room and drown themselves in television.\" </p> <p>Finally, after four years' silence, he called his agent a year ago, and now he finds himself in Madame Melville, which has the well-worn theme of a boy being seduced by his French teacher. He is generously loyal to the team (Richard Nelson, the play's writer and director, and his fellow actors) behind an enterprise which leaves him very vulnerable. For former child stars their first kiss was the great career leap, but Culkin appears about to dive headlong into the Kama Sutra. </p> <p>Does he realise how the tabloids will treat his revealing stage debut? Imagine what they could do with, for instance, the stage direction which reads: \"She reaches inside the robe and pulls down his underpants.\" But Culkin, it seems, has been more alert to the pitfalls of stripping on stage than some other recent Hollywood imports; the underpants scene has been excised. \"We thought that was too much. It was going too far, too fast at that stage.\" </p> <p>Culkin's fastidiousness even extended to a moment when the teacher, getting a light for her cigarette, puts her hand on his thigh. That has also gone, coming too early in the encounter, they (he?) judged. One scene that has survived Culkin's pencil involves him and his co-star attempting various Kama Sutra positions (fully dressed, of course). </p> <p>Culkin has come a long way since the dark days of the mid-90s, but the scars of his meteoric early success are still visible: \"It took me a long time to realise that I had deprogrammed myself slowly. I still find myself locking myself in a room, but at least I am aware of it. I know the path that leads to that and so I know the way out.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Madame Melville previews from tomorrow at the Vaudeville Theatre (020-7836 9987).</p> <p><strong>Growing pains: the making of Macaulay</strong><br>Claire Phipps</p> <p><strong> August 26, 1980: </strong><br> Born in New York to Christopher (Kit) Culkin and Patricia Brentrup, and named after 19th-century English historian Thomas Babington Macaulay. </p> <p><strong> 1988: </strong><br> Stars in long-forgotten movie Rocket Gibraltar as Burt Lancaster's grandson. </p> <p><strong> 1989:</strong><br> Makes his mark as John Candy's prankster nephew in Uncle Buck; the same cannot be said for his role in See You in the Morning. </p> <p><strong> 1990: </strong><br> The big time beckons: Culkin's face-slapping, burglar-baiting efforts in Home Alone win him a Golden Globe nomination and help to make the film the most successful comedy in US box office history.
