  "<p>Lazio's Sinisa Mihajlovic was banned for two Champions League matches last night for racially abusing Patrick Vieira. The repercussions of Arsenal's ill-tempered draw in Rome were also felt by Gilles Grimandi, who was suspended for three games for assaulting Diego Simeone. </p> <p>Grimandi's ban will not hit Arsenal too hard because the first two matches he misses, against Sparta Prague next Wednesday and Shakhtar Donetsk the week after, are relatively meaningless now Arsenal have qualified for the second group stage. </p> <p>They will determine nothing other than whether Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team finish top of their group. Grimandi will also miss the first match of the second group stage. </p> <p>Uefa said Mihajlovic's ban was the result of \"sustained racist insults directed at Arsenal FC players throughout the match\". Vieira claimed the Yugoslavia defender had called him a \"fucking black monkey\" and had started the onslaught before the match when the teams shook hands. </p> <p>\"The Yugoslav player admitted the verbal abuse, alleging he had previously been provoked,\" Uefa said. \"Uefa's control and disciplinary body considers this to be a serious violation of the sporting principles which Uefa has always defended, especially bearing in mind the grossly humiliating nature of the verbal abuse.\" </p> <p>Mihajlovic insisted he had been called a \"Gypsy\" by Vieira but there was no mention of punishment for the Arsenal midfielder in the sanctions handed out. </p> <p>Grimandi's ban comes after he struck Simeone off the ball, leaving the Argentine with six stitches in a head wound. His actions were condemned yesterday by Wenger. </p> <p>\"You must always keep control of your behaviour,\" the manager said. \"That's part of your responsibility. I encourage my players always to concentrate on the game. </p> <p>\"He knows he shouldn't have reacted at all but Simeone is quite well known for provoking people. He is not an angel.\" </p> <p>It is the second time in 11 days the Frenchman has been banned for an incident missed by the match officials. Last week he received a one-match suspension for stamping on the hand of Liverpool's Gary McAllister at Highbury. </p> <p>Grimandi was also sent off against Barcelona in last season's Champions League for elbowing Josep Guardiola. \"It's surprising because basically he is a fair player,\" Wenger said. \"But when he is upset he sometimes has an uncontrolled reaction.\" </p> <p>Arsenal will not contest the suspension or the \u00a38,300 fine they received for three offences: arriving on the pitch three minutes late before the match, having to be called three times before they emerged from the dressing-room for the second half and their part in a fight after the final whistle. </p> <p>Lazio were fined \u00a329,000 after objects were thrown at players and match officials, and for Simeone's and Juan Veron's more serious roles in that post-match scuffle with Arsenal players. </p> <p>Uefa and Fifa have joined forces to try to convince Europe's heads of state that football should have a special place in European law which would prevent the transfer system from being overturned as illegal by the European Commission. </p> <p>\"We call on the EU and national governments to act now and help us safeguard the future well-being of European football,\" read a statement from Uefa's 51 members, who met a joint Fifa-Uefa task force yesterday. </p> <p>Football has until October 31 to offer an alternative system to the EC. \"We're optimistic,\" a Uefa spokesman said.</p>",
  "<p>Nobody who watched any of Nigel Winterburn's heart-pumping, fist-clenching 440 games for Arsenal would doubt that he would have run through a brick outhouse for the club. What has not been generally known until now is that, along with his former team-mates, he also leaped over hurdles and bounded over hoops for Arsenal as part of a new science, known as plymetrics, initiated by their manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to build the players' explosive energy. </p> <p>Wenger also introduced food supplements and hired a chef so that the players' diets could be strictly regulated and monitored. All of which must have made Winterburn believe he had crossed London by Tardis when he arrived at cosy old West Ham, where dear old 'Arry Redknapp is more comfortable with the F-word than the F-plan. </p> <p>As a great old pro, of course, Winterburn, 37 in December, has taken it in his admittedly slowing stride. And though for the first time today, he will walk out for a West Ham-Arsenal scrap from the claret-and-blue corner, his Highbury memories will be locked away as securely as all the medals he earned in north London. </p> <p>The fixture, like most London derbies, has a history of bad blood, and much spilling of it, last year's game at Upton Park descending to gutter level when Arsenal's Patrick Vieira was shown a red card and showered Neil Ruddock with spittle on the way off. Winterburn will not be surprised if the rules are again less adhered to than they were expected to be in this morning's Mike Tyson-Andrew Golota fight. </p> <p>He says: \"As you can imagine, I looked up the date of this match as soon as the fixture list came out. I'm not expecting too many problems from my old Arsenal pals, but if it does kick up a bit rough, I will still be the first to offer a handshake at the end. </p> <p>\"I've always said that it is only a game of football but, while you're out on that pitch for 90 minutes, it's more or less your life, and fans want to see that, they want to see you getting stuck in and working hard. At the end, though, all the players should be man enough to shake hands.\" </p> <p>For a man renowned for his bulging-eyeballs style and goalscoring celebrations that could get him a place in an American relay squad, Winterburn is quite philosophical on the quiet. One might expect him to harbour resentment against Arsenal, where he had hoped to finish his career, or at least demonstrate only sulky acceptance of playing out his days at West Ham. Yet he says: \"I would never change anything I've had or anything I've got. When I look back and remember being shown the door as a kid at Birmingham City and look where I am now, I really haven't got much to grumble about. </p> <p>\"I had a choice in the summer: to stay at Arsenal for sentimental reasons or come here and play regularly. Once I came to the conclusion that I couldn't live without playing, the decision was easy. And I'm fully committed to West Ham. Otherwise, I wouldn't have joined, I would have packed the game in.\" </p> <p>Winterburn had long known that a cocky young kid with a wicked left foot would one day bound into Arsenal's marble halls and work happily as his apprentice for a year or two before showing his gratitude by seizing the shirt off his dressing-room peg. When Winterburn observed the Brazilian brilliance of Silvinho in training, he knew the future had arrived. </p> <p>He says: \"Trying to be friendly to someone and at the same time trying to keep them out of the team takes a special mentality. That's what I was trying to do - to stop it for as long as possible and make it as difficult for him as possible. But he is a very good player, and his forward play, the quickness of his feet, is fantastic.\" </p> <p>West Ham, remarkably, have yet to win at home, though despite facing an Arsenal side unbeaten in Europe or the Premiership since the opening day - a 1-0 defeat to Sunderland - Winterburn is confident today could be one when they blow away reputations rather than bubbles. </p> <p>The Hammers rounded off a tremendous performance against Manchester United at Upton Park with two goals in the final four minutes to secure a draw, and came from behind to get a point against a Liverpool side who were content to escape with one. Winterburn says that they could easily have won both games, while conceding, surely proof that he is now fully versed in the capriciousness of life at West Ham, that they almost threw both away. </p> <p>He does not linger on such things, any more than he lingers on the incomprehensible fact that, in an era when England can barely find a player to stand on his left foot, let alone kick with it, he has only two caps. Putting on his philosopher's hat again, he says: \"I think it can be very damaging to worry about something you cannot change so I have tried not to do that.\" </p> <p>He admits, however, that he would love to have played for his country a few more times and he is disappointed that Arsenal did not find their true Champions League form while he was still there. So regrets, yes, he has a few. But given his background, too few to mention.</p>",
  "<p>Everyone puts together a personal checklist when they go house hunting, whether it is a south-facing garden, period features, utility room or cellar. But how many people make a mental note to check the likely impact of global warming on their chosen residence? </p> <p>Environmental experts say that soon more and more of us will be assessing the chances of flood damage on our prospective homes. With many people in the UK still on flood watch, the Environment Agency said 5m people live in flood-risk areas and the prospect of being engulfed in water is now a fact of daily life in England and Wales. The agency says flood reports have doubled in the last 100 years. </p> <p>Climate change means residents could see up to a \"10-fold increase in flood risk over the next century. A typical flood that might now happen on average once in 100 years could occur as frequently as every 10 or 20 years in future. In short, today's extreme floods could become tomorrow's norm,\" the agency adds. </p> <p>The floods that swept through the south-east last month are offered as proof of the seriousness of the situation. The floods, the worst in 40 years, forced residents in East Sussex and Kent from their homes and businesses when rivers broke their banks. </p> <p>Lewes was stranded when the River Ouse overflowed. Hundreds of homes in the Kentish villages of Yalding, Wateringbury, East Farleigh, Laddingford and East Peckham were also flood when the Medway and its tributaries burst their banks. </p> <p>When the water subsides householders surveying the wreckage might find it hard to believe their home isn't blighted and impossible to sell. However, a spokesman from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says all is not lost. </p> <p>\"Homeowners shouldn't have any problems selling a house that has been properly dried out and had the electrics and gas checked,\" he says. But if buyers know the area has been flooded in the past it may have an effect on the value of the property. </p> <p>Ever the optimists, estate agents deny that the floods will have an impact on property prices in the area. A spokesman for Hoskin, a Crawley-based agent that covers the area where some of the worst flooding occurred, said that Lewes in East Sussex would continue to be a desirable place to live. \"There is a relatively limited supply of property and a lot of people want to live there,\" he said. </p> <p>Residents of towns like Lewes, built many years ago on spots vulnerable to flooding, have little choice but to weather whatever nature sends them. But with 3m homes planned for the south-east by 2016 there are growing concerns about where developers are siting new developments. </p> <p>Earlier this month, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) published research into the potential impact of inland flooding. </p> <p>It is not surprising that the insurers want to cut the number of homes at risk from flooding - after all, the industry found itself meeting a \u00a312m bill for the damage caused by floods in Yorkshire and County Durham in June. In recent weeks there have been hints at premium hikes unless more care is taken over homes in vulnerable areas. </p> <p>Insurers have called for a halt to all developments on flood plains or for improved drainage and specially designed buildings. In response the government has promised tighter guidance and stronger powers for local authorities to prevent homes being built in particularly risky areas. </p> <p>For ordinary homes, RICS says most materials should dry out with the help of dehumidifiers. Brickwork, concrete, timber in good condition and plaster should all survive a soaking. Plasterboard, chipboard and plywood, on the other hand, are unlikely to survive. </p> <p>Floods are not bad news for everyone. Sussex police warned that cowboy builders were launching their own brand of clean-up operation, exploiting flood-stricken homeowners. RICS urges res idents to take advice from insurers or a professional such as a surveyor to determine the extent of the damage and the remedies needed. </p> <p>The Environment Agency urges householders in risk areas to be prepared by taking some commonsense precautions. Keep a list of useful numbers to hand, including the floodline, 0845-988-1188. </p> <p>Have sandbags or floorboards available to block doorways and airbricks. Make up a flood kit including torch, blankets, waterproof clothing, wellingtons and key personal documents. Consider a flood plan and discuss it with your family or neighbours. Make sure you know how to switch off gas and electricity. Think about where you would move your pets and your car and get into the habit of storing valuables upstairs or high up. </p> <p>After flooding, the Buildings Research Establishment recommends householders check for structural damage, check gas and electricity supplies are off and whether drainage is working, photograph the damage, contact insurers and remove wet carpets and fur niture. Clean walls and floors and open windows and doors to start the drying process. </p> <p>Although experts are reluctant to blame the recent floods entirely on global warming, climatic changes in general are giving the Environment Agency more than a little cause for concern. It hopes, with the help of an advertising campaign, that it can persuade householders to take the risk just as seriously. </p> <p>Insurers: <a href=\"http://www.abi.org.uk\">www.abi.org.uk;</a> </p> <p>Environment Agency: <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk\">environment-agency.gov.uk</a> the environment agency.gov.uk.

  "<p>Britain's lenders spend, at a conservative estimate, tens of millions persuading people to borrow. But Britain's money advice centres have just a tiny percentage of that sum to deal with the ravages of problem debt: relationship break-ups, bad health, homelessness or suicide. </p> <p>This week the government hauled in banks, credit card companies and other lenders to a \"debt summit\" in a bid to call a halt to \"irresponsible loans\". </p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry is concerned at the ease with which credit is made available and the lack of checks on the ability of borrowers to repay. But while the move is welcome, it will do little to ease queues outside money advice centres. </p> <p>This week, Jobs &amp; Money went to see the reality of Britain's growing debt difficulties, spending a day with money advice worker Linda Mullholland, in Bristol. Linda, 43, is a gamekeeper turned poacher. After her two children were born, she took a part-time job chasing debtors for consumer loan company Welbeck Finance. </p> <p>\"I felt the work was immoral. I spent most of my time after people persuaded into borrowing when they had little hope of repaying if they suffered the slightest mishap. I was told to squeeze blood out of stone,\" she says. </p> <p>She started with the Bristol Debt Advice Centre (BDAC) in 1990 as a volunteer. Now she works four days a week. </p> <p> <strong> 9.00 am :</strong> Her day starts at the BDAC office in run-down Easton - a far cry from the luxury homes in Clifton, waterside warehouse conversions and new financial sector offices that Bristol prefers to show the world. </p> <p> <strong> 9.30am:</strong> She motors to her destination for the morning's outreach work on a 1940s council estate. Knowle West has the unenviable twin reputations of being the poverty and heroin capital of the south-west. In Knowle West she holds a once a week session in the Filwood Hope drop-in advice centre, a local churches-backed project surrounded by boarded-up shops, a bookie's and a sweetshop where the goods are kept behind security screens. </p> <p> <strong> 10.15am:</strong> Her first customer is Alison Wilson. Until recently, Alison, husband Jimmy and their three children had been keeping their financial heads above water. Now they owe nearly \u00a37,000, mostly to the Inland Revenue but also to Lloyds-TSB, and consumer loans. </p> <p>The family's problem stems from self-employed builder Jimmy's back injury. After seven months on a hospital waiting list he had a disc removed. But he is unable to work and may never do so again. Alison is studying to be a nursery nurse but will qualify late next year. </p> <p>The family lives on \u00a3135 per week income support and \u00a335 per week child benefit, a total of \u00a3166 a week or \u00a34.74 per person per day. Their rent, community charge and school meals are paid for. They have no savings, so offering to pay a proportion of the debts is impossible. </p> <p> <strong> 10.45am:</strong> After outlining her problems, Alison says her husband thinks bankruptcy could be a way out. But Linda Mullholland knows the Wilsons cannot afford bankruptcy fees, normally \u00a3370, but cut to \u00a3250 for those on income support. \"There is no point in offering anything, as we have nothing. Going bust would make a fresh start,\" says Alison. </p> <p>But Linda warns her that this action would still leave her - as opposed to Jimmy - with bank consumer loan debts. However, she thinks a court would probably order repayment at \u00a31 a month. </p> <p>The \u00a3250 bankruptcy fee is a real stumbling block. But until they can find it, Linda will write to the family's creditors telling them what is likely to happen. </p> <p>Finance companies will be less likely to waste time and money chasing the Wilsons if they know Jimmy is petitioning for bankruptcy. But Alison is worried about bailliffs. Linda reassures her. She says: \"They're not interested in normal furniture or in your broken-down van. Nor will the official receiver waste time and money pursuing you. Just make sure you do not get left money or win the National Lottery.\" </p> <p>She tells her about Yorkshire Building Society's Cash Transactor which gives undischarged bankrupts a basic account provided they can find \u00a325. </p> <p> <strong> 11.30am:</strong> Alison says she feels \"a bit happier, a bit lighter. I won't panic if the Inland Revenue sends heavy letters. This service is brilliant - you can never get through on the phone. Our whole life is having to change. But if we can start again, we could make a go.\" </p> <p> <strong> 11.45am:</strong> Linda meets Debbie Jones, 23, and eight month son Trent. Debbie has two part-time jobs and her husband, Darren, 29, is in full-time work although recent cut backs have slashed his overtime. They both have bank accounts. </p> <p> <strong> 12.00pm:</strong> Debbie's big worry is being threatened with a fine for not paying the TV licence. But it is clear there are multiple problems - they owe rent, their working families tax credit book has been impounded for a \"scanning check\", their phone is cut off, they're behind with water payments and buy gas and electricity expensively through pre-payment meters. </p> <p>And Linda discovers more \"forgotten\" debts. They owe Darren's mum \u00a3290. They are behind on cash owed to door-to-door lenders Provident Financial and \u00a3579 to credit company HFC. The Social Fund is still after Darren for a 1993 debt. He also owes the taxman nearly \u00a33,000 from the same period. Including benefits, the family has \u00a3265 a week coming in. They are being threatened with eviction for rent arrears. </p> <p> <strong> 12.10pm:</strong> Linda phones the council housing department to see how near the family is to losing their home. She fails to find the right official. </p> <p> <strong> 12.15pm:</strong> Although Debbie is still talking about Christmas and birthday presents, she now realises how serious her position is. \"The eviction is the big number one priority. The consumer loans and the Inland Revenue are way down the list,\" says Linda. </p> <p> <strong> 12.30pm:</strong> Debbie admits to having only a vague idea of the family's weekly spending. With Linda's help, she draws up a statement of income and expenditure - essential if Linda is to persuade creditors to reduce their demands. </p> <p> <strong> 12.45pm:</strong> The family could, Linda calculates, afford to pay \u00a325 a week off their loans. She says she will write to tell creditors. She sets up a plan of action but it will cost \u00a350 to remove the eviction warrant from the court. Debbie promises to take cash to the rent office as soon as Darren gets paid. She is told about Easicash, a Post Office plan to help with TV licence arrears. She gets a helpline number if bailiffs appear. </p> <p> <strong> 1.30pm:</strong> Returns to the office with a sandwich grabbed from behind the security grille at the local baker. </p> <p> <strong> 2.00pm:</strong> She chases the council again to get Debbie's eviction forestalled. </p> <p> <strong> 2.15pm:</strong> She starts to work on writing to Alison's creditors - a mix of standard letters and individual pleadings. \"I give them 14 days to get back. Otherwise I chase them. One client had 27 creditors. Creditors can be more reasonable if you explain what's happening. They won't want to waste money on unrecoverable debts.\" </p> <p> <strong> 2.45pm:</strong> She faxes the benefits agency to get a client on Fuel Direct so gas and electricity payments are paid out of income support. </p> <p> <strong> 3.15pm:</strong> Linda finally gets through to the council about Debbie's eviction. It is closer than anyone feared. She starts to try to stop it with offers of a firm payment later that week and court action to remove the warrant. </p> <p> <strong> 3.45pm:</strong> Phones Charter Trust, a hire purchase firm threatening to repossess a car. The client is six months in arrears, amounting to some \u00a3840. But the car will fetch little. She hopes an offer of \u00a3100 a month will suffice. They promise to get back to her. </p> <p> <strong> 4.15pm:</strong> Phones a client threatened with eviction by the council. She had already arranged one rescheduling of this debt. The client only has a temporary tenancy, over which the courts have no discretion. So it is down to pleading on her behalf. \"She has mental health difficulties. Maybe she paid the money into the wrong account,\" says Linda. </p> <p> All client names have been changed</p>",
  "The background to Scottish Labour's convulsions after Donald Dewar's death is the fact the Labour party no longer has sole control of executive government in Edinburgh or Cardiff, where a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition is being formed. <p>Looked at from London, this must look worrying. The personal contacts and friendships that would help ensure that devolution did not bring about dangerous division are no longer reliably in place. But viewed from Edinburgh and Cardiff, the picture looks very different. </p> <p>Labour may have introduced devolution but it has had difficulty profiting from it. The party performed poorly in the first devolution elections. In Scotland its 34% share of the party list vote was lower than in any Westminster election since 1931. In Wales, its 35% share broke records as far back as 1918. </p> <p>This was not some mid-term protest reaction to the performance and policies of the Blair government. In both Scotland and Wales more people thought things had improved since Labour had come to power than thought they had got worse, at least as far as living standards, education and unemployment were concerned. Whatever people thought of the record of the government seemed to make little difference to whether or not they remained loyal to Labour in their new national elections. </p> <p>Labour's difficulties lay elsewhere. People who were still willing to vote Labour for Westminster proved reluctant to back the party when it came to the Scottish or Welsh contests. Many opted for the nationalists instead. </p> <p>In Scotland, Labour's share of the vote was no less than 9% adrift of what it would have secured in a Westminster election. In Wales, the equivalent figure was as much as 13%. Without this devolution gap Labour would have done pretty much as well as it had in 1997. There would be no need of a coalition in Wales and maybe not even in Scotland. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the nationalists rode high. In Scotland they were 7% better off than they would have been in a Westminster byelection. In Wales they were no less than 17% ahead. Without the devolution gap, the \"quiet earthquake\" experienced in last year's Welsh election would not have registered on the Richter scale at all. </p> <p>Nothing that Labour has done in the first year of devo lution has closed the devolution gap. For example, the most recent Scottish poll puts Labour and the Scottish National party (SNP) even stevens when it came to people's intentions on voting for the House of Commons, but no less than 14% behind in the race for the Scottish parliament. </p> <p>So what accounts for the devolution gap? Why did voters who would not consider voting nationalist in a Westminster election do so when it came to the devolved elections? </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, perhaps, many voters in Scotland and Wales are doubtful about how far London looks after them. In both countries no more than one in three believes that the UK government works in their country's best long-term interests \"just about always\" or \"most of the time\". So when invited to elect a parliament for Scotland and an assembly for Wales, many were looking for a party that would use the new institutions to redress the balance. </p> <p>Many doubted Labour fitted the bill. Just 40% of people in Scotland trust Labour to look after their interests. In Wales, the equivalent figure is 44%. In contrast 68% in Scotland trust the SNP to look after Scots' interests and in Wales 82% say the same of Plaid Cymru. </p> <p>And it was these perceptions that brought new votes into the nationalist camp. Our research looked at those who said they would not have voted nationalist in a Westminster election who actually did so in last year's devolved election, broken down by the level of trust they had in the ability of various institutions to advance Scottish/Welsh interests.

  "The battle to become the first minister of Scotland started yesterday, just a day after Donald Dewar's funeral, as two Scottish cabinet ministers declared their intention to stand. <p>The contest will be as brief as it has come swiftly: the finance minister, Jack McConnell, and the enterprise minister, Henry McLeish, have until tomorrow to garner support for their campaigns. </p> <p>In a controversial move, Labour has put its usual election rules to one side and set up a fast-track procedure to elect an interim leader on Saturday. The winner will be nominated as first minister. </p> <p>Under the terms of the Scotland Act, a new first minister must be in place by November 7. Labour says its usual electoral college system - comprising MSPs, unions and the party's executive - cannot provide a candidate in time. </p> <p>The party intends to follow up tomorrow's vote with a full election later in the year. But it is understood that whoever wins a majority from the 54 MSPs and 27 executive members who will vote in Stirling this weekend will stand unopposed in the full election. </p> <p>The move has led to backbench claims that Labour is trying to bypass democracy. </p> <p>The Scottish National party leader, John Swinney, said: \"Labour's apparatchiks are dodging a real leadership con test and cutting their ordinary members out of the process.\" </p> <p>In the days after Mr Dewar's death, supporters of Mr McLeish, 52, launched a campaign to have him appointed without opposition. The move played badly with backbench MSPs and Mr McConnell, 40, has refused not to stand. </p> <p>Mr McLeish, the MSP for Fife Central, is the favourite to win tomorrow's vote. Supporters claim he has the backing of every Scottish cabinet minister and many of their deputies. </p> <p>The swift contest may, however, benefit Mr McConnell, MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw. Some backbenchers are annoyed at what they see as an attempt to deny them a vote. Mr McConnell is also said to have less support among the full electoral college than Mr McLeish. </p> <p>Mr McLeish, a former professional footballer, helped Mr Dewar steer through Westminster the legislation which created the Scottish parliament. He is the most experienced minister and has a long-held desire to be first minister. </p> <p>He is believed to be the favoured choice of the chancellor, Gordon Brown, but a perceived reticence to enter political tussles when things are going wrong for Labour may play badly for him among the backbenchers. </p> <p>Launching his campaign, he said: \"This is a time when unity, experienced leadership and solidity of purpose will be needed most of all.\" </p> <p>Mr McConnell is a former general secretary of the Scottish Labour party, but is relatively untested as a minister. </p> <p>His supporters say he is a talented backroom fixer and he might take the Scottish party on a more radical path than Mr McLeish.</p>",
  "The background to Scottish Labour's convulsions after Donald Dewar's death is the fact the Labour party no longer has sole control of executive government in Edinburgh or Cardiff, where a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition is being formed. <p>Looked at from London, this must look worrying. The personal contacts and friendships that would help ensure that devolution did not bring about dangerous division are no longer reliably in place. But viewed from Edinburgh and Cardiff, the picture looks very different. </p> <p>Labour may have introduced devolution but it has had difficulty profiting from it. The party performed poorly in the first devolution elections. In Scotland its 34% share of the party list vote was lower than in any Westminster election since 1931. In Wales, its 35% share broke records as far back as 1918. </p> <p>This was not some mid-term protest reaction to the performance and policies of the Blair government. In both Scotland and Wales more people thought things had improved since Labour had come to power than thought they had got worse, at least as far as living standards, education and unemployment were concerned. Whatever people thought of the record of the government seemed to make little difference to whether or not they remained loyal to Labour in their new national elections. </p> <p>Labour's difficulties lay elsewhere. People who were still willing to vote Labour for Westminster proved reluctant to back the party when it came to the Scottish or Welsh contests. Many opted for the nationalists instead. </p> <p>In Scotland, Labour's share of the vote was no less than 9% adrift of what it would have secured in a Westminster election. In Wales, the equivalent figure was as much as 13%. Without this devolution gap Labour would have done pretty much as well as it had in 1997. There would be no need of a coalition in Wales and maybe not even in Scotland. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the nationalists rode high. In Scotland they were 7% better off than they would have been in a Westminster byelection. In Wales they were no less than 17% ahead. Without the devolution gap, the \"quiet earthquake\" experienced in last year's Welsh election would not have registered on the Richter scale at all. </p> <p>Nothing that Labour has done in the first year of devolution has closed the devolution gap. For example, the most recent Scottish poll puts Labour and the Scottish National party (SNP) even stevens when it came to people's intentions on voting for the House of Commons, but no less than 14% behind in the race for the Scottish parliament. </p> <p>So what accounts for the devolution gap? Why did voters who would not consider voting nationalist in a Westminster election do so when it came to the devolved elections? </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, perhaps, many voters in Scotland and Wales are doubtful about how far London looks after them. In both countries no more than one in three believes that the UK government works in their country's best long-term interests \"just about always\" or \"most of the time\". So when invited to elect a parliament for Scotland and an assembly for Wales, many were looking for a party that would use the new institutions to redress the balance. </p> <p>Many doubted Labour fitted the bill. Just 40% of people in Scotland trust Labour to look after their interests. In Wales, the equivalent figure is 44%. In contrast 68% in Scotland trust the SNP to look after Scots' interests and in Wales 82% say the same of Plaid Cymru. </p> <p>And it was these perceptions that brought new votes into the nationalist camp.

  "<p>It was the night before the Frankfurt Book Fair and all was quiet but for the soft drone of 1,000 publishers decamping en masse to the continent for the annual bookish beer bash (18 - 23 October). This year, the word on almost everyone's lips is 'ebook'.</p> <p>For this, so far, has been the year of the electronic book, and the Frankfurt Book Fair will be its showground. For most publishers it is not so much that the electronic book has arrived, but that it will not go away. No sooner has the latest incarnation of the digital book (be that Glassbook or Microsoft Reader) been launched, failed to set the world alight and been dismissed, than another has come along promising greater clarity, less cost and a more impressive line-up of authors. </p> <p>In the week before Frankfurt three announcements have once again pushed the ebook to the forefront of publishers' minds. Two, which emanated from the US, were met with typical American hyperbole and razzmatazz, while the third, from the UK end of the Random House empire, was understated to the point of near transparency.</p> <p>In order of razzmatazz, the first announcement came from ebrary.com, the online-only library, which revealed an \"unprecedented\" joint investment by three of the world's largest publishing groups, Random House, Pearson and the McGraw-Hill companies. Ebrary claims that it is the first company to combine the accessibility and searchability of content demanded by Web users with copyright security and revenue streams sought by most sensible publishers. According to the company, users of its service will be able to find, view and interact with documents without pre-paying or subscribing to the service. Instead, he or she will pay for the convenience of copying or printing pages, similar to using a library photocopier. Quite how the thing will work in practice is anyone's guess, but Ebrary is offering demonstrations in Frankfurt.</p> <p> The second announcement came from Gemstar-TV Guide International, which bought the two leading e-book companies - Softbook Press and NuvoMedia - earlier in the year, and has rolled the separate products into one new ebook (and cleverly called it the Gemstar eBook). More impressive was the news that it had signed content agreements with five US publishers which will see them release six titles from 'bestselling' authors exclusively on the Gemstar eBook for 90 days before publication as a proper (ie paper) book. </p> <p> The publishers involved are the Pearson-owned Penguin Putnam, Simon &amp; Schuster, Warner Books, St Martin's Press and Harlequin (better known in the UK as its imprint Mills &amp; Boon). The authors include Patricia Cornwell, Robert Ludlum, James Patterson and Ken Follett. Ebook readers will be able to download the digital books using the modem installed in each Gemstar ebook and dialling directly to a Gemstar server. According to Gemstar CEO Henry Yuen: \"When people look back 100 years from now this is going to be the turning point.\" No doubt he is right, but with the Gemstar ebooks costing $300 and $700 (depending on whether you want colour or not), Mr Yuen may find that a sizeable proportion of the reading population is prepared to take a bypass.</p> <p> The third announcement came from Random House UK, which proudly proclaimed itself to be the first British-based trade publisher to offer an electronic publishing programme. This dubious boast was backed up by a vague press release which stated that it was RH UK's \"firm intention\" to set up such a list at an unspecified future date, which was unlikely to be before the New Year. However, authors included on what can truly be termed a virtual list included such luminaries as Roddy Doyle, Thomas Harris, Ben Elton and Irvine Welsh. </p> <p>\"Given the lack of clarity still surrounding economic models for ebook publishing, it would be easy for publishers to sit back and do nothing,\" said Gail Rebuck of RH, acknowledging that the market was \"likely\" to become significant in the future and that RH UK needed to \"protect our authors and our own interests by a properly resourced commitment\". It was the subtext of the announcement, rather than the explicit launch of the elist, that was important; it will be surprising if RH's move is not widely copied by other UK-based trade publishers over the next few months.</p> <p>The problem is simple: the internet does not respect geographic location. When Gemstar launches Patricia Cornwell's latest work in ebook format, it will be downloadable all over the world. This is problematic if you are Patricia Cornwell's print publisher, with a licence to publish in the UK and a publication date some months behind the book's arrival on the world wide web. It becomes even more problematic if you are Random House UK and your larger US cousin has already set up a digital imprint with a number of your authors on it. </p> <p>As Random House realises, if it does not own and control the electronic rights of its authors worldwide then its stature in a marketplace increasingly focused on digital publishing will be vastly diminished - as will its ability to find, nurture and sell new British writing. As it admits, it wanted to \"establish a location distinct from the US for the provision of ebooks within its own principal territories of exclusive operation\".</p> <p>Whether RH UK, or other UK trade publishers, will achieve this aim remains to be seen. What is clear, however, is that the traditional 'big book' of the Frankfurt Book Fair may not be a book at all.</p>",
  "<p>At around four o'clock I finally strolled into the living room, where Jim had spent the last couple of years researching his Ph.D. Today this involved playing Tomb Raider with Simon. They both managed to mumble hello to me, though since neither of them managed to look up from the screen I could just as easily have been the creature from the black lagoon wandering in to put the kettle on. Jim and Simon looked like the \"Before\" and \"After\" drawings in the Charles Atlas body-building adverts. Jim was tall and muscular with the healthy complexion of a boy who'd been skiing every winter since he was five years old, and by contrast, Simon was skinny, pallid and awkward. If they made Tomb Raider any more realistic, Lara Croft would turn round and say out of the TV screen, \"Stop staring at my tits like that, you little creep,\" and blast him off the sofa. He had a promising career serving pints of lager in plastic glasses to students of the university from which he had graduated some years ago. He had got the job on the day he'd left and was hoping to earn enough money to one day pay off the debts he had accumulated on the other side of the bar.</p> <p>At that moment the front door slammed and Paul returned home, dumping a pile of tatty exercise books on the kitchen table with a martyred sigh that was far too obviously intended to elicit concerned enquiries about his day and consequently received none.</p> <p>\"Dear oh dear,\" said Paul, but we all still refused to bite. He put a carton of milk back in the fridge and took a couple of old tea bags out of the sink, tutting quietly to himself. His sighs not only announced his irritation that everyone else didn't tidy up as they went along, but also his annoyance that it should be left to him to clear up when he had already done a full day's teaching. It was as if he was implying that Simon's evening job or Jim's Ph.D or my composing at my keyboard were somehow less-demanding work. The fact that this was true was entirely beside the point.</p> <p>The four of us had shared this place for a couple of years now. None of them had known me when I had first taken the room, and in some ways that was how I preferred to keep things. The flat boasted views across the splendour that is Balham High Road, and was conveniently located above a shop, where we could pop down and buy halal meat at any time of the day or night. But it was not the tatty run-down flat that you would expect four men sharing to wallow in; there was a strict cleaning rota, in which we took turns to leave all the clearing up for Paul.</p> <p>Paul put what was left of a slab of butter into the butter dish and then folded the foil neatly before throwing it in the bin. Since talking to the entire room failed to get him any attention, he attempted to address someone directly.</p> <p>\"Michael, how was your day?\"</p> <p>\"It's been a fucking disaster,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Oh no, what happened?\" he replied, sounding genuinely concerned.</p> <p>\"Bloody paper boy woke me up at seven o'clock to tell me he's not going to deliver the paper to the end of my bed any more. He said his mother thinks it's weird. I distinctly remember saying to him when we first agreed on the arrangement that it would probably be wise not to mention it to his parents.\"</p> <p>There was a pause.</p> <p>\"No. I told his mother,\" confessed Paul with the defiant air of a man who had been preparing himself for this confrontation.</p> <p>\"You! What on earth did you do that for?\"</p> <p>\"Well, for a start I am not particularly wild about you handing out the front door keys of our flat to a thirteen-year-old delinquent.\"</p> <p>\"He's not a delinquent.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, he is a delinquent, and do you know how I know that? Because I teach him. Troy is in my class. And the day before yesterday, at seven a.m., I walked out of the bathroom stark bollock naked to see Troy standing there on the landing staring at me.\"</p> <p>At that moment Jim laughed so much he had to spit his tea back into the mug. \"What did you say?\"</p> <p>\"Well, I said, _Hello, Troy.\"</p> <p>\"What did he say?\"</p> <p>\"He said, 'Hello, Mr Hitchcock.' He looked a little confused, to tell the truth. In fact, it was pretty bad luck on his part as well; he'd been trying to avoid me for a few days because he owed me an essay on the character of Piggy in Lord of the Flies. I think for a moment he thought I'd broken into this house at seven in the morning with no clothes on just to ask him for his essay.\"</p> <p>I was still irritated. \"So you bumped into him on the landing. So what? Doesn't mean you have to tell his mother.\"</p> <p>\"I am his teacher. It doesn't look too good, does it? boy visits naked teacher's flat before lessons. Besides, I do not appreciate having to tell my class that the correct pronunciation of my name is Mr Hitchcock, not Mr Titchy-cock.\"</p> <p>Jim's tea had now been spat out so many times it was undrinkable.</p> <p>\"And so, at last night's parents' evening,\" Paul continued, \"I told his mother that her son had a key to my flat and that the previous morning he had seen me naked.\"</p> <p>\"That probably wasn't the best way to put it.\"</p> <p>\"Well, with the benefit of hindsight I realize I might have phrased it differently. She went mad and started hitting me with her shoe. Had to be pulled off by the deputy head.\"</p> <p>Paul looked hurt to be the unwitting subject of such general amusement.</p> <p>\"Don't take it personally, Paul,\" I said, \"we're not laughing at you.\" \"I am,\" said Jim.</p> <p>\"Yeah, I am as well actually,\" added Simon.</p> <p>Paul settled down to do his marking, and his pupils got far lower marks than they would have done if we had been nicer to him. He was clearly one of those teachers who are unable to keep control in the classroom. There was just something about him that marked him out as the injured wildebeest limping on the edge of the herd. He always tried to play this down, even when one of the pupils sold his car.</p> <p>I don't know why they felt they needed to go to such lengths to wind him up when he seemed to get infuriated by the littlest things. He once told us that from now on he would only be removing his own hairs from the gunge that was blocking the plughole, since no-one else ever seemed to do it, and so we found him crouched in an empty bath trying to separate the red hairs from all the others. It wasn't that Paul was petty, it was just that he got annoyed when anyone squeezed the toothpaste from the wrong end of the tube. In fact, all sorts of things about us aggravated him.</p> <p>We sat around the kitchen table for a bit longer and then Jim announced that he was going to make a brew. Paul always declined Jim's offer of tea because the way Jim made tea was the essence of what Paul found so irritating about him.</p> <p>Jim's tea-making routine was a triumph of day-dreaming inefficiency. First he would take the mugs from the cupboard and arrange them on a tray. Then he would stop near the sink and look a little lost for a while as he tried to remember what it was that he had been meaning to do. Then it would come back to him: get the milk out of the fridge. After the milk had been poured into each cup he would get the tea bags and put them into the teapot. And then, when he had done all that, when he had got everything ready and realized he'd got out one mug too many and so put it back in the cupboard, and then put the sugar bowl on the tray and decided that there was nothing else he had to do, then he would put the kettle on.</p> <p>For Paul, this sequence alone made Jim virtually impossible to live with. And he didn't just put the kettle on last, he also filled it right to the top so it took far longer than necessary for three cups of tea. And while it was taking an eternity to boil he would just stand there waiting, occasionally moving the mugs about on the tray. And all the while he would be completely unaware that Paul was about to explode with frustration at the impracticality of this order of doing things. Try as he might, Paul could not let Jim do things his way. I knew that within sixty seconds he would ask Jim why he didn't put the kettle on first.</p> <p>\"Jim, why don't you put the kettle on first?\" he asked three seconds later.</p> <p>\"Hmmm?\"</p> <p>\"I was just saying, it would be a bit quicker if you put the kettle on first. You know, before you put out the mugs and everything.\"</p> <p>Jim gave an indifferent shrug. \"Well, it wouldn't boil any quicker, would it.\"</p> <p>He was as slow to see Paul's logic as he was at making tea.</p> <p>\"No, but it would boil sooner, because you would've put it on earlier, and then you could do the tea bags and milk and everything while it was boiling.\" He had to stop himself screaming the last four words in Jim's face. Jim was bemused by his flatmate's concern.</p> <p> \"They're not in a hurry to go out or anything, are they? You're not in a hurry to go out, are you, Simon?\"</p> <p>Simon looked up from the paper. \"Me? No.\"</p> <p>\"No-one's in a hurry, so what does it matter?\"</p> <p>I could see Paul's frustration rising; his face went bright red, which at least had the consolation of making his little ginger beard less prominent. \"It's just a really inefficient way to make a cup of tea.\"</p> <p>\"But you're not even having a cup.\"</p> <p>\"No, I'm not, because it's so annoying that you always do it wrong.\" And with that he stomped out of the room. Jim looked completely perplexed.</p> <p>\"Have I been putting sugar in Paul_s tea when he doesn_t take it or something?\"</p> <p>Simon mumbled that he didn't think so and Jim shrugged and stood by the sink for a while and after five minutes realized that he hadn't pressed the \"on\" button on the side of the kettle.</p> <p>When the tea was made, the remaining three of us drank it in contemplative silence. Simon was reading the \"Dear Deirdre\" column in the Sun, in which Deirdre tackled the sexual problems of members of the general public, which I was convinced had been made up by journalists in the next door office.</p> <p>\"My brother-in-law is my lover,\" he read out. \"Dear Deirdre, I am an attractive blonde and people say I have a good figure. The other night, when my husband was away, his brother came round and one thing led to another and we ended up in bed . . . \" He broke off from reading out the letter. \"They always say that: one thing led to another. How exactly does one thing lead to another, because that must be the bit that I'm getting wrong. I understand the brother coming round, and I understand that they were in bed together. But how did they get from the first stage to the last?\"</p> <p>\"It's easy, Simon,\" said Jim.</p> <p>\"Well, what? How do you do it?\"</p> <p>\"You meet a girl.\"</p> <p>\"Yes.\"</p> <p>\"She comes back for coffee.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, but then what?\"</p> <p>\"Well, one thing leads to another.\"</p> <p>After my second cup of tea I felt I'd finally run out of valid excuses for keeping the advertising agency waiting any longer, and so I collected the tape from my room and headed towards Balham tube station. Thirty minutes later I was walking down Berwick Street, where a couple of French students with a disposable camera nearly got run over trying to recreate the cover of What's the Story Morning Glory? I loved coming to Soho; it felt exciting and happening, and for a brief moment I liked to pretend I was part of it all. There were people here who earned a thousand pounds a day just for doing one voiceover for an advert, and then they'd blow it all by buying a prawn and avocado on focaccia with a caf\u00e9 latte to go. </p> <p>I glanced across the road and caught sight of Hugo from DD&amp;G, staring at a shop window. That's peculiar, I thought. Why is Hugo staring into the window of a wholesale Asian jewellery shop? Then he glanced up and down the road quickly and disappeared into a tatty open doorway under the glow of a dangerously wired red light. I was shocked. I approached the open doorway and looked in. The words \"New model. Very friendly. First floor\" were scrawled onto a piece of card that was stuck by the entrance with thick brown masking tape. I looked up the rickety uncarpeted stairs and wondered what lay beyond. Maybe Hugo was just going in to offer to improve their advertising, to suggest a professional copywriter who could produce a snappier slogan and spell \"friendly\" correctly. It seemed unlikely. I was part repulsed, part fascinated and strangely disappointed in Hugo, as if he had let me down personally.</p> <p>I continued up Berwick Street and finally entered the reception of the grand offices of DD&amp;G, where a certificate boasted that they were runners up for Best Investment and Banking Commercial at last year's Radio Advertising Awards. Apparently, Hugo had just popped out to get his wife a birthday card, so the tape was left with the beautiful waif of a receptionist, who sat in the window framed by lavish arrangements of fresh flowers.</p> <p>My work for the week was done. It was time to head for North London. In the rush hour I squeezed my way onto the tube with all the people who had spent the day at work. Hundreds of sweaty office workers pressing their bodies together and yet managing to give the impression that they were not the slightest bit aware that there was anyone else in the carriage. Arms bending into impossible angles to read paperbacks bent over at the spine. Necks craning to read someone else's newspaper. Christians re-reading the bible as if they didn't know it all by now. Suddenly a seat became available and I moved towards it as quickly as is possible without revealing that I was doing anything as undignified as hurrying. As I sat down I breathed out a satisfied sigh, but any relaxation soon flipped over into anxiety. A woman was standing right in front of me, and from under her dress protruded The Bulge Of Uncertainty. Was she six months pregnant or was she just a bit, well . . . fat? It was just impossible to say. I looked her up and down. Why can't she give me a sign? I thought. Why couldn't she be carrying a Mothercare bag or wearing one of those naff sweatshirts that say, \"Yes I am!\" I looked again. The dress hung loosely everywhere else; it was just on her rounded stomach that the material was stretched and taut. Which was worse, I wondered, denying a seat to a pregnant woman or offering a seat to a woman who wasn't pregnant but just looked as if she was. Maybe this is why men used to give up their seats to all women, to escape this embarrassing dilemma. No-one else seemed concerned, but I felt I had to do the decent thing.</p> <p>\"Sorry. Would you like to sit down?\" I said, getting up.</p> <p>\"Why would I want to sit down?\" she said aggressively.</p> <p>Shit, I thought. \"Erm . . . Well, you just looked a bit tired . . . um, and I'm getting off at the next stop anyway,\" I lied.</p> <p>On this understanding she took my seat, and I was forced to leave the carriage to maintain the deceit. I fought my way through the throng on the platform and rushed to get back on the train a couple of carriages further up. The not-pregnant woman had given me a very odd look, but it wasn't as strange as the one she gave me when we both went through the barriers at Kentish Town station fifteen minutes later.</p> <p>As I emerged back into the open air, my mobile phone signalled that I had a message. It was Hugo. He said he was sorry he'd missed me but that he had been in and out all afternoon, which was more detail than I needed. He was pleased with my piece of music and told me that I'd come up with something \"pretty bloody special\". Although I generally found Hugo very insincere and of poor judgement I was prepared to make an exception in this case. I never felt confident that the snippets of music I wrote were any good. Whenever a decent tune came into my head I couldn't believe that I hadn't just subconsciously stolen it from somewhere, so any form of praise was eagerly gobbled up. Sadly, the track was only for a pitch and the agency would probably never use Hugo's production company, so no-one would ever hear it. I had known this when I'd taken the job, but I knew I could do it quickly, it paid the bills and it meant I could afford to spend a couple of stress-free days in the cocoon I had created for myself.</p> <p>I turned into Bartholomew Close. Tall, monolithic grey wheelie bins lined the street, like Easter Island statues waiting impassively for strangers. I walked up to number 17 and put the key in the lock. As I opened the front door I was hit by the chaos and noise.</p> <p>\"Daddy!\" exclaimed my two-year-old daughter Millie with delight as she ran up the hallway and hugged my leg. There was a tape of children's nursery rhymes playing on the stereo and Alfie, my baby boy, was jiggling his limbs delightedly in his mother's arms.</p> <p>\"You're earlier than I expected,\" said Catherine with a smile. I tiptoed over some wooden bricks that were scattered on the carpet, gave her a kiss and then took Alfie from her.</p> <p>\"Yeah, and guess what? I've finished the job and won't have to work at all this weekend.\"</p> <p>\"Fantastic,\" she said. \"Then it's a double celebration. Because guess who wee'd in her potty today?\"</p> <p>\"Did you, Millie?\"</p> <p>Millie nodded with extraordinary pride, which was only surpassed by that of her mother.</p> <p>\"And you didn't get any on the floor, did you, Millie? Which is better than your daddy usually manages and he's thirty-two.\"</p> <p>I gave Catherine an affectionate poke in the ribs. \"Look, it's not my fault the toilet seat always falls down.\"</p> <p>\"No, it's that idiot who fitted it,\" she concurred, referring to the evening when it had taken me three hours to fit a new wooden toilet seat incorrectly.</p> <p>Millie had obviously enjoyed the praise that had been heaped upon her, so she quickly found another way to get some more attention. \"I done cat drawing,\" she said, presenting me with a scrap of paper, which I took from her and studied carefully. Frankly, Millie's drawing was rubbish. To represent our cat, she had taken the blue crayon and scribbled it up and down on a piece of paper.</p> <p>\"Ooh, Millie, that's a super picture. You are a clever girl.\" One day she would turn round and say, \"Don't patronize me, Father, we both know the picture is crap,\" but for the time being she seemed to buy it. I loved coming home when I hadn't seen them all for a couple of days; they were always so delighted to see me. It was the return of the prodigal father.</p> <p>Catherine grabbed the chance to start clearing up the kitchen as I played with the kids for a while. I played hide and seek with Millie, which was made easier by the fact that she hid in the same spot behind the curtains three times in a row. Then I made Alfie giggle by throwing him up in the air until Catherine came back into the room to see why he'd suddenly started crying.</p> <p>\"I don't know,\" I said, trying not to look up at the metal chandelier swinging back and forth above her head. She took the crying baby back, and at that moment I thought she looked a little tired, so I said I'd take over tidying up. I slipped upstairs, gathering scattered toys as I went. I ran a big foamy bath, turned off the light and lit a couple of candles. Then I placed the portable CD player in the bathroom and put on Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony.</p> <p>\"Catherine, can you just come upstairs a minute,\" I shouted. She came up and surveyed the instant sanctuary that I had created.</p> <p>\"I'll take over the kids and load the dishwasher and everything. You get in there and I'll bring you a glass of wine, and you're not allowed out till the end of the final movement, 'Shepherds Song; Beneficent Feelings After the Storm'.\"</p> <p>She leaned against me. \"Oh, Michael. What have I done to deserve this?\"</p> <p>\"Well, you've been looking after the kids on your own for a couple of days and you must need a bit of space.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, but you've been working hard, too. Don't you need a rest?\"</p> <p>\"I don't work as hard as you,\" I said sincerely. After a few half-hearted guilty protestations she clicked on the heated towel rail and turned up the volume loud enough to drown out the indignant shouts of \"Mummy!\" that had already started to emanate from the kitchen. \"Michael,\" she said as she kissed me on the cheek, \"thanks for being the best husband in the world.\" I smiled a half-smile. When your wife says something like that, it doesn't seem like the right moment to put her straight.</p>",
  "The furore over the Runnymede Trust's commission on the future of multi-ethnic Britain was vivid testimony to the continuing power of race to unsettle the nation. The mendacious account of the report by the Daily Telegraph, and subsequent selective and distorted quotations in an interview with one of the commissioners led to a feeding frenzy by the piranhas of Fleet Street, followed by hate-mail, hate-messages and death threats sent to the Runnymede Trust. <p>The report did not say that the UK should be redefined as a community of communities. It did not say that the word British should not be used to refer to the inhabitants of the UK. The report did not call for abolishing the terms \"Britain\" or \"British\". </p> <p>Most importantly of all, it did not say that the term British has racist connotations. \"Racial\" connotations yes, but \"racist\" no. Consider the difference between calling a group of, say, Chinese a \"racial\" group as opposed to a \"racist\" group. </p> <p>The word British - rather like Chinese - conjures up many images. And just as you or I would be unlikely to imagine a black or brown face when thinking of the word Chinese, so the images brought to mind with the word British are more likely to be of an Anglican church rather than a Sunni mosque, warm beer rather than a cold lassi, a white face rather than a black or brown one. </p> <p>It's changing, of course. But the meaning embedded in words often lags behind reality. The report was pointing this out and encouraging the process by which the word \"British\" could evoke a set of images that includes all the cultures and peoples who have made this country their home. </p> <p>Certain newspapers playing fast and loose with words is hardly a revelation. One predictable reason was the opportunity it provided to attack New Labour. An equally uninteresting and unimpressive reason was lazy journalism - unprepared to take the trouble to read the report and get the quotes right. </p> <p>What was so shocking was the way the Telegraph's interpretation was so readily and uncritically accepted. Even the Guardian's own headline \"British tag is 'coded racism'\" followed the herd rather than the text of the report. </p> <p>Read the report and be surprised. You might even take the view of the report that led to the headline \"Critics of a 'racist' Britain are misguided, says report\". The article began its story with the words: \"Race relations in Britain are the best in Europe - says Bhikhu Parekh author of the report.\" Where was this? Oh, in the Sunday Telegraph before its sister paper decided that truth could be a casualty in this war. </p> <p>At the heart of the many pieces written over the past week was a simple thought: we tolerate you - tolerance is one of the great British virtues, after all - but don't get above yourselves. And in particular don't dare to comment on, or seek to shape and alter this country's culture, values, future or history. Ah, history. </p> <p>When it is reported that we are seeking to \"rewrite\" British history, the very soul of Britain is being called into question. Words of extraordinary ferocity have been used: \"wicked\", \"what Stalin did\", \"a corrupting process\". This last phrase from a leader in the Mail asking how ministers could welcome a report that claims \"the Scots, Irish and Welsh have histories that are 'different' from the English story?\" Hello? Culloden? </p> <p>Those that came out last week, particularly those politicians who took the opportunity to proclaim their pride in being British and lent support to the attack on the Runnymede Trust and the report, should look into their souls and ask if they are happy to find themselves with those that seek to preserve a narrow definition of Britishness. </p> <p>The report does talk about \"re-imagining\" the national story. Rewriting of history is what historians do. Every generation of historians re-interprets the national story. Sometimes this is based on the unearthing of new primary sources, sometimes it reflects the new zeitgeist. Take the British empire. A hundred years ago the story of empire was the unfolding of liberty, as uncivilised nations were given the rule of law and democracy. The dominance of socialist ideology in the post-independence world led to the empire being seen as the story of rapacious exploitations through capitalism and imperialism. The Oxford History of the British Empire, based on new scholarship, suggests that the empire was as much a creation of the ruled as the rulers. </p> <p>A nation's story is continually being rewritten. This is only a threat to those who wish to preserve a certain myth, a certain story. What was happening for the past 10 days was the emergence of that voice in full cry: a last ditch defence of a Britain that is passing by. Slipping into history, one might almost say. </p> <p>\u0095 Samir Shah chairs the Runnymede Trust.

  "The government has made little progress in reducing truancy, David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, admitted yesterday. <p>The main obstacle was parents who condoned and even encouraged their children's unauthorised absence from school, he said. </p> <p>Despite tougher penalties for parents, truancy rates have remained high since Labour came to power, with 50,000 children skipping school every day in England. </p> <p>With Jack Straw, the home secretary, Mr Blunkett yesterday announced a renewed national crackdown involving police, schools and local authorities, backed by \u00a343m of extra funding and more powers for the courts. </p> <p>The Department for Education and Employment and the Home Office are joining forces to hit the government's target to cut unauthorised absence by a third by 2002. </p> <p>Regular \"truancy sweeps\", or random visits by police and local authorities, have shown that many children out of school without permission are accompanied by their parents. Every local authority is being ordered to carry out more sweeps - in which truants are rounded up and returned to school - while schools are encouraged to use the extra money available to employ learning mentors or attendance officers. </p> <p>\"We have made progress in reducing the number of excluded children, but we have made very little progress in terms of persistent truancy,\" Mr Blunkett said on a visit to Quintin Kynaston school in St John's Wood, north-west London. He blamed parents who had \"a contempt for education _ and who are frightened that it is separating them from their children\". </p> <p>Legislation now before parliament will increase maximum fines on parents from \u00a31,000 to \u00a32,000, while parents face arrest if they do not turn up in court. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett hailed the action being taken by the head at Quintin Kynaston school, once a popular comprehensive which later ran into difficulties. Attendance rates have risen from 87% to 90% in the past five years. </p> <p>Mr Straw pointed to the clear links between truancy and crime, with 72% of truants found in one survey to have committed at least one offence. \"I have never met a young offender who hasn't been involved in regular truanting,\" he said. </p> <p>Theresa May, the shadow education secretary, said: \"While I welcome moves to encourage more involvement from the police to get children back to school, I fear that simply increasing fines for parents whose children fail to attend will not work. </p> <p>\"How much faith can parents have in a government which penalises the parents rather than addressing the core problems of why their children are persistently truanting?\" </p> <p>The announcement drew a mixed reaction from teacher unions. The National Association of Head Teachers welcomed the extra funding to tackle truancy. Its president, Mick Brookes, said the union \"urges the government to take a very firm line on parents who condone unnecessary absence, because in the early years this sets a pattern and an expectation in pupils that school does not matter\". </p> <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers warned: \"The government needs to do a lot more than simply rounding up the rogues and frog-marching them back to school. Increasing powers of the courts to fine largely dysfunctional parents for conniving with their children's truancy makes good headlines but does precious little to impact seriously upon the problem.\" </p> <p>The Professional Association of Teachers said: \"The government must tackle the social and family problems that are often the root cause.\" </p> <p><b>'Have to buy hamster' a top excuse</b></p> <p>\u0095In Sheffield, where David Blunkett has his constituency, sweeps of the city centre found the majority of children not at school were of primary school age and accompanied by parents. Three-quarters of the reasons proffered for not being at school were classed as unauthorised absence, the three most common being sunburn, hayfever, and buying a hamster. </p> <p>\u0095A sweep near Kempton Park racecourse in Surrey on a weekday morning identified 99 children who should have been at school - 81 accompanied by one or more parents. </p> <p>\u0095In Newham, east London, police officers have embarked on truancy sweeps riding mountain bikes as well as in cars and vans. During sweeps in the north of the borough, car crime fell by 70%; while during sweeps in the south street crime fell by 17%, burglary by 39%, car crime by 37% and robberies by 25%. </p> <p>\u0095In York sweeps take place up to five times a month. More than one in two truanting children is found to be accompanied by a parent. Youth crime has decreased by 67% since the regular sweeps were publicised.</p> <p>\u0095In London 10- to 16-year-olds are responsible for 40% of street robberies, 25% of burglaries, 20% of criminal damage, and 33% of car thefts.</p>",

  "The background to Scottish Labour's convulsions after Donald Dewar's death is the fact the Labour party no longer has sole control of executive government in Edinburgh or Cardiff, where a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition is being formed. <p>Looked at from London, this must look worrying. The personal contacts and friendships that would help ensure that devolution did not bring about dangerous division are no longer reliably in place. But viewed from Edinburgh and Cardiff, the picture looks very different. </p> <p>Labour may have introduced devolution but it has had difficulty profiting from it. The party performed poorly in the first devolution elections. In Scotland its 34% share of the party list vote was lower than in any Westminster election since 1931. In Wales, its 35% share broke records as far back as 1918. </p> <p>This was not some mid-term protest reaction to the performance and policies of the Blair government. In both Scotland and Wales more people thought things had improved since Labour had come to power than thought they had got worse, at least as far as living standards, education and unemployment were concerned. Whatever people thought of the record of the government seemed to make little difference to whether or not they remained loyal to Labour in their new national elections. </p> <p>Labour's difficulties lay elsewhere. People who were still willing to vote Labour for Westminster proved reluctant to back the party when it came to the Scottish or Welsh contests. Many opted for the nationalists instead. </p> <p>In Scotland, Labour's share of the vote was no less than 9% adrift of what it would have secured in a Westminster election. In Wales, the equivalent figure was as much as 13%. Without this devolution gap Labour would have done pretty much as well as it had in 1997. There would be no need of a coalition in Wales and maybe not even in Scotland. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the nationalists rode high. In Scotland they were 7% better off than they would have been in a Westminster byelection. In Wales they were no less than 17% ahead. Without the devolution gap, the \"quiet earthquake\" experienced in last year's Welsh election would not have registered on the Richter scale at all. </p> <p>Nothing that Labour has done in the first year of devo lution has closed the devolution gap. For example, the most recent Scottish poll puts Labour and the Scottish National party (SNP) even stevens when it came to people's intentions on voting for the House of Commons, but no less than 14% behind in the race for the Scottish parliament. </p> <p>So what accounts for the devolution gap? Why did voters who would not consider voting nationalist in a Westminster election do so when it came to the devolved elections? </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, perhaps, many voters in Scotland and Wales are doubtful about how far London looks after them. In both countries no more than one in three believes that the UK government works in their country's best long-term interests \"just about always\" or \"most of the time\". So when invited to elect a parliament for Scotland and an assembly for Wales, many were looking for a party that would use the new institutions to redress the balance. </p> <p>Many doubted Labour fitted the bill. Just 40% of people in Scotland trust Labour to look after their interests. In Wales, the equivalent figure is 44%. In contrast 68% in Scotland trust the SNP to look after Scots' interests and in Wales 82% say the same of Plaid Cymru. </p> <p>And it was these perceptions that brought new votes into the nationalist camp. Our research looked at those who said they would not have voted nationalist in a Westminster election who actually did so in last year's devolved election, broken down by the level of trust they had in the ability of various institutions to advance Scottish/Welsh interests. We found voters who were distrustful of the UK government in general and of New Labour in particular were more likely to switch to the nationalists. In Scotland, it was the former perception that was the more important while in Wales it was the latter - a reflection, perhaps, of the particular opprobrium Labour heaped upon itself by attempting to block Rhodri Morgan's progress towards leadership of the Welsh assembly. Voters were even more likely to switch if at the same time they trusted the SNP or Plaid Cymru (as most of them did). </p> <p>The Scottish and Welsh Labour parties themselves were unable to escape from the long shadow cast by New Labour at Westminster. Voters did take a more charitable view when they were asked whether Scottish or Welsh Labour looked after the interests of people in their country. As the chart shows, substantially more trusted their national Labour parties over Labour at large. </p> <p>But these perceptions were unable to stem the tide to the nationalists, which proved equally strong among those who trusted the Scottish or Welsh Labour parties as among those who did not. </p> <p>The lesson for Labour in both Scotland and Wales is clear. Voters want those running their new institutions to advance their interests. If they are not to conclude that only the nationalists will do so, then Labour needs to show it can do things differently in Scotland and Wales than in London. Preserving the United Kingdom's unions means allowing the devolution child to grow up, not keeping it tied to its umbilical cord. </p> <p> John Curtice is deputy director of the Economic and Social Research Council's Centre for research into elections and social trends. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:J.Curtice@strath.ac.uk\">J.Curtice@strath.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<b>What is the scare about?</b> <br> An oral polio vaccine, Medeva, has been recalled amid fears over CJD, the human form of BSE or \"mad cow disease\". Medeva is partly made up of bovine materials from the UK, where there have been cases of BSE. The fear is the vaccine may include BSE contaminated traces. The guidelines that should ensure suspect medicines are prohibited have been breached, and the discovery of this fact by the Medical Controls Agency has triggered today's recall. <p><b>What are the risks of this vaccine giving someone CJD?</b><br> \"Incalculably small\" according to the Department of Health, which insists that the recall is a precautionary one and that the vaccine was due for replacement anyway. The vaccine contains tiny traces of a foetal calf growth serum, but this is classified under the European guidelines as in category IV, which stands for \"no detectable ineffectively\". Also, the manufacturing processes used to make the vaccine are designed to remove the serum. The Department of Health stress that it is balance of these points which makes them confident it is unlikely anyone will contract BSE from the vaccine.</p> <p><b>How widely is Medeva used? </b><br> It has been given to hundreds of thousands of patients, usually on sugar cubes, to children or travellers. The vaccine has been used since the early 1980s and, up until this September, accounted for a third of all polio inoculations. Alternatives are available and supplies by Smith Kline Beecham are being increased with haste.</p> <p><b>How has this happened? </b><br> It is not yet clear exactly how the vaccine has remained in use, but the government have said that assurances were repeatedly \"sought and received\" from Medeva that they were implementing new guidelines on bovine materials that came into force last year. The Department of Health, whose suspicions were raised in June, have said that they now know these assurances were inaccurate. Medeva today said they were preparing a statement on the recall. </p> <p><b>What is the advice for people who are concerned?</b><br> GPs are being advised by the Department of Health on the scare, and the NHS Direct call line (0845 4647) can answer specific anxieties. The government have told doctors that immunisation programmes should continue with alternative vaccines. If you or your child have had a Medeva vaccination, there is no urgent need to have any kind of check up, as the current advice is that there is such a tiny risk of contracting BSE.</p> <p><b>Are there other concerns? </b><br> The fears of the British Polio Fellowship are that the scare might deter people from being vaccinated. In a statement, the fellowship said that there was still a \"real risk\" of polio and cited a case in Holland a few years ago where a religious community decided against vaccinations and there was an epidemic. They also called for more stringent monitoring processes on BSE risks.</p>",
  "The government's advisers on BSE risked starting a new row with France yesterday when they suggested British beef was now safer than that in other European countries and that tourists should be told of potential risks of catching the human form of the disease from infected cows abroad. <p>Harriet Kimbell, the consumer representative on a committee made up mostly of scientists, said she had made a personal decision not to let her family eat French beef or beef products on holiday, but ministers should stop short of telling other people to follow suit. </p> <p>\"I would like information in the public domain so people can make their own choices,\" she said. \"People should be made aware of countries where BSE is increasing. </p> <p>\"I would not have the British government saying, 'Don't eat beef in France.' I made up my mind for my family. I would not dream of telling everyone else what to do for their particular families.\" </p> <p>Mrs Kimbell, who lectures at the College of Law, Guildford, and is deputy chairwoman of the Consumers' Association, said she had stopped her sons, Andrew, 17, and Ben, 14, eating beef when on holiday in the French Alps last year. She had taken them round the buffet in the dining room at the centre where they were staying and \"told them what to eat and what not to eat\". </p> <p>Tourists and other Britons travelling abroad should, she said, \"be made aware that it may well be British beef is safer than beef in some European countries, and then they can make up their own mind if they want to incur the risk of eating beef elsewhere\". </p> <p>Peter Smith, acting chairman of the spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee, said he \"did not feel uncomfortable\" eating British beef, although animals in other countries might be going into the food chain further into the BSE incubationperiod. There was a \"cogent case\" that British beef might now be safer than that in other countries even if the size of their epidemics was far smaller, he added. </p> <p>The committee has asked the food standards agency to review checks that beef from cattle infected with the disease, but not showing outward signs, is not slipping into Britain illegally. All European countries are now required to ban parts of cattle thought to be most at risk of spreading BSE infection to humans, but in addition Britain bans all animals more than 30 months old, including imports from countries with BSE. </p> <p>The food agency said there were no grounds to advise against consumption of legally sold EU beef, while a source at the French agriculture ministry said people were entitled to their point of view. </p> <p>He added: \"We do not pretend that our preventative measures against BSE are perfect and we are ceaselessly improving them in consul tation with our scientists.\" </p> <p>France, which has refused to lift its ban on British beef and has reported more than 150 cases of BSE in all - including 71 so far this year - exports nearly 5,000 tonnes a year to the UK. Ireland, where there have been 500 BSE cases, is Britain's biggest supplier, sending 77,000 tonnes annually. Other countries with BSE include Portugal, where there have been 452 cases, and Switzerland, where there have been 359 cases. </p> <p>Despite the decline in the BSE epidemic in Britain, there have already been 962 cases this year, bringing the total to 177,314. Many thousands of infected animals are thought to have entered the food chain during the late 1980s before the first BSE controls were introduced. </p> <p>Last year Britain still had 472 BSE cases for every million cattle more than 24 months old. France had 2.8 for every million. </p> <p>Most animals struck down by BSE are far older than 30 months and scientists in the UK now believe that only one British cow a year over 30 months, and likely to display BSE if not killed, is slipping through the net. </p> <p>The advisory committee has also recommended new experiments to ensure pigs and poultry cannot carry \"hidden BSE\" and infect people eating their meat. Tests in the early 1990s suggested this was not possible but new research using mice and hamsters injected with a BSE-like disease has reawakened fears.</p>",
  "Today's shocking revelation that a common polio vaccine grown using material from British cows has been in use since early in the BSE crisis should perhaps not really be so surprising. <p> The history of incompetence in identifying and managing risk, and a tendency to cohabit with the beef industry rather than with consumers displayed by agriculture and health officials during the crisis, has been glaringly exposed during the two year BSE inquiry whose report is published next week.</p> <p> The possibility of people catching a human form of the incurable cattle condition from medicines was identified by some advisers as early as autumn 1987 but the then chief medical officer and his ministers were not informed even of the disease until March 1988. </p> <p> Since 1989 there has been a succession of guidelines from Whitehall and, later, Brussels on sourcing material, usually calf serum for growing vaccines, from countries which have no history of BSE. But only in March next year will these have the full force of law. </p> <p>More surprisingly, EU guidelines have explicitly covered oral vaccines - as well as injected alternatives - only since 1999. Nevertheless, the spirit of the guidance was always meant to cover all types. </p> <p>It has been taken largely on trust that the medicines industry follows such guidance. Until very recently, it hid behind confidentiality clauses when journalists or the public tried to find out how many products still used British-sourced cattle products. The health department has always argued that scares about vaccine safety would be more dangerous than what it first called the \"theoretical\", and more recently \"remote\", risk of BSE infection, as huge numbers of parents might stop inoculating their children. It therefore allowed stocks of vaccines using British bovine sources to be used well into the 1990s without even telling the public about the concerns.</p> <p> But its pathetic excuse over the Medeva polio vaccine - that \"the assurances by the company have proven inaccurate\" - shows just how poor the regulation of drugs really is.

  "<p>The potential of pay-per-view television as a cash cow for British football clubs and broadcasters has been under discussion since Rupert Murdoch first introduced Sky TV and pay-television more than a decade ago. </p> <p>NTL's decision to pull out of a \u00a3328m, three-year deal to show 40 pay-per-view Premiership football games each season, citing \"commercial reasons\", has led to a dramatic revision of that premise. </p> <p>The cable television company's withdrawal came as no surprise to some City analysts. </p> <p>From the moment the price of the deal was announced many questioned how the Nasdaq-listed operator would make it pay. </p> <p>The calculations suggested that NTL needed to recoup \u00a32.7m per match. At \u00a34 per punter per match this meant a regular paying audience of 675,000. </p> <p>Experience shows that these figures are hugely ambitious. The record pay-per-view subscriber number for BSkyB, with more subscribers than NTL, was around 600,000 - for a boxing match between Frank Bruno and Mike Tyson. </p> <p>Two years ago, when the satellite broadcaster offered a Sunderland versus Oxford game as a pay-per-view event, only tens of thousands paid to watch. The north-east club said it made \u00a330,000 at most. </p> <p><strong> Glamorous games</strong><br> </p> <p> NTL would have opted to show the more exciting games but its hands are tied under the terms of its agreement with BSkyB, who, as the holder of the main rights, has first choice. </p> <p>The latter would have undoubtedly broadcast the plum tie each week. </p> <p>\"This was the most enormous escape for NTL because the maths never made sense,\" said one well-known media analyst. </p> <p>NTL believes it could have made the deal pay by using pay-per-view rights as a way to tempt customers away from BSkyB. </p> <p>The company thought it could entice 500,000 BSkyB subscribers - with cable facilities outside their front door - away from Mr Murdoch by offering an attractive deal including a telephone, a pay TV, an internet package and a pay-per-view season ticket valued at \u00a3100 for free. </p> <p>The cable company believed it would cover its \u00a3328m outlay with money from these new customers, and a further 500,000 football-crazy and rich BSkyB customers, who would be happy to add a \u00a3100 season ticket to their existing package. This was not to be, as NTL found. </p> <p>The club chairmen balked at the proposal, saying they would not have their \"premier content\" given away seemingly for free, for fear of devaluing it. </p> <p>Some analysts believe that the NTL figures could have worked. </p> <p>They admit, however, that the strategy was risky and flawed. It failed, for example, to allow for any competitive response from BSkyB. </p> <p>The only way the pay-per-view scheme can succeed is by boosting viewers' figures. It has to be made available to the maximum amount of pay TV homes as possible, according to the analysts. </p> <p>Perhaps NTL had hoped for a more rapid expansion of digital cable television. Unfortunately this has not taken place. At the same time it has not been allowed to forget that BSkyB has 4m digital homes. The Premiership's insistence that NTL make its pay-per-view games avail able to BSkyB subscribers has knocked back its negotiating position. </p> <p>The clubs, as the rights' holders, now have to decide whether they want to resurrect the deal or start new negotiations. NTL and OnDigital are both thought to be prepared to offer shorter term deals but at a lower price. </p> <p>Continental broadcasters with pay-per-view experience, including Canal Plus, Kirch and Stream, could also enter the fray. US players can also not be discounted. </p> <p>Then there is BSkyB. The Premiership's own rules currently prevent the satellite broadcaster from bidding. Those rules were devised to extract maximum value from the rights' sale, and to ensure that no one party gained too much control over football. </p> <p><strong> Strong ties</strong><br> </p> <p> But BSkyB could now be allowed to bid as the two parties have developed a strong relationship since first becoming broadcast partners eight years ago. In addition Sky Sports could offer cross-promotional advantages. </p> <p>Friends of Vic Wakeling, BSkyB's head of sports, say he greeted the collapse of the NTL deal with a \"huge grin\", and his employer's steadfast refusal to comment on any possible bid suggests something may be afoot. </p> <p>Yet there is also a growing feeling that the Premier League could set up its own channel to maximise value from its rights. With no experience of broadcasting the league may need to partner with a media company. </p> <p>It could even acquire the relevant production skills to go it alone in time for the next round of rights' negotiations in three years' time. The strategy was first suggested to the Premiership more than a year ago by former BSkyB bosses Sam Chisholm and David Chance, advisers to the clubs at the time. </p> <p>Hanging over any pay-per-view proposal will be the fear that the public's obsession with football has reached saturation point. </p> <p>BSkyB's own football viewing figures are declining and it is unclear how regularly fans would have signed up for extra matches on an individual basis.</p>",
  "Israeli troops last night staged a desperate operation to rescue wounded settlers trapped in a five-hour firefight with Palestinian gunmen that further undermined hopes for a swift end to the violence. Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, said the confrontation was a \"grave breach\" of a precarious ceasefire brokered only 48 hours earlier, according to a statement from his office. <p>As two attack helicopters provided covering machine-gun fire, troops struggled to extricate six wounded Jewish settlers from Mount Ebal, north-west of the West Bank city of Nablus. At least one settler and one Palestinian gunman were reported to have been killed. Two other Jewish settlers were critically injured. </p> <p>The gunfire erupted after the settlers allegedly opened fire on olive harvesters, killing one man and injuring 11 others. It was the second attack on olive harvesters this week. </p> <p>By nightfall, scores of armed men from the Nablus area, including men in the uniform of Palestinian security forces, were clambering up the steep rocky hill. Several opened fire on the helicopters. The settlers, in a group of about 36, had visited the hilltop hoping for a view of a tomb compound in the centre of the city that had been desecrated. </p> <p>As the pictures were broadcast live on Israeli television, the trapped settlers, who included elderly people and children, gave interviews on mobile phones. </p> <p>\"Under fire for five hours straight,\" Elazar Mizrahi told Channel Two television against a background of automatic fire. \"There are still gunshots.

I can't leave here.\" </p> <p>Israeli radio stations broadcast warnings in Arabic for people in the neighbouring Askar refugee camp, at the foot of the hill, to leave their homes before punitive action was taken. </p> <p>Scores of religious Jewish settlers gathered by the roadside to pray beside the 30 who had been rescued earlier. </p> <p>Yesterday's confrontation was the most serious for a week, and punctures hopes that Israel and the Palestinians can ease tensions within 48 hours, a deadline set on Tuesday. </p> <p>The head of Israel's central command, General Yitzhak Eitan, said members of the tanzim, the militia raised by Mr Arafat's Fatah organisation, were among the gunmen on the mountain, deepening Israeli suspicions that he does not truly want an end to the violence, or that he is losing control on the ground. </p> <p>Last night, there was ferocious criticism of the settlers' decision to visit the area, which many Israelis viewed as a deliberate provocation. Gen Eitan admitted the army had approved the visit, but he said it was unclear why permission had been granted. </p> <p>The gun battle is certain to further inflame rightwing Likud party leaders who have been calling for the army to crack down even harder on Palestinians, after three weeks of bloody mayhem left more than 100 dead. </p> <p>Elsewhere yesterday, two Palestinian policemen were killed in an explosion at Bethlehem's main police station. Israeli officials said a bomb they were assembling blew up. </p> <p>To the north of the Gaza Strip, Palestinian stone throwers clashed with Israeli soldiers, who fired teargas grenades. </p> <p>There were also skirmishes in the West Bank city of Hebron after Palestinians found graffiti insulting the prophet Mohammed on walls near a Jewish enclave. </p> <p>Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian minister, in Cairo preparing for tomorrow's summit,said: \"Israel wants to kill the Pales tinian people and to keep them under siege, and to put them under pressure that they cannot bear.\" </p> <p>As part of the ceasefire plan, Israel lifted the internal closure on Palestinian areas on Wednesday, and yesterday transported tanks out of the Ramallah area. But it has yet to lift a closure between Israel and the Palestinian areas, barring 110,000 Palestinians from their jobs and the Palestinian economy from its principal sustenance.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "No-one has high hopes of a permanent ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinians. But if any outside party can help it is probably the CIA, working closely with the security chiefs on both sides to try to ensure cooperation. <p>George Tenet, the intelligence agency's director, played a key role at Tuesday's Sharm el-Sheikh summit, though he issued no statements and did not appear in public. </p> <p>Mr Tenet, happiest in the shadows, was yesterday reported to be furious after a secret security annex - the only real achievement of the emergency talks in Egypt - was leaked by the Israelis, even as the Palestinians denied its existence. </p> <p>But he quickly followed up summit pledges by browbeating the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, into issuing a more strongly worded declaration calling for an end to violence after Israel considered his previous effort insufficient. </p> <p>Yet even the CIA will find it hard to rebuild confidence between the two sides after the deaths of more than 90 Palestinians in clashes with Israel in the last three weeks. </p> <p>Israel is angry that Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists released by Mr Arafat's men are still at large. A deadly and highly professional bomb used in an ambush in Gaza on Wednesday night was blamed on Islamist groups. </p> <p>In Sharm el-Sheikh, Mr Tenet was joined by Col Jibril Rajoub, the head of Palestinian preventative security in the West Bank, and by Avi Dichter, of Israel's Shin Bet internal security service. </p> <p>For more than two years now, Mr Tenet's men, led by the Tel Aviv CIA station chief, Jeff O'Connor, have been working behind the scenes to keep these volatile former enemies on reasonable terms. </p> <p>CIA officers take part in routine meetings between the two sides in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, serving as notetakers and submitting reports for their approval afterwards. </p> <p>Last week the Israelis took a CIA man up to Psagot, an isolated Jewish settlement in the Ramallah area, to prove that the other side had started shooting. \"Luckily the Palestinians opened fire first,\" said one Israeli. </p> <p>Relations between Col Rajoub, his Gaza counterpart Muhammad Dahlan and their Israeli opposite numbers have been cool to non-existent since the trouble began last month. \"I don't believe that relations can go back to the same level of intimacy as before,\" said a senior Israeli official. </p> <p>Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, made no secret of his dislike for the spy agency's role in the past. Israelis say the involvement of the CIA has always been more important for the Palestinians than for them because it keeps channels of communication open when things are bad officially. \"For us, frankly, its a pain in the arse,\" said an Israeli expert. \"When this all started, the CIA guys were like a referee who could blow the whistle and send people off if there was a foul. Now we don't even want them on the pitch.\" </p> <p>Cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian \"spooks\" has always been central to making the 1993 Oslo agreement work. But when trust broke down it was clear there would have to be a third party involved. </p> <p>After Oslo, the CIA began to train Palestinians in intelligence-gathering, interrogation and tracking the funds of terrorist organisations - all part of an effort to make the former PLO apparatus less thuggish and accountable. </p> <p>But the US agency's role as security go-between grew after the Israeli-Palestinian accord at Wye River in 1998. \"Being able to have someone to talk to who can talk to the other side and move into the area of the other side quietly and effectively... gets around the kind of conspiracy theories and blame that are prevalent in this area,\" said Anthony Cordesman, of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"What both sides need is someone that can act as a discreet, professional referee. The agency has done this.\" </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "The battle to become the first minister of Scotland started yesterday, just a day after Donald Dewar's funeral, as two Scottish cabinet ministers declared their intention to stand. <p>The contest will be as brief as it has come swiftly: the finance minister, Jack McConnell, and the enterprise minister, Henry McLeish, have until tomorrow to garner support for their campaigns. </p> <p>In a controversial move, Labour has put its usual election rules to one side and set up a fast-track procedure to elect an interim leader on Saturday. The winner will be nominated as first minister. </p> <p>Under the terms of the Scotland Act, a new first minister must be in place by November 7. Labour says its usual electoral college system - comprising MSPs, unions and the party's executive - cannot provide a candidate in time. </p> <p>The party intends to follow up tomorrow's vote with a full election later in the year. But it is understood that whoever wins a majority from the 54 MSPs and 27 executive members who will vote in Stirling this weekend will stand unopposed in the full election. </p> <p>The move has led to backbench claims that Labour is trying to bypass democracy. </p> <p>The Scottish National party leader, John Swinney, said: \"Labour's apparatchiks are dodging a real leadership con test and cutting their ordinary members out of the process.\" </p> <p>In the days after Mr Dewar's death, supporters of Mr McLeish, 52, launched a campaign to have him appointed without opposition. The move played badly with backbench MSPs and Mr McConnell, 40, has refused not to stand. </p> <p>Mr McLeish, the MSP for Fife Central, is the favourite to win tomorrow's vote. Supporters claim he has the backing of every Scottish cabinet minister and many of their deputies. </p> <p>The swift contest may, however, benefit Mr McConnell, MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw. Some backbenchers are annoyed at what they see as an attempt to deny them a vote. Mr McConnell is also said to have less support among the full electoral college than Mr McLeish. </p> <p>Mr McLeish, a former professional footballer, helped Mr Dewar steer through Westminster the legislation which created the Scottish parliament. He is the most experienced minister and has a long-held desire to be first minister. </p> <p>He is believed to be the favoured choice of the chancellor, Gordon Brown, but a perceived reticence to enter political tussles when things are going wrong for Labour may play badly for him among the backbenchers. </p> <p>Launching his campaign, he said: \"This is a time when unity, experienced leadership and solidity of purpose will be needed most of all.\" </p> <p>Mr McConnell is a former general secretary of the Scottish Labour party, but is relatively untested as a minister. </p> <p>His supporters say he is a talented backroom fixer and he might take the Scottish party on a more radical path than Mr McLeish.</p>",

  "<p>The London Stock Exchange is to move out of its landmark tower and seek a full listing if it is successful in fending off the hostile \u00a31bn bid from Sweden's OM Gruppen. </p> <p>It will also build a pan-European stock market, expand its product range and establish a broker services group for the retail community. </p> <p>The plans, contained in its third defence document which was published yesterday, came as shareholders voted against abandoning a crucial ownership limit. This could further impede OM's approach. </p> <p>The decision to keep the 4.9% shareholding limit, supported by 53.3% of voters, means any bidder would need the support of 75% of shareholders to succeed. </p> <p>The exchange's defence was further strengthened by the publication of interim results that showed operating profit before exceptional items up 89% to \u00a329.1m on the back of \u00a390.6m turnover. </p> <p>These figures, covering the first-half period following demutualisation in March, have resulted in an interim dividend of 10p per share. </p> <p>Don Cruickshank, exchange chairman, told shareholders his main aim was \"seeing off\" the OM offer and building the business. </p> <p>This will include the already stated plans to reposition Techmark, the technology-based index, and AIM as international markets. </p> <p>\"We have here a thriving business with a world class brand and reputation,\" he said. </p> <p>The bid from OM raised numerous questions about ownership and control, and offered \"no proven benefits\" to shareholders. </p> <p>But OM last night insisted it was pressing ahead with its cash and paper bid and branded the shareholders' decision \"a technicality\". </p> <p>Per Larsson, OM's chief executive, believes the narrowness of the vote actually strengthens its hand. </p> <p>\"There are probably people at the LSE scratching their heads and saying this is not the ringing endorsement they were hoping for,\" he was reported as saying. \"There is a split on the way forward for the LSE.\" </p> <p>At the time of demutualisation, the LSE board decided the time was not right to move to a full listing, but yesterday predicted such a move will eventually happen. </p> <p>\"The board envisages moving to a full listing in due course and will keep the timing of any such move under review,\" Mr Cruickshank said. </p> <p>Plans for the pan-European market would involve the London exchange extending its arrangements with the London Clearing House and British settler Crest. </p> <p>The LSE's decision to leave Exchange Tower by 2004 at the latest follows the reduction in staff numbers due to waves of cost cutting. </p> <p>The market value for redevelopment of the tower is believed to be up to \u00a3110m, although this is likely to be subject to a mortgage debenture stock of around \u00a349m. </p> <p>The exchange's board expects its home to remain in the heart of London.</p>",
  "Extortion, drug smuggling, gun running and murder were not advertised on the campus syllabus, but that is exactly what Sicily's University of Messina was teaching, Italian police said yesterday. <p>Thirty people were arrested and seven went on the run after a 16-year investigation climaxed on Wednesday in dawn swoops on the campus, situated on the eastern tip of Sicily. Local politicians and prosecutors were implicated in the alleged corruption, which turned lethal after a professor tried to speak out.</p> <p>Administrators and academics at the university allegedly teamed up with the mafia to build a vast criminal empire, initially funded by the bribes that students paid to pass exams. Some of the brighter students also paid thugs to terrorise academics into falsely awarding degrees.</p> <p>Authorities believe the scam started in 1984 with modest bribes to professors to pass exams, but it soon grew. The price for a bachelor's degree in statistics, economics and commerce became \u00a32,500; for immunology and medical degrees it was \u00a33,100.</p> <p>The 'Ndrangheta mafia clan, usually based on the toe of Italy, muscled in even though Messina nominally falls under the control of its Sicilian colleagues, the Cosa Nostra.</p> <p>Led by Giuseppe Morabito, whose nickname is Straight Ahead, the clan showed staff how to expand the scam to invest the money in drugs, some of them stolen from the university's pharmacological labs.</p> <p>The breakthrough came in 1998, with the murder of Professor Amadeo Bottari, possibly because he had threatened to blow the whistle. Prof Bottari's colleague, Giuseppe Longo, was arrested the following year as the network's alleged circle of protectors began to crumble.</p> <p>Angelo Giorgianni, a former Messina prosecutor, was forced to resign as interior under-secretary amid suspicion of collusion.</p> <p>\"We uncovered a criminal ring headed by Longo, which was connected to the mafia and exercised a huge power on the university's management,\" said Messina prosecutor Luigi Croce. \"The ring basically had a three-pronged organisation which bribed professors, some of whom took an active part in managing the ring, controlled the university's administration and managed the local drug trade.\"</p> <p>Giovanni Lumia, head of parliament's anti-mafia commission, said other arrests might follow.</p> <p>\"We have to keep working to uncover the connections between the mafia and the local entrepreneurs and notables,\" he said.</p> <p>Seventy-nine people are under investigation.</p>",
  "When the young Walter Lippmann, later to become the foremost advocate of American engagement in the world, travelled to Europe in June 1914, he had not even the faintest notion that a terrible war was imminent. \"It was possible,\" he wrote, \"for an American in those days to be totally unconscious of the world he lived in.\" He dallied in the Lake District for a while, then crossed to Belgium, planning to go on through Germany to Switzerland for a walking holiday. He remembered \"being rather annoyed when I went into the railway station and found that the German border was closed because Belgium had had an ultimatum.\" <p>Lippmann recorded this anecdote in a book he wrote in 1943 arguing that the United States could no longer operate as if it was a country separate and aloof from all others, that it had a stake in world order, and that it had to respect what order existed. The tenaciousness of the American sense of separateness can be seen in the fact that the issues which Lippmann raised are, in not too different form, the same ones which face Americans today. The blissful ignorance of the world which he sketched is gone. If there is ignorance now it is wilful rather than blissful. But America still acts internationally according to its own rules and accepts only partially and reluctantly rules made by others. This tendency, now more often and more accurately called unilateralism rather than isolation ism, was in abeyance during the years when the US marshalled a network of alliances against the communist states. Even then, some argue, the appearance of collective decision making was usually misleading. In any case, once the Russian and Chinese enemies had disappeared, the US rapidly regressed, spurning treaties over which other nations had long laboured, misbehaving in international organisations, and acting with others usually only in ad hoc alliances of which it was the main organiser. And all this was under a president, Bill Clinton, who began in office committed to the UN, to international law, and to multilateralism in all spheres. </p> <p>The difference between Americans and others can be illustrated by the case of the Statute of Rome, which sets up an international criminal court. The Americans, it is well known, did not like the idea that their servicemen might face charges in such a court, but their deeper objection was constitutional. The US constitution would not permit the actions which an American government might have to take under the statute. France and Germany had similar constitutional difficulties. Both chose to change their constitutions. But, in the words of one American opponent of the statute, writing in an illuminating recent publication from the Royal Institute of International Affairs, \"The US ... is not going to amend its constitution to accommodate the latest international fad ... the US shall stand by its old ways which have served it well for over 200 years.\" There is surely no clearer case of ancestor worship in the western world than this. </p> <p>A partial accounting of American delinquency during the Clinton years includes the failure to pay its full UN dues, the refusal, since Somalia, to place American troops under direct UN command, the refusal to sign the landmines treaty, the refusal to sign the Statute of Rome, the refusal to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty, and the pursuit of a national missile defence scheme which, if realised, would almost certainly undermine most of the existing arms limitation agreements with Russia. While refusing to be bound by rules agreed on by large groups of nations, the US has meanwhile come up with sanctions against some 60 countries which have offended it in one way or another. The Congress, it appears, believes it has a right to legislate for the world, but the world has no right to legislate for the US. </p> <p>It cannot be simply said that in choosing between Gore and Bush, the American people are choosing between an internationalist and a unilateralist road. Clinton has already been forced into serious compromises, with which Gore is associated and, if he is elected, he too would have to contend with a legislature in which unilateralism is entrenched. Bush is not absolutely shackled to the unilateralist idea and, in office, realism would no doubt often prevail. The difference is rather that Gore would fight the unilateralist tendency, while Bush would be inclined to go along with it. </p> <p>The second debate between the candidates, on foreign policy, showed both men tiptoeing around the charged question of \"humanitarian\" military intervention. In a strange way this has become for many Americans the most important international issue. In spite of the fact that the US has committed its forces to such interventions very much on its own terms and conditions, the notion persists there, or at least is assiduously cultivated for political reasons, that America has been forced into these onerous tasks by an international community which is at the same time demanding and ungrateful. The concentration on the military question also obscures the fact that what the world needs from the US is not a constant readiness to come up with troops, but constant and responsible attention, while resisting the temptation to act in a solitary and capricious manner. </p> <p>It has been disturbing in recent weeks to watch this American argument over foreign policy unfold without much awareness that a huge crisis may be just around the corner. The American effort to manage the Middle East, an effort which goes back at least 40 years and which Clinton had tried to round off with a settlement between Israelis and Palestinians, could be in terminal trouble. Yet many Americans see this only as a tragedy or a problem for the people who live there, rather than as a failure for which America may well be largely responsible and one which could affect all of us for the worse. In other regions where the US has made similar efforts to manage and control events, notably East and South-east Asia, serious trouble could also be brewing. There is hardly a region or a country where American policy could be deemed a clear success. These policies, whatever their individual worth, belong in the broad unilateralist tradition, serving American interests in ways which often ignore the real needs and the real sentiments of the countries concerned. That they may therefore not truly serve American interests either is an idea whose time ought to have come. Acts have consequences, as DW Brogan, in his introduction to Lippmann's book, implied when he called for an end to \"the illusion that the United States has complete freedom of choice, that the American people can order as much peace, security and prosperity as they want, on their own terms, in their own time.\" </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Understanding Unilateralism in American Foreign Relations (ed Gwyn Prins), Royal Institute for International Affairs</p>",
  "Charlie Perkins was, in many ways, Australia's Mandela. Indeed, had the Australian racial composition been reversed, as in South Africa, he would surely have fulfilled that role. Instead, he struggled, right up to his death at the age of 64, for justice and dignity for his people, the Aborigines, and to alert the white majority to the truth that unless they gave back nationhood to the first Australians, they could never claim their own. <p>Charlie became my friend on a blistering hot day in 1969, when he took me home to Alice Springs. Having grown up in Sydney, I was introduced to an Australia I barely knew existed. We picked up Hetti, his mother, who was waiting at the roadside, beneath a magnificent black hat. A queen of the Arrente people, she had given birth to Charlie on a tabletop in the disused Alice Springs telegraph office in 1936 or 1937; she was never sure which. </p> <p>We drove out into the red desert, heading for the federal government reserve at Jay Creek, where 300 aboriginal people were corralled in administered squalor, often without water - in 40-degree temperatures - and proper food or housing. The children had distended bellies and trachoma, which leads to blindness. This was the Australian gulag. </p> <p>The barbed wire gate was locked, and declared: \"No entry, by ministerial order\". \"What d'you, reckon, mum?\" said Charlie. \"Do it,\" said Hetti, from the back seat. I reversed the car, revved it and smashed through the gate. </p> <p>\"G'day,\" said Charlie to the white manager, whose ablutions we had interrupted. \"Where's your bloody permit?\" \"Lost it, mate,\" said Charlie. \"Now, how come these children look so bloody sick...?\" </p> <p>It was Charlie who did much to change the conditions at Jay Creek, and begin to right Australia's great wrong by bringing the most basic human rights to aboriginal people. On behalf of the most discarded minority of any white colonial country, his trailblazing role was momentous, as was his courage. </p> <p>Growing up as a mixed-race Aborigine, he was \"protected\" so that he might be \"assimilated\" - the bureaucratic language that masked the suffering of the \"stolen generation\", now recognised as a form of genocide, in which children were taken from their mothers and sent to institutions and as bonded labour. He remembered his grandmother as only a face behind barbed wire. One of his brothers killed himself, which was common among young Aborigines - and still is. Charlie himself was never stolen, because Hetti never took her eyes off him. </p> <p>\"You learned from when you were a kid to stay out of the way of whites,\" he told me. \"Our big treat was being taken to the pictures, sneaking in after the movie had started, and leaving before it ended, so that no one would object to us black kids being there. I grew up never knowing if the goodies or baddies won. Very frustrating.\" </p> <p>Charlie was sent to mission school in Adelaide, where he discovered soccer, and, at 16, was spotted by the English first-division club, Everton, which offered to pay his fare to England in the late 1950s. Later, he was invited by Matt Busby for a trial with Manchester United - and holds the distinction of turning the great man down. \"You know, I found a kind of racial dignity in England,\" he told me. \"But I was homesick.\" </p> <p>Arriving back in Adelaide in 1959, he became only the second Aborigine to graduate from an Australian university. In the mid-1960s, he led white students on freedom rides into the outback of New South Wales, with much the same objective as the freedom riders who began desegregation in the American south. Charlie and his white comrades stood at the turnstile of public swimming pools, and demanded that black children be allowed entry. </p> <p>In the town of Moree, they were spat at and assaulted, and menaced by a crowd. \"I thought we'd had it,\" he said. \"Then this black woman stepped forward and made a courageous speech, in which she pointed to a white man who had gone secretly with black women and fathered black children. 'Tell your wives what you've been doing, you bludgers,' she said. 'Go on, they're just over there. Tell 'em!' That evening, black kids were allowed into the pool for the first time. We had won the first battle.\" </p> <p>Charlie went on to win - and lose - many battles. He was manager of the Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs, which helped run the campaign that produced a resounding \"yes\" in a 1967 referendum, giving the federal government power to legislate justice for Aboriginals - a power so often neglected and misused. </p> <p>He served in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra, rising to permanent secretary, but co-option never really worked for him. He invariably spoke his mind, calling racist politcians racist; in a society renowned for its outspokeness, but in reality often embarrassed by it, he gathered enemies. </p> <p>Whenever he came to London, he would call me and say, \"Get the media out, mate. There's a demo outside Australia House that will tell the Poms about an Australia that's just like South Africa.\" Knowing his reply, I would ask how many were going: \"Just me\". Even when Sydney University gave him an honorary doctorate recently, he used the occasion to attack John Howard's government for effectively taking away the common law rights that the high court had said belonged to Aborigines - an action the United Nations has condemned as racist. He would have exploded had he heard Howard this week paying tribute to him through clenched teeth. </p> <p>Like so many Aborigines, Charlie was burdened by ill-health, although he regarded the gift of a kidney, 28 years ago, as a miracle. Most Aborigines can expect to die in their 40s and 50s. \"I beat that,\" he said, when I last saw him.

  "The Nigerian government has banned a radical Yoruba organisation which is responsible for the murders of hundreds in Lagos in days of fighting between the country's two largest ethnic groups. <p>President Olusegun Obasanjo proscribed the widely supported Odua People's Congress (OPC) and ordered the arrest of its leadership and members amid another surge in the ethnic violence that many Nigerians fear is a further step toward the Balkanisation of their country. </p> <p>Nigeria's senate empowered Mr Obasanjo to declare a state of emergency in Lagos, in the south-west of Nigeria. </p> <p>Thousands of Hausa families originally from northern Nigeria have sought protection in military barracks as soldiers have been deployed in the centre and suburbs of Lagos to stop the killings by Yoruba militants. Bodies were still lying in the street yesterday amid torched cars and buses and razed buildings. </p> <p>\"Such brutal and irresponsible acts cannot and must not be tolerated in a civilized society,\" Mr Obasanjo said. </p> <p>\"Therefore, law enforcement agencies are hereby ordered to arrest and prosecute any person who claims or presents himself as a member of the OPC and similar organisations, all of which are hereby declared illegal, unacceptable and a serious threat to the peace and security of Nigeria.\" </p> <p>The police say they have picked up more than 200 people, including two OPC leaders. \"We are going for the OPC leaders one by one. We have a list of its leaders,\" the Lagos police chief, Mike Okiro, said. </p> <p>The Red Cross said at least 100 people have been killed - although this figure is probably an underestimate - and 20,000 have been forced from their homes by the violence which began on Sunday as Yoruba militants pursued alleged thieves into a mainly Hausa area of Lagos. The attacks spread to many other parts of the city, including parts of the business district. </p> <p>Until now, Mr Obasanjo has trodden carefully around the OPC but the latest bloodletting is expected to lead to retaliatory attacks against Yorubas living in northern cities. </p> <p>It has also raised the spectre of the first attempt at secession by a Nigerian region since Biafra's failed bid for in dependence three decades ago in which more than a million died. </p> <p>The OPC was founded six years ago to promote the interests of 20m Yorubas living in Nigeria's south-west, where there is widespread resentment at years of military rule under the northern-dominated army. </p> <p>Popular support for the organisation surged after it emerged from the underground with the return of civilian government last year - just as northern states rushed to introduce hardline Islamic law, including amputations for theft and lashes for adultery. </p> <p>The imposition of Sharia law is widely viewed as a form of ethnic persecution by the mostly Christian southerners living in northern Nigeria. It has increased public backing in Lagos for the OPC's demand for political autonomy or even outright independence for south-western Nigeria. </p> <p>The ban on the OPC came after the leader of its moderate wing, Dr Frederick Fasehun, refused to sign a joint communique with Hausa leaders calling for an end to the violence. It is not clear if he is among those arrested. </p> <p>The police have spent nearly a year hunting the leader of the organisation's more radical faction, a cabinet maker called Gani Adams, who has become a folk hero in Lagos. </p> <p>He has eluded capture despite a price put on his head by the authorities and radical northern organisations for leading the ethnic killings of thousands of Hausas and eastern Igbos in Lagos. The murders provoked retaliatory massacres in other parts of Nigeria. </p> <p>Underpinning the rise in Yoruba nationalism are fears that growing disillusionment with Mr Obasanjo's government could lead to a return of military rule. His failure to revive Nigeria's economy and his bitter battles with the country's corruption-plagued parliament have been compounded by accusations of ethnic favouritism on all sides. </p> <p>Mr Obasanjo, a Yoruba, has lost support in south where he is charged with being soft on the militant Muslims behind the constitutionally questionable enforcement of Sharia law. In the north, he is accused of ignoring OPC excesses. </p> <p>The information minister, Jerry Gana, rejected the latter charge by reminding Nigerians of the near-total destruction of the south-eastern town of Odi by the army when it was ordered to quell unrest there. </p>",

  "So Gerald Corbett has offered himself as a sacrifice on the altar of public opinion. Your coverage (An honourable man in the firing line, October 19) appears to show that the gamble has paid off. His personal reputation remains intact. Yet we should be less concerned about Corbett's future and more concerned about the future of the railways. In the wake of Paddington, Corbett offered a rather different sacrifice: part-privatisation of the railways. This quickly disappeared from the agenda, despite a poll which revealed that 73% of the public wanted Railtrack brought back under public control.

  "<p>Ever noticed how much movies have in common with presidential campaigns? Whether you're running for the White House or making Armageddon, the first things you will need are a huge, nourishing infrastructure, be it a party or a studio, and a bevy of speculative investors looking for a solid return on their outlay. The biggest spender in each presidential brick-fight usually manages to offload a sum of money slightly smaller (or, at any rate, less obscenely gargantuan) than the cost of whatever movie is currently the most expensive ever made. George Dubya will therefore probably come close to spending Titanic's production budget. </p> <p>Next you'll want a campaign manager or director to handle your candidate or star - to keep them briefed, focused and on message, or merely pilled up, sober and on time. This svengali will oversee the script and arrange the scenarios, control the photo-ops and close-up allocations. The well-rehearsed, made-up, blow-dried mannequin will star in said scenarios, knowing when to hit his mark, and reading the words he's just been handed with the appropriate lathering of gravitas and sincerity. The crowd roars, star-boy wipes off his lipstick and mascara, then studiously prepares for the next ra-ra whistlestop visit. </p> <p>But the similarities really stack up during the marketing process. Whether the prize is having one's finger on the big red button or opening countrywide on July 4 weekend for a total of $53m, it's important that as many people as possible be fooled into thinking your product is best. Keep it simple, keep it clear, keep it dumb (\"It's the stupidity, stupid!\"). When high concept meets lowest common denominator, tweaking the product is essential. Bush or Gore can abandon an awkward policy commitment as easily as Warner Bros can airbrush the shagging out of Eyes Wide Shut to avoid an NC-17 rating. </p> <p>And what's the difference between a test screening and a policy focus group? Each assembles an entirely un-scientific, game-show-audience cross-section of the public and lets them dictate policies or upbeat endings. Thus students, truants and housewives are telling me who to vote for and how my movies should end. Reshoots, policy adjustments - same difference. </p> <p>Political movies rarely make money, even in election years, and this was true for Rod Lurie's thriller The Contender, which did no better than Primary Colors or Nixon. But Gary Oldman, a man of the right, created a stir last week when he claimed that the movie, which he co-produced, had been given an explicitly Democratic slant after being picked up by DreamWorks, a company with strong ties to the Clinton administration. God knows what he was expecting. Oldman plays a right-wing senator, a creature of the Gingrich ascendancy, who vows to derail Joan Allen as a mid-term replacement vice-president. Oddly enough, Oldman sees his character as the hero of the piece, which is a bit like saying Joe McCarthy and Roy Cohn were the heroes of the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings, and not army lawyer Joseph Welch. The connection is explicitly made when he's called \"a junior-league McCarthyite\", and Lurie even quotes Welch's famous rhetorical question, \"Have you no decency sir, at long last?\" at the Oldman character. </p> <p>How much faster The Contender would have plummeted toiletwards had such a Gingrich clone really been the hero. But he's not. Joan Allen is. She's the daughter of a Republican governor, but she's crossed over to the Dems (which just means she's kissed both cheeks of the same arse). But she has \"character\" and will not dignify tawdry sexual accusations with any response whatsoever - even if they're lies - because \"a principle should be adhered to even when it hurts you\". </p> <p>Noble indeed. But it ignores the fact that most American voters don't care about character. Clinton kept a solid majority of voter support throughout the Lewinsky flap, and millions would kill to be able to vote him in again next month. Why? Because what the powers that be are selling us - Bore and Gush - isn't worth having. And just as we don't get the politicians we think we deserve, neither do we get the movies. </p> <p> <strong> Make-up time for scab Liz </strong><br> </p> <p> Liz Hurley has made a formal apology to the striking Screen Actors' Guild for crossing a picket line to make a perfume commercial for Est\u00e9e Lauder. She's also promised to make a substantial contribution to the union's strike fund. She would be wise to do so because Bedazzled, Hurley's best ever chance to make it as a star, is about to be released. Yet in all of Los Angeles, you can hardly find a poster for the movie that hasn't been defaced with the word \"Scab!\" </p> <p>\"She has apologised numerous times and been really embarrassed over this,\" says her lawyer Loren Plotkin. \"She really wants to put this behind her.\" </p> <p>Apologies and bribes aside, it's pretty hard to believe that someone who's been trying for five years to make the model-to-actress crossover could have been so stupid, or that she was so ignorant about Hollywood politics that she had no idea the shoot was non-union. </p> <p><strong> Don and the defame game </strong><br> </p> <p> To Hollywood Boulevard on Tuesday morning to see Don Rickles, the king of insulting comedy, get his star on the Walk of Fame. Although you probably saw him in Casino - playing the casino manager who gets phone-whipped by Joe Pesci - Rickles, 74, is best known here as the stand-up comic who took to heart Mort Sahl's famous line - \"Is there anyone I haven't offended?\" - and ran with it all the way to the bank. </p> <p>No one was spared, not audience members, not friends, not minorities (though he's certainly no racist). He wasn't even afraid to insult his friend Sinatra at one of the infamous Friars' Club's Roasts, pointing at the chairman and saying: \"Don't just sit there, Frank. Enjoy yourself - hit somebody!\" Sinatra later replied by saying: \"Don Rickles would make a perfect stranger.\" </p> <p>Back at the ceremony, Rickles dismissed his assembled fans as \"bums passing by looking for work\". Then he trashed his celebrity guests, including Tony Danza, Bob Newhart and Dick Clark, who dubbed Rickles \"an equal-opportunity insulter\". \"So many great stars turned up that we're down to Tony Danza,\" beamed Rickles. \"Tony came over, as you saw, in his underwear and sneakers dressed for a big, big day with Don Rickles.\" </p> <p>As his fellow Casino star Alan King once told him: \"Every time you open your mouth you should be arrested for littering!\" So much for talking trash.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Cameron Crowe</strong><br></p> <p>Music is still my first love. In a lot of ways, making the movie is an exercise in getting to the point when you can be in a dark room with all the records and putting the music on the movies. I never grew up studying movies or wanting to go to film school. I loved movies, but to me it was all about music. </p> <p>Doing a film portrait of 1973 was something I talked about for a long time. Initially, I wanted to write about Lester Bangs, who was a real vivid character of the day. I got side-tracked with a bunch of projects after Jerry Maguire; then a friend of mine said, what are you screwing around with these other ideas for? You're either going to do your script about 1973 or you will have talked about it and never done it. It's the kind of the thing someone says to you at the perfect time and it's like a dagger. The truth was, I kept all the artefacts from those days, all my old articles and all the touring room lists and all the backstage passes - they've all been in boxes that have never been put away. I've been living among the boxes for 27 years, and it was time to write the script and capture that thing that was still gnawing away at me. </p> <p>It was down to my mom that I got into journalism so young. Like the character of Elaine in the movie, she was a teacher who believed in an accelerated childhood. She decided I was going to be the last kid she was going to have, and she was going to try her theory out on me. In essence, it was to go to summer school, and acquire as many course units as possible, so you would graduate early, and see the world and start your career. If you were going to take time off, her theory was to put all the summers together, and take your vacation when you graduate high school before you go to college. </p> <p> So I went to school every summer; I was the pale, egghead student. Then I discovered rock music, courtesy of my sister. Just like my mom's worst fears, rock 'n' roll came in through the window, underneath the door, all around her, and it changed both my sister and me. I was making phone calls, and getting assignments from editors who didn't know how old I was. Her plan of the accelerated educational programme gave me the confidence to do all that stuff. By the time I came to her and said, you never let me have a summer, but now I want to go on the road with the Allman Brothers, she sort of gritted her teeth and let me do it. </p> <p>My first exposure to music magazines came via a shop in San Diego where they sold Zap Comix and rock magazines. There was a guy who worked there would let me look, even though you were supposed to be 18 - it was like porno. I thought the guys that wrote for them were the greatest people - they might have trashed the music, but respected it and lived the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. There was an underground paper in San Diego, the San Diego Door, and my sister used to go out with a guy who worked for them. On the condition I wouldn't tell mom, they took me to a meeting. I wanted to do record reviews for them - and when I asked, of course they said no. Music was the tool of the corporations. Then they thought, we need the advertising from the record companies. Next thing, they told me about another guy who sent in record reviews to them - and it was Lester Bangs. </p> <p>In the movie, William is constantly trying to define what's real and what's not as the Stillwater tour continues. Lester Bangs is the only guy who says that it's all a dirty industry. Yet these people - the band, the groupies, William - are all kidding themselves that they're part of a family when they're really part of an industry. It's more of an industry as it goes on. But this film is filled with contradictions, more than any of my other ones. People are continually contradicting themselves. Even Lester is a contradiction. In the longer version of the movie - our first edit, which we'll put out when the movie goes to DVD - Lester's jealous because the kid got an assignment at Rolling Stone. </p> <p>In 1973 I went into the offices of Rolling Stone in San Francisco for the first time. Before this I had been a freelance journalist working on the end of a phone to music editor Ben Fong Torres. I'd done my first piece for them in January of that year, an interview with Poco, with Richie Furay. They paid me $350 for it. A few months later, Jann Wenner, Rolling Stone's editor, wrote me, saying: \"You may turn out the youngest Rolling Stone man ever...\" </p> <p>The Allman Brothers Band was my first major assignment for Rolling Stone. So much of it became the movie. I was 15. My mom still thinks I'm gonna go to law school. She still says: you left home when you were 15 and never came back; if I'd known who Led Zeppelin were then I'd have never let you do it. At the time I used to say: \"Listen to Stairway to Heaven! These are intelligent, committed, enthusiastic gentlemen!\" </p> <p>The thing is, when I first got out there on the road and was writing about the Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin and the Who and Lynyrd Skynyrd - and Neil Young; it wasn't the version of rock we think of today. It wasn't the penthouse-suite, we're-so-removed-from-our-fans, let's-all-be-rich-and-happy... The whole fat rich rock star thing happened later. '73 was, for me, always the year where it felt like the last moment before rock became a little less personal, a little more global. What I saw was the time before the period that's been captured in the movies in a kitsch way. A lot of that stuff came later. To me, there was a great feeling of us against the world in most of these bands. Then, all of rock music sold about the same as one Shania Twain album now, so it was a little more personal; these guys seemed to be in it for the feeling they got on stage, and hopefully girls and acclaim after that. Being too young for the girls and guys I was going to school with, it was the wildest thing to be taken in by Pete Townshend, for example. Of course, it didn't occur to me at the time that a lot of the motivation would be to get a good article out of me. But to me it was a very committed thing - it was a 70s without mirror-balls and without a lot of the faux grooviness that has been portrayed in the media. By the end of the 70s, it was a much different thing, and you had bands like the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac selling tens of millions of records. </p> <p>The interesting thing about the bands were that a lot of them were British - they were the remnants of the British Invasion. At the time there were a few albums that had gotten deep acclaim, that were loved deeply and were thought of as really powerful serious pieces of music. Who's Next, Led Zeppelin 2, Derek and the Dominos' Layla - these were albums that defined that period. But hard rock felt more American. American kids just went nuts for hard rock. Even Townshend said at the time - like with Won't Get Fooled Again - these are American youth anthems that we had no idea had such power over the audience. Led Zeppelin never took an ad on any of the tours I was on. It was all word of mouth. And they never had singles. It was all a private thing. It's kind of like Metallica now. </p> <p>Then there was the Zeppelin tour I went on; that also contributed a lot to the movie. As many people probably know, Rolling Stone tore into all of their albums. So Jimmy Page said that he'd never talk to Rolling Stone, even though Rolling Stone always wanted to put them on the cover. The LA Times sent me on tour with them, and to convince them to do Rolling Stone, I stuck around on the tour with them. And as in the movie, a couple of days turned into a long three-week tour. My eyes got blood-red because I didn't get any sleep. One by one, they all said they'd do it; except for Page, who kept saying: \"In another city, I'll make the decision.\" Of course, that becomes the focus of the movie, too, as Russell Hammond continually plays the same game with William. </p> <p>By the end of the 70s I started to burn out on journalism. I was taking on too much and taking too long with stories. I didn't know how much further I could go. I wanted to interview Marvin Gaye, but he wasn't doing any more interviews, and I really wanted to do a Rolling Stones story for Rolling Stone. That was when I started on Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Having exhausted rock journalism and having kind of hit a wall, I wanted to write this book that would be about high school and the experience I didn't have, because of my mom skipping me all those grades. I took to it immediately, because I thought it was almost more rock than rock, to write about the high school experience. Ironically, I found this entire school year was about the fact that Led Zeppelin was going to come to town; and everyone was gearing up for Zeppelin. And then Bonham died, and the tour was cancelled, and it really did change lives. The original title of Fast Times was Stairway to Heaven. I was still writing about rock, but from a different perspective. </p> <p>Celebrity journalism is different now. The story the kid files at the end of the movie, he's been the mediator a little bit, and left some of the warts out, but left quite a few of them in, and made his moral judgment on the band, and wrote about what he saw. Now, though, pieces don't get as long, the access is way different, and way cut down, all this stuff happens in a hotel room on a junket for 30 minutes. It's a different environment. There are a number of times where the bands or musicians I was writing about back in the 70s - Neil Young for example - would say: write about what you see. Part of that is that they wanted to see their life mirrored back to them; it's therapy in a way. They want to get your perspective on what's going on - how do I appear to the outside world? Of course, you never appear the way you think you do, so whenever you hold up a mirror to somebody, they're going to see things that bother them. </p> <p>The main effect of my Rolling Stone career was that I felt like I had a place in the world. I could write about this thing that I loved so much; and as rough as it was, and caught in the middle as I was, I guess it was my persona back then. I ran into Stephen Stills at a football game a year and a half ago, and he introduced me to his wife. Here's how he introduced me. \"This is Cameron. He was a fan who always got caught in the middle between wanting to be friends with us, and wanting to please Rolling Stone, who didn't like us as much as he did.\" I thought: wow, what happened to the power and mystery of journalism and writing? That was the role I played: the fan who had several masters to serve - one of which was...me. </p> <p> <strong>Charles Shaar Murray</strong><br></p> <p> 1973 as a rock and roll Annus Mirabilis? Six thousand miles away from the old Rolling Stone office in San Francisco, it felt more like a fancy-dress party somewhere in Teenage Wasteland the morning after the revolution didn't happen. For 15-year-old Cameron Crowe, torturing his mom with Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers Band it may have seemed as if a depoliticised version of the rock'n'roll hippie dream was still in full effect, but John Lennon had already announced that \"the dream is over\", and within the shabby confines of New Musical Express's funky, down-at-heel offices in Long Acre, it was - in the words of Bryan Ferry - \"time to try for something new.\" </p> <p>I'd arrived at the NME the previous summer, just before turning 21, having been headhunted from OZ and IT - the Brit underground press - and bringing their agenda with me. This meant being FOR sex, drugs and freaking out the squares by any means necessary, and AGAINST racism, corporate rock and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. By this time, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison were dead, the Beatles had broken up, the Rolling Stones were wearing their cynicism on their (album) sleeves, Bob Dylan was off somewhere being gnomic and incomprehensible, Sly Stone was sinking into hard-drug decline, and radical idealism was sprawled bleeding outside Kent State university or locked up with the Black Panthers. In America, nevertheless, it was still possible to pretend that the 60s were still alive: in Britain it wasn't. </p> <p>My generation of British rock writers had drawn an enormous amount of inspiration from the likes of Rolling Stone, which had in its first few years blasted a path for an entirely new kind of rock writing, but then settled into woozy complacency. The most inspiring of the pioneers were Greil Marcus - who brought critical rigour, piercing insight and vaulting intellectual ambition to the milieu - and Lester Bangs, whose infectious passion and furious irreverence towards established proprieties and standardised verities struck a chord with every would-be iconoclast. </p> <p>It was Lester's next port of call, Detroit's Creem magazine, that provided us with our most enduring American model. Creem was edgy where Rolling Stone was mellow; satirical where Rolling Stone was sycophantic; fun where Rolling Stone was, let's face it, dull with a capital DUH. Creem's photo captions (many of them written by Lester, as we later discovered) were either surreal jokes or sardonic digs at their subject. Where the British pop weeklies of the era treated their readers like besotted teenyboppers and their rockier equivalents addressed their punters as if they were aspiring roadies, Creem talked to you as if you were smart, adventurous and passionately committed to the music as a source of both fun and redemption. As we were, or thought we were. </p> <p>NME's ethos was straightforward: power to the people. The people in question being our readers, who had first call on our loyalty. We despised the record industry, gave not even two hoots for the sensitivities of our publisher or the profits of their shareholders, and relentlessly satirised even favourite musicians like Bryan Ferry - whose ludicrous clothes and fragile ego inspired us to seek endlessly for new ways to misspell his name. (The most memorable included Brain Fury, Biriyani Ferret, Byron Ferrari, Brown Furry and Brawn Fairy.) Americans had no idea what to make of us. Taking the piss out of the stars verged on l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9, if not outright sacrilege. </p> <p>Of course, the intrinsic differences between the British and American rock scenes were massive. America was a very big, very wealthy country where supergroups lurched around a circuit of huge arenas playing to vast crowds stuffed full of drugs. Britain was a small country with very few enormodomes and considerably lower disposable incomes. Which meant that the biggest of the British bands - Led Zeppelin, the Who, the Rolling Stones - followed the dollar and effectively became American groups: as remote from UK audiences as the Allman Brothers (who never played Britain until after guitarist Duane Allman, their star attraction, had croaked) or the Grateful Dead. Nowadays, MTV can carry a new trend all over the US almost in real time, but in the early 70s the sheer size and scale of the place meant that change occurred with agonising slowness; whereas in tiny little Britain the speed of pop-cultural events was exhilaratingly accelerated. </p> <p>The Allmans may have been the bees' knees for Rolling Stone's readers, but as far as the NME was concerned, cosmic cowboys with cocaine crusted in their walrus moustaches were last decade's thing. For us, 1973 was about the science-fiction glam-rock of David Bowie and Roxy Music, and the hypnotic new groove filtering over from Jamaica. Our taste in Americans ran more to proto-punks like Iggy Pop and the late, lamented MC5 than to hayseed millionaire hippies like Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, and our midnight turntables were more likely to be spinning Bob Marley's Burnin' or Iggy's Raw Power than any Mellow Mafia mumblings from LA. We spent the first half of the 70s willing punk into existence, though, for some of us, when it finally arrived it wasn't quite what we ordered. </p> <p>So: Golden Age of what, exactly? Well, if 1973 represented anything of that nature, it was the golden age of promotional expenditure and all the concomitant opportunities to bite the hand that fed us. In those days, record companies seemed to have unlimited amounts of money to blow on dumb stunts to promote dumber records, and we considered it our revolutionary duty to make sure that they spent as much of it as possible on entertaining us. Coaches would be chartered to schlep several dozen lurching, reeling hacks to see risibly useless bands at Bristol Colston Hall. Beer, wine and non-vintage champagne would flow as press officers, prettily accoutred in the latest company T-shirts, sauntered down the aisles dropping large chunks of hash and fresh packs of Rizla papers into passengers' waiting hands. No conceivable album was so inconsequential a cultural event that it didn't arrive bundled with T-shirts and badges, or wasn't marked by a launch party. Sometimes the bands would actually perform, which was irritating but often unavoidable. </p> <p>Indicate that you might, under certain circumstances, be prepared to write a 400-word concert review of some dodgy combo and the next thing you knew another press officer would be flying you to Amsterdam, buying you a stupefyingly expensive dinner, taking you on a tour of the red light district and uncomplainingly parting with corporate wedge to buy you a wrap of overpriced cocaine. Then you'd get home, slide behind the typewriter for 15 minutes and slag the band off. Oh how we laughed! </p> <p> The time-honoured institution of the press junket was the vehicle through which I met, albeit on different occasions, both Cameron Crowe and Lester Bangs. The teenage Crowe was the very soul of amiability: relaxed and confident beyond his years, as well he might be, considering that he was a top writer for a major publication and made considerably more money than any of us did. Bangs, despite his fearsome reputation, was a genial bear of a man and, on his visits to NME, was sufficiently sober to converse perceptively, charmingly and - bogglingly enough - quietly. </p> <p>As rock writers go, Bangs and Crowe could not have been more different. Crowe, despite his considerable talents, was essentially a fanboy: a \"friend of the stars\" who rarely upset the applecart by expressing a controversial opinion. He had the kind of presence which relaxed his subjects, made them feel protective towards him, encouraged them to open up. This is a considerable asset for an interviewer, make no mistake, and it paid off, big time. Lester, on the other hand, was essentially a critic, ranter and raconteur: a grimy prophet howling in the wilderness. His celebrated interviews with Lou Reed were knockabout classics of the genre - someone, incidentally, should adapt the transcripts of those interviews into a screenplay entitled Lester &amp; Lou before anybody here gets significantly older - but his scabrous attacks on the second-rate (especially the expensively-hyped second-rate) and passionate hymns to the transcendent power of loud, filthy noise forever barred him from the first-class lounge where publishers, performers, record companies and journalists smoothly network and conspire against the public interest. The world needs a lot more Lesters - it's a dirty job but somebody's got to do it - though comparatively few are prepared to pay the price. Lester paid it, in full, dying in 1982 at the age of 33. He died a stupid death after living a stupid life, but leaving behind him a body of work which virtually defines its genre. </p> <p>Cameron Crowe, on the other hand, will be remembered primarily for his movies. Though possibly not this one. </p> <p> \u0095 Almost Famous is the opening film of the LFF, screening at 7.30pm, November 1 at the Odeon Leicester Square and 3.15pm, November 2 at the Odeon West End. The movie will go on general release on January 26. The screenplay is published by Faber &amp; Faber at \u00a36.99.

  "<p><strong> Ghost Dog</strong><br> Rental and DVD (\u00a319.99)<br> FilmFour Cert 15 <br> **** <br> </p> <p>An unhurried, often beautiful oddball comedy, Ghost Dog is typical of Jim Jarmusch and not remotely like anything anyone else does. Like his last proper film, Dead Man, it's a kind of western, but for William Blake, accountants and Indians, read pigeons, rapping geriatric Italian mobsters, Haitian ice-cream trucks and our lead character, an existentialist samurai hit man, played serenely by Forest Whitaker. </p> <p>It bears a twisted relationship to Shane, with Whitaker's best friend being a child he is educating through books. Common to all Jarmusch's films is the incomprehension of different races and languages trying to get along (appropriately, it's a US-Japanese-German-French co-production). His New York is the polar opposite to Woody Allen's, a loose, frayed multi-ethnic community where Allen's is tightly homogeneous. </p> <p>You remember it for the mood and the moments - the bird alighting on Whitaker's gun, the murder through the sink pipe - but where most films float by, Jarmusch's stay with you. </p> <p><strong> American Psycho</strong><br> Rental and DVD (\u00a319.99)<br> EV Cert 18 <br> *** <br> </p> <p>Now that the 70s have been drained, 80s nostalgia starts here. American Psycho - a cold metallic film with the spirit of Reagan and Thatcher, Donald Trump and Gordon Gekko - is full of it. Its lead character, Christian Bale, is a Wall Street broker who works out in his flawless apartment to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre or pornography, and likes to issue reviews of Phil Collins (\"Early Genesis was too artsy, too intellectual, but now he's reached a new peak of professionalism\") to bored hookers before having sex, while admiring himself in the mirror. </p> <p>All this is reasonably amusing and Bale's self-analysis (\"I have all the characteristics of a human being but not a single emotion\") reminds us that humans ceased to be in the 80s - there was no such thing as society, either. Mary Harron keeps things sleek and chic - it looks a bit like Crash - and relatively gore-free but it's a one-track film: Fight Club trashed consumerism in 20 minutes and went on to do so much more. This just has Bale, his chainsaw and his Simpson and Bruckheimer fantasies. </p> <p><strong> Love, Honour and Obey</strong> <br> Rental Universal Pictures Cert 18<br> * <br> </p> <p> A British gangster comedy so wearisome, sloppy and shoddy as to defy belief that it could ever have been made. Everyone uses their own name to show that they're mates - a bit confusing when two of them are called Ray. There's talent involved, but only on the acting side. It substitutes guns and shouting for script, plot and character and is lumpenly unfunny and uninteresting from start to finish. </p> <p>There are two deeply depressing things about this: a) it features Ray Winstone and Kathy Burke, who only three years ago, in Gary Oldman's marvellous Nil By Mouth, showed how great a British film could match the best; and b) it was funded not by the lottery, as you'd expect of this sort of tat, but by the BBC. As we say round my manor: \"Sort it aht, Dykey.\"</p>",
  "<p>A supermarket free-for-all on discount medicines was denounced in the high court yesterday as a loss-leader trick, certain to end in higher prices, less choice for consumers and the closure of hundreds of chemists' shops. </p> <p>The last bastion of legal price-fixing in Britain, which has regulated the cost of proprietary remedies such as painkillers and cough mixture since 1964, was essential to an orderly market, three judges in London were told. </p> <p>The case, brought by the office of fair trading, will see a succession of supermarkets take the witness box over the next two months, calling for a legal end to what they call the \"healthcare price rip-off\". </p> <p>Against them, drug companies and an umbrella group of independent pharmacists will argue that supermarket claims to be the consumers' champion mask a ruthless drive to corner one of the last markets not in their grasp. </p> <p>The OFT is leading the attempt to abolish the minimum price system for medicines, the last category of goods exempt from the abolition of resale price maintenance. </p> <p>The restrictive practices division of the high court is holding the first review since 1970, when the exemption was upheld to protect small chemists. \"The situation is the same today as it was then,\" said Mark Cran QC, for the Community Pharmacy Action Group, opening the case for retaining price maintenance. </p> <p>\"Tens of thousands of vulnerable people, including the elderly, disabled and young mothers, rely on their neighbourhood pharmacist for free advice and a range of services. </p> <p>\"But these would be lost if price maintenance went, because local chemist shops would be forced out of business and product ranges would be cut because the major retailers would concentrate on just the leading brands. </p> <p>\"Supermarkets ruthlessly exploit their position. They claim to be on the side of the public but this is just not true.\" </p> <p>Mr Cran said the market was clearly tempting for the strongest proponents of change, led by Asda which yesterday announced a 20% cut in the price of its own-brand vitamins, which are not restricted by the law. </p> <p>He said: \"Every working day, the public makes more than 6m visits to Britain's 12,000 community pharmacies and they spend around \u00a332m every week.\" </p> <p>The average price for over-the-counter medicines was \u00a32 but the average cost to the NHS of a GP consultation was \u00a324, he said.</p>"
