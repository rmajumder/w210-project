  "<p>When Blair got in, the doors opened. Charities and pressure groups which had been battling for years outside the stony walls of Whitehall suddenly found themselves invited into the warmth of government. Dialogues, compacts, placements; liaison panels, working groups, consultative committees. The names may have differed, but the message was the same: we care about your issues and we want to hear what you have to say. </p> <p>Three years on, many charity and public sector leaders are finding that the doors may be open, but the minds remain closed. For campaigners working on welfare and the environment, it has often been a slow process of disillusionment, as they realise that ministers are good at lending a sympathetic ear - but unwilling or unable to deliver. </p> <p>A few have got a little of what they want. Civil liberties groups were delighted when the government moved to introduce the Human Rights Act, although they found that Labour's initial reforming zeal was soon replaced by the old Whitehall fondness for secrecy and control in the shape of a watered down freedom of information bill and legislation enabling the state to snoop on private email. </p> <p>Others have simply felt betrayed. Refugee groups had been reassured by Labour's principled rhetoric in opposition, and devoted countless hours to a two-year long consultation process on reform of the asylum system, only to find themselves confronted with new immigration legislation that sought to exclude, impoverish and criminalise asylum-seekers. </p> <p>Campaigners who have got little from Labour need to get tough. Surveying the success factors for hundreds of recent campaigns for the new Campaigning Handbook, I noted the number of times organisations had used a new generation of techniques, such as legal actions, news management and internet campaigning, to force government to the negotiating table. </p> <p>The opportunities for such influence naturally peak in a pre-election year. Before the 1997 election, the Labour Party imposed a moratorium on any new spending commitments, following the decision to stick within Tory expenditure limits. Campaigners for better welfare provision were given a lecture about the real world, and in effect asked to take it on trust. This time, that argument won't wash. Any party which wants to win next time knows it needs to deliver on health, education and welfare. But the time for getting clear commitments from the politicians will soon run out. Campaigners need to negotiate hard now if they are going to get anything more after the next election than an open door and a friendly smile. </p> <p>\u0095 Mark Lattimer is author of the Campaigning Handbook, published next week at \u00a315.95 by the Directory of Social Change (020-7209 5151)</p>",
  "The government last night faced growing calls to shut the Millennium Dome after a further \u00a347m of lottery cash was approved to avoid bankruptcy for the second time, breaking a recent commitment that it needed no extra funds. <p>Millennium commissioners sparked outrage by agreeing the emergency grant in a political face-saving deal after admitting as few as 4.5m visitors will buy tickets for the Greenwich complex, little more than a third of the 12m originally predicted. </p> <p>The commission said the latest application from new millennium experience company (NMEC) followed an external review of the company's financial position. </p> <p>\"The review has confirmed the commission's concern that there are serious failings in NMEC's financial management,\" the commission said in a statement. </p> <p>Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, the Frenchman hailed as a saviour when he arrived from Disneyland Paris this year, was effectively demoted when he was stripped of his control over its financial running in a fresh management shake-up. </p> <p>The chairman, David Quarmby, who replaced sacked Bob Ayling last May, quit the post after five months to become deputy chairman. He was replaced by City troubleshooter David James, who promised to work for free. </p> <p>The latest \u00a347m injection takes to \u00a3179m the total of public funds pledged this year to keep afloat an enterprise initially dependent on a \u00a3399m lottery grant. </p> <p>But Mr James admitted he could not guarantee the figures would add up even now, as fresh doubts were cast last night on the dome's viability despite already sucking in \u00a3578m - effectively a \u00a3128 per head subsidy for every ticket buyer and equivalent to four times the controversial subsidy at the Royal Opera House. </p> <p>One official at the NMEC, which runs the dome, privately doubted that the \u00a347m would be enough to keep it open until December. </p> <p>Mr James, currently chairman of the Robinson's soft drinks company, disclosed that the dome had been insolvent with \u00a315m in unpaid bills. A Robinson's colleague, John Darlington, is to be paid a fee to organise the sale to a consortium backed by the Japanese investment bank, Nomura, after being made an executive of the company. </p> <p>Mr James held out little prospect of the huge sum handed over ever being repaid after its sale, which is due to be finalised at the end of the year. </p> <p>\"I don't think there is any prospect of any cash recovery once the process of the sale has been completed,\" said Mr James. </p> <p>Yesterday's announcement was humiliating for Mr Gerbeau who in May said he had \"fixed the dome\" and would \"not ask the commission for any more handouts\", claiming they were loans, though Mr James made clear they could never be repaid. </p> <p>\"Whatever P-Y has said, he said with the best knowledge that he had at the time,\" said Mr James. </p> <p>The dome was intended by Tony Blair to represent all that was good about \"Cool Britannia\" and form a springboard to a second election victory after over-riding cabinet doubts to continue a project inherited from the last Tory administration. But what was supposed to be the greatest show on earth has proved an embarrassing financial black hole. </p> <p>More than 60 Labour MPs signed a Commons motion before Parliament broke up for the summer recess demanding that no more money be spent on the Greenwich white elephant. </p> <p>Last night backbencher Bob Marshall-Andrews called the latest spending spree a \"national scandal\" and added: \"It will never recoup any of this money. It is completely dead money and it is an outrage. Worse than that there is a total lack of accountability for this public money. Parliament is not even sitting.\" </p> <p>The Tories demanded the head of Lord Falconer, the Cabinet Office minister and close friend of the prime minister who inherited the dome from Peter Mandelson. </p> <p>Peter Ainsworth, the shadow culture secretary, said: \"If this is not a resignation matter, then I don't know what is. Lord Falconer is the sole shareholder in NMEC, which has been accused of serious financial mismanagement.\" </p> <p>Lord Falconer said: \"Of course, it is very, very regrettable but in terms of the public interest it is the right course to take.\" </p> <p>A two-hour meeting of the commission, chaired by Chris Smith, and attended by Mo Mowlam and Michael Heseltine, had decided earlier to approve the further \u00a347m despite assurances in May, when another \u00a329m had been agreed, that it was the last rescue package. </p> <p>A commission statement said: \"The commission is extremely sorry that there should be yet another call on lottery funds. It welcomes the full review being undertaken by the national audit office and believes that there will be important lessons to be learnt about the management of major national projects.\" </p> <p>Mr James, 62, said he was approached four weeks ago and PricewaterhouseCoopers had gone over the books. </p> <p>Shutting it before the Nomura consortium was ready to take over the dome as a theme park, he claimed, would cost up to \u00a340m more in redundancies, termination of contracts and disconnection fees. </p> <p>Asked why he had agreed to become the dome's executive chairman and work for free, four days a week until the end of the year, Mr James said: \"Like Everest, it is there, you have to climb it. I'm even providing my own secretary, my own car and costs.\"</p>",
  "The Liberal Democrats today began setting out their stall for next year's general election, resolving to increase taxation and benefits in their pre-manifesto document Freedom in a Liberal Society. <p>The party leader, Charles Kennedy, confirmed that fiscal policy would be the important battleground for the election.</p> <p>\"We remain of the view that there is a big argument to be had at the next election, and we are quite clear what side of the street we will be on when this argument takes place, about the decent funding of quality public services,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. \"You can't get something for nothing.\"</p> <p>Among the proposals were plans to introduce a new top rate tax of 50p on those earning more than \u00a3100,000 a year, while reducing taxation for those worse off by abolishing the 10p starting rate on income tax.</p> <p>The party plans to invest in the NHS, recruiting and training an extra 5,000 doctors and 20,000 nurses over three years. Prescription charges are also to be cut, while charges for dental and eye check-ups would be scrapped entirely, subsidised by a 10p increase on cigarettes.</p> <p>Contradicting William Hague's reform plans for state pensions, the Liberal Democrats also pledge to increase the basic state pension and make extra payments to the over-75s and over-80s. Child benefits are also to be increased for the youngest child under five.</p> <p>The pre-manifesto also promised more cash for the police, education and public transport.</p> <p>The Lib Dems' political opponents rounded on the proposals. The Treasury chief secretary, Andrew Smith, described the plans as \"a menu without the prices\". </p> <p>He said: \"Their sums simply don't add up. We knew already that by their own admission there was a \u00a33bn black hole at the heart of the Liberal Democrats' spending plans, but they have avoided all of the difficult decisions on tax and spending.\"</p> <p>Conservative party vice-chairman Tim Collins said: \"All the Lib Dems have told us in their pre-manifesto is that they are determined to increase taxes and scrap the pound. They are, however, silent about their desperate desire to drag Britain into a single European superstate.</p> <p>\"Their spending plans would mean huge tax hikes for many people. The mainstream majority in Britain will see straight through these ridiculous proposals. With Charles Kennedy continuing to peddle this kind of lunacy, it's clear that a Lib Dem vote is a wasted vote.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere in the pre-manifesto, Mr Kennedy's party continued its traditional commitment to radical constitutional reform and civil rights.</p> <p>Full proportional representation, abolition of the House of Lords, an extension of the electoral franchise to 16-year-olds and European constitution were outlined, as well as measures to combat discrimination and ensure asylum-seekers are treated fairly.</p> <p>On defence, as Labour party documents this week revealed plans to drop the \"ethical\" tag from current foreign policy, the Liberal Democrats promise to end subsidies for arms sold to foreign regimes and work for the elimination of all nuclear weapons.</p>",

Child benefits are also to be increased for the youngest child under five.</p> <p>The pre-manifesto also promised more cash for the police, education and public transport.</p> <p>The Lib Dems' political opponents rounded on the proposals. The Treasury chief secretary, Andrew Smith, described the plans as \"a menu without the prices\". </p> <p>He said: \"Their sums simply don't add up. We knew already that by their own admission there was a \u00a33bn black hole at the heart of the Liberal Democrats' spending plans, but they have avoided all of the difficult decisions on tax and spending.\"</p> <p>Conservative party vice-chairman Tim Collins said: \"All the Lib Dems have told us in their pre-manifesto is that they are determined to increase taxes and scrap the pound. They are, however, silent about their desperate desire to drag Britain into a single European superstate.</p> <p>\"Their spending plans would mean huge tax hikes for many people. The mainstream majority in Britain will see straight through these ridiculous proposals. With Charles Kennedy continuing to peddle this kind of lunacy, it's clear that a Lib Dem vote is a wasted vote.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere in the pre-manifesto, Mr Kennedy's party continued its traditional commitment to radical constitutional reform and civil rights.</p> <p>Full proportional representation, abolition of the House of Lords, an extension of the electoral franchise to 16-year-olds and European constitution were outlined, as well as measures to combat discrimination and ensure asylum-seekers are treated fairly.</p> <p>On defence, as Labour party documents this week revealed plans to drop the \"ethical\" tag from current foreign policy, the Liberal Democrats promise to end subsidies for arms sold to foreign regimes and work for the elimination of all nuclear weapons.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/politics/story/0,3604,365244,00.html\">Liberal Democrat pre-manifesto digest</a><br><a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/documents/Freedom.pdf\" target=\"_new\">Full pre-manifesto document (pdf file)</a> </p> <p> </p>",

  "<p><strong>ANTI-FASH-ISM</strong></p> <p>The Fiver wouldn't mind betting a shilling or two that when Nwankwo Kanu was at school he was the quiet one. The sort of kid whose best friend was a beaten-up football, and whose only enemy was the night sky that forced him indoors. But when the ambassador for Nigerian sport, John \"Fash the Bash\" Fashanu, warned Kanu this week that he \"shouldn't go back to Nigeria for his holidays for the next 20 years\" if he pulled out of their Olympic squad, something snapped.</p> <p>\"I find the statements made by John Fashanu both reprehensible and hypocritical,\" a rightly furious Kanu raged earlier today. \"It should be remembered that in his playing days he chose to desert Nigeria and play for England instead. He has no right to criticise me when I have given so much to the country I love.\" And just in case there was any doubt over Kanu's state of mind, he finished by insisting that: \"John Fashanu's statements have only strengthened my resolve.\"</p> <p>And just to prove that standing up to playground bullies really can work (although the Fiver, for legal reasons can't condemn or condone never mind condom that sort of thing), Fash has apologised for his actions. \"Kanu is my brother. He's Nigerian like me,\" the Bash explained unconvincingly. \"Kanu has sweat blood for Nigeria and if it wasn't for serious reasons he would be in Sydney defending the gold medal.\" </p> <p>Fash then completed his volte-face by apologising to Arsene Wenger, \"who only two weeks ago I had breakfast with - I hope this doesn't sour our relationship. Nigeria and Arsenal are looking to build relationships, not break bridges.\" Well done the Bash.

He pulled up with a groin injury after crossing the ball one minute into last night's 3-2 comeback victory over Everton. Before bumping his head on the tunnel on the way to the changing room. And crashing his car on the way to the consultant. And scalding himself with the Teasmade this morning, before poking himself in the eye with a cereal spoon.</p> <p>\"I won't know for certain [about the severity of the injury] until I have the scan but it certainly seems as though there is a tear,\" Sicknote told the London Evening Standard today. \"If that is the case then it usually takes around four weeks to sort out.

Wise is expected to feature for the Blues after recovering from a knee knock he picked up in the England game. Arsenal meanwhile look likely to partner Gilles Grimandi with Ray Parlour in central midfield, while Sylvain Wiltord (who may not have scrapped with anyone at all on Saturday) will get a place on the bench.</p> <p> Scrutiny of this match will be high, with local police set to speak to Mike Reid (oh dear) and his fellow officials about keeping a lid on the game. Arsene Wenger meanwhile has added his own tuppence worth of wisdom. \"We will try to go for the ball,\" he said. \"If you expect me to say to the players 'don't go for the ball' then we might as well play feminine football.\" Which is fair enough, if a little insulting.

  "<p>It is 6.45am on Wandsworth Common. It is still dark and there is hardly anyone about. Just two little boys in custard-yellow fleeces running. Ojay and Troy Keen are out training with their father Derek, whose dream is that at least one of them will become a Premiership footballer. \"Come on! Don't slow down, Troy!\" shouts Derek. A little voice comes back: \"I can't, I can't.\" Derek shouts again: \"Quicker, Troy! You're going too slow!\" </p> <p>Derek is a devoted soccer dad. He takes his sons for early morning runs, he spends his weekends and evenings ferrying them to training and matches; he watches their performances as closely as Alex Ferguson watches Beckham and Giggs. He's a season ticket holder at Chelsea but he'd much rather watch his sons playing in the local boys' Sunday league. </p> <p>Especially Ojay. Because Ojay, the elder of the two boys, is going to make it. Derek feels it in his bones. Ojay, he says, is like a mini Roy Keane, but faster and more skilful. He's 10 years old and he's the best of his age his dad has seen. \"I love watching him play. You're watching your own flesh and blood out there. I feel proud. Very, very proud.\" </p> <p>Derek and his sons are featured in a Modern Times television documentary called Go On My Son!, which follows a group of fathers involved in boys' football in south London. It's entertaining, thought-provoking television, raising interesting issues about father-son bonding, about talented children, ambitious parents and the potential dangers when the two are combined. </p> <p>The world of sport is full of ambitious, pushy parents, but football - our national sport and obsession, the stars of which are constantly paraded before us, with their ever increasing wealth and status - is in a league of its own. </p> <p>Parents sign up their four-year-olds for football training; fathers are willing to make a pact with the devil to secure a place for their son in the Arsenal under-12s. But with all the risks, the disappointments and the pressure involved, it hardly seems a desirable career choice for your child. Or does it? </p> <p>\"I want it all day long for him,\" Derek says unambiguously. \"If you are going to do a job you enjoy and get paid for it, why not? I wouldn't make him do it for the love of the money. I want him to do it for the love of the game.\" </p> <p>On the south London youth football circuit, Derek must be among the most vocal. He stands on the sidelines, his hands thrust deep into his pockets, hurling gobbets of advice, criticism and - occasionally - praise at his son. \"Ojay, move up. Move up!\" He groans and turns away in despair. \" I'm pissed off with this. Ojay, move up !!\" When Ojay comes off the field, Derek tells him it's the worst he's seen him play. Ojay runs off, distraught. Meanwhile, Troy, who is playing elsewhere, watched by his mother, Dawn, is upset because he thinks his dad is more interested in Ojay than him. </p> <p>Off the pitch, Derek, a 40-year-old builder, is much less fearsome. The kitchen of the family's terraced house is filled with football trophies, there is football on the television and the small back garden is dominated by a set of goalposts. Ojay and Troy, who is nine, were still in the baby walker when they started messing around with a football; they went to their first Chelsea match when they were two. Derek's father, who died when he was 14, did not share his interest in football. Derek never got the support he now gives to his sons and he feels he missed out. </p> <p>Derek insists that his sons don't miss out on anything; they do exactly the same things as other children. Their schoolwork is good; they have friends and other interests; but Derek is very serious about their football. If he thinks they've been slacking during training, when everyone else is going home at the end he makes them do it again. At school, he has instructed Ojay not to play football at playtime because of the risk of injuring his joints on the concrete playground. \"I don't hear anyone moaning about Tiger Woods's dad pushing him,\" he says. </p> <p>He is determined that Ojay will not lose his focus as he gets older. One girl has already been ringing him up, trying to get him interested in her. \"I said to him straight, these girls are not coming between you and your football. I've seen it happen, at 14 or 15, they want girlfriends, they're going out all the time, they're having their first four or five pints, and they're not turning up for their matches. I'm not going to let that happen.\" Ojay, a beautiful, quiet boy with an inscrutable face, shrugs when you ask him about the pressure. \"It's OK with me. I like playing football.\" </p> <p>But what if Ojay decides he doesn't want to pursue his football? \"The day my son turns to me and says he doesn't want to do it I'll be upset, but it's something I'm going to accept straightaway. I would never want that to happen, but if it happens, it happens. If Ojay wanted to be a solicitor, or a doctor, that's fine by me. Whatever makes him happy.\" He almost sounds convincing, then he adds: \"But I couldn't help him out as much.\" In other words , football is something they can share together as father and son - law and medicine they cannot. </p> <p>A mutual interest between parent and child is an important part of bonding - as reflected in tonight's film - according to educational psychologist Professor David Fontana, but there are enormous dangers if the child has not got the talent or motivation. \"Certainly it's important if the child is very good at something, to support them physically by taking them to matches and emotionally by sharing in their success. </p> <p>But it's very important for parents to realise that what's interesting for a child, whether it's music or sport, that interest may not last into adult life. If there's failure later on, there's not only the father's feeling of being let down, but the son's feeling of letting the father down. </p> <p>Childhood, says Fontana, is a part of life that is valid in and of itself. It should not simply be a preparation for adult life. \"If parents invest too much of themselves, their time, money and ambitions, and their children cannot live up to that, it's very destructive for the relationship between the parent and child and also for the child's self-esteem.\" </p> <p>Jack Tarr, chairman of the English Schools Football Association, also urges fathers to be cautious. \"It's nice to be able to go into the pub and say - my son plays for Chelsea under 12s. But the chances of going all the way - well, it really is clutching at straws. There are so few boys who can possibly make it into the premier league.\" </p> <p>\"Football is a wonderful game,\" says Tarr. \"But it's a game that can lead to great disappointment. Certainly when you think of boys who do make the grade, there will always be a very supportive father - and mother. </p> <p>\"But be wary. He might be the one in a million who makes the grade, but there are not many of them.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Modern Times: Go On My Son is on BBC2 tonight at 9pm.</p>",
  "<p>Emergency - which service? Even those of us who have never had to dial 999 are familiar with the phrase. But while the single initial contact, provided by a BT or Cable and Wireless operator, gives the impression of a co-ordinated system for despatching emergency services, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, behind the scenes each emergency service runs its own control room, sometimes more than one. In a world supposed to be striving for joined-up government, 999 callers needing more than one emergency service are frequently required to make their request for assistance and give their details three separate times. </p> <p>To the man on the street, the existence of three separate control rooms for local emergency services is nonsensical. Yet across England and Wales, 43 police forces, 38 ambulance trusts and 50 fire brigades boast as many as 192 separate control rooms. When the government came to power, it committed itself to ending this duplication of services. In 1998, the then health secretary Frank Dobson told ambulance services: \"The taxpayer can't be expected to pay out three times over and we must look for the best deal for all these services. This means looking at joint control and communication systems. That's got to make sense.\" </p> <p>The proposal for joint control operations has already been shown to work in other countries. Dobson said the policy had backing across government. </p> <p>Since his declaration, three pilot schemes - in Cleveland, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire - have kicked off with funding from the government's \"invest-to-save\" budget. But there are growing doubts that the rest of the country will follow suit. </p> <p>The prime benefit of shared control rooms should be a more effective response to emergencies. \"That could simply mean a faster response, and in many emergencies seconds can save lives,\" says Phil Bland, project manager for the shared control room project in Cleveland. \"Or it could mean that a multi-service response is better resourced, more co-ordinated and has the right equipment.\" </p> <p>So called \"first responders\" are already being established in emergency services, carrying equipment such as defibrillators for heart attack victims. Often it may be that a fire engine or police car with trained personnel and the right equipment is closer to an incident than the nearest ambulance. But at the moment, the ambulance control room would have to make a couple of phone calls to find out. The new system in Cleveland would automatically provide that information across all three emergency services. \"We could see where the nearest appropriately trained resource was from the mapping system,\" says David Craig, chief executive of Tees, East and North Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS trust. \"It is about reducing delay in critical situations when someone is suffering.\" </p> <p>Cleveland is the most advanced project, with ambulance control staff already moved in to the control room at the police headquarters - albeit still working on different computer systems. Both Gloucestershire's and Wiltshire's projects involve building new premises to house the shared control rooms. All projects claim major benefits. Wiltshire is adamant that a shared control room will enable mobilisation of the three services in parallel, rather than in series, improving overall response times to incidents. And according to Gloucestershire's deputy chief fire officer, John Bonney, on top of the service benefits there will be significant cost savings through buying equipment and services in bulk. </p> <p>Cleveland estimates that co-location of control rooms will save some \u00a3300,000 a year from 2003 through having a single software licence, centralised system maintenance and common fall-back arrangements. But it is perhaps in integration of control room staff where most cost savings lie. According to Bland, Cleveland could save an additional \u00a3125,000 a year from more flexible use of staff. All services have quiet patches, particularly in the middle of the night, and it is hard to justify three separate control rooms in such circumstances. </p> <p>Despite such prospects, all three projects have currently stopped short of real integration, opting instead for co-location of control rooms (shared controls) rather than actually merging operations (joint controls). In part, this is a recognition of the different protocols governing the different control room staff. Urgency of response is graded by the police and by ambulance services that have introduced priority-based despatching, while the fire service normally provides an immediate response to all calls. Each service asks different questions and takes different amounts of details before despatching an emergency vehicle. For fire services it takes an estimated 30-60 seconds from the receipt of the call to the transmission of a mobilisation message; for police and ambulance, it takes two to three minutes. </p> <p>But there is another more basic problem. Control room staff are naturally concerned about job cuts. And there are also huge variations in their pay, with fire service control staff earning some \u00a37,000 a year more than those in the ambulance service. Perhaps predictably, the Fire Brigades Union is having none of these \"merger\" proposals. In Cleveland, where the joint project admits to a long-term goal of moving towards generic call-takers and despatchers, once co-location has been evaluated, firefighters are already threatening to ballot for strike action. </p> <p>Recently, the union seems to have had some backing from a strange source. A report commissioned by the Home Office has recommended the creation of bigger, regional control rooms within the fire service and rejected joint or shared controls across all emergency services. The report, intended as guidance for fire authorities conducting \"best value\" reviews of control rooms this year, claims that \"joint controls [with common call takers] are unlikely to be feasible in the medium term at least\" while shared controls would \"impede the organisational development of the fire service and result in only minor savings\". </p> <p>Although the report says the invest-to-save pilots should continue to be supported and encouraged, it is hardly promoting joined-up government. At face value, it seems to shatter the cross-departmental support for the pilot schemes promised by Dobson two years ago. To many, it is just the fire side of the Home Office protecting its empire. But the public may pay a high price for such protectionism if it means the emergency services miss an opportunity to improve response times and save taxpayers' money.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Where there's no will... </strong></p> <p> Why is it still difficult, with equality and service legislation in place, and a 20-year history of equal opportunity regimes and policy drafting, for local authorities to put these policies fully into practice? (Making equality second nature, August 30). </p> <p>Frances Carter hopes that \"their desire to do the right thing, and legislation and pressure from community groups\" will improve the delivery of services. But we are dealing with institutionalised discrimination in councils whose culture allows the serial trivialisation and marginalisation of their own equality policies. </p> <p>Councils have the power, and the duty, to ensure that these policies are carried out. Why then do they still fail? My experience is that there is no extensive desire, on the part of the political or officer memberships of these councils, to carry through equalities policies to the point of upsetting old patterns of privilege. And community pressure is only effective when applied by powerful groups. </p> <p>We should no longer leave it to the \"desire\" of local authorities to eliminate discrimination. What is needed are regulatory and enforcement procedures, monitored by external agencies, carrying exemplary penalties on individual staff as well as councils as a whole. </p> <p>Over the past 20 years, here and there, a minority of members and officers has tried to maintain a movement for equality.

  "<p>Her flat is damp. It has no central heating. Pipes are \"constantly\" leaking. Now her one-year-old son has asthma. Charlotte can rattle off a long list of other complaints about high-rise living on the edge of Glasgow city centre. But like many tenants battered by bureaucracy's apparent inability to tackle basic repairs, she has given up hope.</p> <p>Even scaffolding, clamped to the side of the crumbling 60s structure, in a belated stab at installing double glazing, fails to impress the 22-year-old. \"They should knock this lot down instead of putting all these windows in,\" she says, a faint smile betraying deepening resignation. \"Everything here is bad, really bad. It's like the house that Jack built, freezing in the winter and damp in the summer. I hope to get out soon -to England.\" </p> <p>Across what passes for a square in the St George's Cross district, littered with rubble and broken glass (\"more wear and tear than vandalism - don't blame the weans [children],\" sighs a middle-aged woman) Gordon Dodd is walking his six-year-old son home in the late evening. While his low-rise flat nearby is in slightly better repair - \"although heating would be nice\" - he is under no illusions about the scale of the problem facing Britain's biggest council landlord. \"To be honest, half the houses in Glasgow need to be bulldozed and rebuilt. These big blocks of flats [the city has 150] are no use to man or beast. They're in a terrible condition.\" </p> <p>A mile away, surveying the city from his new office in Glasgow's business quarter, the man charged with sorting out a housing crisis would not disagree. \"The stock is in a hellish condition and everyone realises it is not fit for the 21st century, for the dignity of people who want to stay in their homes,\" admits Bob Allan, chief executive of the embryonic Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) and former head of a nearby local authority. \"It's saddled with debt, dampness, cold, poor electrics - everything far worse than the UK average.\" </p> <p>After years of defensiveness, no one in authority disputes that the city's 94,000 council flats and houses are among the worst in Britain. Only a quarter reach acceptable standards, while a further quarter are seen as \"saveable\". The remaining 50%, in areas like St George's Cross and elsewhere, are in such poor condition that they face an uncertain future in a city which, because of low demand, has been demolishing 2,300 council houses annually since 1993. </p> <p>Saddled with a housing debt approaching \u00a31bn and facing a repairs backlog of \u00a31.2bn for stock deteriorating by the day, Glasgow city council has thrown ideology to the wind. Memories of that old political cliche, Red Clydeside, may still linger in older hearts; after all, the government in 1919, fearing a Bolshevik uprising, put tanks on the streets outside the city chambers. </p> <p>But now the Labour pragmatists running the city chambers have decided to get rid of that monument to municipal socialism - council housing. In a move certain to set the pace for big English cities - notably Birmingham - it is preparing to hand over its entire stock to Allan's housing association next year, provided tenants vote \"yes\" in a city-wide ballot. </p> <p>The move has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the Scottish executive and the young minister for communities, Wendy Alexander, whose enthusiasm and direct involvement - she co-chairs a steering group with councillors - has clearly ruffled feathers in the marbled city chambers. </p> <p>\"We have an opportunity to create a new, positive spirit in many communities,\" Alexander has said. \"From initial soundings with tenants' groups there is a genuine desire for constructive change. Tenants will lead the way throughout the entire process . . . this will be for the people of Glasgow, by the people of Glasgow.\" </p> <p>As part of the deal with the council, the executive has agreed to go one step further than its Whitehall equivalent by servicing Glasgow's housing debt from its own funds. Free of this financial albatross, the emerging GHA would then set about tackling the repairs backlog and (in Allan's words) \"rebuilding communities\". As debt repayment accounts for half the average weekly rent of \u00a345, this is no mean subsidy. </p> <p>The other attraction for the council, target of constant sniping from disgruntled tenants, is that housing associations, unlike local authorities, can get loans from banks and building societies - using the income stream from rents as collateral. As a result, the council hopes that institutions, including possibly the European Investment Bank, will help raise around \u00a31.6bn over 10 years to smarten up what remains of the former municipal stock. </p> <p>Both Alexander and the council are adamant that the GHA must be a non-profit making mutual association, controlled by communities and not by businessmen. After the ballot, the idea is to shift control to some 14 area organisations - and eventually fur ther down the chain to smaller associations of about 500 houses each. </p> <p>But assurances of mutuality have failed to halt criticism that the housing transfer smacks of backdoor privatisation. Tommy Sheridan, a Scottish Socialist Party councillor and a member of the Scottish Parliament, says opposition will match the great anti-poll tax campaign, which he led in the late 1980s. \"This will develop into a very bitter and bloody battle,\" he insists. \"There is a tremendous amount of fear. For the first time in modern history, Glasgow will be left without a council house if this goes through.\" </p> <p>Sean Clerkin, who chairs a Glasgow-wide campaign against stock transfer, claims the plan is not only a \"test bed for council house privatisation throughout the UK\", but also an issue which could seal Alexander's fate as a minister. \"It will either be her big success story,\" he says, \"or the noose that hangs her because she's that closely associated with it.\" </p> <p> Charlie Gordon, Labour leader of Glasgow, accepts the issue is so emotive that the council and the Scottish executive have some way to go in convincing 94,000 tenants. He says: \"There is a folk memory in Glasgow of what it was like renting from private landlords and older people [over a quarter of tenants are pensioners] remember exploitation and the rest of it.\" </p> <p>If a ballot were held tomorrow -rather than next year - Gordon accepts that the plan would be overwhelmingly rejected. \"This is a process and we are still in the early stages,\" he says, accusing opponents of being \"politically motivated dogmatists\", unwilling to accept plans for \"another form of social ownership\". </p> <p>Others are not so restrained. In a recent newsletter, produced on behalf of the council and the Scottish executive, critics were accused of feeding Glaswegians \"a diet of fear, half-truths and misinformation\" about rocketing rents, widespread redundancies, and privatisation. </p> <p>But with more than 2,000 staff in the housing department, and a further 3,000 employed by the council's direct labour organisation (DLO) - mainly on council house repairs - job losses are clearly a fear. That is why the Scottish TUC is opposed to the scheme, although job assurances, and a commitment to give a contract to the DLO after the transfer, will be given. Allan's next step will be formally to present a transfer package to the council by the end of the year, outlining investment and rent levels, the structure of his organisation and tenancy agreements. If the authority accepts, plans for a ballot will be set in train. </p> <p>To win hearts and minds, he says publicity material will have to be free of hype and spin. \"We have to do this in an honest and open way rather than as a smart piece of salesmanship.\" In the end, he believes they will get a \"yes\". \"But we will have to work hard for it.\" </p> <p>One thing is clear. If the vote goes against the council and the Scottish executive - so far, in smaller author ities, stock transfer ballots have exceeded general election turnouts - ministers will not let matters rest. \"The status quo is not an option,\" insists Allan. </p> <p>But in St George's Cross, and elsewhere, it is clear that the GHA has some explaining to do. \"I'm afraid they might make us go private,\" laments Jean Thomas, who has lived on the 11th floor of a block for 23 years. \"You hear so much about private landlords putting you out. We're all right the way we are, aren't we?\" </p> <p>Gordon Dodd isn't so sure. \"To be honest, I don't think there is an option. I'll vote yes. It's a bold step they're taking. I just hope housing remains an integral part of society in the future. I was with a private landlord before I got a council flat and wouldn't like to go back to that.\"</p> <p><strong>South of the border </strong></p> <p>In England, 450,000 houses have already been hived off, with 165,000 likely to follow in this financial year - although 3.2m still remain in council hands. But no big city has transferred its housing, largely because of uncertainties over huge debts. Birmingham, with a debt of \u00a3650m, is holding talks with the Department of the Environment, but the ruling Labour group is clearly divided on the issue. The Conservatives have accused unions, and Labour dissidents, of being at odds with the official line on transferring 92,000 homes - slightly fewer than Glasgow - to a series of social companies. </p> <p>While English ministers insist that councils will not be forced to get rid of their houses, the Chartered Institute of Housing has calculated that 200,000 homes annually will have to be transferred if the government is to meet its target of clearing a \u00a319bn repairs backlog in 10 years.</p> <p>But the scale of the challenge to win over tenants was illustrated last month at Wycombe district council, Buckinghamshire, when tenants opposed transferring 7,150 houses to a new social landlord in a postal ballot which registered a near 70% turnout.</p>",

  "William Hague mapped out the Tories' general election battle plan yesterday when he unveiled the party's \"mini-manifesto\" which combined hardline pledges to distance Britain from the European Union with softer commitments to tackle social divisions. <p>With less than a year to go until the expected date for the general election, the Tory leader dismissed recent polls to declare that his party could return to power once voters embrace his \"commonsense revolution\". </p> <p>Many of the details in the Tories' pre-election manifesto, including plans to end state funding of universities and to detain all asylum seekers, have already been leaked. </p> <p>But Mr Hague outlined a few surprises yesterday, including a plan to give young people the right to invest their state pension money into private schemes and a plan to end the health secretary's day-to-day role in running the NHS. </p> <p> </p> <p> <b> Pensions</b> </p> <p>Young people would be encouraged to save for retirement through a state-funded alternative to the basic state pension. Anyone who opts for the scheme would be given a sum of money each month -equivalent to the amount which would eventually fund their state pension - to place in a private or occupational scheme. </p> <p>The mini-manifesto said: \"We wish young people to build up a funded alternative to the basic pension for the future. No one would be forced to change. The basic state pension would continue to be paid as now, not merely to current pensioners but to people of working age and new entrants who want it in the future.\" </p> <p> <b> Health service</b> </p> <p>The NHS would be transformed by ending direct political control of the health service, ending centrally imposed waiting lists and encouraging greater use of the private sector. Pledging to take \"politicians out of day-to-day management of the NHS\", the document said: \"The secretary of state's role will be to set a strategic framework of health policy, agree funding and guarantee minimum standards of quality.\" </p> <p>Patients would be given a maximum waiting time \"based exclusively on their medical need\". The document added: \"That time will be determined by their consultant and will meet the the individual patient's circumstances, not an arbitrary average. The health authority will be required either itself to treat the patient within that waiting time, or to arrange for the patient to be treated in another health authority or to pay for treatment in the independent sector.\" </p> <p> <b> Economy</b> </p> <p>The document confirmed that Mr Hague has abandoned his guarantee to reduce taxes regardless of the state of the economy. Instead the Tories have pledged to cut taxes if the economic conditions are right. </p> <p>It said: \"We will be a tax cutting government - in all normal circumstances we will reduce the burden of taxation. Such a policy is economically right and it is morally right.\" </p> <p>The Tories pledged to match Labour spending in health and education, but to cut spending in other areas. The document said: \"Government cannot spend what the nation hasn't earnt. It is not sustainable for government spending to grow faster than national income.\" </p> <p> <b> Europe</b> </p> <p>Mr Hague reiterated his pledge to oppose the European single currency for the lifetime of the next parliament. He also promised to oppose moves towards a \"fully integrated superstate\" by introducing new legislation to prevent EU law from overriding the will of parliament, except in areas ceded by Westminster. </p> <p>The document said: \"Down one road lies a fully integrated superstate, with nation states and the national veto disappearing. This is the route down which Britain is gradually disappearing. The alternative route, our route, is to a Europe of nations combining in different combinations for different purposes and to a different extent, a network of Europe.\" </p> <p> <b> Law and order</b> </p> <p>A war \"as never before\" would be waged against criminals. The Tories pledged to reverse the cuts in police numbers; overhaul the law in favour of the likes of the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin who was jailed for murdering a burglar; abolish the early release scheme; and to hand out mandatory sentences to drug dealers who sell to children. </p> <p>\"Crime is rising again and yet there are fewer police,\" the document said. \"Violent crime is soaring and yet thousands of violent offenders have been released early from jail. The mainstream majority thinks that government is too often on the side of the criminal rather than the victim.\" </p> <p> <b> Education</b> </p> <p>Central control over education would be ended by funding schools directly and using government auctions to set up multi-billion pound endowments to fund Britain's universities. </p> <p>The document said: \"Too much central political interference is damaging standards in our schools. Parents instinctively know what makes a good school. It is a place with an enthusiasm for learning and with a strong ethos and values. We want to give schools the freedom to become such places.\" </p> <p> <b> Inner cities</b> </p> <p>Britain's inner cities would become \"attractive, clean and crime-free places\" through a series of \"radical new approaches\". The worst tower blocks will be pulled down and new laws will be introduced to crack down on \"bad neighbours\". </p> <p> <b> Family</b> </p> <p>The Tories will attempt to win back their reputation as the party of the family by restoring the married couples' tax allowance. They would also introduce \"family scholarships\" to help parents to retrain when they return to work after taking a break to look after their children. </p> <p>Mr Hague said his proposals amounted to an ambitious alternative for Britain which the British people would embrace. \"Believing in Britain is a striking new social agenda for Conservatism based on one very simple, very Conservative principle: freedom,\" Mr Hague said. \"Freedom for parents, for families, for pensioners, for teachers and doctors and nurses.\" </p> <p> <b>Main points:</b> <br></p> <p>\u0095 Young people to be provided with state-funded alternative to basic state pension </p> <p>\u0095 Health secretary to be deprived of day to day role in running the NHS and centrally-imposed waiting lists to be dropped </p> <p>\u0095 Taxes to be cut \"in all normal circumstances\". Tories would match Labour funding on health and education, but cut spending in other areas </p> <p>\u0095 Pound would be saved for lifetime of next parliament as Tories oppose moves to \"fully integrated superstate\" </p> <p>\u0095 Fall in police numbers to be reversed and prisoner early release scheme to be abolished</p>",
  "\"Take it away\" Winston Churchill once said of an unsatisfactory object plonked in front of him. \"This pudding has no theme.\" He might have said much the same had he lived to see the publication yesterday of his old party's policy statement, Believing in Britain, around which the Conservatives plan to build their appeal to voters in perhaps seven months from now. There is no one flaming message here to ignite and inspire the electorate. If you put in your thumb and pull out a plum, it may or may not be related to the main ingredient in the mix, which seems to be self-determination - from self-determination in Europe, rather than constant surrender to Brussels, to self-determination in universities (see below) and schools, where parent power is to supersede that of the local authority. <p>The commitment on Europe is crucial. Here, William Hague clearly believes, is a message that chimes with the mood of the broad electorate. Generations have fought, sweated, even died for the right to decide our own future. Let there be no further surrender. There is, in fact, a lurch towards reality here: what is promised today falls well short of the pledge this time last year to roll back the treaties to which we already subscribe. Yet even what remains is of dubious credibility. The commitment now is to alter domestic law to prevent Westminster's will being overriden by Brussels. Are we really asked to suppose that our partners in the EU will emolliently agree to this decidedly uncommunitaire proposition? And even in electoral terms, it may not be the surefire winner Mr Hague thinks. Though the mood of the country is Euro-sceptical, there is also an army of undecideds who might be swayed either way as the election approaches. Nor is there, on past evidence, any likelihood that the issue of Europe will turn out to be decisive in determining how Britain votes. </p> <p>There are signs of grace here and there. Self-determination at home means decentralisation, a welcome change from the rampant centralisation of the last Conservative government. Even poor battered local government would benefit: though set to lose its control over education, it is promised new freedom from government interference. There are other healthy signs too of lessons belatedly learned such as the party's conversion to devolution in Scotland and Wales. Better still, the Tories, rejecting Tony Blair's timidity, want a reformed second chamber to be largely elected. </p> <p>Yet such glimpses of virtue hardly offset the deficiencies. Though the ludicrous tax guarantee offered a year ago has been sensibly lost, there is still little indication of how they could hit their target of tax cuts \"in all normal circumstances\" without savage cuts in the programme set out in Labour's spending review. Like the plan to set universities free from government, which so far seems a bit of a mystery even to Mr Hague's education spokesman, the proposal for a funded alternative to the basic state pension yesterday defeated even the wit of a man with two brains (social security spokesman David Willets) to make it coherent. There's an awful lot left to be clarified between now and next year. </p> <p>There is also, cropping up time and again in this document, an almost comic assumption that electors next May will have forgotten that the party now seeking their votes is the one that ran the country up till four years ago. For instance: \"excessive day-to-day regulatory interference\", the document trills, is the blight of the railway system. That is not what you hear on the platforms of Virgin, Connex, and South-West Trains. </p> <p><b>Complete policy statement at:</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.tory.org.uk/believinginbritain/\" target=\"_new\">William Hague's Believing in Britain campaign</a></p>",
  "<p>Ghastly, cynical, dissipated, distasteful, a new low, tedious, desperate, voyeuristic, seedy, a sham, pointless, sad and pathetic, creepy, inane, barrel-scraping, phoney, gross, tacky . . . all comments from national newspapers about Big Brother. Time to take up lettuce growing in the Scilly Isles? Certainly not. Particularly in view of last week's drama when Nick was finally rumbled and made his hasty exit.</p> <p>But apparently we are definitely guilty of manipulation. Here's Paul Watson in this newspaper: \"It was phoney from the start . . . straight away I felt manipulated by others than those I was watching . . . The suspicion that somebody was manipulating them became more obvious. Why did the women go to the door to find the clay penis made by the men?\" Watson is the justly celebrated director of The Fishing Party, Sylvania Waters and The Dinner Party. But when he accuses us of manipulation it feels like being attacked by Richard Branson for publicity-seeking. I think I know what is really bugging Watson and other moaners and groaners from the documentary freemasonry. Big Brother has put all the tricks of their trade on open display. We have Penn-and-Tellered them. Not for us the tongue-loosening wine supplied by the production behind the scenes, the discreet suggestion as to what they should talk about, the results shown as naturally occurring events. Not for us the traffic wardens, customs officers, driving instructors (delete where necessary) resolutely pretending they haven't got cameras pointing up their nostrils. Big Brother is unashamedly upfront. </p> <p>There are the cameras on the wall (now nicknamed by the participants - \"Charlie\" is their favourite). If Big Brother wants them to talk about their first love you will hear it suggested. Call it manipulation if you like but it happens on camera and not behind the tapestry.</p> <p>A Sunday newspaper journalist, hot on our trail, then accuses us of being selective because we televise only half an hour a day and edit out the rest. Yes, Lord Copper, that's how all TV gets made. We offer to show him our rushes - an offer gratefully accepted. But unfortunately this is a scoop open to everyone. He is simply directed to our website where our raw material is, uniquely, available 24 hours a day. I don't recall Watson offering the rushes of The Fishing Party or The Dinner Party for inspection. </p> <p>Now, what about the gross exhibitionism? \"A boring showcase for exhibitionists\" (the Independent). \"They have that manic, 24-hour-auditioning, I'm-up-for-anything-me hysteria\" (AA Gill, the Sunday Times). Guilty as charged. There's certainly a lot of showing off. I remember a particularly mad schoolmaster who accused any boy who wanted to act in the school play of being a ghastly show-off and threatened to beat him. But no show-offs, no school play. And it is not yet a crime to be an extrovert. Any television presenter, actor or bylined journalist has the same egotistical desire to project and be recognised. There's something unedifying about their pulling up the drawbridge after them once they have made it.</p> <p>Big Brother highlights something fundamental about television. People want to be on it for their 15 minutes of fame. This is neither laudable nor reprehensible. It's just a fact. Big Brother, along with docusoaps, game shows and the rest, offers that opportunity. Television creates cohorts of people who are famous for being famous. Not such a terrible thing. You can rail at it but you might as well howl at the moon.</p> <p>That's all very well, our critics say, but this is Peeping Tom television. Organised voyeurism. Er . . . no, I don't think so. The voyeur spies on people without their knowledge. The Big Brother inmates are there voluntarily with the cameras in full view. Anna (you know, the lesbian and former trainee nun) plays Supertramp's It's Raining Again on her guitar. \"It's hard to pretend,\" she sings. Precisely, Anna. You all know you are being watched and you admit it.</p> <p>Finally there's the social experiment thingy: \"What rankles most about the whole seedy exercise is the pretence that it is some sort of genuine social investigation and not just a cynical drive for ratings and profits.\" (Chris Dunkley, the Financial Times). \"Big Brother apparently pretends to be an experiment . . . Only the fluffiest of couch potatoes can have failed to see through its commercialism.\" (Daniel Johnson, the Daily Telegraph). Steady. We were careful to make no such claim. Big Brother is a challenge, a gameshow with a prize winner, a piece of TV entertainment. True, we include psychologists in our Monday edition. But that is because we want them to analyse the behaviour of the competitors for viewers, not because we want them to publish a treatise. As it happens, they may do so - but that is not why we are making the programme. </p> <p>If the academics do go into print I hope they consider how revealing Big Brother has been about 20- and 30-somethings. They never talk about politics, though they are interested in ethics (witness their animated discussion of George Michael's arrest or their even more animated debate about Nick's illegal notes). They are more interested in new age nostrums such as tarot cards and yoga than in traditional religion. They have few hang-ups about nudity and bodily functions and no hang-ups about so-called bad language. Perhaps Channel 4's presentation department could save time by forewarning us only when there are no naughty words in the nightly slot. How strong is \"strong language\" when it is common parlance for this generation?</p> <p>But back to that unkindest cut of all - that this is a commercial exercise, a drive for ratings and profits. Yes, that is precisely what it is. Journalists do not work for free and they quite like to attract readers. We're in business too. I know the British system of television content regulation means that we are frequently expected to claim higher motives in order to earn brownie points. But some television is there to entertain and earn enough to enable more of the same. \"Cynical\" is the only word I would balk at. I prefer \"realist\".</p> <p>Big Brother is pure television. It uses all the industry's production techniques openly; it caters for participants who simply want to be on television; it satisfies viewers' eternal curiosity about the minutiae of others' characters and relationships; and it is wonderfully entertaining (perhaps the medium's most important function). Disappointing, then, that we Brits can take no credit for it whatsoever. It was invented in the Netherlands by producers who come from an entertainment background. They were unconstrained by the petty deceits and intellectual pretensions that are the currency of the UK television industry. That is how they got closer to the core of what television can do than we are likely to. However, don't accuse me of hyperbole on top of everything else. Big Brother is not the greatest thing since sliced bread. But nor it is the end of civilisation as we know it. It's just a revealing and riveting piece of entertainment.</p> <p>The press, of course, has not been unremittingly hostile. Two weeks ago the Daily Telegraph published a leader supporting the programme. That could destroy the street cred of Ruth Wrigley, Conrad Green and the rest of the Big Brother production team forever. Talk about power without responsibility. </p>",
  "<p>The executive in charge of the Independent and Independent on Sunday titles believes the broadsheets will make a profit next year.</p> <p>Brendan Hopkins was speaking after owners Independent News &amp; Media reported improved first-half figures, buoyed by a rise in circulation and advertising revenues in all its key markets.</p> <p>The Dublin-based publishing, new media and outdoor advertising group boosted pre-tax profits from E61m (\u00a337.3m) to E74.5m (\u00a345.5m), with turnover leaping by 19% to E629.4 (\u00a3384.6m).</p> <p>\"We are very pleased with both the Independent titles,\" said Mr Hopkins. \"We think the venture is a great success and next year we will make profit.

  "<p><strong>Where to bump into Charles Allen</strong><br> Now the juiciest bits of the MacTaggart lecture are routinely leaked to the press in advance, sitting through the showpiece Edinburgh speech is even more of a drag than ever. But for career-minded TV types looking to rub shoulders with the industry's grandest fromages, attendance at this opening event is de rigueur. Queuing for the MacTaggart - or better still, sharing a cab to the after-speech reception - may be the only chance you get to exchange pleasantries with the likes of Charles Allen and Alan Yentob, before they retire to select dinners and exclusive hotel bars with other members of the TV power elite. </p> <p><strong>George Bar myths</strong><br> Nobody ever actually landed that dream job or commission by cornering their quarry in the George bar toilets (unless it was a pitch for a late-night Channel 5 show). Ditto for hanging about in the corridors of the George hotel in the early hours, hoping to catch two people sneaking into a bedroom together who shouldn't have been, for blackmail purposes (though this is not a bad way of proving your aptitude for becoming a head of corporate affairs). Staying up drinking with your new-found TV industry buddies till 6am is not a career-enhancing move. The excruciating noise of glass tinkling against glass, as hundreds of empty bottles are removed from the bar, is one of the most depressing sounds this side of a seal cull. Especially when you're too drunk to remember where your hotel is, let alone the killer question you'd formulated to impress David Liddiment in that all too imminent 10am session. </p> <p><strong>Free booze and sweaty snogs</strong><br> If it's quantity of free alcohol you're after, rather than quality of company to schmooze, check out the official Saturday night festival bash. These are invariably sweaty, overcrowded, dishevelled affairs, and the free booze has always run out when you finally roll up at 9.50pm, after lingering too long in the George over early evening drinkies and then misreading the directions. But to compensate, this is your best opportunity to make new friends, possibly thrusting young hopefuls from TVYP. </p> <p><strong>Stop the festival, I want to get off</strong><br> Fed up with hanging around TV folk all talking up their poxy jobs and shows? For a change of scene - but no let up in the quantity of rampaging egos, or alcohol and other drugs being imbibed - try blagging your way into the numerous Edinburgh Fringe comedy events and drinking haunts. The most highly sought-after comedy-related lig, the annual Paramount Comedy Channel bash, takes place on the Thursday night before the TV festival even starts. But it is an ideal way to limber up for the alcoholic Olympics to come over the weekend. If you fancy being the object of some rapier-tongued abuse from the likes of Mark Lamarr, late nights at the Assembly Rooms bar is the place to be. The Saturday night of TV festival weekend usually also coincides with the Perrier new comedy award winners' party. By Sunday night, the George bar is a place you really don't want to be - the stench of stale booze, fags and egos is overpowering. So why not check out the regular Channel 4-sponsored Sunday night new comedy talent showcase, So You Think You're Funny. If your appetite for free alcohol and uninhibited displays of affection was left unsated by the Saturday night festival do, there may be further opportunities here.</p>",
  "The Spanish poet Jos\u00e9 Angel Valente, who has died aged 71, wrote at two removes from the harsh realities of his homeland; firstly, by living in exile during the Franco era, and secondly by contemplating being and the nature of poetry itself rather than more obvious political themes. <p>Born in Orense, an \"obscure\" town in Galicia, Valente claimed that his biography lay in his poetry, but aspects of his external life aid understanding of his work. The civil war and Franco's dictatorship marked him, especially when his Falangist father fell foul of the regime. There are no yearnings for a return to that childhood in his poems - although he wrote C\u00e1ntigas de al\u00e9n (Songs of long ago, 1989) in Galician. </p> <p>He went on to study law in Santiago de Compostela, and graduated in romance philology at the University of Madrid in 1953, with a prize. From 1955-58 he taught and earned an MA at Oxford; from 1958-75, he translated for the World Health Organisation in Geneva, before moving to Paris, where he worked from 1975-86 for Unesco. </p> <p>After that, he lived between Geneva and Almer\u00eda, with its desert landscapes and the nearby Cabo de Gata national park. His life's work as a poet in self-exile was finally recognised in Spain when he won the prestigious Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias prize in 1988, and then the National Poetry prize in 1993. None of his books has yet been translated into English. Many of those who grew up under Franco became politicised poets, but Valente turned to writing meta-poetry about the inner processes of poetry itself because he was a \"poet in times of misery\" who had to re-think what poetry meant in the corruption of language under Franco. </p> <p>The practice of writing and translating poetry became his self-defence, and path to the enigma of inner knowledge. Franco's shadow drove him into \"poverty and exile\", living in what he called the \"extrapatria\", outside Spain. </p> <p>He published the first of more than 20 books, A modo de esperanza (In hopeful mode, 1955), after winning the Adonais poetry prize; his second book, Poemas a L\u00e1zaro (Poems to Lazarus, 1960), won the Premio de la Critica, and in 1980 he won the prize for the second time with Tres lecciones de tinieblas (Three lessons of Tenebrae). </p> <p>Last year his complete poems, Obra po\u00e9tica, appeared in two volumes. Apart from his poetry, Valente translated and collected his short, acute essays on Spanish mystics and others. He enjoyed collaborating on books with painters such as Eduardo Chillida (a fellow Galician), Antoni T\u00e0pies and Antonio Saura. </p> <p>Over the years, rather than any sudden shifts, there was a pruning of the non-essential, edging towards meditative fragments. His later work requires concentration, is religious in its seeking of a poetic sacred - or better, its continuous absence. Valente emphasises \"not understanding\", a relentless verbal deconditioning, a focusing on \"attentiveness\". This is summarised in a brief 1989 poem: To rub oneself out. / Only in the absence of any sign / does the god land . </p> <p>Valente never courted popularity, wrote outside Hispanic fashions and in-groups, but was considered by writers like Juan Goytisolo to be Spain's most dedicated poet; a poet's poet elaborating an austere ethic of creativity. He exemplified poetic integrity, pushing poetry into terrains that compete with religious, mystical and Heideggerian notions of inner being. His poetry picks up the challenge of the great, acerbic 17th-century writer Francisco de Quevedo; it expands Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez's \"pure poetry\" and Antonio Machado's philosophical colloquialism, and integrates the self-denying, laconic Peruvian, C\u00e9sar Vallejo. </p> <p>From these he learned self-belittlement, direct references and rhythms, and an aesthetics of verbal poverty in the form of a critique of superfluous words, similes and metaphors. His work is contemplative, emanating from the darkness of the solitary self, without ever pandering to the sensual baroque of the Spanish poetic tradition embodied by Lorca and Neruda. </p> <p>In his introspective poetry there are no easy answers, for he denies the possibility of understanding anything. Key terms such as \"to be unaware\", \"emptiness\", \"silence\" and \"loneliness\" convey his constant self-examination; poets are \"divers into emptiness\". In the poem Obituary, we read: In the centre of his heart, the burial mound which he himself had raised with the years remained shut forever . </p> <p>A poem of 1970 could be an epitaph: He performed three exercises / to dissolve his ego, / and on the fourth found himself alone / with his eyes fixed on an answer / that nobody could give him . </p> <p>Many poems explore this inner vacuum, and the lack of references outside the poem itself makes all his work, not anecdotally autobiographical, but the biography of a mind. </p> <p>Valente was twice married, with four children, two of whom predeceased him. </p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Angel Valente, poet, born April 25 1929; died July 18 2000</p>",
  "<p>Panorama, the BBC's flagship current affairs series, is risking renewed accusations of trivialisation by lining up a light entertainment presenter to front a programme about Big Brother-style reality TV shows. </p> <p>As part of the drive to save the programme from falling ratings, Mariella Frostrup is being considered to report on the phenomenon of voyeur TV, which is gaining a cult following with the Channel 4 show.</p> <p>A number of Panorama staff are understood to be irritated that the acting editors, Karen O'Connor and Clive Edwards, are considering an outside presenter, known for her huskily voiced television adverts, for a role usually performed by established names such as Jane Corbin, Tom Mangold and Vivian White. Panorama reporters usually take an active role in the programme they present, and Ms Frostrup has no known background in investigative current affairs. Since the BBC appointed Peter Horrocks as head of current affairs in June the programme has been without a permanent editor. </p> <p>The future of the programme is under review: BBC chiefs want it to be \"heavier hitting\". One edition in the last series scored the worst ratings for any edition of Panorama, and executives have considered moving all but special investigations to BBC2. </p> <p>Following protests, that plan was shelved. Instead, Panorama's budget was increased by \u00a3100,000 and the number of programmes in the series cut, in order to concentrate resources. At the time Mr Horrocks said the investment would \"deliver more original journalism to BBC1 viewers\". </p> <p>The reduction in episodes from 38 to 30 did not represent a \"dumbing down\" of current affairs, the BBC said.</p> <p>Panorama does not have a tradition of employing showbusiness names to present special editions. Some staff are concerned at the direction the programme appears to be taking, especially since this season is regarded as crucial. </p> <p>A BBC spokeswoman said of the plan: \"It is in its early stages of research ... the personnel working on any programme have not been finalised.\"</p>",
  "<p>Well, in a quiet week for the ever-troubled Eminem - who solved at least one of his legion legal problems by finally agreeing joint custody of his daughter with estranged spouse Kim Mathers - thank the Lord for former child star <strong> Brad Renfro </strong>. Because, busy pursuing the traditional kid-actor trajectory of crash and burn, Renfro (last seen alongside Ian McKellen in 1998 clunker Apt Pupil) surpassed himself by being arrested last Monday while attempting to steal a 45-foot yacht from a Fort Lauderdale dock. </p> <p>According to local police, Renfro and a friend, one Harold Bond, were apprehended at 3.40am in the midst of making off to sea after fellow boaters alerted the cops to the sound of engines; sadly for Renfro, neither he nor his accomplice had remembered to untie the ropes binding the ship to dock, leaving themselves stranded onboard as the law arrived. Paul Roydhouse, owner of the yacht in question, described Renfro as being \"distraught\" at his subsequent arrest, although police department spokesman Mike Reed admitted he soon turned \"evasive\" upon formal questioning at the station. The actor was subsequently released on bail of $10,000 pending the results of drug and alcohol tests, the next stage of what is sure to be a lengthy and mordantly entertaining judicial process. </p> <p>Not that Renfro, who only celebrated his 18th birthday last month, is a stranger to the beak: in 1998, he was arrested in his home town of Knoxville, Tennessee, after police pulled him over and found packets of cocaine and marijuana in his socks and underwear. At the time, Renfro agreed to undergo random drug testing as part of a plea bargain with the prosecutors, all of which bodes ill for the lad should anything untoward turn up in his sample this time round_</p>",
  "<p>Every summer the scene is the same. The chief inspector of schools nervously waits for the exam results. The letter lands on the doormat. His parents stand over him as he opens the envelope. </p> <p>\"Well, dear, what does it say?\" </p> <p>\"Oh no,\" says Chris, completely mortified, \"200,000 grades As. The best results ever!\" ...and he bursts into tears of disappointment. </p> <p>\"Never mind, dear. Maybe some of them could do re-takes and try to get lower grades.\" But it's too late, Chris has already run up to his room, slammed the door and put on Radiohead at full volume. </p> <p>It strikes me as completely bizarre that our chief inspector of schools is concerned that the number of grade As at A-level are too high. \"An education system must involve failure,\" he said in the Guardian on Monday. \"Life involves failure.\" Life also involves illness and injustice, but that doesn't mean we should give all our kids malaria and put them in prison for the Great Train Robbery. Perhaps Chris Woodhead ought to be appointed the manager of the England football team. \"I am delighted with the way the lads threw away a 2-0 lead over Portugal. Fingers crossed, we now have every prospect of being knocked out of Euro 2000 in the first stage.\" </p> <p>The subtext of his \"A-levels are too easy\" message is: \"Ooh, it were harder in our day. Because these young kids today, they don't know they're born. When I were a lad, you couldn't just point a remote control at the telly, you had to get off the sofa, walk all the way across the room and press a button next to the screen. Aye, and you couldn't just listen to an album all the way through, no - you had to get up and turn it over. Boy, did we have it tough.\" </p> <p>A-level results are higher because students and teachers are doing better. Mightn't it be more appropriate to give some credit where it is due, instead of undermining the achievement of all involved? More athletes can run the four-minute mile, but we don't say: \"Yes, well miles are much shorter than they used to be.\" I never got a grade A in any exam I ever took, I even managed an \"unclassified\" in my metalwork O-level. What Chris Woodhead is saying is that we need more results like this. So English students should be encouraged to describe the poetry of Shakespeare based on their readings of Brodies' Notes. History students should revise half of the syllabus, so they have to begin A-level essays by saying: \"When examining the reasons for the Repeal of the Corn Laws it is interesting to look at the causes of the American revolution.\" </p> <p>The alternative of making A-levels harder would be grossly unfair on anyone who ended up failing an exam which they would have passed a few years earlier. They would compete for the same jobs as slightly older candidates who were no brighter but seemed to have better qualifications. Maybe the solution is to follow the Scottish example and just lose the exam results altogether. </p> <p>The real problem with our education system is the same as it always was. School involves spending years learning stuff we never use again. To get my maths O-level for example, I spent two years grappling with the most impossible mathematical problem of all time: \"What is the point of slide rules? Logarithms, quadratic equations, matrices?\" I eventually understood all of them, but while a cheap pocket calculator was burning a hole in my pocket, I failed to solve the impossible mathematical conundrum of \"Slide rules: why?\" </p> <p>And so now, instead of teaching our children about oxbow lakes and the Whig hegemony, we should be teaching them stuff they can use when they get to our age. How to get peppercorns into the pepper grinder, for example. A-level eating spaghetti in a white shirt. GCSE Staying Awake during Nationwide Football League Review. How to say \"No thank you\" to squeegee merchants in a way that they will take any notice. How to open a door for someone which opens away from you. There are hundreds of skills that most of us still haven't mastered. </p> <p>And just as our education should better prepare us for adulthood, so the Ofsted regime of regular inspection should be extended to our life after school. When Trevor Macdonald reads out the evening news, there should be someone sitting behind him, tutting slightly and making notes whenever he mispronounces Slobodan Milosevic. When air stewardesses have finished giving the safety instructions before take off, they should be told that they were failing to engage the passengers in an exciting and challenging way. Even Chris Woodhead should not be immune. An inspector from \"Of-ofsted\" should observe him for a week or so and if he was deemed to be failing then it should be reported to chief inspector of schools. And after his comments this week, surely he'd have to close himself down. </p> <p>\u0095 John O'Farrell's new novel, The Best a Man Can Get, is published by Doubleday on October 6. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">mailto:comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "In the years before he was plucked from the French dole queue to save the Millennium Dome, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau's job at Disneyland Paris was to look after children, who like Alice, were lost in Wonderland. <p>Last night, as the dome got an extra \u00a347m to add to the magic mountain of cash already lavished on the Mad Hatter's tea party at Greenwich, it was he who seemed a little lost. </p> <p>Demoted and humiliated, having lost overall financial control to the troubleshooter David James, the previously unflappable Frenchman was struggling to summon the boundless optimism with which he has greeted each new disaster at the dome. This being the through-the-looking-glass-world of the New Millennium Experience Company, however, Mr Gerbeau's Cheshire Cat smile was still intact as he insisted the dome would make its much revised 7m visitor target. </p> <p>It is now traditional on days when the dome is bailed out for Mr Gerbeau to give assurances he will not ask for any more money. There were no such assurances yesterday. Tellingly, he disappeared before journalists had a chance to question him. Asked if he had run off, Mr James said: \"Embarrassment and PY are not two expressions I would put in the same sentence.\" </p> <p>If the dome does manage to stay open until December without more subsidies - and dome insiders are sceptical about that - it will have cost a staggering \u00a3937m. Few, however, expect it to come in under a billion. </p> <p>As the calls for its early closure grew louder last night, its original chief executive Jennie Page and chairman Bob Ayling, whose own brilliant careers were cut short by the debacle, could be forgiven for counting their blessings that they were kicked out so soon. </p> <p>There were no such wry smiles at the Millennium Commission, which voiced its \"deep disappointment\" at having to dole out another \u00a347m loan yesterday to add to the \u00a3132m it already has poured into the \"black hole\" that is the dome's finances. The meeting which decided that the dome should struggle on was chaired by the culture secretary Chris Smith, who is widely believed to have been against the enterprise from the start. His fears that the dome had the potential to become an own goal rather than a vote catcher for Labour have been proved right. However, he was overruled by Peter Mandelson, John Prescott and the prime minister himself, who was swayed by Simon Jenkins, the journalist and grandee who chairs the Millennium Commission. </p> <p>In what has become known as the \"Euan letter\", Mr Jenkins promised the prime minister that the dome would be something his eldest son would be able to tell his children about. Jenkins' prediction may yet hold true - although Mr Blair's children have yet to visit the Dome - but for all the wrong reasons. </p> <p>Last night the commission made no attempts to disguise the depth of the crisis. In a statement shortly after the extra money was released, it said: \"In considering the application, the commission has had to recognise that without extra grant, the NMEC would have gone into immediate liquidation and the dome would have had to close. Outstanding creditors, including many small businesses, would have gone unpaid, around 2,000 jobs would have been lost, and thousands of people who have already booked would have been unable to visit.\" In agreeing to make the extra cash available, it wanted a complete reorganisation of NMEC's fi nancial management. It said the troubleshooting team headed by Mr James \"has clear instructions to take what steps it can to reduce as far as possible the final call on lottery funds\". </p> <p>But last night the question being asked was why, in the face of incontrovertible evidence of the dome's financial failure, it has taken so long for the commission to demand such a root and branch overhaul. </p> <p>The dome stared bankruptcy in the face as long ago as May 22 when Mr Gerbeau famously \"put a gun to the head of the commission\" and demanded an extra \u00a345m to add to the \u00a360m he negotiated to push through his rescue package in March. He got \u00a329m. </p> <p>Even as the first of that money was being spent, Mr Gerbeau said he had \"fixed the dome\" and all he needed to do now was overcome the negative publicity he claimed had unfairly undermined it.He also vowed he would not \"ask the commission for any more handouts. We are turning the dome round,\" he declared. At that time, the NMEC dismissed rumours that it owed its suppliers as much as \u00a310m as \"nonsense\". The true figure, they said, was around \u00a31m. Today it emerged they owe suppliers around \u00a315m. </p> <p>By August, despite his repeated assurances to the contrary, Mr Gerbeau was back asking for more money. The extra \u00a343m this time - which came from the sale of the site to the Japanese bank Nomura - was not a \"handout\", he maintained, but a loan which would be paid back. The \u00a329m shelled out in May was also a loan which the media has \"misinterpreted\" as a grant. \"We have never used the word grant,\" a NMEC spokesman explained. </p> <p>Whatever the semantics, as the new supremo Mr James yesterday made clear, there was never any likelihood of these \"loans\" being paid back. The Alice In Wonderland accounting was not just Mr Gerbeau's. Right from the beginning, the dome's balance sheet was an exercise in wishful thinking. As the flamboyant Frenchman himself memorably put it, the projected 12m visitors on which its precarious financial equilibrium was based was \"pure fairyland. It was a fantasy. Crazy, crazy, what can I say?\" Mr Gerbeau's first priority when he replaced Jennie Page in January was to lower expec tations. Visitor targets were revised down to 10m then fell further to 7m. But with the dome dependent on ticket sales to keep going, and Mr Gerbeau's ability to slash costs severely limited, it was always going to lumber from one calamity to the next. </p> <p>The manner of his appointment itself came to symbolise the hamfisted management and political interference which dogged the project. The minister for the dome, Lord Falconer, was behind grandiose claims that Mr Gerbeau had been the man who had turned around Disneyland Paris, when in fact he was just an ambitious young middle manager there earning around \u00a335,000 a year. </p> <p>As visitors numbers continued to fall hopelessly below the revised figures - they trailed targets by 4,000 a day even in their best month - and heavy discounting made no real dent in the deficit, Mr Gerbeau's souffle of bombast and bonhomie eventually fell flat. </p> <p>With the indications clear last night that the latest \u00a347m injection will not be enough to tide the dome over, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, Norman Baker, said the government must come clean on the costs of closing the attraction early. \"Those figures need to be put in the public arena now. This grim pantomime cannot go on,\" he said. \"We can't have a succession of blank cheques being written behind closed doors. How much lottery money are we supposed to waste to save ministers face?\" Even Mr James, who was approached four weeks ago, seemed to suggest that the dome could be closed early for around \u00a340m, with much of the staff being transferred to Nomura, who are due to take over on January 1. Others have predicted the cost of closure between \u00a350m and \u00a360m. </p> <p>Government sources last month talked about a \"line in the sand\" being drawn when the dome received its last handout. That phrase was again being used last night. It remains to be seen how seriously it should be taken this time. </p> <p>\u0095 The head of Germany's Expo 2000 said yesterday that the country's first attempt to stage the world fair had been a financial disaster, with visitor figures a fraction of those forecast. With projected losses soaring to 2.4bn marks (\u00a3650m), six times the original forecast, \"the financial side has been catastrophic\", Expo chief Birgit Breuel told West German radio.The fair is now hoping to attract a total of 14m visitors, far below its 40m original forecast.</p>",
  "If there were even a smidgen of doubt left that the Millennium Dome is in trouble, it would have been dispelled with the appointment of David James as the third chairman in its brief life. <p>Mr James, 62, is one of the most high profile \"company doctors\" in the City, hauled in by the banks to salvage something from the wreckage of corporate disasters when all else has failed. </p> <p>He is well used to what are known in the square mile as basket cases and has overseen the break up of the British Shoe Company, the rescue and subsequent sale of airline Dan Air, and the winding up of conglomerate Eagle Trust. </p> <p>During his chairmanship of Eagle Trust he enjoyed his most notable brush with fame, after stumbling upon development of the Iraqi supergun. </p> <p>During a visit to one of the company's subsidiaries in 1990 he noticed three steel pipes one of which looked \"like a thumping great muzzle, just like a cartoon representation of a siege gun\". He made inquiries and reported his findings, the first tangible evidence that part of the gun was being built in Britain, to M16. </p> <p>Mr James is unlikely to be phased by the criticisms which will undoubtedly come his way in taking on the much derided dome. Another colourful episode in his career gave him a ringside seat in Tripoli at the US bombing raid on Libya, where he was trying to negotiate the release of a dozen of his staff working in the region who had been taken hostage. </p> <p>In his first job he spent five years at Lloyds Bank before joining the launch team of the credit arm of Ford. </p> <p>In 1973 he joined accountancy firm Cork Gully where he played a role in the rescue of a company called Cedar Holdings. This acted as a springboard to his career as a company doctor, although he prefers the title of \"crisis manager\". </p> <p>He went on to play a bruising role in the closure of a number of manufacturing businesses during the 1970s and 80s where he faced running battles with workers. </p> <p>Mr James, who is also a member of the monitoring and investigations committee for Lloyd's of London, was awarded the CBE in 1992. He is the only child of a caterer father and unmarried. It is little surprise that Mr James has had offers from publishers to write his life story. The dome, which he has said will be a \"hands on\" job, could provide an intriguing epilogue.</p>",

  "The complicated and emotive issue of whether an operation to separate Siamese twins Jodie and Mary would amount to the unlawful killing of the weaker sister was raised in the appeal court yesterday. <p>Several times during the hearing one of the three judges, Lord Justice Brooke, held up a photograph of the babies and asked how the operation could be carried out without an \"invasion\" of Mary's body. </p> <p>The parents of the girls are appealing against a high court ruling that the operation should go ahead even though it will lead to the death of Mary, who relies on her sister for blood and oxygen. </p> <p>On Monday the judges ordered that a second opinion be sought on the conclusions of the doctors at St Mary's hospital in Manchester, where the children are being cared for. </p> <p>Yesterday a surgeon and paediatric cardiologist from Great Ormond Street hospital were examining the twins. Jodie and Mary - false names to protect their identity - were born at St Mary's on August 8, joined at the lower abdomen and sharing one working heart and set of lungs. </p> <p>The Manchester doctors believe that Jodie could lead a full and active life if she is separated, but acknowledge that the operation would result in Mary's death. If no operation takes place, they are convinced that both would die. The parents, strict Catholics who came to Britain from a remote European community, insist that nature should take its course. </p> <p>Yesterday Judith Parker QC said that if there was a \"lawful way\" of performing the operation, the case for performing it in Jodie's interests was \"overwhelming\". Responding to a question about \"the best interests\" of Mary, she argued: \"We say there are no best interests in preserving what is unfortunately a futile life.\" </p> <p>The court focused attention on the criminal law aspects of the case, which have been described as \"astonishingly difficult\". Lord Justice Ward said: \"The moment the knife goes in to that united body, it touches the body of unhappy little Mary. It is in that second an assault. You fiddle about, rearrange the plumbing. An hour later you put a clamp on the aorta [cutting off the blood supply to Mary]. You cannot pretend that is not actively engaged in assaulting her integrity. For what justification? None of hers.\" </p> <p>The judge said the parents could arguably be guilty of the manslaughter of Jodie if they did not act, but guilty of the manslaughter of Mary if they allowed the separation. </p> <p>Asked whether Jodie and Mary should be regarded as \"one life\" in the legal sense - which could help to clear the way for an operation to save Jodie - Simon Taylor, for the parents, said that doctors and nurses at St Mary's considered the twins as separate individuals. </p> <p>The judges also queried whether Mary had, in fact, been \"born alive\", given that she depended on her twin for her continuing existence. Mr Taylor said: \"Maybe she is relying on her sister, but nevertheless she was born alive.\"</p>",
  "<p>Nuclear waste should be dumped in domestic rubbish tips to save money so hospitals can use more radioactive sources to diagnose and treat patients, according to a government safety watchdog. </p> <p>Patients may be denied treatment for such illnesses as cancer because hospitals are having to spend as much as \u00a3100,000 to dispose of a single item, the committee says. </p> <p>The report by the radioactive waste management advisory committee says: \"Small reductions in radiation exposure of the public are so expensive to achieve that the benefit is outweighed by the cost.\" </p> <p>Hospitals have to dispose of swabs, vials, syringes, gloves, dressings, and overalls as well as x-ray machines and chemotherapy machines at the nation's one low level radioactive dump operated by British Nuclear Fuels at Drigg in Cumbria. </p> <p>Small users, as they are known, \"discharge more small short lived liquid radioative waste to the environment than the nuclear operators,\" according to the report. </p> <p>Hospitals, universities and research labs, all of which use extensive quantities of radioactive materials have to encase their waste in concrete and transport it to Cumbria. </p> <p>Once there the cost of disposal can be as little as between \u00a3200 and \u00a32,000 a tonne depending on the content, but the expense of packaging and transport has to be borne by the waste producer. </p> <p>The RWMAC report says 72 hospitals were surveyed for its report and many of them reported a backlog of items like radium needles used in past treatments kept in stores for which they had no disposal budget. To get rid of the material they would have to find funds by stopping treatment of patients. </p> <p>Charles Curtis, chairman of the committee, said it was often forgotten that radioactive materials were used extensively in hospitals, universities, and such things as smoke alarms. </p> <p>\"The benefits to the public are immense, but the difficulties experienced by these small users, particularly dealing with radioactive wastes, should not be underestimated.\" </p> <p>The committee, the government's official adviser on waste policy, says money should be specifically allocated to the national health service and higher education sectors to allow effective management of waste. </p> <p>\"Quite large numbers of [radioactive] sources, have had to be retained on premises long after their useful life has ended because of the currently high cost of ensuring their safe disposal.\" </p> <p>The alternative is for the government to set up a suitably funded body to collect and dispose of these sources, a system that operates successfully in France. </p> <p>To prevent the situation getting worse in the future, the committee recommended that the cost of the ultimate disposal of radioactive sources should be covered by the purchase price at the outset. Safe disposal in domestic rubbish tips is likely to cause local objections. </p> <p>But the committee says that in properly regulated dumps the extra dose to the public would be about 1% of the average that everyone in the UK receives every day from natural background sources. </p> <p>Unlike plutonium and other long lived materials from the nuclear industry, which last for thousands of years, technetium-99m, the most widely used isotope in medicine, begins to lose its radioactivity within hours. </p> <p>The committee said that compulsion on private to take low-level nuclear waste might not be necessary, but the government should make sure that such facilities were available. This would represent a large national saving in waste disposal costs for the 5,600 registered small users of radioactivity, and extend the life of the Drigg respository, which is rapidly filling up.</p>",
  "On the eve of a last attempt by President Clinton to untangle the most vexing problem in the Middle East - the status of Jerusalem - one of Yasser Arafat's most trusted lieutenants said yesterday the Palestinians would be willing to make bold compromises on their claims to the holy city. <p>In a speech to the European parliament in Strasbourg, Ahmed Qureia said the Palestinians would support internationalising all of Jerusalem - including Arab East Jerusalem, occupied illegally by Israel since 1967 - should the two sides fail to reach a final settlement in the crucial weeks ahead. </p> <p>\"Unless we can reach an agreement on Jerusalem, I have to declare that both parts of Jerusalem east and west should be a unified international Jerusalem ... not just the capital of Israel or Palestine, but a capital of the world,\" said Mr Qureia, who is speaker of the Palestinian parliament. </p> <p>The proposal revives a formula put forward by the UN in 1947 and since repeatedly rejected by Israel, and opposed by the Palestinians, though it still remains part of European foreign policy. </p> <p>President Clinton is to begin talks today with Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and Mr Arafat, meeting each separately on the sidelines of the millennium summit in New York. </p> <p>The meetings at the Waldorf Astoria have caused some to hope that during the hubbub of the three-day summit of 150 world leaders, Mr Clinton will somehow produce the miracle that eluded him in two weeks of concentrated negotiations at Camp David last July. </p> <p>Mr Clinton has likened the experience of those talks to having teeth extracted without painkillers, and strongly criticised Mr Arafat for his unwillingness to match Israeli compromises on Jerusalem. </p> <p>Some Palestinians hope that yesterday's proposal from such a senior figure as Mr Qureia, popularly known as Abu Ala and seen as a possible successor to the ailing Mr Arafat - could relieve some of the pressure on the Palestinian leader during his New York talks. </p> <p>\"He said it to try to throw forward an idea that would be acceptable among Europeans and internationally,\" said Nabil Khatib, director of the media centre of Bir Zeit University in the West Bank town of Ramallah. </p> <p>\"The Palestinians have a feeling that Israel is trying to give the impression that they [the Israelis] are the only ones who are making concessions. Abu Ala is trying to show that the Palestinian people are also ready for concessions, but not one-sided, and not concessions to Israel. The concession is to have a new kind of solution.\" </p> <p>Accepting current Israeli proposals on Jerusalem, which would restrict Palestinian sovereignty to a few outer neighbourhoods of the city, would be impossible for Mr Arafat to justify to his people. </p> <p>\"Mr Barak wants everyone to comply with his version of how things should be: occupiers' law,\" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian legislative council. \"But the issue is not just the holy sites, the issue is Jerusalem as a city.\" Real solutions were needed, not just symbolic ones. </p> <p>Mr Clinton is to use the meetings with Mr Arafat and Mr Barak to see whether to hold a second summit, possibly in October. But American officials say they first need to see signs of further progress since July's Camp David talks. \"Unless there is forward progress, unless we see a decisive way forward from this week ... this [reaching a deal] gets more and more difficult,\" the US national security adviser, Sandy Berger told reporters. </p> <p>So far signs of progress do not appear forthcoming. Israeli and Palestinian officials have tried to dampen expectations of a breakthrough before September 13, the latest deadline for a final settlement. </p> <p>Israeli officials say it is up to Mr Arafat to react to proposals since Camp David which blur the issue of sovereignty over the holy places in the old walled city of Jerusalem. \"Arafat's moment of truth has come and the Palestinian leader must make political decisions rather than turn the negotiations into a bickering match,\" the Israeli foreign ministry said on Monday. </p> <p>Instead, they are trying to press Mr Arafat to accept a dispensation for Jerusalem, offered since Camp David, that would dodge the question of ownership over the sanctified ground in the old walled city by declaring God the sovereign of holy places. </p> <p>The US version of these proposals would have Israel controlling the Wailing Wall, the holiest shrine of Judaism, and the Palestinians in control of the Haram al-Sharif, the third holiest site in Islam, with God the sovereign of the passage between them. </p> <p>Mr Arafat has come under mounting pressure from the US and Israel to accept the proposals, which are endorsed by Egypt and Jordan. After the last Camp David talks ended without agreement, Mr Arafat went to more than two dozen countries looking for support but found himself being urged to hold off on declaring a Palestinian state on September 13. On that, Mr Arafat appears to have yielded, and a meeting of Palestinian legislators in Gaza at the weekend is likely to support postponing such a declaration until later in the year. \"September 13 is not a sacred date,\" said Faruq Qaddumi, a senior Palestinian official. </p> <p>But time is working against a settlement. The US presidential election campaign is expected to occupy much of Mr Clinton's energy from now until the vote in November, and Mr Barak is barely hanging on to power. Stripped of a parliamentary majority, his government is surviving thanks to the summer recess in the Israeli knesset. </p> <p>If Mr Barak fails to reach a deal with Mr Arafat, he may resort to a new coalition with the rightwing Likud party, which opposes the compromises he offered at Camp David. Yesterday Mr Barak was hedging his bets, telephoning the Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, from New York even as he awaited today's meeting with Mr Clinton.</p>",
  "For months Angelica Ramirez hoped against hope that the changes in her body were caused by the shock of the rape. Eventually, when she could fool herself no more, alone and frightened, she tried to induce an abortion. <p>\"I thought if I don't eat, it will die. I thought if I do the exercises and take pills and special herbs I will abort the baby, but nothing worked. Nothing happened.\" </p> <p>Desperate, she approached a doctor, who agreed to do the operation. But she could not afford his fee; so, with her mother's help, she left her small-town home to have the baby in a city orphanage, so that her father would not find out. </p> <p>\"I know it's not the child's fault, but every night I ask the baby why it had to be born, why I had to have it. That's why I want to give it up for adoption. That's why I don't want the baby ever to know that I am its mother,\" she said, a shy teenager shaking in a failed attempt to control her tears. </p> <p>The taboo that led her to pretend her pregnancy was not happening has deterred politicians on all sides from touching the abortion issue. </p> <p>Women's groups estimate that 850,000 Mexican women abort every year, and about 1,000 are thought to die from botched jobs. These statistics do not even recognise cases such as Angelica's. </p> <p>But in the past few months Mexico has been taken by storm by a national debate on unwanted pregnancies and abortion which, although begun by the religious right - newly emboldened by its links to the president elect Vincente Fox's National Action party (Pan) - has given the pro-choice camp a public platform it was previously denied. </p> <p>\"We have the opportunity to do something different,\" said Ricardo Sheffield, one of the Pan deputies who passed an amendment to the penal code in the state of Guanajuato designed to make abortion, even in cases of rape, punishable with prison. </p> <p>\"The damage of rape can be repaired, but killing by abortion - there is no resolving that.\" </p> <p>Rosario Taracena, an activist for reproductive rights, said the extreme right posed a very real threat, but the feminist movement had long been pushing for the chance to talk openly about abortion and the restrictive laws and cultural taboos which ensured that the most abortions were performed in secret. </p> <p>The Guanajuato bill caused a furore, not only because rape is one of the very few conditions under which abortion is legal in all Mexican states but also because it brought to the surface the deep contradiction between Mexico's Catholic sensibilities and its strong anti-clerical tradition, which abhors mixing religion and politics. </p> <p>It also came soon after the case of Paulina, a 13-year-old rape victim whose attempt to get a legal abortion was blocked by politicians, lawyers and doctors in the northern state of Baja California ,where the Pan is also very strong. The case was given extensive and sympathetic treatment by Mexico's main television network, Televisa. </p> <p>It also deeply embarrassed Mr Fox. A previous governor of the particularly religious state, he had worked hard to distance himself from Pan's rightwing image. But his victory breathed new life into the fundamentalists in the party. </p> <p>The new aggressiveness of the pro-lifers prompted left-leaning parties to pass liberalising amendments to the abortion laws of Mexico City and the state of Morelos. Although hardly radical, they indicated a readiness to pick up the gauntlet thrown down by the extreme right in Pan. </p> <p>Under pressure to calm the situation, the governor of Guanajuato, a close associate of Mr Fox, vetoed the reform at the end of last month. But the state's deputies have vowed to raise the issue again at a later date. </p> <p>\"The debate has only just begun,\" s Mr Sheffield said. \"Mr Fox says this will go no further, but he is not a congressman. We have been raised as opposition, and it is in our blood.\" </p> <p>\"It was to be expected that the religious right would do something like this,\" said Edgar Gonzalez, a researcher, who stressed that the Pan, founded in 1939, had its roots in the Cristera war 10 years earlier between a reactionary church and the new revolutionary anti-clerical state. </p> <p>Pan has broadened its appeal over theyears, but Mr Gonzalez said the fundamentalists had remained, awaiting the right opportunity to push their agenda. </p> <p>\"There is nothing to indicate that they are going to give up so easily now,\"he said </p> <p>There is also nothing to suggest that those who want women to be free to chose abortion will simply accept a quiet return to the status quo. </p> <p>\"What we want is for the debate to continue until we get a national referendum,\" said Veronica Cruz, a leading Guanajuato feminist, encouraged but not satisfied by the veto of the rape reform bill. </p> <p>Meanwhile nobody doubts that whatever the law says, women will seek out ways to abort. For those with money and contacts it can be as simple as a visit to a discrete doctor, but for many it is a matter of noxious concoctions and sharp objects. </p> <p>And it is business as usual in Mexico City's Sonora market. </p> <p>\"How many weeks?\" a vendor asked to gauge the required dose of a herbal remedy he promised would start the bleeding within five hours. </p> <p>\"I only sell to women who are up to three months late, after that it gets dangerous, but for enough money you can always get someone to help you out.\"</p>",
  "A human rights worker investigating massacres by the Guatemalan army during the country's civil war has been kidnapped, drugged, beaten and interrogated about his inquiries. <p>The attack coincided with attempts to prosecute former presidents and military leaders responsible for the mass killing of villagers suspected by the army of helping guerrillas during the 36-year war, which had claimed up to 200,000 lives when it ended in 1996.</p> <p>Celso Balan, 38, who works for the Centre for Legal Action on Human Rights (CALDH) in Guatemala, was seized at the beginning of August. He made a confidential complaint to the United Nations mission, Minigua, shortly after the attack.</p> <p>Mr Balan, who has worked for CALDH for four years, was walking towards the local court-house when two men pulled up in a pick-up and called him by name, a CALDH spokesman said. They said that they were journalists, showed him press cards, and offered him a lift. Once in the truck he was forced to the floor at gunpoint and driven off.</p> <p>The two men questioned him about the exhumation of a mass grave where an army massacre occurred in the village of Chipastor in 1982.</p> <p>He was then forced to take his attackers to the CALDH office, where he was hit over the head with the butt of a gun while the two men ransacked the room for information.</p> <p>Before being dumped in the local cemetery, Mr Balan was forced to drink a liquid containing a strong sedative, which, doctors say, could have produced paralysis or even death in a slightly stronger dose.</p> <p>Mr Balan has promised to continue his work.</p> <p>CALDH is the leading organisation behind an attempt to prosecute the former president Romeo Lucas Garcia and others for war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p> <p>In a separate action, the Nobel peace laureate Rigoberta Menchu is attempting to have the former president Efrain Rios Montt prosecuted in Spain.</p>",
  "The German police said yesterday that they had seized 7,500 CDs in their first strike against one of the most visible - and audible - manifestations of eastern Germany's neo-Nazi youth culture: race-hate rock. <p>Some of the discs impounded during raids in the hours before dawn had cover photographs of Adolf Hitler. Others had pictures of hanged Turks. </p> <p>On one a group sang about killing blacks. \"You've got 30 seconds to run for your life, nigger,\" the lyric ran. Then, after the sound of a machine gun, the group continued: \"Oh. That feels good. That feels good - to kill a nigger.\" </p> <p>Last week a court in the eastern city of Halle convicted three young neo-Nazis of beating and kicking a Mozambique-born immigrant so savagely in June that he died of his injuries. </p> <p>Alberto Adriano was the latest victim of the kind of far-right barbarity which Germany's centre-left government has said it is determined to stamp out. But the scale of the task it has set itself was underlined by some of the details released yesterday by the police. </p> <p>They said they had disrupted the activities of two distributors of far-right rock music in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, but that between 50 to 70 others were still operating in other parts of Germany. There is also a flourishing cross-border trade in neo-Nazi CDs put on sale in Poland. </p> <p>The government's main initiative so far has been to announce that it will be applying for a ban on the most radical of Germany's legal rightwing groups, the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD). It has also promoted a campaign urging ordinary people to stand up to the extreme right. </p> <p>Experts in the field, including sociologists, voluntary workers and officials of Germany's internal intelligence service, have all argued that the true problem is a rejectionist skinhead culture, which is particularly prevalent in the formerly communist east. </p> <p>The sort of music sought in the raids reported yesterday is an important underpinning of that culture, and Saxony-Anhalt is the part of the east where the culture seems to be most embedded. </p> <p>It has the highest rate of violent and far-right crime, and the capital, Magdeburg, is one of the few cities in Germany where extreme rightwingers have seats in the council chamber. </p> <p>The raids occurred last week, but the police said they had held back details until yesterday because the investigation was continuing. They said they had swooped on 11 locations in the early hours of August 30. </p> <p>The confiscated items included computers with mailing lists of customers, videos and posters showing swastikas, and neo-Nazi paraphernalia. They said the material clearly violated German laws prohibiting the incitement of racial hatred and the use of emblems linked with anti-constitutional movements. But only one arrest was made. The suspect was later released on bail of 25,000 marks (\u00a38,400). </p> <p>The army, which has been struggling to stamp out racism in its ranks, said earlier that it was investigating a non-commissioned officer suspected of making racist remarks. The tabloid daily Bild had reported that a staff sergeant was accused of sending messages to the cellphone of a recruit of Turkish origin. </p> <p>One read: \"When Ali is swinging from the oak tree, when Mehmet staggers through the gas chamber, when the swastika is once again used to tar our streets, that's when Germany will be worth living in again.\"</p>",
  "Journey times on England's main roads are unlikely to improve over the next 10 years -despite the \u00a31.2bn plan to curb congestion announced yesterday. <p>The best motorists can hope for is that travel times on England's motorways and trunk roads will be no longer than they are today, Richard Eastman, the highways agency's new technology project director for roads, admitted. \"I don't think journeys will be faster over the next 10 years.\" </p> <p>The admission came as the agency announced measures to improve traffic management and provide better information for drivers as part of the government's \u00a3180bn, 10-year transport strategy. </p> <p>New technology will also be introduced in an attempt to reduce congestion - although the agency admitted it lacked the staff to implement the hi- tech plans. But they would be found, it promised. </p> <p>The agency hopes congestion will be reduced by 5% over 10 years - in contrast to the estimated rise of 28% - but journeys are not expected to take any less time because of increasing volume of traffic. </p> <p>Among the plans announced were the installation of traffic automatic hold-up warning systems on 30% of all motorways by 2004 to reduce pile-ups; and 200 extra motorway monitoring cameras to help emergency services respond more quickly. Variable message signs on national roads will be tripled to 1,500 by 2003, to suggest alternative routes and avoid delays. </p> <p>A national control centre will give more reliable journey times - and offer alternative route advice; and the M25 controlled motorway project will be extended, with controlled motorways on routes around Manchester and Birmingham.</p>",
  "Employers came under renewed pressure to protect workers from passive smoking yesterday when the health and safety executive approved a code of practice. <p>The code spells out a number of steps businesses can take to ensure non-smokers breathe clean air in offices, shops and factories, ranging from improving ventilation to setting aside smoking rooms. </p> <p>The guidelines flesh out the existing legislation which requires employers to safeguard the welfare of their staff. </p> <p>Failing to abide by the code of practice will not be an offence in itself, but would leave an employer vulnerable in a court case. </p> <p>However, pubs and clubs will be exempt from the provisions of the code. Instead, the hospitality industry has been asked to sign up to the public places charter, a voluntary agreement which encourages introduction of no-smoking zones. </p> <p>Anti-smoking campaigners said the new rules were \"good news\" for an estimated 3m non-smokers exposed to tobacco smoke at work. </p> <p>A spokesman for the HSE said the code stopped short of a total workplace ban, and would leave employers the right to work out the solution that suited them. </p> <p>However, Simon Clark, director of the smokers' rights group Forest, said: \"If you don't want to work in a smoky atmosphere, don't work in a pub, work at McDonald's.\" </p> <p>Forest also fears the code might encourage discrimination against smokers at job interviews. </p> <p><b>Useful links:</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/hsehome.htm\" target=\"_new\">HSE</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.ash.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Action on Smoking and Health</a> <br><a href=\"http://forest-on-smoking.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Forest</a></p>"
