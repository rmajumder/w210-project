  "<p><strong> 1: </strong> Look concerned. Prime Minister Tony Blair adopted a suitably po-faced demeanour last week to demonstrate his understanding of the oil crisis. He avoided the mistake of one of his predecessors: a nonchalant Jim Callaghan, seemingly unruffled by a previous oil crisis, provoked the famous Sun headline 'Crisis? What crisis?' Similarly, Vladimir Putin has been slated by the Russian press for continuing his holiday during the failed Kursk rescue attempts last month. </p> <p><strong> 2: </strong> Make sure it is somebody else's fault, advises James, a former civil servant. A long list of people are being blamed for the various Dome fiascos. A major leading the soldiers who were rescued this month in Sierra Leone is being disciplined for letting them be taken hostage in the first place. 'It's usually best to have one person to blame,' James adds, 'preferably someone who is intrinsically unpopular anyway.' This is why, for instance, politicians launch the occasional attack on fat cat barristers, suggesting that their greed is the reason why people cannot afford to go to law. </p> <p><strong> 3:</strong> Take action and appoint people to carry it out. People will usually feel better trying to fight their way out of a situation than simply waiting for doom. One of the worst aspects of the Kursk disaster was the dithering that occurred before the Russians decided to ask for help from Norway and Britain. </p> <p>In most crises, people will be reassured if the head of operations seems to have a clear action plan and sense of direction. You will usually help calm nerves if you keep others busy, too. This can create a positive feeling of teamwork - a far better background hum than frustration and hand-wringing. </p> <p><strong> 4:</strong> Understand the huge impact of any information you give out. Panic buying and runs on banks are caused by a sudden eruption of fear among consumers. Last week's queues at petrol stations showed how quickly millions of people will act if they suspect a shortage of a necessity. </p> <p>Information management was another grossly inept aspect of the Kursk story. Hopes were raised and then dashed when it was wrongly suggested that most of the crew could have survived after the first few minutes. </p> <p><strong> 5: </strong> Learn as much as you can from the episode to prevent it happening again. Catastrophes often have the side-effect of increasing people's productivity and ingenuity.</p>",
  "<p>Have you ever thought of buying a pension plan for your baby? No, don't turn the page. This might sound ridiculous but, if you have the money, it could be a very prudent move. And many parents and grandparents who have the available cash are likely to start doing it when it becomes possible for the first time next April. </p> <p>The rules of the new stakeholder pension are 'great for your Highgate Socialists', says Charles Levett-Scrivener of independent financial adviser Towry Law. 'I'm expecting some parents who have some spare money and grandparents to do this.' Ian Johnson of Grant Thornton is also finding an 'enthusiastic' response. </p> <p>Until now, such a move has not been possible. People have only been able to pay into a pension from their own earnings. But the stakeholder pension will allow people to contribute even if they are not in work. Although this relaxation is intended to help mature students, mothers on career breaks and other carers, it will also help the wealthy to provide for their non-working spouses, children, grandchildren and any other dependants. Stakeholder rules stipulate that a contract may only be opened for an under-18-year-old by a parent or guardian, but grandparents can pay for the contributions provided the parent/guardian knows about it. </p> <p>The real benefit of a stakeholder pension is the tax break. There is tax relief, pegged at the basic rate (22 per cent), on contributions. The maximum annual contribution is to be set at \u00a33,600. The way the system will work in practice, however, is that someone making a contribution will make the payment net of tax. So someone paying the maximum will pay in \u00a32,808 (ie 78 per cent of \u00a33,600) and the remaining 22 per cent (\u00a3792) will be added as a tax-relief top-up by the Government. </p> <p>The ideal candidates to save for Baby George are the well-off. Johnson expects some clients will each year be putting money into pension plans for various non-working family members: 'If you are reasonably wealthy and have enough to pay your \u00a37,000 into an ISA each year, you might also want to put in \u00a33,600 for your non-working spouse or your children and grandchildren. You could end up with pretty substantial sums set aside.' </p> <p>You certainly could. If you gave Baby George pension contributions, he could end up never having to make any himself. On the most modest estimations (assuming investment growth of just 1 per cent pa after inflation and charges), the 53-year old George would have accumulated \u00a3100,000 if you invested your \u00a32,808 net each year for the first 18 years of his life. </p> <p>And if you think George is likely to want to spend, spend, spend, you might decide that tying the money up in a pension was the best way of preserving your gift. If you took another possible route and used your annual ISA allowance to set aside the same sums, he might decide to blow the \u00a371,000 (again assuming 1 per cent growth a year) which had accumulated for him at age 18 in, perhaps, three glorious years at university. </p> <p>Of course, the irony is that the type of people likely to start pensions for children could be barred from the scheme themselves: people who earn more than \u00a330,000 a year and who are already contributing to an occupational pension will not be allowed to take out stakeholder pensions.</p>",
  "<p>Guy Kawasaki is CEO of <a href=\"http://www.garage.com\" target=\"_new\">garage.com</a> - CEO as in chief evangelist officer. This is a reference to his time at the ultimate Silicon Valley garage start-up, Apple Computer. As 'software evangelist' for the original Mac, Kawasaki became a legend for his ability to persuade developers to write software for a device that at that time had a processor that was 'too slow, had infinitesimal RAM, no hard disk, no colour, no expansion slots, no installed base' - and, apparently, not much future. </p> <p>These days Kawasaki, 46, evangelises for a different cause. He wants radical, world-changing entrepreneurs like those who developed the Mac to set up their revolutions in his garage. </p> <p>Garage.com's mission is, he says, to 'democratise the venture capital process'. By this he means that Silicon Valley's acclaimed capital allocation market has been distorted by its own success. At the top end, big venture capital funds have attracted so much cash that they will only invest in tranches of $10 million and up. They won't even look at a business plan unless it is introduced by someone they know. </p> <p>At the bottom end, the three Fs (family, friends and fools) remain the first source of funds for most budding entrepreneurs. But in the middle there's a gap, inhabited by infant companies that need a first round of institutional money to complete a prototype, ship their first product and find customers. This is the gap garage.com aims to fill. </p> <p>'What we're trying to do is foster a meritocracy,' Kaw asaki says. 'If you have a good idea and a good background, you too can be considered for funding. Unlike VCs, we look at every business plan that comes in - about 12,000 a year - and from those we select about 60 to take on as clients to help them raise funds.' In return, garage.com takes a small stake - much smaller than most VCs or incubators. </p> <p>Does it work? Yes and no, says Kawasaki, who filed for an IPO in February, before the April stock market shake-out. Of the 50-odd companies garage.com has funded, to the tune of $130m, it has scored no runaway hits. On the other hand there have been two 'liquidity events', both acquisitions. And, '70 per cent of our companies are funded by VCs, and most are going on to further funding rounds' - not bad going, he thinks, for a year-and-a-half's work. </p> <p>Unlike many start-up entrepreneur, Kawasaki admits that his job would be easier if the stock markets were riding high - at pre-April levels. But fortunately garage.com has another string to its financial bow: the 'bootcamp'. Bootcamp is a 48-hour primer for would-be entrepreneurs on how to start changing the world. In an atmosphere somewhere between a rock concert and a revivalist meeting, it brings together 500 to 700 would-be business revolutionaries eager to learn how to draw up a business plan (25 pages maximum), how to perfect an 'elevator pitch' (no more than the 30 seconds it takes to travel five floors), how to get venture capitalists to stump up the cash (ask for less rather than more so you can say 'I'm fully subscribed' - at which point others will demand to be let in). </p> <p>A gifted performer, Kawasaki is by turns inspirational and self-deprecating. At a recent bootcamp in London, he harangued, cajoled and flattered his audience, his tales from the entrepreneurial front line striking a powerful chord. Revolution, he exhorts, is not a 20 per cent improvement in something that exists already, but a jump to the next curve - an eBay, Amazon or Yahoo! </p> <p>But the revolution doesn't happen overnight. It's a process, not an event. So yes, ship a flawed product - like the Macintosh - but then test it and 'churn, baby, churn', migrating it to version 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 until it's good enough for the revolution to catch light. </p> <p>Let a thousand flowers bloom. If people use your product for things you never intended, listen to what they are saying and adapt accordingly. Apple was delivered its saving niche not by its own efforts but by a strange new programme that did 'desktop publishing' - something Apple had never heard of. </p> <p>Finally, pleads Kawasaki, don't let the bozos grind you down. The world is full of bozos, but they are not necessarily who you think. 'Often the bozos are successful in this revolution, but they're in denial about what will be successful in the next,' he says. </p> <p>Tom Watson at IBM thought that the world market for the first generation of computers would be five; Digital's Ken Olsen opined: 'There is no reason why anyone would want a computer in their room'; and a certain successful PC revolutionary turned down the chance to interview for the job of CEO at an internet start-up called Yahoo! </p> <p>That person, the speaker admits wryly, was Guy Kawasaki. Which is why he is now on the stump, urging his listeners in a Nineties reworking of Timothy Leary's Sixties mantra to 'get in, kick butt, cash out'. Be revolutionary, he tells them to thunderous applause: 'Get funded. Change the world.' </p> <p><strong> Kawasaki's 10 top lies told by entrepreneurs</strong></p> <p><strong>1: </strong> Our projections are conservative. </p> <p><strong> 2:</strong> Our market will be $50 billion by 2003.</p> <p><strong> 3:</strong> Amazon.com will sign our contract next week.</p> <p><strong> 4:</strong> Key employees will join us as soon as we are funded.</p> <p><strong> 5:</strong> We have first-mover advantage. </p> <p><strong>6:</strong> We need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement. </p> <p><strong> 7:</strong> Big retailers are too slow to be a threat. </p> <p><strong> 8:</strong> We're glad the bubble has burst. </p> <p><strong> 9:</strong> Our patents make our business defensible. </p> <p><strong> 10: </strong> All we have to do is get 1 per cent of the market.</p>",
  "<p>Every day at 10 minutes past noon a lean, lugubrious-looking man in his 60s with long hair and a moustache emerges in running clothes from his formal, well-clipped garden near the village of Much Birch and sets off on a steady jog through the rolling countryside of Herefordshire. </p> <p>This is Sir Roy Strong, aesthete and author, escaping from the cocoon of work and study to immerse himself for three quarters of an hour in a bigger world of sky and hills, woodland and streams and time-worn buildings. Without it, he says, he'd turn into a complete toadstool. </p> <p>\"I just put my jogging things on and do the circuit, and then I can feel my body move, I'm breathing, I'm looking at the countryside, and I just feel everything fall away,\" he says. \"It's wonderful because one's subconscious takes over. You switch to another part of your mental make-up. </p> <p>\"I find I'm just looking and observing and absorbing the air and the landscape. And I don't ever regard it as irksome - if I don't do it, I miss it terribly.\" </p> <p>The circuit begins along a hedged lane, then forks left for a dramatic descent into the valley of Wriggles Brook, which runs into the nearby River Wye. Here Sir Roy takes the brakes off and hurtles down towards the cottages and gardens at the bottom. </p> <p>The road then climbs over the shoulder of a hill which gives dazzling views across the rugged landscape, crosses a rushing stream, passes an old black-and-white timbered farmhouse and comes to the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance - the church at Hoarwithy, sitting high on a knoll. </p> <p>\"It's like a little bit of Sicily, with a kind of cloister and a tower - this extraordinary late 19th-century church up on the heights with a wonderful little rectory next to it. Some local worthy obviously had an enormous amount of money and lavished it on this magnificent building, almost in the middle of nowhere.\" </p> <p>In the chancel, white marble columns support a dome with a golden apse and a mosaic depiction of Christ as the ruler of the world. The pulpit and altar are also white marble, inlaid with green marble, porphyry, lapis lazuli and tiger's-eye. </p> <p>After this treat, he might detour for a look at the River Wye, but usually he takes a right turn and heads for home. The lane climbs, falls and climbs again through the cider apple orchards, and goes near a battery chicken farm to which Sir Roy objects because he's virtually vegetarian - \"although I still eat Parma ham\". </p> <p>Sometimes he gets home without seeing anyone, but more often he meets cyclists or people on horseback, and occasionally has to jump out of the way of outsize farm machinery. His most regular encounter is with an elderly lady out for her daily walk, with whom he exchanges smiles and greetings. </p> <p>\"I've seen this circuit in every season because I do it all year, and you see the leaves come and go, and the hips on the wild roses and the berries on the honeysuckle, the primroses and the lilies and the whole cycle of the wild flowers, if they haven't been massacred by the local authority. </p> <p>\"I love doing it, and I may just pause and walk a bit if I see something in the hedge. If I see blackberries, I can't resist stopping and picking a handful and popping them in my mouth. Or if a dog rose or the honeysuckle is particularly beautiful, I like to poke my nose into it and smell it.\" </p> <p>Spring is his favourite season, when he can shed his tracksuit and watch the lambs bouncing around in the fields. </p> <p>\"But I do it all through the winter, I don't mind going out in the rain, and I just observe it as a disclpline of life. I have this firm belief that you have to make a own contribution to your own health.\" </p> <p>Sir Roy first started doing regular exercise at the age of 43, and now regards himself as \"the master of the eight-minute mile\". </p> <p>His own parents could hardly get out of their chairs at his age, he says, but he's hoping to run for at least another 10 years: \"My father-in-law was a great example to me - even when he was 83 or 84, he would always put on his coat every day and go out for a walk.\"</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Principal rail stations in Herefordshire are at Hereford, Leominster and Ledbury: National Rail Enquiries 08457 484950.

  "<p>If, like me, you are old enough, and committed enough, to have seen Jimi Hendrix play live more than once, then you'll know the significance of September 18 1970. It was 30 years ago on Monday that Jimi was found dead by his girlfriend, Monika Dannemann, in their London flat. </p> <p>If, unlike me, you are one of the world's richest men, then you might indulge one of your adolescent interests in middle-age with a few spare bob that you have in the bank, and create what must be one of the most extraordinary museums in the world. </p> <p>That, at least, is what Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, and his partner Joe Patton, have done in creating the Experience Music Project. Designed by Canadian architect Frank Gehry, the building looks like half a dozen balls of brightly-coloured Playdough shaped by a giant's hands, with a few broken guitar fretboards thrown on the top for good measure. </p> <p>Straddling the Seattle monorail, which clatters between the Seattle Center and the downtown Westlake Center (an early prototype for the ubiquitous shopping mall), the Project opened in June and demonstrates what can be achieved by a consuming passion and seemingly-unlimited resources. </p> <p>Seattle is an appropriate setting for such an imaginative and ambitious project. The home of Starbucks, Boeing and Microsoft and the setting for Frasier and Free Willy, it has become the most desirable alternative location for Californians fed up with increasing pollution. It was also the birthplace of one James Marshall Hendrix on November 27 1942. </p> <p>Not surprisingly then, large portions of the museum are devoted to Hendrix's life, work and ideas. On entering, you are equipped with a shoulder-slung guide, consisting of a CD-Rom player and a hand-held LCD display and keypad which you point at exhibits to hear more information about them through the headphone set. As my 11-year-old son discovered, this is enough to sustain the interest of those who have never even heard of Jimi Hendrix. </p> <p>The state-of-the-art guide is handed to you in the main entrance area, which is called the Sky Church, a name coined by Jimi to describe an area where people come together to share a sense of communion through music. It is a performance area capable of holding 650 people with the largest indoor LCD screen in the world. </p> <p>One whole gallery is devoted to artefacts associated with his band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, including Jimi's favourite guitar, the white Fender Stratocaster he played at Woodstock, Noel Redding's bass, and Mitch Mitchell's drum-kit. </p> <p>The only exhibit visitors have any hope of physically touching is the guitar and, if like me you are over 6ft tall, you can just reach over the plexiglass barrier and touch it. As I discovered, this immediately sets off the alarm, but if you stay cool and pretend it has nothing to do with you, then you should get away with it. In any event, I know Jimi would have approved. </p> <p>In another gallery covering the history of rock music, a stage outfit worn by Janis Joplin is on display, along with one of Elvis's leather biking jackets. All of this raises questions about the concept of a museum like this - rock music is, after all, about living now and to hell with the future or the past. However, the Experience Project is redeemed by the interactive elements, where it is possible to try to create your own music. </p> <p>In the Sound Lab you can learn the basics of playing the drums, keyboards, guitar and bass, or jam in soundproof booths with your family, friends, or other visitors. </p> <p>Those with a more egotistical streak can go on stage at a virtual concert with a full set of stadium rock equipment, bright lights, smoke machines and thousands of screaming virtual fans. </p> <p>The Project also features a new twist on the simulator ride, where you can go on the Artist's Journey through a variety of musical experiences. The first of these, Funk Blast, is, not surprisingly, a journey through the world of funk music. You begin by watching a short video describing the basics of funk, before moving up a ramp around a giant multi-coloured boot signed by funk stars and surrounded by video screens preparing you for your ride. </p> <p>The ride is a standard flight simulator with a very non-standard visual experience that takes you through tunnels of funk, on stage, and out into the street with a range of ridiculously dressed musicians. You come to the end by almost disappearing down the gap between James Brown's front teeth. </p> <p>There's no doubt that this is a museum with a difference, and whether or not you are a fan of Jimi Hendrix, it more than deserves a visit for the imagination that has gone into it. Be warned, however, that some preciously-held beliefs might be shattered. I always thought Purple Haze was a song about a psychedelic drug experience, but driving around I realised that it refers to the lavender farms that abound in the Seattle area and advertise their purple haze on roadside billboards. </p> <p>You can also visit Jimi's grave in Greenwood Memor ial Park, Renton, a suburb of Seattle, which you can reach in half an hour by car. Some 50,000 people a year make the pilgrimage, many taking rubbings of Jimi's modest grave stone. </p> <p>\u0095 For details of the <a href=\"http://www.emplive.com\">Experience Music Project</a>, call 001 206 233 3989 - adults $19.95, over 65s and 13-17s $15.95, 7-12 s $14.95, 6 and under free. </p> <p><strong> What else to do</strong></p> <p> Americans of all generations frequently use three adjectives - \"awesome\", \"really neat\", and \"cool\" - to describe things they like. So the following Seattle attractions are grouped under these headings. </p> <p> <strong> Awesome: </strong> Mount Rainier, a 14,400ft volcano, is visible to the south of Seattle about 80 days a year, and its appearance constantly changes. For a better view of the volcano, and of the spectacular Seattle skyline, take a return trip (30 minutes each way) on the Washington State Ferry from pier 52 on the waterfront to Bainbridge Island. A return ticket costs $6.50 per car and driver, and $3.70 per person, 30% reduction for 5-18s, under 5s go free. </p> <p>Mount St Helens, which exploded in 1980, is about 100 miles south. You can visit both mountains in a day. The devastated area around Mt St Helens is only just beginning to regenerate, so you are still able to get an idea of the power of the explosion. There is a $10 fee to enter either of these national parks. </p> <p>The Olympic National Park, to the west, includes the Hoh rainforest with giant trees and mosses, and the Pacific wilderness beaches, where you might spot seals, sea otters and, in spring and autumn, migrating grey whales. In winter, you can ski on Hurricane Ridge. Again there is a $10 entrance fee. </p> <p>More information about all three parks is available on the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov\">National Park Service</a> website.</p> <p>If you fancy fishing for salmon from Westport, try booking with <a href=\"http://www.oceansportfishing.com\">Deep Sea Charters</a>, (001 360 268 9300)</p> <p>From the San Juan Islands to the north, you are almost certain to see killer whales. Three pods are resident all year round. You can go direct from Seattle to Friday Harbour on San Juan Island, or, if you drive to Bainbridge Island and then go via Port Townsend to Whidbey Island, you can cross the spectacular Deception Pass. </p> <p>The San Juan Islands were the setting for the book Snow Falling on Cedars and for the films Free Willy and Practical Magic.

  "<p>Soaring fuel prices and the strength of the US dollar are threatening increases of up to 10% in the price of many of next summer's holidays. </p> <p>Long-haul travellers will be worst affected. The longer the flight, the more important fuel becomes as a proportion of overall costs. Airlines pay for that fuel in dollars. And hoteliers and other suppliers in other countries besides the US - notably in the Caribbean and Latin America - set their rates in dollars. It all adds up to a very nasty combination of economic punches. </p> <p>But its impact on tour operators is mixed. Those yet to publish long-haul programmes for next summer may have to up their prices by around 10%. The response of those with brochures already out will depend on whether they offer no surcharge guarantees - and on the extent to which they have bought dollars at a fixed rate in the forward market and their agreements with airlines. </p> <p>Some firms whose booking conditions allow them the option of surcharging are struggling to avoid doing so by swallowing the extra costs. In any case, operators are forbidden by law from doing so less than 30 days before the customer departs. They must absorb extra costs up to 2% of the holiday price, and clients may cancel without penalty if the extra charge exceeds 10%. </p> <p>Most big operators promise not to surcharge - but that may not stop them issuing updated editions of their programmes, with higher prices. </p> <p>They could also follow the course adopted by long-haul specialist Kuoni, which, when customers telephone to book, is quoting higher prices on some packages than those shown in the brochure. For example, it is adding \u00a368 per couple to the all-inclusive brochure price of \u00a31,033 in late January at the Rex Turtle Beach on Tobago. The firm will not surcharge customers after a booking has been made, however, and a spokeswoman adds: \"We are trying to offset these cost increases by re-negotiating our deals with suppliers.\" </p> <p>Noel Josephides, managing director of Sunvil, says price rises in Europe will be offset by an 8-10% strengthening of sterling against key currencies such as the Greek drachma. But this will not be enough to balance rate increases imposed by hoteliers and higher flying costs. The net result could be an increase of 5-6 % in next summer's package prices, adding about \u00a322 to a \u00a3450 holiday. </p> <p>But it is the firm's long-haul customers who will bear the brunt. \"Our Namibian programme won't be as badly hit because we pay hotels in rand. But in Central and South America and Zambia we are charged in dollars. I reckon we'll have to raise our prices to those countries by about 10%.\" </p> <p>Journey Latin America warns that its prices in its latest escorted-tours brochure, which is about to be published, will have to rise \"significantly\". </p> <p>Director Brian Williams says: \"So far the problem is the strength of the dollar. Fuel price rises haven't fed through yet.\" </p> <p>Some US airlines have already slapped a $20 per round trip fuel surcharge on domestic fares. But carriers flying to South America are in a bind.

  "<p> <strong> Katharine Viner</strong> </p> <p><strong> Estimated total: \u00a3600</strong></p> <p> I was in need of a quiet, beachy holiday with as little activity as possible, so went to stay with my friend Jack in his family's apartment in Gozo, a small, beautiful island off Malta. Thanks to Jack's generosity, this was not a holiday that broke the bank, but I do get a bit carried away when faced with the two words \"duty-free\". </p> <p><strong> What I spent</strong></p> <p> <strong> Flights: </strong> BA to Malta \u00a3260. </p> <p> <strong> Clothes: </strong> Three summer dresses (Selfridges, Top Shop) \u00a3150; new bikini (Selfridges, didn't wear) \u00a340.</p> <p> <strong> Books: </strong> Philip Roth, Janis Joplin biography, Anita Desai \u00a340.</p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Legs and bikini wax \u00a330; suntan lotions (Nivea, Factor 15, 12, 8, plus after-sun) \u00a335; sun-protecting shampoo and conditioner (Kerastase) \u00a315; mosquito repellent and cream (Superdrug) \u00a310; breakfast at airport \u00a34. </p> <p> <strong> Duty-free on the way out: </strong> CDs (inc Craig David with free video, Bob Dylan, Beach Boys, Cardigans, UK Garage and Ibiza compilations) \u00a380; perfume (Armani) \u00a340; vodka and cointreau for holiday \u00a320. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Cab to airport \u00a326; cab from Malta airport to ferry \u00a312; share of jeep hire, plus petrol \u00a354; cab from ferry to Malta airport \u00a312; cab home \u00a328. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation: </strong> \u00a30. </p> <p> <strong> Basics: </strong> Kitty for the week \u00a3150; share of utilities \u00a329. </p> <p> <strong> Entertainment: </strong> Dinner for three \u00a330; entry and drinks in the Grotta nightclub \u00a315; beers out (total for week, rounds at 30p a bottle) \u00a315. </p> <p> <strong> What I bought on the way home: </strong> Presents (wine, nougat, sarong for Mum) \u00a340; British newspapers at airport \u00a35; duty-free moisturiser (Clarins) \u00a330; duty-free kalhua and rum \u00a320. </p> <p><strong> Real total: \u00a31,190 </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Verdict: </strong> It was more than I thought I'd spent, but worth every penny. And I still have the Craig David CD to dance to in my bikini. </p> <p> <strong> Will Woodward and Rachel Cooke</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Estimated total: \u00a32,000</strong></p> <p> It felt expensive before we left, mainly because of \u00a3680 for a week's stay in an (admittedly delightful) house overlooking Meloi beach in Patmos. But we spent money like Greek mineral water, and usually can't be bothered to check it. Was it a cheap holiday? No. Did we need it? Yes. </p> <p><strong> What we spent</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Flights: </strong> Heathrow-Athens-Rhodes, Olympic Airways, \u00a3646 for two. </p> <p> <strong> Clothes:</strong> Two swimsuits \u00a324, three T-shirts \u00a315, new beach towel \u00a310. </p> <p> <strong> Books:</strong> Rough Guide to Greek Islands, Carol Shields, Raymond Chandler, Adhaf Soueif, Sybil Bedford, JK Rowling, Martin Amis \u00a348.93. </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Insect repellent \u00a34; copy of the Guardian at airport \u00a30.45. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Early-morning mini-cab Hackney-Heathrow \u00a330; Heathrow Express to Paddington x 2 \u00a324; cab Paddington-Hackney \u00a316. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation:</strong> House in Patmos for seven days,<strong> </strong> \u00a3680. </p> <p> <strong> Paid on credit card: </strong> Meal in Rhodes \u00a348.86; unnecessary tip \u00a37.58. </p> <p> <strong> Money taken out of cash machines: </strong> Heathrow \u00a3202.61; Rhodes \u00a3187.02; Patmos \u00a3357.03.

But it was worth it. </p> <p> <strong> Andrew Gilchrist </strong></p> <p> <strong>Estimated cost: \u00a31,600 </strong> </p> <p> I spent two weeks in Thailand (trekking round the hills up north, scuba-diving off the southern islands, boozing in Bangkok) then a week-long bender in Hong Kong staying at a mate's.

I knew I hadn't exactly been tight-fisted. But having now totted things up, I clearly went bananas, blazing round south-east Asia haemorrhaging cash. I booked my flight late, which was costly, then thought: why spend all that then skimp when I get there? So I didn't. And it was worth it - especially the Full Moon party and the Sunny Paradise massage. </p> <p><strong> Mark Porter and Lizzy Hubbard</strong></p> <p> <strong> Estimated total: \u00a32,300</strong></p> <p> The first week was spent self-catering in a traditional black house by the sea on the isle of Harris. It takes ingenuity to find ways of spending money in Harris, but we succeeded by dining lavishly twice at a nearby hotel. The second week was at a hotel in Skye, which was comfortable, but creaky. It reminded us more and more of Fawlty Towers, so we decamped for the last night to a restaurant with rooms on the other side of the island. </p> <p> <strong> What we spent </strong></p> <p> <strong>Transport: </strong> Return train fare from London (overnight sleeper to Inverness) \u00a3258; ferry tickets \u00a3145.90; cab to Euston \u00a38.50;car hire \u00a3210; petrol \u00a360.43; cab home from Euston \u00a38. </p> <p> <strong> Clothes: </strong> Shoes, T-shirts (one pair of Merrell aquamocs, three T-shirts from Joseph, two T-shirts from agn\u00e8s b) \u00a3225. </p> <p> <strong> Books:</strong> Stewart Brand's The Clock of the Long Now, Lee Seldes' The Legacy of Mark Rothko, Freeman J Dyson's The Sun, the Genome and the Internet and Hugo Vickers' biography of Cecil Beaton \u00a344.62; </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Binoculars (to spy on the Taransay castaways) \u00a329.99; maps \u00a310.50; camera films \u00a312.75; walking kit (we already had the basics, but bought socks, trousers and hat) \u00a3120.45. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation: </strong> Hotel deposit \u00a380; house rental on Harris \u00a3345; house electricity \u00a312; Hotel in Skye (5 nights B&amp;B, pre-dinner drinks, one restaurant dinner, 4 bar meals, telephone) \u00a3678.99; drinks, dinner, B&amp;B for one night at Three Chimneys restaurant-with-rooms \u00a3260. </p> <p> <strong> What we bought when we were there:</strong> Fleece top \u00a343; enough tweed to make two skirts \u00a360. </p> <p> <strong> Food and drink: </strong> Shopping in Inverness (deli, butcher, baker, wine) \u00a3100.15; shopping in Ullapool (household supplies, groceries) \u00a345; pub lunch \u00a312.20; afternoon tea waiting for ferry \u00a34.50; Skye pub/tea shop lunches \u00a329; groceries in Harris \u00a343.20 (bag of fresh langoustines from fishermen at Leverburgh pier was free); Harris pub/tea shop lunches \u00a324; drinks &amp; dinner twice at Scarista House \u00a3203.10; supper in Inverness \u00a365; lunch in Drumnadrochit \u00a312.50. </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Left luggage at Inverness station \u00a38; film processing \u00a320. </p> <p><strong> Real total: \u00a33,179.78</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Verdict: </strong> A lot, considering that most days were spent walking in the hills. Expensive train fares, car hire, hotels, and restaurants mean that a holiday in Scotland costs us much more than one in Italy or Spain (and we have to go to Italy or Spain afterwards to get some decent weather). </p> <p><strong> Ben Mallalieu, Jenny Taylor and three children<br>Estimated total: \u00a33,200</strong> </p> <p> Apart from the cost of the ferry and the apartment, this ought not to be an expensive holiday. Food and drink in France is still the best in the world and far cheaper than in England. We're well stocked up with summer clothes and unread books. We even have plenty of suntan lotion left over from last year, and we won't be buying any English newspapers . . . </p> <p> <strong> What we spent </strong></p> <p> <strong>Clothes: </strong> Swimming costume for Jenny, children's shorts and T-shirts \u00a3100. </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Topping up first-aid kit \u00a320; food staples \u00a320; film \u00a320; batteries \u00a35; Green Card \u00a315; pre-trip service for the car \u00a3360; tank of diesel \u00a340. </p> <p> <strong> What we bought on the journey: </strong> One coffee (between two), one Coca-Cola (between three) at a Little Chef, at least \u00a35; drinks at ferry terminal \u00a315; plastic headlight deflectors \u00a37.50. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation: </strong> Two weeks' self-catering at Pierre et Vacances holiday village, Port du Crouesty, Brittany, plus crossing with Brittany Ferries and insurance \u00a32,411, five-star service \u00a3180, children's clubs \u00a338. </p> <p> <strong> Eating and drinking out: </strong> Six meals \u00a3290, morning coffee and citron press\u00e9s in the harbour \u00a350; cakes from the bakery \u00a330; ice creams \u00a350; beers and soft drinks at various bars and caf\u00e9s \u00a3175. </p> <p> <strong> Eating and drinking in:</strong> Fish, groceries, wine, bread, beer and cider for eight lunches, 12 dinners and 13 breakfasts \u00a3272. </p> <p> <strong> What we bought out there: </strong> Child's swimsuit and three pairs of sailing shoes \u00a322; table-tennis bats and balls \u00a36; beach-tennis bats and ball \u00a34; two wine glasses \u00a33; three coffee mugs \u00a33; oyster knife \u00a31. </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Parking at Carnac \u00a32; museum entrance \u00a39.50; laundrette \u00a310; more children's club sessions \u00a338. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Tank of diesel \u00a325. </p> <p> <strong> What we bought to bring home: </strong> 18 bottles of wine \u00a333; 4 litres cider \u00a33; 10 cheeses \u00a310; five jars of honey \u00a35; one bottle Christian Dior perfume \u00a329. </p> <p> <strong> On the ferry:</strong> Food and drink \u00a330; three cinema tickets for Stuart Little \u00a37.50; photograph of car going on to the ferry \u00a32.50. </p> <p> <strong> Afterwards: </strong> Film processing \u00a333. </p> <p><strong> Real total: \u00a34,380</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Verdict: </strong> Oh dear. It is possible to stay cheaply in France, but somehow we didn't manage it. We could have cut back on the restaurant meals and drinks in caf\u00e9s, even though we generally chose the cheapest menus. We ate much better at the apartment for far less. Most other costs were unavoidable, but we should have made some headlight deflectors out of insulating tape and, of course, never set foot in a Little Chef. But we could easily have spent a lot more.</p>",
  "<p>The British have been heading south to holiday in Mediterranean Europe for so long and in such numbers that it seems every destination has become a clich\u00e9. In Tuscany, you can't move for members of the Cabinet; the Spanish Costas are a summer camp for football fans and a rest home for retired gangsters; and St Tropez is fast becoming a theme park for subscribers to OK! magazine. </p> <p>No less of a clich\u00e9, of course, is the \"undiscovered\" corner of Europe. But visit the Languedoc, a hot, rocky corner of south-west France, and you cannot help but feel you have uncovered a well-kept secret. The Languedoc is, to use travel industry jargon, seriously underdeveloped as a destination. </p> <p>The area has always had a distinct identity defined by its own language (Occitan), a cultural heritage steeped in Catharism (a heretical strand of Christianity), and a degree of Spanish influence. Bordered by the Pyrenees to the south and the Black Mountains to the north, at its heart lies the lower Aude alley - a 100-mile-long triangle with Toulouse, Narbonne and Perpignan at the corners - which stretches in a widening plain to the Mediterranean. </p> <p>With staggering scenery, sandy beaches, ancient castles, abbeys and churches, affordable accommodation, great food, some of the most drinkable vintages in France and a local population not yet sick of the sight of tourists, it has all the elements of a classic Mediterranean holiday minus the crowds. Indeed, if you were in marketing, you would call it the new Provence. It even has its own Peter Mayle in Christopher Hope, whose book Signs of the Heart: Love and Death in Languedoc was published in paperback last month. </p> <p>Hope, however, recently bemoaned the ever-increasing Brit presence. And he's right, of course - the peace and quiet can't last. Ryanair has been operating budget services from Stansted to Carcassonne for more than two years and this summer introduced daily flights to Perpignan. Return flights start at \u00a370 a head plus tax, and nearly 70,000 people flew in between June and August. </p> <p>However, wine, not tourism, is the dominant, industry, with vines growing on every spare scrap of land; one of the great pleasures of the Languedoc is to sit in a restaurant overlooking the vineyards from which the wine in your glass was produced. The peace and quiet may not last long - the Brits are coming - but there's still time to visit without noticing. Fly cheap, hire a car and tour the castles, villages and beaches while you can. </p> <p><strong> The beaches</strong></p> <p> Do not expect the celebrity-filled golden sands of St Tropez - the Languedoc coast is a more egalitarian place than that. Typical is Gruisson, 15 miles from Narbonne. An ancient seaside town supplemented a decade ago with a marina development, the long, shallow bay is backed by rows of beach huts on stilts, which famously featured in the film Betty Blue. </p> <p>There's all the usual beach stuff to do, but a local favourite is bat and ball. The French appear obsessive about the game and it is played with gusto by men and women, young and old alike. </p> <p>The marina at Gruisson has affordable hotel accommodation and enough nightlife to keep one going. At Le Corail, a personable small hotel on the waterfront, a twin room costs \u00a340 a night. </p> <p>The marina is lined with restaurants offering menus ranging from an absurdly cheap 60F (\u00a36) for three courses to 180F for foie gras, langoustine and lobster. The seafood is of the highest quality and as long as you try and eat when the restaurateur wants you to, you can't go wrong (at one restaurant, we were told that it was too hot for the chef to cook lunch). </p> <p>Further south, Argeles sur Mer and Banyuls, the most southerly resorts in France, are a little cosier, more Salcombe than Blackpool. </p> <p><strong> Castles and churches</strong></p> <p>Central to the local heritage is Catharism, the great heresy stamped out by the Catholic church early in the second millennium. The Cathar's differences with Rome seem somewhat petty viewed from the 21st century. Essentially, they believed that evil existed independently of God, while Rome held that Lucifer was initially a good being who revolted against the creator. But in the 13th century, the Cathars belief in this dualism was serious enough for successive pontiffs to launch murderous campaigns against them. By 1244, they had succeeded in crushing the Cathars, but not before the heretics had built hundreds of spectacular mountain-top fortifications, many of which remain. </p> <p>Perhaps the most spectacular is at Querebas, 90 minutes south of Narbonne and high in the Corbi\u00e8res mountains. The remaining castle walls cling to the top of a peak only accessible from one side and commanding views of all approaches. To the south, the Mediterranean twinkles, while to the east the snow-capped Pyrenees peek through the haze. </p> <p>Across the valley from Querebas is the chateau at Puilaurens built on a jagged ridge 900 years ago. They used to fling non-believers to the rocks from here and peering down you gain a truer understanding of what it meant to be dashed. Now the only people hurling themselves off are paragliders drifting with the eagles to the valley floor. </p> <p>Another church in the Corbi\u00e8res has attracted almost as much attention as the Cathar castles but, unlike the ruins on the peaks, it still attracts 25,000 pilgrims a year. The church of St Mary Magadalene in Rennes-le-Chateau is the focus of a complex mythology that puts it in the grassy knoll class of conspiracy theories. It has been variously described as the true resting place of Jesus Christ, home to the Holy Grail and a UFO landing pad. </p> <p>In the late 1800s, Abb\u00e9 Sauni\u00e8re, a man of no great means, spent a fortune restoring the church and presbytery. The source of his fortune is still unclear, but one theory is that he was paid off by the Vatican after uncovering the uncomfortable truth that Christ was smuggled to France before the Romans had a chance to nail him to anything. Whatever the source of Sauni\u00e8re's loot, the tale has inspired a stream of visitors armed with eccentric theories and it lends the tiny church an air of mystery that sets it apart. But it helps to have read a theory or two before you arrive. </p> <p><strong> The villages</strong></p> <p> One of the gentler pleasures of the Languedoc is touring the towns and villages slowly being occupied by speculating Brits. The classic settlement has a bar, a baker, a post office, a church and a square, usually shaded by the plane trees that Napolean planted to protect his troops from the noonday heat. There are few more splendid places to do nothing. </p> <p> Bages overlooks the salt marshes south of Narbonne and is famous for its antique shops and its seafood. </p> <p> Lagrasse, a beautiful medieval settlement on the Aude upstream from Narbonne, is wonderfully bourgeois compared with many of the villages of the Languedoc, which remain pleasantly paisant . It's a sort of French Hay-on-Wye, whose cobbled lanes are full of holidaying Parisiennes and ateliers des art . </p> <p>Unlike many of the ancient monuments in the Languedoc, there is no son et lumiere at Lagrasse, nor a guided tour for the plebs. Instead, on the day we visited, the 14th-century abbey was full of earnest folk in smocks and frameless spectacles gathering to hear playwright Armand Gatti - 1960s radical and dramatiser of Antonio Gramsci's prison diaries - lecture on the nature of revolution. It couldn't have been more clich\u00e9d if he'd hung a string of onions around his neck.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">Ryanair</a> flies twice daily from London Stansted to Carcassonne throughout the summer. From October 29, there will be one flight a day. They operate one flight a day from Stansted to Perpignan all year round, with a second flight on Saturdays between July 22 and September 2. Fares start at around \u00a335 each way plus tax but rise according to availability. Ryanair has a deal with Hertz car rental, and a diesel Renault Megane costs around \u00a3170 a week with a \u00a3500 deposit. Accomodation is cheap and varied. Every town and village has at least a basic chambres d'htes , essentially a room in a family home for around \u00a310 a night including breakfast. For g\u00eetes, check <a href=\"http://www.gites-de-france.fr\">www.gites-de-france.fr</a>. A room in a basic two-star hotelstarts at around \u00a330, but for a slice of luxury try the Hotel de la Cit\u00e9 in Carcassonne, which costs \u00a3120 a night for a double.</p>",
  "The discussion over the fate of the conjoined twins Mary and Jodie has been painted by some as a case of \"the rationalists against the religious as usual.\" <p>The assumption behind this generalisation is that the rationalists will be those putting forward reasoned arguments about the scientific possibilities and what is in the best interests of the twins, while the religious will be making impassioned statements about the will of the Almighty and how we humans should not interfere in such matters. </p> <p>Of course, there are those whose approach to religion is a fundamentalist one, claiming that every word in ancient, supposedly divine, texts must be rigidly followed, and who see every happening in their lives in terms of some kind of divine reward or punishment for their behaviour, or that of previous generations. If this were true of all religious points of view, and all adherents to religion, I would be inclined to agree with the dismissive view of this perspective, and allow the rationalists (whoever they may be) to win the day. </p> <p>But, as a rabbi, I assume I have the right to define myself as a religious person. Members of my congregation - and other congregations - presumably see themselves in the same terms. This manifests itself not in adherence to archaic and outdated practices and beliefs, but in a genuine attempt to learn about the world, using our ancestors' wisdom as a starting point. </p> <p>At this time of the year, a series of laws from the Book of Deuteronomy is read in synagogues. A fundamentalist approach to these laws would, of course, regard them as divine law to be obeyed without question, but that is not my position, nor that of reform or progressive Judaism. </p> <p>The latter approach to this religious text would see it as a collection of regulations, whose purpose was to establish a society which demonstrated justice, both individually and collectively, in the moral, political and social spheres of the existence of a group of people some 2,500 years ago. Such laws and regulations were an attempt by our ancestors to come to terms with a strange and puzzling world, and to create structures to promote justice and an understanding of the divine will. </p> <p>Thus it is that we read that it is forbidden to abuse a needy and destitute labourer, whether a fellow countryman or a stranger in one of the communities of your land (Deuteronomy 24:14). Thus it is that instruction is given not to subvert the rights of the stranger or the fatherless, nor to take a widow's garment in pawn (24:17). Thus it is that our ancestors are told not to gather every last sheaf, olive or grape at harvest time, but to leave some for those who are needy (24:19-21). </p> <p>Such laws are not the fundamentalist ravings of humans who subvert their own will and behaviour to the apparent demands of some invisible greater power. These are intelligent, sensible teachings, whose aim is to create justice - hardly the irrational perspective on the world which many supposed rationalists seem keen to assign to anything which defines itself as religious. </p> <p>The truth is that religion and rationalism are as entwined as - well, as conjoined twins, I suppose. And while the question of separating the two does not bear the same level of personal anguish and potential tragedy as the case of Mary and Jodie, in terms of the future development of humanity we would do well to recognise that religion and God have a voice and a contribution to make in an increasingly rationalist and scientific world. </p> <p>Religion does not offer scientific and medical explanations and options. It does not (though some might consider it does) give pseudo-theological justification for tragic occurrences by regarding them as some kind of divine punishment for apparent previous failings. Instead, it offers a blanket of comfort, a framework within which elements of humanity that cannot be rationally defined - such as compassion and care - find expression. </p> <p>And it is here that religion can speak out most clearly in a world seemingly obsessed with scientific and rational definitions - by recognising that there are elements of life which cannot be so easily quantified, that what makes us human is not our ability to rationalise and explain, but our capacity to care and support one another, to yearn for harmony and, where there is none, to hope and struggle against seemingly impossible odds to rediscover its possibility. </p> <p>If there is anything to be learned from the tragic case of Mary and Jodie, let it be this: the parents deserve our compassion and our respect, and, in the end, whatever the legal and ethical niceties, the decision about their tragic offspring's future can only be theirs, since they must live with its consequences. </p> <p>The rest of us can only silently acknowledge their anguish and courage, and recognise that such courage, and the concern which this situation has evoked, is a testimony to the nobility of the human spirit. And that is a religious statement. </p> <p>Pete Tobias is rabbi of the Glasgow new synagogue.</p>",
  "<p>Life is not just a force for good, it is a force for its own good. Life has a way of managing things in favour of more life. And in the course of doing so, life manages a whole planet. It makes an atmosphere to breathe, and water to drink, and food to eat and then it recycles its own detritus. It hijacks sunlight and passes it around to the next user in digestible, shrink-wrapped form. Having done that, it disposes of itself, directly as nutrient for some other creature, or indirectly as a strata of phosphate or a layer of chalk or fossil limestone, or as energy to burn 1bn years later. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Austrian scientists detected bacteria, living comfortably in high clouds, reproducing themselves and - some think - serving the world by playing rainmaker, acting as \"seeds\" around which water vapour could become raindrops. </p> <p>But this heavenly host of living things surprised no one. Life has been turning up in improbable places for years. People who drilled a mile deep into the basalt of the ocean floor found tiny microbes living on a diet of warmth and rock. Submarine explorers have found huge colonies of strange creatures basking in a kind of chemical cornucopia at the bottom of the ocean's depths, far from any sunlight. Microbes have been found in acid flows, in lakes of soda, down the vents of volcanoes and on the underside of the polar ice, organising the planet for the rest of creation. </p> <p>Might things have got a little hot when carbon dioxide levels built up dangerously at the dawn of the Eocene, 55m years ago? Fear not. The rapid response team was on hand. An Anglo-American team of scientists reported on Thursday that plankton bloomed, the oceans became a garden and greedily mopped up the excess carbon, cooling the greenhouse world to acceptable levels. Not for the first time, nor the last, the biosphere had risen to the challenge, and adjusted itself. </p> <p>It is more than 30 years since James Lovelock, a freelance chemist with a background in medical research and a gift for devising sensitive detectors, worked for Nasa on the Mars exploration programme. While doing so, he began to form the idea of the biosphere as a self-regulating entity, of life and the planet as a kind of sensitive organism, not sensitive to any particular form of life, just to the principle of life. He called it the Gaia hypothesis. The novelist William Golding, a friend and neighbour, suggested the name. Gaia was the Earth goddess, the Greeks' Mother Nature. </p> <p>Touchingly, Lovelock reports in his latest book that he originally thought Golding had suggested calling it the Gyre hypothesis, after the gyres or vortexes that drive ocean and atmospheric circulation. The idea of Gaia caught the imagination of people everywhere. Gaia is a kind of metaphor for a very subtle lesson in the physiology of a planet. But Gaia became a reality, too, for the Greens, particularly those inclined to mysticism. Lovelock doesn't mind. He finds things to marvel at in Gaia, too. \"Some very distinguished scientist, I have forgotten his name, told me when I was quite young that the one thing you have got to keep right through your life or right up to your dotage is a sense of childlike wonder and once it goes, stop doing science,\" he says. </p> <p>He is fond of individual Greens, but he doesn't have much patience for some Green thinking, and in particular the Green attitude to nuclear power. Never mind the British government's little local difficulty with fuel prices, fossil fuels are literally beginning to cost the earth and meanwhile the Green campaigners are rejecting at least one easy answer to the great problem of how to power an economy without shutting down the biosphere with polluting greenhouse gases. </p> <p>This answer, Lovelock says, is ecologically clean and tidy and has a very bad press. It is nuclear power. \"I can envisage somewhere about 2050, when the greenhouse really begins to bite, when people will start looking back and saying: whose fault was all this? And they will settle on the Greens and say: 'if those damn people hadn't stopped us building nuclear power stations we wouldn't be in this mess'. And I think it is true. The real dangers to humanity and the ecosystems of the earth from nuclear power are almost negligible. You get things like Chernobyl but what happens? Thirty-odd brave firemen died who needn't have died but its general effect on the world population is almost negligible. </p> <p>\"What has it done to wild life? All around Chernobyl, where people are not allowed to go because the ground is too radioactive, well, the wildlife doesn't care about radiation. It has come flooding in. It is one of the richest ecosystems in the region. And then they say: what shall we do with nuclear waste?\" Lovelock has an answer for that, too. Stick it in some precious wilderness, he says. If you wanted to preserve the biodiversity of rainforest, drop pockets of nuclear waste into it to keep the developers out. The lifespans of the wild things might be shortened a bit, but the animals wouldn't know, or care. Natural selection would take care of the mutations. Life would go on. </p> <p>\"I have told the BNFL, or whoever it was, that I would happily take the full output of one of their big power stations. I think the high-level waste is a stainless steel cube of about a metre in size and I would be very happy to have a concrete pit that they would dig - I wouldn't dig it - that they would put it in.\" He says he would use the waste for two purposes. \"One would be home heating. You would get free home heat from it. And the other would be to sterilise the stuff from the supermarket, the chicken and whatnot, full of salmonella. Just drop it down through a hole. I'm not saying this tongue-in-cheek. I am quite serious,\" he says. \"They would be welcome to take pictures of my grandchildren sitting on top of it.\" </p> <p>Lovelock regards himself as an eccentric, and a radical, and he enjoys being a member of the awkward squad. The Gaia hypothesis was a huge delight to some, but it was a huge provocation to others. It also plunged Lovelock into a war of metaphors. Most of the battle was with the biologists, who had a different set of metaphors to defend. Some scientists, for example, call the Earth the Goldilocks planet, because Venus, hot enough to melt lead, was too warm and Mars, the frozen desert, was too cold, but Earth was just right for life. So in their view, the planet manages life, not the other way around. </p> <p>Another group thinks of the fullness and richness of biodiversity as the outcome of \"selfish genes\", hectically competing to replicate themselves. So for them, life is a battle for tenure rather than an invitation to the dance. And then along came Lovelock, a non-biologist who proposes something disconcerting: that the earth is fit for life because life made it that way. The battle was brisk, because life is the great mystery. There are three great stories that science has to tell: one of these is where the universe came from, one is where life came from and the third is where humans came from. The first and the last are being sorted out right now. Cosmologists think, for instance, that they have the story of creation figured out, except for the first 1,000th of a second. Anthropologists have settled on a consensus that modern humans emerged in Africa about 250,000 years ago, the latest and only survivors in a line of hominids. </p> <p>But the origin of life is a puzzle. Think of it as a kind of reverse murder mystery. The bringing-to-life happened in a locked room in a strange world 3.4 bn years ago. There is no surviving scene of the not-crime. There are no footprints, no strewn clues. The evidence was destroyed by the very creatures that rose from original experiments in fashioning the living chemistry from non-living chemicals. Whatever conditions made life possible were promptly erased by the action of life itself. The last surviving universal common ancestor went round eliminating all chances of new rivals emerging. </p> <p>Life came into a planet with an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, and began to alter it, producing as waste a dangerous, reactive gas called oxygen which could ultimately have brought the whole experiment to a halt. So life's - and Gaia's - next step was to favour a balancing set of creatures that consumed oxygen and breathed out carbon dioxide. But once that was done, the original atmosphere was gone, and water and nitrogen cycles were wiping away any evidence that might have been left in the rocks. </p> <p>Lovelock began thinking of such things three decades ago when he worked on Nasa's search for evidence of life on another planet. He proposed in effect that you could tell that the earth was alive from a million miles away. Its atmospheric chemistry would shout of life. He proposed that the 70s Mars probe instruments could confirm the presence of life on the red planet by detecting an atmosphere of dynamic disequilibrium. </p> <p>If there had been life on Mars, it would have been a very different planet. The atmosphere of Mars is 98% carbon dioxide and very stable. Venus is 98% carbon dioxide and a very nasty example of a runaway greenhouse effect. The earth no doubt started at 98% carbon dioxide too but today's atmosphere is a mixture of inflammable oxygen and reactive nitrogen with just a touch of carbon dioxide, and something is definitely keeping this explosive mixture primed. </p> <p>He says Nasa ignored his proposal at the time but the future search for life on planets outside the solar system will be based entirely on Lovelock principles. At some future point, fleets of spacecraft working in exquisite unison will focus on little specks of light reflected from parent stars, looking for the spectral signatures of telltale gases such as oxygen and water vapour and methane. </p> <p>You couldn't imagine oxygen and methane surviving together for very long in the same atmosphere. So if you spotted these in the gleam from a planet 30 light years away you'd start to wonder. \"If there is a lot of methane, oxygen won't rise by accident. So you have to postulate a process on the surface that is producing gigatonnes if not teratonnes of both of those gases all the time and not only that but regulating them, because if you didn't regulate them you would be in danger of making an inflammable atmosphere or something like that. So that then becomes conclusive evidence of life,\" he says. </p> <p>The American enthusiasm for possible life on Mars amuses him. \"I think it is all part of the American frontier mentality. This Mars is the ultimate place, we can go there when we have screwed up the earth. We have the technology, we can fix it. The national legend of America is very tied up with Star Trek and if you go to scientific meetings you hear Star Trek metaphors paraded around all the time and to them it no longer is a kind of story, it is reality and there is a great danger in their thinking.\" </p> <p>Lovelock is now 81. He and his wife Sandy - his first wife, Helen, the mother of his children, died after a long illness - have completed the 600-miles coastal walk from Poole, Dorset to Minehead , Somerset. He has pursued a long career as a kind of freelance scientist and he says big corporations are not for him, although he is happy to sell them his inventions. He doesn't care for science run by bureaucracies. He lives in an idyllic corner of Devon, on a 35-acre farm, on which he has planted 25,000 trees. </p> <p>He takes the long view of eco-hazards, he says. He isn't bothered by the menace of industrial chemicals like PCBs or agricultural fertilisers in the way that Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth are. A chemist from the start, he points out that according to a Royal Society of Chemistry survey, chemists live longer than most scientists. The big threat to the planet, he says, is people: there are too many, doing too well economically and burning too much oil. </p> <p>\"It's the people that count and the only message I would have to give is to stop fretting, stop looking for scapegoats, people are to blame for the condition of the earth. It is me, you, all of us that are to blame and if we are going to do anything about it we have to tackle it individually, not expect anybody to take the load off us and do it. If you are a housewife in Balham you are not, probably, doing anywhere near as much to damage the planet as suburbanites and exurbanites living around here, using their cars wholly unnecessarily in huge numbers of journeys and burning far more fuel. The more money you have, the more damage you can do.\" </p> <p>His new book is a hymn to science, and to Gaia and to the other makers of his great idea, and to the forces that made him choose to swim upstream, to stay independent, to be free to follow his nose. He grew up with Quaker principles, and became a conscientious objector in the second world war. He spent 20 years at the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, a lab with 100 scientists and six Nobel prizewinners, and then he started pleasing himself, usually by devising instruments that pleased big business, or Nasa, or the Ministry of Defence. </p> <p>He built a detector so sensitive it could trace seemingly infinitesimally small concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. Famously, he remarked that such low levels could do no harm. He should have written no toxic harm, he says. They were, of course, the chemicals that began to demolish the ozone layer. He thinks the big dangers to the planet are the greenhouse effect and the spread of humanity. Humans, just by their fecundity, and their economic demands, have begun to affect habitat and biodiversity so furiously that it might be that one day Gaia might not be able to step in and adjust the conditions to secure her own reign. The planetary regulator might not regulate so efficiently. </p> <p>In that sense, biodiversity was a kind of insurance, a spreading of bets to allow life to survive the kind of catastrophes - from outer space, or from volcanoes - that have seriously interrupted evolution at least five times in the last 600m years. Meanwhile, humans could get their comeuppance in some quite mundane but unexpected way. </p> <p>\"Every few hundred years or less, there is a natural geological disaster, like a big volcano. Tambora was the last, in 1815, and the one before that was Laki in 1783. Both of those were followed by two years without any harvest. Now in those days, people survived. There were famines, but people survived. What would happen now?\" he asks. He was speaking before the British pickets began their fuel blockade, and before panic-stricken consumers began clearing supermarket shelves. He was speaking long before word began to leak of UK government statement to be made on Monday about research into the possibility of some future collision with a large asteroid, an event which would darken the sky, shake continents, shut down agriculture and certainly clear the supermarket shelves the world over. </p> <p>He was simply taking, as he has done all his life, the long view. \"Two years without a harvest? It would probably bust civilisation. People would survive all right. It really would cut us back, and that is the sort of thing nobody really prepares for. It's not some ecological poison or GM foods or nuclear that is going to get us, it is going to be some perfectly ordinary natural event.\"</p>",

Gentile travelled through Venice's eastern empire visiting the Ottoman court; Giovanni was more homebound and is credited with popularising portraiture in Venice. \"He introduced into Venice the fashion that everyone of a certain rank should have his portrait painted either by him or by some other master,\" wrote the 16th-century art chronicler Vasari. </p> <p><strong> Subject: </strong> Leonardo Loredan (1436-1521) in his official costume as Doge of Venice, the Venetian Republic's head of state, elected for life by a college of male nobles. </p> <p><strong> Distinguishing features: </strong> This painting puts Loredan before us, separated only by the stone ledge he stands behind, yet at the same time he is located in a magic realm of perfect blue sky. It is an astonishing exercise in three-dimensional modelling. Bellini has made this painting as solid and deep in space as the Roman portrait busts that Renaissance artists emulated. You feel you could walk around Loredan, and put your hand between the folds of his clothes. This is what all Renaissance artists wanted to achieve, but what Bellini does with perspec-tive is exceptional. These Roman portrait busts were hard, public images of authority. Early Italian Renaissance portraits of powerful men and women had similar qualities. Loredan, behind his ledge, is as static as a marble bust. Yet he is softened by the tenderness with which Bellini renders his flesh, and the delicacy of his garments. </p> <p>Bellini was the definitive Venetian master of colour, reflecting the rich tones in the canals of the city and the fluid Venetian light. Loredan's face glows with the gold evening sun. His skin looks mellow, its age showing not as decay, but as a muting of harsh lines. </p> <p>And his clothes! Loredan was known as a man who dressed well, and his official dress is sumptuous: the ceremonial headgear of damask with gold thread; the big buttons known as \"golden bells\". Bellini paints this finery lovingly, mapping the folds of silvery cloth not with line but with light. As with Loredan's golden skin, the effect is intimate, delicate, even vulnerable: there is a gentle side to this representative of Venetian power. </p> <p>Above all, Loredan is Venice. The Doge was the elected head of state, but also the living embodiment of the republic. Bellini's painting operates in this ambiguous territory of the real and the symbolic. Loredan's gaze is hypnotically calm, he has a merciful smile (but the shadowed part of his face suggests you should fear his wrath) and, in his cloudless sky, he seems beyond any anxiety. Venice called itself Serenissima, and in this painting Bellini gives the serene republic a face. </p> <p><strong> Inspirations and influences: </strong> The first Italian Renaissance portraits were in profile; it was northern European painters such as Robert Campin and Jan Van Eyck who developed the three-quarter profile and the rounded, three-dimensional human presence we see in this painting. But Bellini's genius for defining form through colour is unprecedented in the history of painting, and had incalculable repercussions. </p> <p><strong> Where is it?</strong> Sainsbury Wing, National Gallery, London WC2 (020-7747 2885). </p>",
  "<p>Last week, I wrote about enjoying your garden. This week, by contrast, you shall read about making it look worthy, in autumn, of your or any friends' presence. The sad fact is that many gardens look a shambles by now - a second flowering on some roses (leaves already stripped by rust and black spot), and that's about the sum of it. Which is our fault, not the season's. </p> <p>There is no need to cut down everything in sight, apart from shrubs, of course. But all dowdy remnants that can no longer give pleasure should go. The tarnished silver of Eryngium giganteum ('Miss Willmott's Ghost'), for instance; the over-prolific, self-sowing purple orach, Atriplex hortensis , now changed from red to brown; likewise Alchemilla mollis, which probably looks a wreck - yet if the whole plant had been shorn back in early August, it would now be covered with a new crop of young leaves. I make these latter form a background to colchicums, which are now in bloom. If there is too much self-sown honesty or fennel or teazels, most of that goes, too, leaving just a few as winter skeletons. </p> <p>Follow-on bedding is a great idea for enlivening the autumn scene. This year, we had dwarf lupins, a seed strain called Gallery Mixed, bedded out late last autumn, at the same time interplanting them with tulips, as young lupin foliage makes a handsome background to those. We removed the whole lot in early July (the bulbs stored, the lupins discarded), and replaced them with African marigolds and a mauve bedding verbena (propagated from cuttings), 'La France'. The marigolds, in orange and yellow, are fully double and in two strains: Jubilee Mixed and Treasure Trove. They make big plants and can be bedded at 0.8m intervals, each plant given one stake and a tie when large (you may be more sheltered than we are). </p> <p>Now, these were not sown till May 18, and they came into flower in late August, just when needed. By timing your sowings, you can manipulate the peaking of your displays. </p> <p>In the same way, we sowed Thompson &amp; Morgan's dahlia collerette Dandy Mixed, also on May 18, and those seedlings followed another earlier lot of summer bedding. We also (largely because we don't get around to the job earlier) take late cuttings from dahlias that we overwinter in store. They produce plants that may not be bedded out till late August, but we are seldom afflicted by frost before November, so the young plants have a good innings and they look fresh when other dahlias may be tiring. </p> <p>Begonias are great value, and we are especially pleased with a tuberous-rooted strain called Dragon Wing we received from Thompson &amp; Morgan as plugs on May 10. It has single, intense red flowers and handsome, glossy foliage. We shall save the tubers from that. </p> <p>Some seed-raised annuals have a prolonged season anyway. Ageratum 'Blue Horizon' is one of our greatest standbys, growing to 0.5m and mixing well with yellow annual rudbeckias, or with begonias. Salvia coccinea 'Lady In Red' (0.5m) is a great seed strain, and will carry two flushes of blossom in most years. It looks good with the bluey-purple Salvia farinacea ' Victoria'. There is a very long-flowering annual that I always grow, called Cuphea 'Firefly' (0.3m), with dusky, pinky-red flowers on a nice bushy plant. We save seed from that from year to year. </p> <p>Grown in pots, you'll still be enjoying heliotrope: a scented kind such as 'Chatsworth' or 'Princess Marina'. Or there's the untiring blue Convolvulus sabatius (save your old plants, splitting them a little next spring), which has a cascading habit, as do nasturtiums. We make fresh sowings of them, one seed or two to a pot up to late July. Zonal pelargoniums ('geraniums') are a wonderful standby, and I turn to them for spots of scarlet and vermilion where highlights are needed. You must keep them fresh by regular dead-heading and by rubbing out the dead centres of flower heads that still have life left in them. Remember that single-flowered kinds stand up to wet weather better than doubles. </p> <p>I must have lilies in pots, to bring forward in their season, and September gives us the Lilium speciosum hybrids and the white trumpet L. formosanum, which is quick from seed. Some perennials are very long-flowering, so you don't have to feel they are keeping you waiting for too many months before they perform - as do some michaelmas daisies. But Aster frikartii 'M\u00f6nch' (0.5m), with large, lavender daisies, is exceptionally generous, blooming from late July to October. </p> <p>Japanese anemones have a similarly prolonged season. I have one long-lasting combination with pink Anemone 'Hadspen Abundance', yellow, deeply cupped Hypericum 'Rowallane' and an umbrella above them of Rosa glauca , with bluish leaves and hips in dangling bunches, which colour now to deep red. I prune this regularly by removing all the flowered wood, in winter leaving only the long, straight new canes, which will flower and fruit for me next year. The shrub is constantly rejuvenated in this way, and never becomes outsize. </p> <p>Some shrubs give us a second flowering, notably hebes such as 'Midsummer Beauty'. The cherry laurel, Prunus laurocerasus 'Otto Luyken' is doing it this year, and I have hopes of the Mexican orange, Choisya ternata.</p>",
  "The late fashion designer Franco Moschino once explained that designers \"kiss each other so much not because they're fond of each other but so that they can whisper fresh insults into each other's ears\". <p>The fashion industry's bi-annual round of catwalk shows kicks off in New York this weekend before taking in London, Milan and Paris. It promises plenty of intrigue and backstabbing, even by its own Machiavellian standards. </p> <p>Interest in catwalk shows has exploded in the past few years. New York fashion week offers nearly 100 shows this season, making it the biggest fashion week ever held, according to organisers. </p> <p>Kevin Krier, one of the city's top show producers, recently told Women's Wear Daily, the industry bible, that he was \"in shock at the number of people who think they should go to fashion shows\". The luxury end of the market is booming. </p> <p>British \"heritage\" brands are enjoying a renaissance.

This week the feud between the powerful Italian houses of Versace and Armani resurfaced after comments by Giorgio Armani in Vanity Fair magazine. </p> <p>Armani, named the world's wealthiest fashion designer when it emerged that he took home $100m (\u00a371m) last year, claimed that Versace once said to him: \"You know something, Giorgio? You dress elegant women. You dress sophisticated women. I dress sluts.\" </p> <p>Donatella Versace, sister of Gianni and his successor, promptly told Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper that she was \"absolutely sure that what Mr Giorgio Armani asserts is untrue\" and his comments were \"disrespectful and mean\". </p> <p>The most eagerly awaited show of the season will be Tom Ford's debut at the helm of Yves Saint Laurent. The show, on the last weekend of Paris fashion week, will be one of the last of the season. </p> <p>Ford, one of the most talented and influential designers, divides his time between Paris and his previous home of Milan, where he designs for Gucci. His new enthusiasm for Paris has reignited competition between the cities, with Chanel's Karl Lagerfeld insisting that \"Paris is more exciting, even if there's more business in Milan\", and the Louis Vuitton designer Marc Jacobs claiming to be \"not terribly interested\" in Milan fashion. </p> <p>Designers stepping into the limelight this season include Narciso Rodriguez, a Cuban-American at present showing his own label in Milan and designing for Loewe in Paris. He is the latest name to be tipped as successor to Alexander McQueen at Givenchy in Paris. </p> <p>Despite repeated statements by Givenchy that it has \"no plans to change McQueen's contract\", due to run until October 2001, rumours persist that he is unhappy with the limits placed on his role and hankers after the input into advertising and house image enjoyed by John Galliano at Christian Dior. </p> <p>Designers showing in Europe have been alarmed by a suggestion that they may have difficulty persuading their favourite models, most of them based in New York, to appear on their catwalks this season, due to the grounding of Concorde - because an overnight flight would play havoc with their sleep and beauty routines. </p> <p>Model agencies, however, insist that their models will be happy to travel subsonically.</p>",
  "<p>Margaret Atwood would like to clear a few things up from the start. She is not a murderer (this in spite of writing as a murderer in Alias Grace). She was not bullied to within an inch of her existence by her childhood best friend (unlike the narrator of Cat's Eye). She is not a femme fatale about to steal your man (The Robber Bride), she does not have an eating disorder (The Edible Woman), and she is not a woman whose lover committed suicide (Life Before Man), nor a woman searching for her lost father (Surfacing). People often think she lives the lives of the characters in her books, she says. But they are not her. </p> <p>This is the message of her new novel, too, which could almost be read as a plea not to confuse the author with the narrator. In The Blind Assassin we have two narrators: Iris, 82 and looking back over her life, and Laura, her sister, author of a pulpy romance bestseller. Iris's story is a bitter one, a loveless tale of abusive marriage, bad loyalties and dissatisfaction. By contrast, Laura's novel within the novel is the tale of a scandalous love affair between a 30s lady in mink and a sexy young Bolshevik.</p> <p>But as time passes, the reader starts to wonder if Laura really did write the novel, and if the extraordinary events in it really did happen to her. What if it were someone else who caused the scandal? Are we right in believing that whoever wrote the novel must have had such experiences in real life? Where did we get the idea that the author is the star of their own fiction? </p> <p>It is also, perhaps, the message of our meeting. All we know and read about Margaret Atwood is that she is \"frosty\" and \"scary\" and \"witch-like\" and \"remote\". She's the \"high priestess of pain\". She's the \"authority on malevolence\". She's Medusa, Boudicca and the Queen Bee. Canadians, who know her better than anyone, warn that she's a ferocious interviewee: if she says you can have an hour, you'll get spot-on 60 minutes. She'll fight you, ridicule you, chew you up and spit you out and make you sorry you came. One writer ended an interview saying that if she ever saw her again, she'd run in the opposite direction. </p> <p>But when we meet on a sticky Toronto midsummer day, Atwood keeps suggesting more things we can do together, kindness after kindness. We go for breakfast, in her favourite cafe. And then lunch, with her husband (more of him later). A hotel for coffee and fruit and meringues. She takes me to her home, her garden. (It doesn't get much light, but has a gargoyle fountain and 10 lilies upright in a circle, tied to sticks, soldiers with rods down their backs.) She becomes my tour guide for Toronto (\"This is where I went to college; this is our legislature\"); she takes me on a tour of locations in her novels (the bridge Laura Chase drives off in The Blind Assassin; the bridge from which Elaine is led down an icy, dark and terrifying ravine in Cat's Eye; a street Roz crosses in The Robber Bride); then, even, a mini-tour of where she used to live.</p> <p>Sometimes when she speaks she puts on the voice of a child; sometimes when she's standing and asking a question she bends one leg inwards, at the knee, like young girls do when they want something. A sweet sort of intimacy. Why do people find her scary? \"They confuse me with the characters in my books,\" she says. (Don't forget. She's not her narrators, and she's not as her image would have her. It's all about what's real and what's not.) </p> <p>It is impossible to overstate just how famous Margaret Atwood is in Canada. For many years, before Jim Carrey and Shania Twain, Atwood was pretty much the only Canadian with international fame. When she started writing, there was no literary tradition; one year in the early 60s, only five Canadian novels were published. (In 1972, Atwood tried to draw some themes and conclusions about the limited number of writers in Canada's history in her extraordinary book of literary criticism, Survival.) But the fallow was fertile for her. \"I didn't feel all those genius men hanging over me,\" she says. \"Canada was a wide open prairie.\" </p> <p>Today, there's a fiction boom - Michael Ondaatje, Carol Shields, Alice Munro - and Atwood has been at the heart of it since The Edible Woman, her first novel, was published in 1969. (She had written it four years earlier, but the publisher lost the manuscript.) Her work since has been a roll call of gleaming successes, novels at once intellectual and popular, emotional and neatly- plotted: from Surfacing, her 1979 novel about a woman's investigation into her father's disappearance on a remote island, which has an emotional impact on all who read it; to the million-selling The Handmaid's Tale, perhaps her greatest work and certainly a classic, a feminist sci-fi horror story in which fertile women are turned into breeding machines; to Cat's Eye, the best novel ever written about how girls can bully each other. Three of her books - The Handmaid's Tale, Cat's Eye and Alias Grace - have been nominated for the Booker Prize. </p> <p>After 30 years at her craft, Atwood's new novel is a work by a writer who knows how to command an audience; getting out of her grasp, once you are in it, is not really an option. Readers develop quite obsessive relationships with her work. She's popular with women (her novels actually feature female characters you can believe in), but also men (she says she gets a large amount of fan mail from British men, who write to say they wish they'd read her books before their divorces - it might have saved their marriages). Atwood is taught in more than three-quarters of British universities. </p> <p>She's an industry on her own: The Blind Assassin is her 10th novel, her 37th book (she also writes poetry, children's books, literary criticism); she is published in more than 30 languages; even her assistant has an assistant. When it comes to book-signing, she has developed a system whereby an assistant passes the book or poster over to her, rather than reaching out. This was because of RSI problems. Yes: Atwood had been getting RSI not from typing, but from signing too many autographs. </p> <p>She arrives for breakfast wearing dark, loose clothing and a big, dark hat that shadows her face. Her eyes are a pale and memorable blue, her skin translucent and unlined, a trait she shares with her 92-year-old mother. (\"Good bones.\") She is tiny. She was once described as \"not like other people\", and there's something in the description - her appearance is both everywoman and strangely ethereal, her voice both quiet and impossible to ignore. Her manner, too, is unusual. This is Atwood, early in our meeting, on Prince Charles: \"If he weren't the prince or the duke or whatever he is, he would be considered a valuable eccentric person going against the grain and speaking out. A sort of Bertrand Russell or Albert Schweitzer of the food chain... He is not properly valued as an objet . If he were in Japan, he'd be valued as some precious, lacquered treasure.\" </p> <p>Her conversation is wry, educated, knowing; a bit superior, challenging you to get the joke. Later, when we're eating a fruit plate and I question the identity of an unfamiliar berry, she says it's a \"boobleberry\". I don't realise that she is making it up, using a little ridicule, at which her eyes glitter: \"We're going to have fun with you.\" (She once said that her humour was just like everyone else's in Atlantic Canada - deadpan. \"They'll tell you the most outrageous lies with a straight face.\") </p> <p>We order - or, rather, she does. \"I would like a freshly squeezed orange juice,\" she drawls, turning to me, \"and so would you.\" (I quickly nod) \"Then I would like a cappuccino,\" she turns to me, \"and so would you.\" (I nod again) \"And then I would like a toasted bagel,\" she turns to me, \"and so would you.\" This time, I shake my head, say no to the bagel. She looks perplexed, and rather thrilled, as if it were rare and fascinating for someone to say no to her. </p> <p>She opens up her grasp, and there's a handful of vitamins. \"Chewable betacarotene. Evening primrose,\" she says, counting them off. \"Glucose amine sulphates, which are good when you start getting a bit arthritic. Remember that. This is a very good kind of calcium, because it's in a gel cap. This is something I can't remember. This is vitamin C. This is a new kind of vitamin E which is supposed to be good for people who have cholesterol, which I have. Life is not fair. This is a ginger pill, which is on general principles. And these -\" she points to the biggest tablets, flecked with purple - \"are an Indian 'erb called Goo Goo lipids, which are supposed to be good for cholesterol.\" (Don't go searching for these. I'm pretty sure she made them up.) </p> <p>So it's the tablets that explain her youthful appearance? \"Actually, I'm 2,000 years old,\" she says. \"And dead.\" That Atlantic sense of humour again. Actually, at 60, she does not smoke, drinks in moderation (\"I drink just exactly the amount they say you're supposed to drink to avoid bursting, or whatever\"') and has never been out in the sun. She has facials, eats well, takes all those pills. It's not magic that makes her look so good: she's in control of what might harm her, takes steps to avoid the possibility of pain. </p> <p>It might be good advice to do something similar before you read an Atwood novel. She is a writer who revels in suffering, who describes pain so that it hurts, so that the reader feels it. One night, after reading The Robber Bride, I was awake until dawn, so deeply upsetting was her portrayal of Charis, who changed her name from Karen to try to obliterate the horrors of an abusive childhood. When, in Toronto, Atwood drove me to the bridge featured in Cat's Eye, the location of a hugely distressing incident of childhood torture in the novel, it was an overwhelming experience...ad to turn back and leave, as if from bad memories. In a way, I suppose I'd been there before - through her fiction, she'd already taken me. </p> <p>So what about this \"high priestess of pain\" label? \"I'm not responsible for other people's metaphors,\" she says. \"What that means is that I'm good at describing certain kinds of emotions. That's all it means. I also can do other things. I'm good at writing fake newspaper reports. High priestess of fake newspaper reports.\" But she describes pain so that it's unbearable, which is a shock when we think we see pain every day on television, news and dramas and chat shows and Oprah.</p> <p>\"There's a difference between describing and evoking something. You can describe something and be quite clinical about it. To evoke it, you call it up in the reader. That's what writers do when they're good. It's one of the things writing can do. Then there's another thing, which is just as difficult, and just as honourable, and that is to be able to evoke joy. There are some people who do that very well, Carol Shields, for example. Some do rage. Others do a disjointed kind of melancholy.\" But what is it that makes a particular writer good at a particular emotion? Why is she so good at pain? \"We don't know it. If we did, we'd package it and sell it. You can never tell anybody else how to do it.\" </p> <p>Readers tend to assume that Atwood must have had some terrible pain in her life, to convey it so well in her work. This infuriates her. \"If you feel that there's the author and then the character, then the book is not working. People have a habit of identifying the author with the narrator, and you can't, obviously, be all of the narrators in all of your books, or else you'd be a very strange person indeed. I do it myself when I'm reading a book...atch myself saying, I wonder if that really happened to her, or, oh, I didn't know she'd had an affair. It's because we're human beings. And human beings are social animals and they form groups of people that they know, and when you read a novel you feel you know the narrator. You can catch yourself in the act, you know it's not real, but you do it anyway, because that's what humans do.\" </p> <p>It must also be to do with the fashion for biography, the gossip culture, the cult of personality: that knowing that a writer committed suicide, or couldn't have children, or hated his mother, colours our understanding of the work on its own. \"Sometimes it is,\" she says, \"but only if you're that kind of person.\" What kind? \"The kind,\" she says, slowly, \"who's interested in gossip to the exclusion of form.\" </p> <p>Of course, it looks stern on paper, but it's the way she tells them. She follows this comment with a tinkly little laugh. </p> <p>\"Let's put it this way,\" she says. \"Who knows which daffodils Wordsworth wrote his poem about? Perhaps there weren't any daffodils. But who cares? What does it matter? All kinds of people have all kinds of really, really interesting things happen to them, and they don't write books about them. And all kinds of other people sit there in their rooms and you can't tell if it's real, you the reader can never actually know. A reader can never tell if it's a real thimble or an imaginary thimble, because by the time you're reading it, they're the same. It's a thimble. It's in the book.\" </p> <p>The Blind Assassin tackles this head on, asking the reader to work out how much of the novel within the novel is really fiction. It's a brilliant example of an author in control of her readers, as if she's saying: you think you understand, but do you? Really? Are you sure this isn't all just made-up? She's playing with our assumptions about who is the author, who is the narrator. It makes her angry when readers try to look for psychodramas in her background to explain the intensity of her books.</p> <p>\"The darkness is really out there,\" she says. \"It's not something that's in my head, just. It's in my work because it's in the world.\" Of course, she says, there must be some hook-in to something deeply personal if the book is going to work as art; but fiction is never the whole and literal truth. \"Take the Bront\u00ebs,\" she says. \"Was there really a Heathcliff? I doubt it very much. Maybe there was a proto-Heathcliff, or someone like Heathcliff, or someone glimpsed on a street corner one day. The passion was there, but it probably wasn't lived out in the way of their books. If you did, you probably wouldn't bother writing.\" </p> <p>This is quite a confession; confirmation - if any were needed - that writers don't have exciting lives, that her life isn't as eventful as her novels. But then, this is not much of a surprise. All reports of Atwood point to a full and happy personal life. Her parents liked each other; her father was an entomologist who studied forest insects, so she spent many of her early years learning how to live in the Canadian bush.</p> <p>At school a teacher said she showed \"no particular promise\", but it didn't matter: she loved books, Grimm, Poe, then Austen, then reading her own poems at a Toronto cafe called The Bohemian Embassy. Her father died of a stroke, but her mother is still alive at 92. She has a daughter, Jess, aged 24, who is a student of art history and who loves her mother's books. When she was 27, Atwood married James Polk, an American writer with a \"very entrancing mind\", but it lasted less than five years; she has lived, for the 28 years since, with fellow writer and fellow Canadian Graeme Gibson. </p> <p>Now then, Graeme Gibson. These are two people who fit well together. Graeme is a very tall, very big man with a huge white beard, a little yellow at the edges. He writes novels, which are moderately successful in Canada. He founded the Writer's Union, and the Canadian chapter of PEN, which fights for writers' human rights. He used to run bird-watching tours to Cuba. And this man exudes, bursts, beams with pride for his wife. </p> <p>While we're having lunch - we all drink ros\u00e9 in the sunshine - he tells a story about something that happened in Argentina. There was a reviewer on a live literary TV programme, completely trashing a woman writer's novel. It's garbage, says the reviewer - it's the biggest pile of garbage I've ever read. Anyway, the writer's husband was watching this live show at home. And he's furious, he's so furious that he gets into his car and drives to the studio and \"beats the shit\" out of the critic. \" 'Way to go!' That's what we were all saying!\" exclaims Graeme, laughing and punching the air. </p> <p>He would, of course, do exactly the same. </p> <p>Atwood herself is more relaxed when he's around, happy to let him be gregarious while she shields herself from the glare with her big floppy hat. She's always saying, \"Where's Graeme?\" or \"We must wait for Graeme.\" A British interviewer, quoting an American female novelist, once said \"every woman writer should be married to Graeme Gibson\". What did Atwood think of that? \"Oh, that was cute,\" she smiles. \"We got that put on to a T-shirt for him, in fact.\" </p> <p>This small intimacy is a little bit of Peggy coming out. Atwood was named Margaret, after her mother, but to avoid confusion she has always been known as Peggy to those close to her. (Torontonians don't ask whether or not you know Margaret Atwood; they ask whether you call her Margaret or Peggy.) It is Margaret who is usually on show in interviews - official, rather above it all, broadening everything out from the personal to the general. Why does she avoid getting personal in public? </p> <p>\"Oh, I can talk about all kinds of personal things, but they probably won't have anything to do with the book. It's the same as everyone else. It's factoid trivia. Am...erfectionist? No. Do I spend hours playing with my nails? No. But once in a while I file them so that they're even and sometimes I paint them, but I never bite them.\" But she goes out of her way to give interviewers nothing of herself. \"What do you mean, nothing?\" she says. \"There are some things that are not anyone else's business. You'd have to be quite strange to sit down and tell somebody everything about your entire life.\" People do. \"No they don't. They're giving you a facsimile of what you think is all about their life.\" </p> <p>Here it is, her double: the public and private personas, the real and unreal identities. The cold versus warm, the scary versus the approachable, the chilly reputation versus the personal guided tours of her Toronto. Margaret versus Peggy. \"I have a frivolous side,\" she once said, \"but you notice which name I use for writing. In a way, I had an alternate personality in reserve.\" Neither is her completely; she is both. </p> <p> And this is true of her narratives, too. In The Blind Assassin, Iris says of her sister, \"Laura was my left hand, and I was hers.\" In Alias Grace, her 1996 novel, the central character, a murderer called Grace, has amnesiac fits during which, she claims, she cannot be responsible for her actions. It was during one such episode that she committed her crime. Or did she? Nothing is easier to fake than amnesia. What is real, what is true? Atwood never tells us whether Grace has a split personality or is a very good liar - and who knows if the narrator is a reliable one? Zenia, in 1993's The Robber Bride, is both charming and evil; seductive and dangerous. And all these alternate personalities fit neatly with a comment Atwood once made that \"the national mental illness of Canada was schizophrenia\" - bilingual, always threatening to split in two. </p> <p>But Atwood does not agree that this is a feature peculiar to her work - partly, surely, because she pulls away from specific comments about her books in favour of broader comments about being \"human\" and hates to have her work categorised. (Asked the difference between her short stories and her novels, she said, \"short stories are short. Novels are long\".)</p> <p>\"Duality particularly interests fiction as a form,\" she says. \"It is particularly interesting from the word go - by which I mean Cain and Abel, Romulus and Remus. It's the structures of siblings. Look at Christianity - having had God, they had to have the Devil. I think it's the structure of the body and the brain. Two hands, two eyes, two halves of the brain - but one heart. This has been something that has interested people writing about being human. If we were millipedes, had a thousand legs and compound eyes, we'd write quite different books.\" </p> <p>Zenia, one of her most memorable characters, finds a way of hurting her closest women friends in horrific, emotionally devastating ways, exploiting their gravest fears, accessing them through their vulnerabilities. In Atwood's 1988 novel Cat's Eye, in childhood, Elaine's girlfriends, led by Cordelia, turn on her in terrifying ways that will affect her forever. Your friend is your enemy, your enemy your friend - and women, as they have always appeared in Atwood's novels, can be both.</p> <p>\"In real life, the best friend can be the worst enemy, because she can turn on you, ruin your life, steal your man,\" she says. \"It is life. There are mean girls. I think there was a period of time in the 70s when you weren't supposed to say that, when you were supposed to polarise things so that bad behaviour came from men. And even if some bad behaviour did come from women, then it was the fault of the patriarchy, and if the patriarchy wasn't there then all women would be nice. Well, I don't happen to believe that. There are all kinds of things that people do - and people do them, not boys or girls, even though they might do things in different ways. It's all about their struggles for power, survival, a position, self-definition. Chimpanzees do the same thing.\" </p> <p>Of course, the idea that women can be bad, and that women authors can write about bad women without betraying their sex, is commonplace now, and there are a great many serious women writers today, especially in Canada: it is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have been 29 in 1969, having published The Edible Woman, a feminist novel written before women's liberation kicked in, and have had interviewers ask you, \"Do men find you attractive?\" as one did. (Her reply, although she now denies it, was recorded as, \"Do women find you attractive? Because I don't.\")</p> <p>\"At that stage, you really were seen as a freak,\" she says. \"It was still the cusp of the women's movement. Reviews of The Edible Woman divided into people who hadn't caught up with the early women's movement and said this is a novel by a very young woman and she'll get more material later, and those who said this is cutting-edge feminism. Well, actually, it was not quite either one.\" </p> <p>This is an important point. Atwood is absolutely a feminist - many years of standing up for equality, supporting women workers, writing letters, protesting, testify to that. But that her books are feminist has sometimes been questioned - mainly because it is women who are evil in her fiction, not men. It could be argued, however, that her work is feminist in a much less literal and more mature sense, in that it features women who are good and bad, neat and messy; normal, damaged, whole, human. </p> <p>\"The idea of a female person writing - in fact, doing anything other than the traditional roles - it was very early days for that,\" she says. \"You were really seen as someone who was quite eccentric and peculiar.\" </p> <p>This was especially true in Canada. \"You have to take into account the colonial factor - Australians talk about having had \"cultural cringe\", because things come from elsewhere. The arts were very marginal then. Then, in the late 60s, you get this sudden upsurge, with all these people getting all this attention and getting into all the newspapers, and what are you going to say about them? What they usually said was: aren't they weird? It almost cancelled out the female weird - arty weird. </p> <p>\"In my early days of being interviewed on the radio, I'd get people saying, 'Why should I read your book?' or, 'Tell me in 25 words or less: what's the plot?' Or they'd kick off with, 'Haven't read your book, I'm not going to, but what's it about?' As far as they were concerned, I was just this jumped-up little shit. So of course they gave me a hard time. Things are quite pleasant for me these days, but what you see is the veteran of many battles.\" </p> <p>When Atwood said that she had a frivolous side, she was talking about Peggy, not Margaret, and I think I met both. We had a bit of fun, touring round Toronto. We ate a lot. She put on funny voices. When the photographer arrived, Atwood took off her hat, \"Because it looks stooooopid.\" She mimics a mad old lady: \" 'Who do you think you are, Greta Garbo?' \" There might even have been some jokes about strippers. She let me a little into the world of Peggy, a world Margaret-readers don't often get to see. </p> <p>But not that much. Even though I had all these personal experiences with Atwood - experiences that Canadian journalists I spoke to could hardly believe, said were unprecedented, totally out of character... I still didn't get that close to knowing who she is. She is so very good at the mirrors behind the mirrors. Perhaps there's a Margaret, for the world; a Peggy, for her friends (and the odd privileged acquaintance); and then a Pegs, the secret, private bit of her who only a few get to know. </p> <p>This is, of course, a very, very smart thing. Because, perhaps, if people knew her as Peggy or Pegs they wouldn't believe her books in the same way. Wouldn't knowing about her happy life spoil our understanding of Zenia's evil, of Cordelia's viciousness? If we knew the intricacies of her day-to-day domestic life with St Graeme, the garden, the cat, surely we would find it more difficult to be convinced by the emotional violence in her work? </p> <p>She does want us to know that her life isn't completely as painful as the novels. (She once said, \"Women see me as living proof that you don't have to come to a sticky end - put your head in an oven, stay silent for 30 years, not have children - to be a good and serious writer.\") And perhaps there is a deep, dark secret of some terrible pain that informs her most horrifying creations. But I doubt it. </p> <p>Instead, she plays up to the scary identity that has been constructed for and by her, in order to maintain Peggy's privacy. She likes her doubles: \"Everything has a positive space and a negative space. So there's you. And then there's the space that would be there if you weren't.\" She says, \"People shouldn't talk too much with authors, or they destroy their image of the writing.\" She has also said that \"self-definition is a kind of prison\".</p> <p>Atwood's life's work, for 30 years, has been about playing with reality, and she can take you to places you'd rather not go, in ways that few writers are able. She plays with reality in her fiction; she does it with her public persona, too. Why shouldn't Margaret Atwood, world-famous novelist, Canadian institution, be as much a construct as her heroines, her anti-heroines? The wry, deadpan humour belongs to both Peggy and Margaret, but Peggy keeps a lot in reserve for those she loves. </p> <p>So we're back to what's real and what's not. Atwood says that the Margaret who's the \"person on the big billboard... is sort of like having a twin who looks exactly like you, who is running around out of control. A lot of it is mythology.\" She doesn't want you to read her through her books, but she doesn't want you to read her through her interviews, either. She doesn't really want you to read her at all. What have you been doing reading this interview? Read her books instead.</p>",
  "<p>One of the first things Tom Fort does is apologise for the state of his lawn, as I knew he would, because, as he says in his new book, lawn people are never happy with the level, or the composition, or the general condition of their grass. </p> <p>To be fair, Fort isn't a full-on lawn man, more someone who has flirted with a cult and then drawn back after glimpsing a strange world populated by, among others, mower spotters and those who creep out at night to impale moles on garden forks. Both these feature in The Grass Is Greener: Our Love Affair With The Lawn. An obsessive love, then? </p> <p>Actually, no. You can tell from the lumps and bumps in his lawn that Fort has not gone over to the dark side. He is more interested in history than gardening tips, and chose the lawn as his subject because he was fascinated about how worked-up people - men, in particular - get about the grass. </p> <p>His book is all about one-upmanship; how national pride, social status, even sexual identity can be bound up in the greenness and smoothness of the grass. It is also about his own attempts to make a lawn: not a how-to book, more how-not-to. </p> <p>Fort is much more affable than I had been expecting after his on-page asides about figures such as the poet Alexander Pope (\"that stunted draper's son\"), smart-arsed presenters of gardening TV shows, garden columnists trotting out the same old advice year after year, even the way that \"wandering cats crap and bitches spray their discolouring piss\" on lawns, ruining the grass. A former radio news journalist (he quit after 22 years) and current angling correspondent for the Financial Times, he lives with his second wife, Helen, in an Oxfordshire village because he feels like he belongs in this part of England, though it's a \"geographical mischance\" that leaves them just the wrong side of the Berkshire border, where he was born. </p> <p>The scope of the book is vast, and shifts from the Cotswold wool industry to grand 18th-century estates to the golf-courses of 20s America, with thought-provoking views on the differences between men and women offered up alongside the historical research. These boil down to his belief that men love lawns because, like dogs, they repay love and attention, and women aren't bothered about lawns, apparently, because we aren't afraid to venture into the flowerbeds (\" terra incognita \" for men, writes Fort), where there is much more interesting gardening to be done. </p> <p>Fort tries to play down this side of the book: \"Women have got nothing against looking at a good lawn [as opposed to making one],\" he says. \"This is my view, and most of my views on most subjects are disputed by somebody. But the gender aspect didn't dawn on me so forcibly until I started talking to lawn people. The early research was from a historical angle. Here's an aspect of Anglo-Saxon life, but who invented it? And what did people do before the mower?\" </p> <p>It's true, there is a lot on the evolution of the motor mower in the book, but Fort's theories about the man behind the mower were always bound to provoke more of a reaction.\"I tried not to get too heavy about it, it was only a bit of fun,\" he says. \"The thing about grass cutting is that all the women I spoke to were grateful that they didn't have to do it, because it's intrinsically such an incredibly boring, pointless exercise.\" Man, on the other hand - Fort calls him a \"domesticated hunter-gatherer and demobilised warrior\" - was always going to head straight for anything that involved playing with some machine as soon as he got in the garden. \"The point is that it's harmless, unlike a lot of other things men do.\" </p> <p>Social psychologist Michael Argyle told Fort that \"his instinctive response on encountering a man with a keen enthusiasm for flowers would be to assume he was homosexual\". He made further enquiries with the eminent psychologist Halla Beloff, who confirmed that a liking for flowers, and skill at flowering arranging, were part of a traditional evaluation of sexual identity and orientation. Later, she got back to him with further thoughts on the subject - opening the conversation with the question,\"Have you considered the phallic dimension of mowing?\" Her thinking was that pushing out all that thrusting, throbbing motor mower in front of you, cutting a swathe through the rampaging grass and making nice straight lines fits the male desire to feel potent and to change the world. </p> <p>Fort asked lawnsman and novelist Jim Crace about this impulse: \"Crace thought it sprang from a deeply imprinted desire to control and domesticate nature. It was, he agreed, a purely masculine province, legitimised by being distinct from housework.\" </p> <p>Fort is at his best when he shows how mowing became central to the 20th-century suburban code in this country and in America, or, as the magazine Better Homes &amp; Gardens put it, \"Not to mow is to attack one's neighbours, lowering the value of their homes and calling into question the integrity of the street.\" </p> <p>There are also autobiographical breaks, in which Fort talks about childhood games of cricket and football with two of his three brothers, James and Matthew (now Guardian food and drink editor) - the third brother, Johnny, preferred his train set, while sister Elizabeth was too young - when they used two cigar-shaped yew bushes as goal-posts and infuriated their mother, \"a very keen and accomplished gardener\", with direct hits on the greenhouse or, worse, on her. </p> <p>A brief but telling reference is made to the death of their father when Tom was eight, and the subsequent way that he was initiated into lawncare by his elder brothers and the family odd-job man, Albert. \"My father was an MP, but he was untypical - he wasn't like today's breed of career politician; he did it because he wanted to be of service to his country, and similarly clapped-out old ideas of the past. The mower, a 24-inch Dennis, was his purchase; it was just a fantastic machine.\" </p> <p>His descriptions of the mowing ritual are evocative, recognisable to anyone whose teeth have been set on edge by the gritty sound of the mower being rolled across concrete, or who knows the musty smell of the shed or the sweet warmth of decomposing grass. </p> <p>Jim Crace lost his father, too, and found himself taking on his father's duties, including a fanatical zeal for lawncare, as he lay dying. Crace's theory is that, in the transition from boy to man, by taking on lawncare, men turn into their fathers. </p> <p>So, did a Crace-style rite of passage occur a couple of years ago when Tom Fort made his lawn? \"I'm never sure what a rite of passage is supposed to be,\" he says. \"My son has just come back from Ayia Napa in Cyprus, which is widely described as a rite of passage, which appears to me to be drinking and throwing up all night. So, no, I don't think of it like that,\" he says. </p> <p>Fort's favourite lawns are at Chatsworth House, on the east side, in front of Paxton's cascade, where an incredible range of wildflower species, hidden for centuries in the turf, are being allowed to flourish instead of being killed off by chemicals or scarified out. Perhaps with this, and the trend towards wildflower meadows and new perennial planting on both sides of the Atlantic, the orthodox lawn is fast becoming another clapped-out old idea of the past. </p> <p>Whatever the case, once hooked, the lawn can be an addiction. Fort keeps promising himself that he is not going to bother with his unruly lawn any more. \"I've spent hours on it to no good effect,\" he says. \"But then I thought, at the end of the year I'll do a proper top dressing, then some scarifying, and then , if it's no good, I'll give up.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Grass Is Greener, by Tom Fort, is published by Harper Collins priced \u00a312.99.</p>",

He draws heavily on film for inspiration, particularly Clint Eastwood as embodiment of the Puritan struggle and the flawed machismo and high fire-power of Sam Peckinpah. <strong> Hot Springs </strong> (Century, \u00a317.99) <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502451505,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> features his regular crack shot Earl Swagger, demon-driven and given to improbable heroics. Suffering post-second world war depression, Swagger gets back in the killing groove when hired to clean up an Arkansas gambling town. Hunter does a professional job, but this is coarser and more cartoonish than his best work, full of set-piece slaughter, pat psychology, twinkling villains and laughably stoic women. </p> <p>Like Hunter, George P Pelecanos is from Washington and has a film background. Unlike Hunter, he is an urban creature and spends more time describing natty shoes than guns; he also gives believable meaning to the trajectories of ordinary lives. The big mystery about <strong> The Big Blowdown </strong> (Serpent's Tail, \u00a310) <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502440985,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> is why it has taken four years to get published here when Pelecanos is widely regarded as one of the best young American writers, and when this novel is one of his best. Set in Washington between 1933 and 1959, The Big Blowdown plays mainly as a post-war blues about a homecoming gone wrong. As always with Pelecanos, the prose is just dandy; the story unfolds to the beat of the city and a jukebox of hits, with the emphasis on racial mix and the overlap of retail and criminal enterprise (Greek diners and protection rackets; bars and pimping). After half a dozen interlocking novels, Pelecanos appears to be producing one of the great contemporary bodies of work. </p> <p>Where Pelecanos is a writer of texture and ambition, Faye Kellerman offers little beyond formula and the odd chatty insight. The slack ease of the writing extends to lazy plotting that relies on coincidence and wild surmise. She also does a rotten red herring. </p> <p> <strong> Stalker</strong> (Headline Feature, \u00a317.99) <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502440574,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> doesn't really feature a stalker at all - more an inside case of unresolved police work that has a mustard-keen female rookie (irritating) trying to distinguish between regular departmental male chauvinism (irritating) and more specific harassment. Kellerman's bag is LA bland, and her political correctness comes at the expense of believable motivation. The villains are all routinely ugly. </p> <p>After her husband is stung to death by a bee, modest Anna discovers the extent to which his life and their marriage were built on lies. She also finds herself exposed to a fanciful obsessive who orchestrates her widowhood in increasingly creepy ways, encouraged at first by her masochism. Julie Parsons's <strong> The Courtship Gift </strong> (Pan, \u00a35.99) <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501021896,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> is set in a world of natural predators and victims whose initial curiosity serves merely to spring the trap. This Dublin tale is reminiscent of Ruth Rendell in its general nastiness, but her eye for how the ordinary turns extraordinary owes something to Patricia Highsmith, although Parsons is more Gothic in her liking for horror and twists and lacks some of Highsmith's relentless exposure of human motivation. </p> <p>Kathy Reichs is pretty much a push-button, middle-range formula writer, providing middle-class weekend reading.

  "A man alleged to be the top military commander of the Basque separatist group Eta was arrested in south-west France yesterday as police struck a fresh blow against the outlawed organisation. <p>Ignacio Gracia Arregui, 45, was seized in the town of Bidart with his girlfriend and a third person in an operation carried out jointly by French and Spanish police. The couple were with their two-year-old daughter when police burst into their flat. Other arrests were expected as the crackdown on Eta members, promised by Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, continued. Security forces would \"continue their tenacious efforts\", he said earlier this week, after 20 of the group's main strategists and fundraisers were taken into custody in Spain.</p> <p>Eta's top leaders have always preferred to base themselves in the French Basque country where, for a time, they enjoyed protection. In 1987, French authorities lifted the immunity they had given Mr Arregui as a political refugee from General Franco's dictatorship. Yesterday's arrest was described by Spain's interior minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, as \"a model of cooperation between French and Spanish police\".</p> <p>Mr Arregui, known colloquially as \"Inaki de Renteria\", after the small Basque town where he was born, allegedly took control of Eta's commandos in 1992 when the previous leadership was rounded up. Magistrates at Spain's national court, set up to try terrorist offences, accuse him of planning an assasination attempt on King Juan Carlos in 1995, foiled by police three years later. He is thought to have joined Eta in 1975, when he was barely 20 years old, and has remained a hardline activist ever since, unlike other veterans who renounced violence when Spain became a democracy and the Basque country was granted a measure of self-government.</p> <p>Mr Arregui's arrest follows a period of intense Eta violence. Twelve people have died since the group broke a 14-month truce at the start of the year.</p>",
  "Senior Russian and Swiss law officers began talks yesterday on Swiss claims that an Isle of Man branch of the Midland Bank was used to pass $25m in bribes to the man who helped President Vladimir Putin to power. <p>The Swiss federal prosecutor, Valentin Roschacher, flew to Moscow to press his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Ustinov, to speed up the probe.</p> <p>A Swiss document given to the Russians in July, and leaked to newspapers in Italy and Russia this week, alleged that Pavel Borodin, the former Kremlin property manager who Mr Putin says recruited him into the Kremlin in 1996, received more than $25m (\u00a317.8m) for awarding contracts to refurbish the Kremlin and other government offices.</p> <p>In all, $62.5m was paid in bribes for contracts worth $492m, it is alleged. Mr Borodin's share - $25,609,978 - was paid into the Midland (now HSBC) account on the Isle of Man of Lightstar Low Voltage Systems Ltd, the Swiss document says. </p> <p>Mr Borodin, his daughter, Yekaterina Siletsky, and his son-in-law, Andrei Siletsky, had the money transferred to their accounts in Geneva, Nassau and Guernsey in four payments between March 1997 and August 1998, the document by a Swiss investigating magistrate, Daniel Devaud, alleges.</p> <p>\"The elements collated to date show that [Mr Borodin and 13 others] may be seriously suspected of using the Swiss banking system to conceal money obtained through crimes committed in the Russian federation,\" it adds.</p> <p>\"The above mentioned persons are suspected of taking part in dishonest management of state property or state interests, or of taking bribes.\"</p> <p>The Swiss general prosecutor, Bernard Bertossa, has opened a criminal investigation into charges of money-laundering, it adds.</p> <p>The 12-page document details the banks, their location, the account numbers, and the dates of the alleged transactions involved in what has become known as the Mabetex affair, although the Swiss authorities now call it \"the presidential administration-Mabetex affair''.</p> <p>The contracts to refurbish the Kremlin were awarded by Mr Borodin to two Swiss-based sister companies: Mabetex, owned by a Kosovo Albanian, and Mercata Trading and Engineering, run by a Russian businessman, Viktor Stolpovskikh, who also owned Lightstar and set up the Isle of Man account.</p> <p>In January, a year after the investigation began, the Swiss issued an international arrest warrant for Mr Borodin. One of Mr Putin's first acts on becoming president on New Year's Eve was to move him out of the Kremlin, making him secretary of the Russia-Belarus union.</p> <p>Mr Borodin denies the charges and the Russian prosecutor's office has exasperated the Swiss by playing for time. The unprecedented leak of the Swiss document on the eve of Mr Roschacher's visit to Moscow was seen as a mark of their frustration.</p> <p>\"Devaud is asking the Russians to help, but he's going a step further by sending them a dossier on the case which they didn't ask for. It's a bit like saying, look, investigate,'' said Dominique Poncet, a Geneva lawyer acting for Mr Borodin.</p> <p>The Swiss will have difficulty bringing a successful prosecution unless the Russians say their laws have been broken and that the \"commissions\" paid to Mr Borodin and others were illicit. But Mr Ustinov, appointed by Mr Putin earlier this year, has yet to order a criminal investigation.</p> <p>The Swiss document asks the Russians to say whether \"the activities described are in breach of Russian criminal law on taking bribes and/or abusing power, or any other criminal laws\".</p> <p>Mr Borodin's office is said to have paid Mercata Trading $492m for refurbishing the Kremlin and the Chamber of Audits in Moscow. Mercata transferred $62.5m to the Lightstar Isle of Man account.</p> <p>The Swiss document makes only passing reference to Mabetex, despite earlier allegations that its boss, Beghjet Pacolli, provided credit cards to the Yeltsin family in return for winning the contracts.</p> <p>The Russian prosecutor's office confirmed this week that it had received the Swiss document, but said it would not respond to papers received by fax. Mr Devaud said he had sent it by fax \"because of the urgency and nature of the case\u0085 and to speed up the investigation\".</p> <p>But the signs are that Mr Ustinov is under orders to block the investigation. In addition to the Borodin scandal, Mr Roschacher is believed to have brought papers on the alleged embezzlement of more than $900m in receipts of the Russian airline Aeroflot, and its siphoning into two companies in Switzerland controlled by Boris Berezovsky, the Yeltsin associate and business and media mogul. </p> <p>Yuri Volkov, the official in charge of the Berezovsky investigation, was sacked last month after returning from Switzerland with crates of documents on the affair, which he said would have enabled him to wind up the inquiry later this year. Several other senior officials in the prosecutor's office, including Mr Ustinov's predecessor, Yury Skuratov, were also sacked.</p> <p>A man resembling Mr Skuratov was filmed by the domestic security service, then headed by Mr Putin, in a sex romp with two prostitutes. The film was shown on state television.</p> <p>Mr Volkov said this week that he could prove that $580m of Aeroflot receipts had been siphoned off to Andava, a financial services company in Switzerland believed to be controlled by Mr Berezovsky, between 1996 and 1999, and that he knew the names of those who had stolen $35m of it.</p> <p><b>Who, what, where and when</b><br></p> <p>Swiss allegations<br> In August 1996 Pavel Borodin's office awarded two contracts worth $492m for refurbishing the Kremlin and Moscow's Chamber of Audits to the Swiss-based Mercata Trading and Engineering, a shell company bought in 1995 by the Russian businessman Viktor Stolpovskikh. Its sister company Mabetex did the work. Stolpovskikh also bought Lightstar Low Voltage Systems Ltd, registered on the Isle of Man. His two companies signed a \"service agreement\" in May 1996 to handle the Kremlin contracts. Borodin's office paid $492m to Mercata, which passed on $62.5m to Lighthouse at a Midland Bank account on the Isle of Man. These were the \"commissions\" paid to several of the 14 suspects named by the Swiss investigation, including Borodin, his daughter and her husband, who between them received $25,609,978 in four payments to accounts in Geneva, Nassau, and Guernsey in 1997-98. Mabetex's boss, Beghjet Pacolli, is said to have guaranteed five credit cards for members of Boris Yeltsin's family. His bank, Banco del Gottardo in Lugano, said it had issued guarantees for them.</p> <p>The Aeroflot case<br> Last July, Swiss investigators raided the premises of two financial services companies in Lausanne, Forus and Andava, said to be controlled by the Russian mogul Boris Berezovsky and suspected of siphoning funds from Aeroflot. Yeltsin's son-in-law, Valery Okulov, heads Aeroflot. Russian information supplied to the Swiss suggested that $600m was involved. The sum is now suspected to exceed $900m.</p> <p>Aeroflot refused to cooperate with the investigation. The assets of the two firms in Switzerland were frozen. Berezovsky was barred from the country and the Russians issued an arrest warrant, later dropped.</p>",
  "The public will not be allowed access to names and addresses on the sex offenders register under the measures unveiled yesterday to provide greater protection for children against paedophiles. <p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, has held out against the change despite a campaign by the parents of the murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne for a \"Sarah's law\", modelled on the US \"Megan's law\", which would give parents access to details of sex offenders in their area. </p> <p>Mr Straw said he had considered some form of controlled access to the register but had concluded that this would not be possible and would not help to protect children. </p> <p>But Stuart Kuttner, managing editor of the News of the World, which had mounted a campaign for parents to have access to the register, said he would not rule out publishing more photographs, names and addresses of alleged paedophiles. </p> <p>In some US states, laws introduced after the murder of a Californian girl, Megan Kanka, allow names and addresses of paedophiles to be accessed through police websites or CD-roms in police stations. But in Britain police, probation and child protection agencies opposed the move, warning that it would risk driving paedophiles underground. </p> <p>Instead, police and probation services will be put under a new statutory duty to set up risk assessment and monitoring programmes for violent and sex offenders released into the community. </p> <p>To reassure the public, police will be able to publicise the measures they take to manage risk. But it will be left to police and probation officers to decide whether to notify neighbours or headteachers about the presence of a paedophile. Such steps may be publicised, but not the offender's name or address. </p> <p>A new statutory duty will be imposed on the probation service to ask victims of violent crime or sex offenders if they want to be informed of arrangements for the offender's release. If so, they will be told of the release date and any restrictions in place after release. </p> <p>The measures should be in force next year. Those requiring legislation will be included in the criminal justice and court services bill, currently in committee stage in the Lords. </p> <p>Sara and Michael Payne, of Hersham, Surrey, met Mr Straw and the Home Office minister Paul Boateng this week and handed in a 700,000-name petition for a Sarah's law. Sarah was abducted in July after a day on the beach in West Sussex. </p> <p>Ms Payne said yesterday: \"We're quite pleased that we have managed to get 60% of Sarah's law and Michael and I will carry on the campaign to get 100%.\"</p>",
  "In a sign of increasing desperation in the White House to forge a Middle East peace deal before President Bill Clinton leaves office, the US ambassador to Israel yesterday urged Israel to share Jerusalem with the Palestinians. <p>Martin Indyk's remarks marked a sharp departure from Washington orthodoxy in recent years, which has been to make no judgment on the future of the holy city, leaving the decision to the outcome of Israeli-Arab negotiations. </p> <p>It appeared to represent an attempt to support the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, who is under fire from right-wingers over his readiness to discuss shared sovereignty at the Camp David talks in July. Those talks broke down over the fate of Jerusalem. </p> <p>The White House is aware it only has a few weeks left to clinch a deal before a resolution of the conflict is put off until a new US administration comes to office next year. </p> <p>However, the gambit could have a political price in the US, where Jewish voters have traditionally punished any attempt to put pressure on Israel to split the city. In particular, it could cost Hillary Clinton votes in the New York Senate race, unless she radically distances herself from Mr Indyk's statement. </p> <p>Speaking as he received an honorary doctorate from Hebrew Union College, Mr Indyk said: \"There is no other solution but to share the holy city.\" </p> <p>The Australian-born US ambassador, at the centre of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks for the past eight years, said Jerusalem \"is not, and cannot be, the exclusive preserve of one religion, and the solution cannot come from one side challenging or denying another side's beliefs\". </p> <p>Khalil Jahshan, of the American Committee on Jerusalem, which supports the sharing of the holy city, said: \"We are delighted to see a representative of the US government saying publicly what we have heard privately - that there should be a settlement by which all national aspirations are accommodated.\" </p> <p>After Israel gained control of the whole city in 1967, the US and Europe viewed the eastern Palestinian districts as occupied territory. But under Ronald Reagan, Washington began to talk about possibly moving the US embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as recognition of its Jewish identity. Mr Clinton revived that possibility a few weeks ago to put pressure on the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. </p> <p>The secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, began a new round of peace talks yesterday. Asked about their progress, Mr Clinton said: \"Everyone is working hard. But I have nothing to report. You should be encouraged only by the fact that they are working. But there are no breakthroughs, no reason for hope, no reason for despair.\"</p>",
  "<p>Scientists will urge the government to set up a guard against destruction from outer space, in an official report to be published on Monday. A task force will report that collisions with \"near earth objects\" such as asteroids and comets are no longer the stuff of science fiction: they represent a real threat. A collision with one the size of a small village could wipe out a third of the human race. </p> <p>A 100-metre object crashes into the planet every 10,000 years - triggering a 100 megaton explosion in the air, larger than the largest H-bomb ever tested. A 1km object scores a direct hit on the planet every 100,000 years - with the force of 10m Hiroshimas. </p> <p>The near earth objects task force, led by Professor Harry Atkinson, a scientist who has worked both for the European space agency and Nasa, was set up in January to consider the growing evidence of danger and to take advice from astronomers. </p> <p>His report will urge the government to release \u00a320m for a new telescope in the southern hemisphere to comb the skies, and to \"buy\" time on a network of new or existing telescopes in Australia, Hawaii and the Canary islands to track the solar system's \"loose cannons\". The task force - made up of Prof Atkinson, Sir Crispin Tickell, the former British ambassador to the UN, and Professor David Williams of University College, London - will also recommend close partnerships with European and US astronomers to ensure systematic global coverage. </p> <p>The report will suggest support for space-based instruments to sweep the skies for potential cosmic traffic accidents and British involvement in European and US satellites which could rendezvous with asteroids far away and study them more closely. And it is expected to urge a kind of British \"spaceguard\" research centre, perhaps at the Armagh observatory in Northern Ireland, to keep disaster experts, astronomers, media and government in touch with each other. </p> <p>One problem is that the US - which funds a \"minor planet centre\" at Harvard - controls the detailed astronomical information from observers all over the world. The report could urge that Britain share some of the cost. \"It's an unhealthy state of affairs even if the US is an ally, when one country controls the information,\" said one researcher. </p> <p>Objects from space hit the earth all the time - at speeds of more than 10 miles a second. Most burn up harmlessly, as shooting stars. Hundreds have landed as small rocks. There is no record of any human being killed by a comet or asteroid - but a large one could destroy civilisation. The aim, the task force report will say, is to detect a potential collision years or, better still, decades in advance, giving governments of the world time to take measures. </p> <p>\"What they are talking about is setting in motion ways in which we could really deflect one of these things. That is the contentious one, because that involves nuclear weapons,\" said one astronomer last night. \"It doesn't say that, but we know it does. If you are going to deflect one, you have got to use a nuclear weapon. There is no other way to do it.\" </p> <p>This would mean launching a robot spacecraft to meet an asteroid, and then triggering a precisely calculated explosion which would knock it off course so that it would miss its date with the earth. </p> <p>Other bodies in the solar system are pock-marked by asteroid craters. The earth's asteroid scars have been removed by erosion - but there have been a number of collisions identified by planetary scientists. The most famous coincided with the death of the dinosaurs 65m years ago, but a 100-metre object exploded over Siberia in 1908 and wiped out 2,000 sq miles of forest. Two large asteroids have passed alarmingly close to earth in the last few years. US and French astronomers recently calculated that 900 asteroids, all 1km across or larger, are whizzing around the solar system on orbits that cross that of the earth. But Europeans want to start tracking smaller objects. </p> <p>\"A 200-metre object plonking into the Atlantic would effectively take out all the cities around the seaboards. Those smaller events occur rather more fre quently - they are talking about a once every several thousand years event,\" said Duncan Steel of the University of Salford, one of the leading authorities on asteroids and comets. \"The report highlights the way in which Britain can make a real contribution to the international programme - in essence to become No 2 in the world, behind the US. This would put the UK in a Europe-leading role.\" </p> <p>Jonathan Tate, a British army officer who several years ago began pressing for governments to take the threat from space seriously, is the director of SpaceGuard UK. He argued that a crash from a 1km asteroid - a one-in-100,000-years event - could kill 25-30% of the human race within a year. Assuming a UK population of 60m when it happened, that would work out at an average of 150 deaths a year over that 100,000-year period. One authority values a human life at \u00a3850,000. </p> <p>\"That actually works out at \u00a3123m a year to do nothing,\" he said. \"One of the major effects of this report will be to dispel, for once and for all, the giggle factor associated with the impact hazard. No sane person can any longer regard this as either funny or science fiction.\" </p> <p>Lembit Opik, the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire, has been pushing the government to take the issue seriously for two years. \"If the report confirms a clear and present danger of an impact of global significance, and that we can do something about it with today's technology, I shall be happy,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p><strong>Space invaders</strong></p> <p> A <strong> comet</strong> is part of the builder's rubble left over from the making of the planets. Comets live at the far edge of the solar system and every so often are dislodged into long orbits round the <strong> sun</strong> , occasionally crashing into one of the planets in the way. </p> <p><strong> Asteroids</strong> - believed to be the fragments of a planet that never formed - live in a belt between <strong> Mars</strong> and <strong> Jupiter</strong> and every now and then one is tipped into a different flight path. </p> <p>Experts at Cornell University calculate the earth is at the centre of a network of asteroid \"superhighways\" and that a collision is inevitable at some point in the future. They know of 900 asteroids of 1km or more that could smash into the earth. But they calculate that there could be as many again yet to be detected. </p> <p>Asteroids are believed to be hard, stony, heavy objects rich in metals. There are commercial plans to \"quarry\" them in space and there are several space missions to explore asteroids and comets. </p> <p>Comets are mostly ice and dust and tend to break up under the gravitational tug of a big planet or the sun. Fascinated astronomers watched a dozen fragments of <strong> Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</strong> crash one at a time into <strong> Jupiter</strong> in 1994. </p> <p>A large asteroid that hit the earth at 10 miles a second would turn into a fireball, sending sonic booms and shockwaves through the atmosphere. If it hit solid earth, it would form a crater 10 times its own size and the shockwave would level brick walls thousands of miles away. A big one would set the skies alight, and then shower the stratosphere with dust, blotting out the sun, shutting down all plant growth and condemning those who survived the shock and fire to death by cold and starvation.</p>",
  "<p>President Bill Clinton has been asked to intervene in a battle between environmentalists seeking to save an endangered species of sea lion and the US fishing industry, which claims that the protesters' legal action is costing the industry millions of dollars and threatening thousands of jobs. </p> <p>An injunction preventing fishing fleets from trawling in areas off the Alaskan coast has drawn the governor of Alaska into an angry row with environmentalists who say they have been forced to resort to the law to save a dying species. </p> <p>The dispute is among a growing number of such clashes as commercial fleets compete aggressively for diminishing harvests around the world. </p> <p>The number of Steller sea lions in the Alaska region has fallen by 80% in the last 35 years, from 230,000 in 1965 to 34,000 now. </p> <p>Measuring 10ft in length and weighing more than a tonne, the sea lions require huge quantities of fish to survive and their decline has accompanied a rise in the catch numbers of pollock - a main source of fish served in fast food restaurant chains - on which the sea lions depend. </p> <p>The national marine fisheries service (NMFS) has a duty both to protect such species and the interests of the fishing industry. It is what has been judged in court as a failure to carry out the former function that has prompted the action by the environmentalists. </p> <p>Last month, the American Oceans Campaign, Greenpeace and the Sierra Club won the ground-breaking injunction in the US district court in Seattle, which ruled that trawling for pollock, cod and other fish caused a \"reasonably certain threat of imminent harm\" to the Steller sea lions, which are protected under the Endangered Species Act </p> <p>The first part of the injunction came into force last month. It will be enacted further on October 1, at the start of the latest phase of the pollock fishing season in the area. </p> <p>This is the first time that such a injunction - protecting the \"critical habitat\" of a species - has been won and it has provoked an angry reaction from the US government and the fishing industry. </p> <p>The acting commerce secretary, Robert Mallett, said in a statement: \"We are extremely disappointed. While we recognise the need to protect endangered Steller sea lions, we're concerned that this injunction will have a severe im pact on Alaska coastal communities.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The impacts will be greatest on fishermen using smaller vessels, in particular Alaska native fisherman.\" </p> <p>The industry body, the At-Sea Processors' Association, claim that more than $250m (\u00a3177m) in revenue could be lost and many jobs affected. The governor of Alaska, Tony Knowles, has written a personal letter to Mr Clinton asking him to intervene. </p> <p>Janis Searles, lawyer for the Earthjustice Legal Defence Fund which is representing the environmental groups, said the injunction had been necessary because the NMFS had failed to come up with a solution to the crisis. She said environmentalists were aware of the problems faced by local fishermen, some of whom have claimed they will have to fish in more dangerous waters. </p> <p>\"We do not want fishermen to be faced with the Hobson's choice of fishing in conditions that they do not want to fish in or not fishing at all. The fact is that there is a race for fish and there are too many boats out there. This has nothing to do with the Steller sea lions but everything to do with overcapacity,\" she said, adding that the onus was on the NMFS to come up with a solution. </p> <p>Phil Kline, a former fisherman who is now with the American Oceans Campaign, denied that the environmentalists were \"anti-fishing\". </p> <p>\"We are very much in favour of a healthy eco-system and we believe that small community-based fleets are going to be the most sustainable. We are not out to 'get' fishing. The Stellers are being used as a scapegoat to mask the mismanagement of the fishery industry over a long period of time\".</p>",
  "A tycoon who decided to support Labour when it promised to change the quarantine laws is putting \u00a32m into the first of the government's city academies. <p>Frank Lowe, chairman of the Lowe Group and Octagon sports marketing, will join the board of governors of the city academy being set up on the site of Willesden high school, north-west London, which was failed by Ofsted inspectors two years ago. He will fund a fifth of a \u00a310m renovation, with the rest of the money coming from the government. </p> <p>He said yesterday that he hoped some of his clients, who include tennis player Anna Kournikova and footballer Gareth Southgate, would visit the school. He is planning a trip for the school to the world superbike championships at Brand's Hatch. </p> <p>Mr Lowe, 59, said he had backed Labour at the election because the party, unlike the Conservatives, gave a firm commitment to change quarantine regulations. He wanted his family to be able to bring their dogs back to the UK from his home in Switzerland. \"I am not very political,\" he said. </p> <p>He was telephoned six months ago by Andrew Adonis, the prime minister's education adviser in the Downing Street policy unit, and asked if he would be interested in funding a specialist sports academy. </p> <p>Mr Lowe, the son of an RAF officer and an opera singer, spent much of his early life in Manchester before attending Westminster school. His mother has lived in Brondesbury Park, near the academy site, for nearly 40 years. </p> <p>He plans to rebuild the basketball courts and playing fields, and experts from his company have been to the school to upgrade its computers. \"I started off with the idea that I have been fortunate in my life in terms of business ... I thought, wouldn't it be nice to do something for others?\" he said. \"There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that education is the most important thing for our country.\" </p> <p>Mr Lowe described the new head teacher of Willesden high, Frank Thomas, as terrific, adding: \"I have no knowledge of education in the sense of how to run a school, but I might be able to help, I might be able to inspire a few of the children.\" </p> <p>He said he was mystified by criticism of the city academies, which David Blunkett, the education secretary, said yesterday would be funded by a mixture of private and central government money. </p> <p>The academies will be put outside local authority control and take on charitable status, with a private board of governors that will set the salaries and conditions of staff. </p> <p>There would be two more city academies in Lambeth, south London, and in Liverpool, but in both cases plans were at an early stage. Three more will be announced by the end of the year. </p> <p>In Lambeth CfBT education services, a charity, is in discussion with the council over injecting finance but has not yet decided how to do so. In Liverpool the Anglican bishop, James Jones, said the diocese was interested in setting up a city academy, although a site had not been found. </p> <p>Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"After six months the government has got one plan to have the building completed by 2002, and others announced in such a vague way that it is of no benefit to anyone.\" </p> <p>City academies will be allowed to select up to 10% of pupils on ability. Theresa May, the shadow education secretary, said they were an \"admission of the failure of the government's policy on failing schools\".</p>",
  "Tens of millions of pounds might need to be spent to defend large areas of internationally renowned wetlands from floods caused by global warming, a report has warned. <p>The environment agency says councils might have to triple their flood defence budgets to prevent the low-lying Somerset levels and other parts of Somerset becoming swamped.</p> <p>In a paper to be discussed by the local flood defence committee next week, the agency estimates that councils could face a \u00a370m bill over the next 10 years.</p> <p>Somerset county council and North Somerset council will have to decide whether they can ask local council tax payers to foot the bill.</p> <p>About one fifth of the area is at or below sea level and is surrounded by five ranges of hills which drain into the levels. Seventy miles of coastline run along the Severn estuary, which has the world's second highest tidal range.</p> <p>The area has been hit by severe floods in 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999 and this year, and the report acknowledges that opinion is divided on how much of the problem can be blamed on climate change.</p> <p>It notes that 34 towns and villages depend on flood defences and that almost 37,000 homes are at risk. Fifteen towns and villages are protected by river and sea defences which fall below recommended standards.</p> <p>Stone Age dwellers built trackways across the levels and the Romans began attempts to protect the area from inroads by the sea. River defences were introduced by church bodies in the early middle ages and land drainage systems were introducedin the 18th and 19th centuries.</p> <p>\"Because man has interfered with nature over thousands of years an artificial landscape has been created which now has an internationally recognised conservation value,\" said Martin Weiler of the environment agency.</p> <p>\"International law says we have to conserve what is there. There is a tension between our need to protect the landscape and what nature is now throwing at us.\"</p> <p>Richard Bradford, Somerset county council's project officer for the county's moors and levels, said the paper was an attempt to raise awareness of the financial problems councils face.</p> <p>\"We have a problem which a single authority is not able to tackle alone,\" he said. \"The question is whether the responsibility should fall on local council taxpayers or whether the country's taxpayers should help because of the international importance of our sites.</p> <p>\"The flooding in recent years has brought the problem very much to mind.\"</p>",
  "Train operating companies were yesterday warned to get on with fitting data recorders or automatic warning systems in drivers' cabs, following the Southall train crash three years ago. <p>The health and safety commission said it would ask the government to legislate and make the companies act if they failed to speed up the process. Bill Callaghan, the commission's chairman, said it would not hesitate to intervene \"if commitments are broken or timetables slip.\" </p> <p>He assured families of the seven killed and 139 injured in the crash that safety improvements drawn up subsequently would be vigorously pursued. Legislation would be introduced where promises could not be delivered. </p> <p>The commission is furious at the failure to install data recorders. The Southall report said that this should be achieved by 2002, but the companies say that it cannot be done before 2005. The Association of Train Operating Companies said an independent report found that 2002 was too drastic, requiring \"a massive withdrawal of the fleet at any given time, leading to huge delays and considerable overcrowding\". </p> <p>The commission is also watching progress on automatic warning systems, whose failure was a contributory cause of the crash. </p> <p>Passengers on the train, and at the Paddington crash last year, complained about some of the emergency evacuation equipment, particularly hammers for breaking windows. The commission is arguing with some companies, which say hammers are sometimes used by vandals to attack passengers or damage trains. Central Trains, based at Birmingham, has withdrawn them.</p>",
  "<p>The search for petrol may be at the front of our minds this weekend. But for those who want distraction, there is another big problem to worry about. We in Britain should take the threat more seriously of collision with large rocks from space. </p> <p>Last December 30, lost among the millennium celebrations, Lord Sainsbury announced the formation of a top-level task force consisting of Sir Crispin Tickell, Dr Harry Atkinson and Professor David Williams, to investigate the asteroid hazard. Their report is due to be published on Monday. They are to confirm that the hazard we face is not trivial, and to recommend a suite of actions that the UK might implement, as a participant in a global programme aimed at ensuring that we are not taken unawares. </p> <p>Although the US is by far the dominant player in this field, the UK is well placed to lead European efforts to tackle this surprising danger. We must secure the future of the human race against attack from above. </p> <p>We have got all our eggs stored in one basket. It's called the Earth. We must keep it safe. The dinosaurs couldn't see their nemesis coming. We can, and having realised the danger it would be negligent of us to adopt an ostrich-like stance. </p> <p>Forget, for the moment, Bruce Willis and the other heroes of those cosmic disaster movies Armageddon and Deep Impact. The way the universe really works is this. In our yearly orbit around the Sun, many space rocks pass us by. Some are large, some small. Some come near, but most keep their distance. The Earth collects about 40,000 tons of celestial debris each year, mainly tiny grains producing the familiar shooting stars seen on a dark night. But every so often a whopper slams into us. </p> <p>Of concern are those bigger than about a kilometre: maybe a mile at the outside. A crater 10 miles wide and several miles deep would be excavated by one of these. By dint of the extreme speed, the energy released on impact would be equivalent to about 100,000 megatons of TNT. Around 10m times the Hiroshima bomb. </p> <p>This is the threshold at which a global upset of the environment would be caused (putting it mildly), and we may expect at least a quarter of the human race to perish. How often might that happen? Answer: about once every 100,000 years. </p> <p>Now, is that anything to be concerned about? As a scientist, I have to compare it against other risks. If the kill-rate is one in four people, the chance of dying that way is one in 400,000 per annum. If you have a remaining life expectancy of 40 years, this means there is a one in 10,000 probability that an asteroid catastrophe will end your days. Statistics for airline disasters indicate that the average westerner's chance of dying in a plane crash is around one in 30,000. So asteroids are more dangerous than jetliners. We spend billions on the latter, and essentially nothing on the former. </p> <p>Compare the risk against other major catastrophes, such as nuclear power stations or chemical plants exploding. The government has safety guidelines for such things. Take that one chance in 100,000 per annum level of occurrence as reference: the guidelines say that if some accident has that likelihood and it would kill more than 100 people, then money should be spent if it is feasible to reduce the risk. If the death expectancy is more than 10,000, then the risk is defined as being \"intolerable\", and it must be tackled. </p> <p>A massive asteroid impact anywhere around the globe has that annual probability, and no matter where it hits one may expect more than 10m Britons to die. The safety guidelines indicate, then, that this is super-intolerable. The government must act. </p> <p>The average voter still thinks people such as I are joking when we argue that there is a significant hazard posed by asteroids running into the Earth. Bruce Willis has fooled you. As a matter of fact, it is about as funny as cancer, or mass murder. Not to realise that some things are dangerous without having it painfully proven to you is dumb. Hydrogen bombs have never killed anyone. But we can imagine the consequences of a war in which they are used in anger. </p> <p> What can we do, having recognised the danger? All that is advocated at this stage is a surveillance programme aimed at answering one question: is there a major impact due within the next century? Most likely the answer is \"no\". </p> <p>It is like taking out car insurance: you hope you won't need to make a claim. But if the answer is \"yes\" then, with adequate warning, we can take ameliorative action. The only viable method we know to divert an identified impactor involves nuclear weapons, but it is not like in the movies. We are talking here about having 10 or 20 years to get out there and give it a small but sufficient nudge such that it misses our planetary home, and does not deliver its far more powerful punch. </p> <p>The parallel with cancer is a pertinent one. Cancer screening costs relatively little and most often the result is negative. But if a tumour is found, then all the feasible cures are unpleasant, and they may only be used if the cancer is picked up early enough. And you won't find it if you don't look. </p> <p>Ah, but you have never heard of anyone dying due to an asteroid strike? No, there have been no really large impacts during recorded history. Of course not. You wouldn't be here to read about it if there had been. But there was a 15 megaton event over Siberia in 1908 that would have flattened the whole of London if the circumstances had been only slightly different. And Chinese records tell us of a meteorite explosion killing tens of thousands in the 15th century. </p> <p>Statistics can be misleading. Take air crashes. I'm a member of the Qantas frequent flyer club, an airline that has never had an accident. Does that mean that next time I board a Qantas jet to Sydney I have zero risk of dying? Circumstances can change quickly. Until recently Concorde was regarded as a paragon of air safety. Two decades ago virtually everyone, weather forecasters included, thought that hurricanes never hit England. </p> <p>The only nation spending any sensible amount on asteroid defence is the United States. And I do mean \"defence\" - the two most productive search telescopes are owned by the US Air Force. In effect we too, need to declare war on the heavens. </p> <p> Duncan Steel is reader in space technology at the University of Salford. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:D.I.Steel@salford.ac.uk  \">D.I.Steel@salford.ac.uk </a></p>",
  "The vast expenditure and ruthless rank-pulling by the Marquis de Sade's relatives - in trying to destroy traces of his damage among servants, prostitutes, his wife, sister-in-law and anyone else whom he could bully and pinion for his dangerous pleasure - seems still to be paying off. Despite the covering-up, though, there is enough published evidence for Joan Smith (A monster for all the family, G2, September 13) to have avoided adding to the disrespect shown to those, many of them very young and very poor, Sade preyed on. <p>Yes, the most lurid of his ambitions in lust were expressed in his fiction. Even so, Sade used to lament it was only lack of cash that stopped him cutting a much wider swathe through humanity, and buying the impunity that richer criminals of his day were enjoying. </p> <p>Smith refers to Constance Quesnet as the \"devoted companion\" of Sade's last years. Well, as he calculated, she had to stay with him so as to benefit by investments he bought for her every so often. Also, Smith is unfair to Simone de Beauvoir in saying she was fascinated by Sade. Her essay Faut-il bruler Sade? (Must one burn Sade?) is a cool, superb dissection of the fear that kept him from embracing human society and political action. Sade in love? Only with his hollow, quaking self. </p> <p>And the orgy in Rome with Pope Pius VI occurs not in Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom but in his novel Juliette. <br><b>Robert del Quiaro </b><br>London </p> <p>\u0095Daniel Auteuil, who plays the title role in the new film Sade, neither directed nor wrote the film. The director is Benot Jacquot, and the screenplay is by Jacques Fieschi and Bernard Minoret. </p> <p>And there is no way that Luis Bu\u00f1uel's surreal masterpiece L'Age d'Or was based on 120 Days To Sodom, despite a quote from the book and a brief appearance by Sade.

  "<p>Gillian Wearing's art makes Britain look like a place of benign lunacy, a country where there should be a big sign at the ferry terminal that says You Don't Have to Be Mad to Live Here, But it Helps. </p> <p>This maxim is the sort of thing you can imagine on one of the placards people hold in her celebrated photographic work Signs That Say What You Want Them to Say_ (1992-3). These deliberately roughshod pictures greet you in Wearing's retrospective in the Serpentine Gallery's imposing classical space. The sharply coloured photographs collide humorously with the gallery's whiteness. I'm Desperate, says the sign held by a young man in a suit. Southwark Council Hopeless, protests a woman in an alley. </p> <p>This first room of Wearing's solo show brings together the cream of the funny, disarming images that made her name and earned her the Turner prize in 1997. The video Homage to the Woman With the Bandaged Face Who I Saw Yesterday Down Walworth Road (1995) is best of all. Small, intimate and filmed with just the right amount of roughness, it tells how Wearing was so captivated by the sight of a confident, smartly dressed young woman walking down the street with her face entirely bandaged that she re-enacted it, bandaging her own face. Homage... is clever and moving. It points to great things, not just for Wearing but for British film-making: she seems to have hit on a new way of looking at things. You can see why she was so excited, dancing madly to music in her head in the middle of a shopping centre in her video Dancing in Peckham (1994). This collection of Wearing's early works confirms she was one of the real talents to emerge in the British art boom of the last decade. </p> <p>So what went wrong? A retrospective is a cruel thing but, in recent years, Wearing has taken the wrong road. Not just that, but the obviously, predictably wrong one: her work has become more monumental. Her early work brilliantly used the texture of television. Dancing in Peckham is shown on a TV monitor; Homage..., though projected, is also televisual in scale. Wearing has a sculptor's eye for the figure, for framing a body in space, and when this is combined with genuine attention to other people, something magical happens. </p> <p>Nothing happens at all when she tries to be Bruce Nauman, filming a staged love-hate struggle between a mother and daughter. Projected on a colossal scale in the central domed space at the Serpentine, Sacha and Mum (1996) is presented as if it were the centrepiece of the show. But it's too obvious, too analytical. You get the feeling Wearing wants to live down what some might see as the cutesy qualities of her early art. She wants to be thought dark and violent. I don't believe it. What has gone is passion and curiosity. </p> <p>Drunk (1999) is a catastrophe. Projected in black and white across three screens, it depicts a group of street drinkers wandering across a white background. There's a balletic elegance to it all, as Wearing edits the dislocated sequences to the rhythms of drinking life. For a moment I found it poetic and then I felt like an idiot for being taken in by a slick production that says nothing about poverty, homelessness or even being drunk, but instead plays prettily and exploitatively on these things. </p> <p>It's no fun slagging off Wearing. But she needs to get back to what she does best. She does this in her latest piece, Trauma (2000) - though only by repeating an old idea. Like Confess All on Video (1994) at Tate Modern, Trauma invites people to share secrets with the camera, wearing masks and wigs to hide their identity. They talk about childhood incidents that torment them. Some are terrifying, some silly, but you are transfixed. </p> <p>I don't see why Wearing shouldn't keep doing versions of this for the rest of her life. Warhol just carried on filming his Screen Tests and making silkscreen paintings; if an idea works, why not repeat it? The reason, of course, is that careers are supposed to be mapped out as progresses, as development. It's a shame that Wearing, like some of her contemporaries, has become the prisoner of her career. </p> <p>\u0095 Gillian Wearing is at the Serpentine Gallery, London W2 (020-7402 6075), till October 29.</p>",
  "<p>The 60s were not all they are cracked up to be. It was just that things looked different. And the look was invented, as it usually is, by the fashion trade, the print media, by models and those who style and photograph them, but dictated by money and whose pockets the money is in. </p> <p>Mid-20th-century man was either poor or he had a tailor. Model-man was Nigel on the knitting pattern, captured by the potting shed with his teeth clenched, his sartorial splendour dependent on his old mum's willingness to buy wool and have a stab at Fair Isle. His female equivalent, known as the mannequin, was a lady of indeterminate age and equine physicality, a highly cosmeticised parody of the sort of middle-class, middle-aged married woman thought to have the wherewithal to purchase cocktail frocks by the score. </p> <p>As the second half of the century shifted, as it were, its gear, we miraculously became young. The Pill, the proliferation of specialised further education and the erosion of class barriers produced a new generation of wage earners, which meant the young were now a market force. As though by imaginative design, the natural gawkiness of extreme youth replaced Nigel and his lady as an idealistic frame for the display of consumer goods. A new breed of iconographer emerged, superseding the elitist gentleman-portraitists of high-societal aspiration; working-class boys who could see in the darkroom, talked all any'ow, drove flash motors and used their cameras like penis extensions. </p> <p>What they produced was heady, sexy stuff, technically flawless and as limitlessly promising as the midnight chimes of Hogmanay. Glossy magazines became biblical in terms of the compulsion of their imagery and influence. The young believed in what they saw, as though they were looking into a mirror and recognised themselves as both real and invincible. It was no longer inevitable that they would replicate their parents in form or in content. They made the rules. They also made what the media were pleased to call the generation gap. They were on their own. And at the epicentre of their quasi- revolution were three photographers, David Bailey, Brian Duffy and Terence Donovan, a sort of holy trinity of modernity, unchallenged arbiters of all that is true and beautiful.</p> <p>The problem for those who innovate at sub-culture level, who literally make things look different, is that they tend to get impaled on their own cutting edge, enshrined for future decades in the awesome reputation of the cult they subscribed to. If you imply revolution, show that something that seemed to be indelible is washed out and something else has been born, you set a date for yourself and others. The higher you hoist your petard, the more unequivocal its salute, the quicker the imitators move in to date you. That is the nature of sub-culture. Bailey knew this, hung on and survived. Duffy knew it, fancied he heard the muffled march of the philistines coming to trample him and buggered off to pastures new before they came anywhere near. Donovan knew it and railed against it till the day he died. \"These are the 90s?\" he'd roar at anyone remarking upon the celebrity of his youth. \"That was then, this is now.\"</p> <p>It is questionable that he would have much relished the resurgences of his work in exhibitions and coffee-table collections since his death four years ago, all of which somehow serve to increase rather than mute the enigma of his personality. His widow Diana, his colleagues and their friends have collaborated to produce these memorials as though they themselves were looking for a better understanding of the man himself.</p> <p>The morning after his death was announced, with the chilling undertow of its self-infliction, five men counting themselves as members of his most intimate circle telephoned each other in utter consternation. Anyone else, they said one to another, one times five and five times one, anyone else but Donovan. They'd have understood if it'd been a man with observable volatility. Just not Donovan. Not in a thousand years. He was too controlled, too balanced, too centred in his own skin, too philosophical, the very obverse of a suicide. They say so to this day. The more astute of them conclude that, perhaps, he was simply unknowable, that the sweet, equable, funny, generous, diligent, well-mannered Terry they knew merely chose consciously to guard his private self from all-comers. There was nothing they could have done</p> <p>Diana Donovan prefers not to dwell on the circumstances of her husband's death. To this effect she raises a slender white hand, palm outwards, and affirms, in a curiously well-bred version of the Jerry Springer show vernacular, that she will not go there. Suffice it to say that one day she wandered into his studio and found him casually perusing colour transparencies and muttering \"every one a Bruegel\" as he dropped them in the bin, and another day she went there and saw that he was dead. Her devastation is her own affair. </p> <p>She has negotiated her own emotional survival by concentrating on the positive, happy aspects of her marriage and by immersing herself in the task of bringing the enormous diversity of Donovan's contribution to the visual arts to a forgetful public.</p> <p>Her account of their first meeting is succinct and quaintly illuminating. You have to imagine the pair of them. She wasn't a model, but she was pretty and tiny and blonde and very earnestly middle class, thrilled to have landed a job as picture editor for one of the many hopefully seminal glossies that came and went in the mid-60s. He was, well, he was Terence Donovan, the Terence Donovan; built like a brick outhouse, spoiled for choice sex-wise, unreconstructed East End accent, open-top Bentley with white-wall tyres parked outside, Savile Row suit all buttoned up, minions bearing equipment, the full monty. They wouldn't normally have afforded him, but he was a friend of the proprietor and a jolly nice bloke, and besides, they were saving on model fees by using the girls in the office. They combed their hair, did their lipstick and dressed up in raincoats and sou'westers and did what they were told. </p> <p>When the session was over he offered her a lift home. She thought that was rather splendid until they got to Knightsbridge and he said that's it, we're home. As she lived in Earl's Court at the time, she pointed out that it wasn't her home. No, he said, but it is mine. So she thanked him, got out of the car and took a bus the rest of the way. No, he didn't ask her in. No, definitely not. And no, she wasn't remotely offended. All gifted people are eccentric, she reasoned with the impeccable logic of one who would doubtless attribute ego-centricity to the same gesture by a non-gifted person. You had to accept it from such a great photographer. </p> <p>Years later she accepted the rules of their engagement in a similarly deferential manner. No holidays, he said to her. No shopping. Perfectly reasonable, she thought. She is particularly delighted with the episode of the graphologist. While debating with himself whether or not to propose marriage, he sneaked a recipe she'd jotted down in her kitchen and sent it off to a pal of his who interpreted handwriting for the edification of Scotland Yard crime-busters. </p> <p>The resultant report, ill-spelled and typed on a manual typewriter from which the bogeys had not been removed from the \"a\"s and \"e\"s, she continues to treasure as an intuitive and accurate character analysis of herself. It describes a young lady of exceptional taste and refinement, particularly good at colour matching; self-reliant, detached, practical, discreet, loyal and instinctual, an ideal partner for an artistic, enterprising, active man. It is anyone's guess what Donovan made of it; the western equivalent of a gentle geisha, perhaps, but at all events he popped the question, doubts dispelled.</p> <p>He was never nebulous about his expectations of her as a wife. \"Di-di\", he would say to her, it being his special name, \"Di-di, we are all alone in this world. You've got to learn to be alone.\" She didn't understand at first. Having been brought up to imagine that marriage meant an indissoluble togetherness, a belonging with and belonging to, she found it a little daunting to be thrown on her own resources while her husband spent his days in the exclusive company of the world's most beautiful and alluring women. It did not pass her by that her newly acquired husband might easily acquire a new wife. </p> <p>\"You've got to think about things, Di-di,\" he'd say. \"You've got to think things out.\" So she thought about it and concluded there wasn't much point in whining. \"Poor old Terry,\" she'd say, \"stuck in a studio all day with Celia Hammond/Jean Shrimpton/ Cindy Crawford/whoever. Ah well, somebody's got to do it.\"</p> <p>When their first child was imminent, he drove her to Queen Charlotte's Hospital, walked her into reception and drove himself home. There was never any question of him being there. No point in being sad about it, either. It was her business, childbirth. The doctor woke him from a deep sleep to tell him his son had been born. That was just the way he was. Horses for courses, sort of thing. She felt he wanted a family, wanted in some way to replicate the closeness of his childhood family group, with mum and dad downstairs, and Aunt Doll and Uncle Bill and Cousin Roy upstairs. Not that he saw that much of them. He was evacuated by himself to Devon during the war, his father was a long-distance lorry driver and his mum worked full time as a Woolworths floor walker and Cousin Roy was too old to be a companion.</p> <p>So he was very much a loner. He did his very best to train her, as she puts it, in the same mode. And she's grateful now, she really is. It wasn't always easy. Sometimes, she'd fly off the handle about something, get rattled and express anger. \"Hang on,\" he'd, say, \"let's get the right perspective on this. Let's get the whole picture. Let's not pretend it isn't what it is or it is what it isn't.\" And, of course, she'd sometimes feel like giving him a slap, but he was always right, always correctly focused.</p> <p>She never really understood his religious proclivities. Not then, anyway, perhaps a little more since his death. They didn't scrutinise each others' psyches, you see. He was a Zen Buddhist, she was Roman Catholic. These things are private, and besides, he always said there wasn't much difference between the two, apart from the guilt. So far as Diana was aware, he'd been to see The Seven Samurai at about the same time he did his National Service and came out of the cinema with an abiding passion for Japan and all things Japanese. It happened to a lot of people in the 50s. You either fell for La Dolce Vita or, if you were of a more deeply romantic, soulful stamp, Seven Samurai did it for you.</p> <p>Like all morality tales, it is about suffering humanity and what it takes to struggle through this vale of tears with some degree of dignity. The fact that orientals appear to have a different physical centre of gravity from ours, particularly noticeable when they're running about bashing each other with sticks, makes it all seem new and exotic, but the messages are all there, all the good old enduring, universal clich\u00e9s, writ large and bleak in subtitles beneath the seething paddy-fields of another time and another country.</p> <p>There is strength in unity. Selfishness makes you weak. Don't stew in your own juice. A problem shared is a problem halved. If you need help, ask for it. Defence is more difficult than attack. Choose your own battlefield. The enemy is as afraid of you as you are of him; use this against him. Courage is only an attitude you strike. Bravado is better than nothing. Pride goes before a fall. You can't win 'em all. Don't be a willing victim. Kill or be killed. Go down fighting. The next world is a very nice place; there are no bandits there.</p> <p>In effect it is the philosophy of the judo mat. And Donovan was a black belt. The tenets of Zen are so amorphous, as much about what they're not as what they are, you are in danger of ballsing up any attempt to verbalise them. The original Buddha, bless him, never wrote anything down, he just sat there minding his own business until he was good and ready to go public with whatever part of his tangled web he was weaving. This probably accounts for the plethora of bastardised versions that prevailed in the 60s, vapid souls who imagined their personal path to enlightenment lay in expanding their self-consciousness, babbling about their innermost f-f-f-feelings and being bloody rude to everyone with their home truths.</p> <p>What was so difficult to assimilate was the yin and yang of it, the balance: the pesky fact that we are all huge bundles of contradictions, polarised monsters whose backs are always exactly and invariably as broad as our fronts.</p> <p>Top and bottom, though, it means we're supposed to try to be good. According to Diana, this was Donovan's avowed intent. He just wanted to be a good man, to help and not hinder his fellows. He would also argue ad nauseam with himself and with anyone who'd listen about the meaning of good. \"He could,\" Diana said with something akin to maternal pride, \"tie you in knots.\"</p> <p>Donovan was never ostentatious about his Buddhism. So far as Diana ever knew in their 28 years together, he didn't meditate so you'd notice, nor did he light incense sticks and make a song and dance at an altar, chanting and what have you. Every evening, though, he went to the Budakwai to practise his judo and just be in a safe place, nobody asking him to account for himself, a man among other men trying to up the grade of their judo belts, trying, literally, to better themselves. White belt, yellow belt, green belt, brown belt, black belt; all very Mickey-Mouse on the face of it, but it took hard work and dedication. </p> <p>The hierarchic structure of his chosen discipline made sense to him so there is no paradox in the fact he was politically Conservative. He adored Margaret Thatcher. His portrait of her owes something to Annigoni's highly romanticised painting of the young Queen Elizabeth; noble, heroic, yawningly portentous. He enjoyed her company and, unsurprisingly, she enjoyed his. He had all her party political broadcasts with no hint of cynicism. They got on together like a house on fire; the grocer's daughter and the lorry driver's son, escapees of obscurity, subscribers to the principle of \"If I can do it so can you and if you can't you have only yourself to blame.\"</p> <p>Donovan's value system was founded, like Thatcher's, on the Protestant work ethic, which is all the more potent for being tacit. Work hard, and you get rewarded; idle, and you don't. Pure pragmatism. Donovan had no patience with lazy students in his teaching days. Right, he'd say, anybody not feel like buckling down, sod off out of it. As the 70s and 80s dripped by and his profession was over-run with would-be Donovans, his scorn was boundless. Look at them, he'd say, running off 90 rolls of film in the hope that one of them will have a picture on it. Not one of them has seen the inside of a darkroom and most of the buggers don't know how to load a fucking camera. And he was right.</p> <p>There is nothing morally wrong with having the Midas touch in Zen ideology. In a way you're duty bound to make as much loot as you can so that you can redistribute it where it's needed. Terry would empty his pockets for anyone down on their luck, Diana says. He never passed a beggar on the street . . . Donovan made a great deal of money. His business ventures always came good and a quarter of a century spent making commercials for film and television made him a rich man by anybody's standards. His money wedge, he called it - as in \"You all right for wedge?\" - also defended him against disparagement.</p> <p>Once, while mooching around the National Portrait Gallery, he was greeted by an upper-class aesthete of his acquaintance. \"Why Terence,\" said the man, \"fancy seeing you here! I didn't know you were interested in this sort of thing.\" </p> <p>\"I'm not,\" Donovan replied, whipping out a hefty wedge. \"These are all the portraits I'm interested in.\" </p> <p>A lot of loyal friends felt that Donovan compromised his artistic integrity with so much commercial work. He always insisted he was a craftsman, not an artist. Perhaps he longed to be contradicted. His advertisements were technically brilliant, of course, they had the requisite style and punch, but they could always only be a triumph of form over content. And even a craftsman wants to say something louder than Wear Tuff Boots or Drink Guinness. His foray into feature film making was singularly unsuccessful. He made a movie about a Japanese spy in London. I haven't seen it. Very few people have. Those who had the privilege variously opine \"He was having a joke\", \"It was fantastically interesting\" and \"Crap\". Donovan had no option but to shrug it off. \"I believed in it,\" was all he ever said. He did not invite sympathy, nor did he get much. </p> <p>It is considered axiomatic that a man who gives the impression of being completely in control of himself is somehow immune to the anguish of disappointment. Particularly if he has a sense of humour. There was an unseemly hoo-ha, for instance, over his Robert Palmer promo. For this effort he gathered together a tribe of his favourite models, the thin but bosomy types who precursed the supermodel, dolled them up in next to nothing and had them zombying about like a bunch of identical, porny automatons. By way, I imagine, of ironic comment upon the socio-sexual mores of the pop scene. How would I know? At all events, those more deeply entrenched thereabouts than I took a certain umbrage. Surely this was insulting to women? Not only were they showing their bits, they were clearly inept musically since they weren't really playing their guitars. It was rather as though Donovan had taken it upon himself wilfully to pimp the wretched promo. Then the supreme irony came as various seedy entrepreneurial hopefuls began their moves to book the backing group, which was nothing if not unconsciously Zen of them.</p> <p>When Donovan decided to return to still photography, he found that art editors, like policemen, had become absurdly young. \"They've never heard of me,\" he confided to his peers. \"Or the Beatles. What a load of wankers.\" But he had been right all along. These really were the 90s. During their course he privately - intensely privately - took himself back to the drawing board and embarked on the process of becoming what he always said he wasn't, an artist. As though laughing at himself before anyone could get a snigger, he was overtly shy and wry about it, but obsessive, earnest, perfectionist. They're all in storage now, packed away in a warehouse somewhere with their faces to the wall, evidence of years spent trying to nail his concept of Japanese art to his own flag-pole.</p> <p>Perhaps he had chosen, at the unpromising hour of mid-life crisis, to take himself back to the original passion of the lonely, teen-aged boy who wanted to be a Samurai warrior, to focus finally on the place inside himself he liked the best and cut out the middleman of technology. Diana Donovan remembers the day he sold a painting. It hadn't been for sale, none of them was, but an acquaintance saw it, liked it, wanted it and a deal was struck. It's a funny thing, Diana said, but she had never seen him so thrilled to have earned money in his life.</p> <p>In 1996, the year of his death, he was working for the glossies again, bad-mouthing picture-desk wankers and generally doing what came naturally. In his spare time he keyed in his word processor to capital letters and began to write. He planned a series of vignettes, apparently, to expose his thought processes to a wider public and have a bit of a laugh. In one of them, which he has archly entitled The Curious Power Of Yellow, he rails against the complacency with which the British have allowed their beautiful cities to be fouled up by madmen who rush about scribbling ugly yellow lines on our lovely streets. What has happened to our British fighting spirit? Are we fit only to be footie-drunks? Why aren't we ashamed not to be more like the French, who boldly put a stop to vehicle clamping by the simple expedient of roughing up the clampers in the first week of their incarnation and throwing their stupid gadgets into the Seine? </p> <p>Another heart-cry centres upon the freedom and ease with which middle-class Englishmen abuse women. The abuse he pinpoints is the mindless, aggressive \"joshing\" manner with which certain \"pink-faced twits\" who are not \"secure in their souls\" make derogatory personal remarks to pretty girls who don't know how to defend themselves. Then, with Samurai precision, he outlines the remedy for this offence of offences. What you do, he wrote (in capital letters), is this . . . Place the left hand firmly on the back of the abuser's neck. With the finger and thumb of the right hand firmly grip the windpipe. And pinch.</p> <p>The abuse, he concludes with the penchant for overstatement possessed of all keen amateurs, \"WILL STOP WITH A SLIGHT GURGLE AND NEVER OCCUR AGAIN\".</p>",

  "<p>In a small house in Los Angeles, an archaeological project is taking place - one that digs deep into the \"low end of American art\". For 25 years, artist Jim Shaw has built up an eclectic collection of American junk, including his unwieldy chef-d'oeuvre - a revered collection of thrift-store paintings by anonymous amateurs bought from American flea markets, secondhand stores and charity shops. </p> <p>Shaw is a laconic figure, deadpan even. As a serious diviner of popular culture, he would never be seen to laugh at these paintings, as might some spotty student ironist. \"For instance, I saw a book called something like Black Velvet Paintings: Those You Love To Hate,\" he says. \"I wouldn't dream of being that disrespectful to the thrift-store paintings.\" Instead, Shaw's eye finds oddball value in such items, alerting one to how the abandoned, tatty and kitsch can be amusing, but also strange, disturbing and possibly even mind-expanding. </p> <p>The 400-odd paintings have been rescued by Shaw from dusty obscurity. Now his collection is famous in the art world - an unlikely outcome for the work of these ingenue artists, who didn't have a clue they would one day be splashed over the world's art galleries. A few years ago Charles Saatchi wanted to buy the lot, but Shaw didn't then want to sell, feeling that it should be in an American museum, but now says that he is prepared to let the collection go. </p> <p>Shaw grew up in a small chemical-producing town called Midland, in Michigan, and as an adolescent was already exploring the decor detritus of middle America, going into the lucky dips that were the town's thrift stores. \"Back then, we could find stuff going back to the turn of the century,\" he says. \"Nowadays you'd be hard pressed to find things from before the 70s.\" Indeed: as any charity-shop hound this side of the Atlantic will attest, junk is getting poorer in quality. </p> <p>As a result of this rich early experience, Shaw's eye was weaned on the popular Americana of the period. \"When I was a kid, I was an avid collector of comic books. My parents were sick of it - they forbade me to have monster magazines. They didn't like the more lurid type of comic.\" But Shaw became mesmerised by the reject undergrowth of America's golden consumer age. He has called the thrift-store art project \"anthropology\" - insofar as it involves \"looking through the garbage of American culture\", and has become a kind of historian of the trash vernacular. </p> <p>As an artist, Shaw has drawn on this kind of material. His My Mirage took elements from pulp novels, posters, comics, records, and toy soldiers to create what the Los Angeles Times called \"a complete upchucking of the first 20 years of the life of a middle-class American boy born in the 50s\". Several of these things remain in his home, including phalanxes of toy soldiers on a mantlepiece, odd dolls and masks, and, in the kitchen, \"tiki\" exotica such as souvenir Easter Island heads. A vinyl-covered Salvation Army-salvaged piano is in the living room. \"It cost more to get it tuned than to buy it,\" he says. </p> <p>For a long time, Shaw was driven to collect \"anything strange\", particularly ceramics. But there eventually came a point at which he had to stop buying bulkier items and limit himself to two-dimensional objects such as books, records, paintings - partly due to space, partly because the tat had started to move into a secondary, collectors market. This is when he decided to build up his thrift-store painting collection. Exotic records by artists such as Esquival and Les Baxter were becoming hip among the lounge set. \"Then I realised that these paintings were unquantifiable. They were pretty strange, and no one else wanted them.\" </p> <p>He honed his aesthetic at CalArts - the same art school that produced angsty comic-strip artist Raymond Pettibone and sculptor Mike Kelley, best known for his scary use of secondhand stuffed animals, and long celebrated in the UK's art schools. With Kelley, Shaw had a band called Destroy All Monsters. </p> <p>After art school, he \"forgot to leave LA\", and has been here since 1976, ending up in the district of Highland Park since 1993, living in what is termed a \"craftsman\" house, built in the 1920s. \"For some reason, you see them a lot in the X-Files. It has lots of wood and built-in cupboards.\"</p> <p>These shelves and niches are ideal for the display of his weird knick-knacks, but there is only room for a fraction of his 400-strong painting collection on the walls of the house, and besides, it is not everyone's idea of everyday viewing: his wife, the artist Marnie Weber, has raised objections to living with daubs of spooky clowns and grinning cheerleaders. There are, however, still quite a few paintings in the house, crammed into recesses in the bathroom or wherever else they can fit. Some go back years. Headless Beat Girl With Paintbrushes Sticking From Head came from a thrift store in Eagle Rock, LA. The Nymphs, has had a place above the mantlepiece for seven years. </p> <p>Shaw gives his paintings very literal titles. Nude, Deer Head, Many Women And Dotted Line is typical; Man With No Crotch Sits Down With Girl is another, while Off-road Helmet Merges With Landscape stretched his descriptive ingenuity. The paintings are divided into arch sub-genres - Teenage Fantasies, Psycho Paintings, Beefcakes And Cheesecakes - into which they fit fairly neatly. Of course, these devices only serve to emphasise their strangeness. But while it taxes his curatorial skills, Shaw insists that the thrift-store painting project is not about finding unsung talent. \"That's a bit like the old question, 'Could Bing Crosby have sung opera?'\" he says. \"I don't know. Is it relevant?\" </p> <p>Crucially, Shaw makes few claims for the thrift-store artists. These are not marginal visionaries like the so-called \"Outsider\" artists; nor are they necessarily Sunday painters - the derogatory term used since the 19th century for dilettante amateurs. Yet the ones that he has chosen - and he has \"tended to be a little bit selective\" - hit a bizarre discord in the soul, and Shaw himself sees all kinds of societal tendencies in them. \"A lot of the more surrealist and expressionist paintings among them involve some sort of sinful activity,\" he says. \"There seems to be a lot of puritanism, shame and guilt involved.\" </p> <p>Shaw's project has artistic lineage. The search for the unschooled, the naive and raw in art has a pedigree throughout modernism, from Picasso marvelling at tribal masks to Jean Dubuffet's post-war search for \"Art Brut\"; literally \"raw art\", produced by the unschooled and marginal. Indeed, the elusive intellectual quest for authentic creativity can even be seen in the shaky needlework of Tracey Emin, and the work of certain American painters such as John Curran and Alex Katz, which look a bit \"thrift store\" in execution. In this context, Shaw's artists may be seen as genuine suburban primitives. </p> <p>Equally, such junk-shop finds form a part of the history of objets trouv\u00e9s and ready-mades - works found complete, and invested with status by the professional artist-discoverer. Upending this notion is a section in the archive labelled \"Inspired By Modern Art\". </p> <p>\"Dal\u00ed, Magritte and Van Gogh tend to be the biggest inspirations,\" he says. \"It's that adolescent thing of loving surrealism and expressionism.\" </p> <p>Few of the thrift-store artists have been in contact with Shaw, although one did phone him, having seen his work in Shaw's book, Thrift Store Painting. On one occasion, when the show was in Hawaii, someone recognised a painting she'd given to her sister in law, and which had ended up abandoned. \"I gave her the painting back,\" says Shaw. \"It turned out that her husband had told her to give up art.\" This tale of crushed creativity moved him, and he tried to encourage her to do more. </p> <p>It looks as if Shaw has started something big. There are now several thrift-store painting-type sites on the internet - galleries include Huge Gallery, PSB Gallery, Friendly Toast and the Museum Of Bad Art. And now there are British collectors, including Tim Burke, who is having a show of his own more modest collection of Brit-thrift paintings at Coins, a west London coffee house, which includes paintings of Princess Diana, Spitfires and pub interiors. \"They were abandoned,\" says Burke, \"like orphans that needed a new parent.\" </p> <p>With all this interest in modern folk art, the buyers may well amass to purchase Jim Shaw's historic slice of the American cultural underbelly. But even if they do, Shaw's work is not over. Like a frontiersman of taste, he is driven to \"keep collecting weird things\" </p> <p>\u0095 Jim Shaw's Thrift Store Paintings can be seen at the ICA, The Mall, London SW1 from September 28 to November 5.

  "<p>When he was 12 or 13, sometime around 1972, Matthew Bourne started taking the bus two or three evenings a week from his home in workaday Walthamstow into London's theatreland. There was a hint of the magic to come as the 38 rumbled past Sadler's Wells in Islington. But not till it reached Shaftesbury Avenue where, as dusk faded into night and showbiz names blinked in yellow lights, was the spell fully cast. </p> <p>In school blazers, Bourne and his friend, Simon Carter - both obsessive autograph hunters - would arrive at the stage door of the Apollo, Lyric, Palace or Queens theatres to waylay actors on their way in.\"We were very polite to everyone,\" Bourne recalls. \"It was always sir and miss. We were never rude or familiar, so we got a lot of names.\" Gradually, the boys were accepted by the clique of adults who habitually hung round theatres and hotels in the hope of getting the signatures of the famous. \"They were all misfits, and I'd be embarrassed to say I was doing it now,\" says Bourne. </p> <p>To find out where the stars were staying, they clubbed together for a subscription to a celebrity bulletin, which was posted to the self-important doyenne of the group. \"You used to ring her up twice a week to get the names. She'd just read out the list - 'Elizabeth Taylor, Dorchester, two nights; Gloria Swanson, Connaught, three nights'. She never even said hello or goodbye; she was totally charmless.\" Even so, she was the link with the twilight world of posh hotels and first nights where stage and screen stars became real people in coats and hats. </p> <p>Fast forward almost 30 years. A few weeks ago, around six pm - the hour when he used to haunt stage doors - Bourne was sitting alone in the stalls of the Old Vic, snacking from a plastic tray; afternoon rehearsals over; evening session to come. Between its try-out in the provinces and the London opening, Bourne was fine-tuning his latest show. Devised by him and performed by the company he created, Adventures in Motion Pictures, it opened this week at the Old Vic. In 2002 the theatre will become AMP's permanent home. The fan has come in from the cold. </p> <p>The former schoolboy whose good manners charmed the big names of showbiz has shaken the canon of classic ballet and shocked some traditionalists. He's not the bad boy of British dance - that's still Michael Clark with his dildos and bare bottoms. But, given there's always an erotic charge in ballet, Bourne has stepped up the voltage, famously recasting Swan Lane as a piece mainly for blokes, and presenting a sexually dysfunctional household in Cinderella, which he set in the London Blitz. </p> <p>Now he has turned Carmen into a ballet about a male drifter, a bisexual who bowls into a small US township like a hormonal hurricane. Bourne has relocated the workplace from cigarette factory to garage, and flagrantly flagged up the liberties he's taken with a tongue-in-cheeky title:from Carmen to Car Man. No wonder some pillars of the dance world have had palpitations. But plaudits from audiences and most critics attest to Bourne's success in bringing closer the once-separate realms of classical and contemporary dance and dance theatre. In commercial terms, AMP has leapt from the fringe to the big stage. Swan Lake clocked up 120 performances after its West End transfer in 1996 - the longest run for a full-length dance classic. It has garnered international awards and played to packed houses on Broadway </p> <p>But if Swan Lake was the work which put him in the international spotlight, another fairy tale might serve as a metaphor for his early life: the Ugly Duckling. \"I had black hair when I was born and a big red spot on my nose,\" he says. \"The nurses used to make fun of me because I was ugly, which upset my mother.\" That blotch soon disappeared and Bourne grew up into a kid smiling readily enough for the family album; in some photos, though, there's a hint that he'd sooner be playing his own game than joining in anyone else's. </p> <p>At the mixed comprehensive he attended - Sir George Monoux (now a sixth-form college): the teachers offered no encouragement for the artistic projects Bourne liked. It was a rough place, with the girls tougher than the boys. \"I absolutely hated it; was terrified of it; never learned anything. I was slightly bullied, not terribly, but I certainly wasn't the 'in' person.\" His mother remembers he told her once that he'd learned not to look anybody in the eye. </p> <p>At home his hobby was putting on amateur shows, dreamed up from movies he'd seen with his parents, both big film fans. He roped in his mother to sew costumes, father to make the sets, and his brother to act and sing. Matthew had developed a passion for music and dance from his fifth birthday, when he was taken to see The Sound Of Music; he's been a fan of the show ever since. Later his mother passed on her own Cockney girlhood habit of going \"up West\" and queuing for a seat in the gods. He didn't tell anyone at school about his autograph hunting, or about the amateur shows. </p> <p>His parents, June and Jim, had lost their first baby, and doted on their two surviving sons. They always thought Matthew would end up on the stage, but they were not pushy. Jim was with Thames Water for 30 years, working his way up to be a supply controller; June was a secretary. They still live in the rented house on a small 1930s private estate where the boys grew up; it almost passes for rustic compared with its high-rise neighbours. They had the chance to buy the house years ago, but their sons' needs came first. \"We tried to give them everything they wanted,\" says Jim. \"Dan [the younger] was sporty like us, and we used to spend our money on a bit of coaching for him. Matthew had to have his theatre tickets and a bit of money so he could buy records.\" </p> <p>The Bournes' Walthamstow house is now a shrine to the boys, Matt especially: posters, photographs with celebrities like Cameron Macintosh and Shirley MacLaine. And the family still has a behind-the-scenes supporting role in Matthew's shows. June and Jim adore attending first nights in London or Los Angeles. \"My mum was always a bit stylish, but now she's more so,\" says Bourne; June says she still casts an eye on the costumes (now made professionally, where she once used to run them up) and organises the AMP fans' magazine. </p> <p>As well as their day jobs, Jim and June did evening youth work for more than 20 years. The clubs they ran became a bit rougher as the neighbourhood changed, so they sent their sons off to one run by the Methodists. It had a choir and a drama group: Matthew was in his element, and was soon staging potted versions of musicals. </p> <p>At school, though, Bourne served his time, increasingly bored until he left with two A-levels (grade Cs) and no clear idea about a career. As a sixth-former, he says his teacher pretty well put him off Shakespeare for ever. For A-level exams, he read Brodie's Notes instead of the set books. </p> <p>Frustration set in quickly when he started work, first as a clerk in the BBC contracts department. His vague idea was that it might lead to something creative. It didn't. Next, the Keith Prowse ticket agency (\"very boring, but I got to see a lot of free shows\"), then he worked in the National Theatre bookshop. He might be there still if he hadn't also been an usher, and found the others weren't just theatre devotees as he was: they were drama and dance students. </p> <p>He had been increasingly led to the world of dance since he bought a ticket out of curiosity to see Swan Lake at Covent Garden. \"I must have liked it because I saw another production two weeks later at Sadler's Wells. It wasn't like I expected. They moved a lot quicker; I thought the steps were quite interesting. But I didn't come away thinking 'It's all so beautiful'. I thought it was quite odd and unusual. But I loved the glamorous central figures.\" Soon biographies of Diaghilev and Nijinsky joined movies by Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock in the personal eclectic encyclopedia of cultural references, high and low, that was to be so useful in the future. </p> <p>He made the leap in 1983, to a degree course at the Laban Centre for Movement and Dance in south London. Finding his m\u00e9tier took so long because, he says, \"I was directionless and na\u00efve about the whole thing, and my parents were too, because it was so obvious what I was into - putting on a show.\" None of his immediate family had gone to university, and no-one had suggested dance or drama school to him. </p> <p>He set up Adventures in Motion Pictures with friends from Laban. The early days of the company comprised \"gigs at \u00a330 and long drives back to London after shows, because we couldn't afford to stay overnight,\" says founder member Emma Gladstone. There were lots of experimental contemporary dance around when AMP started up. Groups such as the Cholmondeleys and the Featherstonehaughs are still stepping out, but AMP is unusual, if not unique, in making a commercial crossover. </p> <p> There's been sniping from some in the contemporary camp that Bourne's company has sold out. Gladstone though, now assistant director of The Place theatre, believes this criticism is misplaced. \"Matt's had huge commercial potential from the beginning. He makes dance that's accessible and well-crafted\". And he has paid his dues: \"He didn't get any real recognition for 10 years.\" </p> <p>After producing a dozen or so small works, the break came when Bourne was asked to choreograph the Nutcracker for Opera North in 1992. His wit, mischief and originality were set loose on a classic. Katherine Dor\u00e9, who joined AMP as administrator in 1989 and is now its business brain, says, \"Nutcracker was a big learning curve for us. I said to Matt we either take the next step without being under the umbrella of Opera North and the Arts Council or we go back to being six dancers in a mini-van.\" </p> <p>They decided to bet on the bigtime, though they haven't made a mint - yet, though people assume they must have coined it with Swan Lake. Dor\u00e9, who also produces the company's work, has brought in more financial discipline, and says: \"In the end, the sums probably come out at zero, but the perception is that we've made an absolute fortune because of its high profile.\" </p> <p>When AMP was an infant, Bourne was happy enough to muck in, licking envelopes and writing press releases. Now that he's free of those responsibilities he's relieved. \"I don't really enjoy the business side of it. As long as I've got artistic control, I'm OK, but I wouldn't know where to begin to raise money.\" The one big profitable project he's had to date was nothing to do with AMP. Cameron Mackintosh asked him to do much of the choreography for the 1995 revival of Oliver!, and the fees for this paid for the house in Islington where he lives with his partner, Arthur Pita, a principle dancer with AMP. </p> <p>Bourne is now 40; he has the same build as Kenneth Branagh, but looks more unassuming. Watching him at a late rehearsal for Car Man, outsiders wouldn't take him for a former dancer. The waist has filled out a bit; he moves economically, almost stiffly; he's generally easy-going and affable. But as a dozen young dancers go through their sexual aerobics for a scene in act one, outside Dino's Diner, he hovers anxiously as if watching a workman fix the plumbing. He's made his mark as a choreographer, though it's a word he's still shy of using. Too pompous, he says. \"I call what I do shows; I don't call them ballets.\" Fred Astaire was as much an influence as Frederick Ashton. </p> <p>Just as well, as far as Clement Crisp, dance critic of the Financial Times, is concerned: \"I don't think of him at all seriously as a choreographer; he's an astute producer.\" Crisp, a critic for 45 years, is quite fed up with Bourne's way of \"turning some of ballet's older masterpieces upside down and shaking them to see what falls out of their pockets.\" Although he maintains that Bourne \"polishes off his scores with the sensitivity of Sweeney Todd\", and that his dance numbers are \"laboured rather than felicitous\", Crisp nonetheless allows that AMP has some virtues. It has enlarged the audience for dance, and the public loves it; however its productions are nothing to do with ballet, says Crisp wearily. </p> <p>The opposite, upbeat view comes from the New Yorker's dance writer, Joan Acocella, who mentions Bourne in the same breath as Frederick Ashton (\"England's master of classicism, of dance as dance\") and Kenneth MacMillan (\"the story man, the dance dramatist\"), who dominated the British scene for decades. Since their deaths, there had been no worthy successor to carry either strand forward, argues Acocella. Seeing Cinderella in Los Angeles, she confirmed her opinion that \"now, at last, in Bourne we have someone really interesting, large-minded - also young and wild - and he is an inheritor of MacMillan.\" </p> <p>Laurels indeed, but Bourne himself is too canny to flaunt them before the Covent Garden cognoscenti. He wooed Royal Ballet's Adam Cooper and Sarah Wildor to appear in Swan Lake and Cinderella, but he's not of the classical tribe. He accepts their tributes but can't resist cocking a camp snook. When a diva or a dowager inquires, \"When were you at the [RB] school?\" he replies with faux innocence, \"What school would that be?\" </p> <p>Bourne's reputation is for crossing more cultural boundaries than Sam Mendes. He's doing the dance numbers for a revival of the musical My Fair Lady at the National Theatre, where he hopes Trevor Nunn will let him direct Pal Joey in 2002; Disney has asked AMP to work on a version of the Little Mermaid; and he's in discussions to do a stage dance/musical version of Edward Scissorhands, a gothic story of an outsider at large in the stifling suburbs, which may have some personal resonance for an ex-Walthamstow boy.. </p> <p>For all his closeness to his family, there was one secret Bourne didn't reveal for a long time: his sexuality. He didn't hide it, but it wasn't something the family talked about. Bourne didn't admit to himself that he was gay till he was 18. It seems to have been a relatively tranquil rite of passage. Tom Robinson's single, Glad To Be Gay was a pop anthem in 1978. On the sleeve was the Gay Switchboard phone number. He rang it and was referred to an address in grimy Holloway. Expecting to see a councillor surrounded by depressed teenagers, his heart jumped when he found himself in a gay youthclub. He was flattered to be pounced on \"till I realised it happened all the time when new blood arrived\". </p> <p>His qualification reveals modesty but, even more, evidence of Bourne's self-steadying, self-preserving mechanism. He makes no bones about being gay but, says Judith Mackrell, the Guardian's dance editor, it would be anathema to him to be labelled as a gay choreographer because that would be too limiting. Dancers closest to him know that he doesn't fully open up to anyone, except his partner, Pita. </p> <p> Bourne's coming out stretched over the last carefree years in the early 80s before Aids scythed its path. He discoed to Donna Summer and the Bee Gees and came home late, remaining silent when faced with a questioning Mum. June Bourne says, \"I had a feeling he might have been gay by the time he was four, but I don't think Jim knew, because we never discussed it.\" They both seem quite tickled that Matthew publicly announced the fact in an aside on the South Bank Show. Bourne was never uneasy about his sexuality, he says. \"When I first kissed a guy, it felt the most natural thing in the world to me. But the odd thing was that, up to the point when it happened, though I was attracted by images of [male] pop stars, I'd never really imagined myself with a man - or with anyone.\" </p> <p>He has stayed in long-term relationships: with Arthur Pita for five years - they became an item some time after Pita (who been in Cinderella and Swan Lake and is in Car Man) joined AMP; and for seven years before that with David Manners, who designed for the company. \"My friend Simon [Carter] says I've always gone from one relationship to another - I've always got the next one lined up.\" Bourne jokes about his constancy, but he admits, \"I suppose I was always looking for someone to be with. I wasn't sexually led, particularly. If I was with someone, that was it.\" </p> <p>The dance world isn't synonymous with gay culture, though they overlap. The forays Bourne made to the West End as a teenager - \"it was my playground\" - had a dual purpose: social and sexual; entertainment and cultural. In dance, they overlapped. \"There's always been a sort of allure of eroticism in dance; that appealed to me. I do get infatuated with certain dancers I work with - in a way you have to, to want to make roles for them. I did with Adam Cooper [who's heterosexual]. But it's the same with a female dancer for me as well - you have to pour a lot into them to get something back.\" </p> <p>But sometimes a relationship isn't possible; and sometimes ideas have to be redrafted. There's a wonderful inventiveness which is all his own, for instance, giving Cinderella a Norma Desmond of a stepmother, adding two weirdos as stepbrothers, and making the fairy godmother a (male) guardian angel. His idea for setting it in the Blitz was partly based on his relatives' experience in the war, but his research revealed that Prokofiev composed the ballet in the 1940s, further justification for recreating the ballet as a wartime piece. </p> <p>In Swan Lake, however, his original idea for two black male dancers to take the leads didn't come off - the dancers he wanted thought it stupid. There was another disappointment with his new work. Though he wrote the Car Man with Adam Cooper in mind, Cooper declined, possibly because, having left the Royal Ballet, he wants to earn bigger fees than AMP can pay. In future, Bourne says AMP won't have guest stars; it will be an ensemble (which is how it started), presenting its repertory several months a year at the Old Vic, and touring. </p> <p>While fresh ideas are his forte, he's glad of the input of dancers when it comes to the choreography. Katharine Dor\u00e9 says, \"I see Matt as the grand editor, in as much as the dancers create movements and characters. Matt will give them the name and the essence of a character. They go away and create the role, then he brings it all together, taking the bits that work and discarding the others. That's his genius.\" Scott Ambler, an associate director who has been with the company since 1991, confirms this: \"As for coming up with the steps, I think Matt finds this the least interesting. He likes the ideas, then the dancers will shape them into dance material, then he can work with it.\" </p> <p>All choreography is a joint effort, Judith Mackrell points out, and much as she admires Bourne, she doesn't put him in the first rank. She notes, for example, that he has come up with more interesting steps for male than for female dancers. </p> <p>While the older generation of classical dancers pays Bourne rather prim and proper compliments - Dame Beryl Grey says he's a great talent who has done much to popularise ballet - younger stars are more openly enthusiastic. The Royal Ballet's Deborah Bull says, \"Matthew is a fantastic producer. He has a wonderful eye and a wonderful way of giving new life to traditional work.\" That's particularly valuable, she believes, because, unlike other art forms, ballet currently lacks great producers. </p> <p>As bigger projects came, Bourne's approach had to be modified. AMP started \"as a bunch of mates\", Ambler explains. \"Because they were all students, they all had the same dance language, so it could be much more cooperative. Matt was quite happy to go into the group and say, 'I'm choreographing this piece' because he knew what styles they knew.\" </p> <p>When Swan Lake reached the West End, there had to be eight performances a week for the production to pay its way. That meant a total of 45 dancers split into three casts. With a bigger intake of performers with different backgrounds, Bourne had to get used to working with new people instead of the core he was used to. Ambler says he soon realised that new people could offer things he didn't know - \"he's interested in ballet, jazz dance, modern - he really enjoys that kind of melting pot, and the input of different dancers.\" </p> <p>But that flexibility wasn't always there. Dor\u00e9 recalls that in 1990, after AMP had got Equity cards for dancers, some obviously moved on. But Bourne had been so attuned to working with them \"he was sitting with his head in his hands saying 'it's finished'.\" </p> <p>A small detail, says Dor\u00e9 but it reveals Bourne's needs to protect himself: \"He always looks on the pessimistic side.\" They both realise now, she says, that they won't go on for ever with AMP. There will be growth, and an expanded repertory that can be revived and toured. Eventually AMP may end, but there is optimism as other projects come along. Hollywood, among many other suitors, is beckoning. Bourne says ,\"I see myself stopping when I'm really happy with what I've done. I've no ambition to have the work carried on and on, but I do like the fact that I'm in the history books of dance.\" His Swan Lake gets a mention in the new Macmillan encyclopedia of dance. \"That pleases me more than anything,\" he says. </p> <p>It is, after all, a more permanent tribute to the work of any artist than the transient attention of fans. Bourne was reminded of that a few weeks ago when, outside a theatre, he spotted, from long ago, the queen of the autograph hunters he used to hang round with. \"She didn't recognise me.\" Of course.</p>",

  "As Tony Blair returned nine days ago from the UN special assembly in New York, he confided that the French president, Jacques Chirac, had assured him his government would not crumble in the face of protests by its lorry drivers. The revolt against petrol duty would not spread across Europe. <p>As Blair was speaking, a small group of self-described nobodies were driving slowly through the darkness towards the Shell Stanlow refinery at Ellesmere Port and a date with a history. The convoy had been born out of a meeting convened by Brynle Williams, a loquacious sheep and beef farmer from Cilcain, north Wales. </p> <p>The meeting, at Ruthin cattle market the previous Monday, had been addressed by politicians including Peter Rogers, a Conservative member of the Welsh assembly. Mr Rogers became a farming hero after he addressed farmers picketing Irish lorries at Holyhead in November 1997 in a protest that spawned the militant farmers' movement. </p> <p>The meeting was chaotic, Mr Rogers recalls, but at the end Mr Williams went into a huddle with a group of hauliers. They came up with a plot to blockade fuel supplies at depots starting at the weekend. </p> <p>The next day BP and Texaco raised the price of petrol in response to the rise in crude oil. By Wednesday the mood had turned so angry that Mr Williams called another meeting at the St Asaph livestock auction market for the following night. </p> <p>More than 150 farmers and hauliers met in the sales ring to toss ideas around. The French protesters had inspired them with their direct action. One of those at the meeting, Clive Swan, urged that they strike that night. He recalls saying: \"If we don't go now when we are motivated we'll will wake up tomorrow morning, saying, 'It's Aunt Betty's wedding on Sunday and I cannot go.' There were some people who were nervous. They thought they might get hoovered up by the police.\" </p> <p>Mr Williams took a vote and the majority was for a blockade of the refinery. Everyone piled into their cars and borrowed tractors and headed straight for the Stanlow refinery. It was an inspired target. The plant has a fleet of 60 tankers owned by P&amp;O Shipping and private hauliers. It distributes 1.8m tons of fuel a day to keep the north-west on the move. </p> <p>\"We thought we would stay the night, make our point, go on the morning news and go home,\" Mr Swan recalls. </p> <p>For six hours the men kept up a real blockade of tractors and lorries across the entrance. Management, desperate that their inflammable plant might become a safety risk if the mood turned ugly, called in the local Labour MP, Andrew Miller, who tried to persuade the group to move, but they refused to budge until the police marched on them. Once that happened at 4.30am, the exit routes were cleared. </p> <p>But by then, the great leaderless revolt had been sparked. The coalition of Farmers for Action and militant lorry owners had been spawned. Farmers and hauliers the next day moved on the Texaco and Elf sites in Pembrokeshire. Motorway go-slows spread. </p> <p><b> Vulnerable</b><br> </p> <p> No one in Whitehall had foreseen the scale of the protest, nor the speed with which the fourth largest economy in the world could be laid low by no more than 2,000 pickets. Ministers knew they were vulnerable on petrol and diesel prices due to the fuel duty escalator. </p> <p>The escalator may have been introduced by the Tories in 1993 to ensure motorists bore the full cost of driving, including the environmental cost, but the chancellor, Gordon Brown, increased its rate from 5% to 6% in 1997, a rate continued in the budgets of 1998 and 1999. </p> <p>Between 1993 and 1998 the escalator's impact on the fuel prices was mitigated by the 40% real terms fall in the price of crude oil. Last year the price rose as Opec and continued world growth ensured undersupply. The sharp rise last spring led to the average price of diesel rising by 14% between 1999 and 2000. </p> <p>The government was slow to see that it could not go on milking the motorist for \u00a322bn in taxes a year. Antipathy to the Sun-reading, self-employed lorrymen runs deep in the Labour party. Labour conspiracy theorists, for instance, point to the Conservative domination of the Road Haulage Association. </p> <p>Martin O'Neill, the chairman of the industry select committee, said not long ago: \"Everyone knows truck drivers are some of the biggest whingers in the world.\" </p> <p><b> Antipathy</b><br> </p> <p> In April last year an attempt by the then transport minister, John Reid, to placate the industry by setting up a road haulage forum was only partly successful. The forum, from which ordinary hauliers were excluded, tended to be convened by ministers in the wake of direct action. </p> <p>Even the hauliers' breakthrough in March 2000 - when Mr Brown scrapped the escalator and cut vehicle excise duty - was not enough. The price of oil was still rising and the RHA threatened a day of disruption in London on July. The Treasury grudgingly agreed to a meeting to discuss the RHA's pet idea for an essential users' rebate and in return the RHA shelved the protest. But these leisurely negotiations were rudely interrupted by the men at Stanlow and their protest. </p> <p>On Friday, as pickets spread, the industry secretary, Stephen Byers, was in Hanover, but he asked energy department officials to meet oil companies that day. By the afternoon it was agreed that two privy councillors in the department should fly to Balmoral on Monday to seek emergency powers from the Queen. It was agreed to keep the plan secret to avoid panic. </p> <p>Officials worked around the clock at the weekend preparing a list of designated petrol stations to be used for emergency supplies. Downing Street prepared a full propaganda offensive. But as the French government capitulated it started to dawn on ministers that they had a full-scale taxpayers' revolt on their hands. Petrol stations in the north-west were running dry. </p> <p>Still not aware of the impact of the protests on petrol supplies in the north, Mr Blair decided to go ahead with a two-day tour of the Midlands and Yorkshire designed to promote the e-economy. His staff had spent days preparing the trip and a sudden cancellation might trigger an atmosphere of panic. He did not want to stimulate panic buying. </p> <p>Nevertheless he inserted a no-surrender passage in his speech in Loughborough on Monday: \"We cannot and we will not alter government policy on petrol through blockades and pickets. That's not the way to make policy in Britain and as far as I'm concerned it never will be.\" He told journalists the police had assured him the exits from the refineries were clear and there was no reason for the tanker drivers not to go out. He was adamant he would not allow what had happened in France to happen in Britain, and said oil prices would fall, but could not give a date. He tried to keep calm. </p> <p>But the energy minister, Helen Liddell, admitted yesterday that Monday was the day the crisis spiralled out of control. She said: \"The fact that a week's supply of petrol sold out in a few hours last Monday is something we had not factored into our consideration.\" Ministers also began to realise that Britain has one of the most efficient national logistics supply chain managements in the world. It means companies do not keep large stocks, but are extremely vulnerable to blockages in the flow of goods. The knock-on effect to the mail, food stores and hospitals was rapid. </p> <p>The government's attempts to exude an air of calm collapsed on Monday night when the decision to take emergency powers appeared in the court circular of the Times. Journalists on Mr Blair's media bus were read a statement from Downing Street urging the public not to panic. </p> <p>By Tuesday morning it was clear Mr Blair would have to race to London to take personal charge. An overnight report for a 6am meeting of the civil contingencies committee described the crisis in the starkest terms. </p> <p>As soon as Mr Blair arrived in Downing Street, he started a round of phone calls with the police and oil executives to try to find out why the drivers were not working. He then made a critical error at an evening press conference, predicting: \"Everything is now in place to get the tankers moving.\" The situation, he said, would start to return to normal within 24 hours. His optimism was a red rag to the protesters. </p> <p>The next day Mr Blair met the poker-faced oilmen to issue instructions for the drivers to work. One official who attended the meetings said: \"We kept asking why their drivers were not working. They kept saying their men were physically intimidated, so we then said give us the evidence and we will make sure the police deal with the problem. Then nothing happened. We went round and round.\" </p> <p>Frustrated cabinet members asked the executives if they were willing to discipline their drivers. They were told that the oil companies did not directly employ many of the drivers, who instead were self-employed subcontractors. At one point ministers discovered one refinery was managed from Milan. Worse still, there was no organisation or protest leader with whom to negotiate. </p> <p>By Wednesday lunchtime, Downing Street decided the protesters and drivers had to understand the consequences of their actions. Sainsbury's said food supplies would run out in days. The Confederation of British Industry said jobs would be lost. The NHS was put on red alert. Although the move has been criticised as scaremongering by the health secretary, Mr Milburn, local health authorities were reporting real shortages. </p> <p>In desperation, Mr Blair deployed 80 tanker lorries from the army, navy and RAF across Britain. \"Real people and real lives will be lost,\" he warned. </p> <p>Frustrated by the oil managers, Mr Brown and Mr Blair turned in private to their old allies in the union movement. Shortly after 4pm, Bill Morris, the Transport and General Workers Union general secretary, sent two of his most senior officials to the Grangemouth refinery. They sat down to talk to the 30 or 40 drivers about to go on to the nightshift. The meeting lasted five hours and heard the drivers' real concerns about intimidation. </p> <p>Two bricks had been thrown and abuse was being hurled at traffic lights. They were worried they might inadvertently kill some of the protesters, since they cannot see what is happening at the back of the tankers. </p> <p>The union officials hammered out a plan. It would be entirely voluntary for drivers to work. They would go out in a convoy and would be double or even triple manned. They would drive only by day. </p> <p><b> Breakout</b><br> </p> <p> At 11pm the drivers voted to endorse the package and managers agreed. At around 2am the protesters' leaders were told the drivers had voted to start work from the 8am shift. The so-called breakout was finally going to happen. The protesters had little choice but to accept. </p> <p>So by early Thursday morning, the farmers and road hauliers in the darkness of Grangemouth knew the game was effectively up. The news spread quickly. </p> <p>The Stanlow protesters were in the mood to quit, anyway. Mr Williams had tried to stop the protest the day before, according to Mr Swan, because he \"thought the whole thing had got far too big and political groups might take it over\". </p> <p>\"The pressure was too much and anyway we had our point. We wanted to leave in a dignified way and we did.\"</p>",
  "<p>Making up any list of modern classics always poses a problem. A definitive classic supposedly survives the test of time; it shouldn't date, it appeals to successive generations - and although the first half of the 20th century is now receding, who is to say that most of the Beats won't go the way of the Victorian Spasmodics? And then, with the recently extended copyright law giving an author a full posthumous span of three score years and 10 in which his or her estate can collect royalties before falling into the public domain, no single publisher is in a position to select freely anyhow.</p> <p>One of the prime marks of recognition of a book as 'classic' in the century of cinema has been the award of a movie adaptation. Sometimes this comes after the book has long been a hallowed part of the literary canon. On the current list Merchant Ivory's grand 1992 Howards End, with Anthony Hopkins, appeared 82 years after the book was published; Coppola's (very free) version of Conrad's 1902 Heart of Darkness, updated to Vietnam in his majestic, suicidal Apocalypse Now, came 77 years later; and John Huston's film of The Dead was 73 years after James Joyce placed it as a troubling, elegiac close to his collection, Dubliners (1914).</p> <p>After such a gap, there are too often inflated expectations, and an air of hushed reverence before the original: the press releases for the resulting big productions typically spend many more words on the elaborate recreation of period costumes and settings than on the meaning and interpretation of the original book.</p> <p>Better films tend to be produced, I think, when a bit less of the patina of awe has encrusted itself on the 'classic'. Richard Brook's 1967 drama-documentary version of Truman Capote's 1966 work of 'faction', In Cold Blood, or John Ford's beautiful though flawed 1940 film of Steinbeck's 1939 bestseller of the Depression, The Grapes of Wrath, certainly did not pause to let the sediment stirred up by publication settle so as to decide on the quality of the vintage.</p> <p>The insatiable appetite of the film industry for stories gets books optioned long before they reach the bookshops. As the 20th century went on, its fiction became more and more influenced by film and film genres, so that one is not surprised to find the adapted authors themselves working on the screenplay - as Graham Greene (with Terence Rattigan) did on the 1947 John Boulting film of his Brighton Rock (1938), released in America as Young Scarface, or as Nabokov did on Kubrick's 1961 Lolita. This tends, except with the most defensive egos, to allow an energising measure of fresh thought and invention to come into the process of refitting a story for the different medium.</p> <p>We are used to Victorian classics being adapted, often for television in serial form (and thus coming closer to the way Dickens and others would first have found their audience). Conveniently for the adapters, Middlemarch and Our Mutual Friend achieve their poetic or symbolic resonance within a framework of narrative realism and indeed a comparatively melodramatic plot. Eisenstein wrote of the way in which the great silent melodramas of DW Griffith recast the vision of Dickens and made it the idiom of mainstream cinema. The modernist literary classics of the early 20th century, on the other hand, and the works of avant gardists following in their tracks, make a radical challenge to earlier conventions and are seldom rattling good yarns in the same way.</p> <p>Before watching it, one wonders why Joseph Strick wanted to make his 1967 film of the astonishingly intricate verbal structure called Ulysses, with Milo O'Shea (of the sitcom Never Mind the Quality, Feel the Width) as Leopold Bloom; and afterwards one still numbly wonders why - especially given the stiltedly hip updating. Louis Malle's frenetic 1960 customising of Raymond Queneau's playful, compulsively punning novel Zazie in the Metro uses speeded-up motion less amusingly than Dick Lester's A Hard Day's Night (1964) and is in David Thomson's words 'a crushingly unfunny film'. Even the great Orson Welles stumbled in 1962 over Kafka's masterpiece The Trial (1925) \u00d0 which one likes to imagine being instantly turned into a German Expressionist silent psychological horror like The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari (1919). Welles updates it to include tower blocks and computers, although his version is full of gloriously nightmarish felicities.</p> <p>Modernist narrative techniques seem to work best in cinema indirectly, when reconfigured and applied to genre subjects, as in John Boorman's fragmented noir Point Blank (1967) or this year's The Limey by Steven Soderbergh \u00d0 whose underrated Kafka (1991) shows his modernist credentials. Less ostentatiously experimental narratives like Muriel Spark's The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961), keeping within realist conventions, working through portrayal of character, and telling a story of coming of age, but none the less a brilliantly poised piece of literary art, do best as films.</p> <p>But one should not generalise too inflexibly about the relations of books to films. After all, a 50-page novella by Colette about the paradoxically genteel world of Parisian mistresses became a full-blown MGM musical by Vincente Minnelli, Gigi (1958), that was surprisingly faithful. Kipling's Jungle Books (1894-5) became an unforgettable Disney cartoon musical in 1967. And Norman Mailer's spellbinding book The Fight (1975) on the Ali-Foreman 'rumble in the jungle' is obviously an inspiration for the wonderful documentary When We Were Kings by Leon Gast (1996), in which Mailer appears, retelling his story. Indeed, even where the film versions have been successful, these are all cases where it pays to go back to the book.</p>",
  "We are individuals as well as social beings, and open to accusations of selfishness and hypocrisy. In principle, I am opposed to capital punishment. But then I think of the people I would like to kill, and I wonder what I would do if I were minister for executions. And I realise quite what a bad idea capital punishment is. <p>Or let us take the hot issue of transport. Clearly, we need more people to use public transport. But, if I'm selfish, I can't say I'd look forward to that, because I already use it and am frequently stuck behind people who seem to be using it for the first time. Railway ticket staff operate as a counselling service, dealing with endless inquiries from inexperienced passengers: \"So the train will just stop, and I don't have to hold my hand out or wave or anything. Right. And which platform is it?... Oh, I see, it depends where I'm going. Well where are some good places to go?\" </p> <p>Then of course, there is the whole issue of road usage. Very few people want the car banned, and none of them can drive. That's merely an observation; I'm not saying you have to be guilty of something before you say it should be illegal. That would mean that you believe in one law for yourself and another for everyone else. I don't know what's worse, denunciations of dope-smoking from people who don't happen to like it, or people who secretly smoke it? And is it hypocritical or selfless for a politician to promote heterosexual marriage when his own interests clearly lie elsewhere? </p> <p>When it comes to motoring and tax, accusations of hypocrisy fly like the pickets we used to see in the happier days when the law allowed protests by people other than the self-employed. Union leaders who denounced this week's protests were, quite unjustifiably, accused of using militant tactics themselves. In fact, they sold their members out years ago. The Liverpool dockers got no more support from the T and G than they did from the hauliers. The TUC should not be denouncing others for bringing the country to a standstill, but remembering that it can be done. </p> <p> Rightwing commentators of the \"am I the only person who is heartily sick...?\" variety rage against \"union muscle\" as though union relaxation exercises hadn't replaced it. Tabloid Falangists herald a revolt by white self-employed Britain, and churn out made-up anecdotes to prove that a \"new establishment\" of gays, asylum seekers and anti-racist environmentalists now run the world and are all hypocrites. \"A taxi driver I know was driving a well-dressed millionaire teacher to a champagne reception hosted by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. There she was, banging on about cruelty to pets and he looked around, and surprise, surprise, not only was her handbag leather, but in it were the severed heads of six kittens.\" </p> <p>The right accuse those of us who advocate higher income tax of really wanting \"higher taxes for everyone else\", which doesn't even begin to make sense. I suppose it means that, although we demand properly funded hospitals and schools and redistribution of income, we ourselves would just carry on paying the old tax rate and the government would be unable to do anything about it. </p> <p>What is true is that when people call for higher taxes, they usually mean progressive direct taxes on individuals and company profits. Indirect taxation is by its nature iniquitous, and yet the EU demands VAT be charged on bridge tolls that people shouldn't have to pay anyway. And it is all very well calling for high fuel taxes if you can easily afford them. </p> <p>Certainly, our roads are congested and our health and environment are being badly damaged. But we need clean air, not dirty air that is a nice earner for the chancellor. Where are the low fares, electric buses and green diesel? Taxes aren't forcing commercial traffic (the principle cause of the problems) off the roads, and if the revenue raised is truly being used to fix the environment, then how exactly? Is the globe being cooled in some way, perhaps by slices of cucumber being placed all over it? In fact, nothing much of anything seems to be being done with the revenue. Otherwise the government could get away with raising it from fuel. </p> <p>If people thought schools and hospitals were enjoying a golden age and genuine efforts were being made to develop clean energy, it would have been easier for ministers to turn the public against hauliers and farmers. The country isn't suddenly in love with diesel fumes and pesticides in the way it once was with Diana. Fuel prices affect everybody but they are not the only factor in people's view of the world, even if they are unfair. In fact, some of those protesting this week wouldn't have been doing so if they genuinely believed that good comes from the fuel taxes they pay. They weren't all selfish rightwing bastards. Not all taxi drivers are Tories. </p> <p><br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "\"Listen,\" said Peter. \"You're not here. I'm not here. This never happened. Right ?\" <p>Right. So perhaps I'd better begin by saying that Peter, which isn't, of course, his name, doesn't run a restaurant. Nor was I eating there one night this week with the actress wannabe and the guy putting on the punk art exhibition. </p> <p>Confused? Don't worry. Just feed a Deutschmark to the fish and relax. Take a glass of wine and help yourself to some food. </p> <p>The food is excellent. The wine is superb. And great care has been taken with the decor, which is in a style that pretty much beggars description. Sixties' retro crossed with Roman Catholic kitsch comes somewhere near it. </p> <p>There is a hanging lampshade made from an old salon hair dryer. There are tables made from barrels. There are candles in little spherical holders. There are op art designs on the wall. But there are also paintings of visionary peasant girls. And teddy bears. Lots and lots of teddy bears. </p> <p>The effect is eccentric, yet supremely cosy, and central to the whole exercise is the fish made of glass and brass. </p> <p>Everyone coming in must put in 1DM. How much more you pay is up to you. From each according to his means, to each according to his needs. Bakunin, who once lived not very far away, would have loved it. </p> <p>Peter's restaurant is one of several that have sprung up in Berlin on similar lines. </p> <p>In some, as this one, the food is little more than an afterthought. In others it is the main attraction. One, I have been told, serves good Japanese noodle soup. </p> <p>They operate in premises with short - sometimes, you suspect, non-existent - leases, so that every few months the proprietor has to pack up his pots and pans and move on. Peter and his ilk are truly galloping gourmets. This, he said, was his fifth location in three and a half years. </p> <p>It began when some friends with a shop \"threw a party that was so good it turned into a regular event\". </p> <p>\"Their business moved on to other premises, but the party stayed, and after a while the hosts began asking the guests to put in whatever they felt they could afford to cover the cost of the food and drink.\" </p> <p>I said there were \"several\" because neither I nor, I imagine, anyone else, knows how many there are at any one time. News of where they are passes solely by word of mouth. We are talking underground catering. No licences. No tax. No health inspections. </p> <p>And in a country so regulated that most shops cannot, by law, stay open beyond 8.00pm, one of the capital's gastronomic speakeasies is so security-conscious that you have to climb in by a window. </p> <p>But do people like Peter actually make a profit? \"Sure, I make a profit!\" </p> <p>It would no doubt be worth a business school researcher doing a study of these discretionary-payment eateries to find out if pricing is, in fact, redundant. The contented smile on Peter's face as he emptied bottle after bottle of wine into customers' glasses suggested it could be: that, left to their own devices, more people err on the generous than the mean side. </p> <p>Some, though, don't pay at all. Like the first couple to leave Peter's establishment on the night I visited. </p> <p>On such occasions, what is the alternative-business etiquette? Does the proprietor cough decorously behind his hand as he holds open the door? Not exactly. On this occasion what he did was grasp his right bicep with his left hand and raise an erect finger in an unmistakable gesture of contempt at the retreating backs.</p>",
  "<p>I met Primo Levi at his home in Turin one hot summer's day in 1986. He was in shirt sleeves for the interview, and the tattoo '74517' was visible on his left forearm. 'A typical German talent for classification,' he said. The humour seemed bleak but characteristic. </p> <p>In February 1944 Levi was deported to Auschwitz with 650 other Jews (of which only 490 have since been identified). Following his return to northern Italy in late 1945 the need to bear witness was so intense that he would write on scraps of paper anywhere - in factories, trams and trains. Driven to tell his story, Levi completed If This is a Man within 10 months. No other work conveys the unique horror of the Nazi genocide more directly and profoundly, or interrogates our recent moral history so incisively. For its quiet testimony of man's cruelty to man, it remains one of the essential books of our age.</p> <p>Primo Levi was just 27 when his Auschwitz memoir was published in Turin. No one wanted to read it; talk of the war and deportation was taboo in post-Fascist Italy. Levi's first book nevertheless was a remarkable literary document that revealed wide-ranging influences from Dante to Darwin. The prose had a beautiful lucidity which owed much to the author's background in chemistry. A bright and precocious student, Levi had graduated with honours in chemistry in Turin in 1941. He wrote his sentences with a chemist's attention to molecular structure and balance. </p> <p>All his life Levi was prone to periodic black moods. On April 11 1987, more than 42 years after his rescue from Auschwitz, he fell to his death. Newspapers reported that Levi had pitched himself down the stairwell of his Turin apartment; his body was found at the foot of a lift shaft, four flights below. Though Levi had suffered depression long before he was deported, many were quick to attribute his suicide to Auschwitz. In America there was even some moral outrage at his self-destruction. The efficacy of Levi's words, it was reckoned, had been cancelled by his suicide; Levi had cheated his readers with a last and terrible act of denial. The belief remains as vulgar as it is short-sighted. Levi's books remain, and those books are matchless. </p> <p>In spite of his responsibilities as a chemist, Levi was committed to the writing which finally brought him international acclaim. His poems, science fiction, essays and short stories are now loved by a wide readership for their intelligence and wise humanity. Yet it was Auschwitz, and the moral and material ruins of post-Nazi Europe, that provided Levi with his most enduring subject matter. His best books draw on autobiography. </p> <p>The book that made Levi's name abroad was The Periodic Table when it appeared in 1975. A collection of semi-autobiographical tales loosely structured around the chemical table of elements, the book is wonderfully daring. In prose of tight, functional elegance, all Levi's vital experience is here, from his deportation to Auschwitz to his post-war recovery as a writer and a chemist. The Periodic Table bridges the two cultures in new and thrilling ways. Its extraordinary shifts of tone, from learned scientific treatise to epic war narrative, reflect Levi's eclectic reading and mesmeric story-telling gifts. </p> <p>The memoir also pays tender homage to Turin. Levi spent most of his life in his birthplace and the city influenced him in a number of ways. Turin is famously symmetrical - all streets intersect at right angles - and something of its austere, checkerboard design infuses his books with their carefully wrought prose and precise craft. The Turinese are renowned for their industry and measured, methodical ways. In their clipped, Frenchified dialect they like to say: 'Esageroma nen' - don't exaggerate. Levi upheld this faith in the virtue of concision. </p> <p>His birthplace has a dark reputation, though. Many of De Chirico's surrealist landscapes, with their sinister broken statues and endless colonnades, are portraits of Levi's Turin. The city's geometry need not square with rational behaviour. Friedrich Nietzsche reputedly went mad in Turin; before Levi, the Piedmontese poet Cesare Pavese took his life there. Yet Levi remained deeply attached to Turin. Generations of his family had lived under its influence. He met his wife and raised two children there.</p> <p>Levi had scarcely begun his studies at Turin University in October 1937 when Mussolini prepared for anti-Jewish legislation. The Italian dictator had been disdainful of Hitler and the Nazi 'barbarians' north of the Alps. However, a fatal new alliance was forged in 1936 when Italy sided with Germany in the Spanish Civil War. Now that Mussolini had hitched his carnival chariot to the Fuhrer's funeral hearse, Italian Jewry was in grave danger. By March-April 1938 the Fascist media united to create an all-out onslaught of racial abuse. Levi's family listened fearfully that spring as the Jewish Question was endlessly discussed in Fascist debates on the wireless. Like most Italian Jews they hoped that Mussolini's anti-semitic propaganda would 'blow over'. They couldn't imagine how much worse was to come. </p> <p>On July 14 1938 came a turning point in the fortunes of Italian Jewry, which eventually led to Levi's deportation. The news that bright July morning, splashed on the front page of Italian newspapers, was headed 'The Manifesto of Racist Scientists'. Commissioned by Mussolini and signed by a group of Italian pseudo-biologists, the document earnestly demonstrated that Italian Jews did not belong to the Italian race. Instead they were a contaminant akin to the Nazis' Fremdksrper - an alien within the state. </p> <p>Levi's family reacted with shock, confusion, then incredulity. More than 10,000 of Italy's Jews were Fascist party members - roughly a third of the country's adult Jewish population. Mussolini had supported the bourgeois-patriotic ideals of Italian Jews, but now after 17 years of Fascist rule he had betrayed his own most loyal subjects. </p> <p>The dictator's race police quickly went to work. Data was gathered on every living Jew in Italy - name, address, profession - and set down with lapidary coldness in official communiques. This information proved invaluable for the Germans when they occupied northern Italy in autumn 1943 and began to root out Jews for deportation. </p> <p>For the first time in his 19 years, Levi was forced to acknowledge the stigma of his racial origin. Italian Jews were different from Italians not just because they were Jews, but because they were non-Aryans. And who exactly were the Aryans? No one in Italy seemed to know, though sure enough Fascist notices began to appear in Turin: 'Jews are not welcome here.' All over Italy it was the same. Within 18 months of Mussolini's race legislation some 5,500 Jews had left Italy - more than one 10th of the country's Jewish community. On November 29 1938, the Jewish publisher Angelo Formiggini threw himself from the belltower of Modena cathedral in a bid to draw the world's attention to the persecution. News of his suicide was suppressed. </p> <p>The pressure continued throughout 1938 as Mussolini issued ever more severe restrictions. Levi's university papers from this period are marked with the condemnation: 'Appartiene alla razza ebraica' (belongs to the Jewish race). These words, rubber-stamped on to a document, were all it took to seal a man's fate. Unsurprisingly, the memory of the Fascist persecution runs through all Levi's work. The genius of The Periodic Table lies in its myriad metaphors drawn from chemistry and Fascist race discrimination. 'I am the impurity that makes the zinc react, I am the grain of salt or mustard.' </p> <p>As Mussolini tightened his hold on Jews, Levi cultivated a careful detachment. Some Catholic university friends reproached him for this response. They felt Levi should be more indignant. The calm reasonableness of If This is a Man (Levi's declared intention was to furnish 'documentation for a quiet study of certain aspects of the human mind') has likewise encouraged readers to think of Levi as a forgiver. But while Levi wanted to understand the Germans, he was not inclined to forgive, not after Auschwitz, and probably never. </p> <p>Even within the Fascist Party, corruption was so widespread that forged passports and 'Aryanisation' certificates were available, at a price. The German consul in Turin, Dr Dirk von Langen, impatiently agitated for stricter anti-semitic measures. On December 13, Levi was rounded up by Fascist militia and sent to a camp.</p> <p>In Auschwitz, because of his university qualification, Levi was put to work as a chemist in a synthetic-rubber factory. After 11 months of appalling hardship he was liberated in January 1945 by the Red Army. The SS had considered Levi an 'economically useful Jew', and without chemistry he may not have survived the camp. Afterwards Levi saw chemistry as his life's salvation and he pursued his trade long after the war. Back in Turin, his life was divided sometimes uneasily between factory and typewriter, family and friends. The chemical plant where Levi worked until 1977 at first looks grimly inimical to the solitary profession of writing. Yet from this dual life as writer and chemist came enduring literature. </p> <p>Towards the end of his life Levi was depressed and weighed down by domestic problems. He was working on a collection of imaginary letters from a scientist to a wealthy Turinese patron (they explained various scientific and chemical phenomena) but the writing was blocked. Levi was troubled by other matters. Almost the last newspaper article he wrote, 'The Black Hole of Auschwitz', bitterly indicted the new generation of German historians who contended that the Nazi genocide was not a unique instance of human infamy but just one link in a chain reaction that started with the Russian gulags and went on to Vietnam and beyond. Levi clearly was horrified by this move to diminish what he saw as man's defining atrocity. Elsewhere he spoke of the 'laido conato' (loathsome effort) of revisionist historians like David Irving. For a man who rarely raised his voice, these were strong words.</p> <p>Auschwitz was the catalyst that turned Levi into a writer. But whether the depression that enveloped him in the final months was compounded by his terrible past can only be speculation. The books remain, and these show what a genius was lost to the literary world.</p>"
