  "<p>Newcastle United manager Bobby Robson enjoyed this one. 'It's not been a bad day for me,' he smiled afterwards - and Robson was not just talking about his team's first Premiership victory at home since the end of August. </p> <p>He had also seen ample evidence that Ipswich, the other love of his football life after his 14 years at Portman Road, are again in safe hands under George Burley. Burley, an assured full-back during that successful era in East Anglia, might even have emerged with a draw in this encounter with the man who once controlled his playing career. </p> <p>But a controversial penalty won by Alan Shearer eventually ended Town's attempt to extend their unbeaten run to seven games - and Burley couldn't even win the verbal exchange which inevitably followed. Ipswich were upset at referee Alan Wily's decision to award the 67th-minute penalty after Shearer's surge into the area was halted by Mark Venus's challenge. </p> <p>'The ref was 50 or 60 yards away, the crowd shouts, Alan Shearer falls and he gives a penalty,' said Burley. 'Mark didn't think it was a penalty and, if it had been at the other end, I know which way it would have gone.' </p> <p>It was an impassioned argument which Robson dismantled with one sentence. 'Alan will tell you a different story - and he might have been a bit closer than George,' said the Newcastle manager. </p> <p>Not that Robson was overly impressed with Mr Wiley. He questioned why Venus was not sent off - a valid point given that he was the last man - but added: 'So many strange decisions were given out there today that I'm not surprised he sent the guy off.' </p> <p>The penalty was not Shearer's only crucial contribution to a match that threatened to slip away from Newcastle in the early stages. Marcus Stewart collected his sixth goal of the season after keeper Shay Given turned away Jermaine Wright's shot through a crowd area and Ipswich's thoughtful passing style kept them in control until Shearer's first contribution. </p> <p>He collected Alain Goma's raking through ball on his chest before turning it past keeper Richard Wright in the 23rd minute. It was a goal that altered the balance of the game. Newcastle almost added further goals through Gary Speed and Kieron Dyer, who otherwise made a negligible impression against his former club. </p> <p>And, while Dyer did have to deflect a Matt Holland header off the line in the 41st minute, the game was slipping away from Town before the decisive penalty incident. </p> <p>Robson thought it fitting that Shearer was the match winner. 'He was absolutely outstanding. It was a great exhibition of centre forward play,' said the Newcastle manager, who also appreciated what is being built by Burley. </p> <p>'Give them credit,' he said. 'They are a fine footballing team. We've been beaten by teams who didn't play as well as they did today.'</p>",
  "<p>It has not been the best of weeks in Yorkshire, and most of the county will understand how Bradford now feel. A bright start by Charlton submerged a visiting team simply unable to stem the flow of defeats away from home. </p> <p>Chris Hutchings' side are looking increasingly out of their depth at this level - they have now played each of the Premiership's promoted sides, and they have lost every time. These two sides had never previously met at this level and, after a sorry display that ended in the last-minute dismissal of their assistant manager Stuart McCall, it may be a while before the Bantams return to the Valley. </p> <p>Stan Collymore stole the pre-match attention. And he didn't even have to be here to do so. After his astonishing debut goal against Leeds, the troubled striker was withdrawn against Newcastle in midweek and did not even make the trip to the Valley. </p> <p>Also out was Benito Carbone, with 36-year-old Dean Saunders preferred to the underperforming Italian. Whatever the reasoning, Bradford were toothless. Charlton, meanwhile, were ruthless. </p> <p>Twice in the first 20 minutes, Graham Stuart breached Bradford's pretence of a defence, which simply could not cope with his intelligent running from deep. In the fourth minute, Mathias Svensson found him sadly unmarked to advance into the area, draw Matt Clarke and square the ball to leave Jonatan Johansson with the simplest of tap-ins. </p> <p>Bradford did not learn their lesson. Fourteen minutes later, Stuart picked up the ball 50 yards out and advanced untroubled to the edge of the box, played a sweet one-two with Johansson and chipped the ball over Clarke. While Ward twice came close for the away side, only wayward shooting and Clarke's agility saved Bradford from first-half humiliation. </p> <p>Charlton probably believed that the game was then won. That would certainly explain their second-half performance - where they had built their lead on pace, aggression and hunger, in the second period they seemed to have had their fill. </p> <p>They should, though, have extended their lead in the 54th minute when Chris Powell's low centre was inexplicably missed by Svensson. Bradford returned the favour six minutes later - both Ward and Saunders failing to connect with Jamie Lawrence's cross.</p>",
  "<p>Tottenham's fans came to bury George Graham and his side but but were praising them to the rooftops at the end of a hard-fought and thrilling victory. The White Hart Lane faithful - or should that be fickle? - have been making their protests against manager Graham and chairman Alan Sugar loud and clear following a slide down the Premiership and humiliation at home to Birmingham in the Worthington Cup. But this win, and the committed manner in which it was achieved, was just the tonic Tottenham and their supporters needed, and the threatened protests never materialised. </p> <p>Fired up from the start, Spurs matched Sunderland man for man and tackle for tackle, and got their reward when Chris Armstrong scored the winning goal shortly after going on as substitute for his first appearance of the season. Even the dismissal of left-back Ben Thatcher in the closing minutes, for his second yellow card, could not dampen the mood of the camp. They even applauded Ramon Vega, an obvious target of derision after some abject performances in place of the injured Sol Campbell as Tottenham's defence became unlike any sort of rearguard associated with Graham. </p> <p>The Scot's response was true to his stereotype - he put a extra man at the back. Luke Young was called in as the ' catenaccio' - or bolt - behind Vega and Chris Perry, and the England under-21 defender certainly kept Kevin Phillips under lock and key for most of the game. Last season's golden-boot winner has found it harder this time around, with only four Premiership goals so far, and he squandered a golden chance in the 37th minute. </p> <p>With the natives growing restless after seeing their side's early rampage come to nothing, Sunderland were awarded a penalty when Vega handled the ball inside the area for the second week running. Phillips sent goalkeeper Neil Sullivan the wrong way but also put his shot the wrong side of the bar. As Peter Reid said afterwards, 'I felt the crowd were starting to get at them and it would have been interesting if we'd scored then.' </p> <p>That mistake was compounded when Tim Sherwood put Tottenham ahead a minute before half-time, shooting in from close range after Steve Clemence's corner had rebounded off defender Jody Craddock. It was no less than Spurs deserved after Thomas Sorensen had made impressive saves from a Les Ferdinand header, a Darren Anderton shot and a Ramon Vega flick - the pick a close-range save to tip over a thumping Ferdinand volley, and as Graham admitted: 'I thought it was going to be one of those days.' Sorensen was certainly less busy in the second half than Sullivan, who was given little chance when Don Hutchison rose unopposed at the far post to head home Michael Gray's deep free-kick from the left after 63 minutes. </p> <p>But Spurs regained the lead 15 minutes later shortly after Armstrong replaced Sergei Rebrov, who was struggling for fitness. An ankle injury had kept Armstrong out of action since the summer, but he showed no signs of ring rust as he raced on to Sherwood's fine pass to slide a shot under Sorensen for the winner, leaving his team-mates, manager and supporters to celebrate. </p> <p>'Armstrong didn't know he was going to be involved until this morning and I was pleased for him. All the players deserve credit for their commitment and for coping with the change of formation. 'We've been leaking a few goals recently and I thought we need to tighten up a bit.'</p>",
  "<p>Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, England's coach-in-waiting, was approached twice before to take control of team affairs at Lancaster Gate. And, in another twist to the England tale, it has emerged that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger turned down the opportunity to take England into last month's World Cup qualifying game against Finland. </p> <p>Eriksson, unveiled by the FA last week as successor to Kevin Keegan, was first approached in 1996 when the FA decided not to renew Terry Venables's contract as coach. He was sounded out by a third party and was interested in the FA's move. </p> <p>A source close to Eriksson said: 'Sven was flattered and talked about the job but he did not believe he was ready - at that stage in his career - to take the England job. In any case, the FA did not progress their interest to a formal interview or approach and Glenn Hoddle was revealed as their choice shortly afterwards.' </p> <p>The FA moved again for Eriksson last year when Hoddle's reign collapsed amid controversy over his remarks about the disabled and his ill-timed book on the 1998 World Cup. </p> <p>'Sven got another approach when Hoddle was forced to resign but on that occasion the job went quickly to Kevin Keegan,' The Observer was told. 'It's not surprising that they should have kept him in mind because the FA's David Dein, who helped arrange his release from Lazio, has known all about Eriksson for some time - as have other influential figures at the FA.' </p> <p>England's flirtation with a controversial first foreign appointment is lent extra spice by the disclosure that Eriksson has had his heart set on the job for 16 years. Roberto Clagluna, Eriksson's former managerial partner at Roma, said his colleague had England in mind back in 1984. </p> <p>'One of the first things Sven said to me when he arrived in Italy in 1984 was, \"One day, Roberto, I'm going to be the manager of England.\" It has always been his biggest dream. </p> <p>'I had to teach him everything about Italian football but he knew English football very well, because he loved it.' </p> <p>After a couple of false starts, Eriksson has done it. Dein's role in fixing the successor to Keegan becomes increasingly influential after The Observer learned of the FA's move for Wenger, Dein's club manager at Arsenal, to take over in the post-Keegan emergency last month. When Keegan walked away from the job after the 1-0 defeat against Germany at Wembley, the FA needed to act swiftly. </p> <p>The FA technical director, Howard Wilkinson, was not at Wembley and an initial sounding was made for Wenger to take England into the World Cup qualifier against Finland in Helsinki four days later - almost certainly through Dein. </p> <p>But Wenger declined that request and, possibly taking his initial rebuff as a guide, the chief executive, Adam Crozier, and his panel charged with finding a successor to Keegan did not follow up their interest with a formal approach about the long-term position - something that will surprise many observers who saw Wenger as the right material for the job. </p> <p>Another ingredient in the Eriksson story is interest from Manchester United. He has been approached in the past about succeeding Sir Alex Fer guson when the Old Trafford manager retires. </p> <p>'When he was under fire at Lazio last season when the title race went to the wire, that looked a very attractive option,' our source said. 'He was under considerable pressure but knowing that he was interesting one of the biggest clubs in the world provided some solace. And he may have doubted whether he was ready for England in the past - but not now.'</p>",
  "<p>There was once a football manager who asked a player he was intending to sign what his problem was: 'Is it booze, drugs or women, son? Because I'll find out sooner or later.' </p> <p>What was interesting about the question - quite apart from the generalised assumption that every professional footballer has some off-the-field Achilles heel that will undermine his aptitude and attitude on the field - is that the question of gambling did not come up. It went without saying, simply wasn't an issue. The old image of the English manager is that he has always liked a bet himself, and didn't mind if his players did. </p> <p>That much was seen last week when it emerged that some England players were involved in card schools for hands of \u00a310,000 during Euro 2000. That is a conservative figure. It disturbed several senior players, who were concerned about the effect on the morale and condition of their team-mates. </p> <p>Kevin Keegan himself made no secret of his fondness for horse racing and the Racing Channel was also piped into the team's hotel in Belgium. Video race nights also took place, with Alan Shearer as the bookie, though these were less of a worry and seen more as a harmless outlet for recreation among people who naturally have a competitive streak. They ceased before the friendly in France in September, with Shearer now retired. </p> <p>We are talking now of oaks and small acorns but there are fears from some in the English game that gambling is an emerging problem for players with time on their hands and more money than ever in their pockets. It could indeed, after drink and drugs, be the next big issue football has to confront. </p> <p>Alcohol was probably regarded, too, as a harmless recreational outlet in English football a decade ago. Now with the influx of overseas players and coaches, with their cultural and professional differences, and the scientific evidence of how the effects of drinking contribute to injuries and sluggish performance, there is a new mood. The top professionals have come to see how moderation, even abstinence, can increase the chances of success and longevity of career, with its attractive consequence of increased earning capacity. </p> <p>As for mood-altering drugs, the rash of bans among young players of a few years ago seems to have slowed, due partly to more testing - though still haphazard in the English game - and partly to increased awareness of the career damage it will do. Gambling, though? How can that recreational pursuit be equated with drink or drugs as a threat to a club's prospects and the career of a player? </p> <p>There are other reasons for fewer headlines on the drink and drugs front. Many players are now concerned that they will find themselves splashed across the papers as the result of some bender or brush with drugs, often grassed up by some media-conscious punter in pub or nightclub. More keep themselves to themselves, sad as that may be both for them and a largely respectful public who revere their heroes, the distancing caused by a sinister, threatening minority. </p> <p>With more money than ever finding its way into players' pockets, though, there is some evidence that those with a penchant for seeking a thrill may instead be turning more to betting, notably on sizeable card schools as well as football itself. In these days of phone and internet accounts, the latter is simple and private, after all. In fact, it could well be that if the warning signs are not heeded, gambling will become the new drinking. </p> <p>'It may not yet be something you have to worry about but something you have to keep an eye on,' says the Liverpool manager, G\u00e9rard Houllier. 'The top players have time and they have money. What else are they going to spend it on? They have cars and they have clothes. They are not going to have two steaks on their plate.' It is the point about time and money that so strikes the modern chord. </p> <p>'Yes, I do see more players betting these days and with bigger sums of money involved,' says the Aston Villa and England player Paul Merson, a self-confessed gambling addict who has not now had a bet for more than 18 months, his last spree costing him \u00a335,000 in a month. 'Betting on football is popular, other teams than your own that is, because there is football on every night of the week now. Cards is also a favourite.' </p> <p>Betting is nothing new among footballers. Horse racing has always been seen as a harmless leisure-time occupation for players, who accept with resignation like the rest of the population that a horse can take several thousand people for a ride at the same time, and that for every pay-out window in a betting shop there are three marked 'Bet here'. </p> <p>The World Health Organisation declared gambling an addiction, to rank alongside alcoholism, in 1986, but only a few such as Peter Shilton and Stan Bowles have been known to get themselves into real trouble. 'If Stan could pass a betting shop like he can pass a ball, then he'd have no worries at all,' said his manager at Crewe Alexandra, Ernie Tagg. The tradition also of owning horses, made famous in the Seventies by stars such as Keegan, Mick Channon and Alan Ball, is being carried on by Sir Alex Ferguson, David Platt and Michael Owen. </p> <p>The potential for excess, though, is growing - as shown by Keith Gillespie when losing tens of thousands while at Newcastle United a few years ago - with ever-increasing sums going on football, both through fixed odds and on spread betting. A decade ago, football accounted for only a couple of per cent of the total sum gambled in this country; now it has more than doubled at five per cent, even if it is still way behind the 70 per cent on horse racing and even 10 to 15 per cent on greyhounds. </p> <p>Money changing hands at Premiership card schools has also increased. One Premiership player told me that 'pots' on his club's coach can reach \u00a37,000. 'It always starts off normal then gets out of hand,' he said. </p> <p>Professionals betting on games is a grey area. FA rules say players are allowed to do the football pools but if they are found to be betting on a football match, they have to prove to the FA that they were not 'insider-dealing' and had no potential knowledge of the outcome or were unable to influence it. Steve Claridge, well known in the game as a gambler, says that when he was fined \u00a3900 by the FA earlier this year for backing his own team, Portsmouth, to win a match, the tribunal had to check the rules themselves then told him he could bet on matches outside his division. </p> <p>Indeed, the FA's attitude to gambling seems remarkably lax. Graham Sharpe, media relations director of William Hill, is also a director of Wealdstone FC; as a bookmaker he should be disqualified from the post. 'I rang the FA and told them but they said they were aware and had no problem with it,' he says. </p> <p>In horse racing, moves are afoot by governing bodies to disqualify anyone within the industry from gambling, jockeys already being banned, and there are suggestions that it could also soon apply to football. 'I don't object to that,' says Claridge, 'but then football isn't corrupt. It would have come out long before now.' Indeed, it should be said that the Bruce Grobbelaar affair a few years ago resulted in the former Liverpool goalkeeper being found not guilty. </p> <p>Sometimes it is the markets that prevent corruption. There was a story within football a year or two ago that one team deliberately kicked the ball into touch from the kick-off so that they could cash in on a bet on the time of the first throw-in. Losing bookmakers have since stopped offering that particular gamble. </p> <p>'In practical terms, you can't stop a jockey from betting and to pretend you can is sheer folly,' says Sharpe. 'He has friends, there are phones and computers. The same will be true of trainers in racing so how are you going to enforce it in football? </p> <p>'It's OK to say thou shall not bet on the opposition, and everyone would agree that's wrong, but what's wrong with betting on yourself? They can hand down decrees all they like but you can't stop players betting. How come it's all right for players to bet on the pools? You only need three bent teams to rig the pools, with three aways. And I can tell you, we get any number of football clubs phoning us up wanting to bet on their team for promotion, so they can cover the cost of the bonuses. What's the difference between that and insurance?' </p> <p>Claridge says: 'More players do have a flutter these days, and more players are betting on football than before. I suppose the more money there is the more people are going to do it because there are more outlets. But for me, drink is still more of a problem in the game. I've come across more drinkers than gamblers, though at the top end of the scale these days I suppose it may be more of a problem. If you've got plenty of money, you are going to live life to the maximum.' </p> <p>A new fear among some managers is the amount of money changing hands in card schools. The appeal, says Merson, is that 'it is the ultimate bet. The out come is in your own hands'. Claridge says that card schools are almost hereditary at clubs. 'At Leicester there was a money card school but not for massive amounts, but there isn't at Portsmouth.' </p> <p>Merson points out an interesting side effect of the events at Euro 2000. 'It was funny,' he says. 'I watched a couple of the England games on television last summer and thought that some of the players looked more tired than I would have expected. Gambling is majorly draining, mentally if not physically, especially if you are losing money.' Adds Houllier significantly: 'The danger is seeing your players lose emotional energy before games.' </p> <p>It is also possible that losing a large sum of money to a team-mate could be bad for morale ahead of a game, though both Merson and Claridge, as honourable gamblers, do not believe it should be a problem: </p> <p>'Not if I'd lost it fair and square,' says Claridge. </p> <p>'No. It would have to be my fault and not his,' says Merson, who believes more in the theory that tiredness is the main enemy. </p> <p>Houllier does allow card schools on the Liverpool team bus but not for money. He also has 'race nights' now and then with no more than \u00a320 staked. He does not object to betting on horse racing in moderation. 'Players need the playing edge, they like something to be always at stake,' he says, arguing that being puritanical can be counterproductive. 'It is what we call the noble uncertainty of the game. They like that and you can't expect them not to. I am a player too. I can bet with \u00a320, that's my playing side.' And only last week Ars\u00e8ne Wenger admitted having backed Sven Goran Eriksson to be England coach. It was just a bit of fun - and he won. </p> <p>Neither Claridge nor Merson believes that gambling is yet a problem within the English game but both agree that with the media eyes on players, and with players getting richer, those who have an addictive personality and seek to indulge it through gambling will proba bly hit the skids sooner in their lives than previous generations. The secretive nature is also a concern. Merson points out that bookmakers are happy to take large sums off a player when he is losing, but publicity is likely to emerge when he starts to win big. </p> <p>'If you are earning a lot, you will probably go down quicker,' says Claridge. 'In a way, it's been good for me because it's kept me playing, kept me hungry. But money doesn't make you a gambler. If you've got an addictive personality, that's what makes you a gambler.' </p> <p>'It's not yet the same threat as drinking or drugs,' says Merson, for whom those substances were secondary addictions, 'but it's definitely one way players look for a thrill or a buzz. I mean, if I walk down the street drunk, everyone is going to know but if I've been doing my money on gambling, no one is really going to notice.' </p> <p>Claridge can see the argument that if the manager is a gambler some players may feel they have to be also if they are to stay in favour. Usually it is the insecure ones, which does not appear to apply to him, as a player at least. 'I reckon I disprove it. I fell out with Alan Ball big time at Portsmouth. It got so bad he wasn't even sharing tips he got for horses with me.' </p> <p>Sharpe would not be surprised if more players were betting these days. 'Although unless well-known footballers walk into a betting shop, it's impossible to say,' he adds. But he concedes that more may be turning to gambling rather than risk the social stigma of other so-called vices. 'It's a valid point throughout society. The majority of people bet responsibly and regard it as a bit of a buzz for those few minutes. They get part-ownership. It's not a life-changing amount usually, just the chance of vindication of their opinion. </p> <p>'I can't get too worried about footballers who overspend. After 27 years in this business at the sharp end of defending it, I've come to a very strong conclusion that it's all down to personal responsibility. It's hard to feel sorry for poor little rich kids who lose \u00a310,000 then go to Adidas or whoever for a bigger contract.' </p> <p>The key point is surely the effect on performance, of which Merson has first-hand experience, and which Houllier fears. 'Clubs in England at the top are definitely on the right path concerning rest and diet but you are always going to get the odd lack of character,' says the Liverpool manager. 'You have got to be careful not to have a side of a player too much involved in gambling.' </p> <p>Just add it to the latest trends and troubles that come with the money washing around in the English game. But at least there is hope, not least in the fact that the new England head coach Sven Goran Eriksson is likely to find it alien to his footballing culture and indulge it no longer. 'We had drinking and smoking as problems in France in the mid-Eighties, and with players gambling on horse racing in the early Nineties,' adds Houllier. 'But it has gone since the academies with their good habits and good attitudes.' </p> <p>So England to win the World Cup in 2006 perhaps? Houllier, a key figure, as technical director, for the 1998 world champions, adds a cautious note. 'I have to say, even in the early Nineties in France, gambling was not in the culture as much as it is in England.'</p>",
  "<p>It's Saturday morning by the Bosphorus and the two most famous people in Norway are talking boats. Behind them a string of vessels that would grace a Bond movie chunter noisily on to one of the world's great waterways. The powerboating Class One circus has come to Istanbul. The Bosphorus - which is usually flat and calm - is probably the fastest track on the Class One circuit, and one of the Norwegians, Bjorn Rune Gjelsten, has particular reason to know it. 'Right here last year we flipped,' he recalls. 'We were pushing really hard to win that race, because we had to win to win the championship. We sat in second place, then came side by side with the leading boat and we ended up flipping in a turn. It was probably the fastest crash in Class One ever. About 145 mph.'</p> <p>So is he nervous to be back here for the first time since then? 'I think everybody should be a little bit nervous,' he says pensively. 'Racing on the real rough, were you're bouncing around, you're hit hard - it aches and it hurts - but it's not that dangerous. It looks dangerous only it's not. But racing here,' he looks out on to the water, 'that can be quite marginal.'</p> <p> Class One - with its mix of speed, money and glamour - is powerboating's equivalent to Formula One, and Gjelsten and Kjell Inge Rokke are among its leading acts. Not that their fame has much to do with water sports. Rokke and Gjelsten made their names as businessmen - Richard Bransons with less facial hair and considerably less negative undertow - and in Norway, where nobody is as famous as a fjord, they pass for royalty. In fact they are more famous than royalty, according to a recent poll.</p> <p> Of course, the very notion of fame in Norway is a bit of an oxymoron: like focusing on America's leading socialists or the best French fast bowlers. In the absence of film stars and pop singers, Rokke and Gjelsten are in the Oslo papers all the time. In Britain they are famous for another reason. Three years ago they purchased Wimbledon FC and have been characterised as 'the mysterious Norwegians' who bought into English football ever since. Later, Gjelsten will tell me that it is only since former owner Sam Hamamm left Wimbledon that he has felt part of the club. 'It feels like we haven't been with the club for a year yet, and how can you be emotionally involved with something for less than a year? I don't think you can. It takes time. But now we have been involved with losing, with being relegated, and that gives you something.' But as they gaze over the glistening water in Istanbul the last things on their minds are a return to the Premiership or John Hartson's fitness.</p> <p> Rokke, the younger and richer of the two, has just returned from a test drive and has dropped in on Gjelsten's Spirit of Norway team for a chat. He looks very much at home, which is hardly surprising not just because the two have known each other for more than 30 years, but because he sold Gjelsten the team a couple of years ago. It's that kind of friendship. </p> <p>With his driving suit tied around his midriff - revealing the Jolly Motors T-shirt of the team he now drives for (but doesn't own) - Rokke looks relaxed as he relives his morning's endeavours. I had been told that the two look alike, which is sort of true even though they don't. Gjeltsen is taller, thinner and, unlike Rokke, wears glasses. Yet their faces lack distinctive features - faces you find it difficult to recall as soon as you look away. Though neither is remotely in the Branson class, Gjelsten is far happier talking to the press than his friend, and comes over for a chat. He first got into powerboating through Kjell (pronounced 'Chell'), he says. Kjell was driving in the US when Gjelsten went over to watch him. 'I made all these comments to him,' Gjelsten recalls. 'He should do this and that. He turned to me and said, \"Bjorn why don't you do it yourself?\" So he did, but not for the reasons you might expect. 'It's not just a question of going out and buying a big boat with the biggest engines,' he says seriously. 'There is a lot of attention to detail. And focus, discipline, being systematic. That appealed to me.' This, it should be said, is exactly what he is famous for as a businessman. He smiles. 'Yeah, I think that maybe is one of my strong sides, and maybe a weak side too: being too focused on details. '</p> <p> Before long the two were racing against each other in Class One, which didn't surprise anyone who knew them. Their friendship can be dated very precisely. Fittingly it began at a competitive event, a cross-country meeting. Both won their respective classes, and afterwards Bjorn's father - a fanatically keen footballer - invited the younger boy to come and stay with them. In doing so he introduced young Rokke to what Gjeltsen himself describes as 'a family where we were always competing'. Bjorn was 10, Kjell eight.</p> <p> There was plenty to compete at but Bjorn seems to have had the upper hand. He excelled at Nordic skiing, going on to represent his country and win international titles. In business, however, Rokke has always held sway, ever since he went off to Seattle as a young man, returning with the reputation as the biggest white fish fisherman in the world - and a lot of money.</p> <p> When they are driving on the water, I ask, are they still competing as they did as kids? 'Oh absolutely, but in a positive way. I think it's good. It drives us.' And - now that he is 44 and Rokke 41- who is the better driver? Pause. 'I think we have different talents,' Gjelsten says diplomatically. 'Kjell was very good before. Then he stayed away a couple of years. He keeps saying that I was dumb to teach him the new tricks. Powerboating has changed a lot in the past two or three years. We've gone from speeds of around 140mph to 160mph. We are now right on the edge when we are racing, we drive slightly different to how we did three years ago.'</p> <p> The combination of Gjelsten's competitiveness and the increased speed of the boats led to the near-disaster last year on the Bosphorus. Gjelsten escaped, if that's the right word, with just a few broken ribs (his throttle man Steve Curtis, he remarks ruefully, only had a cut finger) but the crash left its mark. When Formula One drivers are involved in big crashes they almost invariably return to the fray. But for them it is different. They are professionals. Gjelsten is a very successful businessman for whom driving is - surely - just a hobby. He has a family and a career; why risk it?</p> <p> 'I think you do worry about it sometimes, but your instinct to compete is there,' Gjelsten says. 'For me that's always been the case. For me actually it's more than an advanced hobby. I practise every day. I do my one-hour jog, I go to the gym. I stay fairly fit. Yeah, you can race without being as fit as I am, but you won't win.'</p> <p>Eight minutes. That was the time that Ken Thorne was under water in Oslo earlier this year. He was pushing his boat to the limit - and then she went over. 'I thought I wasn't going to get out of that one,' he says jovially, as if recalling the time he ran out of petrol. 'Eight minutes under water and you think you're a gonner. One hundred and forty to a complete stop in a second.' His memories of the crash remain vivid. 'The cockpit filled up with water in an instant, and then it went completely black. And freezing fucking cold. I had water up my hooter, in my mouth, in my lungs. I'd lost my bearings and didn't know what the hell was going on.'</p> <p> What went on was a high-speed rescue which saw Ken and his throttle man taken ashore, shaken but not badly injured, while his boat, World Of Cars, sank to the bottom of the Oslofjord. It was a narrow escape. Did he ever consider not doing it again? He looks at me as if the question is ridiculous, a sparkle in his eye. He didn't, did he? 'No I didn't.' He likes the danger, doesn't he? 'Yes,' he says the sparkle brighter than ever. 'Someone told me I should take up golf.' Pause. 'I fucking hate golf.'</p> <p> Ken Thorne is a 59-year-old Welsh millionaire from Cardiff with a wife, four children and six grandchildren. His money comes from property development and car dealing but his passion is powerboating. When World Of Cars sank he lost roughly \u00a3300,000 - it wasn't insured - and the first thing he did was look for another ride. Andreas Ugland, another Norwegian businessman, badly injured his back in Oslo and was unable to drive his boat Jotun in Istanbul, so he offered the drive to Ken.</p> <p> Throughout the weekend Class One offers images of itself as a kind of wannabe Formula One and plenty of people would like to further the analogy. But as he sits in the shade of the Jotun team trailer the day before resuming his race career, it becomes clear that F1 doesn't boast anyone remotely as original as Ken Thorne. Everyone told me that he is mad, they love him but he's mad. With arms like hams and his pugnaciously playful manner Ken doesn't give a damn. He just loves being on the water and racing.</p> <p> The big issue in Class One is the Arabs or, to be more specific, the United Arab Emirates. Its leading boat, Victory One, has won three of the past four races and leads the championship by 24 points. With the UAE government prepared to bankroll the team to the tune of around \u00a39 million a season, approximately nine times as much as anyone else, the fear is that in trying to promote their country (powerboating is close to a national sport) the UAE is in danger of destroying the spectacle.</p> <p> Ken, for one, isn't impressed. 'They've ruined it,' he says. 'It's not their fault. The UIM [powerboating's governing body] have allowed it to happen. But the essence of competition is a level playing field, and we haven't got one. They have so much money that they are entering the field with a higher safety margin than anyone else. To compete we all have to go all out all the time. We're pushing too hard. That's what happened to me in Oslo.'</p> <p> Apart from their competitors, there is one other person in Istanbul disturbed by the dominance of Victory One. Just over a year ago Matthias Hauger bought into OSP, the company that promotes Class One. Hauger has a vision of the sport with more teams, more venues and lots more television coverage. That vision does not involve Victory One winning every race - though he doesn't quite put it like that.</p> <p> A 33-year-old former investment banker, Hauger was born in Germany but educated in Britain and has lived here ever since. He is dynamic and friendly, in a Thatcher's child sort of way. Just over a year ago he and his friend and sometime business partner Charles Koppel came to watch Class One and were impressed by the spectacle but not by the promotion. At that time (somewhat confusingly) OSP was owned by Gjelsten, but the Norwegian was keen to bring in new blood. Hauger and Koppel bought into OSP. (Even more confusingly they have also bought into Wimbledon.) Hauger and Koppel don't wish to mislead you as to their motives. 'It's totally a business venture,' says Hauger.</p> <p> The past 10 years have been a time of decline and confusion in Class One, following the sport's heyday in the Eighties when drivers such as former F1 favourite Didier Pironi and Stefano Casiraghi (husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco) raised its profile. The deaths of both in crashes - Pironi in 1987 at Poole and Casiraghi in 1990 in Monaco - played a major part in the sport's downturn. Though the use of fighter plane cockpits has made powerboating much safer, the return to public popularity is a slow process.</p> <p> Hauger sees television as vital. He and Koppel are involved in the production and are striving for a better product. More cameras, more angles. Already there has been progress with broadcast minutes (yes, they do count these things) rocketing from a total of 2,600 minutes around the world last year to more than 36,000, across 100 countries, this. The 2000 championship was thought to have been turned down by the BBC and C4 but gets a regular airing on Sky. Apart from TV, Hauger would like to see the courses closer to the shore, big screens to generate atmosphere and some new locations. This year there are races in Italy, Norway and Turkey (two apiece); and Germany and the UAE. Next year Hauger hopes to add Barcelona and Copenhagen and, perhaps, Britain. Cowes, or possibly Cardiff, have been mentioned. 'From a television and sponsorship perspective we clearly must have a UK venue.'</p> <p> Hauger is frequently described as an aspiring Bernie Ecclestone of powerboating. When I put it to him he looks at me quizzically. Which part of the description is he uncomfortable with: the reputation for ruthlessness, the desire for total control, the legendary wealth? 'I hope it doesn't take that long,' he says.</p> <p> It's Sunday morning, race day, and there is a buzz of anticipation down by the quayside. Well, either a buzz of anticipation or the sound of Class One's camp followers enjoying the early sun and a cup of coffee. There had been a time trial yesterday but the results count only for a separate championship and have no bearing on this afternoon's race. (For the record, Victory One strolled home, nearly two seconds ahead of Gjelsten's Spirit of Norway). Today it's for real. If anything the weather is even better than Saturday: a clear blue sky, brilliant sunshine and no wind. It will be fast.</p> <p> All the pre-race action is in the Tommy Hilfiger sponsorship stand. Rokke is there with his throttle man Jim Dyke. Gjelsten is there with his throttle man Steve Curtis. And the legendary Italian driver and playboy Edoardo Polli is there with his cigar, his throttle man obscured by a plume of smoke. ('Throttle man', incidentally, is a slightly misleading term, certainly if it suggests some sort of bag carrier. In fact throttle men are at least the equals of their drivers, who concentrate solely on steering, and some say it is the more skilful position.)</p> <p> The six are huddled furtively, presumably talking race tactics. Then again, perhaps Rokke and Gjelsten are plotting the takeover of Tommy Hilfiger. If this stand doesn't give away the sort of people attracted to Class One, then the Maserati one next door certainly does. It costs at least a quarter of a million dollars to put on a weekend of Class One and for that sort of money you don't expect to be hobnobbing with the great unwashed. From the sparkling, new pantechnicons which transport the boats from venue to venue, to the expensively coutured hangers-on, to the fleet of pristine scooters everyone uses to transport themselves the smallest of distances, to the boats themselves, the evidence of wealth is everywhere. Class One may be a poor relation to Formula One, but we're talking rich families here.</p> <p> It would be nice to be able to describe the paraphernalia of the powerboating circus as incongruous pitched against the ancient backdrop of Istanbul. In fact there is no paradox at all. Across the quay the villas in this part of town could be from the French Riviera and the boats moored on the opposite shore would do credit to St Tropez. Only when you look across the Bosphorus itself and watch the huge tankers and cargo ships humming slowly between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea do you get any sense of location.</p> <p> In truth the paradox is Istanbul itself: a city laden with historical resonance but more than willing to embrace the lifestyle and values of the 21st century. The satellite dishes sprouting from every rooftop suggest a place less than consumed by its past.</p> <p> Adding to the ambience of Mediterranean chic is Rokke's girlfriend, the spectacularly monikered Selina Middlefart. Her name isn't the only thing spectacular about Selina, a tall, beautifully sculpted blonde who - as if she didn't have enough going for her - is independently wealthy. Class One may not quite have the glamorous following of Formula One, but Selina is doing a pretty good job of redressing the balance.</p> <p> I home in on Rokke. 'I don't give interviews,' he says as he disappears into the Jolly Motor trailer. Clearly his reputation is well founded. To make amends the organisers invite me on to the starter's boat to watch the race from the middle. As someone whose sea legs have never been very reliable I'm not sure this is any sort of compensation, but in this macho environment I don't like to own up to them. It is, I'm told, a great honour.</p> <p>A couple of hours later I'm next to the starter, Richard Ridout, on board his powerboat. Richard is a tubby builder from Bournemouth with a wispy grey beard and an engaging manner. He looks like Richard Griffiths with a clipboard. He tells me I can help start the race by holding the yellow flag aloft until the off. Again I wonder whether this is expecting a bit much from someone with my sea legs. Again I remain silent. How difficult can it be to hold up a yellow flag? As we zoom around the course checking the buoys it turns out to be a lot more difficult than I thought. We are buffeted up and down, the wind raging into our faces. I need all my strength to keep the flag up, but I do get a sense of the speed and exhilaration of powerboats. We are doing all of 30mph.</p> <p> Half an hour later and the moment has arrived. All the boats have to stay within the line of sight of the starter, and behind his boat, until the yellow flag goes down and the green one is raised.In an instant the competitors blaze past us in a swirl of foam and deafening noise and at that precise moment I realise the essence of Class One powerboating. There is only one word for those boats. Monsters. </p> <p> As with many sports, television does not do them justice. Nor do photographs. They are huge. Simply huge. At 46 feet long, they are a good six feet longer than a London bus and more than three times the length of a Formula One car. Each one is powered by a couple of V12 engines that make a terrifying, elemental din. Bjorn Gjelsten may say it's not just a question of size, but in the world of phallic symbols they are most definitely at the hardcore end of the Freudian metaphor.</p> <p> Not only has the start been thrilling, it is also unexpected. Victory One is at the back and the two Norwegians are in the vanguard. By the end of the first lap Rokke's Jolly Motor is ahead, closely pursued by the second Emirates boat, Victory Seven, and Gjelsten in Spirit of Norway. At the end of the second lap, right in front of us, comes a mesmerising bit of racing as Spirit, having drawn level with Victory Seven, undercuts it at the top buoy with a superbly delicate manoeuvre. But before Gjeltsen can enjoy his advantage he inexplicably clobbers the second buoy at the top of the course, allowing Victory Seven back into second place. While confusion reigns on our boat (what are the rules when a buoy has been hit?) the two boats charge down the Bosphorus. The buoy, meanwhile, is nowhere to be seen.</p> <p> By the time the leaders come round again Spirit has retaken second place and the stage seems set for a memorable battle between the Norwegians. However there is a cloud on the horizon. Victory One. After a bad start the UAE boat is moving remorselessly up the field. By lap five it has overtaken Victory Seven to claim third place. One lap later it goes past Spirit into second and on lap seven it takes the lead from Jolly Motor. A few minutes later the Arabs achieve total domination when Victory Seven goes past both Norwegians.</p> <p> And that, quite simply, is that. Just over halfway through and the race is over. Victory One wins by a comfortable margin, its fourth in five races. Victory Seven comes second, Rokke third, Polli fourth and Gjelsten a very disappointing fifth. </p> <p> For a man who has a) just been beaten, and b) dislikes talking in public, Kjell Rokke seems remarkably happy at the post-race press conference. There were two races, he says, and he was happy to have done well in the one in which Victory One was not competing. He even admits to having made a mistake, one that had allowed Victory Seven to pass him. As the conference draws to a close it occurs to me why he's so happy. He may have been beaten by the UAE boats, but he finished ahead of Gjelsten and has overtaken him in the championship. He must be in a good mood because after the conference, amazingly, Rokke agrees to a brief interview. You and Bjorn have a friendship going back 30 years? 'Yeah.' But you beat him today? 'Yeah. We were a little bit more lucky than he was.' Clearly not one to brag, then. You have a long friendship, but you also compete against each other? 'No that isn't true.' Pardon? He says you compete against each other. 'No, I don't compete against him. I compete in the class, and Bjorn by virtue of being a competitor, I compete with him. But I don't compete with Bjorn. I don't think he competes with me either.'</p> <p> Very odd. What's wrong with admitting you and Bjorn compete? By now Rokke clearly wants to get away, but before he can, I ask him whether he would buy another team in the future. 'The reason I got out of it was that I had my own team and I was spending too much time doing it. Now I'm a hired driver for the Jolly Motor team, I get paid for it and I'm happy.' You get paid for it? Jesus, you're the richest man in Norway and it's important that you get paid for it?</p> <p>He shrugs and evades the question. 'Well it's a good team, it's a professional team. I have a job to do'</p> <p>Will he be back next year? He shrugs again. 'If I get hired back, that's the question.' A few minutes later I'm talking to Gjelsten. He is fuming, and wants to explain why he didn't do better in the race. 'We had a very good start, we were leading towards the first bend, which is very important, then we lost the gear,' he says. 'We had technical problems.'</p> <p> All the same he was furious with what had happened with Victory Seven and hitting the buoy. He had to hit it, he explains, to prevent a serious collision. 'I had a line like this,' he says drawing a diagram on my notepad, 'and then we came back like this. I was the first boat to this buoy, I had my nose in front of him. I saw that he was not going to back down, as he should do, because I had the racing line. So I had two options. Either to stay outside of the buoy and him probably hitting the backside of the boat or' His voice trails off. 'I felt very insecure being there and Steve - who's no chicken - said \"Hook it.\" He would have hit me somewhere. Guaranteed. He had his nose up, so I knew he couldn't steer.' The sense of injustice is palpable. Would he appeal?</p> <p> 'No.' Why not? 'I like to race, I don't like to protest.' What about racing Kjell, when they were first and second. Didn't he enjoy that? 'I enjoyed it, but we were frustrated because we should have been in the lead. We had the perfect start. We were first out. But for the technical problems I think we would have been second for sure.' You would have beaten Kjell? 'Yeah. It's fair to say. We were less than three-quarters of a lap behind them, having stopped two times. But that's racing.' And how about their rivalry overall. Who's better at what? 'Well we competed first at track and fields [cross-country]. We were about the same. And skiing, I took it to the national and international level' The unspoken inference was clearly that Rokke hadn't. 'And racing, I've been the world champion. There's never been a Norwegian world champion.' Anything else you two compete at? 'Oh absolutely.' Go on. 'Oh - they're secret.' Business? 'Well, there we usually work together. A lot of small things.' Kjell denies the rivalry, by the way. Bjorn Gjelsten smiles benevolently, a 'yes he would say that wouldn't he?' smile. I tell him that I don't think Rokke wants to tell me anything about himself. 'Well he wants you to stay away from me.'</p> <p>On the quayside that night there is a spectacular gala dinner for more than 400 guests. The atmosphere is relaxed and festive with a lot of the teams letting go after a hard weekend's racing. And everyone I talk to agrees that there is a special rivalry between Bjorn and Kjell, whatever Kjell may say.</p> <p> Most of the drivers are there. Edoardo, surrounded by pretty women, cigar firmly in place. Ken ebullient as ever. Bjorn more subdued, but happily going over his race again. Of Kjell there is no sign. He and Selina have made straight for the airport where they board his own 737 to fly back home. By the time the gala dinner finishes Kjell Inge Rokke is back in Oslo.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Nancy In The Morning</strong></p> <p>I open my eyes to the sound of my hometown, Nancy, in the morning: the 7.43am for Paris pulling out slowly from the station; the hum of exhaust pipes on the avenue de la Garenne; an ambulance klaxoning moronically in the distance; heavy drops of rain rapping the bedroom window and beyond the white net curtain, the first sight of Nancy, an eternal grey sky, always the same. </p> <p> Virginia is sleeping. I reach out and nudge her gently and watch her blink and stretch and slowly stir to life. No words are exchanged between us as she pulls on her dressing gown and trudges towards the door. I lie with my thoughts and listen to the sound of Maeva being woken and coaxed into the bathroom: 'Allez, Maeva, c'est l'heure, ma cherie.' I pull back the sheets and swivel my legs on to the floor. My knee, as usual, has seized during the night. I run my fingers across the joint and feel the bone and cartilage grinding like a rusty old gate. The first step of the day is always the most painful. First, I lift my heel off the floor and flex my leg gently. Then, placing my hands on the side of the bed for the launch, I push forward, taking the weight on my left leg and hold the post of the bed for support. By the time I have limped from the wardrobe to the bathroom to the kitchen, I am almost walking normally. Virginia hands me a cup of tea. Maeva has breakfasted and is ready for school.</p> <p> My name is Tony Cascarino and I am 37 years old. I live with Maeva Cascarino and Virginia Masson on the third floor of an apartment block, a short walk from Nancy train station at 6 avenue de la Garenne. Madame Ginet, a mild-mannered teacher who sometimes teaches me French, lives in the apartment above. Monsieur Madaous, a bad-tempered sales rep who almost always acts like a prick (whenever Maeva is loud or I absentmindedly obstruct his parking space), lives in the apartment below. It is not, by any means, an exclusive development. We buy our groceries from the Codec store around the corner, drop our rubbish on the ground floor in a bin behind the lift and collect our post from wooden boxes bearing our names in the entrance hall. Most of the tenants are office workers, secretaries or tradesmen - ordinary people living ordinary lives well, maybe mine is a little different. </p> <p> I play football with Nancy FC. I have been a professional footballer since 1982, when I walked off a building site in London one afternoon and signed for a third division team called Gillingham. Before working on the building site, I spent two years cutting and styling women's hair. Professional football is a lot more fun than building or hairdressing. It also pays better and carries a lot more perks: we travel first-class, stay in the best hotels, eat the finest food, wear designer clothes, drive the fastest cars and never have to queue for surgeons, doctors or dentists. The game is good to us. The game is everything you dream it is: we are worshipped like pop stars, pampered and spoiled. But after 19 years, it begins to wear you down. Of late the sheer boredom of playing and training has been killing me. </p> <p> Sometimes, on the night before a game, I lie on the five-star bed in the five-star hotel and gaze at the five-star ceiling and it feels like a prison cell. But I still get anxious when the manager names the team. I still get excited when Saturday comes. My daughter, Maeva, is five years old. When she throws her arms around me and calls me 'Papa', it is easily the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. She was born in Nice in August 1995 at a time when I was married to another woman, living in another place and leading a deceitful double life. A day old when I sneaked away and saw her for the first time, she was aware of me for the first year of her life as the father who slept with her mother but never stayed the night. </p> <p> L'\u00c9cole Maternel de Notre-Dame is a 10-minute drive from the apartment. We take the lift to the ground floor and skip quickly through the rain to the car, where our warm breath soon mists the windscreen. 'On peut rien voir,' Maeva protests, as we join the queue on Avenue de la Garenne. 'I know, Mimi,' I reply. 'I've switched on the fan to clear it.' 'Ca marche pas, papa.' 'It will clear in a moment, Mimi. Sit back and put on your seat belt.' 'D'accord.' D'accord is French for OK. Maeva knows d'accord is French for OK and knows the English for pretty much everything she says but refuses to converse with me in anything but French </p> <p> I find a vacant space near the school on Rue de la Ravinelle and lead Maeva by the hand to the entrance. Other parents are dropping children off; from the look in their eye as we exchange 'bonjours', it is clear to me that they know who I am. The recognition is flattering. Although I have never felt that comfortable in the spotlight, one of the real satisfactions of my life these days is when Maeva comes home from school glowing because her dad has been mentioned in class. They call me 'Tony Goal' in these parts, which will probably sound absurd if you happen to follow football and live in Birmingham, Glasgow or London. But it's true. Only six other players can boast a better strike rate this season in the French first division. My name will ring a bell in every village Caf\u00e9 des Sports. But it is also true that when it comes to much of what happened before, I can offer little by way of defence.</p> <p> Ten years ago, in what seems another life, I moved from Millwall to Aston Villa, at a time when Villa were top of the league and closing on the championship. Brilliant since the start of the season, the team had started to falter in March and I was bought to supply the goals that would stave off Liverpool. I didn't score for seven games. Liverpool were champions. Villa finished runners-up. A year later, I moved from Villa to Celtic but the drought continued. One afternoon, I was out shopping with my pregnant wife and my son Michael when a supporter stopped me in the street and offered a critical assessment. </p> <p> 'You're fucking shit, you,' he hissed. 'You're a useless big bastard.' Glasgow is the world capital of tribal hatred and friends had warned me not to react when approached by Rangers fans, but this fellow was absolutely raving. 'You're a fucking wanker, a useless bastard.' 'Look, mate,' I pleaded, 'give me a break. Can't you see I'm with my wife and son?' 'You're fucking shit,' he said. 'And I'm a Celtic fan.' We moved to London six months later but the cataclysm continued at Chelsea. I was booed at Stamford Bridge on the day I made my debut, and then Michael came home from school one afternoon and inflicted the cruellest blow of all. The boys in his class had been talking about me. 'You're not very good, Dad, are you?' he said. How do you respond to something like that? What do you say to your six-year-old son? That his friends are wrong? That there's a lot more to the game than what they hear from their dads? What's your defence when you're 31 years old and your career is in freefall? There was nothing to do but swallow hard and resolve to make him proud. </p> <p> Six years have passed since I left England's shores and whenever I return, people who remember me as the lanky striker who used to play for Gillingham often stop me in the street and ask what I'm doing now. Unfortunately, the French sports daily L'Equipe doesn't sell that well in Chislehurst; I might as well be scoring goals on Mars. Usually, I'll fob them off with some yarn about retirement. How do I begin to explain my secret life? There is so much they would never understand. </p> <p>It is October and Nancy is cold and sad and grey, and over the next five months it won't change much. Take away the magnificence of the Place Stanislas and Nancy doesn't have a lot going for it. The people are decent but struggle to make a living. If it were England, it would be Barnsley. Heading west towards the suburb of Laxou, I take the A31 towards the training ground at For\u00eat de Haye. The manager has announced a double session today. Double sessions are murder when it's cold and wet and you've got bombed cartilage for a knee. I've had two cortisone injections already this season. For the past eight years I've taken anti-inflammatory pills before and after every game. The pills play havoc with my stomach and scorch my arse with diarrhoea but when the ball hits the back of the net and the crowd chants my name, it seems a small price to pay. How much longer can I keep paying? I don't know. </p> <p> There isn't a week that goes by these days when I don't ask myself that question, knowing the answer will always be the same. I play football because I have to play football. I play football because I know nothing else. On the first Friday of every month, the incentive to keep going is dropped through my letterbox in printed type: allowances and bonuses, taxes and fines, all listed in francs and centimes. I earn 160,000 francs a month playing for Nancy, which, depending on bonuses, translates to roughly \u00a38,000 a month after tax. Pretty much everything we spend is budgeted for these days - a sharp contrast to my youth, when the only figures that mattered were the goal-scoring stats. But you change as you get older: you worry about the future more. Last week, after another night spent tossing and turning, I sat down with a pen and paper and tried to figure it all out.</p> <p>1982: Gillingham - \u00a39,200 <br> 1983: Gillingham - \u00a310,400<br> 1984: Gillingham - \u00a313,000 <br> 1985: Gillingham - \u00a313,000 <br> 1986: Gillingham - \u00a313,000 <br> 1987: Gillingham/Millwall - \u00a320,800 <br> 1988: Millwall - \u00a323,400 <br> 1989: Millwall - \u00a326,000 <br> 1990: Millwall/Aston Villa - \u00a356,000 <br> 1991: Aston Villa/Celtic - \u00a371,500<br> 1992: Celtic/Chelsea - \u00a378,000 <br> 1993: Chelsea - \u00a378,000 <br> 1994: Chelsea/Marseilles - \u00a3147,000 <br> 1995: Marseilles - \u00a3225,000 <br> 1996: Marseilles - \u00a3199,000<br> 1997: Nancy - \u00a3126,000<br> 1998: Nancy - \u00a398,400 <br> 1999: Nancy - \u00a3140,000 <br> Approximate income from football since 1982: \u00a31,347,700 <br> Bonus payments and sign-on fees since 1982: \u00a3967,000<br> Total career earnings since 1982: \u00a32,314,700 <br></p> <p> It was a sobering experience. Two point three million! Where the hell has it all gone? I mean, there are porters and plumbers and painters who win that on the Lottery and never have to work again. They buy a dream house and a dream car and take their holiday of a lifetime and never look back. They probably won't, it's fair to say, invest as heavily in their pension \u00a32,314,700 -\u00a3150,000 = \u00a32,164,700 and definitely won't, it's true to say, give 40 per cent away in tax \u00a32,164,700 -\u00a3870,040 = \u00a31,294,660 or get slapped with agents' fees \u00a31,294,660 -\u00a332,000 = \u00a31,262,660 They won't sign for Celtic and drop 35 grand in Birmingham because they bought just before the property crash \u00a31,262,660 -\u00a335,000 = \u00a31,227,660 but they may incur the unfortunate sting of divorce \u00a31,227,660 -\u00a3200,000 = \u00a31,027,660 with its maintenance payments that click like a taxi meter \u00a31,027,660 -\u00a324,000 = \u00a31,003,660 and school fees \u00a31,003,660 -\u00a318,000 = \u00a3985,660 not to mention the tip for the solicitors \u00a3985,660 -\u00a35,000 = \u00a3980,660 And when you add it all up, or rather take it all away, 900 grand is not a lot of jam when spread over what it costs to live for 18 years.</p> <p> And it certainly hasn't insured my happy-ever-afters. So you keep fighting the pain when you step out of bed each morning. And you keep taking the pills that rot your stomach and burn your arse. And you keep putting the dye in your hair and pretending you're 10 years younger. You survive. You do what you can. But on mornings like this when the rain is lashing the windscreen, it's hard. </p> <p> That Celtic fan who insulted me in Glasgow, the supporters at Stamford Bridge who derided me for fun - I wish they could have been there on the night I beat Juventus. I wish they could have heard the cheers of the most fanatical supporters in France. I wish they could have seen what I went on to. I swallowed hard. I turned it around. I tried to make Michael proud. Did I? Yes, I'd like to think I did. </p> <p> His mother, Sarah, is writing a novel at the moment. It's the story of a young woman who loves and loses and is forced to start again. The woman, who is also called Sarah, lives in a leafy suburb of London with her husband Eric and their two young sons. Eric is a professional footballer whose career is falling apart. Unwanted and unloved, he is on the verge of quitting the game when he is thrown a lifeline by a big club in France. They find a house in Aix-en-Provence and at first struggle to adapt but within months are embracing the joy of their new lives. For Eric, it's the discovery of what he knew he always had. For Sarah, it's the smell and feel of Provence and their new way of life. The boys settle, too, and seem happy at school. Sarah has never been as content. It's a new chapter. The chance to start again. And then, incredibly, it all falls apart </p> <p> It happens unexpectedly, on the evening of an international game in Dublin. Sarah has returned to London to spend a few days with her mum, when a friend, whose husband, like hers, also plays for the Republic of Ireland, suggests they take a late flight to Dublin to 'surprise the boys'. The game has ended when their flight from Gatwick touches down. They take a taxi to the team hotel and arrive to find their husbands celebrating with the manager and rest of the team in the bar. Eric seems pleased. He calls a porter and has her bags delivered to his room and suggests they go for a meal. They retire with their friends to the dining room. Sarah places her order and asks Eric for the key to the room. She enters the room and sits down to call her mum. There is nothing to worry about. Her precious boys are safely tucked in bed. She thanks her mum and swivels away from the desk, tipping over a small bin with her foot. A crumpled sheet of fax paper tumbles on to the carpet. She picks it up and is about to toss it back when curiosity tempts her to unravel it. The fax is from a woman. The woman is French. The woman is pregnant. The woman has just had a scan and is expecting a baby girl. Eric is about to become a father again. </p> <p> Shaking with rage, she storms back to the dining room and an embarrassing scene ensues. Eric pleads for calm and ushers his wife back to the room. Dismissing the affair as a brief encounter, he begs her forgiveness and promises never to see the other woman again. They return to France and after a few difficult weeks the relationship settles down and appears to return to normal. But behind Sarah's back, Eric continues to lie and cheat. One morning, after dropping the boys at school, she returns to find a note on the kitchen table. 'I'm sorry, Sarah. I know you will never understand but it was something I had to do. Eric.' She checks the bedroom: her husband has removed his clothes. She collapses on the bed in a flood of tears, shaking with grief and anger. The bastard! The cruel, spineless, swine! What is to become of them? Where will they live? How will she explain it to the boys? What breed of man uproots his family from everything they know and abandons them in a strange land? </p> <p> I'm not sure how the story ends or what Sarah intends to call the book when it's published. I'd like to think that, it being a work of fiction, any resemblance between its characters and real people is purely coincidental. I'd like to think that Michael will read it and never confuse Eric with his dad. I'd like to think he goes to school these days with the cuttings he gets from his nan and says 'Told you so' to his mates. I'd like to think he sleeps beneath my poster on his bedroom wall. I'd like to think he understands. But what I'd like to think and what I do think, are not the same.</p> <p><strong>Little Voice </strong></p> <p>(In November 1999 Cascarino was picked for the Republic of Ireland squad to play Turkey in a play-off for Euro 2000. By now a perennial substitute for the Republic Cascarino prepared for the game fully expecting his friend and room-mate Niall Quinn to be picked ahead of him.)</p> <p> The day runs smoothly until just before the pre-match meal, when I bump into Packie Bonner in the corridor. Packie, a friend and former team mate, is a member of the coaching staff. 'I don't think Niall is right,' he says, grimly. 'Get ready to play.' 'You're joking.' 'No, we've just had him down with Martin (the team doctor, Martin Walsh). They're talking about a painkiller before the game.' I continue on towards the dining room but feel the blood draining from my face. I think, 'Oh shit! I might be playing this game,' and within two seconds, the little voice is in my head </p> <p> 'You pathetic fucker, Cascarino!' </p> <p> 'What do you mean?' </p> <p> 'I heard what you thought.' </p> <p> 'No I'</p> <p> 'John from Mullingar was right, you're a fucking disgrace.'</p> <p> 'I didn't mean it like that. It just .slipped out.' </p> <p> 'The truth always does.' </p> <p> 'What truth?' </p> <p> 'You don't want to play.' </p> <p> 'Of course I want to play. I was out of bed at six the other morning to drive to Luxembourg; I'll be chewing anti-inflammatories for a week for this team! Why would I inflict that on myself if I didn't want to play?'</p> <p> 'Well, I can think of the \u00a3900 match fee for a start.' </p> <p> 'That's bollocks - it has nothing to do with the money.' 'Oh, so you don't need the money?' 'I didn't say that. I said it has nothing to do with money.'</p> <p> 'So what's your problem, then?' </p> <p> 'You wouldn't understand.'</p> <p> 'No, you're right, I wouldn't. In fact, I can't think of any self-respecting professional anywhere in the world who would think what you've just thought!' </p> <p> 'I didn't mean it like that Look Niall Quinn has been my direct rival on this team for the last 14 years and although he has been the preferred choice for most of that time, I never considered myself inferior to him and always believed I could do as good a job for Ireland until last year, when for the first time ever I travelled to Dublin hoping I'd be named as a sub.' </p> <p> 'Why?' </p> <p> 'I'd gone. I'd lost it. I'd started the season well with Nancy and was still training hard but the years had finally caught up with me and I didn't want to let anyone in Ireland down. Niall is four years younger than me and playing better than ever. I'm happy to stay involved but in a supporting role.' </p> <p> 'So, it looks like you're in trouble, then?' </p> <p> 'How do you mean?' </p> <p> 'His neck injury sounds serious.' </p> <p> 'Yeah, I can't believe it! He seemed fine this morning.' </p> <p> 'Well, maybe he will be OK.' </p> <p> 'I hope so.'</p> <p> 'And maybe you'll get on for the last 20 minutes.' </p> <p> 'Yeah, that would be great.' </p> <p> 'And miss a sitter to win the game.' </p> <p> 'Clear off! Give me a break.' </p> <p> Think positive? Not me. I think negative. I have always been a negative person. I have always thought negative thoughts. For as long as I can remember, there has been a little voice in my head that highlights my weaknesses and undermines my confidence. When it comes to the art of shooting oneself in the foot, I have always been world class. I think too much during the games. Most players analyse performance after a game; not me: I do it all the wrong way - I think about how I'm playing as I play. Three bad passes and I'm glancing at the touchline</p> <p> 'Your number's up, Tony.' </p> <p> 'No it's not.' </p> <p> 'One more pass like that and it will be.' </p> <p> I've scored and played brilliantly one week and gone out and been awful the next, purely because some negative thought has hijacked me. I've tried to change and purge the doubt but it has always been in there, always been part of me. It was Graham Taylor at Aston Villa who noticed it first. He didn't know me from Adam when he signed me from Millwall, but within a few weeks he had identified my weakness. 'I want you to see a sports psychologist,' he said, one morning after training. 'You should be much more confident about who you are and what you want to be. I can't believe you're so negative in your approach.' A few weeks later he was offered the England job and I never followed it up. Would 'therapy' have made a difference? Perhaps, but I was quite immature at the time and wouldn't have been prepared to open up. We all know what happens in the psychiatrist's chair. Tell me about your childhood. What sort of a man was your dad? Tell me about the voice and when you first heard it. The prodding and probing of the secret corners; the paring away of the layers until your vulnerability is exposed </p> <p><strong>Hair today </strong></p> <p> (The Republic draw the game 1-1 and the team travels to Turkey for the return.)</p> <p> I've been dyeing my hair for as long as I can remember and make a point of presenting myself as smartly as possible when negotiating a contract. You wouldn't believe the difference a dye makes. Present yourself to the chairman in your naturally greying state and you're asking for trouble: 'Oh no, I'm not sure about this one. I don't think we'll get a year out of him.' But add a bit of colour to your roots and the contract is in the bag: 'Look at him, he's in great nick, I can't believe he's 36! He must really look after himself.' It's just an illusion but the illusion works. In football, it's not what you are but what you appear to be that counts.</p> <p> The colour costs four million Turkish lira, which seems a staggering amount to spend on your hair. (It's only \u00a34). I return to the hotel and after breakfast, slip upstairs and lock the door to the room. At a critical juncture of the process, there is a frantic rattle on the door. 'Open up, Cas,' Dave Connolly says, 'We're starting a game of cards.' Colouring your hair is not a done thing in football; you can bleach it, or shave it, but the rest is taboo. 'Sorry, Dave, I'll be out in a minute,' I lie. 'I'm just having a bath.' But Niall, who has just shaken himself from his nightly coma, immediately blows my cover. 'He's not in the bath at all,' he laughs. 'He's colouring his hair!' Within seconds, the phone is buzzing and a queue has formed at the door - 'come out, you big poof!' The ribbing continues at training and for the rest of the afternoon - a childish but welcome diversion in the on-going battle to stay sane</p> <p><strong>Home truths </strong></p> <p> I was 12 years old when I discovered what it is to be afraid. It happened on a cold afternoon in December when I was walking home to 10 Garden Cottages with my best friend Chris McCarthy. Christmas was coming and for weeks we had been working on a plan to make money from our fellow pupils at St Joseph's Secondary School. First we had compiled a shopping list of the things they most wanted for Christmas. Then today we had taken the bus to Orpington and nicked what was required. It was a no-lose situation. By selling the order at seriously reduced prices we were guaranteed a nice little earner. Delighted with a job well done, we had stashed the loot into two large plastic bags and had just started the climb at the bottom of our road when we happened to bump into my parents. Not part of the plan. My heart skipped a beat and I decided to bluff it out. 'Hi, Mum. Hi, Dad. Where're you off to, then?' Mum smiled. My father - no great surprise - was his usual crusty self. 'What's in the bags?' he snapped. 'Er nothing.' I panicked. It wasn't very convincing. My father took one of the bags and opened it and, without saying a word, handed it to Mum. The punch came from nowhere and spun me across the path. Stunned, I tried to find my bearings and catch a breath but everything was moving. A neighbour, Mr Choules, was staring across from his driveway in disbelief. Still shaking, I struggled to my feet and he hit me again. He thumped me as a man would thump another man. He booted and bombed me with every ounce of his strength for a hundred yards until we reached our house. Mum was pleading with him to stop but the battery didn't end until I reached my bedroom. Mum was worried that I was seriously hurt and sat with me for hours.</p> <p> I had lumps and bruises everywhere and ached all over as I lay on the bed but more acute than the pain was the stinging sensation of damp between my legs: I had wet myself We choose our friends, not our family. I never chose my Dad. My first tangible memory of him was a severe smacking when I was six or seven years old. I'm not sure what I did to deserve it, but then it never took much. My father was a crusty man with a volatile temper and he was almost always in a bad mood. As a boy, I didn't understand what bad moods were, but the knack of bringing out the worst in him seemed to come naturally. From the day I was born there seemed to be a chasm between us that widened the closer I became to my mother. I adored my mother and followed her constantly around the house as a boy but would never sit alone in the same room as a father who never hugged or kissed or showed me any affection. He wanted me to be like Mandy, spirited and fiery and confrontational, to be an Italian, a true Cascarino; but I just didn't have the testosterone. I was timid and docile and more an O'Malley by nature. A dreaded mummy's boy. </p> <p> When I was nine, he came to watch me playing football at school one afternoon. We were hammered 7-2 and he did nothing but shout at me all through the game. It was miserable. I could see all the other parents looking at him and towards the end I completely lost it and told him to give me a break. He brought me home and gave me a beating. He swore he would never come to watch me again and as ever was as good as his word. The experience left me physically and mentally scarred. The bruises quickly healed but the emotional wounds lingered. I performed poorly in school and generally lacked confidence. I wet the bed until I was 14 years old. The eruptions continued through my teenage years. I had a habit of lying on the carpet in front of the fire that used to really get up his nose. Incensed that I was 'blocking the heat for everyone else', he'd lash out with his boot and kick me in the back. One night, a few months after my seventeenth birthday, he did it for the last time. I'd spent the day labouring on a building site and had collapsed on the carpet in front of the TV. My father had also had a hard day and returned home even later. </p> <p> 'Get your arse away from the fire,' he roared. 'No, I'm not getting up,' I replied, instinctively. It wasn't planned. The words had already left my mouth when I realised I'd rebelled. I closed my eyes and braced myself for the inevitable. Nothing if not consistent, he jumped off the sofa and hoofed me in the ribs: 'I'm not going to tell you again, get your arse away from the fire.' Gasping as the air was toe-poked from my lungs, I coughed and spluttered and decided to hold my ground: 'No, not this time.' Enraged, he picked up a glass and flung it across the room. It shattered and stuck in my hand as I lifted my arm to protect myself. </p> <p> It would be easy to describe what happened next as that classic scene from the movies where the coward of the county breaks and shows the world he's a real man by unleashing 17 years of pent-up fury on the bastard who has cruelly abused him. But it wasn't like that. It wasn't like that at all. With blood gushing from my hand, I crossed the room to face him. We stood eye to eye and without saying a word, both understood he would never hit me again. And it was strange, but I felt no sense of joy or elation when it was over and the moment had passed. Just a sadness I couldn't fathom. </p> <p>Click <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/osm/story/0,6903,391030,00.html\"> here</a> to read part 2.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Shared pleasures</strong></p> <p>After six months of life as a professional, it was aspects of the life I had never considered that surprised me most. Before signing for Gillingham I had never, for example, roomed with another man. I had played with other men and showered with other men and dined with other men and sipped with other men and fought with other men, but I'd never actually shared a room with another man. I had shared a room with women, and shared a bed with women, and enjoyed every moment of it, but the act of sharing with another man, of breathing the same air and peeing in the same bowl and washing in the same basin and talking on the same telephone and watching the same TV and sleeping under the same ceiling with another man, a complete stranger, sometimes in the bed alongside was an alien experience. And one that took a lot of getting used to. </p> <p> Put yourselves in my shoes for a moment: you're 19 years old, have just signed for Gillingham Football Club and are about to discover the strange new world of playing away from home. You drive to Carlisle or Lincoln or Huddersfield on the eve of the game and step from the coach into the lobby of the team hotel where the physio has pinned beside the lift a list with all the rooms. You examine the list and discover you've been paired with Q, a first team regular you've trained with, but hardly spoken to before. Dinner is served in a function room downstairs. You sit listening to the banter around the table, then retire to the room to watch whatever Q fancies on TV before drifting off to sleep Before Q drifts off, that is. You, unfortunately, have always been a light sleeper and with every sense heightened, just the gentle whisper of his breathing is enough to keep you awake. And then he farts and begins to snore and you know the night will be long. You toss and turn into the early hours until the frustration finally exhausts you. When morning comes and you open your eyes, Q is staring at the ceiling with his finger up his nose and a wigwam in his bed. </p> <p> 'Morning Tone, sleep well?' he enquires, completely unabashed. </p> <p>'Yeah, great thanks, Q,' you lie. </p> <p>He casts off the sheets and walks bollock naked to the bathroom, defiantly parading his veiny sausage to the tune of Abba's 'Voulez-vous'. You shake your head in disbelief: 'This is the pits!' You've never seen an aroused penis before, except, obviously, your own. After a long and laborious pee that considerably lowers his mast, Q exits the bathroom, yawning and scratching his nuts, and makes for the bowl of fruit on the bedside table, unaware and unconcerned that two pubic hairs have dropped into the grapes. </p> <p>'Would you like some fruit?' he offers, extending the bowl.</p> <p>'No thanks,' you decline. </p> <p>Why, you wonder, didn't they warn you about this in Shoot?</p> <p>The real problem with sharing a room is that you never know who you are going to be lumbered with. As in the film Planes, Trains and Automobiles, there's always another nutcase waiting around the corner but after 18 years of smelly bastards, tight gits, sleepers, alcoholics, comedians, insomniacs, depressives, faithful husbands and serial adulterers, I can safely say I've had, and mostly enjoyed, them all. Rooming with Andy Townsend and Niall Quinn always reminded me of married life </p> <p>'You put the tea on, love, I'll get the biscuits.'</p> <p>'You sleep in that bed, love, I'll sleep in this one.' </p> <p>Throw your bag in the wrong place or leave a razor blade in the bath and you were always sure of a bollocking. Andy controlled the TV remote for the best part of 10 years! Niall used to nag me more than my wife. Bernie Slaven, another great character from my Ireland years, used to call his dog every night. I'd be sitting in the bed alongside and Bernie would be howling like Lassie into the phone 'Woof, woof, aru, aru, woof!' He'd be kissing the receiver and lavishing affection - 'Hello, lovey dovey' - on a dog! The first time it happened, I nearly wet myself and told him he was completely mad. Bernie, being Bernie, just laughed. </p> <p><strong>French correction</strong></p> <p> (In 1994, having been routinely derided by the fans of Celtic and Chelsea, Cascarino joined Olympique Marseille, the biggest club in France. OM had just been relegated to the Second Division after the match-fixing scandal surrounding club president Bernard Tapie. They signed Cascarino because they were banned from making transfers and he was available on a free.)</p> <p> Although Marc Bourier was officially the team manager, Bernard Tapie did all the talking before the game and toured the dressing room slapping us on the back and lunging at us with grunts and hoisted testicles. 'The demotion to the second division,' he announced, 'was a crushing blow for everyone in Marseilles, but it was also an opportunity to montrer les couilles (to show we had balls).' But when the game kicked off we had the worst possible start and conceded a goal after just two minutes. </p> <p>Urged forward by chants of 'Allez OM', for the next 20 minutes we battled for an equaliser until Marc Libbra was felled in the box and awarded a penalty. As Jean-Marc Ferreri, the team's designated penalty kicker, walked towards the ball and scooped it into his hands, I'm not sure what came over me but suddenly I was standing beside him. 'This is mine,' I said, seizing the ball from his hands. I walked forward and placed it on the spot. </p> <p>'What the fuck are you doing, Cass?'</p> <p>'I'm having it. This is mine.' </p> <p>'Whaaat? Are you out of your fucking mind? </p> <p>'No, it's the perfect opportunity to make a positive start.'</p> <p>'Oh yeah? What if you miss? Thought about that? Take a look at that bloke with no shirt behind the goal. Listen to those headbangers he's winding up! They make the mob from the Shed look like sheep. You'll be crucified if you miss.' </p> <p>'I don't care.'</p> <p>'What do you mean, you don't care? For fuck's sake, Cass, what are you saying? Look, you're taking this \"proud to be Marseillais\" bollocks too far. You'll be grabbing your nuts next! Dipping croissants in your coffee! Kissing your team mates before training! Saying ooh la fucking la! You're not Marseillais! You're from St Paul's Cray remember? You're the boy who pissed in his pants, the big clumsy bastard who used to hide at Celtic and Chelsea! Have you forgotten Neville Southall and the groans of the crowd?' </p> <p>'Things are going to be different here.'</p> <p>'Yeah? Don't make me laugh!'</p> <p>'No, I'm serious, it's shit or bust from now on. I'm going to think like a selfish bastard; I'm going to shoot every time I get a sniff at goal; I'm going to think and play uniquely for myself. I'm going to show them back in England. I'm going to shove it up their arse!'</p> <p>I smashed it by the keeper into the back of the net. A week later, we travelled to Brittany for our second game of the season at Saint Brieuc. It was a tough, physical encounter that looked set to end in stalemate until six minutes to go, when we were awarded another penalty. Unopposed on this occasion, I smashed it by the keeper again for my second goal of the season. Our third game was away to Nancy and after 15 minutes, I put us in front with a screaming volley that found the top corner of the net from 25 yards. Growing in confidence with every game, I made it four from four with the winner against Ales and five from five to earn a draw at Guingamp. Our sixth game of the season was a friendly at home to Juventus. Tapie was like a lunatic in the dressing room. The game was being transmitted live on Eurosport and because Juventus were Juventus and Marseilles were an ageing, makeshift, second-division team, he was afraid we were going to get tanked. I wasn't. I wasn't afraid of anything. Sent out to face the German international Jurgen Kohler, I ran him ragged and scored both goals in our 2-0 win. Kohler shook my hand when the game was over. Four months earlier, we had played against each other in a friendly international in Hamburg. 'You're not the same guy I played last time,' he smiled, as we walked towards the tunnel. How right he was. I was fitter, faster and stronger. I was three quarters of a stone lighter. I was confident. I believed. I was fier d'\u00eatre Marseillais. </p> <p><strong>The territory of lies</strong></p> <p> I did not want my marriage to fail. I know too much about failure. I had watched my parents' marriage fail, had failed for long periods of my football career and was determined to stick it out rather than fail again. By the summer of '94, our marriage certainly wasn't succeeding; I was cheating on Sarah at every opportunity; we had argued bitterly at the World Cup; and the only thing uniting our families was mutual contempt. The move to Marseilles had come at just the right time. It was a chance to clean the slate, to start again. </p> <p> A week after my meeting with Tapie, Sarah arrived with the boys. We stayed at the Palm Beach Hotel until the Thursday before the opening game of the season, when we decided to take a trip to Cannes to meet Andy Townsend and his wife, Jackie, who had just arrived on a week's holiday. They checked in for a night in a fancy hotel on the Boulevard de la Croissette, and after securing a babysitter to watch the boys, we booked a table for four in a brasserie beside the hotel. </p> <p> It was one of those classic, balmy, summer nights when it feels good to be alive. Sarah and Jackie have always got on well and as Andy and I had not seen each other since the end of the World Cup, there was loads to gossip about. At midnight, after a really nice meal, Sarah suggested we move on to a nightclub. </p> <p>'I can't stay out,' I said, 'I've got a game on Saturday.'</p> <p>Sarah was disappointed. She had switched into party girl mode and when Sarah was in party girl mode she ignored all the red lights. </p> <p>Andy tried to be as diplomatic as possible. 'Come on, be fair, Sarah. He can't! It's his first big game! It's important he makes a good start!' </p> <p>Sarah wasn't having it. She kept pegging away 'It's got nothing to do with the game' kept pushing out the envelope 'It's always the bloody same.' further and further 'He's just a boring bastard.' and she had gone over the edge. </p> <p> I had been called worse things in my time, but none had ever hurt as much or popped as big a fuse in my head. I thought I was going to explode. Andy and Jackie, who had been circling the table like firefighters, were running out of water to douse the flames. We paid the bill and stepped outside and I walked on ahead with Andy towards the hotel. A cool sea breeze was blowing gently across the boulevard but it wasn't cool enough: 'I could fucking kill her,' I spat. 'Calm down,' he urged. 'She's just had a few drinks. Just go to bed and forget about it.' There was no chance of that. I was walking quicker now. I couldn't wait to get back to the room, close the door and shut out the world so it was just me and her. Alone. </p> <p> 'You fucking bastard.'</p> <p>'You fucking cow.'</p> <p>'You're fucking loathsome.' </p> <p>'I fucking hate you.'</p> <p>I'm not sure how long we had been screaming when Michael poked his head through the door. And can't really explain why his frightened little face didn't bring us to our knees. It's just the way rage envelopes you, I suppose; short-circuiting your brain, numbing your senses, taking control so that nothing else matters. And in the early hours of that summer morning in Cannes, nothing else - not Michael's living nightmare, not my first game for Marseille, not anything in the world - mattered but retribution from Sarah, making the bitch pay. </p> <p>'I didn't have a job three weeks ago!' I fumed. 'I've been training my bollocks off, trying to secure a fucking future for us all, but all that interests you is having fucking fun!'</p> <p>I reached out and shoved her on to the bed. She bounced straight back and fronted me again. She was like a pit bull; she kept biting back: 'Don't you touch me, you boring fucking bastard!' I wanted to kill her. I wanted to drive my fist into the middle of her face. The rage began to scare me. I actually did want to kill her. I actually did want to punch her, as I had once been punched. Is this what happens when you grow up with violence? I made a conscious effort to calm down. What on earth was happening to me? I took a sheet and pillow to the bathroom and decided to make a bed.</p> <p> A few hours later, we breakfasted together and it was as if nothing had ever happened. </p> <p>'Morning,' she chirped. 'All right? Funny last night, wasn't it?' </p> <p>It was typical Sarah. She genuinely didn't believe we had a problem, was fully prepared to carry on as if nothing had been said. I wasn't. My sense of humour had gone. I had been doing a lot of thinking in the bath. </p> <p>'I'm going to leave you, Sarah,' I said.</p> <p>'Shaaat-up,' she said. 'It was nothing.'</p> <p>But I was never as sure of anything in my life.</p> <p>[Soon after this row Cascarino began an affair with Virginie Masson (Virginia) then a 20-year-old law student. She became pregnant, but the situation became messily complicated with Cascarino remaining with his wife and two sons when Virginia gave birth to their daughter. From then the situation just got worse.]</p> <p> Virginia moved back to her apartment in Marseilles. Her mother stayed for a while but it didn't take long before the reality of single motherhood began to bite. The next few months were a lonely and depressing time. I continued to visit regularly but they were only ever visits and not nearly as exciting as before. There were no romantic dinners or nipping around for a quickie: just tears and fatigue and nappies caked in shite. Our relationship began to come under strain and had deteriorated so much by Christmas that I was actually getting on better with my wife. I wanted to be with Virginia but couldn't leave Sarah and the boys. And for months it continued until the summer of '96, when Virginia finally decided she had taken enough. She was leaving for Normandy to spend some time with her father. There would be no more lies.</p> <p> My mother remarried on Saturday, 8 June. I phoned Virginia from the reception but for the first time since we had met, two years earlier, she was refusing to answer my calls. The following morning, I jumped into a car and disappeared for five days until Thursday evening, when I called Sarah. </p> <p> 'What have you been doing? Why didn't you call? I've been worrying about you for days!' </p> <p>'I'm in Normandy,' I said. 'I've been with Virginia and Maeva all week. I couldn't call for the obvious reason that I didn't want to upset you.'</p> <p> We arranged to meet in Marseilles on Sunday. There was an initial heated argument and then things calmed for a few days, when we talked it through again and she asked me what I wanted to do. I wanted to leave. I wanted to take a chance with Virginia but I didn't have the courage to say it to her face. And I couldn't bear to leave the boys with an image of their dad walking out of the door with his bags. So I told her I was confused and needed a day to work it out, and she obliged the next morning and took the kids out of the house.</p> <p>'See you later, Tony.'</p> <p>'Bye, Dad.'</p> <p>I waited 30 minutes before packing a sports bag with some clothes, then sat down at the kitchen table to write a note. </p> <p>Sarah, I'm sorry. It's something I had to do. I know you will never understand. Tony.</p> <p>If there is one day I could change, one day I could retrieve and rewrite, it is that one. Sarah deserved better. It was a spineless way to go.</p> <p><strong>Full Time</strong></p> <p> [After two and a half years at OM Cascarino moved to a smaller French club, Nancy.]</p> <p> Nancy has been good for us. Better than we ever imagined. When we first arrived, a lot of supporters were sceptical, believing that I had just signed for the money and would just sit out my time, but I scored a hat-trick - my first in Division One - in my second game and played so well for the remainder of the season that Gili was hammered in Marseilles for letting me go. For the last two seasons, I have continued to give my best for the club and tonight, in recognition, I was awarded the Medaille D'Or - the highest honour the city can bestow - at a champagne reception in the city hall. It was lovely. Virginia's family are from Nancy and it was a great honour to join a list of previous recipients that included the city's favourite son, Michel Platini. All the team were present: I was showered with tributes from every angle and was so overcome that I almost lost it in my acceptance speech, when I announced that 'the perfect ending for me would be to score the goals on Saturday that kept Nancy in Division One'. I'm not sure that Jacques Rousselot, the club president was listening. At the end of the evening, he asked me to rip up my contract and stay for another season. I thanked him for the offer but refused.</p> <p> The contract to which he was referring is the one I signed committing me next season to Red Star, a third division team in Paris. OK. I know. How can a 37-year-old pro who has made 88 appearances for his country, played in two World Cups and spent the last 16 chapters moaning about the state of his knee, how much he misses his boys and how badly he wants to quit even consider another year? Never mind another year at a club where the average gate is 600 people! Fear is how. Desperation is how. Money is how. What other job was going to pay me as well? What else was I qualified to do? </p> <p><strong>Postscript</strong></p> <p>On 19 August 2000, Tony Cascarino terminated his contract with Red Star and announced his retirement after being substituted in only his second game of the season: 'The team were an absolute disaster.' A week later, Nancy made him an offer to return. He refused.</p>",
  "<p>Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson arrived in England for an early-morning press conference and the red-carpet treatment last week. For a product of Sweden, a country biliously characterised by the Daily Mail as a nation of skiers and hammer throwers who spend half their lives in darkness, he taught the English a few things about the straight, defensive blocking shot. </p> <p>England's new manager spent his first hour in the job knocking back the probing questions and leaving the wider deliveries alone. He breezed through that first encounter with English journalists, who ranged from the supportive and inquisitive to the downright abusive, telling them, 'I'll talk about England the day I start work.' But when will that day be? It could be months before his first opportunity to make an impression on the players. Honeymoon period? There may not be one and, as one commentator drily observed, there can be no honeymoon until Eriksson and England are wedded. So Eriksson's guard is up and he is staying on the defensive. </p> <p>'In Italy, the press are more interested in my technique and tactics as a football trainer than is apparent in the English press,' he told Swedish journalists yesterday. 'There the interest is in my private life. They have already tried to contact my girlfriend Nancy Dall'Olio and tried to visit my son Johan in America; my brother Lars and his wife Agnetha in Portugal; my father and my mother in Torsby and my ex-wife Ann-Christine in Florence. I have not seen Ann-Christine for five or six years so what they might expect she would have to say is something of a mystery. It leaves me with a nasty feeling in the pit of my stomach.' </p> <p>And the real fun has not even begun. If Eriksson struggles to win on the pitch and win over the critics off it, the glare of the media spotlight will burn hotter than the southern European sun Eriksson has become accustomed to in recent years. Even in Rome, in charge of Lazio, he has struggled at times with the Italian press. </p> <p>'The journalists can be really nasty in Italy. I spent three years with Roma and three with Lazio and one of them criticised me at every possible opportunity and coined the expression \"Eriksson is a successful loser\", which other papers picked up. So it was a small revenge for me after Lazio won the Scudetto (league title) earlier this year and he went down on his knees and begged me to forgive him,' Eriksson said. </p> <p>Now all he has to do is convince those doubters in the English pack, especially those who, like the Daily Mail, continue to hold a torch for Terry Venables and who predictably railed against the Dagenham cheeky chappie's latest snub last week. </p> <p>But not for Eriksson the Venables way of schmoozing with the media. He does not indulge in football analysis on TV. He will co-operate with the media; answer their questions and drop the odd quip. Much more is not readily on offer. </p> <p>Indeed recently in Italy a media blackout was imposed at Lazio. Not by Eriksson but by president Sergio Cragnotti, angered by what was perceived as exaggerated reports on racial abuse aimed at Arsenal players during the recent Champions League game in Rome. There can be no such defensive mechanism used by the FA and their coach once both move into their new HQ in Soho Square. </p> <p>But those close to Eriksson say he has the toughness and ability to deal with adversaries. </p> <p>That applies to players, too. Clearly there was concern at basic failings in the Kevin Keegan regime even before the revelations about England's gambling culture which surfaced in the last few days. That Eriksson will stamp out such activity has already been made clear. What might surprise some of the England players is the severity with which the Swede can act. </p> <p>'He can be as hard as nails,' one of his former Sampdoria players said. 'He is mild mannered but firm, but you couldn't describe him as a man's man in the English sense. He doesn't go in for hard drinking and I have never seen him drunk or out of control. He is as straight as they come and won't stand for anything that might cause disharmony or disunity in his squads.' </p> <p>Bryan King, the former Coventry and Millwall goalkeeper, has known Eriksson since the mid-Eighties and has worked and scouted for him. He said: 'Sven-G\u00f6ran is a hands-on coach and the England players will know who is the boss. He will run the show - although he will have a team of top coaches around him. He'll talk and eat with the players but he won't socialise with them. There will be a clear divide. </p> <p>'When I was manager of Falkenberg in Norway in the early Nineties he brought Benfica to us for two weeks and I saw him close-up. He is very impressive; very clear, very methodical. He's hot on punctuality and won't suffer fools gladly. Remember he's been dealing with some of Europe's top players for almost two decades. Even in the early Nineties, he demanded the right diet for his team, the right food and drink. At the time, it would have brought an outcry from English players. Now they'll be more accepting.' </p> <p>Last Thursday, the only question to get past his guard was one about his international ambitions. Would he consider being manager of Brazil? 'Maybe only Brazil,' he said. 'It is a big, big job to be manager of England, Brazil might be the only team to compete.' There's something the FA has never had to worry about before. England have lost managers in a variety of ways down the years, even some of their successful ones, but the possibility of their top man being head-hunted from Rio is new. </p> <p>His guard was less disciplined at home in Sweden where he was asked about taking over England at a time when the national side was troubled. And what about managing his own country? Eriksson replied: 'Results over the last few years have proved that the Swedes are better than the English but in prestige terms, the England job is fantastic. I certainly do not think English football is bad. Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Leeds have all acquitted themselves well in Europe and the under-21 side has been functioning very well, so I see a bright future for English football and the national team.' </p> <p>So will Eriksson be given a fair chance by some of his fiercer critics, in and out of the press? An early guess is that, just as Arsenal discovered with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, insular prejudice soon evaporates if results improve. There is every chance of that happening, since Eriksson's coaching credentials are impeccable and he will be starting from such a low base. </p> <p>'It was important to look for someone who is an extraordinarily good coach,' said Adam Crozier, the FA's chief executive, stating the obvious while tacitly admitting Keegan had been a spectacularly bad choice. </p> <p>Eriksson might never have been a coach at all had he not been such an unspectacular player. He admits to having been slightly taken aback when, at the age of 27, his mentor Tord Grip - now scouting for the FA as Eriksson's assistant - told him to quit playing. </p> <p>'He has never said it but I know Grip didn't rate me as a player,' Eriksson said earlier this year. 'I am sure that when he saw me on the pitch for the first time, after I had just joined Karlskoga, he thought, \"Where on earth did this bloke come from and why have we wasted \u00a3500 on him?\" But the decision to stop playing and become a coach was one of the best decisions of my life and I have Tord to thank for that.' </p> <p>The num of the issue, at least for the Daily Mail, Gordon Taylor, John Barnwell and the others who have been giving Blimpish soundbites all week, is whether that coaching career should have landed him a job in charge of England. Surely, they argued, there must be an Englishman who could and should have been offered the job ahead of Eriksson. But no, there isn't. </p> <p>Eriksson's CV is ample proof to back Crozier's assertion that the FA have landed one of the world's top coaches. At the moment, as opposed to where he was nearly five years ago when the FA first sounded him out, Eriksson is exactly that. </p> <p>Shrewd enough to realise in 1996 that he was not yet experienced enough for international management (although the FA never formalised their offer and opted for Glenn Hoddle to replace Venables), and astute enough to leave the door open for an offer from Lazio even while he was signing a contract with Blackburn Rovers, the Swede has his detractors in Italy but possesses a record which puts even Wenger's in the shade. </p> <p>The FA's really lucky break, and this is possibly why they were looking abroad in the first place, was in finding such a well-qualified coach who regarded managing England as an honour and a privilege. Eriksson has been a fan of English football for as long as he can remember, citing Manchester United's 1968 European Cup victory as one of his earliest memories, and as a young coach spent time observing the methods of Bobby Robson and Don Howe. </p> <p>'He came to England and sat in on training sessions at Ipswich and Arsenal,' King recalled. 'I remember how happy he was in 1991 when his Benfica side beat Arsenal 3-1 in extra time in the European Cup. It meant so much to him. Now, he has tremendous regard for players like David Beckham and Michael Owen, and truly believes he is ready for this job.' </p> <p>David Dein - one of the two-man raiding party who took Eriksson from Lazio (Crozier was the other) is sure they have got it right this time. 'Sven will bring a refreshing dimension to the England team, by way of tactics, organisation and training methods,' he said. Dein, the Arsenal vice-chairman, should know, having seen the prototype at Highbury. </p> <p>What of the churlish anti-foreigner reaction by many last week? Gordon Taylor could perhaps be excused his peevish comments about betrayal of England's heritage, but his suggestion that Eriksson could not be trusted to turn up, or would change his mind at the first bad result, was unworthy of a fellow professional. Particularly as Eriksson has practically made a career of overcoming initial hostility. </p> <p>In his early days at Gothenburg, fans implored the club to 'send him back to the woods'. His arrival as Benfica's first foreign coach prompted 18 club directors to resign in protest, and Lazio fans threatened to trash 'his beautiful Volvo' after he sold Beppe Signori. </p> <p>He only narrowly survived his first coaching appointment, at Degerfors, after complaining to his chairman that the players were spending too much time and money in the bar after matches. The chairman, who had been at the club for 30 years, told Eriksson: 'If you take care of the football, I'll care care of the women and the booze.' Eriksson didn't argue - but he would certainly do so now. </p> <p>Friends in Italy have noticed a significant change in Eriksson in recent years; while he can be a hard man when he needs to be, he has also become very aware of his public image, particularly since his relationship with 36-year-old fianc\u00e9e Nancy Dall'Olio blossomed. </p> <p>'His hairstyle has changed, his clothes have changed, even his spectacles have changed,' said one of his Lazio players. 'He is very much more aware of style now.' But not at the expense of substance. </p> <p>Crozier, a man with a keen eye for image himself, is keen to accentuate the positive and look forward. 'A clean start should prove to be a good thing. 1966 was wonderful, but we have done nothing since then, got nowhere. We are not in the frame of countries that can win tournaments, and that is where we want to be.' </p> <p>Quite, except some people are already arguing that any such victory, as distant a prospect as it might appear at present, would be tainted by foreign involvement. These people hold up France as an example of how to run things, forgetting that the French once had a foreign coach, and appear to include Jack Charlton, that famous Irishman. The assumption is that England are cheating, or seeking to cover up their deficiencies by looking abroad, when in fact the opposite is true. The FA has bravely accepted that it needs help. </p> <p>'It's about looking forward rather than back,' Crozier said. 'There comes a time when you have been trying something for a long time when you have to accept it is not working. It's a time for courage.' </p> <p>Amen to that. English football can learn from Eriksson and with one single but serious reservation both should be good for each other. That reservation concerns the England fans, or at least the percentage of them who do not mirror their new coach in being urbane, stylish and softly-spoken. </p> <p>How the notoriously xenophobic element among England's following will take to a foreign coach is, frankly, a worry. An even bigger one is how the civilised Eriksson will take to the primitives in his new public. </p> <p>It is sad to have to insert this caveat into what should be a brave new England dawn, but for all the wrong reasons Gordon Taylor might have got something right. </p> <p> Tears before bedtime cannot be ruled out.</p>",
  "<p>I began supporting Portsmouth in 1965 when my uncle gave me a season ticket to Fratton Park; I think it cost \u00a313. The ground seemed marvellous and the pitch very lush, but in the past 35 years it has really declined. That terribly distorted nostalgia of memory makes it tempting to say how great things were, but that isn't true. Portsmouth weren't very good then, as they aren't today.</p> <p>It's amazing the extent to which a football team can occupy someone's life, and the degree of despair and absorption involved. People will spend longer analysing a team's performance than a book or film. As football fans we allow ourselves to dwell on a lot of details of how the team has played. Everyone is the same. It's a remarkable phenomenon.</p> <p>In the mornings the first thing I do after a shower is look at my emails to see what's arrived overnight. My partners are in Los Angeles but the first correspondence I look at is any emails from a group called the Portsmouth Anoraks, who run a website giving regular updates of news to do with the club. When I was shooting The English Patient in the Sahara, I used to get the Portsmouth Football Mail Fed-Exed to me every week, and I also had it sent out to Italy when we were making The Talented Mr Ripley.</p> <p>I have misgivings about being seen as a professional Portsmouth supporter. But when the club was in financial dire straits last year, I got involved with a group of supporters who wanted to run the club in the way that Bournemouth fans run theirs. I went to a fans' rally at the Portsmouth Guildhall and did interviews stressing the value of a football club like Portsmouth in the local community. The visibility of doing that was disconcerting; I like going to Fratton Park and being anonymous.</p> <p>Nick Hornby lassoed something all real football supporters know: that a lot of it is to do with your family and personal history. In the Sixties I went with my dad, uncle and cousins. It's the same today, except that my son Max now comes. Going to Fratton Park has been a compass over the years, and it's still an undiluted pleasure. But because we don't have a winning team, the result of the game is secondary to the pleasure of us all meeting up.</p> <p>Given their catchment area, Portsmouth could be sustained as a Premiership club. Our great rivals Southampton aren't greatly different to us; they've stayed in the top flight by having better players and better managers. A good start for us would be to stop selling our best players, like we did with Darren Anderton and Neil Webb. On the Portsmouth Anoraks website you aren't allowed to say 'Southampton'; you have to put an S followed by several asterisks or swear words!</p> <p>Would I rather have my Oscar for The English Patient or see Portsmouth win the Premiership? That's a tough call. I think I'd keep the Oscar, because it means a lot to other people and it's a passport to work in my business, but there's practically nothing else I wouldn't trade. You can have my house but not my Oscar! On the other hand, it's an unimaginable fantasy for me that Portsmouth will ever be in a position to win the Premiership.</p> <p>\u0095 Interview by Denis Campbell</p>",
  "<p>AC Milan are ready to field all five of their non-EU players for today's game against Atalanta at the San Siro. Vice-president Adriano Galliani has told Gazzetta dello Sport that the club has sent a fax to the Italian FA informing them of their decision and is threatening to sue if they prevent clubs from fielding all their non-EU players together. </p> <p>In Italy first division teams can register five non-EU players, but only three of them can appear on the team list at each game. </p> <p>A court in Reggio Emilia has accepted an appeal by the Nigerian player Prince Ikpe Ekong against the Italian FA's rule that was preventing him playing for his team, Reggiana. Teams in the second division can register just one non-EU player, those of the third and fourth none. </p> <p>Ikpe was signed by Reggiana when the team was in the second division. He went on loan abroad, but now the club, currently in third divi sion, can't use the player. So Ikpe decided to appeal, and his case was immediately shouldered by AC Milan. </p> <p>The case was taken to the court by Milanese lawyer Leandro Cantamessa, the barrister won the case citing a new law in the Italian constitution that states that all foreigners resident in Italy, EU or not, must have the same rights as Italians. This is seen as a potential new Bosman ruling, the fall of the last barrier to limit the number of foreign players in the Italian league.</p>",
  "<p>Trials and tribulations are to Old Firm managers what rice is to south-east Asia, a severe staple diet that can breed toughness or break the spirit. </p> <p>Dick Advocaat has been rather overfed at Rangers in recent weeks, the little Dutchman's previously unquestioned nerve and character having been exposed to a reversal of fortune that has left the Ibrox side floundering in the Scottish Premier League behind Celtic and facing the final match in Group D on Tuesday to determine whether or not they progress to the second phase of the Champions League. </p> <p>Over at 'the other place' (supporters of Celtic and Rangers tend to refer to the home of their rivals in instantly decipherable code), the most impressive aspect of Martin O'Neill's stewardship is to be found by looking beyond the the performances of a team with 11 victories and two draws from 13 league matches, a place in the semi-finals of the CIS Insurance League Cup and a favourite's chance of eliminating Bordeaux from the Uefa Cup on Thursday. </p> <p>The Irishman's unflustered handling of the intensity that is at the core of any manager's work at Celtic Park - and which a predecessor of similar background, Liam Brady, confessed had overwhelmed him - has astonished those of us who had come to regard the job as probably the most hazardous in British football. </p> <p>O'Neill's achievement in this regard cannot be overstated. All of the baggage that normally accompanies new arrivals - Brady is only one of a group that includes Tommy Burns, Jozef Venglos, John Barnes and Kenny Dalglish - seems to have been sent to another destination. </p> <p>As he himself asserted the other day, it is a huge help when the team make the kind of productive start that promises a return to the glory days, but watching him go through his paces is enough to convince any observer with a working knowledge of the recent history of the club that his qualities are indisputably the first links in the chain. </p> <p>O'Neill simply hasn't allowed the old demons to get past his defences, bringing a buoyant optimism and encouragement to his work, which suggests that he regards the past as another country, where things are done differently. Where Europe is concerned, for example, it is possible that he is not even aware that is coming up to 21 years since Celtic last remained in a tournament beyond Christmas. </p> <p>Only just possible, of course, as he knows a great deal more than he admits. But even the datum that Celtic's 3-2 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of the European Cup in March 1980 was their last creditable achievement on the continent is likely to be dismissed as an irrelevance. </p> <p>His comments on Friday were tantamount to recognition of this tendency, when he said: 'There was talk here of players being disaffected, but I didn't find it so. The one thing I was determined to do was to judge players on what I saw, not what I heard. Talk of what went before had no relevance. </p> <p>'I was especially open-minded about those players I didn't know much about. I mean, a blind man could see that Henrik Larsson was an exceptional player and a great asset here. Many of the others I was able to assess from scratch. Now, there will be a few who are very disappointed about not being in the team at the moment. </p> <p>'You can't blame them as they are professional footballers and they want to play. It is important to keep people thinking they have a chance, that you have faith in them. But it's a murderous old business and players desperate to make the team are going to be disappointed. </p> <p>'But the best way to get a decent dressing-room up and running is to win a few matches. We've done that and I'm delighted, but I'll let you into a secret. These players are all happy with me now, but come March they'll be telling you I'm a complete bastard. There were guys at Leicester who were delighted when I left. Mind you, they were mainly guys who weren't in the team - and who still aren't in the team.' </p> <p>The 1-1 draw Celtic secured in the away leg of the tie with Bordeaux, allied to the probable return from injury of Chris Sutton - an outstanding contributor since his move from Chelsea - make the Parkhead side strongly fancied to win on their own turf. </p> <p>Curiously, the same cannot be said of Rangers, who require victory over Monaco to ensure one of the top two places in their Champions League group. The uncertainty about Advocaat's side could not have been predicted in September, when the Scottish champions followed their 5-0 home win over Sturm Graz in the opening match with a 1-0 victory in Monte Carlo, which took them into what had seemed a conclusive lead in the group. </p> <p>A casualty list that seemed to lengthen by the week led to defeats away to Galatasaray and Sturm and a draw at home to the Turks, which has left them vulnerable. Advocaat on Friday seemed uncharacteristically fretful about his team's prospects, lamenting what might have been - 'If we had beaten Galatasaray, we would already be through' - rather than emphasising the positive elements about having a home game in which to settle qualification. </p> <p>He is clearly still anxious about the fitness of two of his most formidable players, striker Michael Mols and midfielder Giovanni van Bronckhorst, admitting that, even if they made the kick-off, they would be a gamble. </p> <p>'I still think Monaco have the more dangerous forwards, so our first objective must be to be well organised, as we were in Monte Carlo,' he said, a strangely negative observation. As if realising this, he added: 'But I'm still confident that it is hard for any team in the world to beat us at Ibrox.' It is Advocaat's and Rangers' misfortune, however, that even a draw is unlikely to be enough.</p>",

  "<p>'Ice is nice when you ski in the right position,' said Meinhardt, our ski instructor in St Anton, cradle of Austrian skiing. 'When it is a little bit icy, we heff ze edges,' he emphasised with a large grin. 'And more edges equals more holiday.' </p> <p>Not having had a ski lesson in the Alps for over a decade, I was curious to see whether Alpine instruction had moved on from 'Bend ze knees and follow me'. </p> <p> <strong> Austria</strong> </p> <p> An instructor took me on to the snow, pointed up the hill and said: 'Go.' I trudged 100 metres up, put on my skis and made as many turns as I could in the short descent. 'Ok, join the ski safari (a ski tour of the Arlberg region) with Meinhardt. We can assess skiers just by how they handle the skis. Seeing them skiing confirms this.' </p> <p>Founded in the Arlberg by Hannes Schneider in the Twenties, the Austrian skiing technique is characterised by the wedel , a succession of fast turns on the fall-line. Today there are some 500 ski schools and over 12,000 instructors, all trained by the Austrian Ski Federation. Jurgen took up the story: 'Boot technology has transformed skiing. More recently the shaped, waisted (or 'carving') ski has made it easier to turn and edge the skis with less effort. Up to a certain level our teaching is the same as before; how to balance, feeling the support of boot and ski. Sliding is still the same. From about level four (advanced intermediates) we teach skiers to use the shape of the ski, to carve.' Across the Alps, adult beginners are recommended 'fun' carving skis - about nose height. </p> <p>'The main problem for skiers,' continued Jurgen, 'is how to shift the upper body and weight. Teaching is about how to break up a movement into parts. We have to let the client know what is wrong and how to make it right.' </p> <p>The Austrians, French and Swiss all divide skiers into six groups, from novice to expert. Instructors who speak good English are widely available. </p> <p>This was Meinhardt's tenth season teaching in St Anton. He graduated from the Austrian National Ski School over a five years, working first with beginners, then as a county instructor and finally as a national instructor. </p> <p>'Steve, more leg action up and down. We heff steel edges so the ice dumplings are no problem, unless we lean back into the slope.' Guilty as charged. 'If you use the expensive waisting of your skis properly, then you have more holiday. But if you let them slide, you might as well be on old-fashioned straight skis.' </p> <p>'Round turns are the best, Denise. Go slowly down for the whole steering phase. If you go down too quickly, you have no pressure left to apply and you lose the edge. This means less holiday.' </p> <p>Throughout the day Meinhardt emptied our minds of bad habits by a variety of tricks; skiing without sticks, touching our knees as we turned, synchronising turns with the skier in front, linking slalom poles with the next skier. He even produced a rope, which we had to wind around our midriff contrary to the direction of the turn. It worked. We found we leant down the hill more, naturally assuming a better position, skiing faster but still in control. Meinhardt summed it up over a beer. 'Skiing is kneeing. More leg action, more flex, don't waste the waist of your ski. Look down the hill.' </p> <p> <strong> France</strong> </p> <p> 'What is your exact skiing standard?' asked Lionel outside the Ecole du Ski Fran\u00e7ais (ESF) in Chamonix. After some cross-examination about how I handle black runs and moguls, a class was fixed. </p> <p>Of the 13,500 instructors in 250 French resorts, 80 per cent are male. The average age is 34. Lionel Didier, 33, who passed his ESF national diploma in 1989, has been a full-time instructor for six years. He usually works with English-speakers. 'When the English say they want to learn, they mean it,' he said.'They tell the truth about their skiing standard, so it is easy to put them in a class. Grouping is very important; a well-chosen group has a synergy that helps everyone improve. But a slow person feels pressure and the group gets bored.' </p> <p>Lionel puts great emphasis on the psychological aspect of the sport. 'You have to be attentive to people and their wishes. I would say your skiing reflects how you really are as a person.' So poetic, so very French. And so worrying - I was about to be rumbled. </p> <p>Lionel likes to teach by example and imitation. Technical explanations are saved for when people are resting. 'Copying is quicker than understanding. Look at me, see the picture and copy. I know what you are thinking, \"Ooof, it is steep, I am going to fall\".' </p> <p>Now for the first trick. 'What do we put on frightened horses? Blinkers. Hold your poles shoulder-width like a window frame. Look at the downhill view. Turn the window like a robot. Don't use the upper body to turn. Turn with a down-and-up motion. Was it a nightmare? Good. This means that with the window you can't use the type of turn you normally use; you have to use your weight.' </p> <p>The encouragement continues: 'If you are scared, don't look at the slope, don't think of what might happen: use your window. There is no one skiing technique. There are many - for ice, powder, crust, spring snow. With the knees you can be precise. In deep snow, not much edge. For ice, lots of edge. </p> <p>'Allez, Barbara.' Just up from a less advanced class, Barbara is apprehensive on the black runs, finding this group younger and fitter. Lionel is attentive. 'Trust me, ski behind me.' At the front of the class she will not notice the speed. Her confidence increases. We try another trick - lifting the uphill knee while keeping the ski tip on the snow; this keeps the weight forward. 'Don't set your mental computer into turning mode, but into feeling what the ski is doing. Once you feel it, you have it forever.' </p> <p> <strong> Switzerland</strong> </p> <p> 'Gravity is a game,' began Gaby Fischer, our instructor in Nendaz, near Verbier. 'Carving skis have transformed Swiss teaching. Instruction used to be more academic.Now we no longer seek perfection, we just have fun.' The Swiss Ski School, established in 1930, formerly taught to a rigid format. But the Swiss have revamped their methods as a direct result of the now-standard carving skis. Qualifying as a Swiss ski instructor is harder than ever, with 65 per cent failing the skiing tests in the first assessments. It takes nearly six weeks over two years to qualify as a Professor de Ski, with annual refreshers. </p> <p>'Now that the pistes are always prepared and bumps are harder to find, skiers can enjoy a wider, stabler and more individual stance,' said Gaby, now in his seventh season teaching in Nendaz. With typical Swiss precision the all-important 'resistance to the snow' has been broken down into a number of key elements which apply equally to snowboarding: edge, slide, find resistance, make the turn; weight and unweight, set the edge. </p> <p>In my intermediate class, Gaby taught initiation of the turn from the centre of gravity, the belly-button; move this in the desired direction of travel and everything else follows. Gaby's teaching was supplemented by a variety of trick turns. We tried the crab, the Swedish, the Norwegian, even some faltering freestyle. He tailored his advice to our personalities.'Some people are tactile, some artistic, some musical. We try all sorts of things. Rachel, try thinking of long turns as a melody, like a waltz. Mike, on short turns, you need aggression, more techno, more samba.' </p> <p> I left the Alps feeling that instruction is better than it has ever been. With the latest equipment, skiing has become easier and more fun. Great care is taken to place the skier in the right group. Good teaching today depends not so much on traditional national methods, which are moving ever closer together, but on the instructor's personality. </p> <p>My instructors were attentive, innovative and perceptive. Lionel showed me a window in the mist. Gaby got me waltzing in difficult snow. And Meinhardt got me using my knees and edges so I had 'more holiday'. </p> <p>But in the end, you still have to 'bend ze knees'. It is just that now, they have so many different ways of telling you how to do it.</p> <p><strong>Downhill all the way</strong></p> <p>Stephen Lee drove to the Alps, travelling from Portsmouth to Le Havre with <a href=\"http://www.poportsmouth.com\">P&amp;O Portsmouth</a>: 0870 2424 999.</p> <p><strong>Switzerland</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.switzerlandtourism.ch\">www.switzerlandtourism.ch</a><br> Nendaz - <a href=\"http://www.skinendaz.ch\">www.skinendaz.ch</a> Hotel Deserteur: good position and old Swiss charm (00 41 27 288 2455)</p> <p><strong>Austria</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.austria-tourism.at\">www.austria-tourism.at</a><br> St Anton - <a href=\"http://www.stantonam arlberg.com\">www.stantonam arlberg.com</a><br> Hotel Neue Post: superb position and elegance.

  "<p>The final showdown was just over three weeks ago. It had been a long time coming. On Wednesday, 11 October, Chris Woodhead, the ever-controversial Chief Inspector of Schools, was called to a meeting with David Blunkett at the Department for Education and Employment. Blunkett had discovered that his Chief Inspector had been in secret talks with the Daily Telegraph, a paper fiercely opposed to Labour's education policies. What's more, he had been offered a consultancy with Bell-Pottinger, the Thatcherite public relations lobbying company that ran the campaign to support Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. </p> <p>As he waited in the glass atrium, with its faux-rural fountains and hanging greenery, Woodhead's thoughts might have turned to the mountains that are his true passion as a climber. His mind was certainly no longer focused entirely on his job at the Office for Standards in Education. Friends told The Observer this weekend that Woodhead had been talking privately about the job offers for at least three months and was just waiting for the right moment to leave. When Blunkett rumbled him, he was left with no choice but to resign. </p> <p>It was the end of an era. After six years in the post, Woodhead had become a national figure, where his predecessors had been anonymous civil servants. For his supporters, the Woodhead tough-love approach saved state education from trendy lefties and 'child-centred' teaching methods. But in the process, said his opponents, his brutal Ofsted regime drove teachers out of the profession. </p> <p>Sources close to Blunkett and Woodhead said the meeting itself was cordial: no shouting or stamping of feet. In fact, the only point of conflict over the past three weeks has been Woodhead's refusal to give the Secretary of State confirmation that he really was going. </p> <p>The relationship between the two men over the three years of the Labour Government had been fraught, but Blunkett had been repeatedly forced to publicly back his Chief Inspector: when Tony Blair first said a Labour Government would retain Woodhead, appointed under the Tories, prompting fury among teachers; when he announced the renewal of his contract in 1998; and when, during six difficult months last year, the press focused on the alleged affair Woodhead had with a sixth-former 25 years ago. </p> <p>In 1997 Blunkett had famously said there would be only one education boss under Labour. Woodhead spent three years attempting to prove otherwise. Finally, last Wednesday he threw in the towel, claiming he could no longer support Blunkett's policy on education. </p> <p>His close friend and climbing partner David Hopkins, professor of education at Nottingham University, said Woodhead had become increasingly bored and frustrated at Ofsted. But even Hopkins, one of the few members of the education establishment to lend his full support to the Chief Inspector, said it was probably right to move on from the Woodhead era: 'There is no doubt that Ofsted has sharpened up the performance of schools and put the debate about standards fully on the agenda. But now is the time to have a wider debate about it.' </p> <p>It is an open secret in Whitehall that Woodhead had fallen out with the two key civil servants at the DfEE: Permanent Secretary Michael Bichard and Michael Barber, Blunkett's favourite education guru and head of the Standards and Effectiveness Unit. Insiders say Woodhead's rudeness has become spectacular: at a meeting of the Standards Task Force last month, it is said, he became so irritated by Barber that he lay back in his chair and put his feet on the table while he was speaking. </p> <p>It is now clear that Woodhead's ideological differences with the Government run far deeper than anyone imagined. He said last week that he didn't believe the Government was doing enough to dismantle the power of local education authorities and pass control to individual headteachers. In an interview with the Guardian last month, he said A-levels were too easy for the brightest children. Although exams do not fall within his remit, he repeated the claims at last week's education select committee in the Commons, despite being unable to give any evidence to back them up. </p> <p>He is also bitterly opposed to appointment of 'learning mentors' at inner-city schools, which he sees as a soft touch. But it is thought that the final straw was a government proposal to introduce performance-related pay. Woodhead had argued vociferously against a centralised, bureaucratic scheme, believing the extra money should have been given to schools to pay teachers as they wish. </p> <p>He has always claimed that as a servant of the Crown he is answerable not to the Secretary of State, but to the the Prime Minister himself via the Commons select committee. But his relations with the committee, never good, have become increasingly strained under its new chairman, Barry Sheerman, who rebuked him last Wednesday for suggesting that Liberal Democrat member Evan Harris was too stupid to understand what he was saying. </p> <p>By then Woodhead knew that his resignation was likely to be announced the next day. The select committee also criticised his failure to meet researchers from the Commission for Racial Equality over a period of four months. The chair of the commission, Gurbux Singh, described Woodhead's correspondence over the matter as offensive. The Chief Inspector's more than usually abrasive style over recent months can now be attributed to the fact that he was already feeling demob happy. </p> <p>There is hardly a figure in public life who so divides public opinion as Woodhead. For his - often right-wing - supporters, such as Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre and his new boss at the Telegraph, Charles Moore, he is the most important educational reformer since the comprehensive system was set up in the mid-Sixties. For his detractors, generally on the Left, such as Tim Brighouse, head of the giant Birmingham local education authority, and Ted Wragg of Exeter University, he is a charlatan, prepared to generalise about the failings of the education system without any evidence for his assertions. </p> <p>Professor David Reynolds, who developed the Government's numeracy strategy, believes the Chief Inspector had simply outlived his usefulness as a talisman for New Labour's standards drive. 'More than anybody he exposed the unacceptable gulf in standards between teachers and between schools. But when it comes to possible solutions he retreated into political soundbites and armchair philosophy.' </p> <p>As time went on, Woodhead became increasingly divorced from a modern teaching profession he had helped create, Reynolds said. 'He simply didn't understand schools and classrooms enough to deal with the problems he had correctly identified.' This dogged refusal to brook any criticism was illustrated earlier this year after a spate of teacher suicides was attributed to the stress of the inspection regime. The Chief Inspector refused to apologise or admit any responsibility for the deaths. </p> <p>Many believe Woodhead had already ceased to be a credible force after his announcement last February that relationships between pupils and sixth-formers could be 'experiential and educative'. His comments were in direct opposition to government legislation, which made such relationships illegal. When it was discovered that Woodhead himself had been involved with 17-year-old Amanda Johnston, his pupil when he was a teacher at Gordano School near Bristol in the mid-Seventies, a storm of controversy followed. </p> <p>The press campaign against Woodhead lasted almost two months and led David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, to demand a police investigation into charges that the couple had lied in affidavits seen by Blunkett. Sources close to Blunkett have told The Observer than one more story about Woodhead's private life would have toppled the Chief Inspector last spring. </p> <p>His wife Cathy, who claimed Woodhead was lying when he said the relationship started after the couple left the school in the autumn of 1976, is still furious that there has been no investigation into the affair. She told The Observer this weekend that she still believed Blunkett had serious questions to answer. 'I'm still convinced there has been a cover-up,' she said. </p> <p>Speculation has already begun about Woodhead's future, and some friends are predicting a career in politics. Woodhead has boasted that he was offered a seat in the Lords by John Major before the last election - he believed he could become an Education Minister in a future Conservative administration, but decided to take his chances as Chief Inspector under Blair. This weekend Conservative Party Central Office was refusing to confirm - or deny - the Major offer and would not say whether William Hague has made a similar suggestion. </p> <p><strong>Woodhead's wisdom</strong></p> <p>On the Ofsted regime: 'An element of threat is not necessarily a bad thing. I personally respond to threats. The education system has been immune to any kind of threat for too long.'<br><strong>September 1994</strong></p> <p>On new teachers: 'Their ability to teach reading is of particular concern. If new teachers cannot master the basics, maybe we should worry about their competence to teach at all.'<br><strong>November 1995</strong> </p> <p>On the 15,000 incompetent teachers: 'Such teachers cannot continue.'<br><strong>November 1995</strong> </p> <p>On pupil-teacher relationships: 'I think human beings can get themselves into messes, and I think those messes can be educative and experiential on both sides.'<br><strong>February 1999</strong> </p> <p>On morality: 'We all experience situations where it is not possible to act in accordance with our values.'<br><strong>February 2000</strong> </p> <p>On Gurbux Singh, Chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, after Ofsted was criticised for insensitivity to race issues: 'Your self-righteous indignation amazes me.'<br><strong>July 2000</strong> </p> <p>On Lib Dem MP Evan Harris's inability to see how A-levels needed to be harder when standards had not fallen: 'I'm sorry if you find it difficult to hold those two propositions in your head but I don't think it's too hard really.'<br><strong>November 2000</strong></p>",
  "The Government's tough line on drugs will take a significant turn this week when Mo Mowlam calls for a 'sensible debate' on the issue and admits that a 'just say no' policy no longer works. <p>In a series of interviews, Mowlam, the Cabinet Office Minister with responsibility for drugs policy, will say that treatment for people vulnerable to the drugs trade should be enhanced and that there should be greater understanding of how poverty and bleak prospects push people into drug-taking. </p> <p>She will also back her colleague, Cabinet Office Minister Ian McCartney, who last week argued for a 'new realism' on drugs and launched a campaign to give young people advice on taking precautions if they insisted on taking drugs. </p> <p>McCartney faced personal tragedy last year when his son Hugh died from a heroin overdose in a squalid tenement flat in Parkhead, Glasgow. He was 23. </p> <p>Mowlam's move will reveal the deep splits in the Cabinet over drugs policy. </p> <p>The Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, take a much harder line on the drugs issue than Mowlam, who caused controversy when she suggested there should be a debate about the decriminalisation of cannabis. She has also admitted to taking cannabis when she was young. </p> <p>Sources close to Mowlam said she would go as far as she could in promoting her own more liberal stance while keeping within the broad framework of Government policy. </p> <p>She has apparently been shocked by visits around Britain and to New York where she met people involved in drugs. </p> <p>Instead of condemning drug-taking, she believes a more sophisticated view needs to be taken, which addresses young people who find the Government's tough stance a turn-off. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Mowlam will announce a \u00a394 million treatment scheme for drug-takers that will allow the present 60,000 treated a year to be increased to 90,000. </p> <p>A report released on the same day by the Government's drugs tsar, Keith Hellawell, will reveal a large increase in seizures of heroin and cocaine. </p> <p>The report, which will say that more than \u00a31 billion worth of drugs was seized by customs officers and police, will also reveal a 10 per cent increase in the confiscation of assets from criminals involved in the drugs trade. </p> <p>The \u00a37m taken from criminals will now be used to fund treatment centres. More money to help schools run drugs awareness courses will also be announced. </p> <p>Supporters of a more liberal approach to drugs policy will also be encouraged by new evidence that reveals cannabis users are already bypassing the law by using the internet and mobile phone networks to supply each other with drugs. </p> <p>Cannabis lobbyists who have become frustrated by adulterated dope supplied at high prices by criminals have now set up a national registration scheme to improve supplies. </p> <p>They believe they have created a foolproof system to put growers and customers in direct touch with each other over the web and avoid prosecution by the police. The scheme, called Cannabis Registration, has been devised in consultation with lawyers and web designers and will go live tomorrow. </p> <p>They believe recent confessions by a third of the Shadow Cabinet, two Ministers and at least two dozen MPs that they have all tried cannabis means there will be less official hostility to the scheme. </p> <p>A recent report by the Police Federation recommended the decriminalisation of cannabis, while the former chief constable of Gwent, Francis Wilkinson, has called for its complete legalisation. </p> <p>Neil Morgan, from South Wales, said he founded Cannabis Registration as a result of frustration over government inaction and its refusal to decriminalise the drug. </p> <p>'The time for talk is over; it's time to do things,' he said. 'This is direct action. People have to stand up for what they believe in.' </p> <p>The website divides the UK into geographical regions according to the Ordnance Survey map, and will provide prospective users with a mobile telephone number for a grower in their area. </p> <p>If police try to track down growers by pretending to be customers, they will be guilty of entrapment, making any prosecution invalid. </p> <p>Morgan said: 'The whole thing has been sorted out to the final detail.' </p> <p>Most of the cannabis consumed in the UK is heavily adulterated, often with toxic substances, in order to boost the profits of the dealers, who are sometimes prepared to be violent to protect their livelihood. </p> <p>Neil Montgomery, consultant anthropologist to the government-sponsored UK Medicinal Cannabis Project, said: 'Most cannabis sold in the UK is called \"soap bar\", which is heavily adulterated with everything from plastic and boot polish to diesel. We analysed one piece that was 8 per cent soil.' </p> <p><b>The facts about cannabis</b></p> <p>\u0095 Six million British people have used cannabis, including a third of the Shadow Cabinet. </p> <p>\u0095 The number of people given a criminal record for breaking the cannabis laws has risen fourfold in 10 years, to 96,381 in 1998. </p> <p>\u0095 Only 0.5 per cent of people think that upholding the cannabis laws should be a top police priority, according to the Police Foundation. </p> <p>\u0095 Last year, 2,838 people went to prison for possession of cannabis. </p> <p>\u0095 The annual cost of upholding the cannabis law is estimated at \u00a31.5 bn. </p> <p>\u0095 More British schoolchildren have tried cannabis than any other nationality in Europe. </p> <p>\u0095 Queen Victoria used cannabis for treating her period pains.</p> <p>\u0095 First reference to drug in 2737BC by Chinese emperor Shen Nung. </p> <p><b>Useful link</b><br><a href=\"http://ccnews.org.uk\" < a>Website of Cannabis Community News</a></p>",
  "<p>On the second of April this year, I finished 'My Roots' with the sentence: 'A solo garden must be tinged with loneliness.' The response to this was instantaneous. A single man emailed me to say: 'I have lived alone for all of my adult life. I am not lonely, I enjoy my own company and the company of others. You are profoundly wrong in implying that single gardeners must be lonely. Worse, by putting that view in writing, you are promoting the myth that the single lifestyle is inherently worse. Frankly, the thought of having to share decisions about my garden with someone else horrifies me, but then we are all different. Please respect that diversity.' </p> <p>And a single woman emailed me to tell me about the 'people' (plants) that filled her garden. I completely identify with this because plants do become familiar, even loved, as individuals. If they die you cannot just replace them with another of the same size, shape and variety any more than you can replace a person. They can and often do have individual identities. 'I have to take issue with your last remark in \"My Roots\",' she wrote . 'My garden is a solo effort, and even though I always work in it alone, it is thronged with people_ I sometimes pause in a smiling reverie, trowel in hand - and forget what I went out to do! Solo does not necessarily equal lonely.' </p> <p>There were others, all in a similar vein. The truth is that although I enjoy my own company, I have a horror of being really alone. I need a mate to feel complete. This might be because I am a twin and thus have never known separateness without loneliness, or might be because I am sufficiently undeveloped as an individual to make it on my own. Either way, I can't imagine the degree of self-sufficiency needed to make a garden entirely by and for myself. But I accept that this is a failure of imagination and is clearly not universally true. Many people are alone because they choose to live and garden alone. </p> <p>Their garden then takes on a different role. It becomes garden as companion and gardening as an interactive thing. Now, if there are more than one of you involved (and I believe that it is impossible to make a decent garden with more than two people involved at a creative level) a lot of that to-ing and fro-ing is done between you. You discuss. Argue a little. There is an awful lot of 'Whadya think?' and 'What if..?' It is a genuinely collaborative effort. </p> <p>One of the most interesting aspects of filming Real Gardens over the past three years has been seeing how the dynamics of a household affected the garden. I never visited a gardener who lived alone. I don't think I ever knowingly have. In almost every case there was a dominant personality who 'did' the garden. The spouse often initially played a low-key, even negative, role. But as time went by, it became apparent that they invariably had a powerful influence over every aspect of the garden, even if it was a negative one. A garden made despite other occupants of the house is a storyboard of anger and frustration, another measure of an unfulfilled life. Think of all the primped and tightly dragooned gardens run by tight-lipped, angry old men while angrier women clean the house to death indoors. </p> <p>So gardening alone can definitely be a liberation of sorts. There is something exhilaratingly creative about deliberately pleasing yourself. The first thing to do is to define the degree of privacy you need and want. Different strokes for different folks, but I know that I want my garden to be entirely private if I am to enjoy it to the full. In my experience, the only way to avoid the horror of loneliness is to enjoy being physically on your own, and the first stage along that route is to create a domestic aesthetic where the only value judgements are your own. For me, this means not being overlooked if at all possible, and no uninvited human presence. In an ideal world, this means screening the edges of your garden with a combination of walls, fences, trellis and hedges and, even if that is not possible, creating an inner sanctum within the more public gaze of the garden at large, with a genuinely private area where you can see the parts of the garden you want but cannot be overlooked. </p> <p>Then clearly that privacy gets filled by an extension of yourself. On one level, it is impossible to advise or instruct on how that might manifest itself without contradicting the notion of glorious individual, solitary freedom of expression. But on another, I think it is even more important to look and read like mad if you are making a garden on your own. The reading is easy, if potentially expensive, although most local libraries have a fairly decent selection of gardening books. </p> <p>It always astonishes me that people would rather go to the trouble of writing to someone like me to ask advice or inspiration than pop into the library and get a book that will do the job better. I am writing this with shelves behind me holding more than 1,000 gardening books. However creative you are, you need to be challenged and stimulated to respond well, and short of a gardening companion, books play that role supremely well. </p> <p>Looking involves going and visiting other people's gardens as much as possible. Always take a notebook and pencil and, if possible, a camera. In fact, I cannot recommend too highly the practice of taking pictures of your own garden - however basic or humble - on a regular basis. It is astonishing how you forget what you have done, and the combination of photographs and a daily garden diary adds greatly to the pleasure and success of a garden. By looking at other people's gardens - even the huge, thronged gardens of the great and good - you can expand the solitary possibilities of your own private backyard. </p> <p>However private, there is an element of all gardens that is pure theatre. I simply cannot imagine not wanting to share that with others. Tucked in behind that statement is the suggestion that solitary gardeners have no one to share with - which I realise is absurd. But I think it means a different kind of sharing. If you garden with a companion, you share small, intimate moments: the light catching the leaves just so, that hour when the primroses are poised on the edge of glory. </p> <p>A solo gardener rolls out the garden like a performance. It is part of entertaining, a tool of friendship. This is fun and I wish we did more of it - I suspect that this side of gardening gets sublimated in the casual sharing of coupledom. Balanced against presenting the garden as an all-singing, all-dancing personal work of art is the simple pleasure of gardening. Quietly pottering around with just a radio for company is one of the great secrets of happiness: not doing anything for show or public acclaim, but simply for the love of it. Alone.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>We shall have a bonfire tonight unless the rain is torrential, but I know there are some people who find bonfires deeply antisocial, about on par with people smoking in restaurants. </p> <p>I had a letter from someone saying his asthma drove him indoors every time one of his neighbours lit up, so to speak. But we keep the bonfire heap as a vital piece of the garden and its presence is the source of constant debate. We have a good bonfire site with room to put all burnable rubbish, but it does take up a lot of space.</p> <p>Yet life would be difficult without a bonfire at all. You cannot compost or shred everything. What do you do with the bindweed, ground elder and couch-grass roots, diseased hellebore leaves or box-hedge clippings? What do you do with your magazines? (Not this one, of course - it composts beautifully.) Surely it is better to burn these things and spread the ashes on the garden than to add to the huge quantity of rubbish that goes into landfill sites?</p> <p>We can't move it nearer the neighbours lest they rush in, batten down all their windows and reach for the phone to complain, as well they might. And anyway, there is nowhere else it could go without severe horticultural compromise. Problems, problems.</p> <p>Because of my dodgy shoulder I've been wandering around the garden looking much more than usual. Normally I look until I see an irresistible job and close my eyes to everything else until that is done. But for the last week I have been out, new digital Ixus in hand, taking pictures. The pictures then fly down onto my computer screen and I spend hours studying them. It is both a record for next year's planting and also a means of objectively assessing what is going right and wrong without the sensual assault of real life.</p> <p>I spent an hour cutting back the leaves of hellebores. These have been seeding themselves freely and H orientalis has really taken hold in the Spring Garden. I long to cut all the old off, but I restricted myself to the noticeably diseased or floppy. I shall have another session at it in the new year, when they have drawn all possible nourishment from their old foliage.</p> <p><strong>Your roots: Planting tulips and storing dahlias</strong></p> <p>November is the best time to plant tulips. Actually, it is the best time to plant just about anything, but especially tulips. There are two schools of thought about tulip planting. </p> <p>The conventional one is that they need planting particularly deep - which means making a hole about 6in deep, preferably with an inch or two of grit popped in the hole first, to add to the drainage. This is a counsel of perfection and applies really to tulips planted in mixed borders where they are to remain in position all their lives.</p> <p>The other method is to plant them an inch or so down with a trowel, where they will get at the best soil, and then to lift them after flowering to be replanted next year.</p> <p>Lift the tubers of dahlias as soon as they blacken off and die down. Cut off the top growth and store in a box of dry soil or potting compost. It is a mistake to let them completely dry out, although they should be stored in a dry, cool (but frost-free) and dark place. Check them every few weeks to see that they are not drying up too much or being attacked by mice.</p>",
  "<p>No sooner have you dusted yourself down, picked up the pieces and returned to that blissful state of emotional tranquillity and delicious self-indulgence, then along comes somebody to mess it all up again. Within weeks, your social life has been pruned down to the occasional dinner party with other couples, while weekends are spent fighting over the remote control and trying to lure the lumpish body next to you out for a walk. A life that you managed perfectly yourself becomes a minefield of tricky situations brought about by attempting to share responsibilities. </p> <p>Yet the coveted state of singledom continues to be seen as a compromise. When was the last time you heard somebody say pityingly, 'Poor thing, she's still married, you know' - yet that's exactly the sort of presumptuous insult that's hurled at the single dweller on a regular basis. This despite the fact that many marriages involve more misery and compromise than most people who choose to go it alone will experience in a lifetime. The accepted wisdom, that from the day we're born we're duty bound to seek out a like-minded person who'll make two become one, defies logic. You only need the most basic grasp of mathematics to know that two is always two. </p> <p>I had my macro Damascene revelation on the joys of being single about three years ago. It was early morning and the pale light of a wintry sun trickled through my bed-room curtains as I stretched myself diagonally over the expanse of my double bed. Wearing my recently departed ex's pyjama bottoms and my own vest, I shuffled into the kitchen and prepared myself a cappuccino and a bowl of cereal. Then, picking up the newspaper from my doorstep, I slipped back between the still-warm sheets. The radio alarm had switched itself on, and John Humphrys's sonorous tones were reassuring me that, despite a few hiccups, the world hadn't ended overnight. </p> <p>As I lolled around on my bed reading the news and trying to remember my plans for the day ahead, I experienced a quiver of smug contentment. No more breakfast television, no more checking my watch when I was enjoying the company of friends, no more declining of invitations from people who bored him or vice versa, as much theatre as I wanted, no more Sky Sport. The list of my blessings was endless. I was free. I was single again. After years of whining self pity during my regular phases of being single I'd suddenly realised that, far from a being punishment, it was an idyllic state to be savoured. </p> <p>Of course, you can write me off as being a smug yuppie with a comfortable lifestyle and a selfish nature. But you'd be wrong. My modicum of financial security was hard earned, and as for being single, I've tried as hard as anyone to make terrible relationships work. Yet it never occurred to me to rise to the converse challenge of creating a worthwhile lifestyle alone. Like most people in their late thirties, over the last 20 years I've succumbed to the lure of cohabitation on a few occasions. My ex-boyfriends remain good friends, but as I watch them fall like skittles into new unions, I find surprisingly that I don't envy them at all. I've no doubt that despite my best efforts I won't remain in this heavenly state uninterrupted, but the chances are I will return to it again, and again, and again. Marriage has an undeserved reputation as the only way of life worth aspiring to, cohabitation comes a close second, and the popular misconception is that no one would choose to be single. A faintly hypocritical scenario when you look at the state of modern relationships. In the clear light of day, and with the right attitude, going it alone offers many advantages. </p> <p>Nevertheless, being single, particularly as a woman, continues to get a bad press. Pitied (poor thing can't get a man), vilified (single-mum syndrome) or condescended to (isn't it time you grew up) but never celebrated as a chosen way of life. I don't want to turn this into a diatribe about the male of the species - in general I have only the fondest feelings for the opposite sex - but it does seem slightly unjust that when a man chooses to remain a bachelor, he's openly envied by his cohabiting friends and admired by the world at large. A woman in the same position finds none of that respect forthcoming, and can only pray that the day the label 'single' turns to 'spinster' is further away than her menopause. For centuries, men have been prolonging their 'merry bachelor' days. Is it mere coincidence that women only reach a similar jovial state when they become 'merry widows'? I suppose it stands to reason. If a woman has never had the 'official' stamp of approval from a man, then what on earth has she got to be happy about? </p> <p>Any declaration on the joys of being single is invariably met with a sympathetic smile and a pat on the head for being brave enough to pretend you're not suicidal. If you don't answer questions regarding your love life with a resigned shrug and an 'I'll try to do better' attitude, people think there's something wrong with you. No matter how good a time you're having as a single woman, you are expected to be a bit ashamed. It wouldn't do to turn up to a dinner party and boast about the incredible sex you had all weekend with a man you met at a fabulous party two weeks previous. 'What a shame you couldn't get a babysitter; don't even remember what time we left but we danced for hours.' The couples who weren't plain horrified at the notion of such grotesquely casual sex (funny how moralistic people get after they've settled down) would be consumed with envy disguised as sympathy for your delusional state. 'I honestly think she really believes she's enjoying herself,' accompanied by a caring shake of the head while you're happily showing off your bite marks to the person sitting next to you. </p> <p>Sex for the single girl is unquestionably a tricky issue. Even in these supposedly emancipated times, it's still regarded as an activity that men should take pride in doing a lot of and women should try hard to pretend they never indulge in - unless it's in a monogamous, long-term relationship. Well, we all make mistakes and the longevity of the relationship is something none of us can guarantee when, overcome by passion, we find ourselves cavorting on the sofa. Unless, of course, we have a hotline to Mystic Meg. </p> <p>Women may be less profligate with their sexual favours, but they get just as bored by regular bad sex, or indeed just the same old sex. A married girlfriend recently turned to me in fury when I questioned the wisdom of her flirtation with another man. 'You have no idea what it's like to sleep with the same man day in, day out for 15 years. Why shouldn't I have a tiny frisson of excitement in my life?' </p> <p>I'm not recommending infidelity, but she had a point. As Bridget Jones so rightly said, if every married person who condescendingly enquires as to whether you've 'found a boyfriend yet?' had to illuminate you on the last time they had exciting sex (or just sex), they would soon desist. 'Yes, I've found a boyfriend, two or three this year, actually! Oh sorry, don't look so disappointed; didn't mean to gloat. How's Charles?' </p> <p>Most of my married friends question me relentlessly about whom I'm dating in a way single friends fail to do. My independently minded friends aren't less interested, they're just way too busy living their own lives - something I'm afraid cohabitees stop doing the minute they start sharing a front door. How else do you explain the wistful look in their eyes when you tell them you're off to Vietnam for a month? The urgency of their messages when a newspaper reports on an alleged tryst with George Clooney? The obvious resentment when you're shopping together at the Gap and you buy yourself a leather skirt while they hunt for baby dungarees? </p> <p>Men understood way back the benefits of staying single for as long as possible. It wasn't an enlightened state brought about by superior intelligence, but during the Dark Ages only they had the wherewithal. Now, finally, women have the opportunity to enjoy the lifestyle they've worked hard to create. Only a lunatic would leap off that bandwagon having only just managed to manoeuvre your way on! The second your deposit account has upwards of a three-figure balance is surely not the time to throw in the towel and start procreating. The fun is only just beginning. Hooking up with someone involves such a plethora of compromises that just thinking about it makes me nervous. I haven't slogged my guts out for 20 years to spend my much-needed holidays with a man who wants to play Moby Dick on a sun lounger while I trail around the cultural hotspots desperately wishing I had a girlfriend there to keep me company. Or, worse still, not even getting to make those trips thanks to an endless stream of boring in-laws whose only interest is in whether you're up the duff yet. I have trouble enough trying to keep up with my own family without embracing the assorted dysfunction of somebody else's. </p> <p>I want to see the world, meet Machiavellian people, read more books, sleep in, stay out, spend three weeks in a row without switching the television on, eat toast and Marmite four times a day for a month. None of those minor indulgences seem possible once you've let a partner muscle in on your life. Yet I have to listen to endless diatribes from unsingle buddies trying to convince me (and more frequently themselves) that life has perked up since they found someone to push the trolley around Sainsbury's for them. I can let weeks go by without venturing anywhere near a supermarket. Contrary to popular perception, when I open the fridge door and discover only a bottle of delicious wine and a bag of prunes (instead of several varieties of fruit juice and a winebox that hides the telltale signs of tippling) I'm not depressed for a moment. Instead I'm beside myself with relief that it's not full of snack-sized Babybels and six-packs of hideous fruit yogurts. </p> <p>The other day I found myself plucking the ends off a bag full of exotic salad leaves because my friend's husband doesn't enjoy the stems. 'Tell him to do it himself,' I finally snapped when the mundanity of my task grew too much to bear and the gales of laughter from the guests in the sitting room too enticing. 'That's the sort of attitude that explains why you'll never find a husband,' she retorted. Was it churlish of me to point out that that's one of the myriad reasons I don't want another husband at present? </p> <p> For, yes, I too once fell by the wayside. Marriage is something that, with the benefit of hindsight, I now consider on a par with smoking - a bad habit that you either pick up when you're young, or manage to avoid until you're old enough not to care about the repercussions. I leapt enthusiastically into that cauldron at the age of 18 and back out again three years later with third-degree emotional burns. Friends often ask why I don't describe myself as a divorc\u00e9e. When I ask why I should, they mumble an answer which even they are embarrassed to be verbalising. Being divorced is still considered a step better than single, apparently. It means someone once wanted you. No surprise, then, that 'spinster' is by definition a woman who was never lucky enough to marry, yet bachelors remain bachelors forever if they so desire. Society wants to be able to easily identify these poor, failed specimens so we can learn by their mistakes. I'm sorry to disappoint, but I'm less proud of the fact I made an error once than I am of my choice to remain independent ever since. </p> <p>When you ask people to define single, they often find themselves at a loss for words. Does it mean someone who lives alone? Someone who's not dating? In that case, I wasn't single last week; I'm single at present; but between now and the New Year, I'll probably only be single for a couple of weeks. The whole notion of singledom in an era of escalating divorce rates, when unconventional liaisons often outlive their more conventional friends' unions, is faintly ridiculous. It's also a label that only counts in the eye of the beholder. Unless I take out an ad in a national newspaper to announce my union with another or have sex publicly and regularly with one partner, I will continue to be perceived as single. What I do in my private life and the privacy of my own bedroom, or his, or wherever else we choose, doesn't alter my status unless I make a public declaration. One of the happiest couples I know lives in separate flats in the same building. Are they single or just plain happy? It makes you wonder if the only reason we do get married or cohabit is to convince other people that we're not repulsive. </p> <p>The independence of a career introduces the possibility of choosing to live alone, and it's an improvement to the status quo that my generation seem all too happy to embrace. Remember, we've lived through the Ice Storm era. Watched our parents fight their way through unhappy marriages or deal with society's disapproval if they chose to escape. That scourge of society, a single mother, raised me. With no money and no man to speak of, she brought up four functional, participating members of society. Five, if you count me! Now she's finally enjoying her 'state of independence' holidays with friends to Spain or Italy, weekends at music festivals in Wales - she never seems to have a spare moment.The opportunity to have similar choices without waiting for my widow's pension is a legacy my mother and her generation fought hard to be able to hand down. I'm not so naive as to believe you can have it all, but you've certainly got to try and get your paws on as much as possible while you can. </p> <p>Perhaps my own experiences of 'happy coupledom' have something to do with my reticence to share door keys at present. They say that living alone is lonely, but I don't think I've ever felt as alone as in the twilight months of a relationship when a once-busy double bed has become as wide and desolate as Antarctica. The possibility of reaching out for comfort from the other side is as ridiculous as warming your hands on an ice cube. </p> <p>Other low points of cohabitation include the plentiful nights I spent during one four-year tryst sitting at home with my lovingly prepared dinner for two while my partner went AWOL in the Bermuda triangle of Notting Hill pubs. During another relationship, I experienced the most miserable day of my working life. My partners dispensed with my services and my hitherto loyal assistant, with whom I'd been planning to set up a new business, deserted me for their offer of a new car. I called my boyfriend in tears and he offered to leave work early and meet me at home for crisis counselling. I raced back longing for a shoulder to cry and instead found myself weeping into my own chest for much of the night. He finally stumbled in at 2am mumbling about a prior engagement. Nowadays when I'm in trouble I know where to turn. </p> <p> Friendships are the one essential ingredient to a happy life that no single person can afford to underestimate. In the old days, the accepted form of behaviour when you managed to grab hold of a partner was to ditch your pals. Post singledom, your main contact was on the rare occasions when you tried to set them up with someone else. Again an arrogant assumption that what they really, really want is to be just like you. The 'libbers' of old may have been comrades on the picket line, but they kept one eye on their 'sisters in arms' to make sure they weren't running off with their husbands. They still lived in a dog eat dog world where hanging on to your man was imperative - perhaps the reason that old retainers like Fay Weldon and Janet Street Porter still rarely have a good word to say about their own sex. </p> <p>Nowadays we tend to value friendship much more than the opportunity of a leg-over with a pal's husband. For the post-marriage generation, friendship has established itself as the most stable relationship on offer. My friends and I joke about putting our savings into a farmhouse in Tuscany that we can share when we're old and incontinent. We plan on wheeling each other around and reminiscing while making passes at our hunky young gardeners. Friends are for life, while boyfriends tend to come and go. It's your friends who'll prop you up when your relationship crumbles, or you lose your job or life just gets too much. </p> <p>Of course there are lonely days and empty nights, but not just for people who choose to live alone - times when you want a cuddle and there's nobody there, or medicinal sex and not with a stranger. And of course the perfect relationship is an enticing dream. I used to experience physical heartache when watching an ex-boyfriend's parents together. They'd been married for 50 years, and yet when they danced with each other, they still looked like honeymooners. They used to wander around their own garden hand in hand, for heaven's sake! </p> <p>In this fractured world, that sort of 'happy marriage' is becoming an oxymoron. I'd like to have children and hope it will be with someone who adds another dimension to my life. It's true that one can never make two, but if you're lucky two can sometimes be better than one. Especially when they go on to make three and four. Meanwhile, and maybe forever, I intend to gobble up the world in gargantuan chunks. I have a suspicion that spending more time on enjoying your life and less time on seeking a partner may ultimately be the secret to both. One thing's for sure, though. Sitting around moping and waiting for Lancelot is a waste of time. And that's one thing you never have enough of.</p>",
  "At one o'clock tomorrow afternoon, Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, will sit down to a light buffet lunch with a small group of men in his office in Queen Anne's Gate in London. Over smoked salmon sandwiches and sparkling mineral water, they will review the war so far and look forward to the battles that lie ahead. On the sofas around the low coffee table will be Straw's junior Ministers, their aide, and a handful of key advisers. The weekly meetings tend to be informal and convivial. Tomorrow, the mood will be sterner. <p>The next 10 days may see Britain plunged into chaos not seen since the late Seventies. Protests against fuel prices will rage up and down the country. Motorways will be jammed with convoys of trucks; airports ringed with trailers. Fishing boats will block the Thames. Petrol stations will be out of fuel and supermarkets out of food. There will be running battles with the police. In September Britain staggered badly as protests flashed from Dartmouth to Dundee. This time, the protesters hope, Britain will be stretched full length on the tarmac. </p> <p>But, if Straw and his people have done their work well, there will be nothing more than a couple of heavily policed demonstrations and a few minor disruptions. They may distract momentarily from the chaos on the railways and the floods. The activists' hopes of forcing a cut in fuel tax, let alone a general election, will look risible. By the end of the month they will be back in their farmhouses and haulage firm offices with their exhaust pipes firmly between their legs. </p> <p>One of the biggest and most sophisticated operations of its kind ever run by a British government - involving tens of thousands of people from press officers to the head of MI5, from Army generals to low-level union officials - will have worked. The battle will have been won. </p> <p>At the Muir Town Lodge Hotel on the bleak shores of the Moray Firth in northern Scotland, there was talk of revolution last Wednesday night at an open meeting of the People's Fuel Lobby (PFL). Mark Francis, a haulier from Rhyl in Wales and a leader of the PFL, told the crowd that their cause was right and that if they held firm they would win the fight. </p> <p>The crowd listened carefully. Then several stood up to talk. A housewife said the cost of fuel was ruining her budget; a tourist worker said coaches couldn't afford to drive up from England to the Highlands. After two and a half hours, the meeting broke up. Within hours PFL leaders were heading for Newcastle and another planning session. </p> <p>Their aim is simple: to repeat what happened two months ago. Then, a dozen or so committed men caused chaos on a scale not seen in Britain for nearly 20 years. They forced the Government on to the defensive and, for one astonishing week, rode an unprecedented wave of public support. Only when the supermarkets were out of bread and milk, when hospitals cut back operations, when most fuel stations were out of petrol, did they end their protests. Almost overnight the blockades outside the oil refineries and the convoys jamming the motorways disappeared. </p> <p>But the activists, an ad hoc alliance of the frantic, the fanatic and the plain fed-up, did not end their protests unconditionally. Unless Gordon Brown, the Chancellor, made some move to lessen the burden of high fuel prices then, they made clear, the blockades would be back. Their deadline expires a week tomorrow. This Wednesday Brown is due to make his 'pre-Budget statement'. He is not expected to give much, if any, ground. The activists' demands of a 26p cut in the tax on fuel has fallen on deaf ears. There will be no 'hand-outs'. </p> <p>Brown and the protesters agree on one thing: if you want a fight, they are both saying, you can have one. And the fight will be fierce. </p> <p>'At the end of the day we are going to cause as much mayhem as possible,' Nigel Kime, a Lincolnshire haulier at the forefront of September's protests, told The Observer last week. </p> <p>Even the protesters don't yet know quite what form that mayhem will take. The aim is to cause disruption across the country. Last time oil refineries and fuel terminals were the primary target. But, as the oil firms have boosted defences - Shell's Stanlow refinery now boasts new concrete barriers - they may not be an initial target this time. Other plans include: </p> <p> \u0095 using trucks to blockade food distribution centres; </p> <p> \u0095 disrupting the National Grid by switching on farming and light industrial machinery to create surges of demand; </p> <p> \u0095 creating roadblocks by draining vehicles of fuel; </p> <p> \u0095 holding protests across railway lines to halt trains; </p> <p> \u0095 blockading milk depots; </p> <p> \u0095 organising small-scale strikes among supporters; </p> <p> \u0095 and demonstrating outside the homes of Labour MPs. </p> <p>Even before the expiry of the 13 November deadline some protesters will already be on the road. A convoy of lorries and tractors will leave Jarrow on Friday and head south at 25 mph through Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and Milton Keynes. A second convoy will leave John O'Groats heading for Edinburgh. By the time the main protest reaches London, on 14 November, the organisers hope it will be causing traffic queues 100 miles long. </p> <p>It will end - if the police let it - with a rally in Hyde Park. At the same time a fleet of trawlers will block the Thames. The protesters hope they can snarl up the capital for a week. </p> <p>'Seven days in London should present us with no problems,' says Kime, 37. 'If we end up stuck on the M25, then so be it. If we block up London, then we can seriously damage three major airports.' </p> <p>The key organiser is David Handley, a Monmouthshire farmer who heads the PFL and the more militant Farmers For Action. Handley, 48, has more than \u00a340,000 of debts and has been protesting on behalf of farmers for five years. His dairy farm, rented from Monmouthshire County Council, could soon be taken from him. </p> <p>Handley has left the running of his 88-acre property to his wife and dedicated himself to his campaigns. His boast that he can trigger protests practically anywhere at anytime is not idle. A 'bush telegraph' of mobile phones connecting hundreds of activists has been proven effective. </p> <p>He is not alone. Many, especially in north Wales, will be looking to Brynle Williams, a hillfarmer from near Mold, for leadership. Williams set the protesters' 60-day deadline and led the first protests in September. His associates say they are ready to go to jail. </p> <p>'Let them arrest us. Let's see how big their jail cells really are,' said Clive Swan, a neighbour of Williams's. </p> <p>Police and protesters worry that a few hotheads will hijack the demonstrations. There is evidence of infiltration from far right-wing organisations. There has also been interest from the left, from both anarchist groups and the Socialist Workers' Party. 'I am very worried. As soon as anything violent happens I'm off home,' said Rhys Parry, a farmer who co-ordinates protests in South Wales. </p> <p>The demonstrators' actions will put larger organisations sympathetic to their aims in a difficult position. The Road Haulage Association, the National Farmers Union and the Countryside Alliance all officially oppose direct action. But they face enormous pressure from members who support the protests. Handley is a member of the CA, and Williams is an official in the NFU. For everybody concerned the stakes are high. </p> <p>The Government's planning started in earnest on 18 September, days after the end of the last protests, with a meeting of a 'Fuel Task Force' in the Cabinet Office and of the Civil Contingency Committee, the Government's key crisis management unit. </p> <p>Blair and Straw knew they had to get it right. In the aftermath of the first blockades, the Tories overtook Labour in the polls, albeit fleetingly, for the first time since the 1992 election. The pair agreed that the Government had appeared to lose control. </p> <p>Their strategy was careful and clever. The Government worked out the threats they faced, then moved to eliminate them. One of Straw's first acts was to order one of the biggest undercover operations against non-terrorist targets in Britain for 20 years. </p> <p>Every local police force's Special Branch began to gather intelligence on the main leaders of the protests. The local media was monitored. Dossiers were compiled of activists' police records, finances and political views. Many were put under 'soft' surveillance. </p> <p>The Observer has learnt that operatives from MI5, the domestic security service, infiltrated a number of the more aggressive groups. Their information was critical in determining the Government's tactics. The divisions within the activists - particularly between Williams and Handley - were key. </p> <p>'It was perfect,' one intelligence source said. 'It played to one of this government's greatest strengths.' </p> <p>One of the first lessons learned from the September crisis was the importance of winning public opinion early. The Home Office and Downing Street agreed that a seven-day campaign of media management was needed. Those seven days ended yesterday. </p> <p>Last week was chosen as 'fuel week' because it looked like it would be quiet. Downing Street allowed only one key announcement a day. </p> <p>First, two Sunday newspapers were briefed about plans to use the military to make sure fuel got through. When The Observer had run the story a week earlier, government press officers downplayed it. Now they cranked as hard as they could. </p> <p>On Monday Straw urged people to 'get in stocks' and spoke of the threat to the NHS. On Tuesday and Wednesday Blair repeatedly said the Government would not act when threatened. At the end of the week Straw rammed the message home. </p> <p>There was a more aggressive side to the press campaign too. In September Handley had depicted himself as a Spartacus of the shires, a reasonable man pushed unwillingly to extreme action. It was essential to discredit him. </p> <p>Soon journalists came to hear, from concerned and anonnmous callers, about splits among the activists. Then came suggestions that Handley's business affairs might be worth looking at. One senior union official called him a 'latter-day Arthur Scargill'. A report detailing 180 alleged violent incidents directed at tanker drivers during the last protests was made public. Soon tabloid headlines were branding Handley a 'dangerous fool'. </p> <p>There was spin elsewhere too. Again and again spokesmen repeated that to cut fuel taxes would mean taking money from elsewhere. Predictably they said the money would come from the health service or pensioners. The storms battering the UK helped too. Global warming was highlighted as Ministers suddenly got very green. </p> <p>And, if the going does get tough, the Government has covered its flanks. </p> <p>The oil firms are well on board. During the first protests, when tanker drivers refused to cross picket lines, their relationship with Whitehall looked tense. Now they have pledged to Straw that they will do everything, without jeopardising drivers' safety, to get the tankers out. </p> <p>Essential services are now prepared - a clear contrast with last time. On 26 October, every NHS trust, local health authority, medical supply agency and the National Blood Service received a fax and email from Neil McKay, then the Acting Chief Executive of the NHS, suggesting they stockpile supplies and draw up contingency plans. </p> <p>Many petrol stations are storing three times as much fuel as usual. Thousands of companies and millions of individuals are taking their own precautions, buying storage tanks and jerry cans and filling up. Yesterday panic buying was continuing in southern England. The north was calmer, though there were problems in Liverpool. </p> <p>In the last resort the Government will use force. The policing of demonstrations will be far tougher than two months ago. Senior policemen say protesters are guilty of a criminal act even when just plotting to break the law. Pickets can be arrested for obstructing a public highway - as could slow-moving lorry drivers - or causing a breach of the peace. During the miners' strike pickets were prevented from travelling. 'There's no reason why we can't do the same now,' a former police officer and key government adviser said. Truckers have been warned that they face losing their operating licences if they break the law. </p> <p>And the Government has one last ace to play. A thousand soldiers are ready to drive tankers, more can drive trucks and several hundred men are trained to run the refineries. Between them they will ensure the fuel gets out. </p> <p>But the wild card is the public. The Government's control of public opinion is not as strong as it would like and opinion polls have shown support for the protesters is still high. There is a deep-seated conviction that the fuel tax - currently \u00a337 out of a \u00a350 fuel bill - is too high. There is a temptation to see deeper themes: the city against the country, the capital against the provinces, the urbanite Europhiles against those who have a very different view of what Britain is and should be. </p> <p>But, say academics, the emergence of a group of largely middle-class protesters signals the erosion of Britain's traditional class system rather than a reinforcement of divisions. New alignments are yet to be properly defined. </p> <p>Professor Rodney Barker, an expert on British civil disobedience at the London School of Economics, said: 'I could not have imagined this happening here 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. The fuel protesters may look like an anomaly, but they might well be a sign of things to come.'</p>",

I would like to go back to the beginning and ask you how you decided that you wanted to act, what made you choose that career path?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, I think the first time that I was ever on stage was when I was at St Mary's Academy boarding school in Windsor, Ontario, and I was six years old. And I guess it was a Christmas programme, and we did, you know, little nursery rhymes, and I was Little Miss Muffet, sitting on her tuffet. </p> <p>I remember my mother came to see the programme, and I just have this one image of being on stage, looking out into the blackness of the auditorium and not being able to see any faces, but knowing where my mother was - sensing her presence in a particular place. There are no thoughts or anything from that time, it was just that moment of looking out into the darkness and feeling my mother there. It was like something imprinted on my brain. It was like my destiny or something was established and any time I went on stage after that, I got that same kind of feeling.</p> <p>I remember my first audition in New York - I should actually tell you how I came to have an audition. It was kind of funny really, when I started working after I got out of school I was first a dancer, in night-clubs, and then a model, I modelled for several years in New York. Then when I was 23, I think, I said, 'All right. I've made up my mind, I want to be an actress. I want to do a Broadway play this fall. Does anybody know how I can get an audition?'.</p> <p>And it was, you know, innocent and foolish and probably a little stupid, except that someone did get me an audition and I did get the part. It was a lead on Broadway, and that's how I became an actress. But at the audition I remember going out on stage - the play was called Fair Game, and I was playing a model - and the audition scene was her first day in New York, having come from the midwest, to become a model. </p> <p>Just as I had come from the midwest, Detroit. So I got on stage, and I was at the Paramount theatre, and the director and the producer were up there, and I thought to myself, 'Well, here I am on my first day in my new apartment in New York, I remember what that was like'. And I was just about to begin and I said, 'OK. My first day, my first apartment. In New York. And I'm in it now'. </p> <p>Then this voice in my head said, 'No. You are on the stage in the Ethel Barrymore theatre, auditioning for your first Broadway play'. And I got so excited that it gave me everything I needed to play the scene. And I didn't realise it then, but I found out years later when I went to Lee Strasberg, that that's method acting. That it's using the truth of the situation to stimulate you to play the fiction. That's the kind of kernel of the technique. So, um, I don't know, but I think that my destiny was established in that one little moment, but I didn't really decide to do it until I was 23, or 24, I can't remember exactly. </p> <p>Later I realised, when I was reading a book called Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, by Suzuki, a Buddhist monk, that what I had done was what's called Beginner's Way - where you don't have enough information to do it wrong, so you just blunder in and do it right. And later, when you start learning a little bit about it you think, 'Oh dear. Maybe I shouldn't have done that'. And then you lose that ability to just do it. So that was when I started going to classes and taking acting lessons and learning how to do what I was bumbling into.</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> You mentioned Lee Strasberg, and you went to the Actor's Studio. Can you say a little bit about that experience, and what you think you drew from that.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, after that play I had a career. I was working on Broadway and on television and in radio. I went to Los Angeles - not because I wanted to, but because my husband dragged me there - [Laughter] - and I was working in television and I did some films, and my career was sort of advancing. And then I got a good part, a co-starring part, not a starring part, in a movie called Goodbye Charlie, with Debbie Reynolds and Walter Matthau and Tony Curtis. </p> <p>I was sitting on the set one day and I had been sort of assembled. I was wearing an old wig of Shirley MacLaine's and Debbie Reynolds' brother Bill painted my face in a way that I almost recognised and I had this lovely dress, and I felt kind of put together to fit this character. And I was sitting on the set, Vincente Minnelli was the director, and I looked around, it was at 20th Century Fox, and I said to myself, 'Alright. This is it. This is the big-time', the next step would be to play the Debbie Reynolds part. And that same voice that spoke to me at the audition said, 'I don't wannit.'</p> <p>And I was absolutely startled. There was no thought process that led up to it at that time that said I didn't like the path I was on. It was just at that moment. I knew I didn't like the way my career was developing... not just my career, but my talent. So when the film was over, I packed up my things and left California and went back to New York and met Lee and started his private classes. I didn't go straight into the Actor's Studio, I studied with Lee for several years before I auditioned for the Actors' Studio and got in - and working for him was one of the most important experiences of my life. </p> <p>I don't know how many of you have had the experience of being exposed to a master teacher, but it is one of the really profound things that can happen to you, because they don't just teach you about your art, whatever it is, but they teach you about how, as you develop in your art, you are developing your own humanity. </p> <p>When I first worked for Lee - I'll tell you the first exercise we did. It was to create, with your senses, a sense memory exercise, whatever you had for breakfast, a cup of tea or a cup of coffee, or whatever it was. And you had to pick up your cup and feel it and feel its weight and the heat of it and whatever you did. So I was doing my cup, my first exercise for Lee, and I saw him look at the cards in his hands with the names on them, and I could feel he was focused on me and I thought, 'Aaarrhh, here he comes'. Because he had penetrating vision, you know, he really saw. </p> <p>So after a while he said, 'Do you ride horses?' and when he comes out of leftfield like that you know you're really in trouble. So I said, 'Well, I used to.' And he said, 'Did you ride well?', and I said, 'Well. I had my own horse and I rode well at that time.' Then he said, 'Well, you don't have to ride that cup!'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>I was... shocked! I looked at him and thought, 'What?' He said, 'What if you made a mistake? Go on. Let me see you do it. Make a mistake.' And I started crying, and I cried for about two weeks. And I can't even say in logical terms what it was that transpired there, but he saw something in me that I wasn't aware of - that it had to be perfect. And only when I learnt how to relax that, and not to ride the cup, that to be in the moment in all of its imperfections, whatever that entails, was I able to begin to learn how to act. I hope that's meaningful to you!</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> Around about that time, when you were going through that process and your career was starting to take off, that period during the early 1970s we now tend to see as a very significant time for American cinema. A time when there was a sense of there being a new energy. Did it feel like that then?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, you know, I remember a couple of years ago reading something in a newspaper about the 'golden age' of cinema in the 1970s and I thought, 'Was it? I had no idea. Someone should have told us when we were doing it!' But it was a very fertile and fervent time in America. It was the time of the Vietnam war and the protests and everybody was very fired up - with LSD too - and Watergate, and all of the things that were going on at the time in the country. </p> <p>And we were all very active with this new energy. I think that somebody said once that only a small percentage of the population needs to do something like take LSD and everybody goes into an altered state. And I think that happened in America at that time. There was a sense that we were really contributing to culture and government and to what was happening. So I think that the cinema reflected that. I don't think that it was only happening in the cinema, but what was happening in the cinema was in the context of the time. <strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn1.ra\">Listen to the sound clip</a></strong> (1min 31)]</p> <p>I feel like that there is a return now to that time, and I give a lot of credit to Robert Redford for starting Sundance because he intentionally made it possible for there to be a place for young film-makers to develop. And it was after the 70s that the corporations came in and took over the cinema, and it stopped being an art form in America - not completely, of course, but to a large degree - and it was people making films, not because they like to make films, but because they like to make money with films. </p> <p>I think that Robert Redford, and all the people that came out of that movement and are in it now, are taking the art form back, away from the corporations and now making films like the Yards by James Gray and Requiem for a Dream by Darren Aronofsky. They are film-makers who really love films. When James Gray offered me the part in The Yards, it was such a low offer my agent asked for more money. </p> <p>The studio wouldn't change the budget, so James offered to pay the difference himself. When he did that, of course the studio came up with the rest of the money! And he didn't get much money himself, so there is a passion in film-makers today, which I am pleased to see because that means that there are roles for me again.</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> If we can go back a bit to The Last Picture Show, which was your first Academy Award nomination, for best supporting actress. Can you say a little about working on that film with Peter Bogdanovich?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, I'll tell you a couple of stories that come to mind. First, the audition. There were three parts in that film I could have played - Lois, Ruth and the waitress in the restaurant. When I was sent to read the script I was asked to read for the waitress. I went in to meet Peter and I told him that I was happy to read the waitress, but I really wanted to be Lois. He said, alright, read them both. And then he asked me to read Ruth too. </p> <p>So I read and he said, 'OK, you're in the movie. Now we just have to figure out what part you're gonna play!' He called me at home and said, 'Look. I know you wanna play Lois, but I have a couple of choices for her, and I don't have anyone to play Ruth, so I really need you to play that if I don't find someone.' So I said I would. And then he said, 'You know, that's the Academy Award part.' </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>He did! And I said, 'You know, I just don't want to play that type of character right now.' I was going through a divorce, I was very unhappy and I wanted to play a character who was a little more on top of it rather than beneath it. So, lucky for me, he found Cloris Leachman, and she did win the Academy Award, but I got to play the part that I wanted. The scene you saw [ Lois advising her teenage daughter not to marry her boyfriend as life would soon become monotonous and dull] because it was shot in a little bedroom, there was no room to put the camera to do a master shot. </p> <p>Normally you would do the whole scene and then break it up into small pieces. But I was moving around the room a lot and there was no room for the camera. So there was just one set-up for each line, and each line was in a different place, so there were 10 camera moves. So I had no, kind of, run at the scene. </p> <p>I would just go to one place and do one line, and then he would say 'cut' and then we'd move the camera to the next place and do the next line. So it was a bit tricky to get continuity in it, because I had to do the transition from one moment to the next at the beginning of each set-up. I had to remember what I had just said and do the transition. Which I did. </p> <p>When it was edited together Peter showed it to me, the film wasn't edited yet, but he said he wanted me to see this scene. So when the lights went up he said, 'Do you like it?', and I said, 'No.' And he said, 'Why not?' and I said, 'Well, you've cut off all my transitions.' And without stopping he turned to the editor and said, 'Put the heads and tails on each of those takes, will ya?' And he put them all back on and that was what he used. I was always very impressed with him for being able to do that.</p> <p>Oh. One other wonderful story. The first time that we all got together to read the script, we were in a hotel outside San Antonio. It was like a Holiday Inn on the freeway and just massively depressing.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>We all got together around a table in a low-ceilinged room, and we hadn't met before, none of us knew each other - we were all unknown at the time. As the reading went along this feeling in the room began to grow, like, 'Come on! What have we got here?' and I remember as we finished the last line and closed our scripts there was a pause, and then somebody said, 'You know. This could be a good movie!'</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> I wanted to ask you a little about The Exorcist. It is one of the roles you've been most widely seen in. It must have been very demanding - physically demanding, apart from anything else.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Yup! It took us nine months to shoot it, I've never done any other film that took so long. Six day weeks, twelve hour days for nine months, it was really very, very stressful. And difficult in so many ways. Emotional heights that had to be hit and then sustained. </p> <p>When you do a master shot you have to hold on to what you've just done while they reset everything for the close-ups and I remember I had, because it was 1973, a big headset that was a radio and I would put that on so I could listen to some music and turn my chair to the wall to help keep me in whatever mood we had just established. </p> <p>So it seems to me that one of my main memories of that film was looking at a wall, listening to music. Because it was quite difficult to maintain that level of terror for so many hours and days and weeks and months. It was a big event in my life. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn2.ra\">Listen to the sound clip</a></strong> (1min 47) ]</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> Let's talk about Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. You won an Academy Award and a Bafta, and also it seems as though that was a very personal film that you were committed to getting made.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, while I was shooting The Exorcist, Warner Brothers was the studio and John Kelly was the executive. John was looking in the dailies every day back in Los Angeles - we were in New York and Washington - and he decided that he wanted to do another film with me, so he started sending me scripts. Now at that time, 1973, it was early in the woman's movement and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different. </p> <p>With that in mind, and what was happening to me and my own consciousness, as I looked at the scripts they all reflected the 'old position' of women. They were either victims, dutiful wives or prostitutes, or... well, that was pretty much it. I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognised, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, the script by Bob Getchell. </p> <p>When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said to look at a movie called Mean Streets, which hadn't been released yet. </p> <p>So I looked at it and I felt that it was exactly what the script of Alice needed, because Alice was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know - in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day-Rock Hudson kind of way. I wanted something a bit more gritty. </p> <p>When I saw Mean Streets I felt that Martin [Scorsese] was the person who could do it. So I asked to meet him and he came to John Kelly's office - this very small, nervous little guy, he was very young then - and I told him how much I liked the film but I said, 'You know, it's hard to tell from that film what you know about women. Do you know anything about women?' and he said, 'No. But I'd like to learn!' So we went to work together and it was just one of the best experiences I've ever had. Marty has a way of providing a creative atmosphere on the set wherein the actors can do what they know how to do best. </p> <p>So the script is basically how Getchell wrote it, but with a lot of improvisation in rehearsal and a lot was added to it from our own lives. And a lot from my relationship with my son at that time worked its way into the film. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn3.ra\">Listen to the sound clip</a></strong> (3mins 01) ]</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> That was something I wanted to ask you. What leaps of the screen is that incredible relationship you have between you and Alfred Lutter, who plays your son. I was interested in how you worked to get that.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, a lot of the things... well, I'm embarrassed to say that the clip you saw [ when Alice orders her son to write down all the bad things in his life on a piece of paper] actually happened between me and my son when I was at my wits' end. When I look at it now I think, 'God, I was being rather rough with that boy!' </p> <p>Alfred Lutter was a very bright boy, very bright and very bratty. He was very in the moment and very fine to work with. My son was on the set too, and he played the boy next door. And he wasn't a great fan of Alfred Lutter, actually. So there was a kind of feedback between the script and my life. </p> <p> <a href=\"/Film/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,393617,00.html\">To next page</a></p> <p><strong>Sound clips</strong></p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn1.ra\">On the 'golden age' of cinema in the 1970s</a> (1min 31) <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn2.ra\">Working on The Exorcist</a> (1min 47) <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn3.ra\">The genesis of Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore</a> (1min 01) <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn4.ra\">Working currently with young directors</a> (2mins 18) <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn5.ra\">The physical hardships of shooting Requiem for a Dream</a> (3mins 22) <br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn6.ra\">On the roles for which she is best known, and the new version of The Exorcist</a> (1min 17)</p>",
  "<p>For anybody visiting Equitable Life's website, the home page has plenty to attract the eye: buy an Isa; get ready for stakeholder pensions; manage your Equitable investments online; or find out about the company's sponsorship of Mid dlesex County Cricket Club. The only thing missing is a huge 'For sale' banner across the top of the page to remind investors that the country's oldest mutual insurer is sitting on the auction block, waiting for a new owner to rescue it from financial Armageddon. </p> <p>Equitable took the unusual step of publicly declaring itself for sale in July after a disastrous court case in which the Law Lords ruled that it had short-changed pension policyholders who had opted for a guaranteed minimum annuity rate. The company was left with an estimated \u00a31.5 billion black hole to fill, and with little held in reserve - the result of a practice of making the maximum distribution to policyholders - it has been forced to look for a buyer to inject new funds. </p> <p>Change of ownership will not take place until next year, after those policyholders who effectively own the mutual have given their approval, and in the meantime customers face a prolonged period of uncertainty. That raises a number of questions: should existing policyholders hang on, particularly those whose pensions must come out of the same with-profits pot as the guaranteed annuity policyholders, and who will there fore bear the cost of their superior returns? And should anyone in their right mind be taking out a new policy with Equitable before the dust has settled? </p> <p>Equitable clearly hopes that its difficulties will not dissuade new customers from signing up. Recent advertising emphasises the company's traditional virtues such as its low charges, as well as some of the investment awards it has won. The line about the benefits of mutuality, peddled by wrinkly fiftysomething John Peel earlier in the year, has been quietly put on the backburner. </p> <p>But financial advisers are not so sure. Brian Philpott, a director of independent financial adviser Annuity Direct, says: 'As an IFA, we are very much required by our regulators to put forward companies that are financially secure. The main benchmark we would use to establish financial security is the free -sset ratio and, in the case of Equitable Life, it is difficult to see how we could make a case for supporting the company.' </p> <p>The free-asset ratio measures the extent to which assets exceed liabilities such as declared bonuses, death benefits and annuity guarantees. A normal figure in the life industry is around 20-25 per cent, but at the latest count Equitable had a free-asset ratio of just 5 per cent. </p> <p>Ken Mills, a director of IFA Greig Middleton Financial Services, goes further. 'You should definitely wait to see who is going to buy it, how strong it is going to be, and what are the future prospects before you start a new policy,' he says. 'The weaker you are judged to be, the more you are required to put into gilts, and so that means your future bonuses are likely to be weakened.' </p> <p>Some people could be tempted to take out an Equitable Life policy in the hope of receiving a windfall when the insurer is taken over. Mills thinks that may prove a forlorn hope. Equitable Life suspended bonuses on all its with-profits policies for the first half of this year, and the first priority of a buyer, he says, will be to replenish those bonuses as well as bridge the shortfall that will be caused by increased future payments to guaranteed annuity policyholders. </p> <p>As yet, nobody has an accurate picture of the size of the shortfall or of the price Equitable will attract when it is taken over. </p> <p>For existing policyholders, the advice is to stay put until these issues have been resolved. Although those who have taken out a pension in the last couple of years may be tempted to opt for a transfer, they would be wise to hang around and see whether the situation is greatly improved under new ownership. </p> <p>Making an exit from just about any kind of pension or endowment policy before maturity almost invariably carries a penalty; in the case of with-profits pensions, as much as 25 per cent of the policy's eventual value usually comes from the terminal bonus that is paid at maturity. </p> <p>Equitable is likely to find its marketing efforts falling on stony ground until its future is decided. And while the recriminations are set to run and run, policyholders will be no less anxious to see its financial equilibrium restored.</p> <p><strong>Soothing sermons anger viewers</strong></p> <p>Advertising by beleaguered insurer Equitable Life has caused offence to some newspaper readers and television viewers. </p> <p>Equitable has continued to advertise despite the \u00a31.5 billion liability it has had to meet to honour pension guarantees and the uncertainty over its future ownership. The television advertisements featured broadcaster John Peel and actress Amanda Burton delivering soothing sermons on Equitable pensions.</p> <p>The Independent Television Commission, the commercial television regulator, said a complainant had questioned why the insurer should be advertising. No judgment has been issued but a complaint of this type - questioning the organisation's right to continue advertising, rather than an advertisement - would not normally be upheld.</p> <p>The Advertising Standards Authority, which deals with press advertising, received a complaint, but this was referred to the Financial Services Authority because it was a general complaint about whether the company could meet its commitments to policyholders.</p> <p>A further complaint was made to the ASA last week by retired actuary Ronnie Sloan about a press advertisement by Equitable. He objected to the way Equitable had used information about two awards it received for its pensions. One was by readers of The Observer , and sister publications the Guardian and Money Observer . Sloan complained that The Observer awards were made before the result of the Court case. He also points out that articles accompanying publication of the award said a court case was pending. Sloan complained that the second awards from Money Management magazine were based on performance figures that preceded the court decision and were based on unit-linked investments, not with-profits, 'despite the advert referring both to unit-linked and with-profits funds'.</p> <p>Alistair Dunbar, of Equitable Life, said he believed that readers of The Observer and Guardian would have known about the court case when they voted. He added: 'We are an ongoing business continuing to advertise, market and sell our range of attractive products. Of 19 [investment] funds one is with profits. There is no selling off the page. In any conversation with prospective clients our salesmen make the situation concerning the sales of the society clear, up front.'</p>",
  "People will forgive - at any rate, they take for granted - many sins by government. Mendacity, laziness, dullness, a certain amount of incompetence and sleaziness, these are anticipated misdemeanours. There is one transgression for which the punishment meted out by the electorate is always capital. Losing control: that is the crime which most often costs a Prime Minister his head when the vengeful voter uses the ballot box as the block. <p>Dictator is the complaint against most of those who inhabit Number 10, but it is the reverse that the country holds in most unquenchable contempt. Nothing smashes belief in a Prime Minister so much as the destruction of public confidence in his capacity to govern. </p> <p>That is why this coming week is so critical for Tony Blair. Images of chaos already swirl around the storm drains of Downing Street and surge up to the sandbagged door of Number 10: panic at the pumps, trains off the rails, Britain under water. It never rains; it floods. Mr Blair, who is a keener student of history than he is usually given credit for, will appreciate the consequences if these rising and spume-flecked waters close over his head. His premiership will be sunk. </p> <p>Drowning can happen to a Prime Minister in the span of a day. The last tenant of Number 10 never recovered from sterling's humiliating ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. That Black Wednesday, when John Major's Cabinet was reduced to a bunch of mutes at their own funeral, was scorched into the national memory with a fatal indelibility. It was the trashing of central London by rioters against the poll tax that put Margaret Thatcher on the trajectory to defenestration by her own frightened MPs. </p> <p>The rats snouting through the piles of uncleared rubbish in Leicester Square during the Winter of Discontent gnawed the guts out of the premiership of Jim Callaghan. The miners and the three- day week impelled Ted Heath to call an election in which he asked: 'Who governs?' The country briskly replied that, if he needed to ask the question, then the answer shouldn't be Mr Heath. </p> <p>This break point has not happened to Tony Blair - not yet. In September, he came so terrifyingly close to bust that Ministers shiver at memories of the fuel blockade that brought the country to within 48 hours of anarchy. Had petrol supplies been throttled for just two more days, the headlines - assuming there were newspapers available in which to read them - would have spoken of middle-class housewives wrestling in the aisles of supermarkets for the last baguette, and middle-aged business executives bludgeoning each other with car jacks for jerry cans of petrol. B</p> <p>ritain lurched to the lip of mass hysteria and, quite possibly, many deaths. Whoever you blame, the Government would have been held responsible. That was the abyss into which the Prime Minister stared. At his darkest hour, he turned to one of his closest associates and said: 'This could cost us the election.' </p> <p>As they assemble their defences for the moment of truth with the fuel protesters, the Government is still trying to dissect why last time they were caught so naked. During a recent conversation with a relevant Minister, I expressed some amazement that no Whitehall contingency unit had raised the alarm when petrol supplies began to run dangerously low. </p> <p>The Minister laughed incredulously. 'What you have to understand, Andrew, what your starting point should be, is the uselessness of the civil service.' He banged the table and waxed industrial in his language as he warmed to the theme, a lament you increasingly hear from many different Ministers across the Government, about how foolish it was to invest any faith in the reliability of the machinery of the state. </p> <p>From Tony Blair downwards, they are not as confident as they sound in public that this time everything will turn out all right. Ministers approach the point of potential combustion believing they are much better prepared for the blockaders, but knowing they are still taking an enormous gamble on the Government's authority. </p> <p>The plan is to play hard cop/soft cop. First, Jack Straw slams the fuel protesters in the kidneys, threatening them with dire consequences if they refuse to come along quietly. Then, this week, Gordon Brown administers the sweet tea and sugared biscuits in his mini-Budget. The Chancellor would be crazy to cut fuel duty, which would be bad for the environment and worse for the Government. </p> <p>A small cut will be scorned as derisory; a reduction in duty of the magnitude being demanded will be an abject defeat. Victory for the fuel wreckers, and their arrogantly dictated 60-day deadline to an elected government, will incite every pressure group with a noisy grudge to press a pistol to the Prime Minister's temples. There will, of course, be palliatives to draw the sting of the anger about petrol prices, but what the Chancellor announces must not add up to appeasement. Number 10 does not want to be reading the word 'surrender' on any of Thursday morning's front pages. </p> <p>They believe they have had some success decoupling the protesters from the public. Sentiment has turned against David Handley, the self-described 'cornered rat', his self-styled 'People's Fuel Lobby' and their self-centred fellow truckers. The Government has made a better fist of articulating the price of giving way to blackmail. Those sections of the press which previously urged the protesters to the brink of lawlessness are warning them off renewed action against refineries. The cause has only one remaining press champion in the Daily Telegraph, the Blockaders' Gazette. </p> <p>The Tories are in a typical tangle born of characteristic opportunism. William Hague originally seized on these 'upstanding citizens' as the shock yeomanry of an anti-government revolt. The Tory leader, suddenly remembering that his party is still supposed to believe in the rule of law and the maintenance of order, is now running as fast as his little legs can carry him to put distance between himself and the militants. </p> <p>The protesters have brought derision upon themselves, not least by the risible attempt to claim comparison between their crawl down the M1 and the Jarrow marchers. Those were unemployed men with starving families who peacefully walked to London. These are subsidy-stuffed farmers and thick-girthed hauliers attempting to inflict massive disruption. You have to ask: if they really are as impecunious as they claim to be, how can they afford to stage this noxious stunt? </p> <p>There is a lively argument within the Government about how much crack there should be in the crackdown. Everyone is agreed that fuel has to flow. Intimidation of tanker drivers must be stamped on quickly and vigorously. After so much rigid rhetoric from the Home Secretary, the macho of Jack Straw will not mean mucho if the police response is as lethargic as it was eight weeks ago. </p> <p>The robustness promised by Martial Straw brings with it hazards. While it may frighten off some of the protesters, there is the risk of provoking the hard core to be more obdurate and more extreme. Some Ministers are fearful of ugly, even blood-stained confrontations if the police start to arrest the road jammers and impound their lorries. </p> <p>It is a call that the Government must not get wrong. Public and press opinion - as unpredictable to Number 10 as they are scary - could again swing against the Government and do so violently. This pivotal moment for Tony Blair will define his premiership for better or worse. His Government cannot afford to be beaten and they know it. While the right hand clenches around the brandished stick, the left hand twitches behind the back, fingers nervously crossed.</p>",
  "<p>My wife would kill me if she knew what I was doing to that blonde, but I don't see how I can vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton. My vote against her in the New York Senate race could put Republican bats in charge of Congress and the White House, where they are certain to suck the blood of the working class - by privatising social security. </p> <p>Yet I hesitate about Hillary. It all goes back to something Ron Brown, the late Commerce Secretary, said about our dear First Lady: 'I'm not Hillary's mother-f***ing tour guide.' </p> <p>To know what that's all about, turn back to Arkansas 1976, when Bill Clinton won election to the powerful state post of Attorney General. I hunted down Clinton's old ally Zack Polatt, of Little Rock, to talk about those glory days. </p> <p>Clinton ran his campaign on fighting the despised local electricity company, Arkansas Power. Funny thing was, Polatt told me, Arkansas consumer organisations were defeated in court by the power company's sharp lawyers, Webster Hubbell and Hillary Rodham of Rose Law. </p> <p>At the time, Hillary would not use her husband's name. She strategically switched to 'Mrs Clinton' only while crying crocodile tears for the oppressed. The official biography of the 'Flotus' (government-speak for First Lady of the United States) lists her six-month stint on a child-protection task force. Yet nowhere does it mention her six years on the board of Wal-Mart Corporation, notorious during her directorship for alleged abuses of child labour. Sam Walton called her 'My little lady' and paid her fees equal to 60 per cent of her income as a lawyer. </p> <p>Fast forward to 1994 and the Brown 'tour guide' business. According to Nolanda Hill, the Commerce Secretary's long-time business partner and love interest, Brown, who died in 1996, endorsed a Hillary cash-for-access scheme ($10,000 for coffee with the President, $100,000 for a night in the Lincoln bedroom), but resented the discount rate the Flotus put on US executives joining his lucrative trade missions. 'I'm worth more than $50,000 a pop!' </p> <p>A reflection of the Brown-Hillary scheme is visible in a document The Observer obtained through the US Freedom of Information Act, dated June 1994. In the memo, Jude Kearney, Commerce Department officer (and Clinton chum from Arkansas) warned someone called 'JCB' of power company Entergy that his employer would be locked out of Brown's upcoming China mission unlessit was 'politically connected'. </p> <p>By the end of the month, Entergy, whose partner in the China venture was the Riady family of Indonesia, would connect big time to both Flotus and 'Potus' (the President) and get its spot on the China mission, on which it signed a billion-dollar deal with the Chinese. </p> <p>On 27 June James Riady paid Webster Hubbell, Hillary's former law partner, $100,000. How strange. Hubbell was under indictment for fraudulently inflating his legal bills, a felony. I've conducted investigations of lawyer overbilling. How can one law partner to fake detailed time logs without the complicity of another lawyer in the firm? Hillary's logs were worth close inspection by authorities. </p> <p>Funny thing about Hillary's billing records: when requested for disclosure in an unrelated matter they disappeared. First, her law firm's computers went ka-blooey. Then the paper printouts vanished, but not before, during the 1992 Presidential campaign, they were secretly combed over, line by line, by two of her partners, Vince Foster and Web Hubbell. </p> <p>Hubbell knew his own logs were phonied, and he understood the consequences of exposure. Ultimately, bloated hours on those records caused him to lose his law licence, his ministerial post (the President had appointed him Assistant US Attorney General) and his freedom - 21 months in the slammer. </p> <p>What did Foster and Hubbell see and know about Hillary's logs? Hubbell won't say, except for a cryptic remark, after seeing her bills, that 'every lawyer' fabricates records. Hubbell pleaded guilty, but refused to answer investigators' questions, a requirement in any plea bargain, so the judge had to sentence him to prison. </p> <p>Why would Hubbell choose to do time on the chain gang over testifying about the Flotus? His prosecutors did not know at the time of a $100,000 Riady payment, the first of over half a million dollars Hubbell would receive from Clinton friends in the weeks up to his entering jail. </p> <p>Foster didn't speak either - and now he can't. Hubbell, a jovial good ol' boy, had the temperament to suffer a brush with ruin with a grin... and wait for friends of Bill and Hill to stuff his piggy bank. Foster, who Clinton made a White House counsel, had a less flexible personality. On 20 July, 1993, as Rose Law fake billings were about to become public, Foster committed suicide. </p> <p>Files of the Flotus were removed from Foster's White House office prior to the arrival of the FBI. Her billing records reappeared two years later just outside her office, right after Hubbell's refusal to testify against her. </p> <p>By overbilling, Hubbell admits he stole from his partners and clients. Some sued Hubbell, but the Flotus did not. Imagine: Hillary, a supposed victim of the overbilling scam not only refused to sue the thief who cheated her, she helped make him wealthy on his way to prison. The lady's a saint, unless - and I'd never believe this - she was in on Hubbell's scam. </p> <p>Maybe the Clintons knew nothing about the big money flowing to prison-bound Hubbell. Knowledge of the payments would suggest they were buying Hubbell's silence. In 1996, when the LA Times uncovered the payments, the President stone-cold denied he knew anything about it. </p> <p>Then, this past April, in a deposition by the Justice Department weirdly unreported by the US press, Clinton changed his tune. Investigators confronted the President with this: on 20 June 1994, Hubbell met with the Flotus. Two days later, James Riady met with Hubbell for breakfast, then went to the White House, met again with Hubbell, then made two more treks to the White House. Two days later, a videotape shows the beginning of a meeting in the Oval Office between Clinton and Riady before the tape goes blank. Two days after that, Hubbell gets his $100,000 through a Riady bank. </p> <p>Lying to journalists is a venal sin, but lying to the Feds is perjury. In his deposition, the President's denial transformed into amnesia. He couldn't remember if Riady mentioned the payment. Then, the President slyly opened the door to the truth. 'I wouldn't be surprised if James told me,' Clinton said. Neither would I. </p> <p>Riady said other surprising things to Clinton. According to FBI debriefing papers, on 14 August 1992 the Indonesian billionaire, riding with candidate Clinton in a limousine, promised to give $1 million to Clinton's campaign. Riady made good on his promise through sham donors, a violation of US laws against concealed and foreign donations. </p> <p>What did Riady get? The Flotus herself, says Nolanda Hill, forced Brown to accept the appointment of Riady's bag man, John Huang, as a Commerce Department deputy. Huang's first order of business was to wheedle his way into confidential CIA briefings on Indonesia and China, then call Riady and his Entergy partners. </p> <p>The very day Riady met the President, diaries show he called on a Clinton crony at the top of the department's Export-Import Bank. 'We just came over from the Oval Office,' is a nice way to provide assurance of the 'political connection' required for help. These and other Riady team meetings at Commerce are marked 'social'. Yet, shortly thereafter, the department agreed to promote and fund the Riady-Entergy China venture. </p> <p>Influence is not a victimless crime. Riady and his minions' visits to the White House (94 times!) included successful requests for the President to meet Indonesian dictator Suharto and to kill negative reports on East Timor and working conditions in Indonesia. Timorese and Indonesians paid for these policy flips with blood. </p> <p>As a loyal Democrat, I will never accept that the $1m slipped to the Clinton campaign and the cash for Hillary's tight-lipped partner Hubbell connect in any way with Clinton administration actions - no matter what the evidence says. But it does shake my belief in the Flotus. </p> <p>Which leaves me with her Republican opponent, Congressman Rick Lazio, the disarming young man with the little-boy grin. Little Ricky, whom I remember trying to sabotage a government racketeering case. Ricky the Rat? Forget it. </p> <p>So, Hillary, I'm back, flowers and vote in hand. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@observer.co.uk\">gregory.palast@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>America's Queen: The Life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis </strong><br>Sarah Bradford<br>Viking \u00a320, pp690<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501841486,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> If Diana, Princess of Wales, had not died with Dodi al Fayed in that terrible Paris car crash, I wonder how she would be regarded today. What if she and Dodi had got married? Would we still accept her as the 'queen of our hearts' if she were now the daughter-in-law of the absurd proprietor of Harrods? As it is, the tragedy has made such questions redundant. Her status as a national icon - the beautiful, warm-hearted, exploited princess, the ideal queen who has been denied us - is likely to remain secure. </p> <p>Tragedy made Jacqueline Kennedy an icon too - a far greater icon than Diana - but the tragedy in her case was the death of her husband, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. She had 30 more years to live after his assassination in Dallas in 1963, and during that time she horrified the world, and especially the Kennedy clan, by marrying the monstrous, bullying Greek shipping billionaire, Aristotle Onassis. </p> <p>But even this failed to knock her off her pedestal, for she never forfeited the adulation of her fellow Americans. She remained fixed forever in their imaginations as the 'marble' widow at Kennedy's funeral, a grieving heroine who, as Sarah Bradford puts it, 'restored America's pride', exorcising the shame of the killing of the thirty-fifth President and becoming, in Frank Sinatra's words, 'America's queen'. </p> <p>This was not entirely ordained by fate. Despite the strain of being married to a serial adulterer, Jackie Kennedy was a ruthless promoter of the Kennedy image while her husband was alive, and its ferocious custodian until her death in 1994. She regarded loyalty as the paramount virtue and anyone, even among her husband's greatest admirers, who went even the tiniest bit 'off message', as we would say now, would be brutally ejected from her circle, often never to be readmitted. </p> <p>She was fully aware of her power as a national icon and once told the historian William Manchester, when she was trying to censor his official account of the assassination, that she was bound to win the argument because 'anybody who is against me will look like a rat unless I run off with Eddie Fisher'. (This was before she ran off with Onassis.) </p> <p>Fiercely protective of her privacy, and commendably determined to bring up her two children, Caroline and John Jnr in as normal a way as possible in the most difficult circumstances, she was deeply suspicious of the press and extremely haughty towards it. Helen Thomas, a White House reporter, told Bradford that she 'treated the press like so many foreign invaders'. Once, when Jackie arrived back in Washington from Hyannis Port, the Kennedy home in Massachusetts, bearing a puppy given her as a birthday present by her father-in-law, Ambassador Joe Kennedy, the press sent her a note asking what she would feed it. She replied with one word: 'Reporters.' </p> <p>But the press played her game, perhaps because it knew the public would never stomach the truth. Not until several years after JFK's death did the public hear anything about his addiction to sex ('I swear to you, and this is absolutely true, at this point it was chicer not to have slept with the President than to have slept with him,' said one New York society debutante), his dependence on amphetamines for his agonising back pain, or his father's links with the Chicago mafia. </p> <p>If Jackie could tolerate her husband's infidelities and take part in the conspiracy to conceal them from the world, this may have been because her father, the handsome, drunken wastrel John Vernou Bouvier III - 'Black Jack', as he was called - was at least as bad. She adored him and was proud of his success with women, while he, in turn, warned her that 'all men are rats'. </p> <p>She was conditioned by her family background to gravitate instinctively towards powerful, dominant men and, especially, very rich ones. She was obsessed with money, which she saw as the key to security and independence, and would never have married anyone less than a multi-millionaire. She was, Bradford frequently tells us, the ultimate American geisha. </p> <p>This consummate myth-maker was brought up on a myth - that the Bouviers were descended from the highest nobility of France. Despite indisputable evidence that they were descended from lowly French shopkeepers, the family stuck to its story. Jackie may also have been influenced by a remark of her father-in-law during Jack's election campaign that 'It's not about what you are, it's about what people think you are'. Image was on JFK's mind to the end. His last words to his wife on that fateful car ride through Dallas were: 'Take off the glasses, Jackie.' </p> <p>In this highly readable, if too long and sometimes repetitious, account of her life, Bradford brings out Jackie's appealing qualities - her intelligence, curiosity and sense of fun, as well as her selfless devotion to her children and her extraordinary courage. But the real Jackie remains concealed behind the protective shell with which she surrounded herself since childhood to keep an ugly and dangerous world at bay. </p> <p>As First Lady, she was no Hillary Clinton. She had little interest in and no influence over policy. To the White House, she contributed nothing practical except the taste of a cultivated society woman in its hugely expensive refurbishment. But she invented and nurtured the Camelot myth that still enthrals the world, and that was hardly a small achievement.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Beethoven's Hair: an Extraordinary Historical Odyssey and a Musical Mystery Solved</strong><br>Russell Martin<br>Bloomsbury \u00a314.99, pp256<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000094368,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>So singular this author's prose style that I had to consult the dust-jacket to find out if English (or American English) is his native language. It is. Since he was reportedly paid a six-figure sum to write this book about a peripatetic lock of Beethoven's hair, it is worth paying close attention to learn the secrets of his technique. The following sentence is typical: 'Utterly unmentioned throughout the three decades since she had joined the Fremming family, the hair and the black locket that contained it simply had lain in a drawer in the doctor's desk.' </p> <p>Fortunately, the writer has taken the trouble not to utterly unmention his editor by name, so we know whom to thank for this not unarresting ungracefulness which crashes across the page every few lines. Composite adjectives play havoc with syntax: Prince Razumovsky is 'battered by the bottomed-out economy' and Beethoven suffers from 'long-battered health', while the 'surely fear-racked owner' of the lock of hair goes missing once the Second World War 'dramatically was under way'. </p> <p>In general, however, the author adds rather than subtracts. Verbal frills adorn each phrase like decorous doilies. People 'opine', events 'commence', Beethoven 'employs' paper and 'pens' a letter. Bathos is raised to a high art. Beethoven's life is 'laced with enormous accomplishments'. His mother's death 'was a terrible blow to the whole family'. The news that the Germans had surrendered in 1945 is 'stupendous'. </p> <p>If the syntax is clotted, the story itself is painfully etiolated, stretched thin over more than 250 pages where a third as many would do. Without index, reference, footnote or bibliography, fact and guesswork are indistinguishable. The reader skates blindly, longing for a safety rail on which to cling but finding only a red herring hanging at the end of a line. The bald facts, repeated with maddening monotony, concern a clump of hair said to have been snipped from Beethoven's head at the time of his death by an acolyte, Ferdinand Hiller. </p> <p>Passed from father to son, this hair apparent eventually turned up in Denmark in 1943 during the Nazi occupation, handed to a Danish doctor by an unknown Jewish refugee he had helped to safety. The author brings events up to date with its sale (at Sotheby's in 1994) to two Americans, a collector and a urologist, who respectively bear the stunningly improbable names of Ira Brilliant and 'Che' Guevara. </p> <p>A parallel tale relates the scientific examination of samples of the hair, and the resultant conclusions as to Beethoven's state of health - not too good by all accounts: inflamed bowels, nose bleeds, frequent vomiting, swollen abdomen, jaundice, pneumonia and liver failure. </p> <p>Despite the book's subtitle, music doesn't feature, except as a background list, interspersed as a third narrative, of the composer's 'enormous accomplishments'. The absence of morphine in Beethoven's raped lock and the presence, instead, of lead - the chief findings of the scientists' tests - is of circumstantial rather than musical interest. Would they have known from this trichonometry the more relevant fact that Beethoven was deaf? </p> <p>Much is made of the discovery that he wrote his final works racked with pain rather than soothed with sedative. Our ears tell us that already, but who are we to split such trivial hairs?</p>",
  "<p><strong>Marquis de Sade: Letters From Prison</strong><br>translated by Richard Seaver<br>Harvill \u00a320, pp402</p> <p>In advance of the forthcoming film Quills, in which a leering Geoffrey Rush overplays the incarcerated sodomite, this is the definitive collection of Sade's correspondence. It is notable primarily for its lack of carnal interest. The letters are written from the dungeons of Vincennes and the Bastille, and from the asylum of Charenton in which he was held, on charges of 'offence against the morals of the kingdom' from 1777 for 13 years, until he was 50. Most are directed to his wife: lugubrious, impassioned, self-absorbed entreaties for her to be more attendant on his every sacrosanct whim. </p> <p>In one, for example, he requests a shopping list of absolute essentials to make his stay in his subterranean cell more bearable: 'Two dozen meringues and two dozen lemon cakes from the Palais Royal pastry shop; the architectural plans for the new Italian Opera in Paris; a dark green jacket, with a silk fringe, with or without silver, the size being the same as the one the tailor sent me a fortnight ago; some chocolate; and a little dog, preferably a pup, so that I may have the pleasure of raising it, either a spaniel or a setter...' </p> <p>Otherwise, he uses his apparently unlimited quotas of paper and ink to harangue his mother-in-law, Madame de Montreuil, who initially turned him in while he was attendant on his own mother's deathbed: 'Remember, Madame, that you will never derive any good from making my soul more savage and my heart more immune to feeling, the only possible results of the frightful state to which you have had me put.' </p> <p>As if to prove the point, Sade, never a man to stand on ceremony, in prison conceived of the works which made his name, and destroyed that of his family: Justine, Juliette and Philosophy in the Bedroom. Apollinaire once called him, somewhat grandly, 'the freest soul who ever lived' and, in chains, he let his imagination run riot, counting himself lord of infinite space.</p> <p>His letters, however, make scant mention of his literary or libidinous ambitions and are evidence more of his place within what he called 'an age of total corruption'. There are, thus, plea bargains for manservants and ever more urgent demands for oculists as his eyesight fails by candlelight; moreover, he employs every rhetorical device at his disposal in a vain effort to use family influence to hasten his release. </p> <p>When this liberation is not forthcoming the letters seem to become a vehicle of his enforced impotence - 'I am most assuredly not incapable of writing you,' he explains to his long-suffering wife at one point (as if she were in any doubt), 'and the day I am, for fear of worrying you, knowing how you feel about me, I shall manage so well that you won't even notice it.' </p> <p>At least, in them, he appears to sublimate his sexual frustrations into his sentence construction, which is often engorged and always tortured.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hans Christian Andersen: The LIfe of a Storyteller</strong><br>Jackie Wullschlager<br>Allen Lane/ The Penguin Press \u00a320, pp506<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501840350,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>The Harry Potter phenomenon, coming after Tolkien, sets off many chimes. The thirst for fairy-tales and allegories, for the domestication of the supernatural, looks to be universal. It is incised in the child and in the fertile mysteries of childhood as these survive in adult men and women.</p> <p>Fairy-tales join hands across time and space, across cultures and languages. The Argonauts become intergalactic warriors; Cinderella darkens into the fable of the three daughters in King Lear; a thousand tales of 'impossible' tasks to perform echo back to the labours of Hercules. Surrealism and science-fiction are derivative from the unrealities, consoling or menacing, of fairyland. Sirens and mermaids sing the great seas of our dreams, themselves voyages, from Homer to Walcott. </p> <p>This universality, this compelling mixture of 'childishness' and enigmatic depths, of laughter and desolation, has long intrigued psychologists. Freud analysed fairy-tales, seeking to unriddle in their spell the suppressed impulses of childhood traumas and nascent sexuality. </p> <p>Jung probed deeper, perceiving in their ubiquity, in the shocks of recognition they bring to us, certain archetypes of the human psyche, certain universal configurations of narrative which are remembered subconsciously and collectively. Like no other mental pattern, the fairy-tale, the metamorphosis of beauty into beast, of pauper into prince, leads us back, like the 'background noise' in modern cosmology, to the origins of the human psyche. </p> <p>The iceberg mass of the world's fairy-tales is anonymous. It arises from sources and occasions, from reveries and metaphoric imaginings innocent of authorship. The elves and imps, the talking animals and witches, the lost children and foundlings which people the landscapes of even the earliest cultures, come late. Millennia of animate shadows precede them. And even at his most inventive, the known, modern master of the genre will draw heavily on the shared inventory, on the global conventions of the genre. Charles Perrault's 'Mother Goose' or 'Puss-in-Boots' draw on a dense layer of folk-tales. </p> <p>The brothers Grimm are inspired collectors of German folk-lore, of tales festive and horrific which had been told and embroidered upon at the fire-side for centuries. The 'invention' of any fundamental motif, of a story that will enter and remain in our common remembrance, is exceedingly rare (if it exists at all). No one came closer to that magical turn than did Hans Christian Andersen. </p> <p>As Jackie Wullschlager shows in her finely documented and insightful biography, so much in Andersen's life had its direct reflection in his inspired fancies. His childhood was one of frequent misery. </p> <p>Seeking employment as a playwright or actor, the 'ugly duckling', during 1820-1822, hung on in Copenhagen virtually starving. Nothing in his harrowed personality seemed to give grounds for hope, except a nascent genius for friendship and the occasional stroke of luck out of the blue, precisely as in fairy-tales. </p> <p>Recognition came almost overnight with the publication, in the mid-1830s, of Andersen's first masterpieces. He was, before long, a European celebrity, the recipient of a royal annuity, the object of caring generosity among wealthy friends and patrons. But no measure of literary glory and material reward could ever efface the deep scars left by Andersen's early years, by the humiliations in his background (his aunt ran a brothel) and by the disappointments which attached to the manifest failings of his 'serious' fiction. Only a master of pain could have written the secret sufferings of 'The Little Mermaid'. </p> <p>As has no previous biographer, notably in Denmark, Wullschlager tackles the absolutely crucial but opaque question of Hans Christian Andersen's sexuality. She does so with unfailing tact and a salutary resistance to psychoanalytic facilities. Andersen made no secret of infatuations with women, notably with the great singer, Jenny Lind. Landed and aristocratic ladies drew his adoring gaze. There is, however, no proof that he experienced heterosexual relations, not even during his visits to prostitutes late in his life. </p> <p>The fundamental homoeroticism, on the other hand, is manifest from the outset. It generated passionate longings for a number of male friends, for a prince of the German imperial house, for a bevy of younger male travelling companions. Ardent letters and kisses abound. 'Do not judge me by ordinary standards,' pleaded Andersen, in a social climate all but closed to open homosexuality (yet rife with its practice). Yet again, there is no convincing evidence of consummation. Only of aching need and rhetoric. Here also, it is the tangled ambiguities of the fairy-tales which come as near as Andersen dared to revelation. </p> <p>It may be that Andersen's obsessive travels, his febrile restlessness as he moved from lodging to lodging in Copenhagen, are a surrogate for a symbolic and psychic compensation in respect of erotic unfulfilment. One feels dizzy at Wullschlager's picturesque chronicle. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal - voyage after voyage, under often strenuous conditions. Lionised in England, Andersen overstayed his welcome as Dickens's house-guest. </p> <p>Jackie Wullschlager's account of the meeting between these two virtuosi of childhood anguish and unfolding is a delight. Though in failing health, the pied piper continued to chase across Europe and Denmark in pursuit, perhaps, of that elusive ice-maiden who haunts one of his last and most poignant tales. Andersen's funeral, in August 1875, was a national occasion. </p> <p>One would value a more substantial look at the exceedingly complex mutual awareness of Andersen and of Kierkegaard. Wisely, it may be, this book avoids speculating at any depth on the stylistic and psychological means whereby the teller of tales transmutes an often bizarre, localised happening or hallucination into a universal d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu, into a homecoming for children and grown-ups everywhere.

  "<p><strong> Robert MacFarlane</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Robert MacFarlane is writing a book on Mountains and the Imagination, and teaches at Cambridge. </p> <p>Ideally, the Booker Prize would be run like a criminal trial. Past offences (or past novels) would not be taken into account, and justice would be administered only according to the available evidence (the books in question). The Blind Assassin - Margaret Atwood's tenth novel -would therefore stand on an equal footing with The Hiding Place, Trezza Azzopardi's much better first novel. If this were the case, Michael Collins would win, Azzopardi would come second and the two writers with real form - Atwood and Ishiguro - would get nothing at all. </p> <p>The problem with Atwood is her self-consciousness. James Joyce declared of Ulysses that he had 'put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that's the only way of insuring one's immortality'; Atwood seems to be keeping a similar eye out for posterity. Like so many of her novels, The Blind Assassin contains some fine writing, but also more patterns than Dressmaker's Weekly; you feel coerced into admiration rather than offering it up voluntarily. </p> <p>Kazuo Ishiguro's When We Were Orphans is a weak novel by a previously brilliant writer. It is upset by instabilities of tone, a few of which have been deliberately introduced by Ishiguro but most of which are just inadvertent tremors of the authorial hand. The hinge of its plot is a very creaky one, and Christopher Banks is a narrator you cannot believe in - his plummy reminiscences read like Mr Kipling looking back on some exceedingly good crimes he once solved. </p> <p>The Deposition of Father McGreevy, Brian O'Doherty's fable about blizzards and bestiality is perfectly amiable but is in no way outstanding. The subject matter of Matthew Kneale's English Passengers - Britain's wholly successful ethnic cleansing of the Aboriginal Tasmanians during the nineteenth century - makes it immediately important. Kneale is a relentlessly inventive writer; the story is told by 20 different characters. However, the novel is fatally wounded by its frequent lapses into cod-Victorian. </p> <p>Which leaves Azzopardi's The Hiding Place and Collins's The Keepers of Truth, the two best books on the list by some distance. Azzopardi has written a tremendous first novel which, though it loses control in the final section, demonstrates an intuitive talent for image-making, and a sensitivity to how the emotional contours of a family flex and are disrupted by events. The Keepers of Truth is a thunderous, magnificent, apocalyptic piece of prose; at once a requiem for America and an indictment of its recent past. The setting - a decommissioned industrial town - lowers in the background as Bill, the narrator, unspools his story of murder and social disintegration. This is the wisest of these books, suffering only from an occasional urge to underscore its own meaningfulness - it is also the most enjoyable. </p> <p>Atwood may well win, but if she does it will be a lifetime achievement award and unjust as such. Ten pounds of my money are in the hands of Mr William Hill, backing The Keepers of Truth. </p> <p> <strong> Winner: Michael Collins</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Robert Potts</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Robert Potts is politics editor of the Times Literary Supplement and the Guardian's poetry critic. </p> <p>The Booker Prize has been, for many years, a reflection of contemporary readings of the British Empire and the Commonwealth. This year's shortlist touches on British activity in Shanghai (Ishiguro); rural poverty in Ireland (O'Doherty); Maltese immigrants in Cardiff (Azzopardi); political intrigues located around twentieth-century Canada (Atwood); and Victorian exploitation in Tasmania (Kneale). An exception is Michael Collins, who, though Limerick-born, offers an unequivocally American novel. While Atwood (now shortlisted for the fourth time) certainly merits reward for her exemplary corpus, The Blind Assassin, though engrossing and brilliantly written, is not her finest work. </p> <p>Ishiguro, a previous and deserving winner, is disappointing in When We Were Orphans. His narrator's stilted diction begins to jar and, more damagingly, to bore; the plot creaks and clunks. In contrast, Michael Collins's The Keepers of Truth offers an intelligent but mentally ill narrator whose overblown style is absolutely in keeping with the mismatch between his education and aspirations. Brian O'Doherty's story of rural hardship and unorthodox animal husbandry in a winter-gripped mountain village deserves the wider readership that the Booker will give it. It produces an abiding sense of compassion and resilience, despite its many sadnesses. </p> <p>Either of the two remaining books would be a worthy winner. Trezza Azzopardi's The Hiding Place, so unsparing in its tensions and tragedies yet so rich in its energy, wit and detail, is emotionally haunting and captivating. Its slow finish, after a bustling, brilliant series of vignettes and voices, has an honesty which one would be loath to trade for anything gentler or neater. Matthew Kneale's marvellous English Passengers, telling an old imperial tale through many voices, manages to revive some unpleasant historical episodes and ideologies with a remarkable, but not unbalancing, gusto and humour. These two fine novels are impossible to judge between, but by the tiniest whisker, I'd vote for Kneale. </p> <p> <strong> Winner: Matthew Kneale</strong></p> <p><strong> Joanna Griffiths</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Joanna Griffiths is writing a book about Knut Hamsun and Sigrid Undset. She has worked for the NYRB and the Guardian, and reviews for The Observer and the LRB. </p> <p>Family seems at the root of most of the list this year - origins, the failures of parents, feuds, abandonment. Our narrators are incorrigible genealogical detectives, self-explorers extraordinaire, drawing us through an attic trawl of diaries, photograph albums and notebooks. Decisive action occurs mainly in the memory; present action is confined to clue-hunting. Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin, Trezza Azzopardi's The Hiding Place, and Kazuo Ishiguro's When We Were Orphans are all identity-quests, set in a past-gazing present. The narrator of The Blind Assassin is an 82-year-old woman, musing on the collapse of her family's industrialist empire during the 1930s, her father's death, her sister's suicide. </p> <p>The disaster-afflicted family of The Hiding Place are Maltese immigrants, recently arrived in 1960s Cardiff. Dolores is unable to suppress needling memories of the rotting streets of her childhood, the low-league treachery of the Cardiff underworld, her abandonment by her parents. </p> <p>Ishiguro converts the family retrospective into a detective snoop. The hysterical narrator of When We Were Orphans, Christopher Banks, begins the book as a celebrated sleuth in a stylised 1930s England of 'chaps' and 'old boys'. But Banks's case-solving zeal masks the gap: the unexplained disappearance of his parents during his expat childhood among the opium traders of Shanghai. </p> <p>These are resolutely inward-seeking novels. But, the self-analysis is set against beguilingly exotic backdrops: inter-war China, 1930s Canada, 1960s Maltese Cardiff. Inner-searching becomes travelogue, by virtue of the strangeness of its surroundings. Our guides are its traumatised inhabitants - a startling array of misfits and outsiders: the ignored ancient of The Blind Assassin; Ishiguro's ostracised detective; Azzopardi's mutilated child. </p> <p>Matthew Kneale's English Passengers and Brian O'Doherty's The Deposition of Father McGreevy are veritable tours de misfit; the misfit as symbolic centre and nemesis of those orthodox and restraining characters surrounding him. O'Doherty's Irish priest-narrator is tormented by a libidinous village idiot, but too much a rustic archetype to carry the weight of significance attached to him. Simultaneously boisterous travelogue, mournful autobiography of an oppressed outsider, Victorian farce and post-colonial apology, Kneale's English Passengers supplies a fascinating display of the twitches of our times. </p> <p>The list includes a whirling dervish satire on parent-questing confessionals and outsider-worship - Michael Collins's The Keepers of Truth. In a US hicksville, local hack Bill becomes perversely enticed by a local case of patricide. For raucous hilarity, and for offering a timely antidote to the trend for self-analysis as epic quest, Collins's The Keepers of Truth clearly goes before the others. Atwood's The Blind Assassin I'd put as runner-up, for a grand scheme performed with desultory lacklustre. If the judges prefer their novels more dark and languid, then Azzopardi's The Hiding Place might claim it. </p> <p> <strong> Winner: Michael Collins</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Justine Ettler</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Justine Ettler is the best-selling author of The River Ophelia and is working on her fourth novel. </p> <p> Viewed as a whole, this year's shortlist is, for the most part, a delectable combination of well-known writers and new talent. A common thread is a haunting preoccupation with tragedies past, with the exception of Michael Collins's The Keepers of the Truth. Matthew Kneale's English Passengers recreates the 'ethnic cleansing' of the Aboriginal inhabitants in Tasmania. What makes this novel so satisfying is that, in spite of Kneale's use of multiple narrators, the most sympathetically presented versions of events are narrated by the novel's two underdogs, the half-caste Aboriginal Peevay, and the Manxian Captain Kewley. </p> <p>Similarly, debut novelist Trezza Azzopardi's The Hiding Place is written from multiple points of view, but privileges the viewpoint of an abused child. </p> <p>Following this vein, Kazuo Ishiguro's When We Were Orphans is set in 1930s Shanghai and London, and zeroes in on the devastating effects of war, espionage and betrayal on a family. And while Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin examines broader social themes - the novel is a kind of obituary to industrial capitalism, Canadian style - the story is closely focused on the familial dimensions of industrialism's demise. O'Doherty's bizarre novel, The Deposition of Father McGreevy, seems out of place on the list. A kind of fable about a small Irish community torn apart by an interfering priest and its inhabitants' penchant for bestiality, it nevertheless conforms to the trend in other respects: it too is a historical fiction of sorts. </p> <p>Michael Collins's The Keepers of the Truth is the only book which attempts to come to terms with today's tragedies. Collins bucks the trend for retrospection, opting for something far more alluring and disturbing - an idiosyncratic and oddly chilling rant about the world today. The Keepers of the Truth is a cry in the dark protesting the wreckage left in the wake of recent politico-economic tidal waves such as globalisation. In shades of the blackest comedy, Collins explores what happens to the fabric of community in a small industrial town once all the factories close down. The results are thought provoking and wildly entertaining. </p> <p> <strong> Winner: Michael Collins</strong> </p> <p><strong> Odds on</strong> William Hill, Ladbrokes</p> <p>Margaret Atwood 9-4, 11-8<br>Kazuo Ishiguro 11-4, 4-1<br>Trezza Azzopardi 7-2, 4-1<br>Michael Collins 9-2, 5-1<br>Matthew Kneale 9-2, 6-1<br>Brian O'Doherty 6-1, 6-1</p>",
  "<p>According to Darren Aronofsky, his new film Requiem For A Dream isn't a heroin movie. And in some ways, he is right. It covers addiction in general, from prescription drugs to TV and self-improvement. He has also got a point in that the film has moments that are so extraordinary it shouldn't be pigeon-holed. </p> <p>With his debut Pi, Aronofsky showed he had an armoury of techniques that created a visual code for the process of a mind losing control. And in the final half hour of Requiem For A Dream, he uses everything he knows with devastating results. You won't feel worse - physically or emotionally - coming out of a cinema anytime soon. If the ultra-quick edits of pop videos have had a mainly negative impact on cinema thus far, this is where they come good. </p> <p>But in other ways, Requiem For A Dream is a classic heroin movie. It uses the swing from the floating gentleness of the high to the desperate, agonised search for a fix. It plays with our horror of needles. And it takes an unreasonably beautiful leading couple (Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly) and destroys them before our eyes. These are the elements that have made heroin more appealing as a subject to filmmakers than any other drug. </p> <p>Ann Widdecombe may think otherwise, but as far as modern movies go marijuana is a gentle giggle. Ecstasy films remain in their infancy and LSD had its day in the Sixties (if you discount unacknowledged acid movies like The Cell). There have been cocaine movies, of course, but the ones about users (Bright Lights Big City, The Boost) are far outnumbered by the ones about the business. Perhaps this is because producers are worried that coke addiction seems too much like the vice of the spoilt wealthy, and so it is hard to feel sympathetic for the characters. Or maybe it is just because, in the film business, coke is just too close to home. </p> <p>But the heroin film has been thriving, despite the fact that apart from a couple of brief and localised outbreaks - grunge, the Britpop hangover - it is a drug that hasn't really been on the cultural agenda in recent years. It is widely considered a regrettable fact of life rather than the source of moral panic it was in the 'Just Say No' Eighties. </p> <p>This year we've already had one excellent smack movie, Jesus' Son (the title comes from the Velvet Underground's 'Heroin'). Then there was the belated straight-to-video release of Permanent Midnight, an adaptation of TV scriptwriter Jerry Stahl's autobiographical account of how he blew a fortune on smack, with Ben Stiller playing Stahl. There was a heroin sub-plot in two movies about paramedics: Bringing Out The Dead and Broken Vessels. A couple of years back there was the critically adored High Art, and in the years immediately before that Gridlock'd, Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction. If movies did corrupt us, there would have been a heroin epidemic in the past five years. </p> <p>Hollywood's original beautiful junkie was Frank Sinatra in The Man With The Golden Arm. Like most of the better heroin films, it was based on a book, and in theory the internalised nature of drug-taking will always work better on the page than on film. Compared with Nelson Algren's novel, the film is a tame affair. But by the standards of Hollywood in 1955, Otto Preminger's film was genuinely shocking. The US ratings board - the MPAA - refused it a certificate because the Hays Code forbade depictions of drug use on screen. The film was released without an MPAA certificate (as, intriguingly, was Requiem For A Dream). </p> <p>We never actually see the needle enter Sinatra's arm, but we do see his arm prepared with a tie as a tourniquet, and watch his face as the rush hits. There's also a long, harsh cold turkey scene. And despite the assumption of the MPAA that this would all be beyond the imagination of decent Americans, the film uses junkie slang with no explanation, which suggests Preminger presumed audiences were be familiar with the meaning of terms such as 'monkey on the back', 'fix' and 'kicking'. Beyond the drugs, it has everything you'd expect from a mid-Fifties classic: a great Sinatra performance, a great Saul Bass title sequence and a great Elmer Bernstein score. </p> <p>As Frankie Machine, Sinatra cuts a rather more elegant figure than the broken-nosed antihero of Algren's book. The idea of beauty going to waste is central to the movie portrayal of the addict: from Sinatra to Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch and Heather Graham raiding pharmacies in Drugstore Cowboy, Ewan McGregor and Jonnie Lee Miller putting their looks at risk in Trainspotting, Tupac and Thandie Newton (along with the less perfect Tim Roth) as gorgeous users trying to go straight in Gridlock'd, and Billy Crudup as the sweetminded loser in Jesus' Son. But the most telling example is Jennifer Jason Leigh in Rush, a 1992 film about undercover cops who shoot up to prove their credentials, and end up addicted. Normally, Leigh doesn't play 'pretty'. But in the early scenes of Rush, she is filmed as a cheerleader-type, wholesome and good-looking blonde. Why? For the contrast later on when she turns into a scab covered, emaciated junkie. </p> <p>After The Man With Golden Arm, the next landmark in heroin cinema was Panic In Needle Park (1971). The combination of the new liberalism in censorship, and the heroin boom, made for a film that was a lot less circumspect than The Man With The Golden Arm, based in a community of users, rather than showing addiction as solitary vice. It is a bit dated and melodramatic, but it made the reputation of Al Pacino, and a young Raul Julia and Paul Sorvino also feature in an impressive cast. In the early Seventies, smack was the drug ravaging the streets in blaxploitation movies, Bond films and thrillers. One of these, French Connection II, has the definitive cold turkey scene, with Gene Hackman going through near unendurable agony. But then it would be odd if heroin was not rife in Seventies cinema: it was everywhere on US streets. </p> <p>The Eighties smack crisis, on the other hand, didn't produce a cinematic response. Cinema's junkies of the time were based on real people: Sid and Nancy, Charlie Parker in Clint Eastwood's Bird and the wrecked visage of the ultimate real-life beautiful smackhead, Chet Baker, lovingly preserved in Bruce Weber's documentary Let's Get Lost. On this side of the Atlantic, the most famous fictional heroin user of the Eighties remained Zammo in Grange Hill. The cinematic vocabulary of the contemporary heroin film was laid down in Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy (1989), although the film is set in the late Sixties. The gang in it are equal opportunity abusers - they'll consume whatever they can steal. The heroin angle isn't ignored, though - not when the film includes a cameo from William Burroughs. It is the things Van Sant does stylistically - the wooziness, the changing speeds, the willingness to render visions literally on screen - that are the template for subsequent heroin films. </p> <p>And it looks great: in contrast with the griminess of Panic In Needle Park or Sid And Nancy, most recent heroin films have been seductively lovely in appearance, at least until the infected arms appear. The seduction is necessary to explain the addiction, which is the central theme of most of these films. They are about characters being rendered powerless by a desire, being taken over by a force outside their control. This sets up a series of much-visited plot points. The ritual of trying to get clean, which can be played for comedy (Trainspotting, Gridlock'd) or used to show the terrors of cold turkey. The disastrous descent back into addiction. And finally either redemption or tragedy: the films break down philosophically into the ones that believe life after addiction is possible and those that suggest there is no escape. </p> <p>But what gives the heroin an edge over other addictive drugs - including alcohol - from a filmmaker's point of view is the shock factor of needles: shooting up makes heroin use seem so more extreme than any other drug use. Not just the act of injecting and the shots of the syringe filling with blood, but the physical consequences of scabs, sores, infection and ultimately amputation of limbs. Conversely, High Art (1998), in which the drug is only snorted, makes it seem an utterly appealing lifestyle option - lazy evenings lounging in a stylishly post-Warholian milieu. </p> <p>Certainly, there is a degree of romanticisation in heroin films, even if the characters in them either end up badly or undergo horrifying experiences on the road to some kind of recovery. But then if taking heroin was not - at least initially - an extraordinary experience, no one would get sucked in. A film that can't show why its characters end up stealing from their mothers to feed the habit is one you'll end up ignoring. Are Hollywood's junkies too beautiful? Possibly, but when the film gets it right - as Requiem For A Dream does - that should make a complex anti-drugs message more powerful. And morality apart, heroin - as a subject matter - has given us some great movies, just as it has inspired some great records. It's a habit that filmmakers shouldn't try to kick just yet. </p> <p>\u0095 'Requiem For A Dream' screens at the London Film Festival tomorrow (020 7928 3232) before going on general release next January.</p>",
  "<p>The cri de coeur is as passionate as any Daily Telegraph diatribe against New Labour, Brussels bureaucrats or the dreaded, loathsome euro. 'The question that irritates me most is when people ask me, \"are you still committed to newspapers?\" ' exclaims Dan Colson, the Telegraph' group's managing director and representative, on British earth, of lofty Canadian media mogul Conrad Black. </p> <p>'We've just commissioned a new printing plant in Vancouver. We're just finishing new plants in Chicago and Montreal and we're about to re-equip both of ours in Britain. The total cost will be not far off a billion dollars. And people still ask, \"are we committed to newspapers?\" ' </p> <p>To reporters seasoned in the economic actualit\u00e9 of business-speak, the question seems entirely reasonable. It is now more than three months since Hollinger, Black's holding company, shook the media world by selling most of his Canadian empire for $3.5bn to cable TV operator CanWest. Yet, bar snapping up a few Chicago papers a fortnight ago, Black has sat on the cash and mightily shrunk his $1.6bn debt mountain instead. </p> <p>The CanWest move left the Telegraph as Black's biggest earner by far and, fresh from being offered a peerage, UK expansion was thought uppermost in the 56-year-old tycoon's mind. Yet in a week of bid mania in the British media there hasn't been a squeak from Black. </p> <p>First, Trinity Mirror snapped up rival Southnews for \u00a3285 million to grab the top spot in Britain's local newspaper market. Then Hollinger's North American rival Gannett and the Guardian Media Group, owner of The Observer, were cleared to bid for Regional Independent Media (RIM), publisher of the Yorkshire Post. And bids thumped on to the table for the Express and Daily Star - the latest \u00a3120m apiece from the Daily Mail and Indian billionaires, the Hinduja brothers. Yet at Lord Hollick's United News and Media, which is running the auction, there has not been the merest flicker of hard cash from comrade Black. </p> <p>Analysts doubt Hollinger has the stomach or appetite for a bid battle with Lord Rothermere's Daily Mail. Senior Express insiders also question Black's record in investing in newspaper titles. Yet they forget the small fortune he has poured into Canada's two-year-old National Post, the first major newspaper to be launched in North America since Gannett's USA Today in 1982. With weekday sales of 325,000 the Post is overtaking the Toronto Globe &amp; Mail and due to make its first profit this quarter, Colson says. </p> <p>'We are certainly interested in the Express,' Colson says. 'We've asked for information. Frankly, we're still waiting for the information and, so far, I'm not sure anyone has seen enough details to make a meaningful offer. We've also got a reputation for not paying over the odds. And that's why we've not got hold of any UK regional newspaper groups.' </p> <p>Hollinger's exasperation with the doubters is easily fathomable, too. When it put most of its 350 North American titles on the block earlier this year, it clearly said control of certain papers, notably the Telegraph, was not up for grabs. Yet it has since rebuffed several approaches for its die-hard Tory title. Among other flagship papers the Jerusalem Post is also off limits, Colson says, despite reports of an auction by Black's Wall Street advisers. </p> <p>'Our intention is to take the CanWest proceeds, pay down the debt and look for other newspaper opportunities in the US, Europe and UK,' Colson says. 'We're now concentrating on bigger titles with more potential for synergies with the internet.' </p> <p>The world wide web was the stuff of science fiction when Black bought his first Canadian newspaper at the age of 22. He was born to wealth, the son of a brewery magnate and the heiress to an insurance fortune, and over three decades the strident right-winger built a newspaper empire to rival Canada's traditional barons, the Thomson family. An eager military historian (Napoleon is his hero, leadership his fascination), Black lighted on the Telegraph in 1985, four years after the Thomsons sold the Times and Sunday Times to Murdoch. At the time the titles were floundering but Black had forged his success on brutal cost-cutting and by 1990 the Telegraph group was handsomely back in profit. </p> <p>In recent years the Sunday Telegraph has gone from third to second place among the quality broadsheets, with a circulation of 813,000 to the Sunday Times's 1.3m, by virtue of a seven-day subscription promotion. But only one-third of those sales are at full price (against The Observer's entire 448,000 circulation). It is a testament to the strength of the Daily Telegraph - which still sells more than 1m copies a day - that Hollinger's UK arm turned in increased profits of \u00a343m on turnover of \u00a3340m last year. </p> <p> In 1994, the Electronic Telegraph was the first UK paper to go live on the internet. And, along with the \u00a3100m or so Hollinger is spending on its printing plants at Docklands and Trafford Park, a total revamp of its web offering is a main priority. This month, the new telegraph.co.uk website will launch sport.telegraph, with travel.telegraph to follow as part of a \u00a310m investment by Hollinger Telegraph New Media (HTNM), the UK internet arm launched this year. </p> <p>Corporately, Hollinger is still looking for a global new media partner, which can bring it the dimensions AOL added to Time Warner. It has also come close to buying papers on the Continent, Colson says. And with the Telegraph titles taking just 4.3 per cent of UK national newspaper circulation, the main opposition to Hollinger buying the Express is likely to come from Labour and Lord Rothermere rather than the competition authorities. </p> <p>Far from giving up print, Black's dream remains to buy a US title to give him more clout than the Chicago Sun Times, Hollinger's biggest US paper to date. And, as befits a Telegraph proprietor driven by power, money and influence, to clinch that seat in the Lords which was blocked by Canadian prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien a year ago.</p>",
  "<p>An online baby 'channel' recently invited me to write a series of articles in return for a generous fee and a year's supply of 'products' - then changed its mind. The company had reconsidered their 'strategy'. 'It is simply,' said the email, 'the way the industry is going right now.' Common sense is finally penetrating the world of internet start-ups. </p> <p>The rethink on celebrity endorsements comes after a series of high-profile names failed to deliver enough sales to cover their fees. Dressmart.com, the Stockholm-based retailer, rushed to pay John Cleese a king's ransom to gurn their logo on to our desktops. The company foundered with debts of \u00a32 million after one year's trading. Clickmango.com, the online beauty company, hired Joanna Lumley.

There has traditionally been a plethora of charities wanting beautiful victims to promote their message. Yet, judging by the Mirror 's gory coverage of Lynda Bellingham's abuse by her husband, all readers get via such tragic stories is titillation not information. When Lynda Bellingham and Sheryl Gascoigne reveal they were punched and kicked, readers can ask 'How hard and how often?' and find out. But they are rarely told 'How do I support changes in European law to ensure this doesn't happen again?' </p> <p>These tales of woe help break the 'conspiracy of silence' surrounding domestic violence, for example, but hold no sway with the likes of Jack Straw, Paul Boateng, or those doing the abusing. </p> <p>Even Downing Street, that home from home for liberal EastEnders and stoned rock stars, has begun turning down offers of help from riskier role models. The boys in SW1 have realised that while glamour doesn't rub off, mud sticks. When Noel Gallagher told a magazine he only endorsed the PM because he was on drugs at the time (Noel not Tony), were we surprised? The Gallaghers of this world are used to being the centre of their universe and no message, promo deal or sense of party loyalty is more important than their own self-aggrandisement. At the next election don't expect New Labour's campaign to feature videos starring Michelle Collins or posters revealing Carol Vorderman's assets.

And such 'partnerships' always prove lucrative for the guru. During Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's split they famously argued over who would have the 'right' to carry on visiting Gurumayi Chidvilasananda, their yoga tutor, after a divorce. Although such gurus once spurned worldly goods, this dame's ashram is worth \u00a314m. Donna Karan once distributed 'healthy living' tapes by millionaire Deepak Chopra instead of programmes at a catwalk show, while John Travolta has reportedly paid hundreds of thousands of pounds to fund Scientology. </p> <p>Like mutual parasites, celebrity and 'saviour' feed of each other's fame until both are satiated. The 'name' believes they are being 'freed' from their past unhappiness while the guru gets not only top dollar for their time, but priceless publicity and entry to the homes of other desperate patrons as well. In the case of Feltz's personal trainer and new lover Dennis Duhaney, one can only hope that he hasn't bitten off more than he can chew.</p>",
  "It was a line as true and yet as gloomy about the human condition as anything written by August Strindberg, but it came from an English soccer manager who has had a dead rat posted through his Stockholm letterbox. 'Sport is supposed to transcend the bigotries,' said Stuart Baxter, an former Preston and Dundee United player who now manages Stockholm's AIK. 'The reality is that it will transcend bigotries, so long as you win.' <p>Baxter - a kind of mirror image of England's manager-to-be, Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson - was reflecting on nationalism, sport, success, failure and the Swedish identity in the sitting-room of his plush Stockholm pad. His adopted homeland is, some might argue, the most successful country in Europe: an internet economy with a social net, responsible for exporting such world-beaters as Ikea, Volvo, Abba, Saab, Ulrika Jonsson, OM, the would-be buyers of the London Stock Exchange, Ericsson the phone company and now, maybe, Eriksson, the saviour of the English national game. </p> <p>A hundred years ago, Sweden was a morose and backward agricultural society still recovering from the legacy of terrible famines which caused one million people - a quarter of the then population - to emigrate. Today, Sweden has done a Japan, undertaking an industrial revolution in two generations. Once 90 per cent of Swedes worked on the land; now 90 per cent hold white-collar jobs, exporting hi-tech skills and management to the world, even to the English Football Association. </p> <p>How come? Baxter, a clever, subtle man, knows the success story, but he is also aware that Sweden is not just a land of smorgasbord and midnight sauna. 'When I started with AIK, we had a bad run.' He upset the team's nasty fans, the Black Angels, as ugly as Chelsea's The Firm or West Ham's Inter City Firm. 'There would be phone calls in the middle of the night, and the players were threatened. You know, calls like \"We know where your kids go to school\".' </p> <p>A letter bomb was sent to AIK's head of security, a Hell's Angel was killed not far from the family home, and they felt under threat. Then AIK hit a winning streak and the pressure eased. </p> <p>Baxter is philosophical about the weird pressures of modern football: 'As a manager if you were in Afghanistan and top of the league, you would be in heaven; if you were in Hawaii and bottom of the league, that would be hell.' </p> <p>He is aware of the rich irony that the very pressure for success means that Football plc has dumped nationalism: his own team boasts an Australian defender, Luke Casserly, an English second goalie, his own son, Lee Baxter, and Serbian striker Nebojsha Novakovic, who took part in anti-Milosevic protests in Stockholm. </p> <p>England's appointment of a Swede to manage the national team is just one more departure from bigotry, he believes. And Eriksson, who has written a book on sports psychology, may yet deliver the prizes home-grown Englishmen such as Kevin Keegan have so often failed to win. </p> <p>So why is Sweden so successful? 'When I first came here, Sweden was the model society in Europe, with a tough work ethic, but people with less were treated with silk gloves. People here are self-confident, reliable, very knowledgeable.' </p> <p>Jens Holsoe is a foreign correspondent for Politiken , the Danish newspaper based in Copenhagen, just across the water from Sweden - though now the two historic enemies are joined by the Oresund bridge. Holsoe divines something of Sweden's success in its tough past: 'It was a poor, miserable country until the Thirties. From the 1840s to the First World War a million people emigrated. The people developed their own resilience and sense of humour. Sweden has been constructed by mining engineers and Calvinists. There is iron in their soul.' </p> <p>Holsoe notes that Swedish business started with bigger units than the Danes. 'They thought big from the start. Now they have Saab, Volvo and Ericsson. But their success is not just economic. They have been better at integrating their refugees and immigrants than Denmark.' </p> <p>Sweden today has a population of nine million, one million of whom are immigrants from countries as varied as Iraq, Indonesia, Afghanistan and Bosnia. Although racist incidents are the exception, skinheads in the White Aryan Resistance and slogans such as 'Keep Sweden Swedish' daubed on Stockholm walls are remind-ers that this integration has not been painless. A few years ago a sniper shot dead several dark-skinned foreigners with a laser-sighted gun. </p> <p>But economic success has helped forge a new hi-tech Sweden. Trade Minister Liaf Pagrotsky has been at the forefront of opening up the new industries to competition, a Swedish version of Thatcherisation. State controls were taken off telecommunications in the Eighties, giving firms such as Ericsson a head start in the great scramble to make mobile phones. Today Sweden's OM group is snapping after the London Stock Exchange. </p> <p>So how come Sweden is so successful? Anders Johnson, editor-in-chief of the Dagens Nyheter newspaper, says: 'We have 500 years of a low level of conflict, compared to the rest of Europe. One reason is geographic. We are on the perimeter, and no wars have been fought on our ground for centuries. That means there has been no fighting class of nobles. When we disagree, we do so in a civilised way. There is a tradition of consensus in politics and society. Rather early on, we were in favour of the open market and free competition. We had a first free trade association with England in the 1860s. Exports like iron and timber to England were followed naturally by our first industrial inventions, such as dynamite from Alfred Nobel and SKF ball bearings. We created big exporting companies, with low class conflict. </p> <p>'And [there was] a less hierarchical, flatter society. The Swede working abroad had the confidence to make decisions on the ground. No-one had to go all the way home and ask their boss.' </p> <p>Inventions and hi-tech were usual, even a century ago, he said. 'When the telecoms revolution came, we were ready, thanks to this open-mindedness to the world.' </p> <p>Open-mindedness is not the hallmark of every Swede. One of the modern Swedish success stories is Ikea, founded by Ingvar Kamprad in 1943. That date is significant: while the rest of Europe was in flames, Sweden and Ikea benefited from its studied neutrality. In the early years of the war, Nazi troops were allowed across Sweden to reach occupied Norway, and Swedish iron ore was sold to Hitler. Kamprad himself was an enthusiastic Nazi sympathiser, though he now calls this youthful folly. </p> <p>The Army Museum in Stockholm honours the gentile, Raoul Wallenberg, who saved up to 35,000 Jews in Hungary. But the Swedish economy put its weight behind Hitler at the worst possible time - a truth that is not trumpeted today. </p> <p>Historian Lena Ostlund explained Sweden's success thus: 'We were not invaded during World War Two. Other societies were broken, but we survived intact, so we were able to make business straight away.' </p> <p>Britons depressed at Sweden's success may take comfort in a trip to Stockholm's sole comedy club, called something like Nolle Bugger. </p> <p>No one heckles. </p> <p><b>What have the Swedes ever done for us?</b></p> <p>In 1876, after a short residence in Sweden, Mary Wollstonecraft said: 'Sweden appeared to me the country in the world most proper to form the botanists and natural historian; every object seemed to remind me of the creation of things.'Swedish naturalist Carulus Linnaeus gave the world its system for classifying plants and animals. After his death his specimens were bought by a British businessman and used to form the Linnaean Society. Britons have continued to acquire many things from Swedes, but what have we given in exchange? </p> <p><b> Books </b> Astrid Ericsson Lindgren gave us Pippi Longstocking. JK Rowling created Harry Potter, one of Sweden's bestsellers. </p> <p><b> Drama </b> We gave them William Shakespeare. They gave us August Strindberg (1849-1912), playwright and novelist, father of modern drama. </p> <p><b> Design </b> Ikea has taken this country by storm. In Sweden, there is no Conran shop yet, but Terence Conran has opened a restaurant in Stockholm. </p> <p><b> Fashion </b> The Swedes were responsible for blue eyeshadow and false eyelashes. Abba is mainly to blame. They also gave us boo.com, an online retailer of clubwear, now gone bust. In return, we have given them elements of our street style. </p> <p><b> Food/drink </b> Sweden is well known for its smorgasbord. They like our Kit-Kats. We love Absolut Vodka. They drink our whiskies. </p> <p><b> Sport </b> Stuart Baxter (pictured) manages Stockholm AIK, we get Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson for England. </p> <p><b> Film </b> Sweden gave us Miss Julie (1950) based on Strindberg's play, considered by some to be the finest film ever made. They loved Four Weddings and a Funeral and The Full Monty . </p> <p><b> Music </b> They gave us Abba and the Cardigans. We got our own back with Oasis and the Spice Girls.</p>",
  "When Rupert Murdoch decreed his Fox television network must turn over an hour of its primest time - between eight and nine in the evening - to unadulterated Bush and Gore, just 2.9 million Americans tuned in. An all-time low, a fiasco. There will probably be an actual turn-out to match on Tuesday. This undynamic duo (as Willie Whitelaw would say) are touring the country trying, pretty successfully, to stir up apathy. <p>But consider: one day, the face of the victor will be chiselled from Mount Rushmore. One day his picture will hang in national galleries and his shrine of a memorial library will draw visitors to Austin or Nashville. Presidents of the United States aren't only politicians who managed to get elected; they become monarchs, gods and legends. It is the great dislocation of the race. While the watching millions weren't switching to Fox, five times that number were watching Martin Sheen play at being President in NBC's West Wing . The drama and the romance of the job still command an audience. </p> <p>But what, precisely, is the job? Stanley O. Jones, a professor of politics at the University of Wisconsin, asked a few questions of the freshman class at Beloit College there. They couldn't (among other things) remember Reagan; they had no idea that Americans were ever held hostage in Iran; they had never seen black-and-white TV; they knew only one Pope - and only one President. For young voters - the most turned-off of the lot - the once and continuing Commander-in-Chief is a man called Clinton and the job is what he's made of it. </p> <p>Jones is making a crucial point in a new collection of essays called The Permanent Campaign and its Future . Once, presidents stood for election. Now they run for election, and Clinton is the great runner. He's been running all his adult life and that life begins to draw to a premature close when there is nowhere else for him to run. Thus the running defines the role. </p> <p>Are Gore and Bush similarly fleet of foot and silvery of tongue? No, they're both comparative plodders. How, then, will they survive in the Oval Office? With lumpen difficulty. </p> <p>The calibre of the contenders, in reality, does not shrink. Is Gore a duffer candidate than Dukakis? Is Bush more intellectually challenged than Gerald Ford? (In fact, if elected, he and Herbert Hoover will tie as the most highly educated presidents in the last eight decades.) What the presidency does do is alter in its demands, a chameleon of elective office. </p> <p>There's no Cold War any longer, so the military dimension is gone and, with it, the awed deference due to the supreme general. Soon, no would-be president will ever have had a realistic chance of putting on a combat uniform. Even now, a few months in fatigues reporting from Vietnam or flying jets for the Texas national guard seems to do duty as the red badge of courage. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the need to raise funds has spiralled beyond previous imagining. Bush has spent $187 million this year. That lowering mountain of need has to be thought of and climbed every month of every year. </p> <p>But perhaps the most profound difference of all is in the parties behind the present pair. They are smaller than they were, diminished bands of activists trading insults across the bowed heads of tens of millions of independents; but diminution also makes those who remain more committed, more ornery, less willing to compromise. </p> <p>The zealotry of the House of Representatives' Newt Gingrich helped fashion is no accident, nor its ruthless pursuit of Clinton's impeachment. When Bush promises kinder, gentler times inside the beltway, he doesn't say how he will change his own visceral warriors there like Tom Delay, the majority whip. </p> <p>We reach election day, of course, without any agreed national budget, stalled between the Hill and the Oval Office. Another symbolic failure: the 106th Congress of the United States has done little but squabble (and line its own pork barrels). These are not accidental impotencies. The balances on Capitol Hill are desperately close: five victories will give the Democrats the Senate, seven the House. Nobody knows how that will look on Wednesday morning - three donkeys ringing on the slot machine or three elephants, but just as likely another division of power. What can be guaranteed, though, is that the focus will immediately switch to 2002 and the next round in the struggle for control. </p> <p>More cash to be raised, more rubber chickens, more wheeler-dealing and long days on the stump. There is never (as Clinton discovered in 1994, when the Congress swung against him) time to govern; there is only the need to keep running. </p> <p>Gore acknowledges that explicitly in his 'fighting' rhetoric and implicitly in interminable photo opportunities, sprinting between speeches, dragging a puffing Joe Lieberman in his wake. Winning the presidency is not the end, but the beginning of new races. </p> <p>Back to the great dislocation. Bush and Gore are being judged - by public opinion and the press - not for what they are, but what they are not. They are not Clinton, with his silky skills, his easy tongue, his undoubted brilliance at running to extricate himself from the last fine mess. </p> <p>Gore oozes facts and policies, yet he can't sell them like Bill. George W. relies on jokes to get him through, but he doesn't tell them as well as Bill. Both of them know that, in office, they would soon have to go crawling after compromise on the Hill: Gore pleading with the warrior Republicans, Bush in all probability needing the Democrats to keep him grounded in independent America where the next batch of votes will come from. </p> <p>Does Tuesday matter? Hugely, in many ways. The President is top dog in foreign policy and rigging the Supreme Court. His choice, for Americans, defines who they are and where they find their own centre of gravity. He will, whoever he is, set an agenda on health, education, social security, that tips some of the balances. </p> <p>But that is also all of a piece with the Murdoch ratings debacle. These are men of the centre ground trying to disguise it, wriggling back and forth and pretending to be something else: the Vice-President who doesn't campaign as well as his master and the Governor whose day job is mostly ceremonial. They field their wives and families like Windsors facing one kind of election and trade trillion-dollar plans like central bankers proving their gravitas. Why should the missing millions be so fascinated by that when Martin Sheen in West Wing does the charade so much better? </p> <p>Predictions are a mug's game. Bush is strong, but weaker in the states that count. Gore is weak, but beginning to erode the preening self-regard, the essential flippancy of the Nader campaign. America can't make up its mind: and that, I think, is because America knows in its heart of hearts that this is just another choice along the way, the choice before the next one.</p> <p><b> THE GORE TEAM</b> </p> <p> Democrat party spending </p> <p> <b> $100m</b> </p> <p> <b> JOE LIEBERMAN </b></p> <p><b> Vice President</b> </p> <p>Considered the 'conscience' of Senate and Democrat party; Orthodox Jew, moral voice and seasoned moderate; good cop and bad cop all in one. </p> <p> <b> BILL DALEY </b> </p> <p><b> Chief of Staff</b> </p> <p>Tough nut from the 'other' Democrat dynasty in Chicago, brought in to rescue and direct campaign.

  "On 21 July of next year I'm going to do something deeply unfashionable: I'm going to get married. According to the Office of National Statistics, the number of people getting married between 1988 and 1998 declined by approximately 25 per cent, dipping below the 300,000 mark in 1993 for the first time in 50 years. In the same period, the number of divorces fell by less than 5 per cent. On current trends, divorces will start outnumbering marriages by the year 2025, though I hope Caroline and I won't be adding to that statistic. <p>There are two possible explanations for this: either women are turning men down more or men are proposing less. Now, it's true that Caroline refused me at least half a dozen times before finally succumbing, but I think men are probably popping the question less. Judging from the presence of Bridget Jones and her pale imitators on the bestseller lists, women certainly seem more anxious about remaining single than men. Indeed, the reluctance of men to get married - our so-called 'commitment-phobia' - is one of the main themes of contemporary popular culture, from EastEnders to Men Behaving Badly. </p> <p>Is it really fear of commitment that's holding us back or something more rational? According to Dr Jonathan Scales, a research fellow at the Institute of Social and Economic Research, men are financially better off if they remain single. 'Men's disposable income drops when they get married, while women's goes up,' he says. For a man, getting married is like entering a new tax bracket without any corresponding increase in income; it's like moving to Sweden. </p> <p>My accountant confirmed that there was no tax benefit in getting married, at least not since the Government abolished the married couple's allowance last April. 'Start saving is the best advice I can give to you,' he said dryly. The only advantage he could think of would be if I transferred some of my income-earning assets into Caroline's name in order to equalise our incomes, thereby reducing our joint tax burden. However, he quickly pointed out that I don't have any income-earning assets and, even if I did, there'd be no guarantee that Caroline would return them to me if we got divorced. </p> <p>My only asset is my London flat and, following a landmark decision by the Law Lords recently, that won't be safe either if things go pear-shaped. It's a common misconception that wives have always been able to lay claim to half their husbands' assets when, in fact, that's been true of Scotland but not of England and Wales. However, the Law Lords have now decided that judges should regard a 50-50 split as a 'yardstick' when dividing a couple's assets. From a financial point of view, getting married is about as sensible as investing your life savings in a fly-by-night dotcom. </p> <p>So why am I doing it? Why would any man in possession of a good fortune - or a bedsit in Shepherd's Bush - be in want of a wife? The only compelling reason, it seems to me, is to make it harder to split up. To paraphrase Shakespeare, marriage binds you together with hoops of steel. In the less romantic language of economics, it creates a 'barrier to exit'. Should Caroline or I wish to leave each other, there'll be all sorts of hurdles in our path once we've taken our wedding vows. From my point of view, that's quite reassuring. Caroline's dumped me twice already and, even though there's no guarantee she won't do it again, she's less likely to after we're married. Since I'm in love with her, that's a powerful incentive. </p> <p>In general terms, creating a 'barrier to exit' is a better reason for women to get married than for men, particularly if they want to have children. Contrary to popular myth, there's no such thing as a 'common-law wife'. As Jerry Hall discovered to her cost earlier this year, an unmarried woman has a far weaker claim on her partner's assets than a married one, even if they have four children together. In this respect, the Law Lords' decision, while providing men with yet another incentive not to tie the knot, may end up strengthening the institution of marriage since it makes it more expensive for husbands to leave their wives. This is one of the reasons Scotland has a lower divorce rate than England and Wales. </p> <p>Tories want to make the commitment to marriage a cornerstone of their party's manifesto and the fact that married couples are more likely to stay together than unmarried ones is often cited by them as Exhibit A in the case for marriage. They point out that children born out of wedlock are more likely to be brought up in one-parent families and, as a result, will place a greater burden on the state. This isn't just in terms of social security. There's a well-established correlation between illegitimacy and criminal behaviour. </p> <p>However, it's possible to address this problem without necessarily strengthening the institution of marriage. For instance, the law could be changed to make it more expensive for unmarried men to leave their partners, particularly if they have children. Scottish law is about to be reformed to strengthen the rights of female cohabitees and next year the Law Commission plans to publish a Consultation Paper which will effectively propose that the legal privileges and obligations of married couples in England and Wales should be extended to cohabitees. </p> <p>The net effect of these changes would be to impose the same 'barrier to exit' on cohabitees as married couples. Once a man had lived with a woman for long enough she'd become his wife, whether he liked it or not. The proposed changes in the law would, in effect, create the institution of the 'common-law wife'. From a legal point of view, marriage and cohabitation would be completely equivalent, just as they are from a tax point of view at the moment. </p> <p>Given the high illegitimate birth rate - 33.9 per cent of all births in England and Wales took place outside of wedlock in 1995 - these legal reforms seem like a sensible response to the inevitable. At the very least, they may result in fewer absentee fathers. However, they would also end up limiting people's choices. Living together is one step; getting married is another. If the law's changed, couples will either have to go the whole hog or go their separate ways. There'll be no intermediate stage. </p> <p>Is there any other reason to preserve the unique legal status of marriage? In spite of the economic disadvantages, I've decided to tie the knot. Why? Because it's a very public way for Caroline and I to express our commitment to each other. If we'd chosen not to get married, but to simply live together in perpetuity, there's no recognised way in which we could communicate that decision to our families and friends. We could have a party, I suppose, but it wouldn't be the same as taking solemn vows in front of our nearest and dearest. </p> <p>There's something about the formality of a wedding, its official nature, that makes the decision to stay together that much more binding. On 21 July of next year, when we promise to love and cherish one another, in sickness and in health, till death us do part, it's a promise we both intend to keep and the fact that we'll be making it in front of 150 witnesses will make it that much harder to break. </p> <p>This is the greatest 'barrier to exit'. If the law's changed to make marriage and cohabiting legally equivalent, it may make it more inconvenient for unmarried couples to separate, but it won't make it any more shameful. For a married couple to split up, by contrast, they have to break their vows. By anyone's reckoning - Christian and non-Christian alike - that's unethical. It's this moral component that makes marriage such a unique institution. It isn't just a partnership conjoined for two people's mutual benefit; it's a sacred union founded on a promise. </p> <p>Oh, and one other thing. Caroline's training to be a solicitor, while I'm a freelance journalist, so I fully expect my disposable income to increase after we've tied the knot. </p> <p>\u0095 Toby Young is the editor of the Spectator.co.uk.

  "Once upon a time, a vital, enthusiastic man came to power in England. It was spring and the people rejoiced: all over the country could be heard the music of trumpets, and the glad cries of his name. Casks of wine were opened in the streets, rich men threw gold coins out of their windows to the poor, and bonfires were lit in celebration. After the long years of the previous regime, whose last few were marked by political instability and fractiousness, he was hailed as 'a prince of great hope', and his people trusted that he would right the wrongs made by his old, out-of-touch predecessor. He arrived in London triumphant, at the head of a gaggle of grasping acolytes, all determined to have their piece of the pie. Sound familiar? But no, this was not May 1997 but March 1603 and the man was James I, the king who succeeded Elizabeth Tudor. <p>Elizabeth's last years had undermined the unity of the realm, as well as the monarchy's security. James Stuart, already the VI of Scotland, was welcomed as the man who could heal England's social, political and religious divisions. Although Elizabeth's deliberately vague religious stance was intended to allow her people to put their country before their beliefs - if conscience permitted a Catholic to take the Oath of Supremacy she would not seek to make windows into his soul - committed Catholics were still excluded from participation in English life. Recusants faced fines, imprisonment, torture and, ultimately, death. </p> <p>James I's mother, Mary Queen of Scots, was seen by many as a Catholic martyr. When he came to the throne his Catholic subjects hoped he would view their cause with favour. They looked for religious tolerance and its attendant social and financial implications: allowing Catholics not just to practise their faith openly but also to own land, vote and travel freely about the country. </p> <p>But less than three years after James came to power the conspiracy we know today as the Gunpowder Plot was hatched, at almost the same time as a bill was introduced in Parliament that would make every English Catholic an outlaw. Once-high hopes for change had been dashed. The desperation James's Catholic subjects felt about not being able to reconcile their faith to their patriotism was mixed with bitter disappointment, and set a small band of them on 'that furious and fiery course' that would result in all their deaths. </p> <p>In the small hours of the morning of 5 November 1605, Guy Fawkes, a Catholic mercenary from Yorkshire who had spent the last years of Elizabeth's reign fighting for the Spanish on the continent, was discovered in the vaulted cellars beneath the Houses of Parliament, close beside 36 barrels of gunpowder. James's advisors were not surprised to find Fawkes there. They had been informed of the plot to kill the king and every member of his government, and to crown a Catholic in his stead. Eventually, they were able to arrest and execute all 13 plotters, and later used the plot as justification for their increasingly harsh repression of Catholics. </p> <p>Fawkes and his associates were desperate men. They believed they had no option but to risk everything in the hope that they might change the way their country was ruled. They may have acted so recklessly because their hopes had been raised on James's accession a few years earlier; the subsequent disillusion was then all the greater. It is always easier to bear a situation when it seems hopeless, than when a glimpse of hope has been sighted and snatched away. </p> <p>We remember Guy Fawkes's name, because he was the conspirators' front man, charged with implementing the plan to blow up the Parliament buildings and everyone within them; in fact, it was Robert Catesby who masterminded the plans. Almost by default Fawkes has become the symbol of the Gunpowder Plot, held up as an example of how not to protest. This is as it should be: no one could condone blowing up kings and Ministers as a means of achieving political aims. But perhaps Fawkes's fate is still relevant, a reminder of what extreme ends people can reach when they feel disenfranchised by policy, or excluded from participation in the political process. </p> <p>Is it ever right to take the law into our own hands, if we think the law itself is not right? Lord Melchett and his band of Greenpeace activists clearly thought so, indeed have been vindicated in court; they are supported by much of the population, as were the fuel protesters in September, and the rioters in Seattle last year. In a democracy, minorities can and should fight to alter the way in which governments govern. </p> <p>If Guy Fawkes's methods were wrong, that does not detract from the fact that James I was also wrong (by today's standards) to refuse to allow his people to worship as their conscience dictated. Remember, remember the fifth of November - and perhaps the sight of a blazing Guy on a bonfire tonight will remind our leaders that being in power does not necessarily mean they are in the right.</p>",
  "We speak the same language, watch their films and have fought and died together. Most of us feel we know America well. But the time has come to be wary of our century-long ally. The world's hegemonic power has been becoming more isolationist and self-interested ever since the Cold War ended, but if George Bush becomes President it could become genuinely nasty. <p>As British Euroscepticism reaches more hysterical and irrational peaks, the real story of our times has gone largely unregarded. The superstate whose ambitions menace our sovereignty and frames our policy choices is not the European Union - it is the USA. </p> <p>The range of American influence is already intense and growing. It was American investment banks which wanted to put the London Stock Exchange up for sale to Frankfurt. Our enfeebled film industry depends on distribution through American-owned cinema chains. Our research scientists register their patents at the US Patent Office. Our drug companies seek the approval of the US Federal Drug Administration. Our academics make their intellectual mark by being published in American journals refereed by American professors around American benchmarks and objectives. </p> <p>Our politicians look to America for their policies - William Hague 'denationalising compassion' as he attacks the welfare state or Gordon Brown building a social policy around tax credits are both overtly borrowing from Republicans and Democrats alike. And the American companies buying up our leading firms bring with them the same expectation about how to lobby and how to union-bust as they do at home, generating copycat British political lobbying firms and copycat legal experts adept at bending employment law. </p> <p>This is an American capitalism much harsher and more profit-seeking than ever before. It is creating a society in which everything - even votes - is increasingly up for sale. We think America is the same friend it has always been, but it is changing for the worse. </p> <p>Those with doubts should take a look at the US's relations with the rest of the world. The international framework in which the British operate is firmly run from Washington, and President Clinton has chosen not to challenge a tide in which the assertion of 'America first' is becoming ever more aggressive - and which Bush is pledged to intensify. </p> <p>If you are worried about global warming and climate change, then beware Bush; he will have no truck with any international treaty limiting the emission of American carbon dioxide. Debt relief for the poorest countries? Forget it. The establishment of an international criminal court? Baying for the Moon. Even American support for the United Nations, IMF and World Bank - flawed as they are - should not be taken for granted. Bush, for all his homespun affability, is bad news. </p> <p>He personifies the new business-led American ideology. He portrays Washington and the Federal government as evil, business and the private sector as virtuous. He has no truck with those who worry about the decline of public debate, public spirit or the common interest. Bush's heroes are those of American conservative mythology; the god-fearing, gun-owning, male small farmer or small businessman who is rugged and self-reliant. His 'compassion' does not stretch to spending hard cash on alleviating poverty or promoting educational opportunity. That would be unAmerican. </p> <p>Bush and the coalition of the Business Roundtable, National Rifle Association (NRA) and Christian Right which supports him are indifferent to the gross inequalities that disfigure American life; the mushrooming of millions of 'gated' communities at the top and the harsh insecurity at the bottom. Nor do they worry about environmental despoilation of their country, the violence in their cities or the gross commercialisation that intrudes into every avenue of American endeavour. Rather, they would advance inequality with across-the-board tax cuts that favour the rich, entrench gun ownership, weaken what is left of universal medical and pension provision, and cut corporate interests free of what little regulation remains. It is sheer poison. </p> <p>The depths to which Bush and the Republicans have sunk is their mendacious approach to the impact of money on American politics. This will be the most expensive presidential election campaign ever. Total political advertising expenditure, including soft money, is estimated to be more than $1 billion. And the business givers - the investment banks which demand more financial deregulation, the NRA which wants no change to the gun-control laws, the drug companies opposed to prescription drugs, the oil companies which want to drill in the protected wilderness and so on - all want to buy private advantage at the expense of public interest. </p> <p>In this, the Democrats, however business-friendly they try to be, will always be outspent by the Republicans. The trick is to evade the formal laws on campaign finance by enlisting interest groups to advertise on your behalf, which as long as their adverts do not mention 'vote for' or 'elect', is deemed as soft money - and legal. In the last four weeks, the Republicans and their networks have outspent the Democrats two to one, literally trying to buy the election. </p> <p>It makes a mockery of democracy, as both Bill Bradley and John McCain - challenging for the nomination of the Democrat and Republican parties - argued in the primaries. But while Al Gore is pledged to attempt some reform of campaign finance, Bush is unapologetic. The state should not stand in the way of those who want to give money to politics. </p> <p>It is an indifference to the public domain and accompanying celebration of the private that is uniquely American - and which has deep roots in the experience of the early settlers and the expansion west. Extending citizenship rights beyond the narrow domain established by the eighteenth-century constitution and into the social and economic realm has always been fiercely contested by the American Right as 'unAmerican'. </p> <p>Yet the paradox is that Bush's challenge comes as a growing mass of ordinary Americans are ever more concerned about the harshness of their capitalism, the decline of their politics and the illiberality of much social policy. Religious attendance is falling as is support for capital punishment. There is no fall-away in the support for international engagement. Support for gun control mounts. There is no especial demand for more tax cuts; rather, there is a recognition, as in Britain, that necessary public goods have to be paid for. </p> <p>Without his stunning war chest or the 'integrity' issue after Lewinsky, Bush would be in trouble. But if he wins, or even narrowly loses on Tuesday, his campaign stands as a warning. Beware the powerful American Right - they menace us all.

  "TWO RETIRED Salvadorean generals who admitted that their men were involved in torture and other human rights abuses have been cleared of any responsibility in the abduction, rape and murder of four American churchwomen by members of El Salvador's National Guard in 1980. <p>The verdict by the Florida jury was greeted with gasps of shock from relatives of the dead women, who had listened to accounts of the violence that swept through El Salvador during the conflict. </p> <p>The nuns, Maura Clarke, Ita C. Ford and Dorothy Kazel, and a lay missionary, Jean Donovan, were abducted soon after leaving El Salvador International Airport in Comalapa for San Salvador in December 1980. Their relatives filed a $100 million suit under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1992. In 1984, five members of the National Guard were convicted in El Salvador and sentenced to 30 years in jail for the murders. Later, four of the men said they had acted on the orders of General Jos\u00e9 Guillermo Garc\u00eda, 67, a former Defence Minister, and Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, 62, who was director of the National Guard. </p> <p>The verdict hinged on the legal doctrine of command responsibility and whether the men knew or should have known that their troops had been involved in previous abuses and failed to take steps to rein them in. </p> <p>But Ken Hurwitz, a consultant to the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights, noted that when Vice-President George Bush went to El Salvador in 1983 to urge the military to take steps against the death squads that were operating under cover in the war, some changes were made. He plans to move for a new trial. </p> <p>The generals said that they thought the military was out of control when they took command after a coup in 1979, but that they tried to send the message that the killing of civilians was not permissible.</p>",
  "Kabul's Hotel Intercontinental is a ghostly place these days. Built by the British in 1970, it was once at the centre of Afghanistan's tourist industry. <p>Guests would take a dip in the pool, before proceeding to the ballroom or relaxing at the bar with a glass of Afghan wine. Last week, however, there were three guests. There were 120 staff on hand, in case more turned up. </p> <p>But the boutiques, the old Soviet travel agency, Intourist, the American Express counter, and the barber's shop were all dark and deserted. </p> <p>All this might change, however, if Afghanistan's uncompromising Islamic rulers have their way. In the face of continuing isolation from the outside world, the Taliban are now making an ingenious attempt to win international approval. They want to revive the country's once lucrative tourist industry. </p> <p>In a symbol of a gradual thaw in Kabul, the Taliban have eased restrictions on visas for Western tourists. With 95 per cent of the country now under their control, and four years after they swept into Kabul, the Taliban claim Afghanistan is once again a safe holiday destination. 'We extend a warm welcome to foreign tourists,' Abdul Rahman Hotaki, the Deputy Minister for Cultural Affairs, said yesterday. 'We would like them to visit our war-torn country.' </p> <p>Tourism used to be worth $25 million a year, Hotaki said. His government was now trying to 'improve facilities' to attract more guests. The 'top priority' was to prevent further damage to Afghanistan's unique heritage, which includes relics from Greek, Buddhist and Islamic dynasties. </p> <p>If sanctions were lifted, more restoration work could be done, he said. 'We are all members of the world family. Contact with foreign countries will bring changes in our policies and way of living.' </p> <p>Three months ago Mullah Muhammad Omah, the Taliban's reclusive leader, issued a decree saying Afghanistan's most famous archaeological attraction - two giant Buddha statues in the remote Bamiyan valley - should be preserved. There were, he pointed out, no Buddhists left in Afghanistan to worship them. But he added: 'The government considers the Bamiyan statues as an example of a potential major source of income for Afghanistan from international visitors.The Taliban states that Bamiyan shall not be destroyed but be protected.' </p> <p>The statement represented a U-turn by the iconoclastic Taliban movement, which two years ago tried to blow the Buddhas up. After seizing the valley, fighters dynamited the head of the small Buddha and fired rockets at the large Buddha's groin. The attack damaged frescoes which had survived since the third century and provoked international dismay. Last year a Taliban commander placed explosives behind the remaining head and returned recently to dump two burning tyres on the statue's chin. Sources suggest he has now been arrested. The Taliban dismiss reports that they have damaged the Buddhas as 'foreign propaganda'. </p> <p>Over the summer, a handful of tourists found their way into Afghanistan - the first recent visitors to do so after 20 years of war and Soviet occupation. In August, two British travellers visited Bamiyan. Other backpackers turned up this month in Herat, Afghanistan's ancient cultural centre, close to the Iranian border. </p> <p>The revival of the hippy trail, which saw thousands of students and Peace Corps volunteers descend on Kabul's Chicken Street en route to India, is clearly a far-off prospect. But with the war now confined to the extreme north-east, Afghanistan is accessible again for the first time in a generation. </p> <p>'The hippies who came in their hordes in the Seventies didn't just come for the hashish, they also came for the wonderful Afghan hospitality,' Brigitte Neubacher, of the Islamabad-based Society for the Preservation of Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage, said. 'Afghanistan is one of the most beautiful places in the world. The landscape is unspoilt, the sky is spectacular, and there is no pollution.' The country had been the victim of 'devastating propaganda', she complained. </p> <p>There are major obstacles for would-be tourists. Much of the country is still extensively mined. The relics of Soviet occupation from tanks to field guns haunt the mountainous landscape. It takes at least two weeks to get a visa, only obtainable from Pakistan, one of three countries that recognises the Taliban. </p> <p>Once in Kabul, tourists have to check in with the Foreign Ministry and collect a government translator. Foreign women are obliged to cover their heads. </p> <p>In Kabul itself, most of the tourist sites have been destroyed. The museum has been looted. The art gallery survives but shows only innocuous landscapes in accordance with the Taliban edict forbidding the human image. The zoo contains a blind lion, Shir, a few wolves and some unhappy owls. In Chicken Street, the only visitors to the carpet shops and jewellery boutiques are foreign aid workers. </p> <p>The drive to attract visitors is prompted by the regime's desire to revive a collapsed economy and by frustration at its failure to win international recognition. Faiz Ahmad Faiz, the Taliban's foreign affairs spokesman, said: 'We have brought stability and tranquillity to Afghanistan. We have the support of the people. We want only peaceful relations with other countries.'</p>",
  "<p>Convertible cars are designed for single people. In School for Scoundrels, Terry-Thomas steals the ding-dong minx from underneath Ian Carmichael's nose by cruising up in a soft top and offering her a lift. 'Sorry, only room for two,' he smoothes, before revving his free 'n' easy way off into the sunset. In Thelma and Louise , Louise's car is a whip-that-demi-wave cabriolet, its lack of roof showing a new-found freedom, an escape from domineering men, two women's ride into a new, wild, unattached life. In Get Carter , the blonde driving the soft-top Sunbeam indicates her sexually single status simply by being at the wheel of such a machine. Unfortunately, she dies in it, too - as, of course, do Thelma and Louise in their car. But that says more about celluloid attitudes towards wayward women than it does about the joy of driving with the breeze in your barnet. </p> <p>I've owned five cars in my time, and four of them have had a tent as a top. As soon as I owned my first (a 70s Peugeot 304), I knew I'd never again consider a solid ceiling job - despite the rust, the mould, the ridicule inherent in a cabriolet, despite the (often physical) pain of actually putting the roof up and down. Not even having my fingers locked frozen into a grip-shape over journeys that lasted little more than 15 minutes has changed my mind. Because a soft top says glamour, and that's that. Even if it does turn your hair into wire wool. </p> <p>Luckily for me (and you), over the last 10 years car manufacturers have cottoned on to the cabrio way of thinking. They've offered us climate-mockers more roofless beauties than ever before. So we've been treated to the Mazda MX5, the new MG, the Mercedes SLK, the BMW Z3, and now Ford's Street Ka. All sans roof, and all (except for the SLK) eminently affordable. The Street Ka is likely to retail for as little as \u00a311,000. </p> <p>The joys of convertible motoring? The sun, the wind, the view - not just of scenic A-road mountains, but also the unrestricted vista around tricky corners during the school run. You get a sense of speed that just can't be realised in a hard top. You get a sense of real driving, too, rare in these hermetically sealed days of air-con and CD changers and whispering engines. The disadvantages? It makes you go deaf. And blind, if your wire-wool hair keeps whipping into your eyes. It's also much more tiring than cruising along in a sealed tin can. That heightened sense of driving can make you scared: the road is close and concrete and whizzing past at an impossible gallop. And a soft top's look-at-me sex appeal can easily be mistaken for swinishness. Or smugness. Or just plain utter twattiness. </p> <p>Which brings me to the TT. I've driven a TT before, a hard top, and remember it as a solid, masculine drive, with room for two-and-a-half. I took it camping, and locked the keys inside, thus testing its security, which was frustratingly fine. The soft-top version is, naturally, less secure (just stick a knife in the roof and away you go), but just as macho, though the one that arrived outside my front door lacked the previous version's red overstitching on the black leather seats (ooh, sir). Actually, I think Audi's desire to make the TT a chap's car just makes it camper than Christmas: all those studded metal circles, the straighter- than-thou dashboard (no girly curves allowed), the firm but gentle feel of the knobs and buttons_ The soft-top TT is a hairdresser's car, a divorc\u00e9's car, an A-Gay car. Looks pretty good on a girl, though. </p> <p>And, shiver me Schumachers, it's fast. Not too frisky - still a solid drive - but when you get into sixth gear (yes, you did read that right), you find yourself cruising on a cushion of air at over 100mph. I took it for a spin on the M40. 'How fast do you think we're going?' I asked my companion. </p> <p>'About 75?' he hazarded. </p> <p>The dial said 60mph more. Ha! Still, this was a singles test, rather than a check-your-internal-speedometer test, so I asked the companion if the TT ride made him, well, more interested than usual. He said: 'Can I switch on the seat-heater?' A few minutes later, he said: 'Mmm, yeah, maybe.' </p> <p>Such a reaction is to be expected when you're used to each other. So I thought I'd ask a genuine singleton what the TT can do. My flatmate, a desirable yet currently available man, took on the challenge and revved it to work, top down. The reaction to him was varied, and illuminating. The drivers of two different white vans called him a wanker; he got eyed up by posh girls in Kensington; and then, when he arrived at work, he was allowed by the security man to park right outside the office in a space usually banned to his 3 series. </p> <p>During lunch, my flatmate took the opportunity of taking a young lady for a spin. Her response? Within five minutes, she'd asked him to marry her. She was insistent that it had to be in Gretna Green (a fairly long drive from Earl's Court). And she wanted him to take a tour around her mates' workplaces first, for a bit of showing off. </p> <p>Other singly factors? It takes ages to find the smoker's area, hidden, as it is, beneath a slidey plastic door. As all single people smoke, this seems unduly coy, but there are a couple of obvious drinks holders to make up for things. The boot's not a bad size, which is lucky, as you can barely slip a roadmap in the space behind the seats. </p> <p>The stereo system has a lovely sound, and you can hear your oh babee R&amp;B (quintessential singles music) even when the top's down. With the top up, the windows are a bit too small for my liking; they remind me of the ones in those old hippopotamus Saabs. </p> <p>But, such trifles aside, I'd recommend the TT convertible to any singleton with \u00a326K to spare. As long as they don't mind white-van abuse, or being mistaken for Stephen Gateley.</p> <p><strong> Audi TT</strong></p> <p> <strong> Price </strong> from \u00a326,300 </p> <p> <strong>Insurance group </strong> 18 </p> <p> <strong>MPG </strong> 34.4 </p> <p> <strong>Engine size </strong> 1781cc </p> <p> <strong>Max speed </strong> 138mph </p> <p> <strong>0-60mph</strong> 7.9 seconds </p> <p> <strong>Driven wheels </strong> 4</p>",
  "Hermann G\u00f6ring did it, Klaus Mann did it, the designated trainer of the German football team has done a lot of it, and Germans were told last week that their elected politicians are doing it too - snorting cocaine in the Reichstag toilets. An undercover television reporter visited 28 men's toilets in the parliament building, wiping surfaces with a paper handkerchief which he then stuffed into a small plastic tube. <p>When Professor Fritz S\u00f6rgel, a Nuremberg-based drugs analyst, examined the handkerchiefs, he discovered that 22 out of 28 bore traces of cocaine. </p> <p>'The Parliament of Addicts!' screamed the headline in the Berlin tabloid BZ, accompanied by a picture of Lord Foster's restored Reichstag building with its massive glass dome identified as a 'snow cap'. </p> <p>The Reichstag test results came less than a fortnight after Christoph Daum, who was due to take over as trainer of Germany's national football team next year, went into hiding following a positive testing for cocaine use. Daum had volunteered to have a sample of his hair analysed in an attempt to dispel rumours that his eyes' wide-open expression and short temper were caused by regular cocaine use. Instead of exonerating him, the test revealed that he had used massive quantities of the drug. </p> <p>German parliamentarians reacted to the news with astonishment and the Bundestag president, or Speaker, Wolfgang Thierse, declared that he was calling in the state prosecutor to investigate. </p> <p>The cocaine scandals have thrown Germany into one of its spasms of self-examination, leading some analysts to conclude that the pressure to succeed in a globalised economy is driving ever more Germans towards cocaine. </p> <p>'The constant, excessive demands made on our imagination, our emotions and our responsibility has increased demand for pharmacological aids to restore a balanced personality,' said social scientist G\u00fcnter Amendt. </p> <p>Addiction experts say that, whereas alcohol and marijuana are 'employer-unfriendly' drugs because they encourage people to avoid work, cocaine actually drives users to work harder. </p> <p>Germans drink and smoke more than most of their European neighbours, and official estimates suggest that more than half a million Germans have taken cocaine within the past year. Two thirds of these use the drug more than once a month and 75,000 people take cocaine almost every day. </p> <p>'It would be unnatural if parliamentarians were the only group to have nothing to do with drugs,' said Hubert H\u00fcppe, the parliamentary spokesman on drugs for the Christian Social Union. </p> <p>Since they moved to Berlin from the sedate comfort of Bonn, German parliamentarians with a fondness for cocaine have had a greater opportunity to snort than ever before. The German capital is awash with cocaine at present and users, especially in the upper echelons of society, are increasingly shameless in their use of it. </p> <p>At a recent party given by a fashion designer in a Berlin restaurant, staff were asked to switch off extractor fans in the bathrooms because the precious white powder was being blown away. Der Spiegel reported last week on a reading at a Berlin cabaret theatre where a writer sat in the front row, helping himself to cocaine from an envelope on his lap. When he formed lines of cocaine into a swastika at the bar and encouraged his friends to snort it, the only complaint came from a woman who objected to waiting to be served. </p> <p>Cocaine, which was invented by a German chemist in the nineteenth century, was the drug of choice in Berlin during the city's heyday in the 1920s. Everyone from writers and prostitutes to hotel porters and film extras fuelled their all-night revels with cocaine, which was available on the street outside the city's top department store, Ka De We. Although the Nazis shut down most of the city's drug-crazed nightlife, Hitler's Air Force chief, Hermann G\u00f6ring, is believed to have been introduced to cocaine by some of his fighter pilots. </p> <p>Consuming drugs is not punishable by law in Germany and users need not fear prosecution for possession unless the quantities involved are great enough to justify a suspicion of dealing. S\u00f6rgel admits that traces of cocaine may have been spread from one toilet to another on the mops of the Reichstag cleaning ladies, and that the drug problem among Germany's politicians could be less dramatic than his findings suggest. </p> <p> Denis Staunton writes for the Irish Times.</p>",
  "<p>'About a year ago, I was out with a girlfriend and some friends of hers. It was a fairly drunken affair, and there was a guy there who made it quite obvious that he fancied me. Anyway, we flirted and chatted and I found out that he liked the same music as me and read The Guardian - he wasn't an axe murderer, in other words - so when he suggested going on somewhere for another drink, I surprised myself by suggesting we go straight to his flat around the corner. When we got there, I started kissing him and initiated full-on sex, and it was good sex, urgent and passionate.' </p> <p>Afterwards, Kate, 31, surprised herself further. 'I found I just wanted to leave; I'd got what I wanted, but he got all cuddly and wanted to hold me, while I just wanted to get dressed and go. As I was leaving, he asked if he could see me again. I said, \"Yes\" and took his number, but I knew I'd never call him. On the way home, I was actually a bit taken aback by what I'd done, but also rather pleased with myself. For the first time ever, I'd picked someone up, done the whole role-reversal thing - and I enjoyed it. So if the mood takes me, I'll do it again.' </p> <p>That nice girls do is nothing new, but still some of us are rather slow to get our heads around the new woman who openly admits a pragmatic approach towards answering her sexual needs. When Kate told a close girlfriend about this episode, she was shocked to hear her experience disapprovingly likened to 'a lunch-time abortion'. A response, psychologist Penny Rennie-Peyton says, that echoes 'a mistake that has long been made that women only want \"approved-of\" sex, within a relationship or marriage'. It's precisely because attitudes like this still prevail that, even in the year 2000, it doesn't actually go without saying that somewhere between new wave virginity - \u00e0 la Britney Spears - and so-called stiletto feminism lies a genuine shift in real women's sexual behaviour. As increasing numbers of women delay, or even forgo, traditional concepts of commitment, they are articulating and answering their sexual needs in ways that are more usually associated with men. </p> <p>Emma, 29, is between partners at the moment, and quite prepared to approach men specifically with sex in mind. 'Never strangers, though; I always know them somehow, through a friend or whatever. I tend to just say, \"Do you want to come home with me\", and generally they do. I find myself less inhibited sexually in these casual encounters, because there's no pressure, and so some of the sex is great. It really is a myth that you have to be in love to have great sex, although love does make the morning after nicer. Sometimes I feel bad about it, though - one guy keeps ringing me but I don't want to see him, and I do feel a bit awful about that.' </p> <p>A lot of the impetus for women having sex on their own terms - whatever they may be - comes from the fact that, as Dr Terri Apter, a social psychologist at Cambridge University, puts it, 'Women have a wider area of feedback for identity satisfaction nowadays. They have a greater sense of being in control of their lives, both at home and in the workplace, so they don't feel that so much is invested in a man's approval, affection or bond.' She suggests, though, that we interpret this new mood with care. 'When women now say that no-strings sex makes them happy, there is no reason to disbelieve them. But I think the truth is that women do tire of this behaviour more quickly than men. So while it is true that women are now more able to separate physical and emotional needs - which is making them less exclusive and more mobile in their partnerships - that this separation is clear and unproblematic is usually not the case long term. We simply are not as good at separating our feelings as men are. Men are better at compartmentalising feelings, or perhaps they're better at denial.' </p> <p>Similarly, Dr Janet Reibstein, a psychologist at Exeter University, feels it would be an error to mistake these women for men. Yes, she says, more women are having relationships that are casual, 'ie they include sex but are not necessarily about marriage or staying together', and yes, they are playing the field and delaying commitment in a way that men have always done. But she believes that, essentially, women do feel differently about sex to men. 'I think women think, \"I can have friendship with sex because it's a different kind of love\", or \"It's all right to have sex without love, but I'm still looking for the right person\" - patterns of thinking that are really quite different from the way men think about sex and relationships.' Co-author of a study of women in affairs, she suggests there is a correlation. 'I discovered that there has been a rise in the number of women having affairs, which goes along with a general change in the way women view sex without love.' But crucially, she found that 'these women still felt responsible for others feelings; they thought about the consequences of their actions in a way the men we interviewed didn't.' </p> <p>Ultimately, she feels the fact that women are capable of having children will always be an issue. In other words, we are almost pre-programmed to eventually seek out a relationship with a man who will care for our child. 'And that makes women different. Although it's also true to say that our increasing ability to postpone the biological clock is certainly giving women a longer lead time.' </p> <p>But what about women for whom children aren't an issue? Who either never wanted them, or who have them already? Jane is 41 and has two children of eight and five. She lived with their father up until four years ago and, despite being basically single ever since, has a healthy and ongoing sex life. </p> <p>'I don't do relationships because of the children... I don't want anyone \"moving in on them\", so to speak. I also feel a certain amount of \"been there, done that\"... But I definitely want a sex life, I need one; I get uptight if I don't have sex, so I have sex casually. If the men I see do want more, they get told they can't have it, and they don't seem to mind, maybe because I choose them quite carefully. I tend to steer clear of intellectual men - too much baggage. The men I sleep with don't tend to have much to say, but that's fine. I certainly wouldn't want to take on the guy I'm seeing at the moment. I met him when he came to do odd jobs for me, and he really is just a bit of rough, just a shag, which is perfect... I call it shagging without ironing.' </p> <p>Terri Apter believes that it is single women like Jane, in their forties and fifties, who are particularly comfortable with the idea of sex for its own sake. 'I think these women are able to be stronger about their sexual needs. They're very comfortable with them.' And you can see her logic - older women are quicker to identify what it is they really want generally and to think that what they want really matters. 'This is very marked in women in their mid-forties on, and this applies to not having sex as much as having sex; they have sex on their own terms, and equally they are celibate on their own terms.' </p> <p>Ex-Cosmo editor Marcelle D'Argy Smith, now in her fifties, is far from celibate and says that she really came into her own as a single woman in her forties. 'Even though I never saw marriage as a pressure - I mean, how do people stagger on in some of them? - and I was lucky in that I knew I didn't want children, my thirties were awful. It wasn't until I got to 40 that I knew I was going to be OK. I love being single - let me tell you, I know where to locate great sex in this town. I have sex with friends; that is, we have friendships and we have great sex, but nothing more. The thing about being single is that I've never had bad sex... I've had long periods of no sex, but when I'm up for it, when I choose to, I have great sex. No one has ever shoved their elbow into my ribs in the middle of the night and said, \"Come on.\" D'Argy Smith's comments mark another change in attitude: we are fast approaching a point where there is almost less stigma attached to being a spinster than there is to being married. Or to being in a bad marriage, at least. As one expert put it: 'Women now feel the same as men - that they don't have to buy the cow, so to speak, they can just take the milk, which might mean sex and not committing.' </p> <p>Eleanor, 50, was in a bad marriage but separated from her husband two years ago. She has been single ever since and says she has never been happier. 'I'm a young 50... I drink too much, smoke too much and, when I feel like it, I fuck too much.' For her, freedom has meant resigning herself to the fact that she won't have children. 'I had a miscarriage during my marriage, which was devastating, but I believe it just wasn't meant to be. Nowadays, I try to do exactly what I want to do when I want to, and obviously it's a bloody bore if I'm financially restrained, but I don't feel restrained in any other way. There will always be sex in my life; I can't imagine not being sexually active, but I don't want a relationship.' It took her a long time to get over the last one. 'Obviously they're great when they're good, but when they're bad, they're draining, you're in turmoil and it's hideous.' She has had two sexual relationships since her marriage ended. Both with friends. Or 'sex buddies', as Penny Rennie-Peyton quaintly calls them. 'Neither is with a view to anything permanent, which is fine by me,' she says. 'One is younger and bisexual, so no commitment there. We were friends and then sex came in to it, and it's a lot of fun. The other one is a friend who's married, so we have sex as and when.' </p> <p>It seems appropriate to end on what men might be making of all this. Surely this balancing of the sexual scales is contributing to their much-discussed vulnerability and confusion? Maybe I talk to the wrong ones. Richard Parry, 33, was in a pub in Brixton one night when 'a woman came up to me at closing time and said, \"Get your coat, we're going.\" I asked if she was serious, and she was.' He didn't find it confusing at all. 'I was quite surprised by the whole thing, but pleasantly so. As we walked down the street together, she then assured me that she was going to take me home and fuck me, which she did.' </p> <p>Richard took her number the next morning but never rang. 'I got the distinct impression that she couldn't give a toss whether I called her or not!'</p> <p>\u0095 Some names have been changed.</p>",
  "Being single is more a state of mind than a state of matrimony. Every one of us has the potential to be single in our head while being in a relationship and, conversely, there are many singles craving a rela tionship and living every area of their life in a way that reflects that. The truly happy are those who do single successfully - or who understand what being a couple is all about. So which are you?

That doesn't mean you're not in a relationship right now, but if that relationship went wrong tomorrow, you'd survive. However, chances are you're not paired up. </p> <p>According to Dr Michael Broder, author of The Art of Living Single (\u00a35.99, Avon), one thing that successful singles have learned (normally from past bad relationships, or from analysing what went wrong with their parents') is that it's OK to be alone, but not OK to be unhappy. 'This doesn't mean you won't let yourself fall in love again,' says Broder. 'There are very few people in this life who are born to be single. But what it does mean is that you won't accept second best. You have a firm, clear idea of what a relationship should involve for you - and unless you find that, you'd rather be alone.' </p> <p>This need for relationships to deliver also determines how you function in other areas of your life. If you have a problem, you deal with it and move on, which makes you forthright and focused. </p> <p>In terms of friends, you have different people to supply support or help you with your many interests - because you do have many interests. Successful singles realise that life is for living, and that this is one time you have the freedom to do what you like. However, this is where you can fall down. You have to draw a line between self-fulfilled and selfish, and not become too insular. 'We need people around us for support,' says Broder. 'Don't start to overshadow the needs of others with your own agenda - see them as a balance. And re-evaluate your life and goals regularly. Your ability to focus and not settle for second best means you can get set in your ways. However, things change as we age or our circumstances alter. You need to reflect and adapt to this or you could find yourself living a lonely old age.' </p> <p> <b>Mostly B's</b></p> <p> You're relationship needy. If you're single, you're looking - if you're not, chances are you're in a relationship that's not really fulfilling you but you'll stick with it until something better turns up. 'Some people need a high level of intimacy and partnership in their lives and you're one of them,' says Dr Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, co-director of The Marriage Project at Rutgers University, New York. This shows primarily through other people's amazement at the size of your social circle - you seem to make friends with everyone. They probably also envy your relationship with your parents, which is likely to be close and consultative even in adulthood. </p> <p>'This need for consultation is key to needers,' says Whitehead. 'The more people can help you with problems the more you like it, as you find it hard to make decisions and move forward.' One reason for this is that you can be tempted to live your life for a day in the future. Despite your friends and seemingly active social life, you're often not fulfilled because you think everything you're doing would be better if you had partner on your arm. Also, you may not reach your full potential in your career or home life because you feel in a state of transition. 'I've interviewed many single females who won't buy a house because they want to wait to do things like that until they find their soulmate to buy with,' says Whitehead. 'If you are single, but dearly want to be in a relationship, it's not a human failing - it's natural. But it's dangerous if it stops you living the life you do have now.' </p> <p>It's also dangerous if the quest for a partner brings you into negative relationships - which it often can, as you tend to edit out the bad in prospective partners, and look only at the good elements. To change things, take a leaf out of the book of the successful single. Look at what you realistically want from life and make sure you're getting that. Once you are, only accept a partner who'll enrich it further - if you feel you still need them, that is! </p> <p> <b>Mostly C's</b></p> <p> You're a lone partner. You're likely to be in a relationship physically, but mentally it's a different story. In your head, you're independent, individual and free to make a break at any time. 'And while this sounds good to you, it means you're always keeping part of yourself away from your partner and stopping you both from being truly happy,' says Dr Frank Pittman, author of Grow Up! How Taking Responsibility Can Make You A Happy Adult (\u00a316, Golden). According to Pittman, most lone partners develop a distrust for the opposite sex due to problems in their parents' marriage - either through parents divorcing badly or living in conflict. </p> <p>'This teaches you that commitment is about losing control of some part of your life,' says Pittman. 'And as a result, lone partners make it their aim to retain control by asserting power. Little things, like not calling to say you're going to be late, and then making it up to them with flowers or something.' This bouquet defence also prevents conflict, which you avoid at all costs. The reason again is loss of control; rather than seeing compromise as a necessary part of relationships, you see it as win/lose situation, and to prevent you losing you avoid rows completely. </p> <p>Chances are you're reading this now and saying: 'It's my right as an individual to go out late.' True but, as Pittman points out, a successful relationship doesn't mean losing individuality - you should still do what you want - but it does mean fitting that around your partner, too. 'It's like looking through binoculars,' he explains. 'One eye sees your action, one sees your partner's reaction to that. The whole picture is looking at the happy compromise for both of you - that's when you really develop control, when the fear goes away. Otherwise you'll only benefit from your attitude if your partner dies or runs off and leaves you, as it won't hurt so much. But should you really wait till your partner dies to be happy? You need to look at where you learned your distrust and tackle it.' </p> <p><b>Mostly D's</b></p> <p> You're couple comfortable. You're probably in a relationship now, and that relationship is happy and stable. If you're single, chances are most of your other relationships have been firey and short-lived - or long term and stable - all of which is down to your maturity at handling what a relationship really means. </p> <p>'You understand that a good relationship is as much to do with the way you act within it, as it is finding your perfect partner,' says Frank Pittman. 'You've realised that successful partnerships are like a debate. There's no problem if there are silences, or shouting, so long as both people get to express their point of view, and that you compromise.' </p> <p>Again, parents who had a down-to-earth attitude to their relationship are often the key to finding this harmony with others, but often this affinity comes with history. Research shows that couples who fit together best are those who develop a history and remember it, who recall other bad times to get them through tough patches - and have good memories to sustain them as they do this (which is why those old photos mean so much to you). </p> <p>You realise that when you're in a relationship your partner is the most important person in your life. 'This is why people who do well in relationships tend to have few close friends,' says Pittman. 'They feel that the person they should be sharing things with is their partner.' Of course this doesn't mean you lose your individuality - couples where the partners never go out alone tend to be run on insecurity rather than true love (though romantic needers think otherwise). </p> <p>Being couple comfortable is a good mental state. If you're single, knowing who you are and what you want means you won't be afraid to live life. In a relationship, it means you can focus on making things work. The two combined make you a good person to be.</p> <p><b> Two become one: the celebrity singletons</b></p> <p><b> Caroline Aherne </b><br> 'I actually enjoy being single for a change, and I'm happy on my own.

One factor is increased life expectancy, so you'll have more men over 60 living alone. Then there is the increase in the break up of personal relationships. Not divorce - the divorce rate will actually go down over the next 10 years, but just a churning of partners. </p> <p>And then there is the fact that more women are choosing to live alone and having the earning capacity to do so. We take that for granted now, but it's a huge change that's occurred over the last 10 years. And if we look at those going in and out of relationships, the experience for men and women is very different. Going into a relationship is good news for men, bad news for women - as measured in terms of psychological health and incidence of illness. And coming out of a relationship is good news for women - they get happier, healthier and fitter, while men get sadder, more depressed and indeed, more prone to suicide than any category of the population. </p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> Most of my research work, when I started writing, was in depression, and the statistics haven't changed in the last century, and are not likely to change. The one group of women prone to depression are married women; the one group of men not prone to depression are married men! </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> But don't you think that's odd, in terms of what you read in magazines or books, the idea is always that all women are pushing for marriage and all men aren't, and just want to carry on shagging different women?</p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> Well, women had to get married when they were economically dependent on men.</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> But they still do it now.</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> That's cultural, though. Young girls are still taught to think about marriage and the fairy-tale dress, because they are being taught by their parents' generation, who were probably economically dependent in a way the current generation isn't. The next generation of young girls will have a different attitude. I was going round a primary school yesterday and I saw list entitled 'My Ideal World'. One 10-year-old girl had written: 'Enough money so that I can do what I want.' I suspect I wouldn't have seen that 20 years ago from a 10-year-old girl. And a survey by a young women's magazine showed that the number of girls saying they wanted to be nurses was now statistically insignificant. 'You must be joking,' they said, 'nurses don't earn enough money.' I think one of the reasons why married women are more likely to be depressed is because they take on a disproportionate share of the childcare. Actually, the group most at risk from depression, as far as I know, is women who have children under the age of five.</p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> Who have a confining relationship and no outside job...</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> And that's when the divorce rate really kicks in. American figures reveal that one in four women in their twenties are now saying that they will remain childless. We don't know if that will happen, but we do know that 21-year-old women are getting sterilised because they are worried about the impact on jobs.</p> <p>And so they should be worried: 90 per cent of 40-year-old American male senior executives have children, while 30 per cent of 40-year-old female senior executives have children, so women in America have learned the lesson that there is a trade-off between economic independence and having children. They are being forced to choose between a rock and a hard place, and that will remain the case until men change.</p> <p> <b> Scase </b> And you don't have to look to the States - you get the same patterns in the UK. And it is having the first child when depression kicks in the strongest.</p> <p><b>Maybe babies</b></p> <p> <b> Flett </b> Is that because women are choosing to have children later, and therefore have a lifestyle that is more likely to be disrupted?</p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> Very much so. When you are just working, you feel you are in control of a large part of your life. But once you become a mother, you have no control over life ever again. And for many of us, that's very difficult.</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> It also holds people in relationships in a way that doesn't happen when you have no children.</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> I'm 33, and if you want to go out with someone who is, say, 36 or 37, then there's a high chance they've already got kids, so it impacts on your relationship anyway.</p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> How do you feel about being a stepmother, Miranda? [Miranda is in a relationship with a man who has children]</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> Well, you just get on with it, don't you? The kids are nice, and so that's fine. There are just certain things that you don't do on certain days because the kids are coming home!</p> <p> <b> Flett </b> Kids are a big subject, but before we get caught up in that, I think it would be good to pick up on what the Richards were saying: is increased singleness primarily an economic trend driven by a rather fortunate section of society who can afford to choose whether or not to be in relationships, based on their earnings?</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> Undoubtedly so. The data I've been referring to relates to managerial and professional women who have access to the private housing market. On the other hand, there is a very large category of women - probably a larger one - who are increasingly dependent, moving in and out of relationships, left with the kids, probably also with elderly parents and doing part-time jobs with insufficient childcare. This is the 20 per cent of the population that is in the poverty trap.</p> <p> <b> Scase </b> Though, in some ways, a combination of higher salaries at the top end and a rise in the welfare state at the bottom end has given women a choice about whether or not to stay in a relationship with a man. And women are reaping the rewards of that by saying, 'Well, I'm going to earn enough money so that I can choose whether or not to be in a relationship', which probably makes for better relationships when you do enter into them.</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> Look at Linda Evangelista! She wouldn't move to Manchester!</p> <p><b>So, what is 'single'?</b></p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> I don't think we've even defined 'single' yet. I was going out with a girl for a few years and three months ago we split up. I'm not celibate, but I don't have an emotional commitment, I just see a few girls every couple of weeks. I think I'm single. Until a casual sexual relationship develops and I find myself being more keen to see someone and think: 'Let's go away for the weekend...' then I'm in trouble. Then I'm starting to fall in love. Then I'll stop being single.</p> <p> <b> Flett </b> That's interesting, that you describe the process of becoming 'not-single' as a casual sexual relationship developing ties.</p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> It's probably going to start as a casual relationship.</p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> I've got four dates this week and I'm so excited. But if I see one of them and it turns out to be really nice and I see him next week, and a third week for dinner again, then am I still single?</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> When you go out on these dates, do you necessarily expect to sleep with the person at the end of it?</p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> No.</p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> All the blokes would. You'd be thinking: 'Sex columnist. I can't wait until the meal's over!'</p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> Yes, but it can put some people off!</p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> As I get older, something atavistic within me makes me believe that sowing wild oats is all very well, but I feel more inclined to look for something more, because I do quite like the idea of having kids. I think it's a kind of a moral duty for most people.</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> God, I feel completely the opposite.</p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> It's different for men. A single woman can have children whatever the circumstances, whereas if a man wants children, he has to get into a wonderful relationship. It is out of his control.</p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> Perhaps more men are looking to get married because fewer women are.</p> <p><b>Lad culture</b></p> <p> <b> Scase </b> Up until maybe 10 years ago, men could dictate the rules of the game, because they had the earning capacity. Whereas women had the choice to get married or end up looking after elderly parents. Now, women can choose to live independently, and in the next 10 years, women are going to become the dominant half, they are going to be 'the daters' and dictate the rules.</p> <p> <b> Simpson </b> But isn't that part of the whole 'New Lad' thing, of which Piers is such an evangelist? Catering to this need for straight, single men today to have at least the illusion of independence? Heterosexual relationships are becoming more like gay relationships in the sense that it's between two equals, and children need not be part of the equation, so there's less responsibility. Traditional heterosexuality has been replaced by what I like to call 'metrosexuality' - people are becoming more narcissistic, more consumerist and more independent, whether they like it or not. And straight women, too, are becoming more like gay men, in the sense that they don't necessarily consider themselves 'incomplete' because they are single. But I don't want to sound too upbeat about it, because the gay condition does tend to be a lonely one. Though there may be a lot of friends and socialising, I think gays, like straight people today, have what used to be called a God-shaped hole in our lives - only now it's a love-shaped hole. We are a generation for whom family relationships don't seem to work in the way that they did in the past. </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> But, at the same time, relationships are incredibly idealised. Once God is out of the equation, the one thing that's left is romantic love.</p> <p><b>Wake up, and smell the cappucino</b></p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> When we think of 'singles', we think of people in their twenties and thirties, but now what you see happening, with an increase in life expectancy, is that people are getting to their early fifties, seeing that they have another 30 years to go, taking early retirement and getting a life. They're looking at someone across the breakfast table and saying to themselves, 'No, I don't think so...'</p> <p> <b> Simpson </b> And women are more discriminating now, aren't they? It's partly a process of education - or brain-washing, if you like, by advertising - but women have been told to desire a man with Brad Pitt pecs and a washboard stomach.</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> It's a long time since I've shagged anyone with a washboard stomach.</p> <p> <b> Simpson </b> But I do think that the advertising industry in the 80s did foist on to women what was effectively a gay way of looking at men. A lot of men really do believe that that is the way women look at them nowadays.</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> But if this greater economic power allows women to stop putting up with a bloke who is ugly just because he's got money, then hurrah for that! I think the media reflects - not always accurately - real changes that are happening within society. And though I speak as somebody who is in a relationship which is the most precious thing in my life, I also think we need to be militant about the advantages of being single. There's that line in Jerry McGuire , 'You complete me', which echoes a kind of nostalgic ideal that we are all two halves of a whole. And I think the quicker we debunk that myth, the better.</p> <p> <b> Litvinoff </b> Going back to the emotional impact on single men, I think one of the main differences is that a single woman is able to get an enormous amount of emotional support from her network of friends, while single men are very isolated emotionally.</p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> The thing I have discovered about being single is that on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, when I'm out and about, dating, coming home late and not having to tell anyone where I've been or worry about where they've been... that's all fine. But Sundays I struggle with.</p> <p> <b> Flett </b> You need a dog, Piers!</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> If you look at under-25s, their whole modus operandi is a bit like getting on and off a bus. But now older people are getting on and off the bus, too, having serial relationships, so no one is single for a very long time - or in a relationship for very long.</p> <p> <b> Flett </b> How do you define a 'long time'?</p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> About eight to 10 years.</p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> I've never been with anyone for eight to 10 years! </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> Me neither. </p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> The thing I find very sinister is the people who cannot come out of a relationship without having another one to go into. Being single is a totally necessary, regenerative thing, allowing you to recharge your emotional batteries. </p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> That is interesting. That is the major difference between you and older generations of men, because I knew only one man who left his wife before he had another woman lined up. And I'm talking about the 50s, 60s, 70s. </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> But if marriages break up, there tends to be someone else lined up, because it's a more serious break. I always think that women, even if they're really happy, are constantly assessing a relationship: 'Is this OK?', 'Are we doing this right?', 'I want to talk about this...' </p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> And when she walks out, then the man will assess what it has meant and why it went wrong, but not any earlier. </p> <p><b>Friends</b></p> <p> <b> Litvinoff </b> Apart from all the pain and grief of breaking up with somebody, a lot of your support systems fall away, because we tend to congregate with like-minded people. And so you go through a couple of years of re-finding and redefining a new network. </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> And by the time you've redefined that network, you're probably so damn proud of what you've achieved that you're going to hang on to your single status for as long as you can! </p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> About three days ago, a friend of mine invited me and some other male friends for a curry on his birthday. And I went along and I had one of the most miserable nights of my life. There were 10 of my mates there, and 10 of their bloody girlfriends. I was getting incensed by their smug togetherness and, being the only one on my own, I was resented by every one of the females. Like I'm Jack the Lad, likely to lead their blokes astray - go out for a drink with them and say, 'Come on, let's pull a woman.' </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> And all the blokes thought you were hitting on their girlfriends. But it's also a nightmare if you are going out with someone and all you do is see other couples. </p> <p> <b> Litvinoff </b> In Victorian times, a man was supposed to cut off his single male friends once he got married. </p> <p> <b> Hernu </b> It's still like that! </p> <p><b>Nature vs nurture</b></p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> Geri Halliwell said she doesn't want a relationship, because she wants to put all the effort into her work. I've noticed that when I've got a new boyfriend I phone up GQ and say, 'I'm really sorry, but my column's bound to be late!' </p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> When I was a teenager, I really envied boys for the way they could just concentrate on whatever they were interested in, whereas I was expected to help my mother and pay attention to what other people needed before I could do the things I was interested in. The joy of living on my own is that now I just do those things! </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> Do you think women are taught that? I think women walk into a room and always check the emotional temperature. </p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> There's a famous experiment in which a tape of a baby crying was played to a classroom of pre-adolescents who were videotaped while wearing heart and blood pressure monitors. When the baby cried, all the young girls showed visible signs of distress and all the boys just sat back. But the monitors told a different story: the boys' heart rate and blood pressure went up just as quickly as the girls'. </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> But they didn't do anything about it! </p> <p> <b>Fools rush in</b></p> <p> <b> Flett </b> Dorothy, are we seeing more sad people rattling around on Prozac as a result of an increase in singleness, or is it purely coincidence? </p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> Well, it's not what happens to us that determines our behaviour, but how we interpret what happens to us. </p> <p> <b> Litvinoff </b> It's also about looking outside yourself. If you say, 'I'm lonely because I'm single', it's misunderstanding the point. </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> That you're lonely because you're lonely? </p> <p> <b> Rowe </b> An awful lot of people make themselves extremely unhappy because they believe that we live in a just world, where goodness is ultimately rewarded and badness is punished. So when they are not getting the rewards they believe they're entitled to, they get very miserable. Earlier in our conversation, the question of envy came up - of single people envying couples and couples envying single people and, you know, envy is universal. </p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> It seems easier to see happiness in others than to see it in yourself. But I don't want to give up on the pursuit of happiness - I want to give up on the idealisation or the expectation of it. It's very important that the US constitution talks about 'the right to the pursuit of happiness' but it does not say 'the right to happiness'. One way to pursue happiness is through a relationship with somebody with whom you can share an inspirational and fulfilling life, the other route is by finding your own journey. </p> <p> <b> Sawyer </b> I find, among people I know, that they are really keen to see certain people's relationships as fantastic, but in fact, you never know what's happening in other people's relationships, do you? </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> Some of my friends were particularly upset by the end of my marriage because they had invested a part of themselves in its success. </p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> Yes, they wanted it to work out because that gives them hope that it might work out for them. </p> <p><b>Happy ever after</b></p> <p> <b> Flett </b> So what is the prognosis for an ageing, single society? </p> <p> <b> Scase </b> Anthony Storr's book Solitude , published about 10 years ago now, reflects that there has been a change in society's attitude towards individuals. Storr argues that people who weren't in couple relationships used to be seen to be psychologically immature, but then he gives examples - in science, the arts, all sorts of spheres in all periods of history - that the great writers, artists and scientists were all single people. And he goes on to argue that the reason why they were so creative was because they had emotional maturity. </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> Or maybe they just had a lot more time on their hands in which to paint the Sistine chapel ceiling... </p> <p> <b> Scase </b> I think, as we move into the 21st century, people are developing a far greater degree of emotional maturity, and the outcome of that is an increasing stratum of people who are choosing to live alone on the grounds that this is the safest, most secure way to be. And I think that a lot of the things we've been talking about in terms of gender roles and identities are to do with the UK. If you go to Scandinavia, for example, or some of the anthropological societies, you have very different relationships between men and women. The UK, as an industrial or information society, hasn't adapted to this single-person lifestyle. It's changing, but it hasn't kept up with the trends we've been talking about today. </p> <p> <b> Litvinoff </b> Having been a single parent myself, I do still think that it is better for children to be brought up in a family unit or, at the very least, in a stable extended sort of family. </p> <p> <b> Taylor </b> Expectations of marriage are going to keep going up. We're allowed to rent people now, so if you want to buy one you need to make sure it's a long-term relationship. </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> So again, it comes back to this consumerist notion of wanting something that's difficult to buy, like the latest Prada handbag. </p> <p> <b> Reeves </b> I think we'll know we've made progress when the very question we're addressing today has ceased to be relevant. I do think the real possibility offered by a society in which more people are capable of being single is not only that it becomes a legitimate lifestyle choice but that it enriches the relationships that are around. I can't imagine a world in which people, gay or straight, don't want to be, at least for part of their lives, in relationships with other people. </p> <p>There's a very good chapter in Susie Orbach's book, The Impossibility of Sex , about a lesbian couple who find it very difficult to remain sexually attracted to each other because they have become so intertwined that they cease to see 'the other'. Keeping a sense of otherness in relationships is crit- ical to the chance of those relationships surviving. The ideal partner, I think, is somebody who you know could be perfectly happy as a single person. </p> <p> <b> Flett </b> That's a fantastic place to end. Thank you all very much.</p>",
  "<b>The widow</b> <p><b>Margot Barnard, 80, a founder member of the Bonn Zionist Youth Movement, left Germany for Palestine in 1936. Five years later, she met a British soldier who she later married; they returned to england in 1945. He died in 1964 and she's been single ever since. She gives talks in schools and universities about the Holocaust.</b></p> <p> 'I remember thinking in my forties that things had turned out pretty good. I'd spent most of my marriage as an army wife and enjoyed helping him with stage work. He was an entertainer. We had two teenage sons, a lovely home and a car. \"I've got everything I've ever wanted,\" I thought. But two months later, Ted was dead. It was 1964, and he died following one of the first open heart operations in England. People couldn't cope with death in those days, and I was ignored completely. An added problem was that I was still a good-looking woman, so the neighbours saw me as a threat and didn't want to know. For several months, I sat quietly in my room but then I thought, \"You've got to fight back.\" I didn't want to become a sad and lonely person. </p> <p>The first thing I did was to go away with my eldest son, then 18, on a package tour to Italy. I came back replenished, sold our house in Bexleyheath and moved to a flat in London. Although at first I found decision-making daunting, I soon came to enjoy it. </p> <p>At first I couldn't find an entrance ticket into the London social scene because I had no profession and people had no label with which to describe me. I remember one well-known writer introducing me to her friends with the words, \"This is Margot Barnard... but she's very nice.\" </p> <p>I knew I had to make some money, so I took in a German student as a lodger. That was how I started to make contact with the German youth. I wanted to stretch out my hand to the next German generation. </p> <p>I never feel lonely because I love being able to do what I want to do. I've always loved my independence: I even ran away from home at age 14 because my parents disapproved of my Zionist activities. I have lots of young friends, I go out a lot and still give talks in English and German schools. </p> <p>Since being widowed, I've had only one boyfriend, but it finished when he asked me to marry him. I liked my independence too much.' </p> <p><b>The gay man</b></p> <p><b> Jeremy Haneman, 28, is a musician and arts editor working on the launch of Queercompany.com, an e-commerce facility designed for the gay community</b> </p> <p> 'I've never been in a long-term relationship. The longest I've ever been with a person is five months. I like being single - it suits my state of mind, which is generally to be free and happy. But I'm not discounting a relationship. If someone comes along, brilliant, but I'm really happy the way I am. </p> <p>People tend to think that gay men aren't good at forming relationships, but I'm not sure if that's because they're gay or simply because there's a lot more pressure on heterosexuals to settle down. I think people can sense if you're desperate for a relationship and they steer clear because they don't find it attractive. Also, lots of people have hidden agendas: they want to be in a relationship because it's good for their self-image or because everyone else has a partner or because they don't want to be alone. About 50 per cent of my friends are in relationships, but there aren't that many who I actually envy. I see a lot of deception going on. Of course it would be lovely to form an amazing relationship with someone I loved, but I won't do it as a compromise to social pressure. </p> <p>I like being able to do what I want to do. I go out a lot to clubs, bars and restaurants, and I like having the sexual freedom to see whoever I want. But I also like being alone.' </p> <p><b>The Thirtysomething</b></p> <p><b> Anna Rickard, 31, is a quality officer for air pollution. She's been single for three years</b> </p> <p> 'People have said I have too high expectations. In the past I've tried to compromise, thinking may be I'll grow to like them, but it's never worked. Now I think, \"What's the point?\" The older you get the more you want from a relationship. I'm looking for a man who's dynamic, open, sensitive - and it's difficult to meet someone with those criteria. Also, I've got used to being by myself and the idea of sharing my life feels quite alien. You get selfish because you haven't had to consider someone else's feeling for a long time. </p> <p>The relationships I've had have all ended for different reasons, though I've initiated quite a few of the break ups. I tend to get bored. A long-term relationship can become mundane at times, and you have to work at it. I like the freedom of being single, of being able to live the lifestyle I like, and I've had the odd fling in the past three years. I meet blokes if I go out to a bar, but none of them has worked out. </p> <p>My friends provide me with all the friendship and companionship I need. I have male and female friends, some single and others in relationships. We go out in a big gang and have a good time together drinking, cycling, diving. </p> <p>I'm very happy hanging out with my friends, going off on exciting holidays when I want to, but I wouldn't want the lifestyle of my friends who have settled down and had babies. I think I'd feel trapped. I can see how much you have to compromise and give up when you have a baby. I'm probably a bit selfish for that right now. That's not to say I wouldn't like the close company of a boyfriend, but it's not top of my agenda. On the other hand, if I'm in this situation in five years' time, I might be slightly worried. </p> <p>I don't like being the only single person in a room full of couples, especially if it's all lovey dovey or baby talk. I feel quite alien to that, and I guess it brings it home to me that... oh my God, will I be left on the shelf? But I don't worry for long. I like my life, and I don't want what they've got right now.' </p> <p><b>The Commitmentphobe</b></p> <p><b>Josh Howie, 24, is a music-video rep. He is the son of Lynne Franks and Paul Howie</b></p> <p> 'I have a low attention span, and while I've slept about a bit, I find it hard to maintain a relationship for long. After a couple of weeks I stop returning the phone calls, and the big phase out begins. I'm not good at confrontation. The trouble is, while I might find a girl my age attractive, once my sexual appetite has been satisfied I get bored. Often it seems that the better looking the girl, the less need they've had to develop their personality because they've been able to manipulate men by playing on their looks all their life. </p> <p>For me, relationships are all about learning something and being with someone who can bring out the best in you. Younger girls don't have that ability. I've been with older women too, and certainly they have more interesting stories to tell. They've been around the block; they know all the crappy ways you're thinking because they've been there. </p> <p>I go out a lot and I'm constantly ready. My antennae are always up and I'm all set to bring on the charm. I was a very late developer and for years had to put up with constant rejection. Then suddenly the acne disappeared, I was 6ft tall and everyone wanted to know me. Perhaps my slight misogynist tendency comes from years of rejection. </p> <p>I like to think I've given a woman the best night of her life - it's a kind of \"look at me, I'm a stud\" mentality. But also on some level I'm paranoid I'm a fake. I find it hard to respect someone I've slept with. I show them my best side and still feel fake and think, \"Oh, you didn't spot that. I can't quite believe you bought my bullshit.\" </p> <p>A lot probably stems from insecurity. If I talk about my fear of intimacy with a girl who I'm trying to chat up, sometimes that just feels like another tactic - \"the honest trip\" - whereas they're thinking, \"I'm going to change this guy.\" So you can't win.'</p> <p><b>The Divorc\u00e9e</b></p> <p><b>Patty Deppe-Greenall, 39, was married for 14 years until last year, when she divorced her husband. She is a consultant astrologer who writes two columns for internet sites and has two children, Daisy, 11, and William, eight.</b></p> <p> 'People look on me as the baddy because I divorced my husband, but it takes a lot of courage to leave a 14-year marriage. I started studying astrology a few years ago after not having worked for 10 years. It wasn't my aim to become independent and support myself, but that proved very useful. As the marriage failed, I started working with clients and teaching. I built up my confidence by consulting over the phone. </p> <p>At first I was afraid of being on my own, but the quality of my life has improved immensely. I don't have to fight all the time or constantly clean up. Now I'm able to pay for the mortgage and the bills myself. Sometimes I spend more than I make and I'm always thinking of ways to make money, but at least I have a good time. </p> <p>When I was with my husband, I didn't have any drive or energy. Everything I did seemed to be constantly defeated. But now I'm getting things done. I've even mended the heating, which broke down three years ago, and put in a new carpet: people say the atmosphere is great in the flat now. I go out a lot more, too - to films, restaurants and bars. Before, there was never the money to do anything because my husband felt we had none. That attitude is very infectious. </p> <p>At first when I found myself single again, I couldn't bring myself to date. The first time I had a date I made it for three weeks ahead and then cancelled the day before. Now I've gone on a few dates and it feels much more comfortable. </p> <p>My astrology has a lot to do with becoming free. Part of the problem of getting married at 23 is that you don't know if you're compatible. In our case, we weren't. Over the last few years I've been finding myself again, and now I'm happier than I've been for a long time.' </p> <p><b>The Twentysomething</b></p> <p><b> Lisa Sanders, 21, lives at home.

It ended because it all got too routine. We'd stay in or go to the cinema, all of which I found quite boring. When it was over I felt liberated. </p> <p>Now, about three or four nights a week, I go out drinking and clubbing with the girls. We get merry but never loud and drunk. There are about 10 of us, and we're out to have fun. I've been around these girls since primary school, so we know each other inside out. If one of us has a problem, we rally round and support each other. Recently we all went on holiday to Cyprus and then to Dublin for a friend's birthday. I like having a laugh and going shopping with my friends. We get our hair done and buy stuff. Most weeks I'll buy clothes and shoes. I've got loads of shoes, probably about 80 pairs. </p> <p>What I love about being single is that you can do what you want. If it happens, it happens. I enjoy male company, but only as friends. I've got a couple of close male friends who come out with us and who I treat just like the girls. Sometimes I meet other guys while we're out but I never go off with any of them. I wouldn't without getting to know someone first. If they're good company, I'll take their number and meet them another time. </p> <p>If a boy wants to have a relationship, I tell him, \"I don't want one, but if you can handle being friends, let's go out and have a laugh.\" They don't seem to find that too much of a rejection because I'm not saying, \"I don't like you\", I'm just saying, \"I don't want a relationship.\"' </p> <p><b>The single mother</b></p> <p><b> Jacqueline Keiza, 32, is a single parent with an 11-year-old son, Francis. She is currently studying psychology and counselling</b> </p> <p> 'When I met Francis's father at 17, I slowly gave up one thing after another because he didn't like them. When I left him at 21, I remember thinking, \"Where are my hobbies, what did I used to do?\" It was like having a blank page. By 25 I was listening to my rock music again, watching black-and-white movies and doing sculpture - all the things he's made me give up. </p> <p>I've been single for 10 years, and during that time I tried to spend as much time with Francis as possible. When he was four, I got a job as a night-care officer so I could still be with him during the day. I would never bring a man back to the house because I didn't want my son to grow up with the notion that women are easy. </p> <p>At 20 I was very traditional. I thought you had to be in love before you slept with someone. But when I was 23, I met an Irishman and had my first one-night stand. It was great and gave me a taste for that kind of thing, although I haven't had sex for five years. I think I frighten men because I'm so assertive and independent. My sense of self comes from having regained my independence since leaving the long-term relationship with Francis's father, which stifled me. </p> <p>I love my freedom. I love going to hear rock bands, though I usually go alone - my friends don't like loud music. I don't believe in the traditional type of relationship where people live together. I think people are just conditioned to want that. </p> <p>If I were to enter into a relationship, we'd have to live separately. I don't want to make someone else stay up late, listen to music and watch black-and-white movies. Equally, I don't want to be made to watch football. People need their own space, and if they don't get it, they end up looking and sounding like their partner. Living up to someone's expectations drowns you. </p> <p>I love being alone and am far too busy to get lonely. My aim is to be a little bit selfish. It's important to do something for yourself sometimes instead of constantly giving to another person.

Now I've reached a state of equilibrium. A lot of my friends who married young are getting divorced, and I see them suffering both financially and emotionally. And I'm very glad I'm not in their position. But I do sometimes miss the intimacy and companionship of a steady relationship. When I worked in advertising with a large salary, it was easier to maintain one. Now I have a more erratic lifestyle, with unsociable hours. At this time of my life, I need to be focused - on my work during the week and being a dad on the weekends. Also, women of my age expect stability and commitment from a man, which I find difficult to give. I'd find it hard to put my heart and soul into a relationship, unless I met a woman who was understanding, stunning and not high maintenance. I want to start a relationship from a base of security when I've achieved some of my business ambitions. Otherwise I'll be doing it on the run, which I used to do - that usually leads to fairly shallow flings. </p> <p>I may not have much of a social life because I'm working hard, but I enjoy the freedom. I'm more comfortable in myself, more in control of my life.

  "The rise of the single person is the greatest social phenomenon of our time. Britain already has the highest proportion of single-parent households in Europe (one in four). Bachelors under 30 are the fastest-growing social group. Everything, from the family to the high street, the tourist industry to the television, has been altered by the new demographic. <p>In this week's magazine, we celebrate the single life. For the first time, being single is a proactive lifestyle choice, like the car you drive, the food you eat, or the books you read. People are no longer willing to settle for settling down. The single stigma has faded away (the more there are, the less likely they are to be pitied). Friends are the new family. </p> <p>It wasn't always thus. Not so long ago, the single person's home was an L-shaped room ('L' for lonely, presumably). A weekend break in a hotel meant a narrow bed and a single supplement. Dinner was boil-in-the-bag while watching Blind Date. Somehow, being unmarried meant you were either a toxic bachelor or tragically broken-hearted. </p> <p>As the tide of single statistics and soundbites grows ever greater (the number of over-sixties getting divorced has increased by more than 10 per cent in a generation; marriage rates plummet as women's financial independence rises), there's a sense that being alone is neither second best nor a stopgap between relationships. Even the late-90s stereotypes already seem out of date. Single woman doesn't ring 1471 (\u00e0 la Bridget Jones) as soon as she gets in through the door. She isn't hung up on her first love (\u00e0 la Ally McBeal). And single man doesn't go through his little black book the minute he's been dumped (\u00e0 la High Fidelity). </p> <p>There's been a significant shift in attitude, a feeling that singletons may be alone, but they certainly aren't lonely. Again and again, the people in this issue use the word 'freedom' to describe their lives. They've got the financial control, the network of friends, and the confidence to be independent. </p> <p>So, welcome to Single Britain: the hopes and the fears, the bedrooms and the bank accounts, up close and personal. This week, even our horoscopes are destined for the single reader (guess who's about to fall in love with a dark, handsome stranger... ). As for couples, the attached among you are welcome, too. You never know, you just might learn something.</p>",
  "<p>An eerie complacency stalks the land, or at any rate the saloon bars. It is seen mainly in the sneer which nowadays invariably accompanies the phrase 'dotcom'. </p> <p>The collapse of the internet stocks bubble is viewed with vindictive satisfaction by those who had neither the inclination nor funds to gamble on technology stocks. The apparently inexorable decline of the Nasdaq index is taken as a sign that sanity is returning, that we can all go back to business as usual. </p> <p>Alas, no. Anyone who believes the internet phenomenon has peaked is not paying attention to what is actually going on. The dotcom frenzy was fun while it lasted, but it diverted attention from the underlying reality - which is that the penetration of the net into every area of life and economic activity continues apace. </p> <p>Since the phenomenon is most advanced in the US, and the data from there is better, let us examine what's happening across the Atlantic. Half of all US households now have internet access. In the first quarter of 2000 more than five million Americans joined the online world. That's about 55,000 new users - the population of a sizeable town - each day; or 2,289 new users every hour; or 38 every minute. </p> <p>And then there's email. Of the two-thirds of American citizens who now use the internet, over 80 per cent have email, and 76 per cent of email users check their electronic mailboxes at least once each day. This means that something like 42 per cent of all Americans use email every day. </p> <p>As far as the web is concerned, the number of indexable web pages has long passed the one billion mark. (Google, the pre-eminent search engine, now claims to index 1.25 billion pages). </p> <p>Every 24 hours, the content of the web increases by more than 3.2 million new pages and more than 715,000 images. That's 133,000 new pages an hour, or 2,200 per minute. Or, to put it another way, something like 2,700 pages have been added to the web since you started reading this article. </p> <p>Some of these statistics come from a remarkable survey of US internet use which has just been published by the Center for Communication Policy at the University of California in Los Angeles. The study is based on an extensive sample of net users and non-users who will be re- interviewed at regular intervals and so will enable researchers to track changes over time. </p> <p>It paints a fascinating picture of how Americans are using the internet, and appears to refute many of the more lurid media fantasies about the impact of the network on people and society. </p> <p>The UCLA researchers found no evidence, for example, that internet use undermines family life (au contraire, in fact) or that it produces more socially dysfunctional or depressive behaviour than other media. </p> <p>What they were able to confirm, however, is the growing suspicion that internet users watch significantly less television than unwired folks - which may help to explain the television industry's ambivalent attitudes towards the internet. </p> <p>A similar ambivalence has been observed in the attitude of turkeys towards Christmas. </p> <p>The metrics of internet penetration in Europe and elsewhere may be less spectacular than those gathered by the UCLA researchers but they nevertheless point in the same direction. Stock markets may still be baffled by the internet, but hundreds of millions of 'ordinary' people all over the world apparently are not. </p> <p>The fact that they continue to come online in such huge numbers suggests that the net provides facilities or possibilities that they value highly. Far from having peaked, the boom has only just begun. Stock markets please note. </p> <p><br> <a href=\"mailto:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

  "No two men since the explorers Lewis and Clark have set out to shrink America as have George Bush and Al Gore during the final, frantic week of their nail-biting election campaign. <p>Dispatched by Thomas Jefferson, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark set out on their odyssey of 1805 to prove that the uncharted deserts and mountains of the continent were navigable by man. </p> <p>Last week Bush and Gore demonstrated that it can be criss-crossed like a village green, with a furious offensive of stump-speeches, mass-mailing, media carpet-bombing, aircraft pilots, palm pilots and dot.communion with the voters of America. It's a tribute to Air Traffic Control that their campaign jets have not crashed into one another; in fact, the two motorcades carrying Bush and Gore's running mate Joe Lieberman did cross paths, by pure chance, in Missouri. </p> <p>And Bush himself came close to a nasty crash on Thursday, when it emerged that he had successfully hidden a drunken driving conviction, picked up after a session in a bar in Maine during 1976. </p> <p>Bush was still fighting what appeared to be a successful counter-attack yesterday, winning loud cheers for his condemnation of 'gotcha' politics and helped by the fact that the tip-off to Maine's WPXT TV station - which revealed the conviction - came from Tom Connolly, a former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in the state and delegate to the party's convention in August, who concedes he was out to inflict political damage. </p> <p>Rather than try to capitalise on the revelation, Gore himself - campaigning in his home state of Tennessee - was anxious yesterday to keep a safe distance, forcefully denying any involvement in the leak. </p> <p>Bush's conviction, however, took second place to the question of his honesty, as a Dallas Morning News reporter, Wayne Slater, came forward on Friday to say that in an interview two years ago, Bush denied he had ever been arrested after 1968 - when he got in trouble for a drunken college prank. But Slater - whose paper is among the few to enthusiastically endorse Bush - was shy to pursue the point yesterday, saying the Texas governor was shut up by his press aide. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the campaign cavalry charged on. Apart from dodging scandal and gathering air miles, the Bush camp sent 110 million letters and made 62 million phone calls in five days; Gore's only a few less. Every local radio show has been meticulously targeted: hip-hop stations for rants against police racial profiling (Gore); Country 'n' Western frequencies with dire warnings against gun control (Bush). </p> <p>'The man who can right himself by a vote will never resort to a musket,' wrote James Fenimore Cooper in the American Democrat of 1838. That's as may be, but the virulence of last week's advertise-ments knew no precedent as Tuesday's showdown neared. Each candidate has run dry of policies to attack, so the ads counter-attack the other's attack ads. </p> <p>The burgeoning campaign coffers, apparently bottomless even before last week - have somehow found room for more, as further millions pour into both from corporations, millionaires, trade unions and interest groups. </p> <p>Daily, the two men move further apart over the clues and contradictions as to what kind of President each would make. Methodical Gore; intuitive Bush. Gore the combative policy-cannibal; Bush with his peaceful, easy feelin' - 'What, Me Worry?' Bush has been flattering 'the American people' like his father and Ronald Reagan before him, appealing to their Samaritan instincts while arranging to reward their financial greed. Gore, apparently free of his spin-doctors' chains and master of his own speeches, has become a rat-a-tat soap-box orator, palpitating with zeal. In an increasingly gravelly and imploring voice, he harangues 'the American people', urging them to greater things. </p> <p>Bush's standard speech has boiled down to 'Gore trusts Washington; I trust the people' and 'Gore is a liar; I tell the truth'. Gore's is about fighting for the common man and woman against 'special interests' and 'billionaires'. </p> <p>Their policies are likewise at loggerheads. There is no compromise over who is 'waging class warfare' (of which one accused the other all last week). No middle ground over their collision-course tax policies, plans for social security, healthcare and education, pitched against one another like fighting cocks. </p> <p>The fight itself, however, could not be closer: all that is certain is that on Tuesday the United States of America will elect a new President. Unlike all past elections since opinion polls began in the 1940s, neither candidate is stealing even a nose on the final lap. The vote will go to the wire. Although most polls show Bush creaking ahead in percentage terms, they also give each candidate around 200 votes apiece in the electoral college, with some 130 still to fight for. </p> <p>All the rules have been broken: the number of battleground states up for grabs is even this weekend expanding rather than contracting, forcing the candidates to spread themselves rather than hone in on a slither of voters. The final round is further complicated by the Greens' Ralph Nader, whose ego-maniacal refusal to step down has made him Bush's cherished ally, as he steals votes and time from Gore in the 'swing states'. </p> <p>America was invented in the most crucial of those states, Pennsylvania. Jefferson wrote his declaration in a Philadelphia pub; Lincoln rescued the Union at Gettysburg and industrial barons built the modern nation in Pittsburgh. Fitting, then, that both candidates began their week by blowing through the Keystone State. </p> <p>Bush's speeches were geared to give an aura of inevitable victory. He is not selling a package any longer, he just wants to look like a winner because, in the final hour, that is what people want to back. A curious fact about American elections is that in their aftermath, more people say they voted for the new President than actually did. Bush - although performing to audiences of devotees, Boy Scouts and Christian militants - is sticking to a conservative agenda without using conservative buzzwords. </p> <p>Gore, breezing into Pittsburgh from West Virginia, toured the heartland of the old industrial economy talking about the new one, promising 10 million high-tech jobs in the next decade. Then he nipped to California for some defensive work in the state he must and should win, and to record a Jay Leno talk show. </p> <p>Here we saw the man who wrote his degree thesis on how politicians use television: Gore quipped that voters were like a person with a sick dog, deciding whether to go to the vet or the taxidermist. 'Either way, you get your dog back.' </p> <p>Bush also swung to the West Coast, tearing up the San Andreas fault line faster than any earthquake could, and seeking to rupture California with its biggest on record - a victory for himself. In Oregon, he struck his favourite note: 'Tell them I'm from the West. Okay, it's West Texas. But Texas is a whole lot closer to Oregon than Washington DC.' </p> <p>Riding the general distrust of government, Bush talks about 'Washington' not as a place but a concept, a cabal operating against the interests of 'the people'. Absent from this construct, however, are the size of his spending programme, his own roots in the Northeastern aristocracy and the fact that the wheels driving him to next Tuesday could not have been better oiled than by the Texas-Washington axis. </p> <p>Gore followed the fault line, too, turning one of Bush's favourite lines against him - 'class warfare on behalf of billionaires' - and making voters aware of 'the big choice' facing them, as well he might so far as the rival manifestos are concerned. He joked that he would go to a Hallowe'en party as 'his own man - no mask'. It's his favourite line, but also a bitter one. </p> <p>Gore should by rights win this election - and still could, riding as he does on a magic carpet of unprecedented national well-being. And for a moment during this campaign he held victory in the palms of his hands, but let it slip. That was in Los Angeles, at the Democratic Convention in August, when he was - for once, and as he kept saying - 'his own man'. </p> <p>But Gore's history is one of allowing himself to be moulded and packaged, and after LA he reverted to type. Rather than stick to his newly assertive self-confidence, Gore followed the spinners' instructions and was once again lost between his 'nerd' and his Sopranos acts, neither of which is popular with the voters. Only last week did he again found his authenticity - the premium quality in this election. </p> <p>Next stop, Florida - a contested, glittering prize with Bush this time under pressure, struggling to rally his own faithful. Gore departed the Sunshine State leaving behind his (importantly elderly and Jewish) deputy, Joe Lieberman, returning again to Pennsylvania as Bush made another sweep across the Midwest. </p> <p>'The Shrub' had breezed through Chicago and was in Iowa by the time a drunken driving conviction had been awkwardly (and potentially explosively) revealed, while Gore also hit the Windy City - via New Mexico - in time to find the newsstands splattered with an Esquire cover showing his former boss snapped at crotch level, blue tie pointing towards the organ that kept Ken Starr busy for so long. </p> <p>Over the weekend, the pace will quicken; more Florida, more West Coast, more Midwest, more swing states. Why this frantic, and this close? The answer lies, for the most part, in demographic uncertainties. More than any past election, this one charts the new political map of America, one in which huge swaths of new 'Major Metro' areas are swinging some states for the Democrats, while former bastions of rural liberalism turn to the Republicans. </p> <p>Bush's father won 61 per cent of Florida in 1988, with Gore now showing a narrow lead. New Jersey, once a key 'swing' state, is safely Democratic. Even Ronald Reagan's California should finally settle for Gore. These are states of urban and suburban sprawl - now peaked - where issues like abortion choice and gun control are popular among the 'waitress moms' and their families, important to this election. </p> <p>Meanwhile: Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, West Virginia and others won by Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988 are either contested or lining up for Bush: they are religious states, independent and bloody-minded, and offended by the Clinton administration. And in between are the places where this election will be won and lost: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Missouri. Until Tuesday, it won't be quite clear who the new demographic map favours. </p> <p>The fact that the Democrats are not poised for any certain victory - White House, Senate or House - is itself a historical anomaly, given the state of the economy and the cultural, generational values set by the Clinton years. </p> <p>As a potential Bush victory, Election 2000 is rather like a reversal of 1976 - a blip won by Jimmy Carter during a period of Republican hegemony, with things put back to rights by the election of Reagan four years later. </p> <p>The seeds of the Democrats' problems at a time they should be riding a roller-coaster were sown during the second Clinton administration: the distractions of scandal and impeachment, but more importantly the inability of that administration to turn its victory of 1996 into an unassailable, popular majority politics consolidating the white working class, urban and rural - a failure on which Bush now rides. </p> <p>The other reasons for the dead heat are the candidates and campaigns themselves. There are two prisms through which to look at Bush: you can either see him as the man who spent more money than any other politician in history, only to squander it along with a 17-point lead - or else the man whom the punditocracy backs to be elected President next Tuesday. Behind Bush's success - first and foremost - there is money, as there always has been. All his ventures in business, from oil drilling to the Texas Rangers baseball team, were underwritten and invariably bailed out by big tycoons who were anxious to lubricate their connections to his father. </p> <p>This created the financial base for his governorship of the oil kingdom of Texas, and eventually the present campaign. It was Republican big money that sought out George Bush for this moment, not the other way round. </p> <p>For that reason, the machine sponsoring Bush forgives him everything, even brazen draft-dodging during the Vietnam War (supposed to be the sacred measurement of a man in conservative circles) and even bare-faced lies about his service record after he jumped a line of 100,000 to join the Texas National Guard instead. These things have thus far not mattered, for the packaged Bush is, more than anything, a personification of interests. The drink-drive revelation, however, comes late and is up to the public, not the party, to judge. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.algore2000.com</a><br> <a href=\"http:// www.georgebush.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.georgebush.com</a> <br>Official sites for the leading candidates  <a href=\"http://www.nadertrader.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.nadertrader.org</a> Vote-swapping website for Nader <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/Election2000\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gallup.com/Election2000</a> Opinion polls <a href=\"http://www.gwbush.com  www.algore-2000.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.gwbush.com www.algore-2000.org</a> Spoof sites</p>",
  "<p>Only in cyberspace. Pop icon Madonna wakes up one morning to find her name is being used as a web address for a hardcore porn site. The material girl, livid at the outrageous idea of her name being linked to sex, starts legal action to retrieve the address - only to find that the budding pornographer who owns it, in a fit of pique at losing something that cost him $20,000, is offering it for gratis to the Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital, Lincoln, Nebraska. </p> <p>But last month, after a series of legal manoeuvres, the singer retrieved the domain name after arguing that she had been using the Madonna name professionally since 1979. A spokesman for the hospital said: 'We are devastated. We wanted the name because it would have meant people could find us easily and for its religious connotations.' </p> <p>The Madonna case highlights the legal complexities at the heart of the internet. Addresses are arranged hierarchically by the Domain Name System (DNS) - the global database established to facilitate navigation around the web. But the problem is that as the web expands, the DNS is finding it increasingly difficult to cope. All the good dotcom domain name addresses have been bought, and there is an urgent need to create more. </p> <p>There are more than 30 million registered domain names in the world, of which more than half end in the '.com' - denoting that they are commercial sites. By 2002 this number will have doubled on current projections. Some experts even go as high as 75m. But a failure to address this problem will have a profoundly negative impact on the way the web develops. </p> <p>David Post, Associate Professor of Law at Temple University Law School in the US, argues that sorting out this problem is a 'life-or-death' matter for internet companies. 'If your name and address cannot be found... you simply do not exist - at least, not on the internet.' </p> <p>Sorting out the problem is the job of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann), formed two years ago by the US Department of Commerce. Icann has been praised for dealing effectively with problems involving so-called 'cyber-squatting' - when individuals attempt to profit from a company or personal trademark by buying up related domain names (such as in the Madonna case). Since the arbitration system set up to resolve such issues was established last December, Icann has been inundated with more than 1,800 complaints. </p> <p>'It's doing a difficult job as fast as it can. I think the US government must be pretty pleased,' said Philip Atkinson, head of intellectual property at Eversheds law firm. </p> <p>But this is where the plaudits stop. </p> <p>In a bid to satisfy soaring demand for domain names, Icann has pledged to release a new batch, which will perhaps - and the emphasis is on perhaps - include endings such as '.web', '.firm', '.info' and '.shop', allowing for greater differentiation between addresses. </p> <p>There is only one hitch. The whole system is in chaos. Icann has been pledging such a move for most of this year and has consistently postponed making a decision. News was expected this summer. Then in the autumn. Educated guesses now say it won't be until early next year before there is any progress. </p> <p>The escalating delay has caused some companies that specialise in selling domain names to start the process without Icann. They are already allowing people to sign up, speculatively, for new names, despite the fact that no one knows what these will be. Punters are handing over non-refundable fees of \u00a310 or \u00a320 simply to register their interest in a new top-level domain name such as ones which end in '.bank' or '.eu.' 'It's a complete scam', was the verdict of one domain name expert. </p> <p>Last month, in a case that smacked very much of closing the stable door after the horse had bolted, Icann put out a statement warning speculators of the pitfalls associated with their actions. This was seen as symptomatic of the way Icann now functions. </p> <p>'The perception is that the industry has moved on and Icann hasn't. It's been inactive with regards to a lot of policy concerns. It's more of a think-tank with no real bite,' said Nik Imrie, marketing and web development manager with Domains.com, one of the world's largest domain name registries. </p> <p>Some Icann supporters say the reason the release of the new batch of domain names was delayed was due to technical fears - there would be too many new names swamping the system for a roll-out to work effectively. </p> <p>Icann is now talking about operating something called a 'sunrise policy', which will allow the largest companies (such as FTSE 100 firms) to buy up the domain names relating to them first, in a bid to smooth the path and avoid further cyber-squatting wrangles. </p> <p>But this will also bring problems. Icann is already considered public enemy number one by many internet aficionados who see it as an oligarchy hell-bent on regulating cyberspace to ensure its own preservation. 'How can we be assured that Icann will be able to resist pressures to stray beyond [its] \"technical\" mandate? Where are the checks on the new corporation's exercise of power?' Post asked in a scathing article posted on the internet. </p> <p>Indeed, the whole Icann structure is seen by many as representing the antithesis of the internet. 'We really must ask whether we really want or need this kind of global internet policy,' states a stern press release on the website for the pressure group Icann Watch. </p> <p>In addition to Icann's perceived powers there is a concern that it is merely a mouthpiece for the US government. 'There is a real fear that Icann places American law over other countries' laws - even for many operations entirely within these countries,' said Simon Moores of the Research Group, an internet consultancy. </p> <p>In a bid to answer its critics Icann recently tried to make itself more democratic and accountable. In March the organisation stated that its board of nine unelected directors was to be replaced by an 18-member elected council. </p> <p>But this process has degenerated into high farce. Only five elected members are so far on board and four of the original directors are refusing to quit. Now Icann is being torn apart by infighting. One of the recently elected appointees, Karl Auerbach, wants Icann's president, Mike Roberts, sacked. Auerbach says he finds it impossible to say 'anything positive about' Roberts. Another elected Icann director, Andy M\u00fcller-Maguhn, a German hacker who belongs to the famous Chaos Computer Club, has also been scathing about the way Icann is run. </p> <p>The organisation's failure to deliver on its promise to be more accountable prompted Michael Froomkin, a Miami University law professor who specialises in analysing the legality of government agencies, to declare that Icann is 'an essentially unaccountable private body that many feel has already abused its authority in at least small ways and is indisputably capable of abusing it in big ways'. </p> <p>It seems that, while Icann might be successful in sorting out the minor problems - such as getting Madonna her domain name back - it faces tremendous problems grappling with the bigger issues and is in danger of falling apart. Icann chairwoman Esther Dyson, one of Silicon Valley's most famous entrepreneurs, is set to quit this month. Expect further pyrotechnics soon.</p>",
  "<p>The timing is perfect. Just 48 hours before Chancellor Gordon Brown delivers what will probably be the last Pre-Budget Report before the general election, he faces business leaders at the Confederation of British Industry conference. </p> <p>If next year's March Budget is to provide Brown with a chance to charm the electorate with tax cuts, this week's report will be about getting UK plc firmly on his side. And with Treasury coffers overflowing with a larger than predicted surplus, the CBI audience in Birmingham will be expecting goodies. </p> <p>Director-General Digby Jones says: 'We believe that government could give some \u00a33 billion back to business.' </p> <p>Despite wobbles over manufacturing, the CBI and the Government have been riding in tandem. Since Jones's appointment last January, the CBI has been banging the drum for increased transport spending. 'We were delighted by the wonderful decision to invest \u00a3180bn on transport,' says Jones. 'If we're going to be more productive, we've got to get our goods to market.' </p> <p>The employers' leader warned against a resumption of the fuel protests because they 'won't work', will make a poor impression on investors and 'hurt wealth creation'. </p> <p>The pro-euro campaign by the CBI was handily placed on a backburner soon after Jones's arrival. He says: 'The Government's European policy is going down the right lines'. The current imperative is to iron out the workings of the single market, a view that will be echoed in the Chancellor's speech tomorrow. </p> <p>Jones even invokes the Treasury terminology about not returning the economy to 'boom and bust'. </p> <p>But aside from the mantra of macroeconomic stability, it is the UK's poor productivity that has preoccupied previous pre-Budget statements. Indeed this week's statement, to be entitled 'Building Long-term Prosperity for All', will set out the Government's approach to dealing with this medium-term question. </p> <p>And although the CBI has promised to work with the Government to tackle the productivity gap, their immediate approaches will differ. </p> <p>The employers will launch a major initiative to cut the red tape and regulation stifling the growth of small businesses. The Government, it says, has swamped firms with 16 new pieces of employment legislation since coming to power. 'We don't want any more,' says Jones. He wants Brown to 'walk the walk' after talking about getting government out of the way where its actions harm business. </p> <p>For the Chancellor, the report, aside from petrol and pensioners, will be about reviving entrepreneurship to energise economically de-funct urban areas, uniting the productivity and social justice agendas. </p> <p>But Brown, his pockets overflowing with as much as \u00a315bn in loose change, will be pressed to grant some form of tax cut to businesses. </p> <p>Tax competition has taken off across Europe, with Germany, Italy and France slashing companies' burdens to attract investment. International comparisons of the tax burden, however, show the UK faring reasonably well. </p> <p>Instead, the report will again focus on Brown's favoured business constituency: the revered hi-tech entrepreneurs, particularly those with a social conscience. There will be more microeconomic tinkering with tax credits to provide incentives for research and development, and skills investment. This follows a well-trodden path of micro adjustments to encourage productivity improvements. </p> <p>Following the recent Cohen report on 'social investment', there will be tax breaks to encourage venture capital and start-ups in deprived urban areas. </p> <p>Stamp duty on 'brownfield' developments is expected to be abolished, as recommended by Lord Rogers's Urban Task Force. </p> <p>The CBI's immediate priorities lie elsewhere, but it is not out of tune with this agenda. Jones says his organisation wants 'socially inclusive wealth creation', with more money and more control over planning for regional development agencies. </p> <p>This moves in the same direction: trying to prepare fertile ground for small businesses to grow in new industries. Many of the areas in need of regeneration, however, have suffered because of the decline of large-scale manufacturing. </p> <p>'Old economy' business leaders will want proof that their understated role in the development of new technology and higher productivity will be fully recognised, particularly after the dampening of dotcom fever. </p> <p>Employee share ownership may be less attractive now that the hi-tech sector has taken a pasting. But the long- awaited reform of approved share options schemes will be launched in the report. The current limit of 15 employees is expected to be lifted, and the total tax-free limit expanded to \u00a32.5m per company. Such schemes will allow all employees to share in the stellar performance of a listed small business. </p> <p>Business groups, however, are lobbying for a bolder move. The Computer and Software Services Association, for example, seeks a blanket simplification of the scheme featuring a basic rule on how long options need to be held to justify tax breaks. Such schemes now need to be approved by the Inland Revenue. Whenever the Chancellor gives to business with one narrowly targeted hand, as in this case, he invariably takes something back through extra red tape. </p> <p>As a rule of thumb, any tax breaks so specifically targeted need to be verified to prevent abuse, so adding to the complexity of the system. But in this case the stringent tax-avoidance rules affected the flexibility of high growth start-ups to offer capital stakes, rather than their dwindling cash funds, to attract and retain staff. </p> <p>Brown may decide this bureaucratic burden is relatively small beer compared to the low taxes paid by companies. Another factor is that the TUC, which lent crucial support to the Government during the fuel crisis, opposes the CBI's anti-red tape campaign, viewing the move as an attempt to restrict employees' rights. </p> <p>The employers also want the Chancellor to review the climate change levy, remove stamp duty on stock exchange transactions and make a major cut in vehicle excise duty on lorries. </p> <p>They are making a general plea for greater consultation on the minutiae of policy - a return to the original rationale for the pre-Budget report as the basis for at least four months' policy discussion. The single biggest cause of business distress, the strong pound, will not be the subject of consultation. Indeed exchange-rate woes and skills shortages are seen, in the Government's unspoken policy, as a spur to UK plc to use innovative technology and good management to get the most out of workers. Two years ago the UK exporters claimed the bearable DM exchange rate was 2.70. It now says that DM3 would not be too bad. That, and the trade surplus with the EU, shows manufacturers are making headway on productivity. </p> <p>But that is a medium and long-term challenge helped by public investment in transport and education. Right now, profit warnings are on the increase, the election is near and it is essential to retain business confidence. </p> <p>The Chancellor may rule out a return to the old short- termism, but perhaps this week will see the emergence of a politically expedient 'new' short-termism. </p> <p><strong>The CBI's wish list</strong><br>\u0095 Tax cuts of up to \u00a33bn to ease rising business costs </p> <p> \u0095 Slash red tape </p> <p> \u0095 Improve consultation on tax changes </p> <p> \u0095 Lower cost to business of road transport before next Budget </p> <p> \u0095 Reconsider National Insurance on unapproved share options </p> <p><strong>TUC</strong><br>\u0095 Pensions, not petrol </p> <p> \u0095 Increase in basic state pension </p> <p> \u0095 Age-related supplement for over-75s </p> <p> \u0095 Regional manufacturing aid fund, similar to the \u00a31.6bn agriculture fund </p> <p> \u0095 No justification for across-the-board tax cuts </p> <p><strong>IoD</strong><br>\u0095 Lighten tax and regulatory load on business </p> <p> \u0095 Abandon plans for Employment tax credit </p> <p> \u0095 1p a litre cut in fuel duties </p> <p> \u0095 A cap on the the tax/GDP ratio </p> <p>\u0095 Maintain fiscal prudence </p> <p><strong>Computer and Software Services Association</strong><br>\u0095 Review National Insurance on unapproved share options </p> <p> \u0095 Expand and simplify approved share-option schemes </p> <p> \u0095 Reform IR35 to protect solo contractors </p> <p><strong>Assorted fuel lobbies and hauliers</strong><br>\u0095 26p off fuel duty, but would settle for 15p </p> <p> \u0095 Reduction in Vehicle Excise Duty </p> <p> \u0095 Foreign hauliers to pay special tax for using UK roads </p> <p><strong>National Pensioners' Convention</strong><br>\u0095 Substantial increase in the basic state pension to make up for the \u00a330 a week that pensioners have lost since the earnings link was abolished in 1980 </p> <p> \u0095 Restoration of the earnings link</p>",
  "<p>When NewsCorp officials gathered in the Hong Kong convention centre last March to unveil their latest Chinese internet investment, a tall woman handed out a business card that read 'News Corporation/Wendi Deng Murdoch'. </p> <p>Deng is not a NewsCorp employee. Once a junior executive at the company's Star TV in Hong Kong, Deng, 31, quit her post before marrying NewsCorp chairman Rupert Murdoch last year. Since then, she has been portrayed - by Murdoch and the company - as a traditional housewife who attends to decorating, her husband's diet and the like. </p> <p>But Deng is no homebody. Though she doesn't have a formal position with her husband's media empire, she has quickly asserted her influence over NewsCorp's operations and investments in Asia, its most important growth market. </p> <p>Working with her stepson, James Murdoch, 27, Deng has initiated or advocated Chinese internet investments totalling between $35 million and $45m, according to a top NewsCorp executive. With her advice, the company has also formed partnerships with cable companies in the region looking to upgrade their systems for high-speed video and internet access. </p> <p>Murdoch, who is 69, has never hesitated to put family members to work in his businesses. Last month, he named his eldest son, Lachlan, 29, deputy chief operating officer, in a move partly aimed at clarifying that he is his father's heir. James serves as chief executive of Star TV and has carved out Asia and the internet as his province. Even Murdoch's ex-wife, Anna Mann, whom he divorced last year, has an office and assistant at NewsCorp's New York offices, although she no longer has an active role with the company. </p> <p>Now, Deng is rising to a place of prominence in the family business. </p> <p>People within NewsCorp and outsiders involved in the Chinese internet and media industries say she identifies potential investments for her husband's company and acts as his liaison and translator in China. </p> <p>These people say Deng is well suited for this unusual role. The daughter of a factory director in Guangzhou, China, Deng came to the US 12 years ago with the aid of a California couple. The husband in that couple later left his wife for Deng. She mastered English, climbed from a California college to Yale's business school and eventually landed at Star TV in Hong Kong. </p> <p>Having left China in obscurity as a teenager, Deng is now returning in grand style, as the wife and adviser of a global media baron. </p> <p>'Wendi gives NewsCorp a Chinese face in China,' says Joseph Ravitch, co-head of the global media practice at Goldman Sachs Group, which advises NewsCorp on its Asia strategy. 'She represents not just the company but the owner, and that's critical in a country where families are very important.' </p> <p>Murdoch has long been fascinated by the potential of the Chinese market, and his Fox studio was a pioneer in the country. But at times, he has seemed to lack the feel for subtleties his wife is said to have. In 1993, shortly after he acquired control of Star TV, Murdoch made a still-notorious remark that satellite TV would prove 'an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere'. China immediately retaliated by banning private ownership of satellite dishes. Reception by private households of Star TV and its affiliate, Phoenix Satellite Television, remains illegal in China, though many cable operators and residential compounds defy the ban and carry the channels. </p> <p>Murdoch gradually repaired relations with the Chinese. He pulled the BBC from Star TV, making the channel more palatable to the Beijing government. He sold the South China Morning Post to a pro-Beijing businessman. And at his behest, NewsCorp's HarperCollins publishing unit killed a book contract with the last governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten. Today, NewsCorp's officially restricted Phoenix channel is a favourite among urban Chinese households, and the company has greater access to the mainland market than any of its competitors. </p> <p>With the exception of an odd mention in the newspaper gossip pages or a glossy magazine photo spread, Deng has stayed out of the public eye. She accompanies Murdoch on his worldwide jaunts and stayed at his side when he received prostate cancer treatment last summer. </p> <p>Shortly after they were married in June 1999, Murdoch told Vanity Fair magazine that his relationship with his new wife precluded her from working for NewsCorp. Instead Deng was 'busy working on decorating the new apartment' in Manhattan. He said his bride, a graduate of the Yale School of Management, was 'a bit frustrated' by the narrow scope of her activities, adding, 'We'll just have to resolve that somehow'. </p> <p>The resolution has taken Deng far beyond choosing upholstery. She has become a de facto diplomat on behalf of NewsCorp in China, a country where good relations with government officials is critical to success. Over the past year, she has met with politicians from President Jiang Zemin down. In one of her few answers to written questions, Deng said she had met the Chinese president only at large gatherings on 'formal occasions'. Deng also said she hadn't initiated any meetings with 'top level' Chinese government officials. </p> <p>In recent months, Deng has appeared with increasing frequency at the side of her husband and stepson James in NewsCorp business meetings. She sometimes intervenes to smooth over potentially awkward situations. In March, for example, she and the father-and-son Murdoch team met a well-connected Chinese businessman in Shanghai, in the hope of advancing NewsCorp's push into the Chinese TV market. The meeting got off to an uncomfortable start, at least partly because of the language barrier between the Murdoch men and their host, according to a participant. But Deng used her bilingual fluency to put everyone at ease,. </p> <p>Deng has become deeply involved in the company's analysis and negotiation of business transactions in China, according to people who have dealt extensively with NewsCorp. Entrepreneurs trying to interest the company in their ideas often go first to Deng, according to a person close to NewsCorp She has told this person she sometimes receives more than 100 emails a day from Chinese people with business proposals. She sometimes meets entrepreneurs at NewsCorp's offices in Beijing or at one of the city's business- gathering spots, such as the St Regis bar. </p> <p>NewsCorp executives say that among the deals Deng has helped forge is a recent multimillion-dollar company investment in Netease.com, one of the most popular web portals that target the mainland. Earlier this year, she worked with James Murdoch to negotiate NewsCorp's investment of more than $10m in the Chinese-language internet company renren.com, according to Anthony Cheng, founder of the website. Cheng recalls that at one meeting about renren.com, Deng displayed her deep involvement when she grilled him on the difference between the site's marketing strategies in Beijing and Shanghai. She calls him with ideas from time to time on how to improve his company, Cheng adds. 'She's very keyed into all the News Corp and Star TV properties and how to better link them,' he says. </p> <p>Deng initiated News Corp's investment last December in SinoBIT.com, a Beijing website that seeks to link entrepreneurs to investors online, according to Steve Sun, the site's co-founder. She did so by introducing Sun, whom she knew through mutual friends from Yale, to James Murdoch, Sun says. At the same time, people who have done business with Deng say she appears to take great pains not to overstep her unofficial role. Sun notes, for example, that she didn't attend a second meeting between him and James Murdoch, at which the terms of the investment in SinoBIT.com were finalised. 'She gave James the right to make the decision,' Sun says. </p> <p>Deng hasn't neglected the business of minding Murdoch, who has undergone the kind of change in appearance often associated with a man's marrying a much younger wife. </p> <p>Murdoch for decades preferred establishment addresses such as New York's Upper East Side and Bel Air in Los Angeles. But after remarrying, he and Deng set up home in Manhattan's trendy SoHo district, a few blocks from the apartment of Murdoch's son, Lachlan. Known for his British-style double-breasted business suits, the older Murdoch started sporting black turtlenecks. NewsCorp executives say that sometimes he even forgoes a tie at the office, once unthinkable. He told Vanity Fair he is pumping iron with a personal trainer at 6am and downing a morning concoction of fruit and soy protein. </p> <p>When Deng began appearing at Murdoch's side about two years ago, NewsCorp executives wondered where she had come from and how she got there. They knew nothing about her other than that she joined Star TV as an intern in 1996, shortly after obtaining an MBA from Yale. Deng herself hasn't commented in the press about her background. </p> <p>Born Deng Wen Di, in the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou, her parents later moved to the southern city of Guangzhou. Deng was the family name. She later compressed her Chinese first name into 'Wendi'. Deng's father served as director of a machinery factory in Guangzhou. The family lived in a three-bedroom apartment, unusually large by Chinese standards. Wendi Deng has two sisters and one brother. A good student and champion volleyball player, Deng had enrolled in Guangzhou Medical College by the age of 16. </p> <p>Her ticket out of China came in 1987, when she met a Los Angeles couple, Jake and Joyce Cherry. Cherry, then 50, was working in Guangzhou, helping the Chinese to build a factory to make freezers for food-processing plants. The Cherrys' interpreter told them of a young woman who was looking for help with her English. Joyce Cherry, then 42, says she began tutoring the teenager. In the fall of 1987, Joyce Cherry returned to Los Angeles to enrol her two children in elementary school. Cherry stayed in China to finish the factory project. </p> <p>Soon after Joyce Cherry was resettled in Los Angeles, she says, her husband called to say that Deng wanted to come to the US to study. He asked Joyce Cherry to help complete the paperwork and get an application ready for a local college. The Cherrys sponsored Deng's bid for a student visa and agreed to put her up until she had established herself. The 19-year-old arrived at the Cherry home in February of 1988. She shared a bedroom and bunk beds with her hosts' five-year-old daughter. </p> <p>All was not well, however, between the elder Cherrys. Cherry, who arrived home shortly after Deng came to California, had grown physically ill in China from a combination of overwork and poor diet. The spouses' separation had strained the marriage, the Cherrys concur. At the same time, Joyce says she had grown increasingly suspicious about Deng's relationship with her husband. She recalls discovering photographs her husband had taken of Deng in coquettish poses in his hotel room in Guangzhou. Cherry confirms he became infatuated with the young woman. Once they were in Los Angeles, he says, Deng started making recommendations about his diet and wardrobe. </p> <p>When her husband and Deng didn't return home some evenings, Joyce says she concluded they were having an affair. She told Deng to leave, and Cherry left soon afterwards. He moved into a nearby apartment with Deng, who had enrolled at California State University at Northridge, a commuter college in the San Fernando Valley. </p> <p>The Cherrys divorced, and Cherry married Deng in February 1990. But that union didn't last. Cherry says that about four months after the wedding, he told Deng to leave because she had started spending time with a man named David Wolf. Cherry was 53 at the time. Wolf was in his mid-twenties, only a few years older than Deng. Wolf, who declined interview requests, worked in the early Nineties for an import-export company. He spoke some Chinese and was interested in a career in China, according to someone who knew him. </p> <p>Cherry says he and Deng were briefly reconciled at one point, but they split up for good when it became clear she was continuing to see Wolf. 'She told me I was a father concept to her, and it would never be anything else,' Cherry recalls. 'I loved that girl.' </p> <p>Divorce records filed with the Los Angeles County Superior Court show that the Cherry-Deng marriage lasted two years and seven months. That was seven months longer than what was required for Deng to obtain a green card, allowing her permanently to live and work in the US as a resident alien. Cherry says he and Deng actually lived together for 'four to five months, at the most'. They haven't spoken since 1996, he adds. </p> <p>During the early Nineties when she was married to Cherry, and for a time after that, Deng on some occasions introduced the tall, well-dressed Wolf as her husband, according to people who knew Deng. Ken Chapman, a California State economics professor, recalls that the last time he saw his former student, in 1995, she handed him Wolf's business card and said she could be reached through her 'husband'. At 5'10\" herself, Deng and Wolf made a striking couple, according to people who knew them. They shared several addresses during the Nineties and told friends that they had met in China, when Wolf had been there on business. </p> <p>For a time in the early Nineties, the couple worked at a suburban Los Angeles gymnastics academy operated by Li Ning, a Chinese three-times Olympics gold medallist. Deng served as a liaison between the gym's Chinese coaching staff and parents of the school-age clientele; Wolf, as the gym's general manager. Today, Wolf works as a director in the Beijing office of Burson-Marsteller, a large PR firm. </p> <p>In 1996, Deng graduated from Yale and began looking for a job. Through a friend, she met Bruce Churchill, who then oversaw finance and corporate development at NewsCorp's Fox TV unit in Los Angeles. She lacked experience in the entertainment industry, but had an Ivy League business degree and was fluent in English and Mandarin, attributes of particular value to News Corp's struggling Asian satellite service, Star TV. Churchill, who was on his way to Star TV as deputy chief executive, offered Deng an internship in Hong Kong. That grew into a full-time job. </p> <p>Even though Deng was a relatively junior employee, she took an active role in planning Star TV's activities in Hong Kong and China, according to former NewsCorp colleagues. She helped build distribution in China for its Channel V music channel, for example, and explored interactive TV opportunities for the company's News Digital Systems arm. </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch frequently talks to NewsCorp's business development executives around the globe, so it isn't surprising that one day he would cross paths with Deng. In early 1998, she first appeared at his side, acting as his interpreter in Shanghai and Beijing. </p> <p>By that summer, the Star TV staff was buzzing about romance between the pair. After dinner meetings in Hong Kong, they were observed holding hands. In May, Murdoch had separated from his wife of 31 years, Anna. The split surprised even his closest aides, who say they hadn't seen any sign of a rupture. </p> <p>Murdoch told senior Star TV executives in the autumn of 1998 that his relationship with Deng was 'serious'. Star TV's then-chairman, Gareth Chang, told Murdoch at the time that it was a bad idea for Deng to remain on staff, given her personal relationship with the parent company's chairman. That wouldn't be a problem, Murdoch replied, because Deng would be resigning and moving with him to New York. </p> <p>Today, Rupert and Wendi Murdoch spend time not only in SoHo, but also at their home in Bel Air and on a ranch near Carmel, California. Murdoch controls about 30 per cent of NewsCorp, a stake worth roughly $8.7 billion. He has said the stock is owned by trusts that name his three children as beneficiaries. </p> <p>Rupert and Anna Murdoch's divorce became final in June 1999. Negotiations over a divorce settlement dragged on for nearly 12 months, as Anna Murdoch's lawyers tried to determine the extent of NewsCorp's global assets. Financial terms of the settlement weren't made public, but the Murdochs have said they agreed on one crucial point: that their children eventually would gain control of the company. Five months later Anna Murdoch married widower William Mann, chairman of Henry Mann Securities in New York. Rupert Murdoch and Wendi Deng were married on June 25, 1999, 17 days after his divorce became final.</p>",
  "<p>These days you're no one unless you work in public relations. It is edifying to think that although once we may have been a nation of shopkeepers, now we're all PR gurus. And if you need conclusive proof of this argument, even Ofsted chief Chris Woodhead, once the most powerful man in our education system, now thinks PR is the future. He liked the profession so much that he's moving into it. </p> <p>Despite his well known loathing of media studies courses, Woodhead is keen to become a media massager for none other than Bell Pottinger, the PR outfit run by Lord Bell, Lady Thatcher's former bag carrier. He is just the latest in a long run of big names to get the PR bug. </p> <p>Last month MG Rover appointed a big corporate PR firm to bat on its behalf. The West Midlands carmaker was fed up with the media asking annoying questions such as why it was saying one thing in public about the future of Rover and another in private. </p> <p>Beleaguered Railtrack - and its even more beleaguered chief executive, Gerald Corbett - has more PR advisers than you can shake a broken sleeper at. Following the Hatfield crash it brought in more help. And, in addition to employing two City PR firms, the company's internal communications chief is Sue Clark, who is considered to be one of the slickest operators in the business. Clark became famous in the PR industry for continuing to relate with the public in her previous job, even when her waters had broken and contractions had begun. </p> <p>Last week it was the turn of the European Central Bank to discover the joys of PR. The ECB is to spend \u00a348 million on a campaign to prepare EU citizens for the joys of euro notes and coins. The fact that news of the campaign came in the wake of the euro's continued slide south is, of course, purely coincidental. </p> <p>Spot a pattern? There seems to be some sort of inverse correlation emerging here. Essentially, the worse a company or organisation is doing the more it surrounds itself with PR advisers. In future years City analysts wanting to take the pulse of a business may not need to bother doing a spot of discounted cash flow analysis: they'll simply check out the size of the PR team. The bigger the team, the more sickly the company, analysts could be forgiven for thinking. </p> <p>But, of course, the truth will always out in the end. Take just one example. GTech, the US lottery giant, had one of the most powerful and, in fact, downright scary PR teams around. Its disdain for the media was huge. But its reputation now lies in tatters, having tried unsuccessfully to hide a catalogue of errors, and no amount of message massaging is going to change that now. You can paper over the cracks for only so long. </p> <p>One company which knew a fair bit about PR was the Hartford Group, owner of London's very trendy Pharmacy restaurant. The company, part owned by the \u00fcber spin-meister Matthew Freud, burst into the limelight two years ago and has looked back ever since. </p> <p>Last week it unveiled an operating loss of more than \u00a31.6m and was forced to write down the value of two of its restaurants, Congress and Idaho. In addition, its expansion plans at two other sites have been put on hold. Needless to say the company's shares have performed abysmally since it floated amid much hype. </p> <p>Hartford is not alone. Belgo, the Belgian-themed mussels and frites chain which also owns a clutch of prestigious restaurants such as Le Caprice, has also taken a battering. Two years ago its share price stood at nearly 12p. It's now a third of that. Groupe Chez Gerard's shares were changing hands at nearly 270p at one stage last year. They are now worth only just over half that. </p> <p>But it's not just the trendy, upmarket sector which is taking a battering. Last week, middle-of-the-road Caf\u00e9 Rouge, owned by Whitbread, announced that it is to close 35 of its 103 restaurants. Whitbread's other big name restaurant chain, TGI Friday's, reported half year profits down 6 per cent on the previous year. Last Thursday it was revealed that Pizza Express was considering a hostile bid for City Centre Restaurants, which has seen its share price collapse following a profits warning. </p> <p>Pessimists in this sector might be forgiven for interpreting the welter of bad news as proof that good times do not lie ahead. The simple fact is that there are just too many restaurants for too few people. A shake-out could be on the cards.</p>",
  "<p>To ensure Britain's homes are watertight and its transport system trouble-free during future floods will cost billions of pounds, leading civil engineers and water managers are warning. </p> <p>Years of under-investment and short-term profiteering by the big housebuilders, rail companies and local councils have left Britain unable to deal with extreme weather. </p> <p>And we will have to play a massive game of catch-up if flood defences are to be sufficiently robust. </p> <p>\u0095 Roads may have to be dug up to fit drainage suction pumps which should have been installed when they were first built. </p> <p>\u0095 Tens of millions of pounds will have be spent shoring up electricity pylons and overhead electrical rail cables. </p> <p>\u0095 A major redesign of housebuilding methods could cost up to \u00a3150 million per year, adding thousands to the price of a new home. </p> <p>\u0095 Additional safety measures for tall buildings will also be introduced, adding to the rent burden of UK businesses. </p> <p>Of course, sceptics argue that five years ago droughts forced the water industry to consider piping water to eastern parts of Britain which were suffering severe shortages. Wait another five years and droughts will be back, they say. </p> <p>But a growing body of scientific evidence, culminating last Wednesday in a detailed European Commission report, suggests the effects in Britain of global warming will mean more sustained bursts of intense rainfall. So what are we going to do about it and how much will it cost? </p> <p>The Government's first move will be to restrict the building of new homes on flood plains. Possibly too little, too late. </p> <p>The Environment Agency (EA), which claims it is \u00a3100m million a year underfunded, says that there are 1.8m homes and 135,000 commercial premises in Britain built on flood plains. These are worth \u00a335 billion and were built mainly in the Seventies and Eighties. Of the four million new homes likely to be built by 2016, it is estimated that a quarter are zoned for flood plains. </p> <p>For example, up to 20,000 new homes are planned south-east of Ashford, Kent, close to the River Stour. This is an attractive location, but pressure is already on to get those homes shifted away from what is a hazardous area. </p> <p>'When I saw the site, I thought, \"Bloody hell, that's the last thing we want\",' said Geoff Mance, director of water management at the EA. In addition, many of the 33,000 homes that are planned in Sussex could be at risk. </p> <p>But a new planning policy guidance note from the Department of the Environment, likely to be issued within four months, will not ban flood plain development outright. Housebuilders have successfully argued that this would force up the price of land in risk-free areas at a time when the housing market has been rocketing for four years. In addition, pressure for new homes is intense, particularly in the flood-risk area of the South East. </p> <p>'A permanent ban of flood plain development might inhibit long-term alleviation methods,' argued Roger Lewis, director of the Berkeley Group, a leading housebuilder. Suggested 'alleviation methods' centre on the design of homes. These include the use of masonry walls instead of plasterboard which is cheaper but turns to mush when flooded. </p> <p>Homes may also have to use ground floors as storage space and lofts as living space. This will also offer better heat efficiency. Suspended floors allowing water to flood harmlessly under homes are also suggested. </p> <p>All new housing developments may soon have porous pavements and drives allowing rainwater to escape. Balancing ponds, which effectively catch rainwater, are increasingly a landscaped feature in new developments. </p> <p>'These techniques all make sense but they will add over \u00a310,000 to the price of an average house. It is a question of how much of this builders will pass on to the end-user,' said one senior executive of a mass volume housebuilder. </p> <p>'The trouble is we can't be totally sure that this intense weather is here to stay. What will force our hand is if insurers put premiums out of the reach of housebuilders unless we adopt these measures.' </p> <p>If new construction methods cost \u00a310,000 a house, a rough cost to housebuilders would be \u00a31.5bn a year, since there are more than 150,000 new homes built each year. </p> <p>For offices, particularly converted warehouses by rivers, the agency suggests placing canteens, meeting rooms or reception on the ground floor and basement. </p> <p>'Telephone switchboards, boilers and computers should be upstairs,' said the EA's Mance. 'We're trying to get the Government to include these suggestions in new building regulations. The idea is that if a business gets flooded it can start up again quickly.' </p> <p>The real battle to be fought, though, is to ensure that Britain's coasts and rivers have strong enough defences to withstand intense rainfall without compromising the environment. </p> <p>Today, \u00a3250m a year is spent on flood defence by the EA, which is funded by local councils as well as the Government. Despite a \u00a310m increase for three years starting next year, the agency is still underfunded. This is mainly because local authorities do not always pay into EA's pot. </p> <p>Flood Minister Elliot Morley said the situation was particularly bad in the South West: 'The Government is considering ring-fencing local authority money for flood defence.' </p> <p>The technology to counter flooding has not really changed for centuries: flood walls made either from concrete or soil are the main weapon. These suffer from seepage if not maintained and concrete walls also damage water ecology. </p> <p>To control water levels on rivers, sluices or low-lying dams are used to keep water back. But this can cause a build-up of water upstream. </p> <p>Similar methods are used to protect our coasts with defences generally made of sand or shingle. These will have to be taller. Creating beaches, which help to dissipate the effects of high tides, may have to be considered. </p> <p>'It's impossible to say how much the creating of new flood walls and their maintenance will cost,' said Terry Oakes, a leading independent consultant in water management. 'The industry has been pressing the Government for more money for a number of years. The new money announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review is not sufficient and there is a 12-month lead time. </p> <p>'Ministers' top priority is to prevent loss of life rather than avoiding flooding in the first place.' </p> <p>Britain's sewerage system - also the means by which urban floodwater is drained - is the responsibility of the privatised water industry and in need of urgent overhaul. Many sewers are more than 100 years old and will cost tens of millions to upgrade. </p> <p>To ensure Britain's rail network does not grind to a halt following strong winds and flooding would cost billions of pounds. Apart from unacceptable amounts of tree clearance, wholesale rewiring of the electrified network would be needed. This is out of the question. </p> <p>Instead, basic measures to shore up overhead rail cables in vulnerable areas, particularly on the East Coast mainline which is said to have been built on the cheap, would cost about \u00a320m, say transport experts. </p> <p>Critics say the road network has clearly been unable to cope with the weather of the last three weeks. Major roads built recently should have had drainage suction pumps underneath but these have been cut to save money. In any case, some roads with them failed to drain in last week's crisis. One transport expert said a suction pump that failed last week on London's North Circular Road had been checked just six weeks ago. </p> <p>Meanwhile, local authorities, starved of cash, have not been able to invest in suction-tank lorries. 'Where are these lorries?' said one South West councillor. 'We haven't got one. It's a legacy of the relentless financial pressure we're under. We can't justify servicing a machine we may only use once every 10 years.' </p> <p>If, despite the wringing of hands and purposeful Government rhetoric, there isn't even the cash for the occasional lorry, what chance is there of any other remedies? </p> <p><strong>Stormy weather - counting the cost of the deluge</strong></p> <p> * Last week's flood, which has swamped more than 3,000 homes, is now more extensive than the great flood of 1947 - the most devastating of recent times - when 750,000 acres were affected </p> <p>* The Meteorological Office has indicated that the UK is likely to face more intense storms </p> <p>* Insurance premiums may rise in flood-risk areas </p> <p>* Insurers have warned that householders in high-risk areas may be refused cover unless flood measures are implemented </p> <p>* Weather-related claims cost the insurance industry \u00a3860m last year </p> <p>* The insurance bill for this storm is estimated at \u00a3500m </p> <p>* Train operators are losing \u00a32m a day in income from fewer travellers and compensation payouts </p> <p>* Five million people live in flood-risk areas in England and Wales </p> <p>* Before the recent deluge 25 people in the UK had died in 30 separate flooding incidents during the past two years </p> <p>* The Environment Agency's Floodline is 0845 9881188</p>",
  "<p>The death of Sir Steven Runciman, the historian, brings back a memory of the bad old days. By this I do not mean the Crusades and the Fall of Constantinople, on which Runciman was the acknowledged authority, but the bad old days of the Seventies and early Eighties. In those days 'wildcat' strikes were two a penny, and we newspapermen never quite knew whether the paper would be published or wrecked by what was known quaintly as 'industrial action'. </p> <p>At all events, I was at a conference in Cyprus which was examining 'The impact of the enlargement of the European Economic Community on the Cyprus economy'. The year was 1979. Margaret Thatcher had just been elected, and there was either a strike, or a threat of strike, at the Times. The man from the Times and I were having a drink with Runciman (who was providing the historical perspective on the EEC). Suddenly Runciman leant down and said: 'Did you say you were from the Times ? Well let me tell you something. I have devoted my entire career to my Times obituary, and I do not propose to kick the bucket while you are on strike.' </p> <p>Runciman died last Wednesday aged 97. He saw through the entire Thatcher period and a lot more besides. A glowing obituary duly appeared on Thursday. Among other things it reminded us that Runciman emphasised the other side of the story, and saw the English and other crusaders as barbarians. </p> <p>We are now reaping the other side of the Thatcher contribution to history. She has been widely praised for dealing with the unions - no strikes to ruin Runciman's obituary - and her guaranteed footnote in history will contain something about 'privatisation' and 'deregulation'. It will not matter that the word 'privatisation' did not even appear in the Conservative manifesto of 1979, or that both privatisation itself, and the eventual successful assault on union power, came about less as a well-thought- out strategy, more as a panic reaction to events, when her economic policies brought the country to near disaster in the early Eighties. No, Thatcher has been accorded the dubious honour of being sanctified by New Labour, who went back on their promise to put the railways back into public control, and even want to privatise air traffic control. </p> <p>Even Thatcher stopped short of privatising the railways. The deed was done under John Major, who says in his memoirs that 'hundreds of millions of pounds more could have been raised in the market for improving our railways if Tony Blair and Clare Short had not raised the foolish, but in 1996 all too credible, spectre of renationalisation'. </p> <p>The giveaway there is the 'hundreds of millions'. Billions more would have been needed - and still are. And the truth is that although rail privatisation has been a farce - a a farce with dire effects - the privatisers are by no means the only culprits. For years successive governments have underinvested in the railways, and in the nation's physical and social infrastructure generally. Whenever Labour or Conservative governments were faced with budgetary problems in the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties and Nineties, the easiest thing to cut or delay was capital expenditure - what economists term 'investment', as opposed to the more common use of 'investment' as purchase of stocks and shares. </p> <p>The charge against Thatcher is that it was not just budgetary pressure that motivated her: it was sheer prejudice against the public sector in general, and the railways in particular. What had become an unfortunate national reaction to crisis - starving the infrastructure of investment - became formal policy. Prejudice against the public sector was institutionalised. We are now paying the price: the storms and floods made things exceptionally bad last week. But the fact is that it is now an everyday occurrence to experience severe delays on roads, railways and tubes. </p> <p>Incidentally, in the strange way in which policy develops out of the anecdotal experiences of politicians, I have heard that Thatcher absolutely hated railways after being delayed by a snowdrift in the late Seventies. In her reaction to that lay the delays experienced by millions of others. She, of course, simply refused to travel by rail. </p> <p>Now, in common with economist Sir James Ball, and the great Runciman himself, I am suspicious of the OBE school of history (One Big Explanation). It was not just Thatcherism that brought us so much public squalor amid private affluence. But it certainly made one hell of a contribution. And, as more and more people are realising, New Labour, who were elected to do something about all this, have effectively wasted their first term. Visitors to Britain wonder what on earth has been going on. I find more and more of them making un-favourable comparisons with Third World countries. </p> <p>The continued erosion of public services (and rail should be considered one) is the obverse side of the Government's undoubted success in bringing public sector finances under control. It is one of the reasons why people are so angry with this Government. Of course, Blair and Brown now have plans for massive increases in public investment; but they have left it perilously late. </p> <p>One of the constraints has been Labour's acceptance of the Thatcher/Lawson settlement on direct taxation. True, they have made up some ground via stealth taxes; but now these have been rumbled. It is therefore most timely that a new Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development study finds no clear link between low taxation and economic prosperity. </p> <p>We already knew that from observation of Scandinavia and other civilised European countries; but it is nice to have it in writing. </p> <p>If we want to emerge from public sector squalor, we have to pay for the privilege, as the Continentals do. </p> <p>Oh, by the way, did you hear the story about one of our leading Conservative taxcutters saying 'the trouble with Brussels is they want to turn us into a modern European nation'? It's true, but I am sworn to secrecy on the circumstances in which the remark was made.</p>",
  "<p>Sara Lee, the giant US cakes-to-Wonderbra conglomerate, will bid for Bernard Matthews, the Norfolk turkey producer, on Wednesday night. Well-placed sources close to Sara Lee confirmed it will bid 205p per share, valuing Bernard Matthews at \u00a3257 million. </p> <p>Analysts say the offer will not be enough to convince Matthews, who controls 42 per cent of total share capital, to relinquish control of the company he started 50 years ago. </p> <p>The 70-year-old Norfolk farmer, a household name thanks to his 'Bootiful' catchphrase, has already offered shareholders 185p a share in a bid to take his company private. </p> <p>He will have 14 days from Wednesday to match Sara Lee's offer or lose the support of Royal &amp; Sun Alliance's 4.5 per cent shareholding. </p> <p>Sources close to Bernard Matthews indicated that he was prepared to match Sara Lee's 205p a share offer. </p> <p>To persuade Matthews to sell, analysts believe Sara Lee will have to offer in excess of 230p per share, valuing the frozen turkey and processed meat company at \u00a3288m. This would yield Matthews and his family more than \u00a3120m. </p> <p>It is thought that Sara Lee may be prepared to bid higher. It finally bought British textile company Courtaulds last June for \u00a3149m, having originally bid \u00a3100m. </p> <p>Sara Lee, which also owns Pretty Polly tights, Douwe Egberts coffee and Radox, wants Matthews to bolster its processed meat division, one of the biggest in the world. </p> <p>The whole group's worldwide sales in just three months to September was \u00a33 billion. Bernard Matthews' turnover in 1999 was \u00a3344m. </p> <p>Bernard Matthews has thrived in the midst of the recent UK farming crisis.

Everything is stylised, from the droop of her neck to the arch of her instep. Her Giselle is never torn between womanhood and witchery, for she is all spirit. Her remoteness is uninvolving, for there is no chink through which her personality can be revealed. Any call for spontaneity unsettles this company. Attempts at jollification in Don Quixote reduce them to amateurishness. The Korean/Russian fusion, which works so well in moonlit scenes, comes unstuck in Spanish sunlight. </p> <p>Beautifully trained, the dancers shine in purely classical ballet: Western conventions of bravura display and character acting appear alien to them. </p> <p>Antony Tudor's <strong> Shadowplay</strong>, back in the Royal Ballet's repertoire after 16 years' absence, is a Buddhist ballet, charting the progress of a young man towards enlightenment. Because Tudor uses Charles Koechlin's music, inspired by Kipling's Jungle Book stories, the Boy with Matted Hair is assumed to be Mowgli. But in Carlos Acosta's interpretation, he could equally well be Siddhartha, the young prince who became the Buddha. </p> <p>Afro-Cuban Acosta is a natural nobleman, innocently arrogant. His elegance is mocked by the monkey Arboreals; he loses his self-possession, first to the sinister, sensual Terrestrial (Nigel Burley), then to the killer seductress Celestial (Tamara Rojo). He is forced to find out about sex and corruption before he can return to his tree-roots and aspire to Nirvana. The creatures who disrupt his journey are dressed as Orientals, part human-animal, part shadow-puppet. Rojo's Celestial is as demonic as her Black Swan in Swan Lake . Burley's Terrestrial is rather too easily subdued. </p> <p> Shadowplay , tantalising and occasionally tedious, is redeemed by its ending. Koechlin's music casts a mesmerising spell. The Boy composes himself for meditation. He ignores the monkeys, until he, too, scratches his armpit. He may be on the road to enlightenment but he has a way to go. </p> <p><strong> Stephen Petronio</strong>, in his Strange Attractors for Dance Umbrella, opens with a clump of dancers clutching each other with Petronio lonely in their midst. Their line-up reappears in the second half of the work, dispersing into combative bouts of dancing. In between moments of languor, the dance-athletes bob, weave and kick-box to James Lavelle's trance-music score. Suspended above them, Anish Kapoor's gleaming black discs are eyes into another world. </p> <p>In the first half, Michael Nyman's pensive score is offset by fervent dance. These days, Petronio's adepts find serenity through action. No longer frantic, they have secure centres from which they can go off-kilter: chaos can be contained.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Stressed Out</strong> C4 <br><strong>Black Bear Rescue </strong>BBC1 <br><strong>Little Bird </strong>ITV <br><strong>Equinox: The Science of Stress </strong>C4 <br><strong>Fat Friends </strong>ITV <br><strong>Ruby </strong>BBC2 <br><strong>Josie's Journey </strong>BBC1 <br><strong>The Weakest Link: Champions League </strong> BBC1 </p> <p>Obviously, schedules can't be expected to take into account fearsome acts of God, but in a stressful week there seemed to be a great deal of extra stress-inducing TV. On Sunday night, for example, as the nation tied Toto to a door handle and dug out that pair of ruby slippers last worn in autumn 1987, Channel 4 devoted an hour-and-a-half to the horrors of working at Leeds City Council's One Stop Shop, where 14 per cent of the workforce were diagnosed as suffering from something close to clinical depression.</p> <p>Like a latter-day Kingdom of Oz, the modern front office was awash with chirpy mission statements while the backroom resembled a set from Terry Gilliam's Brazil: wonky filing-cabinets in battleship grey and lighting that allowed even the perkiest of personnel to assume the pallor of the recently deceased. But, happily, after administering a Poppins-ish dose of flip-charts, questionnaires and sugar-coated homilies, a pair of stress-management gurus managed to drag most of the workforce back from the metaphorical window ledge.</p> <p>Even though, leaves on the line and gridlocked motorways notwithstanding, watching <strong>Stressed Out </strong>probably ensured high levels of miserablist absenteeism the following morning.</p> <p>No, on a Sunday night we don't want too much Cortisol pumping around our systems, so it was probably less disturbing to switch to BBC1's <strong>Black Bear Rescue</strong>, where Amanda Burton was to be found playing with orphaned black bear cubs in Idaho. A celebrity getting up close and personal with telegenic beasties is, I suspect, the dumbed-down future of wildlife documentaries, if only because the old-fashioned, hardcore teeth-and-claws stuff is becoming far too depressing.</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday, for example, in BBC2's Wild strand, we had seen hungry, tranquillised polar bears being airlifted away from their globally warmed (and therefore swiftly melting) Canadian ice-floes, followed by Rajasthani tigers dodging poachers keen to sell their aphrodisiacal penises to the Japanese. But why Amanda? Other than, perhaps, to reveal that, contrary to the evidence of every single episode of Silent Witness, she is entirely capable of smiling, preferably while stroking a big (tranquillised) bear and describing it as smelling 'piney, cosy, just like you'd expect a bear to be, really'.</p> <p>Still, Burton's ability to grin like a great big girly failed to be exploited any further in Wednesday's <strong>Little Bird</strong>, in which she was back to her old routine. If there were any Baftas for sitting pensively inside a car in the rain, Burton could expect to be nominated several times over (she even snuck a quick one into Black Bear Rescue), but in Little Bird - a turgid, ponderous, strangely unemotional drama about adoption, in which she played a social worker - Burton gave us quite a few variations on the themes of pensive, ever-so-slightly-angry and possibly-a-little-bit-sad, plus one or two completely-inscrutables, all in profile, in a car, in the rain.</p> <p>Admittedly, it wasn't Amanda's fault that this one-off ITV drama had followed hard on the heels of BBC1's riveting adoption documentary series, Love Is Not Enough, but it was unfortunate that her character, Rachel, parroted the line again. Perhaps 'Love is not enough...' is the mission statement Blu-Tacked to the walls of adoption agencies?</p> <p>In Monday's <strong>Equinox: The Science of Stress</strong>, the second of C4's 'Stop, Go Home' series, we learned that Cortisol was a very useful hormone in the days when we needed to escape from lions, but somewhat less so if you're stuck in front of a call centre's crashing computer screen. Today we live in 'a stress culture' in which 'technology is pushing us forward faster than we can adapt', which will have come as a surprise to, well, almost nobody. The only thing to do, apparently, is to 'craft a lifestyle to optimise our happiness'.</p> <p>Using actors playing a high-powered lawyer and his wife, a working mother, tips for 'optimising happiness' included chucking your mobile phone into the nearest swollen river, not accessing e-mails on planes, ignoring your boss's wholly unreasonable request to turn up for a meeting when you've just got off a long-haul flight on your wedding anniversary, and enjoying your downtime by reading a John Grisham, rather than Brad Thrust Jr's Ten Steps to Managerial Mightiness.</p> <p>Presumably, for those of us whose lives do not closely resemble a 1980s advertisement for British Airways Club Class, some homespun mission statements Blu-Tacked to the workstation may suffice: 'Work Is Not Enough', perhaps, or 'Pass The Prozac'.</p> <p>Incidentally, the latter got a brand name-check in last week's otherwise excellent <strong>Fat Friends</strong>, when one character offered another 'a Prozac, if it'll help...' Please don't try this at home, children: treating stress with 'a Prozac' would be only slightly less helpful than a shot of Paracetamol or a weekend seminar by Brad Thrust.</p> <p>Reassuring, though, to know that the show's writer, Kay Mellor, hasn't succumbed to medicated depression, which is more than can be said for most of Ruby Wax's Tuesday night dinner guests on <strong>Ruby</strong> - Roseanne, Lynda La Plante and David Baddiel, who dished up delicious dinner-party topics such as the pros and cons of anal sex and the fact that being bonkersly successful and having loads of money just doesn't make you very happy at all, really. Given the high whinge-quotient, this was still hugely entertaining, but perhaps a spoonful of medicine would help all that unpalatable sugary celebrity go down - a day optimising some latent happiness by working at Leeds City Council's One Stop Shop, for example. </p> <p>But even if you spent most of last week in a dinghy, rowing down the high street (and, incidentally, what was Steve Redgrave doing when the emergency services needed him? Announcing his retirement, that's what), moaning was not an option between the hours of 10.30 and 11.30 on Wednesday night, during <strong>Josie's Journey</strong>, in which the survivor of the brutal attack that killed her mother, Lin, and sister, Megan, revealed herself to be a refreshingly unsaintly, engagingly stroppy 13-year-old with a smile even bigger than Amanda Burton's. </p> <p>At times this was an unbearably poignant documentary, notably when Josie's father Shaun broke down at Lin and Megan's simple grave, but at others it left a slightly bitter taste. Despite a mutually beneficial 'relationship' with both the Sun and the Daily Mail (they get the Josie exclusives, the Russells get cash for her trust fund) and the savvy acknowledgement that 'a drip-drip-drip of little stories is enough to keep the media at bay...', it was also made clear by Shaun that '[Josie] is at the point of wanting to move away from further media offers' (she swiftly rejected an invitation to open a f\u00eate with a straightforward, non-negotiable and Kevin The Teenager-ish 'boring!').</p> <p> At the end of the programme, however, there was a plug for the accompanying BBC book, written by Shaun, and so one gets the feeling that, like the parents of Sarah Payne, Josie's father uses a sympathetic media, when it suits, as a balm for his indescribable loss. Josie herself had the last word, dismissing her bravery with a shrug and suggesting that, in the future, 'I'll just ask the press people to go away and leave me alone.' Nice try, Josie - but they will never leave you alone.</p> <p>Wrong channel, right time: on Thursday night, while solicitor-turned-postwoman Kate Heusser was becoming only the second contestant - and the first woman - to win \u00a3500,000 on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, I was over on BBC1, gripped while watching mild-mannered Margaret rack up a massive \u00a37,600 in last week's second edition of <strong>The Weakest Link: Champion's League</strong>. 'I've never seen a cheque like that in my life, ever...' she said, blinking like one of Wonderland's dormice. And while she could easily have gone the distance on WWTBAM , I'm not sure she would have looked any more delighted with the result. </p> <p>Incidentally, I was 'Whassuped?' three times last week (by middle-class, middle-youth, white English people. And the next one who tries it will, indeed, find out 'whassup'), but received only one 'You are the weakest link. Goodbye!' - though I fear it's still early days.</p>",
  "<p>In the summer of 1998, in the wake of the Columbine High School massacre, the NME ran a cover story in defence of goth rocker Marilyn Manson, who had been cited as the evil influence which turned a pair of teenage boys into the slayers of their fellow students. 'Not Guilty' declared the headline. Boy were they ever wrong. </p> <p>Manson may not have been responsible for the Columbine slayings, but he's guilty all right. Not just of making dreary music and wearing too much eye-liner, but of creepier excesses: raiding graveyards for human remains, a fascination for prosthetic limbs, and a recent declaration in favour of George W. Bush. Anyone interested in the sordid details should check out his autobiography, The Long Road Out of Hell. </p> <p>There they can also read a little, but not too much, about Manson's fascination with Satanism, whose agenda underpins almost everything that the 31-year-old musician has created. America's self-styled Moral Majority have long maintained as much, denouncing Manson as an agent of Lucifer, out to poison the minds and souls of American youth. </p> <p>For once, the hardcore Christians have a point, albeit one very easily lost amid their hysterical conspiracy theories. For according to the fundamentalists, the whole of rock music is a satanic plot of which even the cuddly old Beatles are a part. This is the same crew who have successfully campaigned to have the Harry Potter books banned in several American states on account of their sinister occultism - just look at the S (for Satan) formed by the scar on Harry's forehead ! </p> <p>But Brian Warner - to use Manson's more mundane given name - really does preach a kind of Satanism, which oozes unpleasantly from the pus-filled imagery of his songs and artworks (scabs, ulcers, tumours and bodily disease are a constant in MM songs). His constant lampooning of Christianity and obsession with the crucifixion are one thing, and can be explained as an attack on the moral hypocrisy of the church and as a reaction against his own fundamentalist schooling (arch Satanist Aleister Crowley, likewise, was raised a Plymouth Brethren). </p> <p>But beyond that come the trappings of pentagrams, planetary glyphys, and tarot trumps featuring Manson in the darkest aspect of The Hanged Man, The Magician, The Emperor and The Devil. There are sub-Nietzschean lyrics like 'the weak are there to justify the strong' (an idea lifted almost intact from Mein Kampf) . </p> <p>Promoting his new album, Holy Wood (out next week), Manson even said: 'The two years since my last album have been filled with God and rappers. It's time for Death and Satan to be put in the forefront'. </p> <p>Most commentators see all this merely as a combination of shock tactics and shrewd business sense, which they certainly are. But there is also an underlying philosophy of hatred, destruction, and power which is drawn from the darker side of esoteric thought, and in which there is a notable absence of compassion. </p> <p>Rock music has, of course, been here before, most notably around the time that Charles Manson was becoming famous for his particular cocktail of psychedelic drugs, pop songs and mass murder. Marilyn Manson (who chose his name as a tribute to this monster) is the most dedicated of rock's modern neo- Satanists. 'Darkness and light, good and evil go hand in hand, you can't separate them,' he says. Well, yes Brian, but most of us grow up being scared of the dark; you are scared of the light. Now take your skeleton chandeliers and shove off.</p>",
  "<p>Our story begins in Buffalo, in New York State's declining 'rust belt'. Six former steel mill workers, out of shape and out of work, decide to take their lives in hand. They may not have jobs, but they are, after all, still men. And women will always need men. Shouldn't they be making the most of their remaining visible assets? </p> <p>Does the premise sound familiar? Replace the shores of Lake Erie with the foothills of the Pennines, the defunct steel mills of Buffalo with the defunct steel mills of Sheffield, and we have The Full Monty . </p> <p>In Britain we have known for a while how strongly Americans felt about the original film - it took $45 million at the box office. But we didn't realise quite how possessive they had become. </p> <p>Now, just a week after the opening of The Full Monty: the musical, the gritty northern fable is halfway to being appropriated as part of the American Dream. It is already the hottest- selling ticket on Broadway and one day it may even earn the rare accolade of breaking even. The critics have been positive. Ben Brantley in the New York Times called it 'that rare aggressive crowd-pleaser that you don't have to apologise for liking'. To the Daily News it was 'fresh, bouncy and downright delightful'. </p> <p>'There was an awful long line waiting for seats today,' said a proud member of the production team on Friday. </p> <p>But there is one key person in The Full Monty saga who has not been queuing for a ticket: the British screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy. Only a few of Beaufoy's original lines remain in the musical and he no longer regards it as his story. </p> <p>'He feels it is nothing to do with him now and he has no plans to go to see it,' Beaufoy's agent, Rod Hall, told The Observer last week. Beaufoy was not even invited to the first night. </p> <p>The book for the new musical has been almost entirely rewritten by Terrence McNally, the playwright recently embroiled in religious controversy after his play Corpus Christi, about a gay Christ figure, was staged in New York and London. McNally, who also wrote the book for Kiss of the Spiderwoman , has had no contact with Beaufoy and has only seen the film once. </p> <p>So how did America manage to hi-jack this British hit? On the strength of the film, two influential showbusiness executives gave up their day jobs in order to bring a musical treatment of the story to the stage. One of them was Lindsay Law, former president of 20th Century Fox's Searchlight division, the company who released the original Monty. </p> <p>'It was a one-time-only adventure,' he says. 'Although the film was set in Sheffield, it was obvious it translated everywhere. It is the same heart and for that reason it could travel.' </p> <p>At Fox, Law was in charge of around 80 film scripts at any moment. He was keen to focus on one project only and he chose The Full Monty. </p> <p>Now a co-producer of the musical along with Thomas Hall, the former director of San Diego's Old Globe Theater, Law is to visit London this week to 'explore the possibility' of bringing the show to Britain. A tour of America has just been agreed, he says, and there are also plans to take it to Hamburg, Madrid, Mexico City and Sydney. But London, he knows, will be the real problem. </p> <p>'We have an American musical here and it would not be at all easy to change it to a British musical, although we have utilised a British movie. Our biggest concern is Great Britain by virtue of the special affection in its heart for this story.' </p> <p>Despite the fact that the producers have had no contact with the original Monty creative team, they have taken out an advertisement in the show's programme which formally thanks both Beaufoy and Umberto Pasolini, the producer of the film. </p> <p>'Reviews have said how closely it sticks to the movie,' says Law. 'We do have a couple of new women characters - a jazzy accompanist and a female stripper - but the guys are true to the original guys.' </p> <p>Law denies that he has simply Americanised the story to make it commercially acceptable in the States. 'Musical comedy is one of the few art forms that is original to America. We invented it and there are many more practitioners here, so it made sense for me to develop it out here. Then, of course, the team were going to be much more comfortable doing it with an American story rather than wondering all the time what those guys in Sheffield would have said. </p> <p>'Even over here there are plenty who fail constantly by writing boring musicals. A lot of the stuff on Broadway is full of mugging and \"large\" acting. The Full Monty is true to life and as a result has a much more substantial book.' </p> <p>It is a specific writing skill, Law argues, to be able to establish a character in a couple of lines and then lead him into a song. 'Terrence wrote the complete book to the show and then it was obvious some scenes were going to be better as songs.' </p> <p>The show has nearly double the budget of the film, which has made around \u00a3170 million worldwide. But the talent hired to work on the musical did not look, on paper, like a team that would guarantee a hit. Take McNally. More than 2,000 catholics, Hindus and Muslims demonstrated on the streets when his play Corpus Christi came to Manhattan. He did not seem the natural choice to write for a fun, family night out. </p> <p>The composer, David Yazbek, had previously written only for an obscure rock band, and Jack O'Brien, the director, has a chequered track record. His previous show, More to Love, closed after four days in 1998. Even the show's star, Patrick Wilson, arrived fresh from two critical disasters, Fascinating Rhythm and Bright Lights, Big City. </p> <p>The show was initially 'workshopped' quietly with 12 actors and then staged in full in San Diego. For Law, this slow creative process was crucial. 'It was a question of listening to your show to see what you had,' he says. </p> <p>What they had was a show with songs that rhymed 'carving' with 'Lee Marvin' and 'cojones' with 'testosterones'. Our heroes are a divorced father called Jerry and his chunky pal, Dave, who collaborate with four friends in a last-ditch search for cash and self-esteem. The famous dole-queue bopping scene is gone, so too is the moment when the troupe learn to dance by aping the Arsenal defence appeal for offside. Instead the gay love element in the plot has been enhanced and basketball replaces football. As in the film, the story builds to the climatic question, will they ever strip bare? And it is a question that has the audience in a nightly frenzy. 'They scream and yell, and not just at the stripping,' says Law, 'but at the humour. I was nervous about the Wednesday matinee because they were older women, but they were just as raucous.' </p> <p>Some of the mass delirium induced by the show's finale is, it should be pointed out, rather whooped up by the fact that female members of the cast join the audience in the stalls. It is a revelatory theatrical moment, though, and one which underlines exactly why it was decided it might be rather ambiguous to translate the British phrase 'the full monty' into its American equivalent, 'the whole nine yards'. </p> <p>\u0095 'The Full Monty': Eugene O' Neill Theatre, New York (00 1 212 239 6200), booking to 14 Jan.</p>",
  "<p>When she was a child, she says, she was rather plain; not beautiful at all - a plump and pigtailed swot whose father would sit by her side in the evenings while she did her homework, and who immersed herself in Victorian novels, romantic poetry and the great Hollywood films of the Forties. A conscientious eldest child growing up in Stockport during the war and ration years, passing the 11-plus, going to grammar school, getting good grades, and dreaming of Betty Grable, Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner with their silk gowns and lipsticked, dangerous allure. Dreaming of leaving. Of being someone else, somewhere different.</p> <p>She knew there was a place called university, though no one in her family had ever been there. She knew that this was her route away from her roots. A gulf was growing between her and her parents, who had themselves struggled so hard to leave their working class backgrounds for the lower middle classes. Her aspiration was also a kind of rejection. Success was a kind of betrayal. </p> <p>Joan Bakewell is now in her mid-sixties, and emotionally in a 'bit of a beached' place since her 25-year marriage to her second husband Jack Emery ended a few months ago. 'It's hard at 66,' she says with a wry grimace and no self-pity. </p> <p>She has an eloquent, graceful face, with her large eyes, her dark, gleaming hair, her fine, determined features. She has a firm chin that she keeps - literally and metaphorically - up. There is a luminous quality about her that is immensely attractive, and a kind of pluck. She sits on a sofa in her beautiful house in Primrose Hill - large rooms, tall windows through which sunlight slants, and outside a square of golden trees, scattering their leaves on the grass - immaculate in her black suit and black T-shirt.</p> <p>She still would not call herself beautiful, however often the epithet has been given to her. Nor, she insists, has she ever thought herself so ('I simply do the best I can'). But for many years - over three decades - her public has known her as a woman who combines loveliness and good sense, who can be rather earnest, very sexy and studiously clever all at once. </p> <p>She started her media career proper with the arts programme Late Night Line Up in the Sixties, and began a second career when for many years she presented The Heart of the Matter, the Sunday evening religious programme that debated ethical dilemmas. She resigned from that last year but still has several television projects on the boil - as well as being on Radio 3's Brains Trust, involved with the BBC's new digital cultural channel, on the board of the Tate (she was one of the jurors responsible for choosing the architect for the Tate Modern) and chair of the British Film Institute, whose London Film Festival opened last Wednesday. From going to the cinema twice a week as a movie-mad girl, now she's representing movies. </p> <p>It's a long journey from post-war Joan Dawson Rowlands to postmodern Joan Bakewell, CBE, whose high cheekbones and long legs we know; whose seven-year affair with Harold Pinter, the subject of his play Betrayal, is now famous, whose crisp diction (learnt from elocution lessons that her mother insisted on) is still familiar. 'But I'm not a star,' she says. 'I never have been. I have a pretty average media life. I have never been on a ladder. It's not a career. I just work. I'm a worker.' </p> <p>And she is, resilient and diligent, slogging on when so many around her disappear; a trouper. </p> <p>Joan Bakewell speaks of her parents as being 'touchingly ordinary', yet the life of her mother is a painful narrative and clearly still casts shadows over the daughter who got away. Her mother, Rose, was the eldest of a large family, intelligent and ambitious (she wanted to be an engineer), who left school at 13 to look after her seven siblings. When she married Joan's father, whose own mother worked as a seamstress to within four hours of dying, the 'great honour of being lower middle class, no longer working class, was that the woman could stay at home - in a house where there was an indoor toilet and some kitchen facilities. My mother's job was to keep the home impeccable. She was very clever, but that was what she was taught to aspire to. It was a nightmare to live with. You could hardly dare put anything down. Everything had to be flawless; every last speck of dust had to be chased from the house. </p> <p>'All her energies went into that. She was unhappy, and that snarled up our relationship. I remember her as silent - great stretches of silence. And she would hit me and my sister, smack us, a slap here, a flick of the wrist, a sharp tap. She was always terrified we would get pregnant before we got married. She made me secretive. I hid things from her. I took care not to get caught. I went to church. I was baptised and confirmed, I went to youth clubs, all sorts of jolly fresh air activities and maybe a bit of groping behind the youth club, holding hands, a peck on the cheek, and thinking, \"more, more\", but knowing because of what my mother said it was dangerous to want more.' </p> <p>Cambridge (where she studied history) took her away from her parents, and introduced her to books, sex, pleasure, privileged young men and women with alien accents and love of learning. Her horizons opened. 'There was a whole world out there.' But she was still tied to her background ('I was rather Edwardian really') and she married her boyfriend, Michael Bakewell, because that was what you did, and started a family, because that was what you did, too. And gave up work as an advertising copywriter and occasional journalist (because ditto). </p> <p>This was the Fifties: the great change of the Sixties was waiting in the wings, but in her twenties Joan Bakewell had both managed to escape and yet remained trapped by her gender and her sense of what was appropriate. 'I'm very conventional really, you know,' she says. 'It's a big thing for me, breaking the rules.' </p> <p>Feminism and the Sixties changed her world and broke the rules for her, although she says that sometimes she regrets that it did not happen until she was in her thirties. 'I've been catching up ever since.' </p> <p>Her life flowered with new pain and possibility. Her career took off, though it did not happen overnight. In 1964, when she was 30, she started work with Late Night Line Up on BBC2 (a Late Review of its day). Later she became the presenter of The Heart of the Matter and, consequently, a kind of national pin-up. She also started her seven-year affair with Pinter, a friend and colleague of her husband, (although in the middle of it she and Bakewell had another child, a son). The affair - which was an open secret in the world in which she moved - was only made public with Michael Billington's biography of Pinter. The playwright gave permission to Joan Bakewell to talk. (' \"Really talk?\" I said.'). </p> <p>She had been strictly brought up to believe that private lives should be kept private, and yet talk she did, speaking candidly of the passion and joy of those years, as well as the pain. She did not, she said then and repeats today, regret it. She chose to tell the story, she says to me now, because it was in an 'intelligent book'; it was long ago, everyone she cared about knew of the affair. It was time (though she drank a glass of wine beforehand to steady her nerve). The subsequent brouhaha took her by surprise. </p> <p>She was 28 when her mother died, of leukaemia, a few years before her turbulent decade. The death brought Joan Bakewell a wrenching grief because everything between them remained so unresolved. 'It was not until I was in my mid-thirties, with the arrival of feminism, that I saw how clever she was, how thwarted, how terribly unhappy. We - my sister Susan and myself - found certificates in the drawers. All those classes she'd been to, learning about Beethoven, Picasso... always wanting to better herself. Seeing what I was doing with my life must have made her very wistful, I saw that at last. And then I could forgive her, when she was dead and it was too late.' </p> <p>Her beloved father's death in 1992 gave her a softer grief, a grief she was almost glad of ('a deep and good grief'). He was in his eighties, and died in her arms. A few years later her younger sister died of breast cancer. 'When she told me about the cancer, I cried out, \"You can't leave me.\" When she went it was part of my life that went - a visceral separation.' </p> <p>She's not scared of death herself, but she's scared of losing other people. There has been other loss in her life. She and her first husband separated, after their 'mutual infidelities'. Now she and her second husband have also separated. 'Here I am, in my sixties, and I thought everything would go on the same, but it's become this strange period of change.' Everything is different. For almost the first time in her life, she is on her own, in a large house, her children gone, having to make sure she organises her time and fills her suddenly yawning weekends. Women friends, she says, have been 'completely wonderful' - a 'warm blanket' of love and support, 'a springboard so that I can go on'. </p> <p>She sees her two children and their families often. She is a grandmother of six. When she talks of her grandchildren her face lights up. She is reading the celebrated children's author Philip Pullman at the moment so that she can keep in touch with their emergent worlds. </p> <p>But sometimes she looks in the mirror and thinks 'oh my God, I'd forgotten about that. The neck goes. Around the eyes. No more skimpy frocks. No more of that utter freedom of being young. Fashion leaves you behind - I've always been interested in clothes but clothes are losing their interest in me. Except sexy shoes. </p> <p>'But I don't feel post-sexual, although at this moment I am incapacitated a bit. I don't see myself as living in a neutered reality. I don't think that women ever need to feel like that - maybe they often feel like that because that's how other people see them. </p> <p>'I went to the Maudsley Hospital the other day,' she goes on. 'I was interviewing a doctor who treats children, and on her shelves there were all these generic dolls, you know - the boy with genitals, the little girl doll, the woman, the man. And there was this doll with crinkly grey hair and little spectacles on the end of her nose and wearing slippers with bobbles on. \"What's that?\" I asked, and she said, \"That's granny.\" \"But I'm a granny,\" I said, \"Look at me, this is what grannies look like.

We've had feminist women writing and talking about being young, working, trying to bring up children, marrying, divorcing, going through the menopause. And now at last we've got to feminism that's talking about the reality of getting old. This is what it's like. Of course, friends do begin to die and we are approaching death ourselves, but we're not all Yeatsian - when you are old and grey and nodding by the fire and that kind of thing. </p> <p>'No. I was fearful of death in my twenties and my thirties.

  "I am in the process of divorcing my husband of five years. We have a two-year-old daughter. When we first separated, he came to see her regularly but his visits have now become less frequent because, he says, he cannot bear seeing me. <p>So far, I have done nothing to encourage him because, although my rational self is keen for him to stay in contact with us so that he and our daughter can build a relationship, there's a part of me that would not be sorry to see him fade away. </p> <p>He has an alcohol problem which has worsened over the years, and I worry what kind of a role model he will be and whether our daughter will be able to cope with his problems. </p> <p>Should I encourage him to see her regularly or let him quietly drift away? <br> <b> A.M. of Lincoln </b></p> <p> Pay no heed to sexual political correctness. It is characteristic of a mother to show more forward planning for her daughter's welfare than the father does, especially where a couple has split up. It is also characteristic that he should blame you for his own pattern of defaulting and that you should meekly accept the accusation. </p> <p>Yes, it is right and proper that your daughter should grow up knowing and associating with her own father. You don't need to be told this, though I daresay he does. Her needs and rights are paramount; his are of much less consequence. </p> <p>It is possible, even probable, that you will marry again and give her a new father-figure to whom she will relate comfortably. But whatever happens, there will come a time, probably in her teenage years, when she will show curiosity about her origins and, if contact has been lost, will move heaven and earth to find out about her dad. Far better that they should keep in touch so that there are no shock revelations at a future date. </p> <p>You can't force him to visit his child, probably you can't influence his response to duty at all, but you can pave the way, make it easier for him to fulfil his obligations. Use your feminine tact and find a solution. For instance, could your mother stand in when he visits so you don't have to meet? You would soon find out how genuine his intentions are. </p> <p>His alcohol problem would not worry me overmuch in regard to his potential as a role model. With plenty of good examples and guidance, she will form her own judgments, sooner than you think. </p> <p>Regrettably, when two people have created a child, they are bound together by indissoluble links, and you will never be able to obliterate him altogether. As you are currently in the throes of divorce, your level of mutual bitterness will be at its highest. In the course of time, the antipathy will moderate and problems which now seem insuperable will become manageable. </p> <p><b>Reader's response </b></p> <p>I have a two-year-old son by my ex-husband. We separated after a similar length of time to you and I, too, have concerns as to whether he is a suitable person to act as a role model for my little boy. </p> <p>You will find that a lot of well-meaning people will try to lecture you on the importance of ensuring that your daughter keeps in touch with both parents. This is absolutely true where there is a genuine commitment from both parents to maintaining the contact. </p> <p>But where one parent is unreliable, feckless or only insisting on access in order to enact some kind of revenge or control over their former partner, then what good is served by seeking to maintain contact out of some misplaced feeling of social duty? </p> <p>If your ex-partner was truly committed to seeing your daughter, he would not be put off seeing her by having to see you every time he arrives for an access visit. You have to think of your daughter's happiness and, as the stable parent in her life, you have a duty to protect her from unnecessary pain. <br> <b> L.R. of London </b></p> <p><b>Next week's problem</b></p> <p> My partner and I have a three-year-old daughter and although I am happy with one child, my partner is very keen for us to have another baby.

  "<p>My Scottish Widows policy was assigned to me in 1993 when I divorced, but the company continued to put my ex-husband's name on communications sent to my address. A year ago, the company said I was the qualifying member for the merger payout, and I opted for loan notes as I recently sold a holiday cottage and had used my capital gains tax allowance for this year. </p> <p>Again, the form was addressed to my ex-husband, but Scottish Widows told me that changing his name for mine was satisfactory. </p> <p>My loan notes failed to arrive because, it was said, my form was one of 4 per cent randomly selected for checking. I was later told that compensation was suppressed because there was a query over who was the qualifying member, and that I would now be paid in cash. </p> <p>Because of the delay, I will have to pay \u00a33,600 in capital gains tax, although Scottish Widows knew from the outset that I was a qualifying member and required a loan note.<strong><br> DD, Ilkley</strong></p> <p>The company agrees that it gave you inconsistent and conflicting information, and wrongly addressed the forms to your former husband. There was no random sampling. </p> <p>A number of policyholders have been stuck with cash after requesting loan notes, but it looks as though you might be able to receive loan notes after all. </p> <p>Scottish Widows revealed that it has had discussions with the Inland Revenue, which will now allow more loan notes to be issued in certain circumstances, in particular where the company has made a mistake. </p> <p>The insurer will be in touch with you when it has more information. </p> <p><strong> Hope of cover is a write-off</strong></p> <p>On 29 February our neighbour's wall fell on our car when it was parked in the street. Through our insurance company, Royal &amp; SunAlliance, the car was repaired but I still had to pay the first \u00a3100 of the bill. </p> <p>Last June, R&amp;SA said there was no reasonable prospect of pursuing the claim successfully and, after giving me 14 days to comment, it planned to close the file. I responded to its letter, but have heard nothing since the middle of September. </p> <p>Is it not a standard clause in house contents policies that the policyholder is indemnified against financial loss incurred by a third party? <strong><br>SP, Bath </strong></p> <p>The weakness in the third party liability clause is that, for a claim to be successful, you have to prove the other person was at fault. </p> <p>If your neighbour says she had no idea the that wall was weak, you have to prove that she did know and did nothing about it. </p> <p>But now, even though R&amp;SA has given up hope of making the other side pay up, it has agreed to give you \u00a3100 as an ex gratia payment. </p> <p><strong> Lawyer's error cost me a bonus</strong></p> <p>I redeemed my mortgage with the Skipton Building Society when I bought a new property this June. Due to an oversight by my solicitor, the Skipton did not receive payment until 3 July. It claimed this took my account into another month, for which I was liable to pay an extra month's interest of \u00a3200. </p> <p>Some weeks later, I discovered that the society was making loyalty payments, but was told that I had to have a mortgage with them on 19 July to qualify, and my mortgage was redeemed on 3 July. </p> <p>I did not qualify, even though I had to pay interest to the end of July.<strong><br>LH, Huddersfield </strong> </p> <p>With all payouts and bonuses, there is a cut-off date, which is bad luck for those who just miss out. </p> <p>You had already paid a \u00a345 discharge fee to the Skipton, but its rules say that you pay interest to the end of the month in which a mortgage is redeemed. If your solicitor was at fault for the late payment, you should trying talking to him about compensation for being forced to pay an extra month's interest. </p> <p>Skipton staff were deliberately kept in the dark about the loyalty bonus, as happens with all bonuses, until they arrived for work on 19 July, so no one could have forewarned you. </p> <p><strong> Insurer claws elderly cats</strong></p> <p>My two cats have been insured against vets' bills with DBI Insurance continuously since they were a few months old. They are now aged 11, and the renewal notice shows the premiums are rising by 52 per cent, there is a mandatory excess of \u00a340 and I then have to pay 35 per cent of any remaining bill. </p> <p>Previously, the company charged the same premium regardless of the animal's age and whether or not the owner lived in a low-cost area, as I do. </p> <p>I was prepared to pay over the odds for insuring my cats when they were young on the tacit understanding that cover would continue at a reasonable cost as my pets grew older. DBI's abrupt change of policy means that I am penalised.<strong><br>JT, Beaumaris </strong></p> <p>DBI (Dog Breeders Insurance) says premiums were bumped up by its new owner, Cornhill, because it had been trading unprofitably. This is no consolation to policyholders like you who were not expecting such a leap in cost. DBI says insuring a cat of 11 is \u00a37.55 a month. Primary Direct insures younger cats for \u00a35 a month, but you are trapped because no one will start insuring cats as old as yours. </p> <p><strong> Cancelled cheque: Did it check out?</strong></p> <p>I paid for shares in a new company with a \u00a32,000 building society cheque. The offer was cancelled, and the cheque returned. I thought, wrongly, that at least my money was safely back in my account. Just in time I stopped myself from tearing it up and, when I asked at the branch what would have happened, I was told: 'You would have lost \u00a32,000.'<strong><br>LS, Leicester </strong></p> <p>That is wrong. If you had destroyed the returned cheque, or it had been stolen, the money would have been returned to your account once the building society had proved your story. You cannot cancel third-party cheques but the building society can, if you report one lost or stolen. You lose interest between taking the cheque and paying it back in, so you should get it back into your account fast. </p> <p>\u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

  "Agriculture Minister Nick Brown yesterday ruled out a British ban on French beef imports despite mounting fears that BSE is widespread among France's cattle. <p>A Ministry official said: 'As law-abiding Europeans, we would not break the law by unilaterally imposing a ban. That is something for the European Commission and its scientific advisers to decide.' </p> <p>From tomorrow the majority of schools in Paris will have taken beef off the menu, and the French government is shortly expected to announce a halt to sales of beef-on-the bone following a threefold rise in the number of BSE cases in the past year. </p> <p>On Friday, France's biggest steak-house chain became the latest to withdraw T-bone steaks from the menu in its 220 restaurants. </p> <p>The row over safety standards in the French meat industry deepened last month when it was revealed that eight tonnes of meat from herds infected with BSE had ended up on supermarket shelves. The country's beef sales have gone into freefall, and farmers learnt yesterday that Russia and Hungary, which account for 14 per cent of their exports, had embargoed imports of French beef. </p> <p>This weekend the Tories called on Brussels to ban exports of French beef. Shadow agriculture spokesman James Paice said: 'If the the European Commission won't ban it, I think our Government should. That's exactly what the French have done to us in refusing to accept our beef. Europe lifted the ban and the French unilaterally decided not to.' </p> <p>Britain imports around 5,000 tonnes of French beef each year, although few firms in the supermarket or catering businesses would own up this weekend to using it, as they moved to reassure the public that most beef sold by them was British. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Marks &amp; Spencer said: 'None of our products sold in Britain are made from French beef, and although we do sell French beef in our Paris store we have imposed strict controls on the meat we use and are sure that it is safe.' </p> <p>However, neither she nor anybody from Tesco, Sainsbury or Whitbread - which owns hundreds of restaurants, including the Pizza Hut, Caf\u00e9 Rouge and Bella Pasta chains - could say categorically that French beef was not used in its products. </p> <p>A spokesman from Tesco said that most of the French beef was used in processed food such as burgers and pies. He also suggested that French beef could end up in British school meals. </p> <p>The Tories pointed out that the French still allow farmers to feed their cattle on meat and bone meal which has been banned in the UK for 10 years. There is also a concern that the French still let beef from cows more than 30 months old - the animals most at risk of contracting BSE - enter the human food chain. </p> <p>However, the UK Food Standards Agency defended the French beef industry. A spokesman said: 'Controls throughout Europe should, if correctly implemented and enforced, be removing all the high-risk material from beef before it enters the human food chain. </p> <p>'The reported incidence of BSE in cattle in the UK is still more than 150 times greater than in France, and there have been no substantiated cases of imported beef over 30 months old reaching consumers in the UK.' </p> <p>In 1999, the number of cases of BSE in British cattle was 472 per million compared with only 2.8 cases per million in France. </p> <p>However, while the number of diseased cattle in Britain continues to decline, the rate of infection in France is increasing. </p> <p>Recently two more cows infected with mad cow disease have been discovered in western France, bringing the number found in France to 86. There were fewer than 30 cases reported throughout the whole of last year. In Britain this year, there have so far been more than 1,000 cows infected with BSE. </p> <p>There has also been anecdotal evidence of French farmers concealing the extent of the disease in their herds by killing and burying sick cows rather than reporting them to the authorities. </p> <p>France's deepening BSE crisis has dealt a blow to a country that prides himself on taking more precautions than any other nation to make the meat safe to eat. </p> <p>Last month a French meat trader and his son spent a week in jail after being accused of knowingly selling a BSE-infected cow to an abattoir. They had tried to hide the sick animal in a batch of healthy ones. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.bse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bsereview.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Food Standards Agency BSE Review</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">MAFF BSE site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cjd\" target=\"_NEW\">Department of Health BSE/CJD site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.humanbse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Human BSE Foundation - voluntary support group</a><br> <a href=\"http://sparc.airtime.co.uk/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE news and research</a></p>",
  "'I hid my experience to protect myself. I had visions of being tied to a lamppost in O'Connell St, with my head shaved and a \"Murderer\" placard pinned to my chest.' <p>This is part of 'Amy's' story of returning home to Ireland after having had an abortion in another country. It is one of 18 stories in The Irish Journey which was launched yesterday at a conference in Dublin. It contains the personal accounts of Irish women who have been faced with a crisis pregnancy and decided to travel abroad, usually to Britain, for abortions. </p> <p>The first is by a woman who sought a back-street abortion in London in the early Sixties, and ended up in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, with a damaged uterus and severe septicaemia. She was severely lectured by the doctors. </p> <p>Since the 1967 Abortion Law Reform Act was passed in Britain, the situation has eased. Abortion is still illegal in Ireland, but thousands of women travel to clinics in Britain for terminations. The number is rising. Last year more than 6,000 women made this Irish journey, although the abortion rate in Britain went down. </p> <p>At yesterday's conference, writers, politicians, poets and trade unionists read the stories of some of these women to break the silence which has made abortion almost the last taboo in Irish society. </p> <p>The women involved do not feel able to give their names. One already had a severely handicapped child when she became pregnant again, and was fearful of the consequences for her family if she had a second baby with a handicap. Another was married to a husband who beat her and their children. </p> <p>One young woman was afraid that she might die while the procedure was being performed, and begged her boyfriend to invent a plausible story because she did not want her mother to know the true reason why she had gone to London. </p> <p>The women in The Irish Journey share a sense of loneliness and secrecy, as well as a deep anger that they were forced to conceal their experiences when they returned to Ireland. One mother said she had decided to write about her abortion because she now has a daughter: 'Should she ever have to face the same difficult choice I would wish that she could be treated with dignity and care in her own country.' </p> <p>Whether this mother's wish is granted will depend on how Bertie Ahern, the Prime Minister, decides to approach the issue. An all-party parliamentary committee has been hearing evidence for months from doctors, lawyers and interested groups. Yet not a single woman who had had an abortion felt able to talk to the committee on her experience. </p> <p>One of the problems facing Ahern is that pregnancies are terminated in Irish hospitals, although this only happens when the mother's life is at risk. Doctors want to ensure that medical practice is not further restricted by any change in the law. Those who oppose abortion and are campaigning for a referendum on the issue want to see a blanket ban inserted into the Irish constitution. </p> <p>The committee's report will land on Ahern's desk this week. It is expected to lay out three possible courses of action. The first would involve holding a referendum on a plan to allow a pregnancy to be terminated where there is a specific threat to the life of the woman involved. This would exclude any threat by her to commit suicide. If passed, that would in effect roll back the 1992 ruling by the Irish Supreme Court that a 14-year-old girl, pregnant as a result of rape, should be allowed an abortion. </p> <p>The second option is to make no change. </p> <p>The third, and most controversial, is to allow pregnancies to be terminated in Irish hospitals in limited circumstances, but 'pro-life' groups say this would 'open the floodgates' to abortion on demand. </p> <p>There have been reports that Ahern favours a referendum. He is under intense pressure from four independent deputies in the Irish Parliament, on whose support his minority government depends, to go down this road. But he knows such a decision would plunge the country into a bitterly divisive campaign, with the very real possibility that any wording put forward for a change in the constitution would be defeated. Anti-abortion groups would see it as too liberal, while those in favour of a woman's right to choose would see it as too restrictive. </p> <p>One of the writers in The Irish Journey described returning home during the last abortion referendum to find 'I had done something which divided the country'. Perhaps the book will help put a human face on the issue, but we are a long way from ensuring that an Irish woman facing a crisis pregnancy is treated with dignity and care in her own country.</p>",
  "Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor, has been plunged into a fresh row over cronyism after it emerged that barristers at his former chambers have earned more than \u00a31 million in fees from lucrative government work since the last general election. <p>The disclosures will raise further questions over the intimate legal network surrounding the Lord Chancellor and the chambers he set up at 11 King's Bench Walk at London's Middle Temple. Tony Blair practised as a barrister there, and Irvine was his pupil-master. </p> <p>Government figures re-leased to The Observer reveal that the Lord Chancellor has used barristers at his old chambers more than twice as often as any others. </p> <p>Since the election, Irvine's former colleagues have been paid \u00a3125,000 by his department alone. Some three-quarters of this sum has gone to Philip Sales, who in Novem ber 1997 was controversially given the coveted post of Treasury 'devil' - a barrister who is used to give legal advice to departments right across Whitehall. </p> <p>According to an official at the Attorney-General's office, as well as the \u00a390,000 Sales has earned from Irvine's deparment, he has made more than \u00a3750,000 from work given to him from Treasury solicitors representing other parts of government. In addition, Sales - who charges \u00a3150 an hour - has been given lucrative work directly from other departments. </p> <p>In total, it is estimated he has earned more than \u00a31m from advising government departments since his former colleague Irvine became Lord Chancellor. Other barristers at 11 King's Bench Walk who have been given work by Irvine include James Goudie, who used to chair the Society of Labour Lawyers. </p> <p>Opposition MPs have dubbed Sales a 'Labour millionaire crony' and believe the use of Lord Chancellor's former chambers is a clear case of 'jobs for the boys'. </p> <p>Shadow Attorney-General Edward Garnier said: 'These disclosures highlight the sheer arrogance of the Lord Chancellor who appoints barristers from his old chambers to plum jobs and cares not a jot about public disquiet. Once again we have an example of cronyism infecting a Labour administration that promised one thing in opposition and has given us another in government.' </p> <p>The appointment of Sales as Treasury 'devil' was contentious as it used secret 'soundings' in the legal profession, a process condemned by Labour in opposition as a relic of the 'old boys' network'. </p> <p>Barrister Josephine Hayes took the Government to court, claiming that the process discriminated against women. She alleged Irvine had engineered the choice of one of his own former colleagues for the plum job that is regarded as an almost cer tain route to becoming a High Court judge. Sales, 35 at the time, was regarded as 'exceptionally' young and far less experienced than other front-runners. </p> <p>Despite opposition from senior judges, Hayes obtained details of the 'secret soundings' taken before his appointment, and this forced the Attorney-General to settle in order to prevent an embarrasing court case. The Government paid \u00a35,000 into a charity of Hayes's choice on condition that she did not disclose details of the material she had obtained. </p> <p>Whitehall sources told The Observer that not only was Irvine instrumental in the appointment of Sales but that, even before he was made Treasury 'devil', government lawyers were told to give him work ahead of others. </p> <p>Ministers insist Sales's appointment was made on merit, but the row could not have come at a worse time for Irvine. Later this month he will face the Employment Appeals Tribunal contesting a ruling that found him guilty of sexual discrimination for appointing a friend, Garry Hart, as his special adviser. </p> <p>Earlier this year Irvine was accused of cronyism over his appointment of judges. In July it emerged he made his brother-in-law, Sir Andrew Longmore, an appeal court judge. Last October Irvine also appointed Harry Hodge, husband of Education Minister Margaret Hodge and a longtime member of the Society of Labour Lawyers. </p> <p>A statement from the Lord Chancellor's Department said: 'The department seeks legal advice from a range of counsel, making use of specialists in various areas of law. However, in common with all government departments, we make extensive use of the First Treasury Junior [Philip Sales]. The First Treasury Junior is appointed by the Attorney-General to be available to advise all deparments on public law issues that require counsel's opinion. These figures are reflected in the earnings for 11 Kings Bench Walk Chambers.' </p> <p>Irvine resigned from 11 King's Bench Walk when he took his \u00a3151,000 a year job as Lord Chancellor. He is likely to return there when he leaves the Government. <br><br><a href=\"mailto:antony.barnett@observer.co.uk\">antony.barnett@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The cost of Tony Blair's private office has soared to \u00a310.8 million a year, according to figures released this weekend. <p>The increase, up from \u00a37.5 million a year when Blair came to power in 1997, has led to fresh accusations that the Prime Minister is centralising too much power at Downing Street. </p> <p>Since he swept into Number 10, Blair has trebled the number of advisers who work on policy. There are believed to be a record 18 private secretaries. </p> <p>'These figures reveal the increasingly presidential style of the Prime Minister,' said Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP who has been keeping track on Downing Street spending since 1997. </p> <p>'He is centralising more and more power at Downing Street and is bypassing Parliament to a greater and greater extent,' said Baker. </p> <p>Blair has long battled against the view that he is a 'control freak' who wants all important decisions taken within Number 10. His officials argue that there is now much more work and that extra staff are needed. </p> <p>Earlier this year figures revealed that Number 10 had to deal with 500,000 letters and parcels, an 84 per cent increase on the figure for 1998. Five years ago John Major's staff had about about 25,000 letters a year. </p> <p>But critics say that the large number of special advisers means that much Government policy is being drawn up by unelected officials. </p> <p>There has also been tension between the special advisers - there are now believed to be 78 across all departments - and civil servants who say that their role has been usurped.</p>",
  "Scores of criminals convicted overseas, including rapists and murderers, are being deported to Britain with virtually no official supervision, fuelling fears that they may reoffend. <p>An Observer investigation has found that up to seven arrive each week and around 100 have come back so far this year. In the past eight weeks alone two convicted murderers, two rapists, three child molesters and three armed robbers have landed at Heathrow after being released on parole abroad. Due to a loophole in the law, they fall outside the British parole and social security system. </p> <p>The ex-cons, mainly from North America, are dumped here because they were born in Britain but failed to take out citizenship in their new countries and so are automatically deported at the end of their jail terms. Many left Britain as children when their parents emigrated and have no memories of their home country. </p> <p>The problem is underlined by the fact that convicted killer David Wood, one of the notorious 'Canadian Krays', is likely to be deported from Canada to Britain by the end of the year. If successful at a December parole hearing, the former leader of a brutal Toronto gang will be put on the first plane to London. His brother, Philip Wood, sentenced for the same murder, came back in September. </p> <p>Together with his brothers, Philip and Colin, David received a life sentence in 1986 for killing Karen Thomson. She was going to testify against Colin, then her boyfriend, but she was knocked unconscious with a rock and left to drown in Lake Ontario. </p> <p>A Canadian crime story became a British problem because the brothers were born in Scotland. As one-by-one they are freed, they will be deported back to a country they last saw as children. David's parole chances are thought to be high. </p> <p>Colin Wood will follow six years later after having his sentence extended due to escaping. Only then will Canada's triumvirate of feared ex-criminals be reunited on British soil. </p> <p>If they were allowed to stay in Canada, the Wood brothers would be subject to stringent parole conditions and assigned a parole officer. But because they served their sentences abroad they - like all the other returning prisoners - get no monitoring in Britain. Deported sex offenders, who would be obliged to be on a national register if convicted in Britain, are under no obligation to tell anyone of their whereabouts. </p> <p>'With sex offenders sometimes we don't know where they are going, where they are living and what they are doing. It is a very worrying situation,' said Theresa Gilson, a case worker with charity Prisoners Abroad. </p> <p>The charity serves as the only safety net for the returning prisoners. It helps them find accommodation, jobs and sign on to the social security system. The charity has a policy that all sexual offenders must put themselves on the national register before helping them. But it admits some refuse. </p> <p>Many of those arriving at Heathrow are completely unprepared. In some cases the first time they knew they were to be deported was when immigration officials took them to the plane. Some arrive still wearing prison clothes and most have to borrow the Tube fare to London. Usually they sleep rough on the streets of the capital. They end up alone and penniless in a city most will never have visited before, which makes the temptation to reoffend strong. </p> <p>'That is our greatest worry. There is a strong incentive to reoffend when you are put in that situation and there is nothing in place to help you or supervise what you are doing,' said Gilson. </p> <p>Many of those returning are more tragic than dangerous. They have been convicted for minor offences and are now banned from ever returning to the countries they grew up in. </p> <p>One such is Stuart Milne, who was born in West Ham but left at the age of 10 months when his parents moved to California. Thirty-four years later he returned to London to sleep on its streets after a drink-driving conviction led to a prison sentence and automatic deportation. He went from working in the computer graphics industry near Silicon Valley to relying on East End soup kitchens. He left a girlfriend and a child behind and is permanently banned from travel to the US. </p> <p>The Home Office admits there is a problem and is looking at ways to plug the legal loophole.

  "Twenty years ago this weekend Brendan Hughes was an IRA icon who had just started the second week of his hunger strike for political status. <p>But in an Orwellian twist two decades later the former Belfast IRA commander is deemed by his former comrades as 'unacceptable' even to mediate in a potentially murderous republican dispute. </p> <p>Hughes, a former cellmate of Gerry Adams in Long Kesh, was a hero of the republican movement in 1980 after fasting for 53 days in the struggle for political status. </p> <p>Last Saturday the one-time IRA leader and close confidant of Adams offered himself up as a go-between to stop the intimidation of republican dissenters such as former prisoner turned academic Anthony McIntyre. </p> <p>McIntyre's home in Ballymurphy - the republican estate where Adams grew up - has been picketed by a Sinn Fein-organised crowd on two occasions over the past fortnight simply because he publicly blamed the IRA for murdering Real IRA member Joe O'Connor in the area. </p> <p>The Republican Writers' Group, comprising former IRA prisoners such as McIntyre, has demanded a 'community inquiry' into O'Connor's death. McIntyre and his American partner Carrie Twomey believe the pickets are a precursor to them being driven out of Ballymurphy or even killed. </p> <p>Hughes also said he was prepared to speak to the Real IRA to dissuade them from taking revenge for the murder of O'Connor, who was shot in Ballymurphy on 23 October. His family said the Provisional IRA was responsible. </p> <p>'I asked Billy McKee [a former IRA leader] to offer ourselves up as intermediaries to try to stop any blood-letting that might take place. I got agreement from him and then I went to the IRA and put our names forward. But I was told by the IRA that I was not acceptable as a mediator,' he said. </p> <p>The reason he was given was that he had been on a picket along the Falls Road calling for the same rights he went on hunger strike for in 1980 - political status for republican prisoners. </p> <p>'I went on a white line picket for a Continuity IRA prisoner after long thought. I knew it would cause a bit of controversy even though I am not a member or supporter of Republican Sinn Fein. </p> <p>'That was one of the reasons I could not be acceptable as an intermediary. I made it clear to the people on the picket that I was there for the simple demand for political status for their prisoners, that was the reason why I went on hunger strike. Yet that makes me unacceptable to the IRA. It is truly Orwellian,' he said. </p> <p>A legend in the IRA and the republican community, Hughes led the organisation's Belfast Brigade from internment to his arrest in a plush, south Belfast suburb in 1974. Posing as a respectable businessman, Hughes ran some of the IRA's most daring and ruthless operations including the bugging of British Army headquarters in Northern Ireland. His long track record in the Provisionals, he admits, makes it difficult, even painful, for him to speak out publicly against his old comrades. </p> <p>Hughes, like McIntyre, is totally opposed to the resumption of violence although they criticise Sinn Fein's political strategy as a sell-out of long-standing republican principles. </p> <p>'A few young Real IRA members approached me at Joe O'Connor's funeral and asked me for advice. I told them they should put the guns away, that the war was over and they were going to get themselves killed. The war has been fought for 30 years and there is no more it could achieve.' </p> <p>McIntyre, who served 16 years in the Maze for the IRA, said he was disturbed that Gerry Adams, writing in the Irish-American paper The Irish Voice , labelled him as a 'fellow-traveller of the Real IRA'. </p> <p>'Mr Adams knows what he says is untrue. I am on record as saying the Real IRA should put away their guns, call off their campaign and cease to exist. The slur is extremely dangerous and is being used to suppress peaceful dissent and free thinking. </p> <p>'I really believe that if they can get away with it they will expel us or worse, kill us. This is guilt transferral and what's more the Provisional IRA who killed Joseph O'Connor sent out a message. That message is that the use of the gun to sort out political disputes is still legitimate post-Good Friday. This message reinforces the intellectual pool from which armed republicans drink,' McIntyre said. </p> <p>Carrie Twomey, who is six months pregnant, was alone in the house when the pickets descended on her door last Wednesday evening. </p> <p>She called on Bairbre de Brun, Northern Ireland's Health Minister and Sinn Fein Assembly member for the Ballymurphy area, to demand an end to the pickets. </p> <p>'I am concerned how the stress of the last few weeks has affected my child,' she said. </p> <p>'If the Health Minister who's from my area is concerned about the health of her constituents, how does that square with her party sending mobs to my house?' </p> <p> The Observer put this question to de Brun's department on Friday but to date the Sinn Fein Minister has failed to reply. </p> <p>Hughes meanwhile, who is still held in high regard by many ordinary IRA members across Ireland, is bewildered over Sinn Fein's entry into a Stormont parliament he once set out to physically destroy. </p> <p>'The British Army is still occupying Divis Towers on the Falls Road, so why don't they hold pickets about that instead of picketing a republican home such as Anthony's andCarrie's. </p> <p>'Now they're calling me a dissenter for speaking out in defence of free speech and asking who shot Joe O'Connor.' </p> <p>He added: 'I don't mind being labelled a dissenter, I've been a dissenter all my life.'</p>",

A film in which you play a woman who has the power to heal, and I'm interested in what drew you to that story.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, in about 1977 I was in Greece making a film with Jules Dassin called A Dream of Passion, and my agent called me and said that there was this script called Resurrection in which Jesus Christ comes back to Earth as a woman. I said, 'Oooh. I like that.'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>So they sent me the script and then the director and the producer came to Athens to meet me and I said that I really liked the idea of the script, but I didn't like the script itself. It was about this school teacher who went to Jerusalem and started bleeding from the palms. It just didn't make an awful lot of sense to me. </p> <p>So I suggested that they did a script about a woman who was a very ordinary housewife in contemporary society who develops some of the abilities that Jesus had - like healing and so forth. At the time I was doing a lot of reading about the re-emergence of the goddess and I liked the idea of reuniting sexuality and religion - a religious figure who was also a sensual being. I sketched out a rough story for them and the director said, well it's a good story but we have the go-ahead from Universal to make this script and did I want to do it. I said no, and they left. </p> <p>When they got back to their hotel the producer called me and said, 'We like your story more than our story, and with your permission we'd like to go back to Universal and ask them if we can start over and find a writer to write your story.' So they did. </p> <p>They found a writer called Lewis John Carlino, who came to my house in New York and stayed with me for about a week, and I told him my life story plus all that I was reading and studying at the time, and out of that came the script that he wrote in, I think, 18 days. We got a new director, Daniel Petrie, and out came Resurrection. </p> <p>I loved it, and it has had a lot of meaning for a lot of people because it deals with death a lot and the passing over to the other side and the experiences of some of the people I had read about who had had near-death experiences, and that was put into the film. So many people have written and told me how they have been with their parents and helped them cross over because of Resurrection. And that's pleased me very deeply.</p> <p>It wasn't very successful because at the time Universal had no faith in it, and they had another film, which I won't mention, that they had already released and made a lot of money from, with an actress in it who they felt had a good opportunity to win the Best Actress award. And my reviews said, 'Just as so-and-so looked to have a clear shot at the Oscar, along comes Ellen Burstyn in Resurrection.' So Universal made an executive decision to put all their money behind the film that they thought was very successful. And it was. And she did win. </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>They pulled Resurrection out of the theatres, so it was running in New York and I was nominated for the Oscar and there was no ad in the newspapers to say it was running. So it was literally killed. Which is a very painful experience, you know, when you love a piece of work and it comes out the way you wanted it to come out and people like it, but the studio decides to kill it. That's one of the glories of showbusiness.</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> In the 1980s you moved to work primarily in television, and did some stage work too.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Yes, I did both stage and television, and I did some films. A couple. But because Resurrection didn't make money because it wasn't successful, nor did Same Time, Next Year - those two films in a row didn't make money, they were both Universal, and that was it girl, you know! It's a sin to have your films not to make money. Strangely enough, both of those films have a huge following now, and they're shown on television quite often, and I hear from people all the time that one or the other is their favourite film, so...</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> It also goes back to what you were talking about earlier on. How things were changing in the 70s, then the political changes in the 80s. Interesting, then, that in the 90s, certainly from a British perspective, we see you back on screen. It is almost as if at that point something changed again.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, I hope so. I think that the change began... I made a film a few years ago called The Spitfire Grill, and that didn't make much money either, but it was a good film and an independent film. It was more like the films that we were making in the 70s, so I think that a movement began with Sundance. I think that was the beginning of a new energy.</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> Let's talk a little about your two new films that are in the festival - The Yards and Requiem for a Dream - in both those films you are working with directors who are making their second features. Thinking about your career, it seems that you have worked a lot with directors in the early stages of their careers.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Yes. The Last Picture Show was Peter Bogdanovich's second feature, The King of Marvin Gardens was Bob Rafelson's second, and Alice was Marty's second. </p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> So is that coincidence, or is that something you specifically enjoy?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> I do like to work with young directors because it's such a difficult business that I think after directors have been around a while sometimes, not always, but sometimes their passion gets siphoned off because they get hurt. They become more conservative and get afraid to take the same kind of chances. </p> <p>For instance, James Gray with The Yards - it's a beautiful film, wonderful - the critics have gone after him with meat cleavers in the United States, and I just don't understand why. I hope he doesn't get discouraged and that he continues to make the kind of films that he makes so well. His first film was Little Odessa, which was a wonderful film. Yes, he's dark, he's attracted to dark and moody pieces, but that's where his heart is. I hope that he doesn't get discouraged.</p> <p>Darren, on the other hand, his film has been received without the same kind of rancour and he's being supported, so I think that that won't happen to him. But it's very, very hard on directors, and when I see a film by a director that shows promise, I want to get to 'em fast! <br><strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn4.ra\">Listen to the sound clip</a> (2 mins 18)]</strong></p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> Requiem sees you in another extremely demanding role. How were you persuaded to do that?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> By Darren's first film, Pi. When the offer came in from my agent I was playing Mary Tyrone in Long Day's Journey into Night at the Hartford Stage in Connecticut, and I had played Mary Tyrone the year before at the Alley theatre in Houston, so I was deep into addiction! And it's always a financial sacrifice to do a play, and I had just done The Yards, which was also a low budget film, so I was hoping for a large budget film...! </p> <p>Then in came this script with another very low offer, and another drug addict and a depressing and difficult part to play. I thought, 'Why should I put myself through that for hardly any money?' </p> <p>But I had heard about Pi, but hadn't seen it, so I put it on and within two minutes I thought, 'This guy's an artist and I can't wait to work with him.' So after I agreed to do it, I read the script again and really got into it And loving Sarah. But it took a while, because I was daunted by what I was going to have to put myself through. And rightly so!</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> Can you tell us what some of the greatest challenges were?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, first of all, physically, Sarah goes through an enormous transformation. She loses 50 pounds in the film, and goes from fairly sane to totally out of her mind. So for the first part of the film I was wearing a 40 pound fat suit, which is very, very uncomfortable. But the worst part was the neck.</p> <p> I had the neck glued on from my chin down to my bosom and all the way around. It was hard enough getting it on, but getting it off was torture, because you're in it for 14 to 15 hours a day and your skin absorbs all the glue. So you slowly take a little brush and start peeling it back, and when you get enough you cut it off and then keep going. </p> <p>It takes about an hour to get it off. And then all the glue is still in your skin, so you get hot towels to bring the glue up, and then glue remover, and then more hot towels which took another 30 to 40 minutes. My whole chest was bright red and covered in sores and bleeding. It was just horrible. </p> <p>Then we got to the 20-pound fat suit which I was supposed to get into. I went to Darren and said, 'I cannot get into the neck. Please!' Because it was also hard to shoot around it, because if you moved the wrong way it buckled in the wrong way. So, you know, I was always playing the neck in all those scenes!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>And Darren would say, you know, 'Great take, but we have to go again because the neck went funny.' So I refused to get into the 20 pound neck and he was very relieved because he was tired of shooting around it. Then after I got out of the fat suit we coincidentally came to a two-week break in my schedule, so I took off 10 pounds myself. So altogether that made 50 pounds. </p> <p>But I was always uncomfortable in that. Physically uncomfortable. Either from the fat suit, or the neck, or my severe dieting. Or wearing the camera. That was one of Darren's tricks. He designed this mount that goes over your shoulders and the camera is out in front or behind and, you know, you're the camera mount! My dress had to be made with special flaps to cover the mount. </p> <p>He's very inventive with his use of the camera, and innovative, so I was doing some creative things I had never done before. But then the hardest part was accessing the emotional depths of yourself that are necessary to realise a part like this. You basically torture yourself emotionally to get there. And the worst part is that you're never sure you're actually going to be able to do it, and it's such a relief when you do! <strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn5.ra\">Listen to the sound clip</a> (3 mins 22)]</strong></p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> It's time to open it up to the audience...</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it true that you rang William Friedkin and told him you were born to play Mrs MacNeil in The Exorcist?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> No. It's not true at all! I know he says that but I keep telling him that I wish we'd had a tape recorder because he mis-remembers! </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>There was a casting director at Warner Brothers who suggested me for it, and an appointment was made. I called Billy and asked him if we could have the appointment at my house rather than in his office because I would feel more comfortable there. he very kindly agreed and came to my house. I did call him, but I already had an appointment to see him. That's my version.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Had you read the book before?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> I can't remember if I read the book before or not.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I saw you twice in the Broadway version of Same Time, Next Year. How do you keep it fresh?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, you know, for me that's the whole job. The interesting thing about doing a play is to find a way to make it fresh and do it as though you were doing it for the first time. And that's what all the technique was about. Ways of getting to yourself in order to be in this moment and this time, and not in the performance you did last night or last week. I did that for six months and then a year went by before we made the film, and I had a change of partners. Alan Alda did the film, so it was like a new love affair! How I did it: I don't remember. That I did it: that's my job.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I saw Dream of Passion, and I was wondering what it was like working with the forceful personality of Melina Mercouri and how you put yourself in the role of Medea [Burstyn played a woman jailed for murdering her kids, Medea-style; Mercouri played an actress playing Medea in a classical tragedy who calls on Burstyn for inspiration].</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, Melina was wonderful. She's a character. She was like the character in the film - it was written for her by her husband and it draws on her life and her behaviour and who she is. I don't know how to say what it was like to work with her. It was Melina.</p> <p> I remember one time she came up to me and said: [Melina voice] 'How do you like this line?'. So she read a line to me and I said, 'It seems fine, fine.' [Melina voice] 'You don't think it's too much?' 'Well, ya, maybe a bit.' [Melina voice] 'Tell him. Tell Jules [Dassin]' 'Melina, he's your husband, you tell him!' [Melina voice] 'No. He don't listen to me. He has this...antagonism.'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>As for Medea, that was very difficult. I actually took that problem to Lee. I'll tell you what I did. I wanted to work on this central problem of killing. How you go about killing. Now, in the film I had to kill my children - well, I didn't want to get that far. I mean I can do flies, and cockroaches and ants, but that's about it. I couldn't kill a chicken, I couldn't kill a cow - I was a vegetarian too at that time - so I thought, well what is there that I could kill? I couldn't kill this and I couldn't kill that. If I brought an ant on stage that's hardly the same as killing your children...</p> <p>So I was at the Actor's Studio, thinking about this, and I happened to glance over to the other side of the stage and I saw the ugliest chair I have ever seen. And I thought, 'Well, I could kill that chair!' So I started building around that. </p> <p>I did an exercise for Lee, with everyone present, and created an imaginary child - but before I did that I stopped at the butcher's shop on the way in and got some lamb's liver, raw lambs liver, and at one point I put it in my mouth and rubbed it all over my face to experience the... to get past my own squeamishness was what I was doing. </p> <p>And then I created this little child, who was my darling boy, and then I went over and sat him on the chair and then proceeded to destroy the chair. And I found that that was what Medea was doing. She was not killing her children, she was killing her husband through her children because he had so destroyed her.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you tell us about working with Alain Resnais on Providence?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> He's so wonderful! I guess more than any man I've ever known he's a gentleman. He's so elegant. He has a very unique way of directing. He casts the film and then brings the actors together for two weeks, you rehearse every day and go over the script and you say if you want anything re-written. Then the script is finally finished - no more changes - and all the scenes have been played. Then he goes away for two days and edits the film in his head. </p> <p>So he only shoots exactly what will be on screen. So there is nothing on his cutting room floor. So in a scene where I'm talking and he's going to show Sandra nodding and shaking her head, he'll only shoot that and I'm heard off camera. I've never worked with any other director who works like that. It's completely unique to him.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> The Exorcist has been pushed back into public consciousness through the new cut. What do you think of it and how has it affected your career?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, it's been surprisingly important to my career. I didn't realise in the 1970s that that was the film I was going to be remembered for for the rest of my life.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>As a matter of fact, on the last day of Requiem for a Dream, Darren made this beautiful little speech for me in front of the crew and thanked me and said all sorts of nice things. I thanked him for giving me a role in a film that I might perhaps be remembered for as much as The Exorcist.</p> <p>I saw The Exorcist a few years ago at Radio City Music Hall when Billy and I went to see it. We were both appalled at the quality of the print. It looked like an old film, fading and it had pops and holes and squeaks. But now that it's been remastered it looks brand new, like it's just been shot. I like a couple of the added things, but the added doctor scene, I'm not so sure about. <strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/Burstyn/burstyn6.ra\">Listen to the sound clip</a> (1 min 17)]</strong></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Requiem for a Dream - how important was the book?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> It certainly deepened my appreciation of the script. Hubert Selby Jr's way of writing, for those of you who may not have read the book, the page is a solid block. It is not divided up into paragraphs and there is no 'he-said-she-said', he just flows from one person speaking to the next without identifying them. </p> <p>But the voices are so clear that you know exactly who is speaking. I've never seen anybody accomplish that on the printed page. Also, when you read the book, you realise how Darren's cinematic style is the perfect realisation of the book. I got more of an understanding of Sarah from reading the book, but most of what's in the book is in the film too.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You are going back to television. Why do a television series?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> No, it's not 'going back', it's 'also'. I liked the writing and I liked the cast. When you've been an actress for 45 years as I have, it's a feast or famine life and I thought that maybe it was time now to have a steady gig!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You talked about pushing films for Oscars. Are you ready to go through the circus to push Requiem for a Dream?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, you know what circuses are like. It's a lot of fun to take the rides and to take part in the bright lights. But it's also nice to go home at night and be quiet. So it will just me my job in the future 'hoopla' days to make sure that I balance it and have enough time to myself. I'm not someone who goes to a lot of parties or those type of events. But I try and enjoy it as much as I can. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I wondered which actresses you admired when you started out.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well my taste wasn't very good when I first started out. But later, when I began to appreciate the art of acting, I would say the actress I most admire is Vanessa Redgrave. I think she's just an amazing miracle of an actress. And I like Jessical Laing very much. And there is a new actress, Claire Danes, she's wonderful. But when I first started out I wanted to be like Betty Grable. That's not bad taste, I don't mean to insult Betty Grable, but it was just about wearing sequins and feathers and glamour!</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Could you tell us a little about The King of Marvin Gardens?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> I loved that film. It was very exciting to work on. Jack Nicholson - I think that's the best thing he's ever done, it has the least Nicholsonian things in it. He really created a character different from himself. It was a film that was killed by the critics when it came out. It was a 'What's happening to the arts in America?' response. Then when it was released on video a few years ago, everybody said, 'Gee! Where did this film come from? It's great!' And all the critics loved it. So... one tries not to be bitter!</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is there any role you passed up on that you regret that you didn't take up?</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Well, I try not to allow regret to live in me because I think it festers, and that's one way to become bitter and cynical - to clutch at you regrets and to carry them around like a wilted bouquet. I always wanted to play Joan of Arc. I've always wanted to do that. Now I'm thinking, 'Maybe there's a story in Joan of Arc's mother!' If I don't hurry up, her grandmother!</p> <p><strong>SH:</strong> Well, I think that's something we all look forward to seeing! It's fantastic you were here.

  "<p><strong> 1 Don't </strong> believe what they say. The overriding aim of most civil servants is to maintain their own system of order. They are in the game of controlling mass behaviour, so did not want to create panic by warning about BSE, for instance. They are not in the game of helping individuals express individual choice. Richard Crossman's Cabinet diaries repeatedly show him being told he could not do something by his civil servants only to see their excuses crumbling when he examined them. </p> <p><strong> 2 Accept </strong> that if you know your subject well you probably know more about it than the civil servants. The expertise of bureaucrats is in playing by the rules, rather than understanding the subject itself - hence the Treasury-designed rail sell-off which placed little emphasis on safety but maximised government revenues. </p> <p><strong> 3 Understand</strong> that you need to find a way to beat their skill with the rule book. 'Remember they are human beings,' says Rosemary, a former Department of Trade and Industry official. 'Shop around among the people you are dealing with and find someone you are comfortable with. As a human being, once they thaw, they will help you through the system.' Bureaucrats who take a pride in their job and who do understand the issues will sometimes break out of their conservative culture and training to help a good cause or someone they like. </p> <p><strong> 4 Always</strong> take things to a higher level, says Jim, a former Foreign Office high flier. 'Find someone who has an overview of the situation. If you keep going up, eventually your case will land on someone's desk who will be em- barrassed about it.' Getting your MP to write a letter on your behalf will nearly always ensure that civil servants will want to handle your case well. The worst pain a civil servant can usually experience at work is a reprimand from their masters, the politicians. </p> <p><strong> 5 Don't</strong> lose your temper, urges Jim. Frontline bureaucrats - whether in post offices, tax offices or JobCentres - are used to this and will tend to write you off completely as irrational. </p> <p><strong> 6 Never</strong> rely on the justice of your argument to win your case: ask the Guildford Four for their views on that one. Much of the law does not work on a common-sense level. But you can sometimes turn this to your advantage. While health and safety and employment legislation can be extremely complicated, there is often little attempt made to enforce it - a comfort for many employers.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Does the rate advertised apply to new purchases, or to transfers of debt from other cards, or both?</strong> </p> <p>Many credit-card companies offer an eye-catching rate for debt transferred from another card, but a much higher one on new debt added to the card. Confusingly the rates may be advertised as annual percentage rates (APRs) even though they apply only for a few months. </p> <p>Halifax is offering 3.9 per cent for debt transfers only, which expires after five months. New borrowing will be charged at 17.9 per cent (APR). The interest-free deals from Egg and Capital One, however, offer the free rate on purchases only, while debt transfers will be charged at 2.5 per cent (APR) and 7.9 per cent respectively. At the end of the introductory periods, Egg will charge 11.9 per cent and Capital One 12.9 per cent. </p> <p>If purchases are not repaid at the end of the six months, interest will start to be ap-plied from the beginning of the seventh month. While Egg's debt transfer rate is competitive, there are cheaper rates than Capital One's 7.9 per cent. </p> <p>Nationwide and RBS Ad-vanta have tended to specialise in low rates, but not necessarily the lowest, on both debt transfers and new purchases. RBS has an introductory rate of 2.9 per cent on transfers and purchases until next June, while Nationwide charges 3.5 per cent for six months. </p> <p><strong> How long does the rate last and what will I pay after that?</strong> </p> <p>Low rates are designed to lure borrowers who, the card operators hope, will forget that rates jump later. The alternative, at the end of a low-rate introductory period, is to switch, or surf, to another card. It may pay to have one card to repay accumulated debt and a second, perhaps an interest-free one, for purchases. </p> <p><strong> Is it a good idea to pay by direct debit?</strong> </p> <p>If you pay just the minimum required by the lender each month, this will normally be just 3 per cent of your balance. This is not enough to make inroads on substantial borrowing. </p> <p><strong> What's a monthly fee?</strong> </p> <p>Abbey National's internet bank cahoot is experimenting with a system that offers the option to pay a set monthly amount, or fee, rather than interest. This card also gears rates to customers' credit scores - they average 8 per cent APR - so is one of the more complicated in the market. The monthly fee option works out cheaper, it says, for people who do not pay down their debts. If you started the year with a \u00a33,000 debt and kept it constant at this level throughout the year, you would pay a monthly fee of \u00a316 a month, or \u00a3192 for the year, \u00a348 less you would pay in interest. But if you decide to pay off the debt in 12 months, interest charges would be \u00a3132. </p> <p>Tim Sawyer, cahoot marketing director, says: 'If you think \"I will always stay in debt\", this is the cheapest way to do it. But we allow people to repay the debt at any time.' </p> <p><strong> Does the card have an interest-free period?</strong> </p> <p>With one or two exceptions, credit cards will cost you nothing if you pay in full each month. Unless an annual fee is charged, and depending on how the card's charging system works, it will usually charge nothing if the bill is paid within 56 days of the purchase, the date it hits the account or the statement date. </p> <p>The length of interest-free grace depends on when you make your purchase during the billing cycle. Some cards have shorter interest-free periods; Alliance &amp; Leicester has a card with a 46-day period, as do cahoot, the Co-operative Bank, Direct Line, Northern Rock and Smile, while Egg and Woolwich have 45-day grace periods. Short interest-free periods also mean you will normally have only 15 days from the date of the statement to pay your bill. If you miss the payment, you might face penalty charges and interest backdated to when the transaction reached the account. </p> <p>If there is no interest-free period, you will pay interest from the date any new transaction reaches your account. Among those offering cards like this are A&amp;L, Bank of Scotland, First Trust Bank, the Co-op Bank and Halifax. Rates tend to be lower than on conventional deals because the cards are designed for habitual borrowers (see Have I Got the Right Card?) </p> <p><strong> What are the charges if I miss a payment or exceed my credit limit?</strong> </p> <p>Penalty charges are a feature of many cards with the lowest headline rates of interest. Late payment penalties, or spending beyond your credit limit may cost as much as \u00a320. </p> <p><strong> Is there any point in having a store card?</strong> </p> <p>Many retailers offer attractive discounts for buying with in-house cards. But do pay off your card each month to avoid punitive interest.</p> <p><strong> What about gold and platinum cards?</strong> </p> <p>Rates aren't necessarily lower; in fact standard rates are generally higher than on ordinary cards but you will normally get a generous credit limit and some bells and whistles such as accident insurance.</p> <p><strong>In credit, in control</strong></p> <p>Louise Bromley, 26, recently bought her first home, a flat in a 500-year-old building in Rochester, Kent. The move has put pressure on her finances and she has been using credit cards to help her equip her new home. But Louise feels she is in control. </p> <p>She has taken out a zero per cent card with internet bank Egg, which will finance new purchases over the next few months and hopes to cut interest bills on existing debt by taking advantage of the 2.5 per cent rate for debt transfers. She has debt of around \u00a34,000 in total, but has worked out a plan which she hopes will clear her debt by early next summer.</p> <p>Louise explains: 'What I will try to do is set a core amount to repay, say \u00a3400 or \u00a3500 a month, and try to get it paid off by May or June next year. Things I would usually put on a credit card, like holidays, I will pay off immediately.'</p> <p>All her new purchases will be interest-free. Egg will charge 11.9 per cent after Louise has had her card for six months and she hopes that it will maintain a competitive long term rates. 'No one wants to be switching all the time,' she says.</p>",
  "<p>About 5 million people in Britain live in homes built on flood plains - areas that the Environment Agency says are at risk of flooding. </p> <p>But far more householders than that could find their homes underwater, experiencing the misery of those affected by last week's storm, with evacuation and bills for ruined carpets, furniture and decor. Experts fear there may an even steeper cost: homes reduced in value, or even made unsaleable. </p> <p>One factor worrying the experts is the inability of a Victorian drainage system to cope with increased rainfall in ever-spreading built-up areas. At the end of the year, the Government will receive a report from the insurance industry urging a radical rethink to tackle this growing problem. </p> <p>What worries Professor Michael Clark, head of the so-called Sunami (Japanese for 'wave') working party, is the incidence of floods in places, such as Edinburgh, that are not usually regarded as vulnerable. </p> <p>'There is an increasing number of floods that aren't on the flood plain,' Clark says. 'These can be caused when there are flash floods and the drains can't cope. The drainage problem is as big a problem as river and sea defence. Ultimately, urban drainage will be seen as more of a focus of attention than building little walls around groups of houses that should never have been built in the first place.' </p> <p>The Victorians' work will have to be redone one day. Just as governments have neglected the transport infrastructure, so they seem to have neglected the sewers and drains. And just as Railtrack is now investing in safety, so local authorities will eventually have to invest in the drainage infrastructure. </p> <p>But whatever the cause of the flooding, fresh facts are starting to emerge. Insurance experts are expecting premiums to rise for building and contents cover. </p> <p>Peter Staddon of the British Insurance Brokers Association, says: 'It could be \u00a310 or \u00a320 per policy, I wouldn't be surprised to see it happen in the new year.' The exact increases are hard to work out. Falling crime figures could, he suggests, counterbalance the financial effect of greater flooding. </p> <p>Clark, who is based at Southampton University's Geodata Institute, takes a similar view: 'Because we spread the [flood element of] premiums across all policyholders, the premiums are better [than they would be otherwise for people affected]. But, if the problems continue, we will see a small increase for people living in the flood plains.' </p> <p>Insurers are almost guaranteed to push any extra costs on to the highest-risk policyholders, says Bryan Joseph, general insurance actuary at accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers: 'If insurers don't target their premium rate increases, other players will cherry-pick the good risks.' </p> <p>The outlook for people whose homes have been flooded more than once recently is difficult. The Association of British Insurers, normally eager to dismiss suggestions that people at particular risk might be unable to get cover, admits openly there is a problem. </p> <p>'In very extreme cases, it might mean excluding flood cover,' says a spokeswoman. 'In areas flooded once or twice a year, if the insurer knows that the local authority is looking at the issue, they will keep cover in place.' </p> <p>She accepts that insurers are less likely to do so if they do not believe the council involved will find a solution. </p> <p>A Norwich Union spokeswoman says: 'If someone has had their property flooded two or three times in the last two or three years, then premiums could go up to reflect the risk.' </p> <p>Looking longer term, new ways of dealing with the problems caused by flood, storm and insufficient drainage will have to be found. There are two main financial aspects to the problem: the cost of damage repair and insurance; and the effect on house prices. </p> <p>On the cost of repair, the Sunami working party has discovered that the UK is 'unique' in relying totally on the commercial sector and in having no financial input from government. The case for a contingency fund for disasters is one issue it will raise with the Government. </p> <p>Clark says other possibilities include putting 'the onus of flood defence on to individual properties'.This would mean that homes in flood plains would follow the example of the Netherlands, which builds them with raised, waterproof doors, air bricks that shut and other features that resist water. </p> <p>The Housing Minister, Nick Raynsford, is interested in this approach. </p> <p>He is pushing another development that could help: the publication of draft planning guidelines that encourage property developers and local authorities to consult insurers, lenders and other interested parties before new sites are built on. This would be particularly important when discussing the massive new house-building programme that the Government says is needed. </p> <p>Homes in areas that are flooded regularly could be worth less or, in extreme cases, become unsaleable, say experts. This would affect the residents of places hit badly last week, such as Yalding in Kent,and Lewes, East Sussex. 'I can't imagine that anyone would want to buy in Yalding,' says con veyancing solicitor Brian Marson of Marsons. </p> <p>But even people whose homes have not yet been flooded could find that the value of their home goes down because they are deemed to be a risk. </p> <p>The Environment Agency plans to publish national flood maps on its website by the end of the year at the latest. This will provide a free analysis of the flooding risk for every postcode in England and Wales. A similar system is already freely available to individuals through the Homecheck website. </p> <p>'This sort of system will impact on property value,' says Brendan Doyle of Homecheck. 'Surveyors and lawyers will have to become skilled at interpreting that information.' </p> <p>Buyers should be warned that many solicitors do not undertake this sort of check for conveyancing clients now, so potential problems can remain hidden. </p> <p>But, as more solicitors become familiar with the need to check for flood and other environmental risks, so the problems in more houses will become more obvious to potential buyers. It could be that disclosure is made compulsory , just as an analysis of earthquake and other hazards is required when people buy and sell homes in California.</p> <p><strong>How to wring out the cash for repairs</strong></p> <p>1 Ring your insurer or broker quickly to agree a plan of action. They usually prefer to send repairers and buy replacement items themselves. </p> <p>2 Don't throw out sodden carpets or other damaged items before your insurer's loss adjuster examines them.</p> <p>3 Take photographs or a video of the damage while the water is in the house as extra evidence.</p> <p>4 Expect to be rehoused in a hotel for a few days if the damage is mild; in a rented house if the repairs will take weeks or months. The insurer should pay.</p> <p>5 Contact your motor insurer if you have comprehensive cover and your car has been damaged by the water or a storm. If you are only covered for third party, fire and theft, you cannot claim.</p> <p>6 Don't expect to be reimbursed for repairs if your fence suffers storm damage. Most policies exclude such commonplace items, though some pay out for damage caused by a falling tree.</p> <p>7 Plan to stay with your existing insurer if you are making a claim now. It will be easier administratively to stay put while your claim is sorted out. Premiums may be higher with other firms once you have experienced flood or storm damage. </p> <p><strong>More information</strong></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.org.uk\">www.environment-agency.org.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.homecheck.co.uk\">www.homecheck.co.uk</a></p> <p>National Floodline: 0845-988 1888</p>",
  "<p>The frantic orgy of Christmas shopping threatened next month will rack up around \u00a39.6 billion on our credit cards, says the Credit Card Research Group. That's an average of about \u00a3160 for each man, woman and child in Britain. </p> <p>Some of it will be paid off, but a fair chunk will linger on our card bills for months to come, helping to bolster the already heavy levels of consumer debt. Banking industry figures show that the British have around \u00a364 billion of loans outstanding on plastic, overdrafts and personal loans. That is the equivalent of \u00a31,000 for each member of the population. </p> <p>Last week the Government summoned credit industry officials and debt advisers to a summit meeting to discuss the problem amid concerns in this country, and throughout Europe, that too many people are borrowing beyond their means. Citizens' Advice Bureaux dealt with almost one million debt enquiries last year and their debt caseload has risen by 37 per cent in the past two years. </p> <p> There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support the view held by debt counsellors that credit is turning into a source of misery for many borrowers. The Consumer Credit Counselling Service, another advice agency, says that the average amount, of borrowing among its clients is now \u00a321,000, compared with \u00a316,000 three years ago. </p> <p>The difficulties people are having with debt come at a time when unemployment is at its lowest level for around a quarter of a century. If the economic climate changes, threatening livelihoods, many more people may be facing severe difficulty in juggling their multiple borrowings. </p> <p>Yet for those who know how to use credit wisely there has never been a better time to buy on tick. </p> <p>Competition among lenders is intense, particularly in the credit card industry where there are 33 different organisations issuing plastic and more than 1,000 types to choose from. </p> <p>There are now 43 million credit cards circulating in the UK, 13 million more than just five years ago. But the UK market is seen by card operators as relatively undeveloped compared with the United States. According to the CCRG, UK adults hold an average of just under one card each, compared with 2.5 cards each held by American adults. But the market for credit and loans has never been so confusing for those who do not have their wits about them. One of the issues raised at last week's summit was the marketing of credit. </p> <p>The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, which runs the CAB network, believes that some of the small print in credit card literature should be blown up larger to emphasise the potential pitfalls of cards. </p> <p>Sue Edwards, an association policy officer, says too much emphasis is put on low headline rates of interest that may only apply to transfers of old debt, while a higher rate is applied to new borrowing. </p> <p>Advertising, often through junk mail, 'should give more information on the true cost of credit'. 'The advertising is very gimmicky. For example, it might say, \"We would like to write you a cheque\". </p> <p>'Some of the advertising makes it seem as though they will just give money away.' </p> <p>Another issue is the ease with which people can obtain credit. The Government and debt counsellors believe it is too easy to rack up large numbers of loans. Lenders are already sharing 'white' information about applicants, showing how many credit cards they have, what their limits are and whether they are up to date with payments. But it is unclear how effectively this information is being used, or how widely it flows within the industry. </p> <p>Consumer Affairs Minister Kim Howells announced at the summit that a task force would be set up to look at information given to borrowers and the decisions they make about applicants' ability to keep up payments. </p> <p>The task force is to report in the spring and although legislation has not been ruled out, the Government will favour a code of conduct to deal with the problems. </p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading is also concerned about debt, particularly among young people and will shortly begin an advertising campaign aimed at dissuading them young people from over-committing themselves during the peak spending period. </p> <p>Increasing numbers of young people are turning to debt counsellors for help with their cards. </p> <p>Against this background of concern, we present on the following pages a guide to how to get the best deals on tick and stay out of trouble at Christmas and throughout the year.</p> <p><strong>All aloan - so is it worth it?</strong></p> <p>What to watch out for when borrowing </p> <p><strong>Any penalties on settling up early? </strong><br>There may be repayment penalties of a few months' interest, but on some loans you may be asked to repay more than you first borrowed through a formula known as the 'Rule of 78'. It's painful but not illegal.</p> <p><strong>Does zero per cent really mean zero per cent? </strong><br> Retailers may offer this as an encouragement to buy furniture or electrical goods. The Office of Fair Trading has warned consumers to take care with this contract. Borrowers have been caught out by missing deadlines for settling bills on an interest free basis and have been locked into expensive contracts to settle debts (see case study). Also take care over deals that may offer to refund your interest as a cashback at the end of a loan term. You may have to abide by conditions, such as registering within a certain time to get the interest back, and you may have to remember to claim it at the end of a four- or five-year term.</p> <p><strong>Do I need credit insurance? </strong><br> Marketing aggressively on loans and credit cards and it can add hundreds of pounds to the cost of borrowing. Insurance policies may not cover all possible reasons for a drop of income, such as pregnancy. If the worst happened, consider whether you would be able to raise money to meet commitments, without resorting to expensive insurance.</p> <p><strong>Jill Insley on the cold reality of a refrigerator deal</strong></p> <p>Interest-free deals can prove very expensive if you don't read the small print, as one reader in North London has discovered. She and her husband bought a fridge-freezer and washer-drier from Comet in April last year, costing \u00a31,287 in total. Theyaccepted the store's 12-month, interest-free deal, aiming to pay in full within one year to avoid interest. 'We paid \u00a343.77 every month from the date of purchase, so at the end of the 12-month period we had paid \u00a3525.24 and had an outstanding balance of \u00a3761.71. As we were in the process of moving house this balance was not paid off at 12 months, but 14 months after purchase.' </p> <p>The couple assumed they would be charged interest on the outstanding amount for the two months after the interest-free period. They were horrified to discover that, because they had over-run the period of the contract, Comet was going to charge them 29.9 per cent interest for the full 14 months - an extra \u00a3404.61. Our reader says: 'The Office of Fair Trading tells me this is common practice, and there is nothing they can do. This does not seem like fair practice to me - I can't believe it's allowed. The law should be changed.'</p>",
  "<p>If you feel overwhelmed by the range of credit card offers being thrust at you in junk mail, advertising and by your own bank, take heart. The delicate art of choosing a credit card is now thought to be complicated enough to merit the attentions of a professor. </p> <p>He is Steve Worthington, professor of financial services marketing at Staffordshire University Business School, and he has teamed up with GM - the card arm of General Motors, makers of Vauxhall cars - to compile an index to guide confused consumers. </p> <p>Worthington divides users of plastic into three groups: </p> <p>\u0095 The transactor, who uses a card mainly as a method of paying, and clears all bills at the end of each month. </p> <p>\u0095 The revolvers, who never clear their balances. </p> <p>\u0095 The occasional revolvers, who sometimes pay off all their monthly bills. </p> <p>Worthington's assessment of cards goes well beyond interest rates, so his 'best buys' won't always match those that feature in tables, such as those carried weekly in Cash, which concentrate mainly on costs. </p> <p>He takes into account the methods the card companies use to calculate interest, and adds a weighting for 'stealth' charges, such as late payment penalties, and loyalty points schemes.</p> <p>However, even a study as exhaustive as this does not provide a permanent answer to anyone's ideal card. Changes in the market meant his latest survey, out last month, produced a slightly different recommendations from an earlier one.</p> <p><strong>Become a card-carrying expert </strong></p> <p>Apart from a mortgage, the main ways to borrow in the high street are with credit cards, store cards, personal loans, special deals arranged by retailers and overdrafts. The general rule is that overdrafts and cards should be used to finance short-term borrowing, while loans are more suitable for larger purchases that cannot be paid off in a few months. </p> <p>Competition among lenders in each of these parts of the credit industry has driven rates down across the board. Internet banks Smile and Cahoot, for example, have overdraft rates at 9.9 and 8 per cent respectively (annual percentage rates, or APRs) while Northern Rock bank is charging 9.4 per cent (APR) for personal loans over three years.</p> <p>But the most vicious competition is among credit card companies, where it is now possible to borrow for up to six months interest free. Capital One Bank and internet bank Egg are both offering interest-free deals. There are now introductory rates of less than 5 per cent from many card providers. This means that, depending on your circumstances and how quickly you can repay debt, cards may be the cheapest way to finance purchases that once might have been financed by a personal loan or overdraft.</p> <p>John Murray, director of the Credit Card Research Group, says: 'In the past, credit cards were a convenient method of spending, but not of borrowing. Now they compete with any other form of borrowing. You can get long-term borrowing on credit cards that challenges mortgage rates.'</p> <p>Buying a car on a credit card may even be feasible now, although on any large purchase you need to check for transaction fees, as some retailers will charge for payment by card.</p> <p>But there's a big 'if' to this rosy view of credit cards. The main problem with them is the flexibility that the lenders love to promote. One particular brand of card was marketed for years as a 'flexible friend', but when lenders talk about flexibility they really mean 'buy now and pay much later'.</p> <p>Lenders do make money out of you if you don't maintain long-term borrowing on your card; they receive around 1 per cent of each transaction on a card. But the best money is in the interest charged on the cards. For consumers, it all works like a dream as long as you don't stretch the flexibility too far, leaving debt on the card for too long. If you have an expensive card, such as Barclaycard, still charging a whopping 19.4 per cent, and never clear your debt, you will be paying through the nose. But the danger with the new breed of low-cost cards is that borrowers develop a false sense of security. Usually they apply for limited periods and then jump to double-digit rates.</p> <p>To get the most out of the card deals, you need the discipline, and sufficient income, to keep knocking back the debt.If you want to borrow over a longer period, don't look just at the short-term rate on a card: consider the standard rate as well and compare this with rates for personal loans.</p> <p>Borrowers who find that they cannot keep up with payments on a string of cards may be encouraged by their bank manager to take out a personal loan to repay the whole debt. If your cards include some that charge annual rates of around 20 per cent, and you cannot pay them off in, say, a year, a loan may work out cheaper. But it is better not to get into this position, and if you do decide to borrow to repay other debt, cut up the cards.</p> <p>Whether plastic is fantastic depends on knowing that you have the means to repay the cards quickly - and on understanding how the cheap deals work.</p>",
  "<p>'The customer is king' is true in theory, but mostly an ignoble lie in practice. The customers have moved to centre stage in management thought and talk, but in real life they remain, not monarchs, but second-class citizens. </p> <p>A whole new discipline, customer relationship management, or CRM, has been created and nourished by heavy corporate spending. Consultants plot 'value chains' backwards from the supposedly satisfied customer, and work out irresistible 'customer value propositions'. Call centres mushroom in unlikely locales to serve the customer better - and service just gets worse. </p> <p>In this customer-oriented culture, the internet is meant to reinforce the revolution by providing better, faster access and response. But companies actually selling over the net appear, according to a new survey, to be even less responsive in cyberspace than on earth. The PLAUT business and technology consultancy, investigating returns policy and performance, found that only 15 per cent of surveyed e-retailers offered excellent service. The rest provided after-sales treatment that ranged from mediocre to abysmal. </p> <p>Service failure is not skin-deep. Its causes go far into the heart of management performance. The mistakes are never isolated, unfortunate examples. They invariably spring from defects of the system and those who design and supervise that system. The great American quality guru, W Edwards Deming, had it right: 85 per cent of all defects are down to management - not to the workers. </p> <p>No doubt, airline managements, for example, claim to strain nerve and sinew to serve customers better in the skies. Back on earth, though, you sometimes can't contact their salespeople at all. Call centres refer you uselessly around the press-button menus, tell you that 'all our operators are busy' (as if you didn't know) and that your call 'is being held in a queue', which you also know full - and furiously - well. </p> <p>Adding patronising insult to injury, an automated voice may tell you that 'your custom is valuable to us', thank you for your patience (as if you had any alternative), and even (this is British Airways) boast that the endless wait is down to the success of their latest wondrous promotion. All this is laced together, naturally, by hideous music. Try to ring BA's head office to scream for help, and you find, bizarrely, that nothing is listed, only an 0345 number - which takes you straight back into Voicemail Hell. </p> <p>All customer relationships rest on personal contact between the buyer and the seller. There are sound reasons, apart from lower cost, for automating that contact as much as possible. But the systems have brought down an iron wall be-tween customers and suppliers. This is strange, since the supplier's staff also shop and buy. Top managements must surely sometimes be infuriated by other people's awful systems. Why do they persist with their own? </p> <p>The answer runs deep into the realities of management. Executives talk about customers as if they are some strange and separate breed, described with demeaning phrases like 'punters' and 'bums on seats'. The executive bums are similarly insensitive to the most important customers of all - their own staff. These customers depend on top management for sensible strategic direction, the effective operation of efficient systems, and proactive treatment as humans, not as 'human resources'. </p> <p>When staff are mismanaged, customers inevitably suffer. That's why travel expert Hal Rosenbluth entitled his book on customer service The Customer Comes Second. To put your external customers first, in other words, put your employees first. Hard statistical evidence has established a clear link between three types of satisfaction: employee, customer and shareholder. Satisfy the first, and the customers love you more: investors follow suit as sales and profits duly rise. </p> <p>But many managers, even retailers, whose customers are highly visible, prefer the ivory tower to the store floor. They hatch their absurdities (some of them manifest, like Sainsbury's low-price advertising disaster with John Cleese) behind closed doors. Impervious to suggestions and criticisms from staff at the sharp end, and to the potential huge contribution of middle managers, they are hardly likely to listen to the customers, who are supposed to be kings (and queens). </p> <p>Yet Andy Grove, the mercurial chairman of Intel, emphasises that customer complaints, 'both internal and external' are 'a very important source of information'. That's patently true. So how chief executives answer personally addresscomplaints - or don't - speaks volumes. There are too many like the telecoms boss who, upon receiving a heartfelt moan beginning 'the service you provide to Cellnet customers is awful. I hope that this letter will not prove my point all over again by being entrusted to the customer service people for response'fulfiled the prophecy. </p> <p>Properly used, the internet, like other hi-tech systems, can improve responsiveness. That won't happen with a website like BA's, which lists a 'dedicated' queue-up helpline, but gives neither names nor email address for 'customer relations'. Likewise, established retailers can - and should - also benefit from the web. Yet the serious faults identified in Plaut's study included, not just a bundle of hyped-up dotcoms, but also high street names: WH Smith, Dixons, Tesco, Sainsbury, etc. Most surprising is the performance of Dell Computer, whose website generates gigantic volume but flunked the returns test. </p> <p>The sad experiences suggest that senior managers never take the elementary step of anonymously sampling their own service and services. If they are afraid of uncovering a can of worms, that's probably what they will find. Instead they should always be investigating and eradicating, digging right down to the underlying causes. Incommunicado bosses who delegate customer care to underlings, and never check their miserable performance, are themselves infected by systemic diseases that only they can cure. That vicious circle is everybody's root problem.</p>",
  "<p>Are with-profits bonds, traditionally seen as a safe bet, about to become the next financial scandal? New rules governing how the bonds are financed will cost the life insurance industry between \u00a315 billion and \u00a320bn by the end of the year, according to analyst Ned Cazalet. </p> <p>He says: 'The hit to with-profits will be as big as the pensions mis-selling bill.' </p> <p>The prediction follows concerns expressed by actuaries about the product. With-profits bonds are lump-sum investments that try to offer good rates of return without fully exposing investors to the risks of the stock market. </p> <p>The risk is minimised by a process known as smoothing - annual bonuses are paid out at a steady rate instead of at values equivalent to the top or the bottom end of stock market returns. </p> <p>The Financial Services Authority, the industry watchdog, now requires life offices to set aside more money to cover the cost of running with-profits business. Some may be forced to cut bonuses as a result. </p> <p>Prudential, which sells the market-leading Prudence bond, admits it will have to increase its reserves by 15 per cent to meet its commit ments. The Pru is strong enough to take the hit, but other companies may not be. </p> <p>In its FSA returns, Royal &amp; SunAlliance has revealed it has set up a facility which will let it pump shareholders' money into subsidiary SunAlliance and London. The move was prompted by the poor performance of the stock and bond markets over the past year, but will be exacerbated by the changes to the with-profits regulations. </p> <p>Cazalet says other life offices likely to feel the strain include Axa Sun Life, Clerical Medical, Equitable Life, Friends Provident, Scottish Life, Scottish Mutual, Scottish Widows and Standard Life. </p> <p>In a separate move, the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries voiced its concerns about with-profits bonds earlier this year after it found a mismatch between perceived bonuses and the reserves set aside by life insurance companies to underpin their promises. </p> <p>Life offices were structuring their bonds so that they paid the best rates in the early years. This enabled the insurers to market the bonds as an alternative to deposit accounts on the basis of their attractive headline rates - as much as 9 per cent in the first year. Deposit account rates have plunged from about 10 per cent to 4 per cent in the past 10 years. </p> <p>However, the actuaries concluded that the with-profits rates may be misleading as no one usually sees the returns promised after just one year without paying a surrender penalty - the bonds are designed to be held much longer. They wrote to some members informing them of these concerns, prompting fears of a repeat of the endowment crisis. </p> <p>John Hylands, a member of the FIA's life board, says: 'There are concerns over the marketing practices of particular providers, but we do not want to give the impression that the product itself is flawed. The vast majority of with-profits bonds are perfectly OK. We just want some life offices to change the way they are promoted.' </p> <p>Life office Norwich Union has already closed one bond to new investors, citing, in a letter to independent advisers, the furore surrounding headline rates . </p> <p>Patrick Connolly of Bath-based financial adviser Chartwell says: 'As well as the change to headline rates, charges will have to be more explicit, and competitive forces will mean that commission will come down. Pressure for regulation will come from consumers. Companies will want to get in there and do it first.' </p> <p>He says two providers have already changed the formats of their with-profits bonds for 2001, making them more transparent and cutting commission rates. But he still thinks a clampdown on the bonds is 'inevitable'. </p> <p>The FSA admits it is keeping an eye on with-profits bonds after witnessing an explosion in sales in recent years. In 1994, \u00a32.2bn was held in with-profits bonds; in 1999 it was\u00a312.1bn. </p> <p>The FSA's Jackie Blyth says: 'They are on our radar, but that will not necessarily culminate in an announcement. We are looking at with-profits bonds as part of our usual supervising and monitoring visits.' </p> <p>So can you still rely on with-profits bonds to give you good returns with minimal risk? Cazalet warns you not to get sucked in by headline rates. He says potential investors should look at the ability of a life assurer to offer good rates of return in the medium- to long-term, because the money should be invested for between five and seven years. </p> <p>He advises to check with an independent financial adviser that the life office holds between 75 and 80 per cent of its investments in equities and property. </p> <p>Otherwise your bond could underperform because the assurer will not have the financial strength to smooth out the annual bonuses. </p> <p>Life offices that comply with Cazalet's real assets criteria are Axa Equity &amp; Law, Scottish Mutual, Prudential, CGU and Liverpool Victoria.</p>"
