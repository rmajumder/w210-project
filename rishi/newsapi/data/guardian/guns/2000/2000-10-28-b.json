  "Gerald Corbett, the rail boss blamed for the chaos engulfing the network, is set to be axed, The Observer can reveal. As massive disruption spread across the country yesterday, sources revealed that Corbett, head of Railtrack, is to be ousted within weeks. <p>He is being blamed for what has been described as the appalling state of Britain's railways, which emerged following the Hatfield crash 12 days ago. </p> <p>Westminster sources last night revealed that John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, and Lord Macdonald, the Transport Minister, have 'no confidence' in the Railtrack chief executive. </p> <p>However, he will not be forced out of his job until he has 'cleared up the mess' which has led to a nationwide slowdown while emergency repairs are carried out, following revelations that thousands of track faults had been ignored. </p> <p>The widespread disruption and road congestion caused by train delays and cancellations in the wake of the crash are believed by transport experts to have already cost the economy up to half a billion pounds. Romanian engineers are being flown in to try to speed up the repairs. </p> <p>The rail industry is set to lose a similar amount in fines, compensation to passengers and lost ticket revenue as people switch to other forms of transport. It will be months before the system is back to normal, and the urgent track repairs are being hampered by a shortage of staff. According to the rail union RMT, the number of trained maintenance workers has halved to 15,000 since privatisation. </p> <p>Corbett's fate will probably not be sealed until the Government has seen the safety report, expected 'around the turn of the year', into the Hatfield derailment. </p> <p>Sources close to the investigation now say it looks likely that, although maintenance contractor Balfour Beatty had not carried out its work well and is not clear of blame, Railtrack had been told that the track was in dangerously poor condition but failed to close the line, replace the track or impose speed restrictions. </p> <p>'Gerald Corbett is damaged goods,' said the senior industry source. 'He does not have the confidence of Prescott or Macdonald and he is basically a caretaker. When the facts of Hatfield and broken rails come out his position will be completely untenable.' </p> <p>The Railtrack chief offered to resign the day after the Hatfield crash when it emerged that a broken rail was probably responsible. </p> <p>Prescott has been notably mute on the subject of Corbett and it is no secret that he is 'not a fan' of the jovial but pugnacious chief executive. It is understood in Whitehall circles that while the Government is putting on a show of support for unity and stability in the industry while it deals with the crisis, Corbett is seen as a lame duck. </p> <p>As the head of a private company, he cannot directly be forced out by Ministers, by rail regulator Tom Winsor, or by Sir Alastair Morton, head of the Government's Shadow Strategic Rail Authority. </p> <p>But as a privatised, regulated monopoly which was handed all British Rail track, signalling, station and land assets in 1994 and subsidised by taxpayers to the tune of \u00a31.3 billion a year, the authorities have some legal and political clout over Railtrack. </p> <p>The Government has the option of removing Railtrack's operating licence, which would probably result in it being taken over by another company. Even the threat of this would probably result in Railtrack directors deciding to sacrifice Corbett - and possibly themselves in a boardroom clear-out - in order to secure the company's survival. Industry sources regard this drastic option as Prescott's 'nuclear button'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, it emerged last week that Railtrack had probably been told the track outside Hatfield station was in a dangerous state, but a 'catastrophic failure in the chain of command' and 'management incompetence' within the company and in its links with Balfour Beatty meant repairs were fatally delayed. </p> <p>The senior industry source said: 'You did not need a magnifying glass to see this rail was in poor condition. It was not a hairline crack, you could see it from 10 metres away and Railtrack had plenty of time to fix it.' </p> <p>Prescott has already asked Morton to investigate whether there is a conflict between safety and commercial interests. The Transport Bill, which includes stronger powers over the rail industry, is still wading through Parliament and is in danger of falling before it becomes law because of the row over the sell-off of air traffic control. </p> <p>It has also been revealed by the Health &amp; Safety Executive that Railtrack has sometimes failed to act over warnings of danger points on its network. </p> <p>Two months before the Hatfield crash it took seven weeks and threats of legal action for Railtrack to obey a demand for 20mph speed limits outside Manchester's Piccadilly station. Signals had become partially obscured by weeds and drivers were passing them on red. </p> <p>An HSE source said: 'This gives you an impression of the way they work. They are not on top of doing what they say they are doing.'</p>",
  "Glasgow, 3.30pm on Thursday. Preceded by a gentle, recorded harp strum, the cheerful conductor welcomed passengers aboard Virgin Train's 15.38 Glasgow Central to London Euston service with good news. Against all the odds, the train was prepared and would depart from Platform 1 on time. <p>We passengers, who had arrived braced for unhappy tidings, settled back in our seats, picked up our newspapers and smugly congratulated ourselves on our uncanny ability to sidestep the near-paralysis to which Britain's crumbling rail network had been reduced last week. </p> <p>At 3.39pm, another tinny harp strum. This time, the conductor said, there had been a slight hiccough: there was no driver. Through every carriage swept the resigned groan of travellers. 'We'll be on our way as soon as we find him,' the Tannoy voice added half-heartedly. </p> <p>It was 40 minutes before the driver appeared for duty. Before it had left the platform in Glasgow, the service was almost an hour behind the timetable. This was an inauspicious start. There was worse to come. </p> <p>This weekend the rail network is undergoing its biggest repair programme for more than a century. More than 20,000 Railtrack staff are working to repair 41,000 metres of rail identified as unsafe in the wake of the Hatfield derailment 12 days ago. Across the country, engineers have identified 1,850 rails with hairline cracks similar to those responsible for the latest tragedy. </p> <p>But with 20mph speed restrictions in operation on more than 160 stretches of line and little agreement on how quickly the operation can be completed, it is the hundreds of thousands of passengers, hit by widespread cancellations and severe delays, who are being forced to suffer. </p> <p>Like us unfortunate souls on the 15.38 last Thursday. For a mid-afternoon service, the train was busy; all the seats filled with business people, Scots heading to London for a long weekend, English families returning south at the end of the half-term break and tourists whose quick jaunt north had turned into an ordeal by rail. In the spaces between carriages, those unlucky enough to have been too late to get a seat made themselves as comfortable as they could as we finally pulled out of Glasgow. </p> <p>We at least had the small consolation that the train was moving at all. It was one of the first cross-border services to leave Glasgow after Railtrack's sudden decision to close the busy West Coast Main Line between the city and Gretna on Wednesday and equally sudden decision to reopen it on Thursday. Until the 15.38, passengers had been ferried on buses to Carlisle to pick up trains to take them further south. </p> <p>The West Coast Line is among the worst hit by years of disrepair. It is barely 100 miles from Glasgow to Carlisle, but on that stretch of track last week Railtrack engineers identified 179 hairline cracks. At least 32 of those sites require immediate repair or remedial work. Even taking all this into account, however, we remained warily confident that we would get to our destinations in a reasonable time. I had been assured by the man at the ticket window that 40 minutes late would be about as bad as it got. On top of the 40 minutes we had already waited for the driver, that would mean getting into Euston by 10.30pm, as against the scheduled time of 9.09pm. A respectable result given the poor start, especially as it meant being in London in time for last orders. </p> <p>For the first hour out of Glasgow, things seemed fine. Admittedly, the train may not have been going flat out, but it was still moving at a steady clip. Twice it had slowed right down, but both occasions had been mercifully brief. Then, at 5.34pm, we stopped. On the steep hillside to the right, a few sheep wandered down for a closer look before continuing their grazing. Through the trees down to the left, traffic flashed south on the M74. </p> <p>After a few minutes, just as the motorway buses began to take on a Space Age air of sleek efficiency, the train lurched forward into motion. Just. We set off so slowly that the sheep were still able to overtake us in search of fresh grass. As the sky blackened, the passengers on Coach C looked at each other in the grim realisation that the real trouble was just about to start. </p> <p>'I can't believe this is happening again,' said Lauren Nicholls, a 20-year-old student from Vancouver. 'I travelled up to Scotland from London on Tuesday and it took me 10 hours. I've been up here for two days and I've spent most of that on these trains. This whole trip has been a disaster.' </p> <p>We trundled on. By 6pm, we should have been long past Carlisle. As the lights of a town finally started to appear, some passengers gathered their belongings and made their way towards the doors. The train rolled along a platform and seemed to be about to stop. Then a sign passed the window: Lockerbie. Nearly two and a half hours after our scheduled departure, we had yet to reach the border. </p> <p>At 6.39pm, the train finally pulled into Carlisle. According to the conductor, we were now running 107 minutes late. On Coach C, the response was muted. A sort of Dunkirk spirit had kicked in as a group of passengers swapped stories of previous losing battles with the West Coast Line. </p> <p>David Gordon, from Motherwell, recounted the time he, his wife and two children had been on a train north when it had broken down at Oxenholme station in the Lake District and they had had to wait for two hours on a bus. </p> <p>Niall Thomas was not to be outdone. The IT consultant from Glasgow had been on his way to a stag night in Newcastle recently when, after many hours of delay and still far short of their destination, it was announced that the train was terminating where it stood. 'The guy came on and said that anybody travelling to Newcastle should try again the next day,' said Thomas. 'The worst thing was, the groom-to-be was with me, so he missed his own stag do.' </p> <p>'It is a fantastic way to travel when everything goes well,' sympathised Gordon. 'But when it goes wrong, it seems to go horribly wrong.' Prophetic words indeed. </p> <p>The train continued through the North-West at funeral pace. At times, the only way to be sure we were still moving was by watching the dark outlines of the trees that passed the windows in painful slow motion. By 7.35pm we reached Oxenholme, the third of 13 stops. Preston came into sight 40 minutes later, but with each mile that barely passed beneath our wheels London seemed further away. Gradually, the curiously British thrill at a shared ordeal was replaced by boredom, then frustration and finally anger. </p> <p>In the buffet car, Paul Donald and Tony O'Keefe had had enough. Their journey had began at 6.15 that morning, 217 miles north of Aberdeen on an oil rig in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. They should have been in the pub with their mates in Liverpool at the start of two weeks' leave. Instead they were still stuck on a train somewhere to the north. 'This is driving me fucking insane,' Donald growled. 'This lot are taking the piss. If they want to shut down the railway, they should do that, but if they are going to take \u00a375 off me for a ticket they should at least try and get me there. They're too greedy to say no to the money. That's their problem.' </p> <p>'It's those notice boards they put up in the stations with the efficiency figures,' said O'Keefe. 'It's always 98.8 something. Where the fuck do they get that garbage from?' The feeling of tempers rapidly fraying filled the air. Mine included. In the seat behind me, a small boy decided the best fun he could have was to lift up the tray table attached to the back of my seat and slam it down as hard as his little arms could. For a full half-hour he continued with his game, while his parents looked on, clearly relieved that it wasn't them he was bothering. I could take no more. 'Is there any chance you could get him to stop?' I asked his mother politely. 'He's only three, you know,' she snapped in reply and turned back to her magazine. </p> <p>Perhaps wisely, the train staff, other than the buffet manager, had been conspicuous by their absence. Apart from one early foray to check tickets, the conductor limited his presence to doleful Tannoy announcements at each station of the number of minutes we were now behind schedule. He was replaced at Crewe by a new man who walked down the train with the latest estimated times of arrival. </p> <p>At 9.09pm, the scheduled time for reaching Euston, we were still somewhere in the Midlands, north of Stafford. But the new conductor had some news: even at this pathetic rate, we would be in London between 11.25pm and 11.40pm. So when the buffet man announced at 10.30pm that he was closing for the night, we took that as a good sign. Wrong. At 11pm, the conductor came on the Tannoy to tell us that we would now reach Milton Keynes by 11.25pm, and London half an hour later. By a quarter to midnight, with Milton Keynes still to materialise, the conductor gave up making any predictions. </p> <p>Most of us had given up hope of ever reaching anywhere. As we lumbered through the darkness, it felt as if we had been abandoned to our fate as the rest of Britain tucked up for the night. Occasionally, we would slow down even more. But finally we reached Milton Keynes, then Watford. London could not be far off. Once again we had underestimated the seriousness of our predicament and it was not until 12.59am - nearly three hours 50 minutes late - that we pulled into Euston. Passengers piled out to be greeted by loved ones with the enthusiasm of those who had started to lose all hope. </p> <p>From Glasgow to London, a distance of 400 miles, had taken more than nine hours, almost the same amount of time as it takes to fly from London to South Africa, across some 53 countries and the length of the African continent. After all this, we deserved some good news and it finally came at Euston. There was another train at least an hour behind us. We were not the most unfortunate souls in Britain after all. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:stuart.millar@observer.co.uk\">stuart.millar@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Steve Norris, the maverick Tory party vice-chairman, has been ordered to tone down his outspoken defence of gay and ethnic minority rights. <p>His rebuke from the leadership will be seen as a setback for the liberal wing of the party, since Norris was brought in to woo non-traditional Conservative voters with a more progressive line on social issues. </p> <p>He has thrown himself into the job, backing same-sex registered partnerships to give gay couples inheritance and property rights, accusing party activists of sexism in failing to select women MPs, and attacking Lord Tebbit for 'ranting'. </p> <p>But even though William Hague knew Norris's views when he appointed him, the MP's colourful style has infuriated some Shadow Cabinet colleagues and made Smith Square nervous. </p> <p>Seb Coe, Hague's powerful chief of staff, is understood to have fired off a memo warning Norris not to stray off-message again and to refrain from personal attacks on other Tories. 'He has been told that if he doesn't stay in line he might find himself a very short-lived vice chairman,' said one insider. </p> <p>The move follows a sharp attack by MPs on Michael Portillo, who has led calls for a more inclusive agenda making gays welcome in the party. Baroness Thatcher is said to have told friends that the man she once regarded as her natural heir has become 'very confused'. </p> <p>The rebuke for Norris, a close ally of Portillo, has angered his supporters. 'Steve has just done what he was supposedly appointed to do, and he is now in trouble for it,' said one friend. 'The thing about Steve is that you can't really control him.'</p>",
  "Britain is planning to send a naval task force and 500 troops to Sierra Leone to help shore up the beleaguered United Nations peacekeeping mission in the war-torn country, it emerged yesterday. <p>The helicopter carrier HMS Ocean will return to the region accompanied by two other warships and support vessels as well as soldiers from 42 Royal Marine Commando. The vessels are currently on exercise in the Mediterranean, but would reach the West African state in days. </p> <p>The task force is expected to remain offshore near Freetown as a rapid and flexible reaction force in case the situation there deteriorates further and urgent action is needed. It will have no official role to play as part of the UN force, which has been hamstrung by a recent decision by the Jordanian and Indian components to withdraw. </p> <p>The news, revealed by the BBC Today programme, prompted condemnation from Tory Shadow Defence Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who warned that British troops could get dragged 'deeper and deeper into the mess and muddle of Sierra Leone'. </p> <p>The UN mission to the former British colony has suffered various setbacks in its attempts to bring peace to a country almost destroyed by a decade of civil war. In May, around 500 UN soldiers were taken hostage by rebels, forcing a humiliating crisis that saw British forces intervene to prevent the collapse of the country and the loss of Freetown to anti-government forces. </p> <p>About 200 British troops are currently in Sierra Leone training and arming a new government army to defeat the Revolutionary United Front, whose soldiers, often children, are notorious for mutilating prisoners and going into battle high on drugs. </p> <p>However, much of the country, including lucrative and illegal diamond mines, remains in rebel hands. </p> <p>The training mission has not been trouble-free. In August, 11 British soldiers from the Royal Irish Regiment were captured by the West Side Boys militia after detouring off a main road and driving into the jungle. The hostages were later rescued by the SAS and soldiers from the Parachute Regiment, but a fierce gun battle left one special forces soldier dead. </p> <p>Details and a timetable for the taskforce - to be known as the Amphibious Ready Group - are expected to be unveiled early next week. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said he could make no comment until the announcement was made. </p> <p>The move was backed by Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell, who called for the British troops to join the UN force. </p> <p>'If we want the UN mission to succeed, we should now assign British troops directly to the UN command,' he said. 'If the UN goes through another crisis like last May, then all the gains since then will simply be lost.' </p> <p>However, despite previous UN requests for a joint military operation with British forces, such a development is highly unlikely. </p> <p>Defence chiefs are almost certain to want to preserve their autonomy of action, especially with the UN force widely seen as incompetent and ineffective.</p>",
  "In a one billion-dollar campaign for the most powerful job on the planet, it is frightening that America is being offered a choice between two flawed scions of self-perpetuating political dynasties. <p>The rules of this fight, as Robert Reich explains on these pages, have meant that both George Bush and Al Gore have assiduously avoided the big issues in order to reassure the narrowest band of swing voters, while not scaring their own supporters. The campaign has become an election of concealment, avoiding key issues that confront America in the new millennium - its socially corrosive poverty, its pervasive culture of violence, its failing justice system and the wider role of America in the world.</p> <p>Al Gore, for all the slickness of his convention performance, has come across as arrogant and prone to exaggeration. In cutting himself loose from the Democratic Party's biggest asset, the formidable campaigning skills of Bill Clinton, his judgment has also come into question. Most worrying is the way in which, in his pursuit of the centre, he has downplayed issues formerly so important to him, such as gun control, poverty and social inclusion.</p> <p>But beneath his calculated evasion, Mr Gore remains wedded to continuing the broad thrust of the policies of the Clinton administration. His is a vision of an inclusive state which, despite its faults, would remain committed to social justice and to America's role as a force for constructive change in a wider world.</p> <p>Which brings us to George Bush, the candidate who really scares us, and who should really scare America. He has positioned himself as the Washington outsider, uncorrupted, as he would have it, by the cynicism of 'beltway' politics.</p> <p>But in a campaign where Republicans have outspent the Democrats by two-to-one, Bush represents a wider corruption of the American political system - by corporate self-interest.</p> <p>A Bush presidency would see a harshening of American society and a deepening of its social faultlines. In Bush's America, the rich would become richer, while moves to reform gun controls and judicial application of the death penalty would be set back a generation. A Bush administration would also rewrite his country's relationship with the world, rejecting cautious internationalism in favour of a new US unilateralism.</p> <p>On these grounds, we must hope that it is Al Gore - for all his flaws - who wins next week's election.</p>",
  "The case of James Bulger's murder began with a blurred surveillance shot of two boys, one big and one small, walking hand in hand from a shopping centre. It ended on a November evening in 1993, as Robert Thompson and Jon Venables left Preston Crown Court with the sentence of the mob upon them. 'Kill them. Hang them,' screamed the crowd, wishing the blue police vans bearing two 11-year-olds were bound for Tyburn rather than for cosy, council secure units specialising in the makeover of monsters. <p>By contrast, the final act in sentencing the Bulger killers was a low-key affair. The court of the Lord Chief Justice was half empty for Thursday's ruling, delivered by Lord Woolf in the mild and slightly halting manner of a newly-recruited Chatsworth tour guide. Several reporters bolted to file their stories at the mention of an unexpectedly low eight-year sentence, so missing Woolf's quiet punchline. 'I therefore set a tariff which will expire today,' he said, as Denise Fergus, James's mother, sunk her face towards the gold crucifix hanging round her neck.</p> <p>There were few talismans, in the subsequent reporting, of the triumph of good over evil. Instead, the gruesome details of the premeditated abduction, the paint poured into James's eyes, the crash of an iron railway plate on an infant skull and the body placed on a track to be cut in two by a goods train were rehearsed again, in a chronicle as horrible and familiar as if it had happened yesterday. But years have passed and Thompson and Venables, educated and remorseful, have made what Woolf called 'striking progress'.</p> <p>His decision to open their way to freedom was right and forward-looking. Michael Howard's denunciation of 'unparalleled evil', on hearing that his unlawful, ill-judged 15-year tariff had been so flouted, offered only a timewarped echo of the trial judge's summary of long ago. Even so, Howard may have struck a chord beyond the auxiliary prosecutors of the lynch mob.</p> <p>We are, deep down, happier with the concept of evil than redemption. Wickedness, whether bred-in-the-bone or a contagion affecting the troubled and deprived, is a convenient, catch-all notion that masks any need to excavate the inexplicable. The sinister bond that drives 10-year-old boys to murder is not amenable to rational deconstruction. And so we lump them in with a gallery of the tainted, from Pol Pot to Mary Bell, grateful that we, and our children, are immune to such poison.</p> <p>Redemption is harder to take. When Bell, the killer of two small boys, was tracked down in the wake of Gitta Sereny's biography, few applauded the fact that she, the mother of a teenage daughter, had flourished. Instead, newspaper accounts of her life bore undertones of freakishness. Any suggestion that Bell had a predilection for cat-strangling would have provoked less of a frisson of disgust than her supposed 'gentleness' and wish to work with children.</p> <p>Yet she is the matrix for rehabilitation. A damaged child, Bell was sexually abused by staff and inmates of her special unit before finally emerging to as normal a life as is feasible for anyone pursued by journalists, biographers and all the ghosts of the past. How much better the chances of Thompson and Venables must be. Still there was a rancorous subtext to last week's reports of young men supposedly grown plump on food parcels supplied by caring parents and lavished with the best the state can offer.</p> <p>Heavens, they even have access to television and a pool table before the key turns in the lock at night. What sort of punishment is that? No sort at all, according to Denise Fergus, whose tragedy gives her the unassailable, understandable right to rail against clemency (and, on a minor point, against the newspapers who caricatured her as the weeping victim of last week's ruling. In fact, she endured the ordeal with absolute dignity and composure).</p> <p>But logic, justice and economics decree that Lord Woolf is also right to spare Thompson and Venables 'corrosive' and drug-ridden young offender institutions that would unravel all progress. I would guess that his dig at youth jails was calculated to reverberate far beyond the Bulger case. When I recently discussed prisons with him, he, a notable reformer, described over-crowding as 'the cancer at the heart of the system'.</p> <p>This year, the number of under-17s in jail rose 11 per cent to 2,929. Two months ago, Kevin Henson, aged 17, hanged himself from a pipe in Feltham Young Offenders Institution and became the latest in a litany of similar victims: Zahid Mabarek, battered to death as his parents organised the party for his imminent release; Lee Waite, who committed suicide after a brutal assault by other inmates; Jeffrey Horler, aged 15, who took his life in a Feltham cell 200 miles from his Norfolk home.</p> <p>A dozen teenagers have killed themselves this year in British prisons, crammed with society's Untermenschen: the knife-carriers, the pilferers of car radios and, once Jack Straw's new legislation kicks in, those twice in contravention of community service orders. Only the intervention of Lord Woolf and others prevented the last category being mandatorily siphoned into institutions geared to recycling rather than redeeming young offenders.</p> <p>Who speaks for those children? Most vocally, Sir David Ramsbotham, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, who has twice castigated 'the disgraceful treatment and appalling conditions' at Feltham and lambasted woeful rehabilitation elsewhere. In one prison, he found young men idly crayoning in children's colouring books because there was nothing else to do. Exactly a year has passed since Ramsbotham blotted his own copybook.</p> <p>What he told me during an interview exactly presaged Lord Woolf's conclusion that the Bulger killers should be freed as soon as possible. 'I should not wish them to go to some of the institutions I have seen,' Ramsbotham said. For this, he was forced publicly to apologise by the Home Secretary. It was decided shortly afterwards that his inspectorate would be swallowed up in a new body covering prisons and probation. The suspicion is that Ramsbotham's outspokenness and harrumphing exposures of hideous jail conditions had become too irksome for his political masters to bear.</p> <p>His likely departure is to be deplored, especially in a climate in which many wish the Bulger killers had got their fix of suffering from a penal system admirably equipped to supply it. Such atavistic attitudes imply, under the kindest interpretation, an Augustinian line on salvation. Redeem them, Lord, but not quite yet. Hence the value of Lord Woolf, whose creed of redemption is already well-aired. Two weeks ago, he hinted to me that Myra Hindley might also hope for freedom. Such an outcome would provoke an uproar beside which last week's reprise of resurrected evils would look mild.</p> <p>But the scandal hinges not on those we let out of jail but on those whom we keep in. Of course, we should remember, as they always will, how brutally Thompson and Venables extinguished an innocent life. Other images, less reminiscent of immutable evil, also linger. 'Can I go home now?' one of the boys asked childishly during the trial. The answer, eight years down the line, is yes. Applaud its humanity and reserve the fury for the fate of those in Feltham and elsewhere who will never have their homecoming.</p>",
  "Billy McIntyre tried to stick to his routine on Wednesday night. At about 7pm he left his terraced house on a quiet estate in the north of Aberdeen and made the 10-minute journey up the hill to the city's royal infirmary. <p>For an hour and a half he sat with his daughter Donna, aged 21, who has been in hospital since being diagnosed with new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in September. As usual, he chatted with her, tickled her, and tousled her hair to keep her animated. </p> <p>When he returned home he could not stomach the thought of dinner. He made do with a cup of tea, and tried to concentrate on the television. At 8am the next day, McIntyre rose, washed and dressed before going into the kitchen for some breakfast. He turned on the radio and waited. It was a long, slow morning. At 12.32pm, Nick Brown, the agriculture secretary, rose to announce publication of the public inquiry into Britain's BSE epidemic. </p> <p>'I was emotional all the way through the announcement,' McIntyre said. 'I was crying a lot. Some of that was relief that the answers were coming out. But mainly it was anger because the report was so damning. I'm not going to congratulate ministers on this report because the whole thing should never have been allowed to happen. I don't even accept their apology.' McIntyre's daughter will be dead in months. </p> <p>David Bee had never seen anything like it. The cow was arching its back, waving its head from side to side. It was pitifully thin. His colleague, Mike Teale, had told him of being chased by a similarly afflicted beast which had 'chased him across the box on her knees'. </p> <p>It was three days before Christmas, 1984. Bee, a well-known local vet, had been called to Pitsham Farm on the South Downs by its owner, Peter Stent. Stent was worried. One of his cows was ill. He had no idea what it was. </p> <p>When Bee arrived, he was not sure what to think. Maybe there was a local problem with mercury poisoning Stent's herd. Maybe it was a kidney disease. Nobody knew then, but Stent's sick animal would soon become famous as 'Cow 133'. In the heart of farming country, Bee was staring into the eyes of a disaster. </p> <p>He never expected a walk-on part in the story of Britain's biggest public health scandal. Most of the locals knew him as an enthusiastic 'joiner-in' at church in his picturesque village of West Liss. His bright tone made him a favourite when it came to reading out passages from the Bible. </p> <p>Cow 133 was the first case of BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Sixteen years and sixteen volumes of public inquiry later, the Government stands accused of failing the public. Bureaucracy, caution and secrecy has led, slowly and painfully, to the realisation that the structures in place to protect the people had simply not worked. </p> <p>Last week, Lord Phillips' report into how a disease in cows became a tragedy for humans shone a light into the deepest recesses of government operation. Debate so far has focused on the surface story, the missed opportunities and confused messages which allowed an ugly sore to fester. </p> <p>That story was contained in Volume 1 of Lord Phillips' inquiry. But there are 15 other volumes, thousands of pages of memos and secret deals, legal challenges and stand-up rows that reveal how government really works - and not always work in the public's interest. Not since the Scott inquiry into the Arms to Iraq affair has Britain seen such a damning indictment of its public 'servants'. </p> <p>Carol Richardson had just returned from holiday in September 1995. A pathologist at the government's Central Veterinary Laboratory, she was asked to study the brain of an adult cow from Pitsham Farm, one that Bee had seen. After looking at slides of the brain she confirmed that it showed characteristics of a 'spongiform encephalopathy', BSE. It was the start. </p> <p>Richardson sought a second opinion from a colleague, Dr Martin Jeffrey. She left the slides on his work bench in the laboratory and went to lunch. On her return, Jeffrey had left a note by one of the slides. 'Bovine scrapie' he wrote, referring to the BSE-type disease common in sheep. </p> <p>Richardson's boss, Gerald Wells, was at a meeting in Cheshire when she made her astonishing finding. On his return he read the report. 'I agreed with her,' he said simply. The following April further evidence emerged from a farm in Kent. Something big was happening. </p> <p>How should the Government vets deal with it? The head of pathology department at the CVL was Ray Bradley. With initial results showing that a new, potentially fatal, disease had been discovered, the initial policy was clear. Bradley sent a memo to Dr William Watson, CVL director, and Dr Brian Shreeve, director of research. This is what it said: </p> <p>'If the disease turned out to be bovine scrapie it would have severe repercussions to the export trade and possibly also for humans if for example it was discovered that humans with spongiform encephalopathies had close association with cattle. It is for these reasons that I have classified this document confidential. At present I would recommend playing it low key.' </p> <p>New cases kept dribbling in. It was suggested that information should be passed around, the usual method when new scientific discoveries are made. The veterinary journals - Vision, the in-house magazine for the Government's veterinary service, and Veterinary Record - were suggested as forums for this exhange. But permission was withdrawn. Plans to give information to universities and outside research bodies were also blocked. </p> <p>Why? By getting the information out in the public domain, there would be a greater chance of understanding what the vets were dealing with and of estimating how widespread the problem was. The reasoning by the officials was clear. 'Because of the nature of the disorder, its political implications and possible effects on exports,' said Dr Bernard Williams, head of the Government's veterinary investigation service. Cards would be played very close to the chest. </p> <p>By the end of May 1987, with Margaret Thatcher's third election victory a matter of weeks away, there were six positive cases of BSE and 13 suspected cases. It was well over two years since Bee had first set eyes on Cow 133. The problem was growing. Ministers had still not been told. </p> <p>On June 1, William Rees, the chief veterinary officer and as such one of the most powerful men in the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, wrote to Donald Thompson, MAFF's parliamentary secretary, about BSE. </p> <p>'Irresponsible or ill-informed publicity is likely to be unhelpful since it might lead to hysterical demands for immediate, draconian government measures and could lead to a rejection of UK exports,' he said. </p> <p>'It does not seem appropriate at this stage for MAFF to issue general information. The political implication are serious, particularly if not handled correctly.' </p> <p>That line became the leitmotif of the Government's response to an approaching storm. Economics were the main concern and the farming industry needed to be protected. People could be easily alarmed, the civil service thought. Better secrecy than public hysteria. By the end of August, 1987, 46 more probable cases of BSE had been identified. By the middle of September it was 73. By the end of October, 120. Farming newspapers published the first articles about an 'incurable disease wiping out dairy cows'. By the end of November, there were 243 suspected cases. </p> <p>The public were oblivious to the danger. Richard Sibley, chairman of the British Cattle Veterinary Association, said: 'Throughout most of 1986 and 1987 most veterinary surgeons who were in the front line of disease diagnosis and control were ignorant of the presence of this disease and were not informed of its clinical signs or its significance as a potential national disease problem.' </p> <p>By the end of March 1988, 600 probable cases of BSE had been reported. The Government's mind was made up: scrapie in sheep had never jumped species to man, despite being known about for 200 years. BSE wouldn't either. </p> <p>As usual, John MacGregor's red box of weekend reading was overflowing. It was February 1988 and the secretary of state for agriculture had a two busy days of meetings and business ahead. </p> <p>In his ministerial papers was a document from John Suich of MAFF's animal health division. The BSE problem was becoming serious, numbers were rising alarmingly. Suich suggested that a slaughter compensation scheme should be agreed for farmers, who were increasing disquiet about a disaster developing in their midst. </p> <p>Two months earlier, MacGregor had received a letter from Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, a landowner. 'There is nothing which prevents veterinary officers from certifying the carcass of an animal infected with this disease as fit for human consumption. I understand little research has been done on whether this disease can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of beef from infected animals. Until this is known it seems quite wrong to sell infected carcasses for this purpose.' It was the first time the public health link had been made. </p> <p>Suich's memo to MacGregor tackled the issue. 'I would be reluctant to say the risk [to human health] is negligible. One theory is that BSE may have originated from sheep affected with scrapie. If this theory is correct we have to face up to the possibility that the disease could cross another species gap.' </p> <p>This view would not be made public for another eight years. MAFF considered it too dangerous for the multi-billion pound farming industry. </p> <p>MacGregor read Suich's comments on the slaughter and compensation deal. In the margins, more as an aide-m\u00e9moire than anything else, he noted that there was a need for caution. How much would a slaughter and compensation scheme cost? Would analogies be made with other farming problems, such as rhizomania in sugar beet which was devastating crops, leaving the Government open to heavy compensation claims? Treasury was unlikely to agree to funding the scheme if there was no evidence that there was a risk to human health. For MacGregor, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, economics were of primary concern. </p> <p>MAFF officials took this to mean that the scheme was off the agenda. In a letter to the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Donald Acheson, they failed to make it clear that they urgently wanted a slaughter and compensation scheme. They simply said they wanted Acheson's thoughts on the possible health implications of BSE. Acheson himself confessed that he felt irritated at the incredibly short notice he had been given to come up with such an important opinion. </p> <p>'To be, off the cuff, asking the CMO, at a moment's notice, personally to give advice to take diseased cattle out of the food chain is a gross misunderstanding of the nature of the job,' Acheson later told the inquiry. </p> <p>His feelings were nothing compared with Dr Hilary Pickles, the principal medical officer at the Department of Health. How, she asked, was the department supposed to fulfil its role when MAFF didn't keep them informed? </p> <p>'The most serious delay was in informing DH in the first place,' she said. 'The Central Veterinary Laboratory were aware of a new disease in January 1987, they informed their ministers in June 1987 but wrote to us only on 3 March 1988, by which time they had 500 cases.' Pickles was furious. Inter-departmental jealousies meant that MAFF wanted to keep BSE within its sphere of influence. </p> <p>The civil service had fallen into what is known along the corridors of Whitehall as 'shaded-opinion'. When officials feel they know the mind of the minister, all options are couched in terms that the minister is likely to agree to. MAFF officials didn't tell Acheson of their own feelings on the issue of compensation because they thought MacGregor's mind was made up. It wasn't. </p> <p>'I am a little surprised to find significance attached to things which were an aide-m\u00e9moire to me,' MacGregor said later of his notes scribbled in the margins. On such misunderstandings are problems built. It was another five months of delay and circulating memos before the slaughter scheme was finally agreed. In that time hundreds of infected carcasses had entered the food chain. </p> <p>With Acheson and Pickles' opinions clear, Bradley knew pressure was growing on MAFF to give information more widely to the medical profession. In September 1987 he dropped a note to Watson suggesting publishing an article about BSE in the medical journal the Lancet. 'There are of course pros and cons,' Bradley said. 'What do you think?' </p> <p>Watson replied. 'Not at present. It would over-emphasise the possible link to human spongiform encephalopathies.' So the public remained ignorant. </p> <p>MAFF were determined to hold the line that beef was perfectly safe to eat. A week after Bradley's Lancet request, Rees knew that '[the DoH] are aware of the problem and have informally expressed some concern about any possible human health risks,' he wrote in a progress report to MacGregor. But less than a month later, Suich circulated this memo to press officers in case they had to answer questions on BSE. </p> <p>'Q: Can it be transmitted to humans?' </p> <p>'A: There is no evidence that it is transmissable to humans.' </p> <p>There was no evidence, but there were concerns. It was MAFF's policy not to reveal them. </p> <p>A cow's death is seldom pretty. In the Eighties most of Britain's 1,000 abbatoirs had adopted a 'production-line' system for killing, blood-letting and cutting up cows. </p> <p>Beasts ready for slaughter would arrive at a holding area. They would be lined up between metal fences, single file, and fed into a pen. A bolt would be fired into the animal's brain, followed by a pithing rod, a pronged instrument which would cause further damage to the brain and spinal cord to stop the animal kicking. Hoisted up by the hind legs, the cow's neck would be slit, the head cut off and the offal removed. Meat would then be processed in one direction, and the mass of guts and blood would go to a different department. Everything was used for either animal or human consumption. </p> <p>In October 1992, John Gummer, then the secretary of state for agriculture, was called before the agriculture select committee. Sitting before them in the House of Commons, Gummer was asked about hygiene standards for killing cattle. Reading from reports from environmental officers charged with inspecting slaughter houses, Gummer said: </p> <p>'We have real problems with our slaughter houses.' He turned to one of the officer's reports. 'Slaughter hall floor heavily soiled with blood, gut contents and other debris - no attempt to clean up between carcasses. Car cleaning brush heavily contaminated with blood and fat being used to wash carcasses. Offal rack and carcass rails encrusted with dirt. Missing windows - birds, flies and vermin entering. Effluent discharging across floor - risk of contamination.' Faeces was often found smeared over the dead bodies of the cows. </p> <p>A year earlier, Gummer had warned Prime Minister John Major that 60 per cent of slaughter houses did not meet European standards. </p> <p>It mattered. In November 1989, the Government had ordered that brains and spinal cords of cows should be prevented from entering the human food chain. Brain and spinal cord were thought to contain the infective BSE material. It became known as the specific bovine offal ban. </p> <p>The removal of the spinal cord was a tricky business. Cows had to be sawn neatly in two. The safety of the public was dependent on men with knives with electric saws and stun guns, killing and cutting up cows in chaotic conditions. There was widespread evidence that remains of spinal cords were entering the food chain, in reports given to MAFF and the DoH in 1995. </p> <p>'We asked MAFF officials whether evidence of poor hygiene standards in slaughter houses did not raise concerns about the standard of enforcement of the duty to remove the spinal cord from the carcass,' Lord Phillips said. 'Each replied that it did not.' </p> <p>Even with the evidence that the slaughter house system was filthy, MAFF and the department of healt stuck to the line that beef was perfectly safe to eat. </p> <p>On a warm pring evening in May 1990, Gerald Wells received a telephone call. It was the chief veterinary officer, Keith Meldrum. Wells, a senior member of the Central Veterinary Laboratory, was asked about his discovery of a BSE-type disease in a cat in Bristol. </p> <p>Wells said that it had 'profound implications' for the Government's line on BSE's possible effects on people. Other experts argued that if a cat had 'caught' BSE, probably from eating infected offal crushed up in pet food, people could be next. Meldrum held a meeting with Gummer at which they agreed that the Government had to hold the line. They said there was 'no likely connection' between the cat and BSE. Such stubbornness was to continue for another six years. </p> <p>Over the next three years, finding after finding undermined the foundations of the Government's policy. And every time, the Government sort to shore up its own rickety structure with assurances that beef was completely safe. </p> <p>In August 1990 scientists successfully transferred BSE to a pig. In March 1993 the Lancet reported that the first dairy farmer had died CJD, the human equivalent of BSE. That month Kenneth Calman, the chief medical officer, issued a statement saying that beef was safe to eat. </p> <p>'Dr Calman was seeking to address fears that a farmer had somehow caught BSE from his cattle,' the Phillips report says. 'Responding to such fears by emphasising that it was safe to eat beef naturally carried the inference that transmission of the disease from cow to human was impossible. </p> <p>'Dr Calman should have been careful not to suggest such a belief, for he considered that there was a real potential for BSE to move from cows to humans.' </p> <p>Then came Vicky Rimmer. Early in summer 1993 she fell ill with a degenerative disease which mystified her doctors. By mid-September she was blind and had fallen into a coma. She would become another fatal CJD statistic. </p> <p>On 26 January, 1994, press reporting of Vicky's case was causing alarm. Calman was again pressed into action with the encouragement of MAFF and made another reassuring statement. 'On the basis of the work done so far there is not the slightest evidence that eating beef or hamburgers caused CJD,' he said. Phillips said that the strength with which Calman made the point was 'somewhat more emphatic than desirable'. </p> <p>Why was Calman wheeled out so regularly? A briefing paper from Douglas Hogg, the secretary of state for agriculture in 1995, to Major reveals the thinking. 'The Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Veterinary Officer ought to be by far the most convincing spokesmen for the Government on the question of whether BSE could be transmitted to humans from infected meat.' Politicians weren't trusted, so Britain's faith in experts had to be tested to the limit. </p> <p>In the second half of 1995, two more dairy farmers died of CJD, bringing the total to four. The committee of experts brought together by the Government to advise them on BSE and CJD said they were now looking at something greater than a chance phenomenon. One official suggested that maybe the farmers had eaten the infected cattle feed they were giving to their herds. Holding the line was getting difficult. </p> <p>Another blow came. Two more teenagers had been diagnosed with CJD. The media smelt scandal. Confidence had to be rebuilt, ministers had to go on the attack. </p> <p>In December, Stephen Dorrell, the health secretary, appeared on Jonathan Dimbleby's ITV political programme on ITV to do just that. </p> <p>'So there is no conceivable risk from what is now in the food chain?' Dimbleby asked. Dorrell thought about his reply carefully, mindful that a word out of place could bring the Government's policy down around his ears. 'That is the position,' he said. Dorrell admitted later that his words 'had gone too far'. </p> <p>Hogg was worried. Public confidence in beef was taking a battering. He demanded a campaign to convince the public that eating beef was safe. He asked the scientific committee of advisers, supposedly independent, to answer a series of questions. 'This was not because he wished to know the answers,' Lord Phillips said. 'It was in the hope that the answers would be suitable to publish in order to give reassurance to those who are worried about the safety of eating beef.' </p> <p>Colin MacLean, the director general of the Meat and Livestock Commission, wrote to one of the committee, Dr Richard Kimberlin. </p> <p>'We agree that we need succinct answers to these questions and my colleagues in our PR company have drafted the sort of answers they would like to see (although they cannot put words into [the committee's] mouth!).' </p> <p>The MLC is charged with promoting beef in Britain. Kimberlin, a government adviser, was also a paid consultant for the MLC. Phillips says of MacLean's reassuring words on the safety of eating beef that 'hyperbole had replaced accuracy'. </p> <p>The rows were beginning. As more and more cases of CJD appeared, the DoH was getting increasingly nervous. But to keep the beef industry and exports from collapse MAFF ploughed on. </p> <p>By the end of February 1996, just a month before Hogg had to get up in the Commons and announce a link between BSE and a new form of CJD in people, MAFF prepared a leaflet to reassure the public. On the front page it stated: 'Two facts should be made absolutely clear. Fact 1: there is currently no scientific evidence to indicate a link between BSE and CJD. Fact 2: the independent expert committee set up to advise the Government on all aspects of BSE is satisfied that British beef is safe to eat.' </p> <p>Dr Ailsa Wight, a department of health expert on BSE, was shown the leaflet and was asked whether the DoH might like to jointly issue it with MAFF. Wight passed the request on to Dr Jeremy Metters, the deputy chief medical officer. He was furious. </p> <p>'Some statements are too definite and in time may be seen to be wrong,' he wrote in a memo to Wight. 'We should not follow MAFF's hyperbole of reassurance. We must leave ministers and CMO in particular an escape route if any of these statements turns out to be WRONG.' </p> <p>As the inter-departmental battles intensified, the number of young people catching CJD was increasing. Dr Robert Will, the leading expert in CJD from the Government supported CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, had depressing news. These cases of CJD were unlike any other. There was something going on. </p> <p>On a damp evening early in March, 1996, Richard Packer, the permanent secretary at MAFF, walked into Hogg's cavernous office on the corner of Smith Square in Westminster. It was late, but Packer had some bad news. 'There is a very dark cloud on the horizon,' he told Hogg. 'SEAC [the Government advisory committee] think, or are coming to the view, that BSE might be transmissible.' </p> <p>Hogg paused as the import of what Packer was saying sunk in. 'This is a very serious state of affairs,' he said. </p> <p>Calman was told. Meldrum was told. Beef was not safe. Hogg prepared to make a statement to Parliament as soon as possible. If this leaked out, the Government would be finished. It was agreed that Dorrell would make the first statement and Hogg would follow. For the first time in the whole disaster, the considerations of the DoH were put ahead of those of MAFF. </p> <p>On 20 March, at 3.31pm, Dorrell rose from the green Government benches in the Commons chamber. He said that a new form of CJD had been discovered and that, despite there being no firm scientific evidence that it had come from eating beef, SEAC concluded that the cases were linked to eating infected meat in the Eighties. </p> <p>At 4.17pm, Hogg made his statement, saying that all cattle over 30 months would be slaughtered. In that one day billions of pounds were wiped off the value of Britain's beef industry. Incinerators worked night and day burning cattle. Pictures of bovine funeral pyres led the news day after day as hundreds of herds were burnt. Farmers were ruined. Many have never recovered. </p> <p>The Government had finally been caught out. From day one, convinced by the theory that scrapie had never been transmitted to man from sheep, and that therefore BSE could not be transmitted either, they drew a line in the sand and refused to cross it. Even when the scrapie theory was proved wrong - BSE actually came from a genetic mutation in cattle in the Seventies and was passed on by feeding cow remains to herds as animal feed - they refused to budge. </p> <p>Economics guided them. The public could not be trusted to make up their own mind. Science found it impossible to prove a link, so there was always an opportunity for more research. More delay and more reassuring noises. </p> <p>Eventually the weight of evidence overwhelmed the Government's defences. But even at the very last, there were those arguing that a cattle cull could be 'disproportionately expensive' given the number of cases of CJD (then 10). These were men trying to bale out out the Titanic with a teaspoon. </p> <p>Sixty miles away, David Bee must have greeted the news with horror. On a cold Christmas in 1984 he had created the first ripple of a gathering storm which eventually engulfed the nation. And in Aberdeen, Billy McIntyre still makes the 10 minute journey to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to tousle his daughter's hair. Anything to keep her happy until she dies from a disease that started in cattle and is now eating her brain. </p> <p><b>The key unanswered questions</b></p> <p><b>Why does vCJD predominantly affect young people?</b> </p> <p>A possible explanation is the disproportionate consumption by young people of beefburgers, some of which contain high-risk material. There is also a higher incidence of affections such as tonsilitis or gastroenteritis in children giving rise to transmission through broken skin or mucous membranes; and transmission via childhood vaccines prepared in cultures containing bovine constituents. </p> <p><b>How many more people will succumb to vCJD?</b> </p> <p>Estimates of the size of an epidemic are made difficult by the many unknowns. Scientists do not know enough about dose, route of exposure, incubation period, genetic susceptibility and scale of the species barrier between cattle and humans. Latest estimates range from a few hundred to just over 130,000. </p> <p><b>What was the origin of BSE?</b> </p> <p>Lord Phillips believe we may never know for certain how and why BSE first appeared. The best guess is that a sporadic form of the disease probably occurred in the 1970s through some type of freak genetic dysfunction. The epidemic happened because remains of individual diseased cattle were ground up and fed back to healthy animals. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><br><a href=\"http://www.bse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bsereview.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Food Standards Agency BSE Review</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">MAFF BSE site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cjd\" target=\"_NEW\">Department of Health BSE/CJD site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.humanbse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Human BSE Foundation - voluntary support group</a><br> <a href=\"http://sparc.airtime.co.uk/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE news and research</a></p>",
  "Tout - the word used to describe informers in Northern Ireland - is no longer politically correct. The chilling IRA warning 'touts will be shot' will have to be erased from the walls of Belfast and Derry and replaced with 'Chis's will be shot'. <p>For police officers can no longer call their sources inside the IRA and loyalist terror groups informers or 'touts' thanks to the new Human Rights Act. </p> <p>Under legislation introduced to cope with the impact of the Act, agents are now to be known as 'Covert Human Intelligence Sources', or 'Chis's'. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act was brought in this month to regulate the use of informers or Chis's in response to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights dealing with the right to privacy. </p> <p>For the first time the use of all Chis's past and present will be scrutinised by government-appointed commissioners throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland, most of whom are serving or former members of the judiciary. </p> <p>In Northern Ireland the former Lord Chief Justice, John MacDermott, will oversee the work of police, army and MI5 agents in the Province. </p> <p>A senior RUC source told The Observer the new legislation would slow down the process of recruiting and running Chis's in terrorist groups. </p> <p>'Everybody we work with on a secret basis will have to be human-rights proofed,' he said. 'It will mean a lot more scrutiny of the worth of each agent or Chis. We will be asked to prove that by approaching a potential agent we are not infringing his human rights. We will even have to prove that we are recruiting people in order to prevent specific crimes from taking place.' </p> <p>The officer added: 'What this Act does is to give the police a legal framework to test the validity of their sources, because there are going to be challenges under the human rights legislation to find out if we got information on a suspect from an agent - sorry, I should have said Chis.' </p> <p>The Act also empowers the commissioners to impose limits on the use of human and electronic surveillance of terrorist and criminal suspects. The use of informers and surveillance by the RUC and M15 was crucial in ending the IRA's 25-year campaign of terror in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The price for informing on either loyalist or republican terror groups has always been a high one, normally a bullet in the back of the head after hours, sometimes days, of brutal interrogation. </p> <p>The body set up to defend human rights in Northern Ireland said the Act regulating the use of informants and surveillance was 'laudable in principle but flawed on the details'. </p> <p>Brice Dickson, the chairman of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, said: 'It's unclear if [MacDermott] is able to investigate every aspect of covert intelligence or whether he can only oversee this when there is a complaint made. It is important he retains absolute independence and has blanket powers of scrutiny.'</p>",
  "Tony Blair is off the hook. The Countryside Alliance says Margaret Thatcher was the real reason for rural revolt and the rise of the powerful pro-hunting lobby. <p>That might come as surprising news to many of the 390,000 generally Tory-leaning members of the Alliance who plan to march on London next March. But Alliance chairman John Jackson has no doubts. It was Thatcher's years in power that truly spelled trouble for country folk. </p> <p>In an interview with The Observer, Jackson slammed Thatcher's famous 1987 declaration that 'there is no such thing as society'. He said its city-based bias led, 10 years later, to the founding of the Alliance. </p> <p>'Her conception of a Great Britain that was made up of millions of individuals was totally unsound. It fitted very badly with the countryside which is based on many communities, each in its own way a society,' he said. </p> <p>'When she said there was no such thing as society she was making a statement from an urban mindset and it did not ring at all well in the countryside.' </p> <p>Jackson even has harsh words for Thatcher's treatment of the mining industry, hardly a natural ally of the hunting, shooting and fishing brigade. 'The Thatcher government failed to take any remedial action to help the large number of villages dependent on the mining industry,' he said. </p> <p>He said that during the Eighties the Tory Party betrayed its heartlands by assuming - largely correctly - that rural voters would never vote for any one else. 'In a way it was our own fault, country people were being taken for granted,' he said. </p> <p>Jackson leads one of the largest political phenomenons of recent years. The Alliance was formed from three groups, including the British Field Sports Society, to protect fox hunting. Though horses and hounds remain key to its agenda, its interests now stretch to fighting the closure of rural post offices and a campaign for a department of rural affairs. It now has 80 full-time staff, including 10 press officers, and an annual budget of \u00a34.5 million. </p> <p>The organisation, heavy with country toffs and blue-rinse Tories, has clashed repeatedly with New Labour. At Labour's recent conference in Brighton Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott told delegates: 'Every time I see the contorted faces of the Countryside Alliance, I redouble my determination to vote to abolish fox hunting for ever.' </p> <p>Those comments infuriated Jackson, who says he has never hunted in his life and is a member of the Fabian Society. However, some Alliance members deserve their reputation. At the Labour conference, one protester was dressed as Tony Blair with a noose around his neck. A poster bearing the Alliance logo said the gay agriculture minister Nick Brown 'loves gays, but buggers the countryside'. </p> <p>Behind the bitterness, Jackson believes, is the British countryside's worst crisis. His village of Aynho in Northamptonshire, has lost its post office, school and shop in the past decade. </p> <p>He believes huge swathes of the countryside could soon lie derelict. 'In another ten years it will be too late. Villages will just turn into weekend dormitories for the nearest big city,' he said. <br><br><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.countryside-alliance.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.countryside-alliance.org</a> <br>News and information on rural issues</p>",
  "On paper he sounds like one of the most eligible single men in the UK. <p>He doesn't drink, smoke or take drugs, is a published author and a veritable charmer who by the end of the year will be \u00a3200,000 better off. </p> <p>There is just one catch. Martin McGartland is an IRA informer who, after surviving two murder attempts, admits he will be looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life. </p> <p>The botched attempt on McGartland's life in Whitley Bay, Tyne &amp; Wear, 18 months ago has turned out to be one of the most lucrative bungled assassinations in Irish or British history. </p> <p>Legal sources close to the former IRA volunteer-turned-police-agent have told The Observer he is likely to net more than \u00a3200,000 due to a raft of inaccurate reports immediately following the attempted murder on 17 June last year. </p> <p>The 30-year-old west Belfast man, now living under a new identity in England, has successfully sued a range of Irish and British newspapers. They reported at the time of the shooting that he was targeted by a North-east England drugs gang with which he was in dispute rather than his old IRA comrades. </p> <p>So far McGartland, who was regarded as one of the RUC's most important agents inside the IRA's Belfast Brigade during the early Nineties, has sued the Daily Mail , Independent , Financial Times, Daily Record, London Evening Standard, Irish Independent and Irish Sunday Independent . Several of the papers have been forced to publish apologies over their allegations linking him to drugs gangs, and a number have paid large out-of-court settlements to a fugitive who just 10 months ago was living in a police cell in Northumbria. </p> <p>Several months after the murder bid it emerged that the RUC uncovered a ballistics link between the gun used to shoot McGartland and the weapon that killed Brendan 'Speedy' Fegan in Newry, Co Down last year. The IRA murdered Fegan, a bejewelled, bon viveur drugs baron who defied republican threats in the Irish border town. </p> <p>Speaking from a secret location in England yesterday, McGartland said he was perplexed over what to do with his libel windfall. He refuses to discuss the exact amount he has taken from newspapers. </p> <p>'I wanted to put the record straight about who tried to kill me. Anybody in the know should have realised that the IRA was behind the murder attempt. Yet some of the journalists I used to get information for about other people back in Belfast were the very ones who wrote this nonsense about drug gangs being responsible. I've never smoked or drank in my life, let alone taken drugs or been associated with people dealing drugs.' </p> <p>McGartland said there was a conspiracy to cover up the fact that the IRA tried to kill him, particularly with the peace process reaching a critical stage back home in Northern Ireland. The British Government, he claimed, wanted to cover up IRA involvement and thus avoid having to judge that the ceasefire was broken. </p> <p>'I first learnt about these allegations in my hospital bed and it just made things worse for me. I had taken five bullets and had two fingers of my left hand shot off and here were people in the media I used to talk to peddling this line which was just a load of propaganda,' he said. </p> <p>The former IRA man was left fighting for his life after two gunmen opened fire on him outside his home in Whitley Bay where he was well-known in the local community as a fugitive informer on the run from the Provos. McGartland astonished doctors by making a miraculous recovery and has since moved out of the area. They put his survival down to his fitness, strength and healthy lifestyle. </p> <p>Despite his newly acquired wealth, the IRA informer who betrayed scores of terrorist operations in Belfast insisted he would not be leading the life of champagne Charlie. </p> <p>'Martin McGartland's not just about to jet off to some tropical island, that's not my scene. I'm a UK man and I intend to stay here although I have to say I'm not coming back to Northern Ireland in a hurry. I haven't given a thought about what to do with the money yet. I can't even buy a fast car now because I can't drive since I had the fingers shot off. God knows what I'll do with the money.' </p> <p>McGartland was a petty criminal who infiltrated the IRA for the RUC Special Branch and is believed to have saved dozens of lives. Codenamed 'Carol' he compromised several major IRA opera tions including an attempt to massacre British soldiers drinking off-duty in a bar in the Co Down seaside resort of Bangor in 1991. Shortly afterwards McGartland was abducted by the IRA's internal security squad in a west Belfast Sinn Fein advice centre. He was taken to a house in the Twinbrook where he was to be interrogated and then shot. But McGartland managed to break free of his captors, throw himself out of an upstairs bathroom window and was ferried to hospital in an ambulance. He was later spirited out of Northern Ireland by his RUC handlers. </p> <p>He later wrote a best-selling account of his time in the IRA called Fifty Dead Men Walking and a sequel on life after he was unmasked as an informer titled Dead Man Running . </p> <p>'The money means nothing to me compared to my health. I've had four operations since I was shot last year and there is one more to go within the next few months. To be honest I would swap the money tomorrow if I could be in rude health again,' McGartland added.</p>",
  "\u0095 Lieutenant Colonel Nigel Wylde is an unlikely subversive - a Sandhurst education and radical dissent don't mix. Until 1997 he was just a brave soldier who received the Queen's Medal for Gallantry after testing his nerve and risking his life defusing bombs in Northern Ireland. His friends tell me that he has not aged into a Blimpish bore who boasts of his exploits to a weary audience. They describe a convivial and self-deprecating man who conforms rather well to the English ideal of a gentleman officer. <p>His distinguished record has not saved him from becoming the latest victim of a series of peculiar official secrecy trials which has lengthened as the threats from Moscow and Irish republicanism have diminished. Crossing the Ministry of Defence Police (Mod Plod to its detractors) dislocated what had been a conventional life and may yet bring ruin. He has lost his job. Colleagues of his wife, a teacher who has had nothing to do with the military, were interrogated and told that she too was a suspect. He is convinced that he is under surveillance. Wylde's last thoughts at night and first thoughts in the morning are: Why am I being prosecuted? Will I be convicted? He never imagined that he would be treated as a traitor by the forces he spent his youth serving. </p> <p>On 8 November the Crown Prosecution Service will tell Reading Crown Court that much of his hearing should be in camera. The accusation that he passed five secret documents to a journalist requires a sacrifice of the principle that secret justice is no justice at all. Wylde has denied all charges and it will be for the court to determine his guilt. While we wait for its verdict, the rest of us can wonder why on earth he is being dragged to the dock. Even by the absurd standards of recent political trials, the case of Regina versus Nigel Norman Wylde is surreal. </p> <p>The usual excuse for closing a court is that the evidence under examination is so sensitive that all means necessary must be deployed to stop it leaking. You are none the less perfectly free to read every one of the 'secrets' Wylde is alleged to have helped Tony Geraghty, a journalist and military affairs specialist, reveal in The Irish War , an account of the success and failure of the Army's campaign against the IRA. </p> <p>The pages the military appear to have taken exception to (158 to 164, book lovers should note) describe the use of computer systems for military surveillance. The exploding power of information technology to wipe out privacy by matching and cross-referring data collected by 'smart' cameras is the main theme. Like many writers before him, Geraghty warns that what is introduced as an emergency measure in Ulster can quickly become a standard means of surveillance of the rest of the British population. The past 30 years have been littered with examples of the exceptional becoming commonplace - the 'temporary' 1974 Prevention of Terrorism Act being the most blatant example. </p> <p>For all the fuss that has followed, the Attorney General did not seek an injunction to ban distribution of The Irish War . You can buy it today in any good bookshop. </p> <p>I recommend that you do, for Geraghty has done his work thoroughly. But I think he would be the first to admit that the discussion of information technology was not his most scintillating passage. The technology he described was old news when he published in 1998. </p> <p>A year earlier a careless intelligence officer had thrown aerial photographs of the homes of IRA suspects and papers describing Army surveillance into his dustbin. They were taken to a Belfast dump and spotted by an alert IRA sympathiser. He handed them to the Provisionals who ran highlights in Republican News . Sinn Fein complained that the Army had a crash programme to heighten its surveillance when na\u00efve republicans were assuming that peace and a relaxation of tensions were London's priorities. </p> <p>Geraghty had not revealed anything that the IRA did not know or put in its newspaper. Geraghty and HarperCollins, his publishers, were investigated nevertheless. They expected to be charged until the case against them was dropped in February. HarperCollins is a branch of the Murdoch empire with legions of corporate lawyers at its disposal. Geraghty is a freelance journalist and he and his wife, Gill, had a rough time of it while Mod Plod was proceeding with its inquiries. But they had the advantage of a wide circle of friends in the media, which extended well beyond the liberal press. Journalists across Fleet Street took up his cause and lambasted the authorities. Prosecution bore a political cost. </p> <p>Wylde had fewer allies. The criminal justice system is now after him for being the alleged source of a breach of the Official Secrets Act, while sparing the publisher and author who have received the royalties and profits from a book which remains on legal sale. Equality before the law has become something of a joke. </p> <p>Inevitably, conspiracy theories are being spun to explain capricious justice. The most plausible concentrate on Wylde's work as a computer consultant after he left the forces in 1991. He was a member of a team of eight specialists who audited the Army's computer and information systems in Northern Ireland in 1997. They were shambolic - 'the worst we have seen in our collective 133 years working in the IT area'. </p> <p>This conclusion probably did not endear Wylde to his former comrades. But I suspect it is a mistake to view his case in isolation. The past months have seen New Labour reach for the Official Secrets Act like an alcoholic diving for a whisky chaser. The Guardian and The Observer have been prosecuted for printing trivial information about David Shayler. The turbulent former spy has been charged himself and, as with Wylde, the law officers have insisted that his case must be heard in secret. Jawad Botmeh and Samar Alami, two Palestinians, are appealing against 20-year sentences for conspiring to blow up the Israeli Embassy. There are cogent doubts about the safety of their convictions, yet the Court of Appeal has ruled that the MI5 files which might save them must remain secret. </p> <p>The end of the Cold War and the uneasy truce in Ireland upset many interests. Secrecy, unaccountable government, public servility and the ability to cover up incompetence and official villainy were threatened by the removal of justifying 'threats'. </p> <p>An unwelcome peace requires official secrets cases to hold the line against demands that the public is now entitled to an honest account of what was done in its name during the twentieth century. A sharp message is being delivered to anyone thinking of speaking plainly. </p> <p>'Do you really want to be a Wylde or a Geraghty or a Shayler? Are you ready for the sleepless nights, the wrecked careers, the prison terms? Are your relatives ready? Even if you win in the end, will the years of trouble and expense have been worth it? Be a smart boy. Keep your head down and your big mouth shut.' </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Woodhead, the Chief Inspector of Schools and unelected Education Secretary, is a driven man. The trashing of his rivals by his court of pundits, the shrieking abuse of teachers, the driving of any student with self-respect away from a career in education are, we are told, all necessary to improve standards. Without him we would be lost souls in a dumb world. </p> <p>No one worried about standards can fail to be concerned by the performance of children from some of the ethnic minorities. Black, Pakistani and Bangladeshi pupils do far worse than their Indian and white contemporaries. The reasons for failure are, predictably, complicated - poverty, racism, working-class male cultures that regard academic success as unmanly are part of the mix - but the fact of failure cannot be denied. </p> <p>In July the Commission for Racial Equality found that references to race appeared in only 0.25 per cent of 10,000 reports on schools from Woodhead's inspectors. They seemed to wandering round the country stricken by colour blindness. Indifference to the strikingly obvious, of course, spared Woodhead the pain of being deemed 'politically correct' and a tool of the 'race relations industry' by his claque in the Tory press. Woodhead duly dismissed the CRE research as 'slender'. A private meeting with Gurbux Singh, the commission's mild chairman, was far nastier. The word 'ignoramus' was thrown around by a chief inspector who can give criticism but can't take it. </p> <p>Afterwards Singh wrote to Woodhead and said he was 'amazed and disappointed' by his 'personally insulting, patronising, rude and sanctimonious' behaviour. </p> <p>Copies of the correspondence are doing the rounds and will probably be put to Woodhead when he faces the Commons Education Committee this week. They have already made their way to David Blunkett, the elected Education Secretary, and Jack Straw, whose Home Office is responsible for implementing the Stephen Lawrence enquiry's recommendations on tackling institutional racism. They blew their tops and denounced Woodhead to 10 Downing Street. </p> <p>Their anger was telling. It revealed that a Labour Government's chief inspector is so far to the Right that he can achieve what many of us considered to be impossible and push Blunkett and Straw into behaving like pussy liberals.</p>",
  "With onl a bit over a week to go, Al Gore and George W. Bush are still neck and neck in the polls. This is the closest race since the Kennedy-Nixon election of 1960. But unlike that race, this one is something of a bore. Most Americans aren't very interested in who's to be the next leader of the world's most powerful nation. In 1960, most adult Americans turned out to vote. This time around, it's predicted that fewer than half will bother. The presidential election of 2000 will go down as one of the closest and most boring in American history. <p>The conventional Washington explanation for this is that there aren't any large issues facing America. Peace and prosperity have lured Americans into smug torpor. So the candidates' styles, smiles, sighs, smirks and quirks have become determinative. And by these trifling criteria, it's a toss up. Just wait, the pundits assure us: When the stakes are higher, we'll have a real election again. </p> <p>This is nonsense. America is not lacking large issues - among them, the incarceration of a record-shattering two million of our citizens, the expanding use of capital punishment here, the almost one in every five of American children still living in poverty, the unprecedented gap in income and wealth, the resegregation of the our schools, and the overwhelming dominance of money in American politics. There have been no large issues in this presidential campaign because the two major candidates and their handlers have avoided them. </p> <p>The closeness and dullness of this election is a consequence the strategies pursued by both sides. And it presages future American presidential elections that will be just as close and dull. </p> <p>From the start of the Bush and the Gore campaigns, both launched more than two years ago, the objective was clear: 'Forty percent are with us, 40 against, so we need to keep our base and take as much of the middle 20 as possible,' one consultant explained to me with the antiseptic certainty of an eye surgeon wielding a laser machine. </p> <p>Add to this that each campaign has been a marvel of technological wizardry. The candidates and their handlers have been able to discover exactly what voters think, what they want to hear, and what turns them off - even down to phrases and words, the style of clothing, the tilt of the head, the use of body, the intonation of the voice. Focus groups, dialometers, media labs, word labs, and mountains of bytes and bits of data have been analysed and econometricized. A mountain of money has been spent devising and airing advertisements cunningly tailored to particular groups of targeted voters in swing states. </p> <p>Some of this happened in past elections. But never with such sophisticated tools, with such an abundance of information backed by so much cash. The election of 2000 is the first major encounter between the digital economy and American politics. </p> <p>Bush and Gore also have been the most pliable of candidates, willing to try anything, say anything, do anything, wear anything that worked. Each followed the directions of his handlers and consultants to the letter. Each stayed on script, avoided risks, and experimented only within a narrow zone of safety in order to more precisely adjust the resonance to accomplish the mission. </p> <p>Bush's brand of 'compassionate conservatism', conveyed with wide-eyed smile and innocent shrug of the shoulders, is different in detail from Gore's 'practical idealism', expressed in stentorian tones and sweeping movements of the arms. But because the differences have been calculated to achieve the same end - keeping intact respective bases while claiming as much of the middle as possible - the positions and styles have inevitably converged. </p> <p>Gore's flirtation with old-fashioned American populism has been targeted at the big drug companies, HMOs and oil companies that most Americans distrust. Gore has not attacked corporate America in general, of which most Americans approve. Bush's attacks on big government have been discreetly aimed at the bureaucrats, red tape, and taxes that most Americans dislike. But has not taken on the vast complexes of the Pentagon, and the giant retirement programmes - Social Security and Medicare - all of which most Americans like. Bush and Gore have different schemes for reforming America's antiquated system of retirement security. But they're complicated, and they have been expressed in mind-dumbing trillions of dollars - eyes have glazed from Jersey City to Sacramento. </p> <p>As the campaign nears its close, both candidates have moved to the centre in pursuit of the 'swing' voters. Gore had condemned the easy access Americans have to guns and had called for strict gun controls. Now he avoids the mention of guns (Pennsylvania and Michigan are both toss-up states, and a lot of hunters reside in them). Months ago, Gore talked about 'working families'. Now he speaks mostly about 'middle-class families'. Early on, Bush railed against abortions. Now he stays away from this most controversial topic. </p> <p>Both men now agree on a host of things. Both say they're firmly behind a 'patients' bill of rights' which would require private providers of health care to meet minimum requirements. Both say they want to subsidise elderly Americans' access to costly prescription drugs. Both support free trade, a stronger military, and capital punishment. Bush has pushed into Democratic territory by making one of his priorities the improvement of schools attended by poor children. Gore has stepped into Republican land by promising to be so conservative with his spending that he will eliminate the national debt. </p> <p>Is it any wonder that America has ended up with a race both remarkably close and exasperatingly dull? The question is whether we have anything different in future years, regardless of how large the stakes or how important the issues? Combine the new digital technologies of direct marketing with endless campaign money, add the continued decline of American political parties once held together by ideology or class, fold in an abundance of vacuous, spin-dried, principle-free candidates, and we're likely to have larger, longer campaigns about less, culminating in lifeless dead heats. </p> <p>Alternatively, Americans may decide that they've had enough contrivance, and insist upon real candidates who will talk about real things and challenge the nation to debate its true fate. Listen carefully to the electorate and you can hear a yearning for a different kind of politics. Perhaps we haven't heard the last from the likes of a new breed of mavericks - among them Republican Senator John McCain, who mounted a strong challenge to Bush in the Republican primaries by arguing for laws to reign in campaign spending; former Senator Bill Bradley, who confronted Gore during the Democratic primaries; Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, now Green Party presidential candidate, who has generated unexpected enthusiasm (and may divert so many votes from Gore in Oregon and California that Bush takes those states); and Jesse Ventura, the unorthodox Governor of Minnesota. Or it may be another as yet unknown candidate who shucks the technology, takes risks, and tells it like it is. </p>",
  "On Thursday night, I was having a drink with Euan Blair. Since you're wondering, I was on the red wine; Euan sunk lemonades. He struck me as intelligent, poised - certainly much less gauche than I remember being at 16 - and charmingly undefensive, especially given that he was in conversation with the author of a book that has caused his father some recent embarrassment and the editor of Private Eye . Euan laughed at his own expense: 'I'm the family drunk.' <p>Only when we repaired to the bar did Ian Hislop, I or even his auntie Lauren become aware that Euan had been in the audience for a recording of Have I Got News For You , during which the Prime Minister's eldest son came in for some gentle ribbing and rather more scathing observations were tossed in the direction of his father. We were most savage about Tony Blair's latest colour change to green. </p> <p>Dad's big speech on the environment earlier in the week also featured a guest appearance by Euan, though this was less of a surprise. It is ever the Prime Minister's habit to deploy his children as a token of his sincerity about saving the world. He suggested that it was his son who opened his eyes to the importance of the environment when Euan butted into a discussion with a colleague and sat up debating with them 'into the late hours'. The Prime Minister expresses himself 'stunned' by how 'interested and knowledgeable' his son's generation are about the threat to the planet. This may tell us less about the young's grasp of the issues as Blair senior's lack of it. </p> <p>The environment has previously not much gripped the Prime Minister's imagination. His Government's record is not actually all that bad and, in some respects, it is quite good. Britain is meeting its international commitments to arrest global warming. But the environment has always been treated as an afterthought in the highest counsels of New Labour. Greenery was never regarded as integral to The Project. 'It is time to reawaken the environmental challenge,' says Mr Blair. That is, at least in part, because his Government has been content to let us slumber as the world chokes on the fumes of humanity. </p> <p>The cynic in us will say that Tony Blair has finally realised that there might, after all, be votes in the environment, especially among the younger section of the electorate who are switched off by grey politics. Just as there is a rising demand for more wholesome foods, so the electoral attractiveness of being politically organic seems to be dawning on Number 10. </p> <p>I'd also like to think that the Prime Minister is genuinely waking up to the consequences for the planet if we carry on abusing it. He described the scale of the menace rather eloquently. The alarming changes to the atmosphere darken the future of millions of people around the world. 'Here in the UK we too face threats - the prospect of exotic diseases becoming commonplace, of increased levels of skin cancer, of floods in some years, droughts in others, of low-lying areas being swallowed by the sea.' </p> <p>In comparison with those thundering horsemen of the apocalypse, a bit of cash from the lottery to encourage kerbside recycling and more investment in off-shore wind turbines is bound to sound bathetic, if not pathetic. The establishment of a green quango under Jonathon Porritt will be just another Whitehall wind farm unless it makes radical suggestions which are turned into legislation. </p> <p>The fate of Richard Rogers's urban task force, which offered the Government a transformatory plan to curb emigration to the sprawling suburbs by recasting our cities, is not terribly encouraging. Rumour suggests that Lord Rogers's proposals are being recycled into a tepid White Paper. A knowing chuckle must greet the Prime Minister's pledge that Britain will cut its carbon- dioxide emissions by 60 per cent by 2050. Even Tony Blair does not expect to be resident at Number 10 when Euan is a pensioner. </p> <p>That dreamy, distant target will not be entirely worthless if it helps to re-focus the Government away from its near-term obsession with not offending anyone in favour of the long-term measures needed to save our environment. Tony Blair emitted a cri de coeur about how difficult it was to resolve the conflict between 'a politician's need to woo the electorate as well as to lead them'. If his discovery of the environment is more than a passing fad, it will not be enough just to talk about 'hard choices'. He will have to make some. </p> <p>The Government will have to face down the so-called rural lobby who should not be confused with being green simply because they tend to be concentrated in the prettier parts of the country. Those who work the most beautiful parts of our environment can be its greatest enemies. Farmers are the worst polluters of the coun tryside, tearing it up, treating it as a rubbish tip and poisoning their own living with pesticides. There are those who fear that organo-phosphates will be the next BSE. Civil servants and Ministers have been rightly flayed for their grotesque failure to prevent mad cow disease. Guilt must also be pronounced on the subsidy-addicted agribusinessmen who turned cows into cannibals and wrecked confidence in farming. </p> <p>The Prime Minister will have to be less enthralled by the men of science who keep telling him that public wariness of genetically modified foods is just superstition, rather than a perfectly rational scepticism about the consequences of meddling with nature. That will mean being more robust with very large multinationals. The Climate Change Levy, to deter industrial pollution, is already being diluted before it has been introduced. Since heavy users of energy such as steel and chemicals won themselves huge reliefs from this green tax, others are predictably clamouring for similar exemptions. They will have to be resisted. </p> <p>Hardest choice of all for this Government, it will have to be firm with the motorist, that metallic, multi-headed beast whom Number 10 so fears to offend. Cars represent a quarter of carbon-dioxide emissions, let alone all the other toxic gases they pump into our lungs. Taxes on cars work. They take people off the road. The imperatives of short-term politics mean that Gordon Brown's forthcoming mini-Budget will be expected to contain something to soothe the discontent about petrol prices without appearing to appease the blockaders who brought the country to the lip of anarchy. </p> <p>Skilfully addressed, there is the opportunity to be both environmentally friendly and clever politically. The Government can make cuts in road tax to favour smaller, less thirsty vehicles and take measures to encourage greener hauliers. </p> <p>The tax windfall from rising oil prices can be put to work improving Britain's chronically under-invested public transport, especially a rail network so Third World that it is now paralysed by post-Hatfield emergency repairs. What a Prime Minister with fresh pretensions to being green should not be contemplating for a moment is any cut in fuel duty. The Tories will roar; the tabloids will scream. So be it. The world was never going to be saved without angering someone. </p> <p>Euan appears to have some green leverage on his father; perhaps he will make a submission to that effect. It would not be fair to reveal the contents of a private conversation with the Prime Minister's son, but I think he will forgive me for sharing with you how, as it got late, Euan executed a graceful exit. He had to go. Otherwise, 'Mum will kill me.' </p> <p>Our children will feel murderous towards us if we carry on killing the planet.</p>",
  "George W Bush said it himself: 'There must be no mistakes - I'm going to run hard all the way to the finish line. I never take anything for granted.' <p>Just as well - for his opponent Al Gore no doubt feels the same. The only certain thing about America's election in 10 days' time is that only a fool would call it. </p> <p>As Bush seemed to be stealing ahead by a nose, latest opinion polls put the candidates back on a razor's edge at 46 per cent apiece. It is the closest fought race since John F Kennedy beat Richard Nixon in 1960. </p> <p>That battle for the undecided votes at the political centre is reaching new levels of bitterness, with proliferating dirty tricks ranging from automated phone calls attacking Bush to inflammatory TV commericals suggesting Gore's Democrats are 'soft on China'. </p> <p>Both candidates, aware that the US public dislikes personalised politics, are trying to distance themselves from the increasingly vicious undercurrents. For example, thousands of phone calls to voters in Michigan carry recorded messages of women telling tales of death, illness and social neglect in Governor Bush's Texas. </p> <p>But there was also a storm of criticism of the commercial which questions Gore's resolution on defence. Based on the notorious 'daisy' spot the Democrats ran against Barry Goldwater in 1964, the commercial, being shown in swing states like Florida, Missouri and Ohio, shows a girl counting the petals on a flower and then switches to a missile countdown. The message is that the US is now vulnerable to nuclear attack from China. </p> <p>The reason for the high-octane virulence is not just that the election is close. Rather, Bush and Gore are fighting the most politically polarised election for decades, with radically different visions for America. The result will have a more lasting effect on the country and its relationship with the rest of the world than any since Ronald Reagan's time, maybe even since Kennedy's. </p> <p>Endorsing Gore last week, the New Republic magazine called it 'one of the defining ideological moments of the post-Cold War era'. </p> <p>As the two main candidates paint aggressively negative stereotypes of each other, two themes emerge: first, public distaste for negative politics, and second, the fact that the stereotypes are often accurate. Bush's demeanour, giving the impression of moderation, conceals an ideology that would eradicate the cultural - let alone political - values and legacy of the Clinton presidency, at home and abroad. Bush offers a domestic programme which, the international dimension of the Cold War apart, is brazenly to the 'right' of Reagan's. Internationally, Bush is an isolationist - in stark contrast to the man he aims to succeed. </p> <p>Gore, in turn, while making some concessions to Clinton's 'Third Way', has taken a step to the left of his mentor with a spending programme that more resembles Truman's or even Roosevelt's. Like Clinton, Gore is a passionate internationalist, and certainly the man Europe's leaders would want to see across the table. </p> <p>Talking to The Observer last week, Scott Reed, campaign manager for Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole four years ago, says: 'Time is the only commodity you cannot buy in the last two weeks of the election campaign.' </p> <p>Bush and the Republicans (who have an almost unlimited supply of money) seek, with considerable help from the Greens' Ralph Nader, to force Gore to travel in states he had assumed were his. </p> <p>Principal among these - and most alarmingly for Gore - is California, where Bush is closing his rival's 12-point lead and where Nader commands support among alternative lifestylers. Bush has his own Achilles heel in Florida, which should by rights be his (his brother is state governor), but where Gore is stealing a march among the crucial retiree vote. Gore cannot win without California, and Bush would find it hard without Florida. Otherwise, the battlegrounds are in the Midwest: Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and Pennsylvania. </p> <p>Those are the mathematics; the politics are less straightforward. At the core of the election is the fact, announced last week, that the United States is basking in the third consecutive year of a vast budget surplus - $237bn - the first time this has happened since the days of Truman. And the surplus is predicted to run to $4.6 trillion over the next decade. </p> <p>Bush's programme is a brazen one with a kernel of tax cuts, designed to cut back the growth of government and stimulate savings and investment. According to the group Citizens for Tax Justice, 43 per cent of his cuts, costing $1.3 trillion, would go to the top 1 per cent of earners, those making more than $319,000 a year. The bulk of the rest goes to the top tenth of earners. </p> <p>Few people making more than $100,000, however, would benefit from Gore's cuts, which cost $575bn and are aimed at middle- and low-income earners - part of an ambitious plan to raise their fortunes with new spending programmes and social entitlements. </p> <p>Bush assigns $48bn for education - less than half Gore's figure - and the two clash head-on over federal subsidy vouchers for parents wishing to opt out of the public education sector. </p> <p>Over Social Security and Medicare, Bush plans to create voluntary individual retirement accounts invested in the stock market, while Gore wants to leave the pension system unchanged and use the Social Security surplus to pay off the national debt and open a 'rainy day' fund for when the baby-boom generation retires. </p> <p>Gore wants to expand the government's contribution to the appalling Medicare system (albeit nothing as radical as the failed Clinton plan of 1993), while Bush aims to overhaul the system in the opposite direction, by making it compete with an enhanced private sector. </p> <p>There has been a lot of vitriol about 'fuzzy math' as Bush and Gore bark at each other over these plans, but looming over the shoulder of both candidates is the awesome prospect that the fuzziest math of all is that on which all their presumptions are made - that the surplus projections, generated by a Wall Street boom which could deflate, may be horribly exaggerated; that America's economic miracle is walking a high wire and neither will, in the event, be able to deliver. </p> <p>With a poll in Friday's Washington Post showing 64 per cent of Americans feeling they are 'winning' with the boom, few people heed the whisper of the Congressional Budget Office, which made the $4.6 trillion estimate but cautioned: 'Substantial deviation can result from incorrect technical and economic assumptions, not to mention the effect of future legislative action' - meaning, don't necessarily take our word for it. </p> <p>The CBO warns that, even under the most optimistic scenario, the cost of providing what is promised to the retired baby-boom generation will 'ultimately overwhelm the federal budget'. If the CBO has underestimated growth by 0.5 per cent, the Treasury would be $250bn short by 2010. Many voters remain undecided, and a thick fog hangs over the exchanges of 'math' and 'counter-math'. </p> <p>But the politics must share stage space with the 'beauty contest'. It is as though the US were a teenager on a date, trying to figure out which of two boys (both trying too hard) is the cutest; choosing between Bush's fluffier hair and Gore's muscles. </p> <p>Those watching on the sidelines regard the iconography of this election as between a 'moron' and a 'robot' (The New York Observer ). Gore spent the past week trying to vamp up recollections of wild college days riding motorbikes and wearing leather, while Bush has been at pains to sweep his frat-brat encounters with booze and cocaine under the carpet. </p> <p>Bush is a son and heir who never had to justify what he was saying. He has given the world 'Bushisms' even before the voting begins - saying 'hostile' when he means 'hostage', 'gracious' for 'grateful' - and to make a virtue of his own cumbersome lexicon: 'I've been known to mangle a syllable or two, if y'all know what I mean.' </p> <p>Gore has to be both lovable and lethal and cannot seem to get it right, between the nerdish desire to make sure his audience knows he knows everything - and the various other personalities and genetic modifications that his family and his spin-doctors have designed for him. </p> <p>Finally, there is the Clinton problem. Gore has claimed the mantle of Clinton's policies while keeping as great a distance as possible from the man he served. </p> <p>This week Clinton is going back on the road in Arkansas - campaigning for the deputy who will not share a stage with him. On that decision, Gore's fate may turn. </p> <p><b>Poles apart in policy and pitch</b></p> <p><b> Tax</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Bush</b>: Top 1 per cent of earners would benefit from nearly half his $1.37 trillion tax cuts. </p> <p><b> Gore</b>: Tax cuts worth $575bn with better credits for couples and carers. </p> <p><b> Social security</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Bush</b>: Voluntary retirement plan would invest 15 per cent of payroll taxes in stocks, with cut in guaranteed benefits. </p> <p><b> Gore</b>: Sweeteners for poorer women and workers, but would use social security surplus to pay off the national debt and create reserve fund for 'baby boom' cohort when it retires. </p> <p><b> Health care</b><br> </p> <p> <b> Bush</b>: Tax credits to buy health insurance, and new money for prescriptions.

  "<p>'We saved them a lot of embarrassment,' was the taciturn verdict of Tommy Helsby, senior executive with corporate security firm Kroll Associates. Embarrassment and probably a lot of money. Helsby was referring to one of his clients, a US internet giant, which was recently poised to launch in the UK. What the US dotcom didn't realise was that the head of the company it had chosen as its UK partner had been convicted of peddling indecent material. </p> <p>Maybe this was something that would not have worried the US firm's investors had they known. But the fact that the company had been kept in the dark by a potential business partner set the alarm bells ringing; the deal was pulled. </p> <p>With internet companies rushing to enter new markets as part of a frantic land grab, online firms are ignoring lengthy auditing procedures - designed to check the quality of their investors, business partners or staff - in a bid to beat the pack. This highlights the extremely fragile, get-rich-quick nature of the dotcom sector. </p> <p>Typically, Kroll would expect to find problems in 10 per cent of the people it ran background checks on - but last week the company sent shockwaves through the dotcom sector when it published a survey showing that senior executives at internet companies are four times more likely to have what Kroll diplomatically describes as 'unsavoury backgrounds'. To put it another way, of the 70 'due diligence' background investigations performed on key internet personnel by Kroll between April and September this year, 39 per cent of the subjects had been involved in illegal activities such as stock market violations, undisclosed bankruptcy and insurance fraud. These are all issues that would have raised huge corporate governance concerns and sent investors fleeing. </p> <p>Often those checked by Kroll were the senior personnel drafted in by the young, relatively naive, founders of dotcom firms looking to add experience to the board in a bid to attract further funding. Venture capital firms are usually wary of injecting cash until the management board has been beefed up with executives who have experience of running companies, not just starting them. </p> <p>But with background checks taking an average of six weeks to complete, some dotcom firms find they haven't the time to examine their new executives' credentials. </p> <p>Many in the dotcom sector expressed little surprise. 'We've looked at loads of dotcom companies, and in many cases it's always been quite clear that the management was never up to scratch,' said a spokesman for one US bank that invests in internet firms. </p> <p>An analyst with an internet research firm agreed: 'Given the huge amount of hype, it's not surprising that the sector would end up attracting some of the less credible types.' </p> <p>But it is not just the managements of some start-ups who represent the Wild West spirit of the darkest corners of the world wide web. Some of those seeking to back the firms have dubious backgrounds as well. 'We've had cases where people have come to us because they've been approached by mysterious people, usually based in an offshore tax shelter, who wish to invest big amounts of money,' Helsby said. 'These people would say \"we don't want to invest the $2 million you're asking for. We want to invest $5 million\".' </p> <p>He offers three possible responses for any dotcom company that finds itself in this situation. One: The people involved are unbelievably stupid, so don't deal with them. Two: They are money launderers, so don't deal with them. Three: They are scam artists looking to control the business in order to take it public and pump it out to gullible investors. </p> <p>This so-called 'pump and dump' habit is now increasingly common on the web. Investors pile into a company (usually penny stocks so that there is little liquidity, allowing for much greater price volatility), hype it in internet chat rooms, wait for the stock to soar and then sell at the peak. </p> <p>These types of schemes have been around for years but the emergence of the internet means they are now much easier to pull off. As Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said recently: 'The internet, with its low-cost anonymity and large number of innocent investors, makes it ripe for out-and-out fraud.' </p> <p>First, the hype around the actual internet stocks themselves has made investors more gullible and thus more hungry to take part in such schemes. Second, the internet as a medium has made it easier for more investors to get sucked into the mania, no matter where they are based. </p> <p>The most famous example so far came earlier this year when Eulex Corp, the giant US networking equipment maker, saw more than $2.5 billion wiped off its market capitalisation in only a few hours after a fake press release, sent to various newswires, claimed it was having to adjust its earnings and was consequently being investigated by the SEC. Investors dumped the stock, allowing those who had posted the warning to sell short and make a killing. </p> <p>As if to illustrate just how easy such schemes are to perpetrate (if not to get away with) last month 15-year-old Jonathan Lebed was forced to pay $285,000 to avoid prosecution by the SEC, which alleged he bought large numbers of shares and then proceeded to flood internet chat rooms, suggesting the stock was 'the most undervalued ever'. </p> <p>The number of such schemes is growing fast. Since 1995 the SEC has been involved in nearly 200 actions similar to the one it took against Lebed. More than a third of these have taken place over the past year. </p> <p>Worryingly, organised crime is now showing an interest. In June 104 people with suspected Mob links were arrested in the US following the largest securities fraud crackdown in the country's history. Those arrested dealt largely in small cap firms - the sorts of businesses that are usually ignored by Wall Street. It is alleged that those involved in the scam, including representatives of the notorious Bonanno crime family, the Mafia's largest drug dealers, developed a network of internet newsletters and chat rooms to promote the stocks they held. </p> <p>Helsby said: 'People think that these internet stock scams are done by 'boiler room' operators, the sharp city slickers, but very often they are linked to organised crime. </p> <p>'Typically a company set up in one country will sell securities issued in a second country to investors in a third. So the problem is who regulates? US and Canadian criminals are experts at this, but the Russian mafia is catching on fast.' </p> <p>Faster than the regulatory authorities anyway. Despite the growing concerns about the financing, management and fiduciary responsibilities of dotcom firms, policing the sector is still in its infancy. </p> <p>Not until next year will it become a civil offence for UK investors to initiate pump and dump schemes. Currently the authorities only have the power to initiate criminal proceedings, something they are reluctant to do because of time and cost constraints. It is symptomatic of the fact that, as more and more companies move at internet speed, the sheriffs of the wild, wild web find themselves outgunned.</p>",
  "The old man basked in the autumn sun and watched the girls go by on Tel Aviv beach and remembered the time back in '33 when, as a five-year-old, he had given the Nazi salute. 'The Nazis had just taken power and they were all Heil Hitlering and I joined in the fun too,' he said. 'And then a man came to me and said: \"Boy, are you Jewish?\" and I said: \"Of course I'm Jewish\", and the man told me to \"never do that again\".' <p>He laughed at his foolishness a lifetime ago and took in the scene: Baywatch on the Med, the curls of sailboats at sea, and not an hour's drive away the hells on earth of Gaza, Ramallah, Nablus... </p> <p>Mr Lind - he would not tell me his first name - left his native Berlin in '34. His immediate family got out via train to Constanza in Romania, on the Black Sea, then through the Bosphorus on a dirty ship to Haifa. 'Everyone else was seasick, but I wasn't. I loved that journey,' he said. </p> <p>The rest of the Lind family stayed on in Germany, sure that after a couple of years in power the Nazis would go away. How many of his relatives were killed? 'I don't know,' he said. 'Every time we asked my mother, she would just cry. Everybody else. Only we were saved.' </p> <p>We sat in silence, and after a proper time I asked him the banal, obvious question: What does he think of what is happening now, the Palestinian boys being killed for throwing stones? His wrinkled face lost its amiability: 'Now? They are trying to do what the Germans did to us. They want all the Jews out.' </p> <p>He could see from the look on my face that I was sceptical, that this justification wasn't good enough for 110 Palestinians shot dead in one month, so he went on the attack, his voice getting more strident with every remembered atrocity: '1921, Hebron. 1929, Hebron, everywhere.' </p> <p>The 1929 massacre happened when he was just one year old: 67 Jews were massacred in Hebron - at the revered burial place of Abraham - and the rest of the age-old Jewish community had to flee. But the history lesson had only just begun: 'The same in 1936. The same in 1947. My father had a shop in Tel Aviv, which he rented from an Arab who told him: \"We will fight against the Jews and we will throw them all out.\" The next year, they came to murder the Jews. They wanted us all dead.' </p> <p>Did he fight in '48? 'Of course. I was in the north, Qiryat Shemona, fighting the Syrians. We had Lee-Enfield rifles and two Cromwell tanks, the latest. We bought them from the British.' </p> <p>He went on: 'Until '67 we had no quarrel with them, then they tried to murder us all. So we fought, and King Hussein joined in, but he lost and the Arabs lost the West Bank. They fought us, remember?' </p> <p>Then the Yom Kippur War in 1973: 'Every 10, 15 years, they try to kill us all. They are doing the same now.' </p> <p>I asked him again about the shooting of the Palestinians, particularly the youngsters, the 12-year-old boy, crouched, howling with fear next to his father, before the bullet did for him. </p> <p>'I don't know about that,' he said. And the Jewish settlers, some of whom set out to provoke confrontation, do you support them? 'Don't ask me,' he said, but the look on his face suggested that he didn't support them so very much. He sensed the deduction I was making from that non-committed reply, and cut in: 'Listen, I'm a Jew. If they kill Jews, whichever Jews, I will fight against them.' </p> <p>He was a fine man, brave, courteous, funny, yet implacable, locked in a world where a massacre which took place when he was one justifies killings 70-odd years later. </p> <p>Behind the beach Tev Aviv bustles and bubbles, a brilliant, modern city, but there is something wrong, as if all the people in it are trapped in someone else's migraine. A Russian immigrant - one of hundreds of thousands - now working as a children's entertainer, complete with clown's face and daft outfit, tells me: 'I don't like it here. The people are too hard, too aggressive. I miss the snow, I miss the rain.' Would she go back to Russia? 'No, but I don't want to stay here for my life.' </p> <p>Chemistry student Sigal Levi, 20, was just coming out of lectures at the University of Tel Aviv. The daughter of Russian immigrants, she too was worried about the future: 'I don't want to bring up my kids in this atmosphere. If it goes on, then I want to go.' Why? 'We are afraid of bombers. Your next bus trip might be your last. Maybe that person coming towards you with a rucksack on his back might be a suicide bomber. People are scared.' </p> <p>Even in the sun-blessed streets of Tel Aviv, even in Baywatchland, you can feel the war, you can feel the fear. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\" target=\"_new\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party) <br></a><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "Oscar Wilde's grave in Paris has put up with a lot in its first century - the flying angel headstone has been castrated (twice), commemorative candles have scorched the front, and multilingual graffiti are regularly scrawled over the tomb. But now it's suffering from its most damaging assault: hundreds of lipstick kisses. <p>'It's been going on for decades, but the lipstick is just the final straw. Unthinking vulgar people may have defaced Wilde's tomb forever,' said Merlin Holland, Wilde's grandson. 'If these people want to honour Oscar Wilde's memory, then they should leave the bloody tomb alone. It's made me very angry.' </p> <p>Hundreds of Wilde fans are expected to visit the grave at P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery on 30 November to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the death of the poet, dramatist and wit. </p> <p>Graffiti include: 'You are the best! You can never die!', 'Oscar forever and more smack!', alongside misquoted lines from his poems. Only on the back of the tomb is there elegantly chiselled a poignant verse from 'The Ballad of Reading Gaol': </p> <p>And alien tears will fill for him<br>Pity's long broken urn.<br>For his mourners will be outcast men<br>And outcasts always mourn.' </p> <p>Holland, who is partly responsible for the upkeep of the famous tomb with its distinctive angel relief carved by Jacob Epstein, said that the rash of kisses - some hand-painted, others lip-applied - are the biggest threat to its future. </p> <p>'Marker-pen graffiti can be cleaned off, and anything that is scratched into the tomb can be rubbed down with sandpaper, but lipstick contains animal fats which sink in to the stone and also leave horrible marks. Even the monumental masons aren't sure if that can be removed. At the cemetery's conservation office they just give me Gallic shrugs and say: \"What can you do\"?' </p> <p>The only other tomb at P\u00e8re Lachaise to suffer similar damage has been Jim Morrison's. The Doors' singer was buried there after his heart attack in a Paris hotel room aged 28 in 1971. His grave became covered with colourful graffiti. Morrison fans also damaged neighbouring graves, painting arrows and scribbled notes (such as 'This way to Jim'). Now, though, apart from rolled-up joints and flowers, Morrison's grave is as sombre as that of a Second Empire banker's. Wilde's has become something he would have hated - gaudy. </p> <p>Wilde died aged 46 in poverty at the Hotel d'Alsace, 13 Rue des Beaux Arts, Paris, and was buried in a tomb paid for by an anonymous 'lady'. The headstone - a winged, naked and initially well-hung angel - was considered so offensive that the cemetery's head keeper castrated it and for several years used the testicles as a paperweight. Genitals were later restored to the angel, but they were stolen during the Sixties. In the early Nineties, Holland and the family of Wilde's literary executor, Robert Ross, paid for restoration work and a plaque at the base of the tomb which reads (in English and French): 'Respect the memory of Oscar Wilde and do not deface this tomb. It is protected by law as an historical monument and was restored in 1992.' </p> <p>'For years after that people would leave notes and bits of card which were elegant and touching. Then somebody thought it would be a nice idea to kiss the tomb. Then everybody else joined in. I don't know what to do now. Perhaps I should write to L'Or\u00e9al asking them to put warnings on their lipsticks. But I've got to find a way to restore the tomb, and it's going to cost money. I don't mind because he's my grandpa and I love him.' </p> <p>The damage is upsetting to Holland because he is planning to mark the centenary of his grandfather's death with an exhibition at the British Library called 'Oscar Wilde: A Life in Six Acts' which opens on 10 November. </p> <p>'For the past 20 years I had been compiling information about the whereabouts of manuscripts, photographs, cartoons and lots of Wilde's ephemera. It was a sort of finding list - if you wanted to know where to find the manuscript of his first play Vera, for example, which was inscribed to the actress Ellen Terry, then I knew how to do it. Then three years ago I was asked by the British Library to put an exhibition together about his life. I was in an ideal position to do it.' </p> <p>On display will be 250 items, including an autographed manuscript of De Profundis, Wilde's long confessional letter from prison to Lord Alfred Douglas, his lover, whose father brought about Wilde's fall from grace. Holland now devotes himself to writing about his grandfather and editing his letters. On Thursday, Fourth Estate publishes The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde edited by Holland and Rupert Hart-Davis, a sumptuous 1,200-page volume that includes hundreds of hitherto unpublished letters. </p> <p>The book includes a letter to Douglas. Written in March 1893 from London's Savoy Hotel, where he was staying in a \u00a349 a week suite, it describes his financial difficulties and his fondness for 'Bosie' who was, for Wilde, 'red and yellow wine'. The letter was used as prosecution evidence at Wilde's trial for gross indecency. </p> <p>'I'm sure he could have said that this letter was just poetic licence, written to a young friend. It was only when the prosecution started to drag in the rent boys that that line of defence collapsed,' said Holland, who is now writing a book about Wilde's posthumous reputation and the squabbles between his friends.</p>",
  "<p><strong>John Maynard Keynes: Fighting for Britain 1937-1946</strong><br>Robert Skidelsky<br>Macmillan \u00a325, pp624<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501013406,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Robert Skidelsky has pulled it off. He has devoted 20 years to his life of John Maynard Keynes and, with this, the third volume of a biography of Proustian proportions, he has demonstrated that the whole enterprise was worth every ounce of the struggle. </p> <p>The first volume, Hopes Betrayed, took us to 1920, and Keynes's The Economic Consequences of the Peace, whose concerns about the inadequacies of the Treaty of Versailles proved all too well founded. The Economic Consequences made Keynes world-famous even before the launch of Keynesian economics. And, as Skidelsky wrote at the end of volume one: 'In 1925, the world-famous economist would marry a world-famous ballerina in a blaze of publicity.' </p> <p> Hopes Betrayed was published in 1983, a time when the monetarist and extreme laissez-faire doctrines then prevailing indicated that the Keynesian legacy had been betrayed. The next volume - The Economist As Saviour 1920 - 1937 - came out in 1992 and had to compete with Maynard Keynes - An Economist's Biography by D.E. Moggridge, a distinguished professor of economics. </p> <p>Problematically, Moggridge took the story right up to the death of Keynes in 1946, whereas Skidelsky, necessarily but irritatingly, stopped a long way short. Nevertheless, there was a lot of good stuff in volume two, and what especially captured the imagination was the genuine love story between Keynes and that world-famous ballerina, the Russian Lydia Lopokova. </p> <p>The great thing about this third book is that Skidelsky has drawn on Roy Harrod (the first notable Keynes biographer), Moggridge and a veritable treasure trove of official and unofficial documents, not least the archives of the Keynes family and his college, King's, Cambridge. Harrod, who had worked with - and sometimes against - Keynes knew he was, in a sense, contributing to a later biography such as Skidelsky's when he wrote that, if he had made mistakes, 'through lack of sufficient perspective, these can be corrected by future students. My task has been to save them from mistakes, which there would later be no one to correct'. </p> <p>Skidelsky explained the background to Keynes's General Theory in volume two. As he wrote then, the trouble with the classical economists was that they 'lacked a theory of effective demand. The fatal flaw in the system he [Keynes] pointed out lay in the variability of spending relative to earnings... the result was that the market system was liable to collapse into prolonged depression'. But Keynes's purpose was always to make the market system work, not to replace it by communism or socialism. He was both a Liberal and a liberal, with a strong sense of community, and of the need for the government to fill crucial gaps. As Skidelsky says: 'His ideal was a mix of private and public patronage.' </p> <p>As Skidelsky shows us in this final volume, Keynes may have been a genius, but he was also a member of the human race, absorbed as much by the detailed management of his small Sussex farm as by high finance, serious economics and the arts. He was also battling against illness for much of this period, whether as 'entrepreneur' for the Keynesian Revolution or as - the major theme of the final volume - Britain's leading general in the financial war against America. </p> <p>For that is what it was. As Skidelsky puts it, while we were all fighting Germany (and the US had not yet entered the war) 'the Americans tried to use Lend-Lease as a lever to destroy Britain's pre-war financial and trading system, based on the sterling area and imperial preference'. From early on, Keynes, effectively Britain's chief negotiator with the Americans over paying for the war and preparing the postwar settlement, had as a goal 'the retention by us of enough assets to leave us capable of independent action'. </p> <p>Skidelsky argues that 'America's main war aim, after the defeat of Germany and Japan, was the liquidisation of the British Empire'. One of the greatest ironies was that Harry Dexter White, the senior US Treasury official with whom Keynes did so much negotiation over the postwar economic order and the difficult US postwar loan to Britain, was effectively a Soviet agent. Skidelsky gently puts it as a 'possibility' that 'White's pro-Soviet stance led him to advocate policies designed to boost the international position of the Soviet Union at the expense of Britain and Western Europe'. </p> <p>A lot of good it did. The Soviet Union did not ratify the Bretton Woods Agreement and that was 'the real start of the Cold War'. In the end, the wartime ally to whom White passed information became the 'Evil Empire' and Western Europe needed to be rescued economically by the Marshall Plan. </p> <p>The UK was still servicing and paying off the postwar American loan in the Sixties and Seventies. However great Keynes's intellectual powers, the US owned the postwar world. As Skidelsky says, Keynes defended the terms of the loan and the shape of the Bretton Woods Agreement as 'a reasonable compromise between two great nations with the same goal: to restore a liberal world economy'. </p> <p>People tend to forget how hard Keynes had to fight to get his ideas accepted. What astonishes the modern reader is how much he managed to fit into his life, including, while all the wartime negotiations were going on, with frequent trips to Washington, the creation of what is now known as the Arts Council. </p> <p>Skidelsky may feel that Keynes's followers pushed his economics to the limit - for Keynes, 'demand management' was more about variations in public-sector investment than discretionary tax changes - but, after a brief monetarist interlude, the Keynesian view that governments can intervene successfully to stabilise the economy is back in vogue, even if they prefer to do it via central banks and interest rates. It should never be forgotten that hoarding, nationally and internationally, can damage your economic health.</p>",

An ambitiously structured who- and whydunnit, narrated by a woman, Mrs Ranelagh, who, in 1978, found a neighbour dying in the rain-soaked gutter in front of her house, it succeeds magnificently at almost every level. Walters's psychological thrillers have always combined compassion and a strong social conscience with a ruthless ability to create unease, suspense and, sometimes, horror. </p> <p> The Shape of Snakes is angrily concerned with racism and our attitude to mental conditions: the dying woman, Annie Butts, is black and suffers from Tourette syndrome, whose symptoms include body jerking, talking to yourself and unwillingly spouting obscenities. Those around her, seeing only the symptoms and ignorant of the cause, nickname her 'Mad Annie'. </p> <p>Although the coroner decided Annie's death was accidental, Mrs Ranelagh has spent 20 years while living abroad trying to prove she was murdered by racist neighbours. Now back in England to confront suspects and witnesses, she reveals that most people on whom her inquiry touches, including her husband, have guilty secrets and the reader finds the chilling reasons for Mrs Ranelagh's own psychological quirks; seldom has a narrator started out more unreliable. </p> <p>Walters reconstructs Ranelagh's past investigation in the form of emails, letters, newspaper cuttings, transcripts of official reports and even, playfully, photographs, which I suspect come out of the Walters's family album circa 1978. There are perhaps a couple of particularly nasty but not-quite-convincing twists too many but otherwise this is a superb, compelling exploration of guilt and revenge. </p> <p>Walters's work has always adapted pretty well to television. Surprisingly, only this year, 10 years after Dr Kay Scarpetta made her first, trailblazing appearance in Post Mortem, has Patricia Cornwell's bestselling series been optioned for the movies. </p> <p><strong> The Last Precinct</strong> is Cornwell's eleventh Scarpetta novel and it's hard not to conclude that somewhere along the way the author has lost the plot. She's still unequalled at chilling us with the forensic detail of what suffering the human body can and cannot endure and nobody knows her way round a path lab better; as Val McDermid once remarked, most of Cornwell's regular readers could probably confidently perform autopsies blindfold by now. And The Last Precinct is a significant book in that it places Scarpetta squarely at a crossroads. Once it gets going - and it takes a while - it's a page-turning, bravura piece of writing. But I just don't buy it. </p> <p> The Last Precinct is billed as a sequel to Black Notice, which ended with Scarpetta narrowly surviving the attack of the werewolf Jean-Baptiste Chandonne. But it's more a reworking of that and a re-examination of other telling episodes in Scarpetta's recent past, from the death of her long-time lover, Benton, to the murder of her antagonist, Dianne Bray, as Virginia's chief medical examiner finds herself under investigation for murder. Unfortunately, Cornwell's ambitious attempt to rework those recent incidents involves plotting that in a writer first acclaimed for her realism becomes increasingly ridiculous. </p> <p>It doesn't help that even when Scarpetta is on the ropes and hounded at every turn, she still manages to come across as humourless, snobbish and holier than thou, characteristics that have been getting more pronounced with each new book. I understand that Scarpetta's impeccable taste is a deliberate counter to the gruesome requirements of her job as a forensic pathologist, but Cornwell can handle it so crassly. So there's always time, in the middle of the horrors and angst, to advise primly on the best olive oil or Italian wines to buy. </p> <p>The gang's all here in The Last Precinct including, of course, Captain Pete Marino, even grouchier than usual, and Aunt Kay's niece, the gung-ho, possibly homicidal Lucy. Lucy has always seemed to me essentially a plot device rather than a character - she's like Chandler's man with a gun sent through the door as a way of moving the plot along. So her abrupt change in circumstances near the opening of the novel might be ludicrous but does open all sorts of possibilities for where the series can now go. Back on track would be good. </p> <p>Marcia Muller made Patricia Cornwell possible. Just before Paretsky and Grafton came along, Muller created the first hard-boiled woman detective in her debut Sharon McCone novel. Now, 20 years on, female protagonists are ubiquitous in mystery fiction. <strong> Listen To The Silence</strong> shows that Muller has lost none of her taut storytelling skills as her series has progressed.</p> <p>There's a sense in which all mystery fiction is an exploration of the family and here McCone, who is part native American, investigates a family secret - her own family, her own secret. On the death of her father, she discovers that she is adopted. In tracing her birth parents, she goes deep into native American country and gets embroiled in a family feud and in violence past and present. Impeccably written and fast moving, this is straight down-the-line mystery writing at its best.</p>",

Black Cat, his follow-up, treads similar thrillery territory with less satisfactory results. A mismatched couple join forces in an attempt to track down a mysterious, panther-like creature, which is savaging local sheep, and, in the process, uncover some disturbing inner truths. This is your average nasty psycho-drama, sub-Barbara Vine, but efficient nonetheless. </p> <p>Bedford is strong on weather and scenery. He doesn't specify a setting for his story, but it's clearly Yorkshire. He evokes the moorlands with lucid ease: the bulk of hills abruptly rising up at the edge of town; big skies; 'the slow-motion uncoupling of the landscape's component parts' as dawn breaks. </p> <p>Lost in this landscape are his characters. Chloe Fortune is 22, the daughter of an Californian dowser, and that (apart from the fact that she was, until recently, a member of an anti-roads protest community called Flashville, and has recently split up with a crusty called 'Spoons', who accused her of being a lightweight) is all the background we're given. </p> <p>Stung by Spoons's criticism, 'perky, quirky' Chloe, now waitressing in a small Yorkshire town, looks for something that will prove him wrong. She'd been 'anti-roads, anti-nuclear, anti-capitalist, anti-establishment, anti-everything' for so long - now, she wants to be 'pro something... pro-active'. To this end, Chloe befriends a moor-dwelling loner called Ethan Grey, a former housing officer who has become a full-time beast sleuth and resolves to help him track the cat. </p> <p>Because she has inherited her mother's talents, she's soon dangling her wooden plumb bob over a map of the moors, trying to find the cat in its creases. Handily enough, she is able to identify where the cat has been and where it may be in a day's time. And she's usually on the nail. Divine inspiration, you see. Speeds up the plot no end. Trouble is, Chloe is paying more attention to her sixth sense than her common sense. In fact, Spoons was right: Chloe is a lightweight. She falls less for the notion of finding the panther than for the misfit Ethan himself. </p> <p>Suddenly, Bedford starts to add texture: excerpts from Hansard, police statements, reports from cat-hunters, zoologists, mythologists. Ethan steps out of the shadows and his awkwardness gradually shades into something more sinister. But Ethan, like Chloe, is never made real for us. We do not learn why he is the way he is. We must make do with the idea that his identity has become, in some mysterious way, defined by the creature he seeks. </p> <p>Bedford is not interested in the past, just the present. This proves a real obstacle to the reader who is trying to get lost in his story.</p>",
  "<p>It comes as no surprise, I suppose, to learn that Alan Bennett sleeps in his late mother's bed. Or to find that he takes quiet pleasure from the fact that the bed still bears the marks on its frame made by her toenails as she strained to give birth to his brother. There is something forensic, macabre even, about the way he clings to the detail of his growing up, to the conviction that if he scratches hard enough and often enough at the dull surface of his childhood he will reveal the ingrained emotional tracery that explains who he is. </p> <p>In the BBC's forthcoming Telling Tales, an autobiographical version of Bennett's wonderful Talking Heads, some familiar anecdotal keepsakes are thus once again brought out for inspection. There is, for example, the remembered 'dread of imminent exposure' when dining out with his parents in Leeds; the tale of his Uncle Norris who discovered the cure for arthritis, namely cutting the feet out of his socks; and the rerun of Bennett's pious teenage anxiety that he might catch VD from the Eucharist on Christmas Eve, when the congregation was swelled with sinners. </p> <p>These party pieces, made word perfect over the years, are punctuated by halting memento mori, as when he explains how he very nearly became a vicar, primarily because he looked like one: 'This is not as silly as it sounds,' he intones softly to camera, blinking a little through his glasses. 'People often end up doing what the mirror tells them they are suited for, while feeling themselves quite different inside. And in the process whole lifetimes are thrown away.' </p> <p>The 10-part series of short films, which begins next Saturday, seems part of an inclination in Bennett's most recent work to take personal stock. His friend, Sir Richard Eyre, sees it as the culmination of a familiar method. 'Alan is very systematic in working the narrow seams of his raw material,' he says. 'There was a Kafka theme; a royalty theme; a spying theme; and in this portfolio there is also a file marked \"Alan Bennett\". He approaches each of these subjects in the same way; he exhaustively mines his material for all it is worth.' </p> <p> The file marked 'Alan Bennett' contains the familiar version of himself that the playwright wants his audience to know, and perhaps to love. 'I'd rather the public had an image, and not quite fit it,' he once remarked. 'That way, you're free.' This freedom is carefully guarded. Bennett, now 60, never does press interviews these days, on the grounds that he feels 'less afterwards', although he was happy to be photographed for this piece. </p> <p>He is said to be troubled by an unauthorised biography, to be written by the comedy writer, Alex Games, which will be published next year. Bennett, characteristically, has reportedly been torn about whether to ask his friends not to contribute to the book; Games described to me his method of researching this most private of writers as being like 'keyhole surgery'. 'Alan has a need to be in control of things to a certain extent, certainly,' says Eyre. 'The idea of a public celebrity appearance, as himself, as the real Alan Bennett, is something that would fill him with absolute horror.' </p> <p>Some instinct of quiet control asserted itself from the outset of Bennett's career. In Humphrey Carpenter's recent account of the genesis of Beyond the Fringe, it is Bennett who comes across as the sternest and most exacting of the inspired quartet. Jonathan Miller, still Bennett's neighbour, confides that he always felt as though he was 'regarded by Alan as a sort of frivolous, non-contributing dilettante, whose capering around on stage got more attention than he, the diligent writer, got'. (Bennett, for his part, recalls how Miller, 'with characteristic extravagance, once threw a tea service at me. Though again characteristically, it missed'.) </p> <p>Dudley Moore was, in his own recollection, dismissed altogether by Bennett after hamming to the audience during a sketch. Though the pair had been in the habit of dining together before each show, from then on, Moore recalls: 'He never spoke to me. It was as though he had never met me. We never went out for a meal again. Nothing.' </p> <p>Still, the impetus to confession in Telling Tales, is not, it seems, simply a question of getting his version of stories in first. In recent articles, he has talked of clearing his shelves, of sorting out mental lumber, this, in part, in response, you might suppose, to a serious illness that he suffered a couple of years ago, from which he has recovered (and about which he does not speak). Last year, in particular, in a piece called 'Untold Stories', in which he detailed for the first time the extent of his mother's depression, there was a sense of him putting his house in order. </p> <p>The memoir placed his writing about his family history, the bedrock of his work, in a poignant context. When Bennett suggested in the past that 'we must love one another or die - of embarrassment', it had been easy to take the reference lightly, a wry comment on the strangled social awkwardnesses he so delights in exploring. </p> <p>In a sense though, Bennett's mother did die from embarrassment. 'Wanting to go unnoticed is what Mam's depression is about,' he wrote, recalling, as if it were yesterday, the day in 1966 when he and his father took her to Lancaster Moor Hospital, committing her to a psychiatric ward of 'unimagined wretchedness', and the innumerable hospital visits of the years that followed. She had found the Dales village to which she had moved from 'mucky Leeds' daunting and impossible because she felt the 'centrepiece there'; she had refused in the same spirit, as Bennett discovered in researching his memoir, a proper wedding, getting married at eight in the morning so as not to draw attention to herself. She wanted, in effect, to disappear from life. </p> <p> Until he was faced with his mother's depression, Bennett had always tended to think of neurosis as something 'put on', a way of making oneself interesting, and in this sense he imagined himself neurotic. Her condition forced him to come to terms with what he calls the 'mundane mad', and to explore that often painfully comic line between eccentricity and insanity, which is at the heart of his best work. In some ways, you could view nearly all of his writing of the last three decades as an attempt to understand that distinction for himself. The Madness of King George, The Lady in the Van, Talking Heads all have one thing in common: they are narratives of people who, in Bennett's terms, are part of a 'story to the meaning of which they are not entirely privy'. People, in this respect, like his mother. </p> <p>In a brilliant valedictory essay on Philip Larkin, who was an inspiration as a writer to Bennett, and against whose wilful bitterness he seems to judge his humanity, Bennett quotes the poet as having written that: 'My mother is such a bloody rambling fool that half the time I doubt her sanity. Two things she said today for instance were that she had thought of \"getting a job in Woolworths\" and that she wanted to \"win the football pools so she could give cocktail parties\".' </p> <p>In quoting this, Bennett notes how his own mother might have had similar aspirations, particularly about the cocktail parties, and in these passages you can see him marvelling at Larkin's liberating cruelty, and measuring it against his own more complicated compassion: his desire to do his best by his Mam, and his need to understand her legacy in himself. </p> <p>In the past, he has used a line from a Borges story to describe his own feelings as a comic writer, mining his family's life for 'material', which perhaps in this context can be understood: 'All the books he ever published filled him with a complex feeling of repentance.' </p> <p>Michael Frayn, who has known Bennett since National Service days, when they studied Russian together, and is now also a neighbour, suggests that 'what a lot of his work is about is the moment when people wake up to the fact that they have passionate feelings, feelings they did not, by background or circumstance, think themselves capable of; these might be passionate sexual feelings, or passionate violent feelings'. In some ways, he imagines, this is a catharsis that Bennett has felt echoes of in his own life, but if it is, it is not one that he has ever directly publicly addressed. </p> <p> In his most candid interview, with the New Yorker in 1993, Bennett explained how: 'I'd always been in love with guys... but always unhappily. They were straight and it was always totally unfulfilled... I was interested in sex, and whichever way any sex came along you just had to take it - that's how it seemed to me.' In this spirit, perhaps, Bennett then revealed that he had, for the previous 17 years, been enjoying a relationship with Anne Davies, 15 years his junior, who had once been employed as the cleaner in his London house. Bennett had bought Anne ('a reformed hippy') a tea shop in Clapham, the Dales village where his father and mother lived in later life, and where he kept a house (the same house in which his mother imagined intruders behind the pantry door; heard voices conversing in the living-room, and stood stock-still for hours in the hall, waiting for their chatter to stop). </p> <p>Davies set up home in Clapham with a younger lover, a dry-stone waller from Devon. She saw Bennett about once a month, she subsequently explained: 'He was always gay but he thought men didn't like him. It's like not being picked for the team at school... I was the only woman he had ever been close to... I was like an earthquake, turning his life upside down with my kids and lovers and mess.' </p> <p>Davies turned Clapham upside down, too, going barefoot in all weathers, wearing bells on her ankles; she was banned from the local pub, and scandalised locals by admitting on one occasion that she had daubed expletives on a heritage sign. In some ways, it seemed, she was another of Bennett's unruly alter egos (along with his late friends, Peter Cook and Russell Harty, in whose shamelessness he revelled), and you could imagine the attraction, the blissful private joke, of putting this woman at the centre of village life, the conventions of which had so hemmed his mother in. </p> <p>'Most men,' he once wrote, again with Larkin in mind, 'regard their life as a poem which women threaten.' For all his anxieties about his upbringing and his sexuality, Bennett has been conscious in his efforts to prevent his existence from being as miserably precious as the poet's. </p> <p>Unlike Larkin, he has created for himself a place where he can be comfortable with metropolitan life. His house, friends say, is a monument to his passion for home decor; he is a great cook: 'His kitchen,' one acquaintance told me, 'which you might expect to look like something from the 1950s, is actually a place where Nigella Lawson would feel very much at home.' </p> <p>Five years ago, Anne Davies remarked how Bennett had been involved, too, in a successful homosexual relationship, and that relationship continues. And, moreover, he has managed, as his diaries reveal, to make much of his life seem like one of his own amusing creations. (Richard Eyre believes that the kind of anecdote for which Bennett is famous tends to 'seek him out... when you are with Alan,' he says, 'you feel that his particular perception of the world is so powerful that the world itself becomes Bennettesque around him'.) </p> <p>'Art begins with imitation, often in the form of parody,' Bennett once observed, 'and it's in the process of imitating the voices of others that one comes to learn the sound of one's own.' He has spent his career and his life, in this sense, learning to love the sound of his own voice. One of the great pleasures of Telling Tales , and there are many, is to listen to that voice in all of its complex maturity; another is to hear behind those tales it tells, the ghosts of the tales he leaves out.</p>",
  "<p>Are you In the Mood For Love? It sounds like a romantic comedy - Ryan and Hanks, even Fred and Ginger - but there is nothing remotely comic here. This love is intricate, consuming and elegiac. And, though the mood is essentially European - say mid-career Truffaut, with a whisper of Brief Encounter - the setting is far away in the Hong Kong of the early Sixties. Wong Kar-Wai, chameleon amongst great directors, has done it again. </p> <p>Tony Leung Chiu-Wai is Mr Chow, a thirtysomething journalist with a pretty wife. Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk is Mrs Chow, a super secretary married to a travelling businessman. The couples find rooms to live in adjoining flats. Slowly, it dawns on Leung and Cheung that their increasingly absent partners are having an affair. Slowly, Leung begins his pursuit of the wronged wife and she begins to descend into an agony of doubt. If she succumbs, will she be any better than her faithless husband? </p> <p>Wong Kar-Wai does everything: action movies, cop movies, epics, often with a French new-wave feel of improvisation. Here, there is none of that. Instead, we move meticulously from one little box to the next, from one poky room to the room next door. Other rooms in the apartment block are filmed down corridors or over shoulders; the only excursions beyond are into deserted streets where rain falls torrentially around the sheltering pair. Complete claustrophobia. We never see the faces of the adulterous husband or his mistress, only their backs: they are ciphers throwing Leung and Cheung into starker relief. </p> <p>Does that sound a trifle dour? It isn't. The family who rent Cheung her room are warm and effusive, always offering food and companionship. Leung's hoary journalist mate is rounded and jolly. There is human life just across the landing or at the office; the characters are rooted in place and time - but that time, too, matters. Falling in love in the Hong Kong of four decades ago isn't a quick, modern fling. You feel the brooding disapproval of a more traditional Chinese society. Contacts must be secret, emotions hidden. Celia Johnson looks out of the railway carriage window. Upper lips stiffen and then quiver. When Cheung is trapped - innocently enough - in Leung's bedroom overnight, because others are playing mah-jong outside, there's no question of a quick roll on the bed. Cheung lies there alone, imprisoned by inhibition. </p> <p>Wong Kar-Wai is never entirely unobtrusive. The director's presence remains constant - sometimes playing jokes, like rehearsals of the farewell speeches Cheung will make to her husband, which appear, for a moment, to be the real thing. But that constant presence merely focuses us more hypnotically on the central relationship; and upon a particular sequence of months and passions locked away, resistance eroding as the mood takes hold. </p> <p>It doesn't work completely. Leung and Cheung are two of China's most f\u00eated stars, one stubby, battered and thoughtfully bemused, the other sinuous and tortured. They hold the screen and the still, silent Leung is especially hypnotic as he calculates and manipulates. But Cheung has an almost impossibly testing role. Can she make us, as twenty-first-century spectators, comprehend and share her inner turmoil? Can she become somebody we not only understand intellectually, but weep for in her desperate dilemma of the soul? </p> <p>Maybe Truffaut could have got that from Nathalie Baye, because her face is infinitely expressive and part of a world we understand. Cheung cannot quite convey that. She agonises, but she can't draw us in. The gap between eras and cultures is too great. The background score, by Mike Galasso, plonks away, sometimes Nat King Cole, sometimes second-hand Michel Legrand, so that you know you ought to understand. But no - you can see the suffering, yet you don't feel it. A love story without the hint of tear. </p> <p>But for all that this is an accomplished and memorable film, one that Wong Kar-Wai fought to finish through two years of censorship and Eastern financial crisis. Why should the censors have worried? There is no sex here, no sweaty coupling. This is love pursued, love won, love lost; love as a mingling of minds and calculation; love as regret. The chameleon called love.</p>",
  "<p>Steve Martin has a problem with 'hellos'. He doesn't quite know whether to gush or to play them for laughs. When Richard E. Grant, the English actor who is now one of Martin's closest friends, arrived in Hollywood to start working with him on the film LA Story, their first encounter got off to a stuttering start. </p> <p>'We are so thrilled you are able to do this movie,' said Martin, his face wreathed in the magnanimous smiles of the superstar. </p> <p>'Believe me, the thrill's all mine,' matched Grant. </p> <p>Then, as a long afternoon of exchanging sugary pleasantries stretched out before them, Martin suddenly switched tactics and went into a comic 'bit' that Grant has come to know as his 'all-purpose Showbiz Schlockmeister routine' and which involves showering the visitor with an intentionally ludicrous stream of stock insincerities. </p> <p>His pose as a gracious and civil host had lasted less than 30 seconds. This turns out, however, to be longer than many strangers get. Even the printed cards that Martin once handed out to autograph hunters did not take the idea of celebrity very seriously. They read: 'This certifies that you have had a personal encounter with me and that you found me warm, polite, intelligent and funny.' </p> <p>Over the 24 years since the comedian began to establish himself as a star on the hit television show Saturday Night Live, interviewers have often noted how difficult Martin finds it to present himself 'in person'. </p> <p>'He wants to be nice. But it is as if he is determined that you shouldn't have the chance to make any harsh judgments, so he goes into a comic persona,' said one New York film writer who spent a day with him last year. </p> <p>Whether this standard performance is a sign of shyness or control-freakery is anyone's guess, but certainly this month the 55-year-old is asking the world to look at him afresh. His first novella, a poignant romance called Shopgirl, has just been published and the star has taken the opportunity to tell the world that he wants to leave both the stage and the film lot behind him forever. </p> <p>'I've made two decisions in my life,' he said. 'One was to leave stand-up and go into movies. The other is to write. Now is my time to write.' </p> <p>Although Bowfinger, Martin's 1999 movie attacking the film industry, was critically well-received, he now intends to turn down the kind of parts that have recently earned him around $6 million a throw. A string of earlier flops, such as Mixed Nuts and Leap of Faith, have had an impact. 'It just wasn't fun anymore,' Martin explained. </p> <p>This spring he made his first concerted move away from film and back into television. He and his business partner, Joan Stein, have signed a seven figure deal with the Carsey-Werner studio, the makers of Third Rock From the Sun, Cybill and Roseanne. They plan to write and produce a weekly show. </p> <p>To underline the change in gear, Martin told fans who attended a New York book reading last month that he had hated his time as a famous comic. </p> <p>'I know it sounds clich\u00e9d, but it was the most miserable time in my life. I couldn't leave my hotel room, I couldn't go outside. I was isolated, and isolation is where creativity ends.' </p> <p>But then again, Martin was talking to an audience at the time. And he was wearing luminous green socks underneath his sober, literary suit. </p> <p>So are we witnessing the 'tears of a clown' syndrome once again? Is this another cult comic hero who obsesses about the lightweight nature of his talents? </p> <p>Martin, by now an acknowledged comedian, screenwriter, playwright, author and musician, is regularly likened to Woody Allen. And it is true they have both grown away from pure gags. But there are some big distinctions too. </p> <p>Allen's innate intellectual confidence means he has never strained to take on any of his new guises. What's more, while both Allen and Martin's early work - in films such as Sleeper and The Man with Two Brains, respectively - was funny because it was truly silly, Martin initially had much the blacker tone. It is Allen, then, who has pushed himself towards heavier dramatic forms and Martin who has leavened his career by taking the primrose path into the Hollywood mainstream. </p> <p>His 130-page novella marks a turning point. It tells the story of Mirabelle, 'a beautiful wallflower' in her early thirties who is looking for love as she sells gloves in the Beverly Hills store, Neimans. In what is surely a whisper of authorial wish-fulfilment, she one day meets a millionaire in his fifties and a bitter-sweet flirtation begins. </p> <p>Martin has said the experience of having his heart broken and of breaking other people's hearts has prompted the story. It is a much more deliberately sensitive piece of writing than seen in his best-selling collection of stories and sketches, Pure Drivel. </p> <p>In 1993 Martin broke up with his English wife, Victoria Tennant, with whom he had starred in LA Story. He then went on to a high profile relationship with the film actress Anne Heche, who eventually left him for the lesbian sitcom star, Ellen DeGeneres. </p> <p>Most recently the comic's name has been briefly linked with that of another English woman, Helena Bonham Carter, who will appear with him this autumn in a comic thriller called Novocaine. So far, the actor has no children, explaining that he is 'too selfish' and 'moves around too much'. </p> <p>Martin, the original whacko from Waco, grew up in Texas and later California with his sister, Melinda, in the care of upright, religious parents. He broke away from such church-going strictures when he started selling guidebooks in Disneyland and learned to play the banjo. </p> <p>A proper job in showbusiness came with the role of television writer for Dick Van Dyke and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, but real fame arrived in 1976 when Martin hosted his first Saturday Night Live. Easily distinguished by the rabbit ears and the arrow he wore on his head, Martin has always had a taste for simple vaudeville. One of his many stage acts, The Great Flydini, consisted of pulling a series of outr\u00e9 objects - for instance, eggs - from his unzipped fly. </p> <p>Unlikely though it may sound, international stardom followed quickly in 1979 with his film The Jerk and from then on Martin, much like Jerry Lewis before him, was to be strongly identified with the pratfall and the funny walk. </p> <p>His heroes, he says, were Jackie Gleason and Charlie Chaplin and, revealingly, it is their 'elegance' he singles out for praise. Martin's skill, far from a nerdy lack of physical control, is to see the discipline and grace required for this kind of comedy. Despite his frantic energy, friends and colleagues often sense a distance and a yearning for beauty and calm in Martin. </p> <p>Jonathan Lynn, the British film maker who directed him in Sgt Bilko in 1996, says he detected a certain remoteness in a man who was also, paradoxically, 'a national institution' in the United States. </p> <p>Martin's own sister has spoken publically too of his 'distance'. The siblings see each other infrequently and her brother, she has said, kept his links with the family to a minimum. </p> <p>In 1993 Martin made his debut as a playwright with Picasso at the Lapin Agile, a comic fantasy which went on to have a successful off-Broadway run. He has also appeared on the 'legit' stage in Samuel Beckett's bleak psychodrama, Waiting for Godot, at New York's Lincoln Centre. Nowadays, he is reported to spend a lot of time extending his valuable fine art collection. </p> <p>If Martin really does retreat from his fans and opt instead to create from behind the scenes as a writer or producer, perhaps the art of stand-up comedy should not feel too neglected. Tastes have moved on, and Martin's comparative restraint might not please the crowds any longer. </p> <p>After all, even The Great Flydini would look tame today when West End audiences are rolling in the aisles to the sight of live gonad manipulation in the Puppetry of the Penis.</p>",
  "Fighter pilots have long been the romantic action men of any air force. Now a new generation of combat planes threatens to turn them into desk-bound ground staff. A new fighter jet, being considered by Britain and the United States as the future of air defence, will operate by remote control, allowing the 'pilot' to operate thousands of miles away from the heat of the battle. <p>The Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (Ucav), unveiled by Boeing and the US Air Force this month, marks a controversial stage in aerial warfare. New technology behind the plane will mean a centralised command post in Washington can control a bombing run as far away as Kashmir. The Ucav is the final product of decade of research, and may solve the dilemma of today's politician - what can one do to attack foreign targets with ever-better weapons, without risking unpopular human casualties. According to Lt Col Mike Leahy, who helped design the jet at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in Virginia, the tailless, stealth craft will be able to carry multiple, precision-guided weapons and relay confirmed battlefield damage back to its mission control system. </p> <p>Designed to make dangerous attack runs into enemy territory and take out an enemy's air defences, Ucav is the latest step on from the Phoenix surveillance drones that were used during the Kosovo conflict to gather information from targets. The USAF hopes the Ucav could replace the F16 dogfighter. A prototype of the jet will be tested next year, and is expected to begin simulated bombing runs by mid-2002. The control centre, whose design has to be finalised, may be as simple as a desktop computer. Boeing claims the new system could cost up to 65 per cent less to produce than current manned alternatives. Operating costs could shrink to a quarter. </p> <p>The Ucav can be stored for up to 10 years between sorties. 'It's stored in ready-to-ship containers until needed, and will be able to deploy and operate across the globe in conjunction with manned expeditionary forces,' said Leahy. </p> <p>But the aircraft will stir up controversy among critics of the virtual battlefield, who feel the benefits of low casualties that a remote system affords are outweighed by an increased risk of error. During the Kosovo and Gulf conflicts, US and British air forces were criticised over use of 'smart bombs' that often missed their intended target and killed civilians. </p> <p>'If you are a pilot in an aeroplane being shot at it makes you think harder about what you are doing,' said Nick Cook, aviation editor of Jane's Defence Weekly . 'If you are flying a drone from the US it all becomes very easy.' </p> <p>One of the fears voiced concerns the quality of communications between the command centre and the craft. The Ucav could be controlled by satellite link-up from Washington or London, or from another command plane at a greater height. Although the jet can function on preprogrammed instructions, the command centre is expected to still be in control when the jet drops explosives. </p> <p>'The machine will have to roam over thousands of miles,' said Cook. 'The integrity of the system that links it to a computer is essential, and they have not sorted that out yet.' </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence, which last month published figures showing a shortage of recruits to the RAF, has considered the Ucav as an option to replace the Tornado fighter-bomber. The potential of the Ucav to drop nuclear weapons has been discussed, although a spokesperson said its range exceeded that which, under international regulations, an unmanned aircraft could travel with a nuclear payload. </p> <p>The technology will not be operational until 2010, but questions are already being asked about its impact on the future of war. The Ucav is one of five new areas being explored for defence purposes. Together with robotics, the US Department of Defense is also looking at ways of exploiting advanced power and propulsion, miniaturisation, mobile digital networks and biological sciences. 'We are not very far along in really exploring what these technologies may offer,' said Andrew Marshall, who heads the US military's long-term planning group, the Office of Net Assessment. </p> <p>Robotic surveillance snakes, genetically altered biological weapons to pick out healthy males in a crowd and spy helicopters the size of an atom are among combat systems under consideration. 'It's inevitable,' said Cook. 'If you take the design in the round, Ucav has been in the pipeline since 1990. It's a third of the price of an F16, and a quarter of the price of a Tornado. This technology is unstoppable.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nick.walsh@theguardian.com\">nick.walsh@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "It began as just another row about funding for the arts, but accusations of anti-Semitism and character assassination have turned the drama over Berlin's opera houses into a bitter battle of political ideologies, cultural visions and musical egos. <p>The outcome will determine the future of opera in the German capital and, according to some critics, shape the cultural climate in the city for a generation. </p> <p>At the centre of the row is Daniel Barenboim, the Israeli pianist and conductor who has been musical director of the Deutsche Staatsoper on Berlin's Unter den Linden since 1992. Barenboim last week accepted an apology from Klaus Landowsky, the leader of Berlin's Christian Democrats, who had referred to him as 'the Jew' Barenboim. </p> <p>Landowsky insisted he meant to compliment Barenboim when he compared him with Christian Thielemann, the 41-year-old musical wunderkind he described as 'the young Karajan'. </p> <p>'I have been working in Germany for many years with great joy and have been a resident of Berlin for almost a decade. I am very surprised to learn now, for the first time, that attention should be called to my Judaism in relation to my music-making or to my duties at the Staatsoper. I find this offensive and disturbing, be it mentioned in a positive or a negative context,' Barenboim said. </p> <p>Thielemann, who is musical director of the Deutsche Oper in the West of the city, has denied saying that, if Barenboim left Berlin, it would be 'the end of the Jewish mess' in the capital. A shooting star who made an acclaimed debut at Bayreuth this year with Die Meistersinger, Thielemann makes no secret of his delight in being compared with Herbert von Karajan, who joined the Nazi party in 1933. </p> <p>The young conductor insists his preference for German composers does not mean he is a nationalist. But left-wingers have long regarded him as suspect, and Barenboim revealed last week that Thielemann approached him three years ago to deny rumours he had made anti-Semitic remarks. </p> <p>'I accepted that and said to him: Christian, if it's not true, you don't have to defend yourself. If it is true, you have no business here.' </p> <p>Thielemann has suggested the latest rumours have been timed to prevent him from assuming a key position in a reform of Berlin's three opera houses. The Staatsoper and the Deutsche Oper would be merged with the loss of 353 jobs - including those of 77 musicians. </p> <p>Barenboim has described the proposal as 'cultural vandalism' which would destroy the identity of both orchestras and both opera houses. </p> <p>'It is a cynical proposal that may have been born out of despair. But it won't work, financially or culturally, to say nothing of the human dimension.' The Staatsoper orchestra, known as the Staatskapelle, is the second oldest in the world, with a history stretching back to the sixteenth century. </p> <p>While Barenboim has been fighting to retain the separate identity of the opera houses, Thielemann has hinted he would happily take charge of the merged opera. Thielemann is due to leave the Deutsche Oper next year when the composer Udo Zimmermann, with whom the young conductor says he cannot work, takes over as artistic director. </p> <p>Under the merger plan there is no role for Zimmermann, and Berlin's Culture Minister has indicated he would like Thielemann to play a leading role in the new structure. </p> <p>The opera house battle is taking place amid a heated debate over a call by the Christian Democrats' parliamentary leader, Friedrich Merz, for the country's Leitkultur, or 'defining culture', to be protected from the influence of immigration. Some critics regard the attention drawn to Barenboim's Jewish origin as part of a trend towards cultural nationalism that borders on racism. </p> <p>Barenboim wants the federal government to take responsibility for the Staatsoper. The government says this is out of the question. Thielemann has been playing down the rumours of anti-Semitism and insisted last week that Berlin remained a model of tolerance. 'In our orchestra we have 16 different nationalities. I work with singers, most of whom don't come from Germany, and with orchestras in Europe, the US and Israel. Berlin is the most liberal city of all,' he said. </p> <p>\u0095 Denis Staunton writes for the 'Irish Times'.</p>",
  "The hills that surround Bogot\u00e1 were wrapped with long, low strands of cloud. The sky was a flat, greasy grey. Beyond the huge municipal dump, the sprawling city ended abruptly. After the maze of corrugated-iron roofs, wires and TV aerials of the squatter camps, the hillsides were an abrupt green. <p>Oscar Ruiz and his wife, Martha, and their four children can just see the hills if they walk to the highest point of their barrio (slum neighbourhood). But they haven't been out of Bogot\u00e1 since they arrived. </p> <p>Fifteen months ago, the family were forced to flee the farm in the jungles of the far south of Colombia that had been their home for 15 years. Oscar says that to walk among hills above his slum neighbourhood would make him homesick. Anyway, he adds, wounds he received from right-wing paramilitaries who evicted him make exercise difficult. </p> <p>Oscar is a desplacado - one of 35,000 'displaced' by the filthy, decade-long war that blights Colombia, once one of Latin America's richest states. </p> <p>Many flee rural areas for the relative safety of the cities, particularly Bogot\u00e1. Oscar's home is close to Bol\u00edvar, the biggest of the squatter camps that ring the city like a skin disease. Jes\u00fas, my taxi driver, said it would be too dangerous to take a gringo into its winding, rubbish-strewn lanes. </p> <p>In the dusk, Bol\u00edvar, named after the liberator who freed much of the region from Spanish colonial rule, looked strangely beautiful. Tens of thousands of softly lit shack windows stretched all the way up to the ridge and the mild evening sky. </p> <p>As we drove through the barrio's outer streets, my taxi driver Jes\u00fas, who himself lives on squatted land, spoke of gang fights, drugs wars and 10-year-olds addicted to glue. Few can afford cocaine, even at $10 a gram. </p> <p>Crime in Bol\u00edvar is so bad that shopkeepers and residents have whip-rounds to hire assassins to kill suspected wrongdoers. </p> <p>Many of the inhabitants of Bol\u00edvar and other barrios are desplacados who, like Oscar, have fled from one battlefield only to end up trapped in another. There are bitter turf wars between right-wing paramilitary groups and the left-wing Farc (Armed Revolutionary Front of Colombia) over homes. Currently, in Bol\u00edvar at least, the Farc is, Jes\u00fas said, the de facto local authority. </p> <p>A battle between the Farc and the right-wing paramilitaries (who share responsibility for the massacres, gang-rapes, kidnappings and disappearances that scar Colombia's recent history) forced Oscar off his coffee, banana and dairy farm in the southern Putumayo district last year. </p> <p>Putumayo is the hottest combat zone in the country, close to some of the biggest coca-growing areas. In many ways, the battle there is over cocaine. Both the guerrillas and the paramilitaries, who are funded by landowners and have strong links to the Colombian military, try to control the population through intimidation. </p> <p>In the last year, to pre-empt Plan Colombia - the massive American military aid package designed to win the war against the guerrillas for the government - the guerrillas launched new offensives. And the paramilitaries responded. </p> <p>In September last year, 40 heavily armed paramilitaries walked onto Oscar's farm. 'You have been collaborating with the guerrillas,' they told him. 'You must leave your land.' </p> <p>There was little that the slight, softly spoken Oscar could say in defence. When, on several occasions, the Farc arrived at the farm wanting breakfast, he had fed them. 'What else was I to do?' he asked me. </p> <p>The paras gave him a week to leave. He refused to go. After eight days, they smashed his door, took his eldest son hostage and then shot Oscar when he tried to stop them. Two bullets hit his arm, two his belly and one his shin. </p> <p>He managed to run away and hurl himself into the river nearby, which marks the border with Ecuador. Fished out by an Indian in a canoe, he spent the next six months convalescing across the border before returning to find his family in Bogot\u00e1. </p> <p>Or some of his family. His eldest son had remained a prisoner of the paramilitaries. After eight months in captivity, he had escaped and, amazingly, found his family in Bogot\u00e1. But he had changed. The paras made him kill a man, and he had been splattered with his victim's blood and brains. They injected him with drugs. He had been driven insane. He died in Oscar's arms in a Bogot\u00e1 hospital, only 11 years old. 'My last memory of him,' says Oscar, 'is of his eyes staring out of his skull. He had seen things no one should see.' </p> <p>Now life is a struggle for food and warmth. The six of them live in a small room. Oscar, who is 34, occasionally gets some work as a labourer. Otherwise they live on handouts. The government has aid programmes for the desplacados, but corruption and inefficiency means most is siphoned off into the rich elite's offshore bank accounts. </p> <p>Oscar has been arrested for protesting over this 'robbery' of the aid his family needs. </p> <p>He is not afraid to be named, though he does not want to be photographed. He plans to organise more demonstrations. 'Tell the world about these bastards who are taking the bread from our mouths,' he tells me. </p> <p>Jes\u00fas shakes his head as he turns the taxi back towards the centre of town, the good hotels and expensive restaurants and the shopping malls where you can buy \u00a3100 handbags. 'Someone will kill him soon,' he says sadly. 'He is making too much noise.'</p>",
  "<p>There is not a flower in sight at Nikki Tibbles's west London home. The florist to the stars (her clients include almost every fashion designer in London, as well as companies including Chanel, Ralph Lauren, Ian Schrager's hotels, and Tiffany) prefers to live in a flower-free zone. There are, however, lots and lots of vases. She collects them - especially those made by the New York potter Jonathan Adler, which go perfectly with her collection of classic modern furniture.</p> <p>'I very rarely have flowers at home,' she says. 'I tend to just stick them in a vase, and then they annoy me.' On the odd occasion when she adds blooms to her home, she says she chooses something white for her ground floor living space - 'white tulips or hydrangeas' - and vibrant, clashing colours for the basement. 'I don't like that many flowers,' she confides. The ones she does like, though, she adores with a passion. She will use them en masse - a bunch of deep red, velvety Grand Prix roses packed so tightly together there isn't enough room for even the tiniest greenfly to sneak through. </p> <p>Tibbles is a one-off. Her florist business, Wild at Heart, prepares the most magnificent bunches that make an impression wherever they go. She has a way with colour - her bunches positively vibrate. 'I love clashing colours - as long as it's the right flower. I also love tones of one colour,' she says, sitting in her minimal, white Notting Hill flat, which she shares with her husband and her two dogs, Maisie and Rose. She's dressed in Chanel - a neat top and a skirt printed, appropriately enough, with camellias. Somehow, you can't quite imagine her snipping away at rose stems, or heaving armfuls of long stems out of the back of her van.</p> <p>But when Philippe Starck and Ian Schrager were putting the finishing touches to their St Martin's Lane Hotel, it was Nikki who was perched on top of a step ladder, loading oversized hydrangeas into the colossal vase that forms the centrepiece of the lobby. She left her Prada heels at home that day. She also worked with the design team, making an ironic statement with begonias in pots for the bedrooms and carnations in the restaurant. 'It was all so slightly tongue-in-cheek,' she says. 'You couldn't put begonias in any other hotel.' Predictably, both begonias and carnations have become fashionable. 'Carnations are amazing flowers,' she says. 'They have wonderful texture and colour. I think they're much maligned.' </p> <p>It is only seven years since Tibbles started out in business, with a flower stall on Turquoise Island, on fashionable Westbourne Grove. She did a degree in Sports Science, and then worked at various advertising agencies around London. 'It was the thrusting 80s, and I really wasn't very good at it,' she admits. And then a friend asked her to help put the flowers together for a wedding. 'It just suited me,' she remembers. 'I don't have a long attention span. I can't write, or paint or draw. Flowers are a great medium for me.'</p> <p>She jacked in the advertising job and went to work at a florist, for \u00a32.50 an hour. She has built up her business by trial and error. At Turquoise Island, the stall which still sells sumptuous bunches to regulars and passers-by, she worked from eight to eight every day, building up a core of loyal fans. She now employs around 30 people. Her clients include Loewe, Chanel, Cerruti, and her friend, Betty Jackson, whose house she decorated for her 50th birthday. During London Fashion Week, Tibbles decorated the celebrity-studded Philip Treacy party at Tiffany. A typical fashion party flower budget can run up to \u00a335,000, more for a big wedding. But as Tibbles says, that buys a lot of flowers. She has also worked on flowers for films, including Wilde and Wings of a Dove. </p> <p>The run-up to Christmas is one of Wild at Heart's busiest times. Over the next month, the Burberry, Tiffany and Ralph Lauren stores will all be given the Tibbles touch with tasteful, fragrant displays of Christmas cheer. There are also parties and events to organise, not to mention her own book launch at the beginning of November. </p> <p>The book, Wild at Heart, published by Conran Octopus, is a lavish, colour-saturated affair. You can almost smell the roses as you flick through its glossy pages. For most of us who do not have access to Wild at Heart's shops in west London, or at The Great Eastern Hotel in Liverpool Street, this is the next best thing. It's also about as far away from prissy flower arranging as a book about flowers can get. It's as modern in spirit as Tibbles's Future Systems architect-designed shop. 'The Wild at Heart philosophy revolves around passion and intuition, sophistication and simplicity,' she writes in the book's introduction. 'I want to show how flowers are more than an afterthought, that they are integral to an interior or an occasion.' </p> <p>Tibbles worked alongside the interiors photographer Martyn Thompson, shooting in themes ranging from 'pure' (three white vases with a single narcissus in each) and 'sensuous' (a jug filled with hyacinths) to 'chaos' (a vintage red vase crammed with overblown poppies). There is no 'how to get the look' element in the book because Tibbles felt her arrangements were pretty self-explanatory. She does not go in for exotic flowers, or anything pretentious or fancy. 'I love traditional flowers - peonies, sweet peas and roses, tulips and anemones,' she says. 'Simpler flowers. I hate flowers that are ugly, or tropical or look cheap. Yellow flowers always have that cheap look.' </p> <p>Vases are important, but she had plenty of places to borrow them from. The Westbourne Grove area is an epicentre of interiors accessories, with shops like Space, Carden Cunietti, Themes and Variations, and Vessel, who all lent jugs, vases and other containers for the pictures. The combination of vase and flower is all about scale, proportion and colour. A giant amethyst-coloured Murano glass vase, made especially for the shoot by Amy Cushing, is topped with a tiny cluster of simple blue muscari, that look as though they've just been picked from the garden. In the florist's downstairs basement, which has just had a glass extension built, looking out on to the garden, a shelf is packed with multicoloured vases, many of them vintage glass and ceramics, bought on her travels, and each of them just begging to be filled with flowers. </p> <p>The book is certainly inspirational. Just as you might try a recipe if you have easy access to the ingredients, so you will definitely be tempted to replicate some of Tibbles's floral ideas. How about a goldfish bowl full of hydrangeas? It's as easy as it sounds, but looks cool and modern. And if you only have access to carnations, just buy several bunches and cram them together tightly in a vase. You'll be amazed at how expensive they look. 'I was worried that the arrangements should be more complicated,' she says. 'It couldn't be simpler.' But that's just what makes it so inspiring.</p>",
  "'What's in that big box, Mum?' <p>'It's a Land Rover, Maud.' </p> <p>Quizzical look from Maud, three-and-a-half years old. 'What, like Johnny the Builder's Land Rover, Mummy?' </p> <p>Not exactly. Johnny the Builder is one of a not-so-rare breed: Land Rover Man. There are two variants of this breed, and Johnny the Builder is the more likeable, romantic type; he is Old Land Rover Man. He has two Land Rovers, both built in the 80s. In May, he spent a weekend putting the gearbox of one into the other, because summer was coming and he would be using the non-paint-covered, roofless version more than the heater-equipped fully enclosed one. Both gearboxes were knackered, but this one was less so. </p> <p>Men who own old Land Rovers do that sort of thing. They're rugged, you see. The men, that is. The vehicles are less so. People believe Land Rovers can cross deserts, uninhabited landscapes and ice floes with ease. They're British, tough and uncomplaining, with battle scars and hidden depths. The spine-wrecking seats, non-existent shock absorbers and patchy green and brown paint only increase their value as a motorised, romantic folly. Not that Johnny and his kind can see that: they're blinded by love. </p> <p>New Land Rover Men, on the other hand, love their vehicles because they are a sensible style statement. New Land Rover Man used to belong to the 'County Set' - they once owned land which they'd farm. But today they only drive to the country (where the trickiest terrain they encounter are the puddles on the newly widened A666) from their work in the City, and their homes in London's deep Ws, SWs and far Es. These men relish their Englishness and wear tweed woven in Taiwan. And have plenty of children. 'The more the merrier, because the world's too full of them and not enough of us, what!' </p> <p>Which is where pushchairs come in. Pegasus Pushchairs has built an all-terrain buggy with all the appeal and sensible structure of a Land Rover. It even comes in Land Rover 'livery', which is actually a piece of green canvas done up to look like tarpaulin, and is stamped with the Land Rover marque. This is resolutely not a trendy, three-wheeled baby-jogger. Oh no. This is a tough, no-nonsense, inflatable-tyred style statement. It says so in the press release. It's a 'tough, go-anywhere product to match an adventurous lifestyle.' </p> <p>Right, we told Maud, we're going to go anywhere in our Land Rover, what do you think, Maud? Oh, she's gone off to read Hansel &amp; Gretel to Barbie. Edie (18 months) is interested, though. She's climbed in already. She never does that with the other pushchair. Mind you, the other pushchair is not taking up a third of the enormous kitchen extension so recently built by Johnny the Builder. Off we go. </p> <p>Camden High Street might not be the Highlands, but it's pocked and slippery and filled with wildlife. The buggy glides though the messy mass of goofy Goths and Japanese tourists without turning a head. So we head for Primrose Hill and the more appreciative flocks of wannabe Jude'n'Sadies, yoga-barefoots and older parents who are seriously into Style Statements. </p> <p>When we push Edie in her MacLaren buggy with Maud on the buggyboard through Primrose Hill, people look at us a little askew, as if to ask, why have you strapped your poor daughter to the back of that whitetrash contraption? Now, with Maud being forced to walk as the buggyboard won't fit the enormous wheel base of the Land Rover, Edie is carried along like a mini Cleopatra and the perfectly flossed in the Regent's Park Road caf\u00e9s smile at her as if to say 'We accept you, one of us.' It's hell. </p> <p>Running across the grass on the hill, the buggy travels lightly and fairly smoothly, although an attempt to swerve right too quickly almost threw the thing over. And parking it on the incline needed a hefty swipe at the brakes to get it to stay in place. Edie, though, is in bouncy-castle heaven, gurgling happily at every aerobicised bump. There's actually very little support for her head or back in this thing (but then Land Rovers don't have headrests and only put seatbelts in because it's the law), and there's no reclining element to the seat. It's just a bit of sack slung over two poles. </p> <p>In the playground, it attracted the attention of an older father (in tweed) who's very impressed by the Land Rover badge. He's definitely a New Land Rover Man. 'What's this, eh?' He asks - all glad-fellow-well-met - while casting an anxious glance at Maud's dad's number-two crop. 'Gad, wouldn't mind one of these. Any good?' Well, that depends. Do you have more than one child? 'Ah yes, got three.' Well, it's difficult with this model, but there's a double seater. It's difficult to steer with one hand, you see, because you have to push the handle down to raise the front wheels in order to turn or get up the pavement, and it's quite wide and the brakes don't work brilliantly... 'Just like the motor, eh? Haw, haw.' </p> <p>Back at home, getting it over our high doorstep, the chassis is scraped. The yellow paint comes off. Edie laughs. And carries on laughing as we try to get the thing down. Leaning frontways over the handle to reach the levers you end up huffing and puffing like a hunted fox. </p> <p>Yes, this is certainly a Land Rover. When down it doesn't fasten together, lies only flat-ish, and any attempt to move the folded vehicle results in flapping arms, bruised knees and giggling children. Presumably, one is supposed to leave the thing in the boot of the 4x4 covered in mud and then throw it ostentatiously out on to the Kensington/Putney/Bow/ pavement, letting it snap into place as it lands. </p> <p>Johnny, when or if he has kids, would probably like a second-hand one of these. He'd probably customise it with an old leather armchair, or something. Edie likes it, too. But then, whenever Johnny comes into our house she points at him, smiles and says, 'Dadda.'</p> <p><b> Land Rover's pushchair</b></p> <p> <b> Price </b> \u00a3385 <br> <b>Weight </b> 14lb (5.9kg) <br> <b>Height </b> 38in (94cm) <br> <b>Wheels </b> 4x12in <br> <b> 0-60ft </b> 12 seconds (if child strapped in tightly)</p>",
  "Albert Louden is one of Britain's best-known and most successful Outsider artists. His paintings are sold at auction at Sotheby's and Christie's. A neat, shy man in black trousers and brown Chelsea boots, he sits in his living room in Leyton, east London, and talks about art and life. On the carpet next to him are copies of the new Blake biography and Isaiah Berlin's The Hedgehog and the Fox. <p>The room's dull colours form a good neutral background for several small, luminous paintings which shine on the walls. The work is instantly recognisable as Louden's. There are strange cartoon-like figures, androgynes sprouting tiny humanoids along the curves of their lips and arms; bulbous men with dome-heads painted in blocks of bright pink, red and yellow; skinny domineering women; backdrops of child-like tower blocks with tiny windows and claustrophobic rooms.</p> <p>The colours have the impact of a Matisse; the strange characters betray the sneaky oddness of a surrealist's mind. Louden calls them his 'internal landscapes' and says he has no idea where they come from or what they mean. 'I think they're odd,' he says, 'but not depressing. I've destroyed sackfuls of them in the past because they came out vicious or nasty.' </p> <p>Louden is unhappy about the label 'Outsider' which originally launched him on the art scene. Thirty years after his work was first exhibited, he feels the term ghettoises him. The Outsider Art concept can be traced back to the 1930s and the paintings done by patients in a number of Swiss mental asylums. The French painter Jean Dubuffet called the work Art Brut (Raw Art). In turn, art historian Roger Cardinal coined the term 'Outsider Art'. Picasso and Klee were amongst the early artists drawn to the genre, inspired by their shared fascination with psychoanalysis. </p> <p>Because most Outsider artists steer clear of the art world and of each other's work, and have no theoretical basis or analysis for it, there is little chance of a 'movement'. They tend to work like techno producers and computer nerds, tucked away in a timeless vacuum at home; sometimes only discovered after they die. They just get on with it and are often amused and surprised that anyone will sell or buy their outpourings. Today's artists have little in common with 1930s mental asylum patients, but they do share a lack of art training and no motivation to paint-to-sell. Without exception, they have to paint or draw. </p> <p>Louden works for seven hours most days when he is not globe-trotting with his paintings. Articulate and self-educated, he was a Marxist activist in east London's labour disputes of the 60s and 70s. He used to store his huge canvases in his garden shed, but they rotted and he had to throw them out. These days, he sells paintings in New York and was recently invited to show in Quito, Peru, at the Mexican Cultural Centre. 'I sold some paintings, too! ' he laughs shyly, hand over mouth. 'The German ambassador bought one.' Louden's work appears in London galleries beyond the tiny Outsider circuit; he plans a 2001 exhibition in Mayfair. </p> <p>Louden paints in the front bedroom where weights and a fitness machine share space with yet more paintings. This is where his latest work can be found. Even though the curtains are drawn, the colour on four huge canvases pours like sunlight through cathedral windows. Clotted oils shift from one rich colour to another. But where are his Louden people? 'I've been experimenting,' he smiles. 'I always experimented, even at the beginning, abstracts as well as figures.' He reveals a mildewed scrapbook containing blurry, 20-year-old prints. Some look like Turner landscapes. 'I'd been arguing for a long time with my work, in isolation, but never came to terms with it,' he says. </p> <p>The British market for Outsider Art was first championed by the late Victor Musgrave, a leading light on the 60s art scene. He promoted the work of Britain's best known Outsider artist Scottie Wilson. Wilson, who died in 1972, was a self-taught, working-class man who specialised in intricate ink-coloured drawings of strange flippered creatures and trees filled with mythic creatures. It wasn't long before other collectors became interested. Henry Boxer started collecting visionary and mystical works in the 60s: 'These outsiders and psychotics appealed to me because they were doing things without any drugs at the time when we were using LSD and mescaline to get to the same place,' he recalls. </p> <p>George Melly has been a collector of Outsider Art for more than 30 years. For him, it fulfils a lot of what surrealism achieved. 'You lower a bucket into the mind, pull it up and examine it,' he states with relish. 'It's the lack of consciousness and self-consciousness that I like. Artists today are so self-conscious, they consider the market first, whereas for Outsiders, the thing exists of itself and they do it because they have to - whether it will sell or not. Art should be magical, and these are magical, compulsive things.' </p> <p>These days, the London art map is being re-written by a handful of maverick dealers who are specialising in this awkward genre of Outsider Art. They are viewed by the majority of dealers with almost as much suspicion as the artists they represent. The problem is that they promote work which lacks the very commodity which keeps the Hoxton-Saatchi scene alive: a concept. Instead, Outsider Art combines a contemporary edginess with irrepressible exuberance and frequently reveals a sophisticated design sense reminiscent of the tribal artists working in Africa and Australia.</p> <p>A new landmark in Outsider and Marginal art is the England &amp; Co Gallery, located in the golden retail mile of Westbourne Grove, between Agn\u00e8s b clothes and Tom Conran foodstuffs. Jane England is attracting buyers who include 'art' on their shopping lists. England is fiercely protective of the artists she exhibits, and yet she also wants to bring them to a wider audience: 'They shouldn't be treated like mushrooms and kept under a stone,' she says sternly. 'They're not freaks!' </p> <p>England's current exhibition is a collection of strange, perverse pencil drawings by a Kent geography graduate called Chris Hipkiss. Stand close enough to them and visitors disappear into intricate, alien landscapes, fields and city streets. Intriguing from a distance, close to they divulge some startling secrets: rows of women hanging upside down compose a hedge, strapping dominatrixes driving bobsleighs made from mutant trees, fields of corn cobs numbered like soldiers in a drill parade or mutated into missiles. </p> <p>Hipkiss also dislikes the tag of Outsider artist. He insists he's just 'an ordinary guy. I wear jeans and T-shirts. I've got a degree in geography. I draw. That's what I do.' He draws obsessively for hours on end at the table in the living room of his small rough-and-ready cottage in Kent, with the cats cavorting around him, and the television on in the background. As a child, he made models, encouraged by his father who runs the family joinery business where Hipkiss used to work. He sees no difference between what they each do for a living. He has strong views about 'outsiderness' and thinks there are few real outsiders at work today. 'People making environments, using shells and stuff, or living in institutions where they don't know about the world, come closest to real outsiders. They'll be discovered when they die. I'm definitely not an outsider, I'm in the world,' he says. </p> <p>John Maizels, editor of the glossy magazine Raw Vision, and author of the lavishly illustrated book, Raw Creation has a unique international overview of Outsider Art. The magazines reports on all kinds of beautiful and terrifying sculptures, doodles created on scraps of old cornflakes packets, recycled canvases built from bits of timber, stone, shells, and junk - work from countries as diverse as Croatia, Italy, Slovakia, Moscow, Japan, the United States, and Britain. Raw Vision is based in Maizels's incongruously quaint Hertfordshire cottage, which doubles as a gallery. The deceptively quiet former art teacher has a punkish delight in the art which now rules his life. For him, Outsider artists are 'people who are completely out of it, automatic. They never make changes or mistakes, don't take the pencil off the paper until it's finished. It just flows from the subconscious.' His house is filled with the stuff. </p> <p>Albert Louden and Chris Hipkiss feature in Maizels's collection. As does the work of Damian and Delaine LeBas. Some artists, like Hipkiss, resent the label Outsider, but Damian LeBas, who comes from a line of tinker families based around Sheffield, has always felt like an outsider. The fact that both he and his wife went to art school - they studied fashion and textiles - would appear to disqualify them from the Outsider clan, but their art was never consistent with college rules. Today, Damian and Delaine who comes from a large south-coast Roma-gypsy family are the glamorous couple on the Outsider network, but their everyday life brings them abuse and insults for the way they look and live. Their home in Worthing is filled with gnomes and Elvis memorabilia, Damian's obsessive football collections and crazy paintings and Delaine's gypsy art and fabric collection.</p> <p>Damian LeBas made waves during his time at the Royal College of Art, where he would draw the tattoos on builders' arms rather than classic designs on Greek ceramics during museum outings, and embroider denim jackets with sequinned abstract designs while other students created curtain fabrics. Drawing was an early escape route from a disturbed childhood, 'I started drawing football crowds when I was six,' he remembers. 'I was fascinated by the patterns and colours,' he says. Cats are a lifelong obsession. Some years ago, he produced dozens of cat paintings with acid-hell Catherine-wheel eyes, drawn with clashing bright pencils and oil pastels. 'I did about 10 a day,' he recalls, 'so many, I thought I was turning into a cat, because I'm so hairy. I got very paranoid.' </p> <p>Delaine LeBas could have been many things in life - fashion model, designer, artist. Her startling beauty and highly personal dress style has some of the kitsch beauty of the fairground. An early work called Me and my husband shows Delaine in a yellow, rose-covered jacket and flouncing tiered skirt, and Damian in soul boy's baggies and braces. They are standing in front of a caravan window and framed by floral designs which look like embroidery. Her gypsy background informs everything she does. 'My mum and dad always dressed me in strange, bizarre things - two-tone shoes, coats covered in tapestry, fancy things. But I'm glad for it. I'm an eternal child. I never make plans or drawings, it is all spontaneous.' </p> <p>Being an Outsider is not something Delaine considers relevant in her work. 'The art world is incredibly conservative. It's difficult for me to work in it because of what I am and where I come from, what I look like. I thought it was supposed to be about interesting people, fantastic things, but they ignore people like me.' For Delaine LeBas, the Outsider world is like family, just a collection of eccentric people ploughing their own route through life, and having fun on the way. </p> <p>Alex 'Perifimou' Georgiou also lives in Worthing and is a great friend of Damian and Delain LeBas. The 84-year-old Greek-Cypriot plays bingo once a week with his neighbours, drinks freshly made Greek coffee and is always on the lookout for a new lady friend. His flat is comfortable and homely, and filled with souvenirs from Cyprus. But there are also some small, brilliantly coloured paintings of cartwheeling animals and odd human figures - all painted at the dining table in this same room. </p> <p>Perifimou's early years, in a poor village just outside the Cyprus capital of Nikosia, were wretched, and he moved to London in 1935. He shifted between various jobs and then landed at the Royal Academy as a warder and later moved to the Tate Gallery. He sat among all the great paintings of the Western world, but only those of William Blake stirred him. He started drawing at the age of 59, discreetly making visual notes on small pieces of paper as he sat in his warden's chair, transforming them into small paintings later. </p> <p>Perifimou's forte is colour. He uses bright primaries blocked out into solid shapes and broken into scaly or feathery detail. Mythical, uncreated animals and acrobatic humans are his typical characters, the men with grinning expressions and whorled eyeballs. His neighbour, Damian LeBas explains Perifimou's art in terms of his Greek background: 'He was brought up thinking Ulysses was real. He says the stories are Greek dreams and all his own paintings are about Greek mythology.' Perifimou is far less analytical and simply shrugs with the now familiar response, that he loves to draw. </p> <p>There are some critics who believe that it's almost impossible to find genuine Outsider artists in Britain today. Either they have been trained in some way like Damian and Delaine LeBas, or they become successful and automatically gain entrance into the mainstream art world. </p> <p>An instinct for selling his work, for instance, has meant that Albert Louden has been 'excommunicated' from the Outsider clan. 'I had to hand my badge back,' he jokes. Prices for his work top \u00a35,000 in this country, higher in the US. Next year, an exhibition of his work is planned in Mayfair. </p> <p>Pearl Alcock, however, might be considered closer to the original definition of the word Outsider. She came to painting through necessity. When her local dress shop in Brixton, south London, failed and she was on the dole, she couldn't afford a birthday card for a friend so she painted one instead. That was back in 1985. An elderly Jamaican woman with an outgoing personality but poor health, she rarely leaves her first-floor flat. Instead, she sits in a special rocking chair and waits for the world, and what she calls her 'visions', to come to her. She sleeps a lot and has perfect recall of a rich dream world which is as real to her as waking time. </p> <p>Her sitting room is hardly a typical artist's atelier; the paints, brushes, sketch pads and paper are tidied away in the sideboard. And most surprisingly, the walls are bare. 'Everything I do has to come from my head,' Alcock explains, 'and that's why there's no pictures. I don't want them to disturb me.' I ask if a particularly vibrant landscape with heavenly-blue sky and hibiscus-red flowers were a Jamaican memory. 'I don't know,' she laughs. 'These things just come to me.' </p> <p>Pearl's paintings fit into three categories: narrative portraits, mostly without titles, although she conjures some up on the spot - 'The Africans', 'Woman and T'ief', 'Mermaid' and 'Merman'; flowers and abstracts, which create repeated patterns and reveal a tremendous intuitive sense of design. These are easily her most 'sophisticated' works in conventional terms. Birds regularly visit her visions, yellow canaries with puffed-up breasts based, elongated blue birds.</p> <p>She discusses all her works, as if seeing them for the first time. 'This bird is as big as the two boys,' she giggles at its ridiculous proportions, but adds that she really likes it. She is particularly fond of a beautiful portrait of a women with tearful eyes, painted in Tretchnikoff greens and blues. 'This woman died and when she woke up she was very sad because it's not like she thought.' But even Pearl has her collectors. George Melly lists her as a favourite artist and owns several of what she calls her 'dreams' and 'mood paintings'. Monika Kinley, one of the country's leading advocates of Outsider Art, calls her 'a visual poet'. In 2001, Pearl's work will be exhibited at the October Gallery in London. </p> <p>Will the Outsiders ever come in from the commercial cold? Jane England thinks Outsider Art should merge with the rest of the art world. 'I want to see an Outsider Room at the Tate Modern,' she says. West End dealer James Colman, who includes Scottie Wilson's works in an otherwise conventional modernist mix, thinks dealers should support young Outsider artists. 'It's bloomed in the US and the rest of Europe,' he says, 'but here it's still a gamble. It's up to us.' Perhaps the final word should go to Albert Louden, the ex-Marxist. 'It's all about market forces,' he says. 'I sometimes wonder if it's got anything to do with content. The young artists and the galleries are all a social network. Outsiders will never be in on that.'</p> <p>\u0095 Chris Hipkiss - Visionary Drawings is at England &amp; Co, 216 Westbourne Grove, London W11 (020 7221 0417) until 4 November</p> <p> Outsider websites: <a href=\"http://www.rawvision.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.rawvision.com</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.outsiderart.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.outsiderart.co.uk</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.abam.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.abam.org</a></p>",
  "<p>Each night in Monte Carlo, it is said, a recording of predatory birds is transmitted through hidden loudspeakers in the main square to prevent sparrows from soiling the famous casino's pristine lawn. And each morning a platoon of gardeners removes dying petals from the immaculate flowerbeds. Amid such stainless perfection, a prison could look embarrassingly conspicuous. The authorities in the world's wealthiest state have dealt with the problem by locating the local jail on the very extremity of its tiny landmass. Of the thousands of tour- ists who file past the old fort on the rocky promontory of Monaco Ville, between the Oceanographic Museum and a cheesy celebration of the Grimaldi family called the Monte Carlo Story, very few realise that incarcerated within its walls are the principality's 20 or so prisoners. There are no signboards nor, indeed, any apparent entrance. The only clues to its true purpose are the bars on the windows and the battery of security cameras on the roof - hardly an atypical sight in Monaco. </p> <p>Among the inmates, most of whom are imprisoned for fraud or other white-collar crime, is Ted Maher, a 42-year-old former Green Beret in the US Army. Last December, Maher was arrested following the deaths of billionaire banker Edmond Safra and his nurse in circumstances that remain oblique and subject to a multitude of speculative theories. Initially, Maher was not a suspect. Those who were, suggested one newspaper, 'range from the Russian mafia to Japanese investors, through drug cartels and Middle Eastern trading companies'. It seemed that Safra, 67, who was renowned for his protective shield of Israeli bodyguards, was a man with no shortage of enemies. And, equally, Maher, a smalltown American who never travelled beyond US borders in his three years in the army, appeared to be someone who was a total stranger to both drug cartels and the Moscow mafia. </p> <p>How he came to be in Monaco was a result of unforeseeable happenstance. Working at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, where he had qualified as a licensed nurse, Maher found an expensive camera which he promptly returned to its owner. The photographer mentioned the story to an associate, Safra, who was sufficiently impressed to offer Maher a position as part of his 12-strong medical team - the banker suffered from Parkinson's Disease. </p> <p>The unworldly Maher spoke not a word of French. Safra, a Lebanese Jew with Brazilian nationality who lived mostly in the south of France, was fluent in French, English, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic and Hebrew. Maher was a tall, slender man with an open manner. Safra was short and bald and enigmatic. Maher had an ongoing property dispute with his next-door neighbour in upper New York State. Safra owned a vast penthouse in Monaco and La Leopolda, the magnificent villa in Villefranche built on the estate that once belonged to Belgium's genocidal King Leopold II. He also possessed homes in Paris, Geneva, London, New York and Brazil. </p> <p>In any other circumstances, the closest Maher might have come to Safra would have been to cash a cheque in one of his banks. But, as it was, Maher left his wife and three children in Stormville, New York, and his secure post at Columbia-Presbyterian, and flew to the French Riviera and a $600-a-day ringside view of the life of one of the world's richest and most mysterious men. </p> <p> As far back as 1957, Edmond Safra was named as a drug trafficker in a US Bureau of Narcotics report. The accusation was later withdrawn, but until his death Safra was the inspiration for countless unsubstantiated rumours that linked him to drug, gold and currency trafficking, money laundering and organised crime. </p> <p>The Safra family came from the Halabi merchants of northern Lebanon, a close-knit clan of Sephardic Jewish traders who historically made their money from financing the camel caravans of the Middle East. Edmond's father Jacob opened the family bank in 1920, building on the Safras' long experience in gold and currency exchange. Sephardic tradition maintained that the family business should be passed on to the oldest son. But such was his precocious interest in banking that the young Edmond leapfrogged his elder brother, Elie, to be selected by his father as the prime heir. At just 16, Edmond went to Milan to learn the banking business and then on to Brazil, where he set up his first bank at the age of 21. </p> <p>In contrast to most banks, Safra's was built on deposits rather than loans. It may be this strategy that originally led some observers to view Safra's banks as attractive propositions for money launderers. Five years ago, New York magazine ran an investigation into Safra's Republic National Bank in which it claimed that the bank 'quickly became known on the street as a bank that would send an armoured car to pick up large sums from its more secretive customers'. </p> <p>In the 80s, Safra and Republic were the targets of a global whispering campaign. Among the allegations that surfaced in a variety of mostly obscure publications was the suggestion that he was involved in the Iran-Contra affair; that he arranged the murder of a security specialist who had supposedly discovered a link between him and the arms-for-hostages scandal; that he had double-crossed the Medellin cocaine cartel; that he was a confr\u00e8re of mafia legend Mayer Lansky; and that Republic had laundered the drug-trafficking profits of Panama's General Noriega. </p> <p>Only the last claim had any basis in established fact, and Republic was only one of a number of banks that held Noriega's funds. Eventually, Safra proved in court that the rumours emanated from his corporate rivals, American Express, which had bought Republic's Swiss parent company, TDB, in an acrimonious deal in 1983 (Safra regained control in 1988). American Express was forced to apologise and donate $8m to a number of charities, including the Anti-Defamation League. For many people in and around the world of banking, however, Safra's legal victory served only to increase their suspicions of the secretive Lebanese businessman. In New York and London it was customary to grin in a knowing fashion whenever Safra's name was mentioned. Now the grins were that much wider. </p> <p>Bryan Burrough ascribed the slurs aimed at Safra to anti-Semitism in his book Vendetta: American Express and the Smearing of Edmond Safra . But if anti-Semitism alone was the reason for the stories, then why was Safra singled out and not the innumerable other Jewish bankers operating in high finance? It would be rather as if Michael Jordan had been selected for racist abuse on account of being a black player in basketball. Whatever the true explanation for the attacks, Safra was acutely sensitive to their effect on his good name. He was determined to sue any publication, however small, that repeated the libels. </p> <p>While American Express was waging its smear campaign, American customs officers were investigating Safra's banks for laundering Colombian drug funds. No charges were brought. Yet when the news emerged that Safra was dead, the prime suspects were not embittered former American Express executives or Colombian drug lords, but the Russian mafia, or mafiya . </p> <p>Three factors pointed in its direction. First, Republic's dealings with Russia were well documented. Under licence from the US government, Republic shipped around $10bn of US currency a year to Russian banks. Although perfectly legal, the shipments caused no little consternation among some state agencies. The problem was that many banks in Russia, and up to 50 that Republic was trading currency with, were suspected of being at the very least unreliable and quite possibly fronts for the mafiya. Referring to this apparent criminalisation of cash, a source from the Criminal Investi gation Bureau of New York State Banking Department told New York magazine: 'To us it was like a sore on Cindy Crawford's face.' </p> <p>Second, at the time of his death, Safra was engaged in the protracted and problematic sale of Republic to HSBC. There were various hold-ups, but one of them was said to be the Russian accounts that were frozen as a result of Federal investigation into money laundering, which Republic itself prompted by alerting the authorities to its concerns. Observers speedily concluded that a short-changed mafiya chief had sought revenge. Some 90 or so bankers have been killed in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. 'What you have to understand,' Stephen Handelman, an expert on the mafiya and author of Comrade Criminal , told me, 'is that bankers are different in Russia. Over 2,000 banks were set up after 1989, most of which have since collapsed, and many of the people behind them had emerged from the black market and criminal backgrounds. So often when a banker is killed he may himself be involved in the mafiya.' </p> <p>And third, the French Riviera, which enjoys a rich history of Russian influence dating back to 19th-century aristocrats, had seen a sudden and ostentatious influx of newly wealthy Russians. Tales of Moscow businessmen buying yachts and property for cash formed the gossip of sales people from Cannes up to Menton, who, while often offended, seldom refused the money. In Nice, the mafiya was said to have bought into the exclusive Marina Baie des Anges, where the head of one Russian crime gang was arrested with false papers and fled to Monaco. In the past three years, Monaco has itself expelled 15 Russians suspected of illegal business practices, including a former KGB colonel. And some lawyers say that Monaco has now adopted an unofficial policy of refusing entry to all Russians. </p> <p>Arnaud Montauibourg, a French MP who led a parliamentary investigation into the mafiya, thinks the mafiya has already 'penetrated Monaco', laundering money 'through real estate, the casino and through trusts'. Sitting outside the Caf\u00e9 de Paris in Monte Carlo on a soft autumn evening earlier this month, watching the hopefuls making their way to the casino, it was not hard to spot the Russian businessmen. They have little apparent fear of cultural stereotyping. Thus two men with gold bracelets and neck chains sat drinking vodka and smoking weighty cigars, largely ignoring their two women companions whose compliant demeanour, polite laughter and visible stocking garters made it plain that they were part of the night's entertainment bill. </p> <p>It's this kind of egregious behaviour that has placed the Russians, whether legitimate business people or not, at the centre of a near moral panic hereabouts. The Russians are coming, is the anxious chorus on the Cte d'Azur, and everyone assumed they had come for Safra. </p> <p> At 5am on the morning of 3 December last </p> <p> year, Ted Maher awoke his boss with news that two masked men had broken into the belle \u00e9poque building at 17 Avenue D'Ostende in Monaco. Maher was bleeding from three stab wounds. Although a former Green Beret, Maher had served as a medical auxiliary. He had no more experience of combat than he did of high-style living. He was there to tend his employer, not protect him. For that, Safra had his Israeli army bodyguards. But not in Monaco. So safe did he feel in his penthouse next to the renowned Hotel Hermitage, that he maintained the security team at La Leopolda, 10 miles away. </p> <p>It was there during the 80s that Safra, under the guidance of his Brazilian socialite wife, held celebrity-enriched parties of daunting splendour. Lily, whom Safra married in 1976, had three children from a previous marriage and was independently a very rich woman. Nevertheless, the prenuptial agreement she signed was said to have run to 600 pages. It was she who ensured that names such as Aristotle Onassis and Frank Sinatra were included on the Safras' guest list. John Fairchild, the arbiter of American high-society standing, was moved to speak of the couple's 'meteoric rise to social power'. </p> <p>But social acceptance had not lessened Safra's near-phobic paranoia. He always carried blue gemstones to ward off the evil eye, and retained an abiding fear of curses. He was deeply superstitious about the number five and was terrified of being kidnapped. So he must have been deeply scared early that morning when he learned from Maher that the state-of-the-art security system in the building, which also housed three banks, had been breached. Immediately, Safra retreated with another of his nurses, 52-year-old Viviane Torrente, to his steel-reinforced bathroom. </p> <p>Within minutes a fire broke out. This is how Monaco's assistant prosecutor Catherine Le Lay described the scene: 'The apartment is immense, and within it there are two separate wings, one for Mr Safra and one for his wife. Mr Safra was in his wing, which consisted of three rooms - his bedroom, a nursing laboratory and a bathroom. With him were two nurses. The police received a call from the receptionist of the building. She had been alerted by the male nurse, who had staggered from the apartment which occupies the fifth and sixth floors, down to the ground floor. He had been injured with a knife with a six-inch blade. </p> <p>'The police arrived at the scene extremely quickly and when they arrived they were un able immediately to access the apartment, which is protected by steel-reinforced doors. When they did gain entry with the firemen, the fire had already taken hold in the flat, which was extremely difficult to bring under control. When the police were finally able to penetrate the flat, they found Mr Safra dead where he had taken refuge in the bathroom with his nurse, Viviane Torrente, who also died. </p> <p>'His wife was not even roused by the drama. It is difficult to convey just how big this flat is, but I have never seen anything like it. She was separated by a good distance from her husband and each door was reinforced. By the time the firemen had mastered the fire, smoke was only beginning to affect her wing of the flat, which would have rendered her more deeply unconscious. We still don't know how the attackers got into the flat, or how they escaped.' </p> <p>Safra and Torrente died from smoke inhalation. The fumes reached them through the fire-detection system. With its 500 officers, Monaco is probably the most intensively policed square mile anywhere on the planet - the local constabulary likes to boast that it can close down all exit routes from the principality in minutes. Its border with France is only notional, but the police always man it. Its streets and buildings are also the world's most intensively filmed. </p> <p>Very few square feet remain unrecorded by the ubiquitous security cameras. But there was no sign of the intruders. The idea that two men could break into the heavily secured home of one of the world's wealthiest men, cause his death and leave without trace did not sit well with Monaco's reputation as a crime-free zone for the super-rich. </p> <p>The police became convinced that it was an inside job. Within two days of Safra's death, Maher was arrested. And, shortly afterwards, he told police that he had stabbed himself and started a fire and that there were no intruders, masked or otherwise. His actions, he said, were an attempt to gain his boss's respect. He spoke of not getting along with the head nurse, a woman named Sonia, and how he wished to circumvent her power by demonstrating his loyalty to Safra. At a news conference, chief prosecutor Daniel Serdet quoted from Maher's police statement: 'It was my own dark ideas which led me to do this.' </p> <p>This was an extraordinary turnaround. From a story of high-financial corruption and international gangsterism, it became one of a misguided approach to job promotion. Police announced Maher's confession on 6 December, the same day that Safra was buried in Geneva. Around 1,000 mourners attended the ceremony at the Hekhal Haness synagogue, including the Nobel Peace laureate Eli Wiesel, Israel's foreign minister David Levy, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan and former United Nations secretary general, Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar. Also, on the same day, the US Federal Reserve approved the sale of Republic to HSBC Holdings, and four weeks to the day after Safra's death the $9.85bn deal was completed, netting Safra's heirs some $2.8bn. Could it really be that strange and that straightforward? </p> <p> In America, the conspiracy theorists' medium, the internet, has been hot with indignation. There is much talk of Maher's 'imprisonment as a scapegoat for Russian money- launderers' and he is referred to as 'prisoner of war'. 'Please help him,' runs one appeal, 'before he is killed by the Monaco government or the responsible parties that did commit this crime and used Ted as a scapegoat.' Much of the stuff is hysterically xenophobic, virulently right-wing and clearly the work of delusional minds. Of course, that doesn't mean that Maher isn't a fall guy. However, his defence team certainly do not see Maher as the victim of a fiendish plot. </p> <p>Georges Blot, Maher's Monegasque lawyer, has gone on record as saying that his client started the fire and stabbed himself. 'The first words Ted said to me when I met him were: \"This is horrible. I loved him. I admired him. I respected him. I don't understand why I did it.\"' </p> <p>Maher's family in the US are unimpressed. They say that the internal security videotapes, which they believe would prove Maher's innocence, have gone missing (Monaco police say the video system was not working). And Maher's wife Heidi, argues that her husband's legal defence is compromised because it is state-appointed. 'The Monaco government is paying Ted's lawyer, Mr Blot, which is clearly a conflict of interest,' she has said. In fact, that is common legal practice, and indeed a human right, in most countries on occasions when the accused cannot afford a lawyer. Yet while Monaco is not implicated in a cover-up, there is a sense that it is actively presenting an untroubled face to the world. </p> <p>This is not the first time that a banker's death has caused a scandal in the region. Back in 1990, Jean Ferry, an official of the Industrial Bank of Monaco (BIM), was found dead from a bullet wound in the head. The police decided it was suicide, but a subsequent investigation found that a client of Ferry had constructed a large-scale fraud involving BIM. It also discovered that lax practices encouraging foreign tax evasion were endemic within the Monaco banking system. The most common method exploited a law which enabled foreign investors to create 'shell' companies in the names of Monegasque citizens (for a small payment). It has often been alleged that the system is abused by organised crime. </p> <p>Roger Bianchini, a journalist with Nice-Matin , told an author of a book on the Grimaldis: 'The whole system is well known to the initiated. But when underground deals begin to surface and scandal breaks through, Prince Rainier becomes concerned that the image of the principality could be tarnished.' </p> <p>As with other wealthy climes, such as Beverly Hills, the very sheen of Monaco's surface leads the visitor to suspect some form of moral corruption lurking underneath. The old wedding-cake architecture that survives is placed in the shade by the huge apartment-block developments that Rainier green-lighted in the 60s, creating an odd combination of sickly innocence and brash confidence. Although there is a refreshing sea breeze and the streets are neurotically clean, the faintest smell of pollution hangs in the air alongside the sweet fragrance of jasmine. And there is a disturbing sense that no amount of money will wash it away. </p> <p>For all its publicity-seeking glamour, Monaco thrives on secrecy. The government and its institutions, such as the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Bains de Mer, which runs the casino and hotels and much else, and which are all essentially arms of the Grimaldi empire ruled by Prince Rainier, are unapologetically opaque. Bankers may be attracted to secrecy, but so are storytellers. One of the more fanciful ideas doing the rounds has it that the Grimaldi grip on Monaco includes extensive telephone tapping based on a word-trigger system. 'If you said something derogatory about a Grimaldi it would undoubtedly hit the trigger,' suggests one observer. </p> <p>Against this backdrop of fantasy, any explanation of events provided by Monaco, the so-called Disneyland Dictatorship, would never be seen as the whole story. And indeed there are inconsistencies. Even Safra's widow's lawyer, Marc Bonnant, was concerned to ask that all the evidence be made available. </p> <p>'We would like to have all the details of the nurse's confession. Was it credible and complete, what exactly pushed him to do what he did, how many fires did he set, are there any inconsistencies in his confession? A thousand questions come to mind which need answers to make any sense out of this tragic and absurd death.' </p> <p>Among those questions, perhaps, are why did Safra remain in the bathroom even after the police arrived and why did it take two long hours for the fire brigade to get inside the bathroom? And why is it that Maher is said to have started only one fire and yet investigators located two separate origins? </p> <p>In early official reports it was stated - unambiguously by assistant prosecutor Le Lay - that Lily Safra did not speak to her husband during his confinement in the bathroom, that she was asleep. Elsewhere there were reports that she had spoken to him on a mobile phone. Bonnant told me, 'Edward Safra spoke twice to his wife, to his bodyguard and to the police.' Then why did he not emerge from the bathroom? Bonnant says that everyone was still under the impression that two armed intruders were in the building, which is also why the fire brigade made slow progress. </p> <p>But given the police presence and his own security guard, Safra must have been paralysed with fear not to feel confident enough to come out. Who did he think was after him? Bonnant is quick to scotch any talk of assassins. 'Look, if you want to kill a man, you pay $20,000 and you get the job done the right way by a professional. The right way is not to hire a nurse to start a small fire and hope that the police take two hours to get to him.' An insider on Maher's defence team echoes this point. 'People have told me they know for sure that Safra was shot with two bullets. Now the defence is going to see the inside of the building and we've asked for further fire reports and to look at video film outside the home. It might be that we'll see two guys in balaclavas on top of the roof, but I don't think so. And you have to ask, why were there no holes in Ted's clothes where his wounds were? Did the intruders thoughtfully lift up his shirt before stabbing him?' </p> <p>Handelman also dismissed the idea that Russians were behind Safra's death. 'It just wasn't their MO. Not outside Russia. Most people thought Safra was holding IOUs or money for the mafiya, but they wouldn't have killed him for that.' But he added: 'You can always be surprised.' </p> <p> After Maher's confession was made public, people began to ask how Safra had ever come to employ a man with such evident psychological problems. Suddenly it was common knowledge that Maher had a prescription-drug problem - according to Serdet - a history of violence and unstable personality traits. His colleagues at Columbia-Presbyterian countered these stories and provided an image of a reliable and motivated worker. 'He was really on top of things,' said one paediatrician. 'In fact, he was one of the better nurses I've seen.' </p> <p>Bonnant has said that Maher was properly vetted through 'in-depth background checks', as well as being interviewed by Safra himself. 'The fact that Maher is unstable became apparent to us only after the accident. Nothing in Maher's files showed the slightest trace of mental instability.' Perhaps because it wasn't there. </p> <p>Some newspaper articles quoted a former neighbour who quarrelled with Maher. 'He was a miserable bastard,' said 70-year- old Leonard Levelle, who accused Maher of physical assault. According to Maher's defence, Levelle himself was cautioned a number of times by the police. Much was also made of Mayer's leaving the Las Vegas police force after only three months. His defence say he quit because he contracted spinal meningitis. </p> <p>So was it a bizarre aberration? 'The reality of the situation is not something Ted can articulate,' say his defence. But the same source believed Maher was under pressure because his wife wanted him to return home and he wanted to stay in Monaco. </p> <p>What even his detractors agree on is that Maher never intended to kill Safra. 'If he wanted to,' said Serdet, 'he would have had 10,000 chances a day.' The fire simply got out of hand because he started it in an acrylic wastepaper basket. However, Maher is currently charged on a count of arson leading to death, a crime which carries a maximum life sentence. </p> <p>In his Monte Carlo office, high above the Boulevard des Moulins, Donald Manasse, an American-Frenchman who is assisting Georges Blot, told me, 'Ted is not guilty of the crimes as charged and we are seeking a requalification of the charges.' </p> <p>Optimistically, he might be looking at four to six years. But that's still a very severe sentence for what basically amounts to an accident. Bonnant demonstrated the Safra family's determination to gain what they see as justice. He told me: 'We want to ensure that the one who caused this will be properly punished.' </p> <p>The trial is unlikely to come to court until early next year. The investigating judge, Patricia Richett is still conducting her inquiry. Given the profile and importance of Safra, and the sensitivity of the Monaco authorities, fears have been expressed by those close to Maher that the investigation might be partial. Manasse was certain that Richett would not succumb to external pressure from any direction. 'Anyone who would say she could be influenced by third parties,' he told me, 'has no idea who she is.' </p> <p>Maher, it seems, does have one influential supporter himself. Dominic Dunne, the celebrated Vanity Fair writer and crusader against criminal injustice, is known to be sympathetic towards his plight. And the Monegasques have taken due notice. 'When Serdet heard that Dunne was arriving in Monaco,' a legal source said, 'he was practically saying, \"We've got to get this right, Dominic Dunne is coming to town.\"' </p> <p>In the meantime, Maher, the man who wanted to gain attention, is locked up in a prison that dare not speak its name, removed from his Mediterranean idyll, but tantalisingly trapped a few feet from the sea. He has no visitors, save his lawyers and the American consulate representative, and of course the tourists passing unknowingly by on their way to see a different Monte Carlo story. </p> <p>Life in Monaco continues as ever in its own secretive way. On a brilliant morning with seagulls circling overhead and the roar of the Monaco Kart Cup ripping around the bay, I stopped outside 17 Avenue D'Ostende. The fire damage is now mostly repaired, and just to be certain, I asked a policeman where Monsieur Safra had lived. He looked at me with a thin smile and said, ' Je ne sais pas.' Then he walked away. </p> <p>After Safra's burial, Eli Wiesel said of the close friend he often called his brother: 'After all, what remains of a man after his death? It is his name, his reputation, his honour.' And, a less circumspect man might have added, his money. Already there is talk of family disputes about where it will go. And there will continue to be talk about the banker from Beirut. For if Ted Maher started the fire, there was always smoke around Edmond Safra.</p>",
  "Michael is the godfather of my six-year-old daughter. When she was a few months old, he was one of the few people we trusted to be able to care for her. We would go out to the cinema or for a quick meal and he would be completely unfazed by her evening sessions of colicky crying, singing to her so that she was always fast asleep when we arrived home. Since then, he has often looked after both our children, acting as a child minder when I had to work, or as a wonderful baby-sitter in the evenings. <p>So I was surprised to learn from Michael that his sister-in-law wouldn't agree with me. She considers him incapable of caring for children and she has forbidden him from looking after or taking his nephew out alone. Not because of any suspected deviancy or substance dependency, you understand, but because he has a epilepsy. </p> <p>The term epilepsy covers the many different types of seizure that are caused by a temporary state of abnormal activity within differing parts of the brain. It is important to note the word 'temporary', because epilepsy is not considered to be an illness or a disease any more than, say, a migraine. Though to be diagnosed as having epilepsy (the tendency to suffer repeated seizures) has a more profound impact on a person's life than a migraine. This is not only illustrated by Michael's sister-in-law's fears but by my willingness to ignore his epilepsy because most of the time he seems to. </p> <p>Although I have never witnessed Michael having a seizure in the 10 years I've known him, I have seen him afterwards with a bruised and bloody face and a painful, swollen tongue that can make it difficult to eat or sleep. Michael is not a whinger, and like most people with epilepsy does not want to be defined by his condition (he does not like being called 'an epileptic'). But when he told me about his sister-in-law's alarmist attitude, I couldn't help wondering if I hadn't perhaps been too relaxed - it crossed my mind that the unpredictability of epilepsy and the fact that it is often alarming to witness should have put me off asking Michael to care for my kids. I decided I needed to know more. </p> <p>Epilepsy is a neurological condition. The brain has tens of millions of neurones, each connected to about 6,000 other neurones. When the brain is functioning normally, thousands of neurones fire (that is, give out a burst of electrical energy), transmitting information from cell to cell. Their activity is usually well organised, but sometimes - and this is what happens with epilepsy - the brain becomes too excitable and this super-excitability leads to areas going out of control, with many cells firing together. </p> <p>These bursts of abnormal firing activity can last from seconds to minutes, and then the brain returns to its normal functioning state. While the discharge lasts, it causes a temporary change in our emotions, consciousness, intellect or behaviour, which is known as a seizure or 'fit', although the term 'fit' is now rarely used by people with epilepsy because it is seen to have negative connotations with uncontrollable anger, as in 'don't tell them or they will have a fit'. </p> <p>Anyone might have a seizure, and in fact one in 20 people will have a major one during their life, but two thirds of those who have a single seizure will never have another one. Seizures can be the result of disease, injury, birth trauma, brain infection (such as meningitis or encephalitis), brain tumour, stroke, as well as drug or alcohol abuse and withdrawal. A tendency to seizures may develop for no obvious reason, though, or there may possibly be an inherited predisposition. </p> <p>The clinical diagnosis is made by a neurologist on the basis of the patient having more than one epileptic seizure (an accurate eyewitness account is often asked for). An EEG (electroencephalogram) is a special test that records brain waves and can provide useful information, particularly about types of seizure. CT and MRI brain scans can assess if there is an underlying cause or damage to the brain itself. </p> <p>Michael has been diagnosed as having 'tonic clonic' seizures ('I know it sounds like something I used to drink in Soho,' he says, 'but that is what they tell me'), or what used to be called 'grand mal'. This kind of seizure is probably what most people imagine when they think of epilepsy, although there are many different types and syndromes. First, he falls to the ground unconscious and his arms and legs go straight and rigid, his mouth clenches tight and the whole body is stiff. Then the muscles start to jerk in unison, starting at a rate of once every four to six seconds, and then stopping after a matter of minutes. </p> <p>Michael comes to some time later with no memory of what has happened, and if the seizure has occurred outside his home, he often finds himself either with a crowd around him or in an ambulance. If he is alone, he is not always aware that he has had a seizure. 'Recently, I went to buy some milk from the newsagent's,' he says. 'And wondered why the man behind the counter was looking at me in such a horrified way. When I got home, I looked in the mirror and saw that I had cut my head and had blood dripping down my face. Afterwards, there is a terrible pressure in my head and I have often bitten my tongue. I feel battered.' </p> <p>Dostoevsky wrote of the aftermath of his own epilepsy: 'After every attack, I cannot collect my thoughts for four days_ my memory seems to have gone.' It was not only his memory that suffered after each attack, but he was also overwhelmed by 'a feeling of terrible guilt', just as if he had committed 'some dreadful crime'. Michael says that he does not suffer from guilt, but rather humiliation and shame. Dostoevsky wrote, too, of a sense of euphoria before a seizure, which others describe as an 'aura'. Michael never used to have this but does now describe the sensation of 'slowing down; an odd sucking-out of sensation and a deadly calmness'. </p> <p>Michael suffered a frontal lobe injury in a car accident when he was 10. Ten years later, he had his first fit and in the last 20 years he has tried eight different types of anti-epileptic drugs to control and reduce his seizures. (No drug, however, can guarantee you will never have another fit.) </p> <p>One of the things Michael most loathes about epilepsy is the side effects of the drugs that he has to take twice daily because 'there is a dulling of the senses and a terrible sluggishness'. Professor John Duncan, medical director of the National Society for Epilepsy and professor of neurology at University College London, agrees: 'For some people with epilepsy, the side effects can include having the edge taken off concentration and a pervasive tiredness. For those who are having seizures at a rate of, say, once a year, it might be worth carefully considering lowering the dose of anti-epileptic drugs, even if it means more frequent seizures. For some, it might be worth the trade-off.' </p> <p>I know that Michael has got fed up with the effects of the drugs before, but has then been taken aback by the intensity of the seizures when he has tried to ease off them. He is now convinced of the necessity of taking them regularly. 'For years, I used all sorts of euphemistic terms such as \"my blackouts\", which was a sort of denial. Even now, I tend to overcompensate by being as lively and enthusiastic as I can but, of course, the thought that you might have a seizure at any time and without any real warning is pretty incapacitating. You can feel marginalised, and because it is a brain thing, I know that it has certainly affected my personal relationships. Epilepsy is considered to be mysterious and terrifying by an awful lot of people.' </p> <p>For a very few people with epilepsy (about 1,000 a year), the seemingly drastic measure of surgery is taken. If seizures begin on one side of the brain, occur frequently and can not be brought under control with two or, at most, three anti- epileptic drugs, or if there is shown to be a single abnormality in just one region of the brain, surgery can be seen as a 'cure'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, I will be lucky to book Michael in for baby-sitting at the moment. Two of my friends have asked if he would consider looking after their young children, because they have seen how great he is with mine. Like me, they know how hard it is to find someone as reliable, trustworthy and easy-going as Michael and feel that ultimately it is his sister- in-law's loss. Still, I am glad to have discovered more about such a close friend's condition - in the unlikely event that I will be with him during a seizure, I will at least have a greater understanding of what is going on. </p> <p> <b> Helping hands: What to do if someone has a seizure</b> </p> <p>Most epileptic fits demand no action on the part of the bystander. Even a tonic clonic convulsion is not a medical emergency, although it is frightening to watch, especially if you have never seen one before. Don't try to restrain the movements of the person having the seizure. You may need to move them gently, if they are in immediate danger (near an open fire or water). Otherwise, simply move any pieces of furniture so that there is a clear space around them, or put padding round any immovable objects that might cause injury.</p> <p>Never try to force the person's mouth open or wedge anything between their teeth. They will not choke during the fit, and although there is a small risk of them biting their tongue there is a much greater risk that you will break a tooth trying to prise their jaws apart. Undo any tight clothing around the person's neck, if you can do so easily, and put something soft under their head. Once the violent movements of the convulsion have stopped, gently turn the person on to their side into the recovery position, so that their breathing will not be obstructed while they are unconscious. Let the person wake up naturally, if they are sleeping. If the convulsions last for more than five minutes, or if another fit begins immediately, call for an ambulance telling them that the person is in status epilepticus.This is an emergency situation, so make sure that the person's airway is clear, put them in the recovery position, if this is possible, and stay with the person until the ambulance arrives.</p> <p><b>More information</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.epilepsy.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">British Epilepsy Association</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.epilepsynse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">National Society for Epilepsy</a></p>",

  "Given the choice, the public chose Sainsbury's. Offered its pick of every new building in the land, it turned its back on the austere reconstruction of Tate Modern, on the pomo funfairness of the London Eye and on the steel-and-glass clich\u00e9s of a hundred Lottery-funded arts centres. Instead, when - for the first time - we the people were asked to make our selection for the Stirling Prize, our most prestigious architecture competition, we plumped for Sainsbury's. <p>Not any old Sainsbury's, but the new one just down the road from the Dome and across the Thames from Norman Foster's Canary Wharf Tube station - which came second in the people's vote by just one vote. (For the record, I cast my vote for Southwark Tube station. The final victor will be announced next Saturday evening, when the great, the good and the dinner-jacketed will gather in front of the cameras of Channel 4 to announce - live! from the Wellcome Wing of the Science Museum! - the winner of this year's glittering prize.) </p> <p>It's an eco-friendly branch of 'the nation's favourite supermarket', with all clever kinds of stuff built into it - natural lighting balanced by computer-controlled louvres on top, wind-and-solar-powered totem signs out front and 75m-deep boreholes down below to run the cooling system. I tried it out, did a house shop there on a Thursday lunchtime - \u00a371.43 for 29 items, including half a dozen decent oysters (\u00a32.94), a double pack of apple and mango juice (\u00a33.49) and a Savoy cabbage (99p). On the way out, I splurged a ridiculous \u00a32.90 on a venti mocha frappuccino at the inhouse Starbucks. I was, in short, everyshopper for the afternoon. </p> <p>Designed by the previously obscure firm Chetwood Associates, it's a fine addition to Sainsbury's long association with proper architecture - Samantha Hardingham's guide to recent English architecture lists four branches, not including Nick Grimshaw's masterfully brutish one in Camden Town. The Greenwich store is already the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors building of the year. It's elegant, clever and good at the important bit of its job - making your shop easy, calm and joyful. </p> <p>Its low profile and grassed-over, sloping walls make it look not at all unpleasantly Teletubbyish. The 'steel-framed, 280m radius, barrel-vault roof with integrated radiating northlight double-glazed strips' both gives a clear, soft light and has a wry zoomorphism to it - suggesting the skeleton of some giant prehistoric sea thing which got beached on the Greenwich peninsula when the North Sea retreated back towards the dodgems and whelk stalls of Southend. But it's still just a supermarket. Frankly, I think the voting public is trying to tell architects something here. In choosing it, we've clearly indicated a set of values about our built environment. In the hierarchy of architecture, its practitioners put monumentalism at the top of their totem pole. We prefer a wind-and-solar-powered shop sign on top of ours, it seems. </p> <p>Architects - in cahoots with their natural allies, princes, politicians and panjandrums - like to build on a giant scale. As a profession, they tend to give awards to the big dick (and fanny, if you include Canary Wharf Tube) stuff - skyscrapers, galleries, museums, bridges, town halls, law courts. We're saying we want good architecture on a more domestic scale and that we care most about the stuff round the corner - possibly because even the most culture-vulturish of us spends more time shopping for dinner than we do looking at paintings. </p> <p>Some of our big-name architects have found their own way of connecting their work with us and our taste for shopping. As fashion designers make their money from scent and household knick-knacks, so our architectural lords are starting to do the same. You might not be able to afford to have Richard Rogers design your house, but you can have him do your door knobs. Though Chetwood Associates has yet to develop its diffusion range, Nick Grimshaw, creator of the Eurostar terminal and the forthcoming Earth Centre in Cornwall, offers architectural ironmongery - handles and the like - via Allgoods. Foster Associates has a range of 15 different products, including shelving, storage systems and an Alessi table. Will Alsop, architect of another Stirling finalist, the Peckham public library, sells his paintings - \u00a33,000 for River of Dreams: Glasgow , from the Mayo Gallery in London's Cork Street. </p> <p>Nigel Coates even has his own shop, a possibly fitting excess for an architect whose work is best described - in the words of the narration to Babe 2: Pig in the City - as standing 'a little to the left of the 20th century'. While most of his profession has adhered to the Mies van der Rohe axiom 'less is more', Coates has always favoured the 'more is still not enough' approach. Doric columns, bits of old airplanes, coloured glass - all have a treasured place in his buildings. His Clerkenwell shop has a similarly magpie approach, offering T-shirts with his name on, bits of jewellery, models of his work and The Coates David Collection - soft furnishings and tchochkes inspired by Michelangelo. The 15cm by 18cm Bollox Bowl in polished aluminium has to be my personal favourite. </p> <p>Coates' recent architecture has had mixed fortunes. There was the Dome's Bodyzone, and the pop music centre in Sheffield - now closed. His one unalloyed success has been the extension to the Geffrye Museum in Shoreditch. What's in it? A shop, of course.</p>",
  "<p>I bought a Tricity Bendix cooker from Currys in April last year under an interest-free credit agreement with GE Capital.

GE reckons to work closely with retailers to keep communication seamless and insists procedures implemented in June prevent a breakdown happening today. It regards your experience as a 'regrettable lapse' in customer service.

I was surprised to read on the receipt that the money would not be available for a cash withdrawal until the third working day. </p> <p>Halifax explained that the envelope has to be opened and checked and they need to allow for bank holidays. This left me more bemused than angry but it is hardly plausible that they have many more bank holidays in Sheffield that we have in Lincoln. <br><strong>SD, Lincoln</strong> </p> <p>Blaming bank holidays is ridiculous because the time is measured in working days. </p> <p>Halifax says that when paying in cash over the counter, you can withdraw against it the following day but if you make a deposit through a cash machine on a Monday, you cannot withdraw any money till Thursday. </p> <p>It takes Halifax this long to check that you really did put as much in the envelope as you said and the cashier should have pointed out this drawback to you in the first place. </p> <p><strong> Fact finding the hard way</strong> </p> <p> Eight years ago I returned to teaching and went to top up my pension. </p> <p>Teachers Assurance persuaded me that my money would be better invested with them than with the Prudential, even though the Pru offered reduced costs to teachers.

Teachers Assurance says it rejected your complaint because, at that time, teachers' own schemes had to be taken with the main pension whereas a free-standing AVC could be activated separately if you left before age 60. </p> <p>This overlooks that you could retire early if the local authority agreed.

  "<p>Many couples may have shuddered when they heard this month about the sad case of widow Sadie Dalziel, whose damages following the death of her husband were reduced by \u00a3100,000 in a court case because he had been cheating on her. </p> <p>Jason Dalziel died in 1996, at the age of 26, when his motorbike collided with a car. His wife, now 30, had never suspected his infidelity until she found out he had been involved for a year with the woman who was the pillion passenger in the accident. Elizabeth Simpson survived the crash and provided more evidence of the fragility of the Dalziel marriage - because he had also proposed to her. </p> <p>Under existing law, Privilege Insurance, the car driver's insurer, was entirely within its rights to ask that the damages be reduced to the widow on the grounds that the marriage looked un-likely to last. The judge, who presided over the High Court hearing this month, Robert Moxon-Browne QC, was also acting in accordance with the law when he reduced Sadie Dalziel's payout by about 40 per cent because he believed the argument that the marriage was quite likely to fall apart. </p> <p>Although the Association of British Insurers claims the case is something of a one-off, many married couples may wonder what could happen to them in similar circumstances. Figures from the Office of National Statistics show that while 304,000 couples tied the knot in 1998, about 160,000 got divorced. With divorce rates of about 50 per cent, should we all be worried? </p> <p>The answer is probably yes. Even Mrs Dalziel's solicitor, David Faithful of Amery Parkes in Birmingham, accepts the basic law is very clear: 'The way the law stands at the mo-ment, judges are entitled to discount damages on the basis that there will be a divorce.' </p> <p>Faithful believes there could be many disputes of this type, although few go to court: 'These cases are very, very rare. It's a matter for insurers what tactics they adopt.' </p> <p>Fighting this sort of case is very expensive. It has cost Mrs Dalziel about \u00a310,000 and the issue of money is going to lie very heavily with her, a nursery nurse, when she decides in the next three weeks whether to appeal. </p> <p>There are two ways this sort of dispute could be treated more sympathetically. The first would involve a more un-derstanding view of marital strife by judges. Many experts believe infidelity is not a strong indicator of relationship breakdown. </p> <p>Family solicitor Mark Har-per of law firm Withers will not comment on the Dalziel case but asks: 'How can a judge make a decision as to whe-ther a marriage is likely to end just because there has been an affair? Many of my clients tell me of past affairs which have not led to the breakdown of the marriage. It is a very big assumption to say that the existence of another relationship would lead to the breakdown of the marriage. Who can make that judgment?' </p> <p>It seems as if many other legal and family experts agree. The Law Commission last year urged the government to change procedures so that damages would be reduced only if there were objective evidence of impending divorce, such as the start of divorce proceedings. </p> <p>The commission is charged with making recommendations for better law. About 70 per cent of its recommendations do eventually make it to the statute books. But the big problem is usually finding the political will for the allocation of parliamentary time. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Lord Chancellor's Department said: 'The issue is being looked at by officials - but there isn't yet a set date for publishing a definitive report.' </p> <p>So the status quo will prevail. Damages in these sorts of cases are set very clinically under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976. This legislation sets out the procedures for calculating 'dependency claims' - looking at how much the de-ceased earned, for instance, assuming that 75 per cent of the income went on maintaining the family, deducting the other 25 per cent from the claim, deducting the surviving spouse's income, calculating the life expectancy of the spouse and then making other deductions for possible divorce, poor promotion pros-pects or ill health of the deceased. </p> <p>Solicitor Anne Davies of law firm Vizards Staples &amp; Bannisters acts for insurance companies and believes the Dalziel case could become an important one. 'The judgment will be used in other cases where a wid-ow is claiming against third parties,' she says. 'There seems to have been a very substantial reduction for a risk that seems to be not particularly quantifiable.' </p> <p>Insurance lawyers will scrutinise the transcript of the judgement when it comes out - to see if other factors, such as Jason Dal- ziel's apparently poor promotion prospects in the army, also played a part in the discounts to the damages. </p> <p>The case has clear implications for other people who are killed through the negligence of others. As well as traffic accidents, it could apply to disputes over people killed in the workplace. But, says Davies, it has fewer implications for people with life policies, travel insurance policies and other direct contracts with insurance companies. 'I would want to look at the wording of a life policy, but normally there wouldn't be a deduction of this kind to a widow,' she says. </p> <p>The difference between the two types of case is that the Dalziel claim is against a third party, the driver of the car which killed her husband, someone whose liability to her was based on his negligence. But a claim on a spouse's insurance policy is one based on a very clear contract which sets out the basis for any claim. </p> <p>Could it be possible, however, for lawyers in cases of the Dalziel kind to force down damages payments on the grounds that one in two marriages is likely to fail? 'Even as a lawyer who de-fends insurance companies, I would find that an unpalatable argument,' says Davies. 'I don't think it would be accepted.' </p> <p>But we do not know what is happening in the cases settled out of court.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Toy story of long hours and faith in the catalogue</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dawson-and-son.com\">Dawson &amp; Son</a> <br> Saffron Walden, Essex </p> <p>Nigel Dawson founded a mail order company selling traditional wooden toys after he was made redundant two years ago. </p> <p>He found himself with a 'reasonable' sum of money, which he lived on, and took the chance to set up Dawson &amp; Son.

Years later, he lived from savings and worked with the luxury chocolate company, Wittamer, in Brussels.</p> <p>They started Druid Chocolates in 1996 in Dublin, selling to specialist shops and through their own website. Fortnum and Mason is the first shop outside Ireland to sell their wares. Their turnover this year is expected to be \u00a3250,000.</p> <p>Gareth says: 'It hasn't been an easy ride and it's hard in that you do work 16 or 18 hours a day and you don't get a wage at the end of the month. You know that you have to move forward but you're finding your way.</p> <p>'When Ana and I came back to Ireland in 1996 we hooked up with an enterprise development programme in Dublin. They gave us a free telephone and about \u00a385 per week. We used a kitchen in the enterprise centre, so we didn't have to worry about health requirements and we started selling chocolates at farmers' markets.</p> <p>'The chocolate arrives in 10 kilo bricks of chocolate from Belgium. We blend it with fresh Irish cream and butter, and it has its own distinctive taste. We chose the name Druid because it has Celtic and magical associations, and rolls off the tongue.</p> <p>'I'm still not drawing a full salary but I am earning more than I was earning as an underwriter in Ipswich, although that was five years ago. Now there are eight people on the payroll. About a year ago we knew that we had to start paying ourselves salaries and making profits. The only way to do that was by taking on help to free us up to develop the marketing.</p> <p>'Starting the business was a personal thing as well as a business thing. Going from insurance to chocolate is a funny transition.</p> <p>'Yet while people in chocolate tend to work hard and get stressed at Christmas, they're happy.'</p> <p>Ana says: 'When I met Gareth he started giving me chocolates he'd made himself - classic truffles, with cocoa powder on top. They didn't look very good, but I thought it was so romantic. We weren't happy with the jobs we were doing, and one day we suddenly said: \"Why don't we make them for other people?\" '</p> <p>'We had the spirit to do it. We looked under every stone for money and I didn't buy clothes for two years, but when you're busy doing what you want, nothing else matters.</p> <p>'I used to dream about chocolate but now I dream about finances. I've learnt expressions that I can't translate into Spanish, such as cash flow management. Our sales are growing. We employ six people and they're always coming up with new ideas.</p> <p>'In the beginning you work all the time, but now we're starting to have a life as well as a business.'</p> <p><strong>More than a job, less than a life </strong></p> <p>Number Seven Cafe and deli </p> <p>Liverpool </p> <p>0151 709 9633 </p> <p>Helen and Martin Ainscough are siblings and they set up Number Seven, a deli and cafe, five years ago. They now have two pubs, two restaurants and a catering business and next month they're opening Station, a cafe/restaurant/food emporium in Hamilton Square, in the historic Birkenhead area, part of the Hamilton Quarter Initiative regeneration programme. Their turnover is \u00a32.5 million.</p> <p>Helen says: 'It's enslavement! People imagine that it's really fantastic because you're your own boss and in control of your time but in reality you're not. I made sandwiches all day today because someone didn't turn up in the deli. There is a sense of achievement but there's a real downside to never being let off the hook.</p> <p>'In terms of salary, I pro-bably earn the same as I did when I was employed: about \u00a323,000 a year, but that's probably about \u00a32 per hour with the amount of hours I work! But I do have a company car and I never buy food because I'm never at home.</p> <p>'Since I started I haven't really had a holiday. I do feel knackered. I think it's bad in a way because I've become less sociable, although some of my work is really sociable and fun because we're entertaining people. I've been saying to Martin: \"I can't go on like this, working 18-hour days. I'd like to rebalance my life a bit and feel less enslaved.\" One good thing is that I'll have saved up enough to go to The Priory.'</p> <p>Martin says: 'When you run your own business, you have total freedom: you don't have to answer to anyone yet you're at the beck and call of the business 24 hours a day. I work from 8am until whenever each day, usually until 8pm but probably a bit later. I also work at weekends. As we get bigger, we're determined to lead a more normal life. I'm quite relaxed about it, but Helen worries a lot. She said that she woke up at five this morning, worrying about how we'll get through Christmas.</p> <p>'We were very lucky because we inherited some money so we've financed what we've done, although there was a big risk when we opened Number Seven and a lot of people thought we were mad. It is generating cash now but that's after five years. We pay ourselves a salary and we put a lot of money into a pension. We pay \u00a31 million a year in wages as we now employ 200 people, but a lot of them work part-time.</p> <p>'We bought Station, which is in a Regency building, for \u00a3150,000 and we'll probably spend half a million on it. We've got grants from English Heritage and the European Development Fund.</p> <p>'I'm not very good at managing people. Helen's very good at that. I want to keep people and keep them interested so it's all about staff development.</p> <p>'I would earn about five times as much if I were employed, but what I was doing before wasn't creative. Money isn't everything.'</p> <p><strong>Keeping their options open</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.working-options.co.uk\">Working Options</a> </p> <p>020 8932 1462 </p> <p>Working Options is a recruitment consultancy for part-time professionals, set up in January 1999 by Elaine Howe and Lindsay Swan, neighbours in Ealing, London. Elaine is an accountant and Lindsay used to run a PR company. They started Working Options with mothers in mind, but now have 2,000 candidates on their books - many of them men. Most want to work part-time because of children, but others are writing books, going to college,or retraining. Their turnover is 'a six-figure number - but not colossal'. This year they will double it.</p> <p>Elaine Howe says: 'What I love about it is the flexibility. The flipside is that it's in the home and it's very long hours. I stop work at about 5.30pm for the children but then at about 9pm I'm back at my desk until 11.</p> <p>'We're now at a point where we need to move the business to the next phase and with that will come the need for outside investment. That will feel different be-cause we'll have to answer to someone. It will have to be more structured. So far we've spent \u00a34,000 on advertising and \u00a36,000 on our website. We don't really take a salary at the moment.</p> <p>'Lindsay and I meet and talk all the time. I don't think I would have had the motivation to do it on my own. But we're a start-up in a growing market. Eighty per cent of the jobs that come in, we can fill. When we place someone, we take a percentage of two- fifths of a salary but we have to put in just as much effort to fill the position. It's a massive volume of administration. If we were in it purely to make money we'd be recruiting full-time positions.'</p> <p>Lindsay Swan says: 'When we first started we put in a few hundred pounds each but there weren't really many costs as I was already set up with a computer and a fax. We've saved a lot of money by not having an accountant and not paying for PR and marketing.</p> <p>'We've recently taken on a lawyer who is going to be our new business person. She works part-time. We also have someone doing ongoing research. We create our own mailing lists. In PR, you learn that you're only as good as your list.'</p> <p><strong>Open all hours for fun and exhaustion</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.trericket.co.uk\"> Trericket Mill guesthouse</a></p> <p>Builth Wells, mid-Wales </p> <p>Alistair and Nicky Legge bought Trericket Mill, on the River Wye, 13 years ago for \u00a3146,000. They've spent about \u00a3100,000 restoring it, and run it as a guesthouse with 16 beds and camping outside.</p> <p>Alistair, who studied stage management and worked for the Welsh National Opera, runs the guesthouse full-time. Nicky works part-time in the business and full-time running the Job Centre in nearby Brecon. They employ two part-time staff. They went into profit for the first time three years ago: they made \u00a36,000. Last year their profit was \u00a310,000 and they hope to make a little more this year.</p> <p>Alistair says: 'We'd been on holiday in the Greek islands and we'd been thinking: \"Wouldn't it be nice to run a taverna?\" We saw the mill for sale and made an offer. It was a spur-of-the- moment decision.</p> <p>'We paid too much for it, but we both had houses to sell. I don't know how much it's worth now: It probably didn't make sense spending so much money on it purely as a business prospect but it's our home as well.</p> <p>'The business is very erratic. It can be stressful. The strong pound means that people go abroad more. But now we're established, half of our custom is repeat business.</p> <p>'I think that if we started now we'd be struggling. We're still building the business. There is potential to do more food but we'd have to employ more people on a more permanent basis. At the moment we charge \u00a312 for a three-course evening meal. We're not a restaurant: you bring your own wine.</p> <p>'It's a pretty nice lifestyle if you accept that you're probably working most of your waking hours.'</p> <p>Nicky says: 'Alistair does all the maintenance and cooking and I do the books. What we earn is no more than Alistair could if he went out and got a full-time job.</p> <p>'Our life is a bit mad. We miss going out in the evenings and away at weekends. We always say: \"When there's no one in, we'll go out\", but we usually flop in front of the telly. We have our own flat on the top floor: it's our little bolt hole .</p> <p>'You have to see it as fun. It's quite exhausting. If we'd thought about it, we'd probably never have done it.'</p>",

She found Northern Ireland 'a great place to live', applied for a bursary to do a PhD and stayed a further three years. </p> <p>'When that finished, I got a job at University College, Dublin and worked there on a post-doctoral fellowship.' She is now a history lecturer with the University of Ulster. She loves the life but there is a problem: 'At the moment I am really struggling to cover all my outgoings. Even as a professional, I can't make ends meet.' </p> <p>Although she did not get a proper job until she was nearly 29, she had no student loans but, since starting work, has had to borrow heavily: 'I have accumulated all this debt since I bought my house. I didn't have any idea how expensive it was.' Interest rate rises pushed up repayments from \u00a3120 a month to \u00a3180. 'I think I probably should have kept renting for a while but you feel the pressure to get into the housing market. </p> <p>Particularly in Northern Ireland there was a concern that house prices had been artificially kept down and were going to sky-rocket.' Her other big expense is the car. One failed the MOT: 'So I changed the car rather than pour more money into it but that was probably the wrong thing to do.' Insurance had been costing \u00a330 a month, but for her new Honda Civic she pays \u00a3115 a month, partly because had also lost her no-claims bonus. </p> <p>She recently spent \u00a3200 getting the car fixed: 'I was in an accident and I'm trying to get a no-claims bonus this year, so I'm paying for the repairs myself.' She lives in a rural area and spends about \u00a380 a month on petrol: 'The recent increases in petrol prices have not helped.' </p> <p>All this has put pressure on her credit card: 'Usually, I use it when 'normal' money is awkward, like buying stuff over the internet or buying cheap petrol in the Republic. But at the moment I'm using my credit card for essentials like petrol and groceries.' She can afford to repay only the minimum amount each month. 'I'm trying to spend less on credit cards and I'm in the process of transferring my balance to two other, cheaper cards. </p> <p>She supplements her income by \u00a32,700 a year with part-time teaching for the Open University. She contributes \u00a348 a month to a Friends Provident free-standing AVC and \u00a3110 to the university pension. She contacted a local financial adviser but he did nothing: 'He said that nobody local dealt with my kind of situation, which I understood to mean that I needed help, but didn't want to buy anything.' </p> <p>She asks: 'Can you help? Or is the solution to get rid of the television and read the newspaper by candlelight?</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Donna Bradshaw</strong></p> <p>Janice already has good deals for her mortgage and personal loan but should check out cheaper car insurance and utilities. </p> <p>After paying her main expenses, she has \u00a3680 a month for utility bills, council tax, food, clothing, sundries, and paying off her credit card. This is a reasonable amount to live on so she probably has a problem budgeting.</p> <p>She should stop paying for petrol on the credit card as this just adds to the problem. Transferring her current credit card debt is a good idea and she should look for a card with a low interest rate that continues until the debt is cleared. Rates start from 5.9 per cent; standard rates may not be so great but if she pays off new purchases in full each month she will not incur further interest. She would do even better not using a credit card until she is out of the woods.</p> <p>Next she has to cut down on monthly outgoings and start clearing her credit card bill. She should write down absolutely everything that she spends for a month to see where the money is going and why she spends more than she earns.</p> <p>Janice might also be able to augment her income by car sharing to work or renting out a room in her house for up to \u00a34,250 a year tax-free. She should check her FSAVC as her employer's AVC scheme or added years could be more suitable. </p> <p>Donna Bradshaw works for London-based Fiona Price &amp; Partners. </p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Anna Bowes </strong></p> <p>At the moment Janice uses her credit card as a float and of course that builds up. She could ask if she can take a contribution holiday, for no more than one year, from the Friends Provident free-standing AVC as this is money that she just does not have at the moment. </p> <p>As the \u00a315,000 personal loan was for home improvements, she might add that to the mortgage. Spreading the repayments over a longer period dramatically cuts her outgoings and she will pay a lower rate of interest than on the personal loan.</p> <p>She could also add the credit card debt to her mortgage although this depends on the amount of equity she has in the property and she may feel this is building too much debt for the future. Reducing the mortgage payments and other outgoings should help her pay off the credit cards quite rapidly.</p> <p>She should shop around for a new credit card provider as this is a competitive market and new issues are being offered all the time.</p> <p>She could also research car insurance although there is likely to be a penalty for cancelling mid-term, so she may need to wait until the renewal date.</p> <p>After reinstating the free-standing AVC, she needs to start saving for a rainy day. Inevitably some big bill comes out of the woodwork at just the wrong time and the only way to deal with this comfortably is to have a float. </p> <p>Anna Bowes works for Bath-based Chase de Vere. </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only.</p> <p>\u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

  "<p>Take two founders of a dotcom company. Overnight one becomes a celebrity while the other languishes in the background, despite the fact that he is the senior of the two. She becomes something of an icon to the City while he is still able to shop in Tesco without being recognised. </p> <p>'It's interesting to reflect on the attention given to Lastminute.com, says Professor John Quelch, dean of London Business School (LBS). 'Martha Lane Fox got much more press coverage than Brent Hoberman, which suggests there was something more unique about her in the minds of the media than him. It's a reflection of the problem facing women in business.' </p> <p>The depressing fact is that, despite all the talk of closing gender gaps over the last few years, men still wear the trousers in the business world. The few women like Lane Fox who have made it to the top of the tree are seen as freaks, which serves only to reinforce stereotypes and, ultimately, exacerbate the corporate gender divide. </p> <p>LBS is so concerned at the lack of senior female executives that later this week it will hold a high-profile conference - 'Breaking the Mould' - in an attempt to attract more women to the university and into the business world at large. Only 22 per cent of the school's students are women, reflecting the fact that they form less than a quarter of those who apply. It is a statistic common to business schools nationwide. </p> <p>Quelch says: 'If you take a profession like medicine or the law, you find women have broken through. About 50 per cent of the people in these two are women. Even in engineering women are making headway. But in business...' </p> <p>Indeed. The facts are overly familiar. Only one woman - Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of Pearson - heads a FTSE 100 company. Less than 5 per cent of non-executive positions in those companies are held by women. Last week a comprehensive report into executive pay by the research company Incomes Data Services showed that in this financial year a female FTSE 350 director could expect to receive total earnings - including bonuses and share options - of \u00a3261,000. Her male counterpart, however, would be in line for a package just shy of \u00a3400,000. </p> <p>Even in the US, seen as home to a more enlightened business culture than the old boy network represented in the Square Mile, there seem few grounds for optimism. An exhaustive study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which analysed US salary data between 1992 and 1997, showed that women executives earned one-third less than men over the same period: $900,000 compared with $1.3 million - although the differentials were heavily skewed by disparities in age and experience. Even so, it is still a fact that less than 5 per cent of women reach the most senior executive positions in American companies. </p> <p>But the UK seems to be one of the worst offenders when it comes to top jobs for the boys. Success stories are few and far between. Scardino does, after all, hail from the US. The UK's second highest-profile businesswoman, Barbara Cassani, chief executive of BA's low-cost airline Go, is also from over the pond. A recent edition of Fortune magazine was big on female high-flyers in the US - as you would expect - but it also waxed lyrical about French and Japanese businesswomen. The UK was, with the exception of Scardino, sadly lacking. </p> <p>The entrenched patriarchal structure of the business world might make for a cosy club, but it doesn't make for strong corporate performances, according to Quelch. This is because the new, knowledge-based economy places much greater emphasis on the need to create enduring working relationships between companies. More and more companies are sharing information, brands and personnel, calling for new management skills. </p> <p>'The types of challenges facing businesses today are often about managing joint ventures or strategic partnerships. It's not about being a bull in a china shop like the old days. The competitiveness of the UK economy depends on it leveraging the talents of its people and obviously there are demands for people with these sorts of management skills,' Quelch says. </p> <p>Elizabeth Coffey, author of The Changing Culture of Leadership: Women Leaders' Voices, agrees with Quelch's analysis. She studied 50 of the top businesswomen in the UK and compared their styles of leadership with their male counterparts. </p> <p>'Women are much more into developing learning cultures. They'll create teams rather than divisions and hierarchies,' says Coffey. </p> <p>It might sound New Age mumbo jumbo to the pinstriped brigade but Coffey argues that companies will have to start taking such cultures far more seriously in the future. 'Companies will start to pay more attention to this when they ask \"who are our customers?\" Customers are increasingly female.' </p> <p>Indeed they are, and it's not just in the obvious conventional retail departments that women are making the purchasing decisions. Four-fifths of all car-buying decisions are made or influenced by women. A survey in the US found that nearly 60 per cent of all car tyre purchases were made by women. </p> <p>'Companies need to understand how their customers think. That's a primary driver for setting up these learning cultures, so they know how to react,' Coffey says. </p> <p>The trend to outsourcing is also having an effect. Anna Lloyd, of the Committee of 200, a US society for leading businesswomen, says: 'The market place is demanding a different perspective in relationships. A lot of tasks are now outsourced and consultants are doing everything on the payroll. Managers have to interact differently. The old ways of managing things are changing.' </p> <p>But, even if this argument holds water, few companies so far give it credence. 'There is still a lot of prejudice against women around. Companies are more aware that they need women in senior posts and they may appoint some more, but does that mean they're just token gestures?' asks Bronwyn Curtis, managing director of Bloomberg TV and Radio in Europe. </p> <p>Curtis, who was a few years ago the former chief economist at Japanese bank Nomura - still the only woman to have held such a position at a high-profile finance house - is cynical about the future. 'It [the gender gap] is better than when I started in the City in 1987, but I don't think you'll see drastic changes in the next five years. Maybe in the next 10 to 15, but it will take a new generation of men to change it.' </p> <p>All of the women interviewed by The Observer for this article stressed that men's support will be crucial if women are to break through the glass ceilings of tomorrow. Even at the domestic level this seems vital. Coffey cited research which showed that nearly three-quarters of leading businesswomen claim to have supportive husbands who are sympathetic to their job commitments. </p> <p>One day we may be saying 'Behind every great woman...' but don't hold your breath. </p> <p><strong>The gender gap</strong></p> <p>Women may be finding it difficult to break into the upper echelons of the UK's largest companies but at least there are grounds for optimism in the wider business world. Today, women hold three times as many managerial roles as they did a decade ago, according to a recent report by the Institute of Management. </p> <p>The report also found that women are closing the gender pay gap. Typically, male managers are paid 8 per cent more than their female counterparts, compared with 38 per cent more a decade ago. Over the past year women managers' pay rose by 6.4 per cent compared with the 5.4 per cent rise received by their male counterparts. </p> <p>In addition, more women are now making it into the boardroom. Nearly 10 per cent of companies now boast a woman on their board compared with just under 2 per cent 10 years ago. </p> <p>There is also evidence that women are becoming more entrepreneurial. More than a third of all business start-ups are formed by women. In the US the figure is even more dramatic. Female-owned businesses are the fastest area of business growth in the US, according to the Centre for Policy Alternatives. These businesses now employ one in four of the working population.</p>",
  "<p>We all saw the pictures. The deep eye sockets. The streamline features. The gleaming cranium, radiating energy in the glare of his own NBC television lights. We heard the shoot-from-the-hip lingo as he explained how he just snapped together that $45 billion deal between his turbine to twin-tub combine General Electric and industrial controls group Honeywell, in three days. </p> <p>He told us how a tip from a reporter led him to fax Honeywell's chairman nine days' ago and close a deal gazumping his rival United Technologies the following day. As a result of this masterstroke he's putting off his retirement. But, hey, he's taking the risk: his family has only company stock to live on. He's not doing it because he's an old man who can't let go. To anyone who disagrees, he says: 'I want to take them on right in the chops'. </p> <p>How do you describe a man like Jack Welch? 'A dynamo,' says one expert. 'A connoisseur of talent,' says another. </p> <p>'We call him The Penguin,' says one less enamoured engineering firm that has to compete with him rather than lecture about him. 'Tell me if he does not look like Batman's biggest headache. The problem is he has that effect on the competition.' </p> <p>Welch unnerves people. One official at aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce says: 'One of our executives once asked Jack at a conference what he though Rolls should do. 'Just stay in big engines,' he said. 'Our people spent a while puzzling out whether this was good advice, or if he was trying to get one over on us.' </p> <p>He unnerves for a reason. Though he talks macho, synergies with Honeywell worth $1.5 billion were 'right in the gunsights' - he delivers. </p> <p>General Electric is the first and last word in conglomerates. He has built it from the $13bn company he took over in 1981 into the world's biggest company, worth $530 billion. </p> <p>It has 340,000 employees - 465,000 after the latest merger - in 100 countries, with revenues of $111.6 bn. It sells everything from light bulbs to dishwashers and ovens, to electrical switchgear, aero engines and financial services. </p> <p>At 64, Welch's raw energy remains famous. One of his better known sobriquets is Neutron Jack - a phrase that gets close to the heart of the man: he destroys whatever gets in the way of what he wants to build. He is charismatic and competitive and has great charm, according to those who have met him. He has judgment - GE is as much about successful delegation as it is about Welch himself - and he is canny. </p> <p>'All that nonsense about him depending on the success of the deal,' says another competitor. 'He has been getting millions in bonuses. But it's typical Welch: he knows some people will believe it, and he knows they think he does.' Welch is the eighth highest paid US executive, says Forbes magazine . </p> <p>His upbringing is suspiciously close to the ideal American dream, an idea the old myth-maker does little to discourage. For example, a converted gravel pit in his native Salem, Massachusetts - requisitioned by local boys who ran it themselves because there were no state leisure facilities - was where his first fist fights and ball games were played out. Naturally, he rose to the top. </p> <p>But for the record, he was born the only son of a railway conductor. His father was often away from home so he was raised by his ambitious mother. </p> <p>Welch was not shy about ambition himself. He had an accomplished spell at Salem High school, where he was co-captain of golf - he is still very keen - played hockey, and held the post of treasurer. </p> <p>His teachers said in his college yearbook: 'A keen wit, a wise look and an answer always ready.' Welch said in the school literary magazine: 'repressed desire - to make a million.' </p> <p>He went to the University of Massachusetts for a degree in chemical engineering, followed by a Phd at the University of Illinois. </p> <p>He joined GE's plastics division in 1960. Plastics was a buzzing area, with new markets being developed. His career has perhaps come full circle. With the acquisition of Honeywell, GE's $250m plastics division gains critical mass. </p> <p>'Back then,' says one business analyst, 'he learnt you have to innovate ceaselessly to get margins.' </p> <p>Welch sped through GE. By 1981 he was joint chief executive and chairman. Jay Conger, professor of leadership at the London Business School, says one of the keys to Welch was spotting defining new trends and remodelling the business around them. 'Control your destiny or die,' he said. </p> <p>His first initiative was to force the company's operations to focus at being number one or number two in its market. If it wasn't it had to get there. If it couldn't, it would go. This not only refocused the business - hundreds of underperforming operations went - it refocused management and weeded out those who weren't up to scratch. </p> <p>He called his next move 'speed, simplicity, self confidence'. Welch viewed the GE bureaucracy - an industrial civil service - with suspicion. So he smashed it, gaining that Neutron Jack tag. He thinned out divisions, fired thousands of staff, shed layers of management. Each division would be a business 'laboratory', creating ideas and deciding the best way of making money from them. </p> <p>Late in the Eighties Welch latched onto globalisation, which he called 'boundarylessness'. GE needed to think globally about everything from labour markets, suppliers and customers to business practice, generating its own ideas and taking them from others. </p> <p>On top of this it created businesses such as a leasing and financial services division, which made its own products such as aero-engines more easily available. This division now generates $55.75bn of revenue. He realised margins were in servicing engines, not manufacturing them, so bought independent aero engine workshops around the world. </p> <p>GE has faced challenges throughout - such as the Kidder Peabody financial scandal, which saw a rogue trader lose the financial services arm millions - and some observers have criticised the increasing dominance of financial services. But to his admirers, Welch's success has depended on meeting problems, such as the internet, head on. His response to that? 'destroyyourbusiness.com', an initiative to show top managers that the Net was do or die for GE. The group claims it has already gained $5bn from online operations. </p> <p>He has faced criticism for it. Last year, for example, Forbes hinted that Welch might be a dinosaur thrashing about in a new age when he refused to link the pay of young webmeisters he had brought in to the profits of their operations. The young things began to defect to dotcoms. Welch was allegedly furious - but who's laughing now? </p> <p>For Jay Conger there's more to Welch than the corporate engineer. 'Jack Welch is one of the great dealmakers. People know they are facing the quickest mind in business. But there is more than that - they know they are dealing with one of the world's only business celebrities. Welch knows he's going to do a good deal for GE, and so do they.' Thus far it seems self fulfilling - the 1,700 acquisitions under Welch have created GE as a savvy and agile conglomerate. </p> <p>There are sceptics, particularly over Honeywell. One UK analyst says: 'This could be the mark of an organisation looking for places for its capital. The big question isn't whether Honeywell's a great fit - it isn't perfect - but whether it indicates GE running out of steam. Was it the big man's last gambit?' </p> <p>Honeywell will almost certainly be his swan song. True to form he has managed his succession - picking candidates and designing the selection process. But will he choose the right man? And has he left a structure that they can build on? </p> <p>'You wait to see what comes out of the woodwork when he's gone,' says another analyst. 'There's a lesson from the UK. Remember that famously autocratic and successful British boss Lord Weinstock. Do you remember what his company was called?' </p> <p>Answers on a postcard. </p> <p><strong>Vital signs</strong></p> <p><strong> Subject: </strong> John F Welch Jr </p> <p><strong> Age: </strong> 64 </p> <p><strong> Job: </strong> Chairman and chief executive, General Electric </p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> Golf, baseball, competing </p> <p><strong>Sayings of chairman Jack</strong></p> <p>'We will only be number one or two or else we will sell it, fix it or close it.' </p> <p>'Companies can't give job security. Only customers can.' </p> <p>'Muscle is the answer. When you have 10 diverse businesses, you have 10 popgun stalls. When they are constructed into one entity that can really do the job, that gives you muscle.' </p> <p><strong>Anatomy of a giant</strong></p> <p>Jack Welch may seem like a big deal, but even his stature is dwarfed by the company he runs. General Electric is an American industrial institution. Its origins go back to the 1878 foundation of the Edison Electric company, which turned into GE in 1892. The company history reads like a chronicle of US industrial progress. </p> <p>Between 1882 and 1968 it built the US's first central power station, launched its domestic appliance company, created the RCA radio corporation, entered commercial aircraft engine manufacture, opened the first licensed nuclear power plant and pioneered consumer, commercial and industrial credit and leasing. </p> <p>But while the company's life blood has been building industrial businesses across many sectors of US business, its brains, particularly since Welch became a vice president in the Seventies, have been deployed as one of the country's most astute corporate operators. </p> <p>Under Welch GE has become a deal-making machine - to the tune of some 1,700 acquisitions. Indeed, Welch cited his skills at bedding in deals, particularly the 1985 acquisition of the RCA media business, as the main reason for staying on. </p> <p>In 1981 GE moved into semiconductors, buying Intercil. In 1983 it consolidated its position in medical scanning technology through acquisition. </p> <p>A string of deals since then has built GE Capital Services into a massive consumer credit, industrial and commercial financing and leasing operation which dominates the business - some would say too much so. </p> <p>Welch has also pursued other strategies by acquisition, for example backing his belief in the margins of servicing rather than building aero-engines by buying BA's operations in Wales in 1991 and Greenwich Air services and UNC in 1997. </p> <p>He's also bought into mobile phones - a joint venture with Ericsson in 1991 - and snapped up operations that fit with the companies earliest origins, such as Thorn EMI's light bulb business in 1991. </p> <p>He has also jettisoned extraneous operations, such as non financial broadcasting, oil and gas exploration and problematic operations such as Kidder Peabody financial business. </p> <p>One disposal, made in 1970 when he had been at the company 10 years, may have caught his eye. In that year GE sold its mainframe computer business to Honeywell. Last week's deal brings the business back to GE. </p> <p>But the world is split over whether Jack's done well on this one. Initial reaction from the markets was twitchy - GE's value dropped by about 4.8 per cent. </p> <p>Analysts rallied, however, pointing to the strategic fit in aerospace, where GE's $10.6 billion of aero engine sales was matched by Honeywell's $10.5 billion cockpit avionics business. They also pointed to a broader customer base for GE's industrial systems brought by Honeywell's controls division. </p> <p>Welch himself defended the acquisition of the chemicals business, saying it bulked GE's $250m activities up by $1bn. </p> <p>He added that these are real technology businesses, with real earnings and real products - unlike the dotcoms - and pointed to real $1.5bn savings from the '90 per cent fit' of the businesses. </p> <p>In a Merrill Lynch note out on Wednesday analyst Jeanne Terrile says if GE successfully integrates Honeywell it could be the driver of GE's future growth when other businesses, like power, turn down. </p> <p>But the note is in awe of Welch: 'Fixing Honeywell will call upon a lot of GE's resources, but... GE has done this sort of thing before,' Terrile wrote.' She added: 'The deal seems so much (a) a Jack deal... and (b) will be the thing that investors focus on until it is done... that the succession story becomes much smaller.' </p> <p>With 3,000 miles perspective, UK analysts are not so sure. ABN Amro's Sandy Morris said: 'There are \"yesses\" about this. Perhaps Honeywell's automation will allow GE to develop its home products division, for example with fridges that can read barcodes and so on. But nobody has ever demonstrated to me that cockpits (Honeywell's Avionics) and engines (GE) have natural synergies. I'm sure if they had, people would have tried it. </p> <p>'That said, GE is a phenomenally powerful company with a phenomenal growth record. The question is, is this the best thing it can find to do with its capital, or is it a sign that the momentum is finally beginning to go?'</p>",
  "<p>First it was petrol. Next it was trains. Last week it was the turn of planes to prompt a crisis for the Government. Following in the wake of the Hatfield crash and the fuel protests that brought motorised Britain to a standstill, last Thursday saw its attempt to sell off 51 per cent of Britain's National Air Traffic Control System (Nats) rejected by the House of Lords . </p> <p>The vote to delay the sale until after the next election won all-party support and came a day after Tony Blair refused to back down on the public-private partnership policy. The Government has pledged to reverse the change in the Commons before sending it back to the Lords. </p> <p>Labour peer Lord Brett questioned the scheme's safety and disagreed with Blair that PPP was the only way to attract future investment in the system. Other ways - a public trust, for example - could do it without the 'conflict of interest' private firms might bring with them. </p> <p>Within the wider context of air traffic control the vote against the UK scheme - under which 5 per cent would be sold to staff - was seen by many in the industry as a blessing. There are two reasons for this. First, Nats was a UK-only solution and airlines and aircraft manufacturers are far more interested in programmes that integrate airspace over continents rather than compartmentalising them. Only in this way can the growing congestion in the skies be eased. </p> <p>Second, Nats paid little attention to the technological possibilities that a full modernisation of air traffic control systems should include. This, according to those who promote these solutions, is so as to ensure that the huge forecast increases in air travel can be controlled. </p> <p>The International Airline Trade Association (IATA) points out that air traffic volumes rise by 5 to 6 per cent a year, and double every 10 years. The worst affected parts are north-east US and Europe, where volumes have shot up. </p> <p>Airlines have been lobbying for change, particularly in Europe. Continental air traffic control systems are grossly inefficient, they contend. The reasons are partly political - individual states are loath to cede control of their airspace - and as a result Europe has more than 40 main traffic management centres to America's four. They are also technical - a plethora of different ground-based systems have grown up, sucking in investment. </p> <p>Reforms proposed by IATA include more co-operation between nations in managing pan-European airspace, rationalisation of the ATC centres, a co-ordinated strategy to create more capacity in the skies, and liberalisation - not privatisation - of ATC. Airlines are desperate for more capacity. But they believe a satellite future is some way off in Europe. </p> <p>'A solution can only be found by individual governments becoming co-operative, allowing others to operate through their airspace and not going out to pursue their own schemes for liberalisation or increasing capacity without co-ordination,' said a spokeswoman. Nats would clearly have failed on these criteria. </p> <p>Alongside the geographical and structural issues are technological ones. The UK, like other European countries, has invested billions in state-of-the-art radar control facilities. This, say some in the aerospace industry, is missing the point. There needs to be a generational leap in technology to a satellite-run system. </p> <p>The importance of technology depends on your future strategy. As far as the two major aircraft manufacturers are concerned, these could not be more different. Airbus sees the future in traffic-light mega-airliners such as its A3XX superjumbo, which can land 800 people a time at international hubs. The plane itself is part of the solution, thinning out the clutter of smaller aircraft. </p> <p>Boeing, on the other hand, sees the future in traffic-heavy 'fragmentation' - more smaller planes flying higher-value short-haul routes to airports closer to travellers' final destinations. Here the planes are part of the problem: contributing to a lack of airway capacity. </p> <p>As Boeing's chief operating officer, Harry Stonecipher, said last week at a meeting in London: 'The problem has got to be solved, otherwise growth in air travel slows, and that unpicks our company's airplane business.' </p> <p>Boeing considered bidding for Nats but decided against it. It gave two reasons: it was a UK-only project, while the future required a Europe-wide one and it was not technologically radical enough. Nats, said Stonecipher 'is not about a solution. It is about nothing more than privatisation'. </p> <p>At the meeting he announced that within a year Boeing planned to unveil a satellite-based scheme capable of total overhaul of air traffic control, managing it more efficiently than the current radar/satellite hybrids operating around the world and creating 50 per cent more space. The project would take five years before it could be rolled out. It will cost between $10bn and $20bn, of which Boeing is prepared to foot a significant proportion. </p> <p>The fundamental difference between satellite and radar is this: radar tracks from the ground, plotting accurately an aircraft's progress on to a screen every three seconds or so. Satellites rely on the plane sending them signals before relaying them to the controller's screen. </p> <p>Satellite, which is already in use through the US government's military GPS system where radar is uneconomic and impractical, are potentially quicker and more accurate than radar - allowing more planes to fly. </p> <p>A next-generation system would initially run on GPS satellites but would eventually need a dedicated fleet of new-generation satellites capable of greater accuracy and predictive power, since plotting an aircraft's future course is as vital as knowing where it is now. </p> <p>GPS can place aircraft to within 7 metres of their position. Fine on remote segments of long-haul journeys, where traffic densities are low, and where the satellite-based Future Air Navigation system has been rolled out. </p> <p>But the key economic battleground will be shorter haul routes in Europe and north-east US. It is only here that the commercial disadvantage of congestion makes the multibillion dollar investment numbers add up behind satellite. Seven metres is not good enough. </p> <p>Of course, it is Boeing, with its strategy of fragmentation, for which a new solution is most important. And the company intends to unveil its system next year in the US, where there are no political borders and less recent investment in terrestrial systems to hold it back. </p> <p>The key problem then will be overcoming the scepticism of an industry more than ever aware of safety, and voters more wary about throwing money in the air now than they were during the Cold War, when the last 'Star Wars' initiative was pursued. </p> <p>David Learmount, operations and safety editor of Flight International, says: 'The key thing is integrity. Radar doesn't lie. The controller knows a plane is where the dot on the screen says it is. But if the plane sends out a wrong signal to the satellite, the dot and the plane may not be the same at all.' </p> <p>Boeing's key problem is to overcome such scepticism. If the system is workable, it will prove that Boeing was right to think small rather than big, as has Airbus. </p> <p>It will also create an immensely powerful aerospace group, managing the airways as well as selling the planes to fill them.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Pantomime time</strong><br> </p> <p>It's the gig everyone in the wacky world of Theatreland is just dying to get. At this time of year thesps up and down the land are anxiously phoning their agents and tearfully asking: 'Any news from Classic FM?' But now the agonising wait is over. The narrator of this year's musical panto - Sleeping Beauty - is to be Side Show Bob, also known as Ross Kemp, or Grant from Eastenders. Classic FM insiders deny Bob's amour, the well-known paedophile hunter and Screws ed Rebekah Wade, will take the role of Beauty. However, we have seen exclusive extracts from the script. In a break with tradition, Bob's somewhat gritty narrative loudly implores Beauty to 'JUST WAKE UP WILL YOU?' Those familiar with the rehearsals say in terms of pathos the scene matches Ross's memorable soliloquies following the death of Tiff. </p> <p><strong> Gossip corner</strong><br> </p> <p>Talking of la Wade, the diary is sad to witness the tawdry goings-on surrounding Sun gossip hackette Marina Hyde. It was the Screws editrix who was responsible for sending Hyde to hack school at City University. But, Hyde, frog-marched out of the Sun after the Mekon found out she had been emailing the heart-throb who is Piers Morgan up to 10 times a day, did not do the whole course. Unfortunately, Hyde was not sent on a chunk of the course which no self-respecting journo should be without: ethics in journalism. Maybe, if Wade had exercised a bit more maternal control and forced Hyde to complete her studies, Fleet Street's gutter press would not have been dragged down by such unseemly shenanigans. </p> <p><strong> Chinese puzzle</strong><br> </p> <p>The surprise news earlier this month that Gao Xingjuan, the veteran exiled Chinese dissident novelist and playwright, had been awarded the Nobel prize for literature had many of the scribbling world's finest scratching their heads in bewilderment. Gao's work has, up until now, been recognised only by those in the know and even they were somewhat perplexed. But not for much longer. The \u00a3615,000 prize will focus attention on what has been a remarkable life. Gao, currently classed as an 'unperson' by the Chinese authorities, had to flee Beijing in 1983 for fear of imprisonment. His novel, Soul Mountain, chronicles the months after his departure. Gao's publisher must be delighted at the news. Except that HarperCollins, (prop R Murdoch) is not renowned for its commitment to publishing books that attack the Chinese authorities. </p> <p><strong> Five comes alive</strong><br> </p> <p>So bye bye David Elstein, cerebral head of Channel 5.

Don't feel sorry for Elstein, who departs with zillions in bonuses. No, instead feel sorry for the Daily Mail, which has waged a protracted and vicious attack on Airey, whom it sees as the antithesis of family values.

  "<p>Boeing, the world's leading aircraft manufacturer, has criticised the Government's determination to sell off part of the UK air traffic control system. The US firm says the plan offers no solution to the problem of an ever-increasing number of planes in European airspace. </p> <p>Seattle-based Boeing had been pondering the merits of joining the bidding for the 46 per cent of the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) being made available to a 'strategic' private sector partner . It decided against a bid because it did not consider the scheme addressed the congestion problem. </p> <p>Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's chief executive, said the privatisation plan was 'not about a solution [to congestion]. As I understand it there it no fundamental change.' </p> <p>'We think there is a total European solution, as opposed to a UK solution.' </p> <p>Stonecipher's comments come at a critical time for the \u00a3500 million NATS sell-off, as a cross-party coalition of peers last week voted by 112 to 90 to delay the project from next March until after the next general election. </p> <p>The vote puts pressure on the Government's Transport Bill, which includes measures to tackle the rail industry. There is speculation it may drop the sale to save the rest of the bill, although the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has maintained that it will press ahead. </p> <p>The congestion problems are acute for both airlines and plane manufacturers. The more crowded the skies, the less attractive flying becomes, particularly in valuable short-haul markets such as Europe. </p> <p>Stonecipher said Boeing plans to unveil a satellite-based system capable of a total overhaul of air traffic management across continents. However, Europe was too fragmented a market in which to launch the system, he added. Political and technical barriers prevented it from being an immediate prospect. </p> <p>Boeing's plan is to launch it first in the US next year.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Stars and Their Lives</strong> ITV <br><strong> The Sins </strong> BBC1 <br><strong> Marion and Geoff </strong> BBC2<strong> <br>EastEnders </strong> BBC1 </p> <p> I'd somehow missed out on the Heather Mills phenomenon, having only the vaguest sense of her as a tabloid-dweller poised at the outer limits of Dianaville with easy access to the Beckham ring road. Last Sunday on <strong> Stars and Their Lives</strong>, in a breathy whirlwind of alliteration, Carol Vorderman helped fill in the gaps - 'She's gorgeous but she's gutsy too! She's the Geordie with the giant heart! The beauty who battles against the bad times! The model who became a model campaigner' - when she introduced the celebrity amputee and consort to Sir Paul McCartney on ITV's answer to This Is Your Life . </p> <p>I couldn't work out how this inscrutably blank-faced Barbie-blonde (see, it's catching) ticked, even while friends from Chris Eubank to Richard Branson to the Duchess of Kent testified to her all-round gutsy goodness, her toughness and non-conformity. Heather accessorised herself with a dry Geordie wit, thereby unsettling the audience who didn't know quite how to respond to stuff like 'I thought: what's my leg doing over there? I've just bought those trainers! I'll never get the blood off!' </p> <p>But then McCartney came on to kiss her and tell us he loved her, which was like watching the post-coital analysis in an edition of Celebrity Blind Date . Macca had improbably starry eyes, youthfully-tinted hair and described his girlfriend as 'a very beautiful true fine momma'. He looked about as besotted as a man can be without having to display a Do Not Disturb sign. 'I always had this dream of a knight in shining armour,' said Heather. </p> <p>Carol told the couple that there is a lot of goodwill towards them, 'isn't there?!'. 'Mmm!' muttered the audience. But, and I can't put my finger on quite why this should be, given Macca's recent pain and Heather's tireless charity work, Carol was wrong; there isn't quite as much goodwill towards them as they'd like. 'People that are jealous of us, or bitter, you look at those people's lives and they give and do nothing for anyone else. But people who like us are giving, nice people,' explained Mills, which presumably leaves most of us in Nowhere-Man's-land, slightly bemused by the combination of Heather's strident sanctimony and Sir Paul's slavering. </p> <p>Funnily enough, Pride was the first of the sins to be tackled in... well, <strong> The Sins, </strong> BBC1's new go-on!-guess-how-many-parts series, in which Pete Postlethwaite plays Len, an ex-getaway driver determined to go straight. I couldn't take my eyes off that spin-dried Sinatra face, in which sweetness and menace seem to fight for control of his features. So much so, that scenes without Postlethwaite faltered slightly, not through any fault of the script or the acting, but just because Pete fills the screen with so much mutable gravitas. </p> <p>Frank Finlay came close, though, as Len's Uncle Irwin, a funeral director contemplating retirement, regretful that 'there is no obvious replacement chomping at the funereal bit' and operating just a few doors up the road from the Hammer House of Horror: 'I have some lungs to drain, but I can work quite happily while you rummage around.' After his turn as Dylan (love-of-my-life) Moran's evil father-in-law in How Do You Want Me?, Finlay is rather belatedly cornering the market in menacing campery - which is odd given that he was doing it brilliantly as far back as Bouquet of Barbed Wire . </p> <p>Len's sin manifested at a party thrown to celebrate his release from a four-year stretch, where he told his crime cronies they were 'dullards' and proclaimed his freshly minted middle-classness: 'I live in Paradise Drive, I've had a letter published in the Telegraph, one of my daughters is up at Oxford', which, predictably, went down like a pair of concrete wellies, particularly with his family. Suddenly, Len's wife (Geraldine James) couldn't get her regular table at Mario's ('Am I or am I not Len Green's wife?' 'Len Green is not Len Green any more,' shrugged Mario) and 'in the light of recent developments' her credit was revoked at the local boutique. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Len was off to the Job Centre, demanding 'proper, stimulating, middle-aged, middle-England legal employment'. The Sins is deliciously wordy, funny and even had a great car chase - very rare on TV, where even Grand Prix look as though everyone's pootling around the M25 in third gear. Next week sees Len working, inevitably, as an undertaker while struggling with Covetousness, particularly in relation to top-of-the-range, fully-loaded hearses. Can't wait. </p> <p>BBC2's <strong> Marion and Geoff </strong> is a 10-part series of 10-minute dramatic monologues by Keith, minicab driver, divorcee and owner of a selection of Alan Partridge's cast-off sweaters (Steve Coogan is one of the show's producers). Last week saw the halfway mark, which is as good a place as any to ponder Keith's swiftly unravelling grip on what little is left of his sanity. The Marion and Geoff of the title are, respectively, Keith's ex-wife and her new husband, who live in Cardiff with Keith's two young sons, while Keith lives in London but regularly drives through the night accompanied by binoculars, a rifle (with telescopic sight) and toys for the children: 'I thought the Action Man might be too violent but, like his mother says, he's a very violent child.' </p> <p>What initially looked like tragic stoicism in the face of complete rejection (re Geoff: 'I don't feel like I've lost a wife, I've gained a friend!') is proving to be a dangerously thin veneer. Last week, Keith told us how he'd gone to see Father Paul, a pastor - he said: 'You don't need the Church, Keith, you need a bloody good solicitor' - and though we are another five fraught weeks away, the d\u00e9nouement looks likely to inspire a nationwide mini-cab boycott. </p> <p> Luckily, young Sonia Jackson got a lift to hospital in a black cab when she gave birth, unexpectedly, to Martin Fowler's daughter in Thursday's <strong> EastEnders</strong>. This was a disappointing episode not least because too many storylines jostled for our attention. Wasn't a teenage girl going into labour without knowing she was pregnant considered enough to sustain 30 minutes of sudsy excitement? Given that Natalie Cassidy is such a good little actress and Sonia such a sympathetic character, they could both have been allowed to hog the show. Instead, the drama was squandered by having Mo Harris play midwife, and constant cutting to the rows between Melanie and Steve, trysts between Frank and Pat, a showdown between Pauline and Martin and, to top it all, an unnecessarily drunk, and therefore pantomimic, Dot Cotton. </p> <p>These days, EastEnders is often distracted from what, in soap terms at least, used to be a laudable concentration span in which plotlines could develop and thrive. At the moment, the cast is too big and too starry and so, perhaps, too demanding of the spotlight. Poor Sonia - she could hardly hear her baby crying over all that din.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Akram Khan</strong> Lilian Baylis Theatre, London EC1<br><strong> Swan Lake</strong> ROH, London WC2 </p> <p> Akram Khan dances in freefall, composed and intense, hanging in there for dear life. Where ballet dancers try to escape gravity, he ignores it. Thanks to his training in the Kathak tradition of Indian dance, he can scoot around space like a jump-cut edit. He's moved before you can blink. </p> <p>Khan has launched his own company (now touring) with a trio, Rush, following his concentrated solo, Fix. The solo is addictive, changing subtly each time he has performed it over the past year. Last week's account was the most ascetic yet, more a Sufi meditation than a journey of discovery. </p> <p>The question of whether Khan can transfer his skills to other bodies is part-answered by Rush. He takes motifs from Fix - spins, falls and rolls - and formalises them into rhythmic patterns. At first, you watch only him; then the structure takes over. Gwyn Emberton and Moya Michael contribute their own qualities; where Khan floats, they flail themselves into weightlessness. Rush feels like a work in progress, ready for further elaboration. </p> <p>Anthony Dowell's last season as artistic director of the Royal Ballet opened with his 1987 production of <strong> Swan Lake</strong>. No doubt the first thing his successor, Ross Stretton, will do is replace it with his own. Maybe then we'll be sorry to lose Dowell's version. </p> <p>But since the last Swan Lake we saw on the Opera House stage in summer was the Kirov's, it is obvious how much the Royal Ballet has been missing over the years. Compared with the Kirov's classic account of the white acts, Dowell's looks decadent, sentimental. His swan-maidens are fluffy, lakeside creatures, their abstract patterns blurred by fluttery dresses and a flock of swan-children, cute, minute and in the way. </p> <p>This soft-edged corps bears no relation to the strikingly athletic Odette of Darcey Bussell, a bird-woman whose pinions have to be held down by her determined suitor (Roberto Bolle). She dances with admirable power, then mars her clean sweep by adding flapping hands and a pained expression. Instead of moving in a sustained flow, as Kirov swan queens do, Bussell goes from one pose to another. She end-stops the dance phrases by holding balances as long as she can. </p> <p>It is an approach that works triumphantly in Act III, where her Odile is boldly alluring. Bolle's Siegfried succumbs without a qualm. A discreet partner and excellent dancer, Bolle needs to assert himself more forcefully to complement Bussell's Olympian magnetism. </p> <p>Johan Persson, making his debut on Wednesday with Tamara Rojo, portrayed a feckless Euro-princeling, obstinately falling for the wrong girl. </p> <p>Rojo's Odile was wicked in the modern sense, whipping off triple fouett\u00e9s and shooting seductive glances from under her dark brows. As Odile, she was all of a piece; as Odette in Act II, she seemed to be giving two interpretations - her own and the Royal Ballet's. </p> <p>Everything came together in the last act, where she and the swans, companions in distress, finally inhabited the same world. Act IV is the climax of this production, instead of the coda, a sign of how skewed towards soppiness Dowell's vision has become.</p>",
  "<p><strong> In the Mood For Love</strong> (98mins, PG) Directed by Wong Kar-Wai; starring Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung </p> <p>Are you In the Mood For Love? It sounds like a romantic comedy - Ryan and Hanks, even Fred and Ginger - but there is nothing remotely comic here. This love is intricate, consuming and elegiac. And, though the mood is essentially European - say mid-career Truffaut, with a whisper of Brief Encounter - the setting is far away in the Hong Kong of the early Sixties. Wong Kar-Wai, chameleon amongst great directors, has done it again. </p> <p>Tony Leung Chiu-Wai is Mr Chow, a thirtysomething journalist with a pretty wife. Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk is Mrs Chow, a super secretary married to a travelling businessman. The couples find rooms to live in adjoining flats. Slowly, it dawns on Leung and Cheung that their increasingly absent partners are having an affair. Slowly, Leung begins his pursuit of the wronged wife and she begins to descend into an agony of doubt. If she succumbs, will she be any better than her faithless husband? </p> <p>Wong Kar-Wai does everything: action movies, cop movies, epics, often with a French new-wave feel of improvisation. Here, there is none of that. Instead, we move meticulously from one little box to the next, from one poky room to the room next door. Other rooms in the apartment block are filmed down corridors or over shoulders; the only excursions beyond are into deserted streets where rain falls torrentially around the sheltering pair. Complete claustrophobia. We never see the faces of the adulterous husband or his mistress, only their backs: they are ciphers throwing Leung and Cheung into starker relief. </p> <p>Does that sound a trifle dour? It isn't. The family who rent Cheung her room are warm and effusive, always offering food and companionship. Leung's hoary journalist mate is rounded and jolly. There is human life just across the landing or at the office; the characters are rooted in place and time - but that time, too, matters. Falling in love in the Hong Kong of four decades ago isn't a quick, modern fling. You feel the brooding disapproval of a more traditional Chinese society. Contacts must be secret, emotions hidden. Celia Johnson looks out of the railway carriage window. Upper lips stiffen and then quiver. When Cheung is trapped - innocently enough - in Leung's bedroom overnight, because others are playing mah-jong outside, there's no question of a quick roll on the bed. Cheung lies there alone, imprisoned by inhibition. </p> <p>Wong Kar-Wai is never entirely unobtrusive. The director's presence remains constant - sometimes playing jokes, like rehearsals of the farewell speeches Cheung will make to her husband, which appear, for a moment, to be the real thing. But that constant presence merely focuses us more hypnotically on the central relationship; and upon a particular sequence of months and passions locked away, resistance eroding as the mood takes hold. </p> <p>It doesn't work completely. Leung and Cheung are two of China's most f\u00eated stars, one stubby, battered and thoughtfully bemused, the other sinuous and tortured. They hold the screen and the still, silent Leung is especially hypnotic as he calculates and manipulates. But Cheung has an almost impossibly testing role. Can she make us, as twenty-first-century spectators, comprehend and share her inner turmoil? Can she become somebody we not only understand intellectually, but weep for in her desperate dilemma of the soul? </p> <p>Maybe Truffaut could have got that from Nathalie Baye, because her face is infinitely expressive and part of a world we understand. Cheung cannot quite convey that. She agonises, but she can't draw us in. The gap between eras and cultures is too great. The background score, by Mike Galasso, plonks away, sometimes Nat King Cole, sometimes second-hand Michel Legrand, so that you know you ought to understand. But no - you can see the suffering, yet you don't feel it. A love story without the hint of tear. </p> <p>But for all that this is an accomplished and memorable film, one that Wong Kar-Wai fought to finish through two years of censorship and Eastern financial crisis. Why should the censors have worried? There is no sex here, no sweaty coupling. This is love pursued, love won, love lost; love as a mingling of minds and calculation; love as regret. The chameleon called love.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2</strong> (90mins, 18) Directed by Joe Berlinger; starring Kim Director, Jeffrey Donovan <br><strong> It Was an Accident </strong> (100mins, 18) Directed by Metin H\u00fcseyin; starring Max Beesley, Thandie Newton <br><strong> I Could Read the Sky</strong> (86 mins, 15) Directed by Nichola Bruce; starring Dermot Healy </p> <p> Sometimes, one and one don't make two. <strong> Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2</strong>, has next to nothing of the Project that set cash registers ringing. Not the same cast, the same director, the same style or any continuation - if that were possible - of the same story. This is tosh of an altogether lower order. There isn't even, since you ask, a book of shadows. </p> <p>Forget the artful triumph of what we must now call Blair Witch 1, the hand-held cameras which followed three students into the woods of Black Hills, Maryland, and, half-way between documentary and drama, appeared to chronicle their vanishing, victims of a phantom we never saw. If that was docuhorror, this is schlocku-horror. </p> <p>It doesn't start like that. Joe Berlinger, who specialises in filming real murder mysteries, has had the bright notion of taking the actual fame that the Project brought to the village of Burkittsville and sending five more potential victims into the woods on a kind of idiotic guided tour. Cue in two minutes or so of genuinely funny cod interviews with local residents. Hope rises.There weren't many jokes in BW1. Hope falls. The quintet are standard freaks for the teenage market. They reach the house at the heart of darkness, they come out intact: but then, in the old warehouse which Jeffrey Donovan, their loopy tour guide uses as his Blair Witch mail shop, the curse of the Black Hills catches up with them. Standard freaks, standard mayhem. </p> <p>Where the chill of the original came from not knowing, not seeing, Berlinger jolts the screen with blood and guts. Where the sparse, $30,000 production values of BW1 were integral to its queasy credibility, here cash and computer effects rule this dotty roost. </p> <p>Our unfortunate five give us nothing to identify with. Donovan's Jeff is fresh out of an asylum, but nothing's ultimately made of his supreme flakiness. Kim Director wears white pancake make-up straight out of The Munsters and has the occasional gift of prophesy, except where her own fate's concerned; Erica Leerhsen is a student witch much given to hopping round in the nude; Tristan Skyler and Stephen Barker are dopey young lovers. None of them is going to win an Oscar. When Donovan protests out loud that 'I don't understand this' the audience gurgles with instant derision. </p> <p>Still, it will doubtless make a few million - and deserve to, not entirely for its effrontery. Berlinger knows how to keep the action zipping along. Arch references to movies past and present are scattered liberally. If BW1 hadn't existed, BW2 might have passed muster in the Saturday night stalls. Go expecting to be kept awake, but not to be amazed or chilled. </p> <p>So to two films from closer to home, both derived from successful novels, both blessed with an Arts Council grant. Why are the financial arbiters of culture favouring <strong> It Was an Accident</strong>? Does somebody up there in Great Peter Street think that British film is perishing for lack of London gangster movies? They might as well erect a statue of Ray Winstone in Trafalgar Square. </p> <p>To be fair, this Accident, contrived by Ol Parker from Jeremy Cameron's book, has some promising things going for it. Belly laughs for a start; a Runyonesque version of Walthamstow street life for another. Nicky Burkett, played by Chjwetel Ejiofor, is back on those streets after four years in the slammer. </p> <p>He wants to go straight and shack up with a policeman's daughter (Thandie Newton), but villains keep getting in his way. There's Mickey Cousins (Max Beesley), your original blond idiot; there's Rameez (Sidh Solanki), your Asian Mr Big; there's Fitch (James Bolam), who 'used to drive for the Krays'. </p> <p>The first half bowls along nicely, full of neat touches. The cops, save for Newton's thoughtful black dad (Hugh Quarshie), are Keystone galumphers. Ejiofor, of course, has a wonderfully lippy kid by a discarded partner. The dodgy flats, motors and market tradesmen combine to make this Walthamstow a fun place to be. Metin H\u00fcseyin (from Common as Muck ) knows how to stage comic setpieces. Where does it all go wrong? Pacing, tone, language. </p> <p>You can't keep going as fast as this without a break. What works for a TV sitcom doesn't work for a film three times as long. The haste becomes frenetic, and thus disjunct. And this is a Brit gangster effort (without Sadie Frost for once) so, naturally, it can't be all laughs, can it? You have to have a bit of - you know - thumping and shooting and smashing. Bring on the gratuitous violence. Exit the light touch. </p> <p>Language? I should effing say so, every effing 15 seconds. It ain't a matter of prudery, mate, it just gets effing boring in the effing end. </p> <p>The great unresolved question is how Thandie Newton, luminously svelte in Mission Impossible 2 , here turns up as Ehofor's relatively chaste bit of fluff in an anorak, but her very presence makes the wider point. Newton is a considerable actress who can play a human being (among many other things). Ol Parker's script gives here little to do but frown and look disapproving. That's not an accident - it's an effing waste of effing talent. </p> <p>Those who like their art with a capital C, as in Council, will find <strong> I Could Read the Sky </strong> more their evocative fix. It's an adaptation, by Nichola Bruce, of the 'photo-novel' by Timothy O'Grady and Steve Pyke which was Gerry Adams's best book of 1997. Dermot Healy, the distinguished Irish novelist, has the central acting role. He is old, creaky Irish labourer, and he lives in a London garret, shuffling the bare boards, remembering. </p> <p>He remembers the white-washed cottage in the green fields of home. He remembers his mum and dad and the poverty that forced him to come, with thousands of others, to the building sites of England. He remembers the wife who died and the mate who died sleeping in a giant sewage pipe and his mother who died, black with cancer when they did the post-mortem, and the father whose grave he was left to disinter in the mud and rain. All this with the photos of the book opened out into landscapes and small scenes from the past, performed by Ireland's finest, like Stephen Rea. </p> <p>It is a tour de force from Healy, a ginger, shambling wreck who speaks the almost-poetry with arresting precision. Beautiful words; beautiful music, from Iarla O'Lionaird; beautiful moving pictures from Nichola Bruce. Too beautiful, too relentlessly melancholic? That's the trouble. </p> <p>The photo-novel works so brilliantly because you can linger over O'Grady's prose and set it against Pyke's photographs, choosing your own pace and time, letting the images grows. Contract that into 86 minutes of movie narrative, though, and the obligatory returns to Healy's garret become a bit of chore, without light and shade. You either want to know more or less - and the death of his inevitably beautiful wife (Maria Doyle Kennedy) feels merely gratuitous, one more awful thing piled on top. </p> <p>For all the novelty of its form, we've been here before amid the Irish mists of exile. Somehow, I wanted to be told something new.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Tantalus</strong> Denver Center for the Performing Arts, Colorado </p> <p> Why Denver? After 15 years of labour, John Barton, director and co-founder of the Royal Shakespeare Company, produces a massive cycle of plays. It's based on Greek mythology, which means that it touches on almost every issue flying around the twenty-first century: vengeance after war, the chances of a just peace, the impossibility of assigning blame and the point at which a beauty becomes an icon. Stephen Daldry declares he would rip out the seating in the Old Vic in order to stage it. </p> <p>Peter Hall, Barton's life-long friend who becomes, together with his son, Edward, director of the cycle proclaims that if he were running the RSC he'd 'scrap some of the repertory' in order to put it on. But when the premiere of <strong> Tantalus </strong> takes place it is hundreds of miles away, at the Denver Center for Performing Arts in Colorado. </p> <p>Lack of cash meant that the RSC, who commissioned the piece, couldn't put it on. There was no room at the Dome. And no television company was prepared to stump up. This is a shaming indictment of British arts policy: avid for buildings; less concerned with what takes place inside them. But the move across the Atlantic turned out to be peculiarly apt. As if the Fates had been at work. </p> <p>A play which shows the sacking of one civilisation and the making of another - Greece - was performed in a town whose glossy towers and silent gleaming malls are surrounded by the relics of faded glories, by old mining towns with names, such as Silver Plume, as evocative as Troy, though now their only gold hangs from aspen branches. It was acted by a cast of Americans and Britons in a place formed by Hispanic and Native American and pioneer cultures. </p> <p>And Denver's craggy setting proved particularly piquant. Tantalus was punished by continual threat and constantly frustrated desire for betraying the gods. In Hades, grapes were dangled in front of his mouth and a rock was suspended precariously above him: in the Halls' production, you see sand drifting down and at crucial moments hear warning groans, as if an avalanche were about to launch itself on to the stage. Where better to acknowledge this stony menace than in a city shadowed by the Rockies? </p> <p>It's a tribute to Tantalus that it wakes you up to such parallels. </p> <p>And the tribute's the greater because Barton's enterprise has one foot in the academy. He has created his own version of the conduct and consequences of the Trojan War. He has drawn on ancient sources, though without using lines from classical drama. He has written in unrhymed verse, though the verse format isn't always detectable, or delectable. He has larded the dialogue with literary allusions ranging from Troilus and Cressida to The Importance of Being Earnest: 'One rape is a misfortune; two cause comment.' </p> <p> Tantalus has been cut and edited by the directors. But its nine remaining plays - in which the playwright Colin Teevan is credited with providing some 'additional text' - still amount to a marathon: at Denver, they started at 10am and ended at 10.45pm. It is, remarked one member of the audience, 'such a dare to do something this long about something so old'. </p> <p>A battery of surprises keeps the audience on its intellectual toes, not to say tantalised. The structure of the plays is unexpected: a series of cliffhangers, which Barton has described as soap-operatic. The dialogue switchbacks unpredictably from bleak to droll. The plot twists are startling: the Greeks sail off for Troy, but land up in Mysia; Helen is said not to have gone to Troy at all because that was another, more superficial Helen. And, alongside a reprisal of classical tragic themes - do human beings have any control over their own destinies? Are patterns of revenge imprinted through generations? - Barton charts his own concerns. Not least of these is the history of drama, a movement from storytelling to acting, which suggests that Ulysses started out as a bit of a fraud, and that Achilles's son was the first actor - getting himself up in drag in order to beguile the Trojans. </p> <p>Some of this is exhilarating. There are terrific performances from the fluidly transforming (American) Analee Jefferies and from (British) Greg Hicks, as a wry Agamemnon and a tottering carnival Priam. Some of it is casually misogynistic: does Helen, in a world of adulterous men, have to be pure to be adored? </p> <p>Some scenes are made more vital by the Halls' robust, sometimes gorgeous production: the Trojan women, about to be branded by their conquerors, appear in their red wedding dresses like the stumps of teeth; Mick Sands' dulcimers and drums ripple through the action; Dionysis Fotopoulos's design, a hemisphere of sand with a screen of smokey glass at its back, is transformed by Sumio Yoshii's lighting into a rippling underwater region. </p> <p>Other episodes are made more ludicrous: it's bad enough that Barton's female chorus is required to behave like stooges teasing out information from a charismatic male poet. ('Yes he was a god-swan.' 'Which god was it?') But the clumpiness is increased by setting the scene on a Fifties-going-on-Sixties beach, with a gaggle of girls, clenched by bikinis and clutching transistors, desperately trying to look hip. Never can there have been so much explanation with so little clarity. It's a fluent, exciting production which is insufficiently peculiar. </p> <p>It has spawned its own epic struggles. The artistic director of the Gate, Mick Gordon, was engaged to work with the Halls, but exited early. One actor was sacked; one left. Barton has described the performed version of his cycle as drastically condensed', and explains 'my own vision, however passionate may not necessarily be welcome'. He was not at the premiere. </p> <p> Tantalus comes to the Lowry Centre in Salford in January, and then tours Britain.</p>",
  "Until last January, my 85-year-old widowed mother lived in her own suburban home. She was hospitalised with flu and assessed as needing full-time nursing care, as her family had known for some time. Since then, she has lived in a nearby, cheerful, friendly nursing home but as her strength has improved she has become more and more depressed at her situation to the point of needing medication. <p>Although her short-term memory loss and Parkinson's means that she can't sustain her thoughts, they clearly centre on: 'Why am I here?' </p> <p>I know she feels that she has a right to be cared for by my brother or myself, just as she cared for her own mother-in-law for 10 years. </p> <p>My brother and his wife live nearby but work full-time. My husband and I, while early retired, live six- and-a-half-hours' drive away in a remote location. When any of us visit her she clings to us and asks us to stay with her. I do not feel I could possibly offer her what she needs but I also feel I have abandoned her. </p> <p>Please would you comment on all this? </p> <p> <b>W.A. of Pembrokeshire</b> </p> <p> A person who gives up her own concerns to look after another individual shows an awesome degree of philanthropy, which I for one could not match. Giving total care can be tough and heart-breaking, and virtue very seldom brings its own reward. </p> <p>Everyone gets more selfish with passing years, progressive incapacity and narrowing horizons, and less able to see matters from another perspective. This defect is multiplied when there is encroaching senility. If you were to restructure your life to take on your mother's care, you could well find the task you had set yourself intolerably burdensome. </p> <p>You might discover, as others have done, that your own marital relationship suffer to the point of collapse, and that even your own patience and good intentions break down in the face of unrelieved, infuriating, round-the-clock demands. </p> <p>Instead, your mother is in a professionally-run home where the weight of caring is spread among several attendants who can hand over at the appropriate time, walk away, enjoy their own concerns, take a break, recharge their own batteries. Ask yourself: would your mother in, when fully compos mentis, have wanted you to give up all your retired comfort to dance attendance on her? I should abhor the idea of becoming that sort of drag on my children. </p> <p>Sometimes, senility reproduces reflexes which are peculiar to early infancy, such as the clutching and clinging that you describe. They invoke similar responses in you as in young mothers, a stressful perception of the needs of this helpless being, and an urgent desire to meet them. The manipulation is not intentional but it is compelling. </p> <p>Don't let the discomfort of your conscience drive you to take on an unreasonable task, but don't let it drive you away either. There is much you can do, visiting and adding to her comfort, being loving and cheerful, but firm. </p> <p>With a rising proportion of elderly folk in the population and a government that distances itself from the responsibility of providing care for them, your problem is going to become increasingly common. If it is expected that old people are to be looked after by the next generation, there must be a cut-off point; people in their seventies should not be full-time carers for people in their nineties. </p> <p>I've an idea that we should reactivate the concept of national service for young people after leaving school; two years of caring for old people in various circumstances. </p> <p>The old and the young meld very well together, and exposure to the needs of others is excellent training, and the scheme would provide huge potential employment at many levels for organisers and supervisors. Some such innovation will be needed if present trends in longevity continue. </p> <p> <b> Next week's dilemma is from A.M. of Lincoln</b> </p> <p> I am in the process of divorcing my husband of five years. We have a two-year-old daughter. When we first separated, he came to see her regularly but his visits have now become less frequent because, he says, he cannot bear seeing me. </p> <p>So far, I have done nothing to encourage him because, although my rational self is keen for him to stay in contact with us so that he and our daughter can build a relationship, there's a part of me that would not be sorry to see him fade away. </p> <p>He has an alcohol problem which has worsened over the years, and I worry what kind of a role model he will be and whether our daughter will be able to cope with his problems. </p> <p>Should I encourage him to see her regularly or let him quietly drift away?</p>",
  "<p>Paul Merton loves the way people come up to him and say, 'You look different - oh you've had your hair cut!' as if having his hair cut could explain his great weight loss. As you can see on the new series of Have I Got News For You, he really does look different, no longer puffy and dishevelled but positively svelte, a shimmering vision of elegance almost like - well, not quite like - Angus Deayton. Two years ago he ballooned to a terrifying 17 stone and was frightened by his own passport photograph. So since then he's been eating sensibly and laying off the beer. In the past few months, he's also stopped eating wheat or anything containing gluten because he found it made him lethargic, and the result is that he has lost three stone. </p> <p>Anyway, he looks good - but disconcertingly different to the Paul Merton one knows and loves from television. I was quite worried about meeting him because I always got the impression from Have I Got News (not so much from Room 101) that he could be a bit chippy, sullen, taciturn - I feared it might be a case of me asking ever longer, daffier questions and him giving ever shorter, surlier replies. Whereas in fact he was almost puppyishly friendly, sunny, hello birds, hello trees, and eager to share his enthusiasms, especially his enthusiasm for comedy.</p> <p>He once said, 'I could have been the world's biggest comedy anorak, the most boring man imaginable' and although I wouldn't say boring, there are certain questions such as 'Why do you admire Buster Keaton?' which bring out the inner trainspotter to an alarming degree. As a boy, he used to watch silent comedies on his own projector and analyse every scene, but he's still doing it now - he told me that recently he's bought all the films of Charlie Chaplin on DVD and has been watching them in sequence from the first in 1915 to the last in 1967, tracing the development of his technique.</p> <p>The essential, all-encompassing difference between Paul Merton on telly and Paul Merton in real life is that the real-life version is obviously a happy man. After a rocky couple of years when his marriage to Caroline Quentin broke up, he is now happily settled with his new partner, Sarah Parkinson, and declares: 'We are together for the rest of our lives.' And anyway he is happy because, 'Look, I'm sitting here having lunch in a nice restaurant [the Caprice] on a Monday when I could have been in the civil service office in Tooting - I mean, life is good. And on a day like today when I can see people getting on the tube and I can see their drawn faces and I think, They're going to get into their offices - \"Morning, Lorraine\", \"Morning, Mr Hennessy\" - and that's what they're doing till Friday, I think: Well, just by not having to do that, I'm already ahead of the game.' </p> <p>Last month he and Sarah went on holiday to the Maldives and 'We went to this desert island - they take you there in a boat, and give you a picnic basket and a walkie-talkie - and had a little ceremony between the two of us, with nobody else there. So it was very romantic and we did it at midday on October fifth, so that's 5/10/2000 to make it memorable.' But why not marry properly? 'Oh because Sarah's not keen on the whole church/state thing, and I'm kind of like-minded, really. Why not just two people on a desert island? We got married in nature rather than in church.' </p> <p>Sarah is 38 and the daughter of an actor called Robin Parkinson. She used to be an actress but told Paul particularly to tell me that she no longer wishes to be described as that - she is now a writer-producer. She co-wrote and associate-produced his new film The Suicidal Dog (of which more later), and is also producing a radio series called Catholics in Comedy in which Paul will interview other comedians who were raised as Catholics. (There are surprisingly many of them - Kathy Burke, Julian Clary, Lily Savage, Steve Coogan, Caroline Aherne - quite apart from what he calls 'the Irish contingent'.) Obviously they plan to work together as much as possible. </p> <p>They met in 1995 when Paul Merton and Caroline Quentin were doing a three-month run of The Live Bed Show in London, and Sarah was Caroline's understudy. (She never got to play the role because Caroline was never ill.) At that stage, he says, they were 'just talking'. But then in 1997 his marriage to Quentin broke up. Quentin told me that she was completely shocked and mystified at the time - 'I didn't know my marriage was going wrong till it ended, really.' They had been married seven years since Paul proposed on bended knee by the statue of Eros in Piccadilly Circus and they seemed in many ways a perfect couple. But after Quentin's career took off with Men Behaving Badly, their various work commitments meant they were often apart. When they announced their separation in April 1997, they were hounded by the tabloids for several weeks and The Mirror even sent a pseudo-buyer to their house to photograph their bedroom. Merton is still pretty bitter about all that. He and Quentin have always been careful not to say anything hurtful about each other in interviews, and they are friendly on the rare occasions when they meet. Last year she had a baby by Sam Farmer, a television researcher. </p> <p>Do Paul and Sarah hope to have children? 'Yes, well, we could, we will. We'll have to wait and see really. But I mean - we're doing what we should be doing on a very regular basis, so it's in the lap of the gods! And yes, I could have a child now, because I'm financially secure for the foreseeable future and I don't have expensive tastes anyway. If it had happened when I was 23, 24 it would have been a disaster because I'd have had to give up doing comedy, or attempting to do comedy. But now - yes, maybe.' And Sarah would like children, too? 'Yes - I thought she should get involved at some stage, and the planning stage seemed a good stage to begin!' </p> <p> Paul and Sarah live in considerable style in a listed Georgian house in Parson's Green, Fulham, where he says nobody recognises him 'because they're all too posh to watch television - the only people who recognise me are van drivers passing through'. It is actually less than a mile from where he was born 43 years ago, but Fulham has come up in the world, as has he. His father was a tube train driver, his mother a nurse, and they lived in a council flat. He was very shy as a boy but hooked on comedy from an early age. He thinks the two are connected - he says most comedians are shy. 'I was never one to go up to someone as a five- or six-year-old and say, \"Hello, my name's Paul, will you be my friend?\" But I found if I did an impression of the PE teacher or whatever and people laughed, then they did like me, and so then they started talking to me, rather than me making the initial overture and then maybe being rebuffed. They come to you already happy, you know?' </p> <p>Even as a small child, he really studied comedy. He would watch Sunday at the London Palladium and ignore the singers and dancers but 'If a comic came on - it didn't matter how appalling he was - I would watch, fascinated by the whole process. I got into Laurel and Hardy very early on, Charlie Chaplin, Marx Brothers, the Goons on the radio. Monty Python started when I was about 12, Tony Hancock I loved, and I read PG Wodehouse - I loved comedy in all its forms. I was an avid consumer of comedy. I think there was something in my head whereby I was trying to learn as much as I could about it without actually doing it. I read every book about Buster Keaton and Chaplin to see how they worked - it's all about dedication, tunnel vision, pursuit of perfection, getting the gag right.' </p> <p>But he planned his career slowly, carefully, deliberately, because he didn't want to be famous for five minutes, he wanted to last . His dream is to be like Bob Monkhouse, still working in his seventies. So after school (two A levels), he went to work for the civil service in the Tooting employment office, and wrote scripts in his spare time and sent them off to the BBC. But he eventually realised that they would not buy scripts from unknowns - he had to make his name first as a performer, which meant doing stand up. And he knew he wouldn't have the energy, or perhaps the will, to do that while doing a nine-to-five job. So he left the civil service on 29 February 1980 - he chose the date deliberately so he would remember it - and signed on.</p> <p>'It was a bizarre existence I led in my early twenties - that clich\u00e9 of the comedian who goes out and entertains a roomful of people and then goes home to a lonely bedsit was unbelievably poignant for me because that was exactly what I was doing. I had periods of real loneliness. But it was something I'd chosen to do, it hadn't been imposed on me, so I could never complain. And I didn't have any dependents or anything to worry about other than just living on the dole and doing good gigs, but then coming back and still being on my own.' Did he have girlfriends? 'A couple here and there, but not really. I was never one to do the chasing - I was always very shy - and even if some girl had come up and said hello, I couldn't have said, \"Come back to the bedsit\" - she would have seen it and said goodbye.' </p> <p>He was often depressed - he remembers spending whole days in bed because he couldn't face getting up. 'I always had to battle that thing with confidence - and it took me two years after I left the civil service to get on stage at the Comedy Store. But again, that was partly because I wanted it so much, because to have a great ambition and then find out you're no good at it is potentially quite soul-destroying. So I was postponing or delaying the moment of truth.' But in April 1982 he did his act at the Comedy Store and got a standing ovation and walked all the way home to Streatham in a daze of happiness.</p> <p>Gradually, he built up his bookings and his fees and by 1987 had saved enough to hire a hall and put on his own show at the Edinburgh Festival. It got terrific reviews - but the day after the first night he broke his leg playing football, went to hospital, developed a pulmonary embolism (which almost killed him) and caught hepatitis A, so he was out of work for months. This led to another of his big decisions - he felt he had served his apprenticeship on the comedy circuit, it was time to make the leap into television. He wrote scripts for Julian Clary, appeared on Whose Line Is It Anyway? and in 1989 was commissioned to write his own Paul Merton show for Channel 4.</p> <p>But now again, as when he broke his leg, he wobbled on the brink of success - only this was much more than a wobble. It was a mental illness that put him in the Maudsley psychiatric hospital for six weeks, though even now he yelps when I refer to it as a nervous breakdown and says it was not a nervous breakdown - it was a 'manic episode' caused by a combination of overwork and anti-malaria pills. 'I just think it was a sort of manic excitement, really, because everything was happening and it was going really well. I felt that it was a good thing. Because, apart from just before I went into the Maudsley, I felt good, I felt alive, I felt alert, I was full of energy. It was the people around me who were getting worried - I wasn't too bothered. I thought: I'm achieving everything.'</p> <p>But his friends were worried because he was talking non-stop, almost gibbering, and working 24 hours a day. He suffered what he thought was a heart attack during a run-through of Whose Line Is It Anyway? and they called a doctor, who told him he was hyperventilating and must take some rest. But of course he couldn't rest because he was far too busy. He developed paranoia, thinking that people were talking about him behind his back and that he was being followed everywhere by Freemasons. One day he went to the corner shop and thought everyone was looking at him oddly, and the shopkeeper was reading things about him off his credit card. 'I remember coming out of the shop and running down the side road back to the flat and I had a filmic image of all the curtains twitching.' </p> <p>His girlfriend persuaded him to go to the Maudsley but he discharged himself after a few days because he was desperate to finish writing his Channel 4 series. But then he broke down again and was admitted for six weeks and put on Largactyl. He recalls the embarrassment of going to group therapy sessions with serious schizophrenics and people who had attacked strangers with knives when his only problem, he thought, was that his Channel 4 series had been postponed. He also remembers when one of the fellow patients committed suicide and he volunteered to speak at his funeral but someone shouted something. 'And suddenly I was in stand-up mode. I had to fight the urge to use a putdown, to say, \"Oh I remember when I had my first pint of lager...\" It was a very black comic moment.' </p> <p> But he also remembers the precise moment when he started to get better. It was a Saturday evening, a friend came to visit him and 'What I wanted was for somebody to hug me. But he, being a typical middle-class male, was keeping his distance. And his emotional detachment made me feel even more alone. When he went away, I felt so lonely, I howled, like animals cry.' But that howl of pain was a sort of catharsis, and after that he recovered quickly. Even so, he was reluctant for many years to talk about his stay in the Maudsley. It was only last year, on The South Bank Show, that he fully came clean, and also returned to the Maudsley for the first time, to open a new garden for the patients. He has had no manic episodes since, but has been careful to pace himself and not take on more work than he could handle. </p> <p>Ironically, the Channel 4 series he had literally driven himself mad to write was not a great success. But it hardly mattered because by then Have I Got News For You had started, and made him a star. It is now in its 10th year, and has just shifted to BBC1. One year Merton dropped out and the producers tried various substitutes, whose failure Merton watched with undisguised glee. I said I thought Eddie Izzard was good but Merton corrected me - 'Not bad. His first one was good, second not bad - third one was awful. I'm not being unfair to him, but he was doing the same gags in the third week that he'd done in the second week. But I knew that nobody coming in could immediately pick up and do what I was doing, so I wasn't worried. And I thought me not doing a series would be a good shot in the arm - and it was. I think they missed me a lot, and since then I think we're in the best form we've ever been.' </p> <p>But why is he often so rude to his guests - why does he ignore them so cruelly? He says first, they're not his guests, he has no say in choosing them, he's not even allowed to go into the Have I Got News production office because they say he might see the questions. He only once managed to get his choice of guest on the programme - Spike Milligan - but other times when he's suggested someone he's been overruled. Nor does he have any power of veto - 'I mean, I've sat next to the Hamiltons and I'm no big fan of theirs.' But anyway he says he's not deliberately rude to the guests, or only once, to Teddy Taylor. But he concedes that he might sometimes appear rude. He recently played an old video of Peter Cook on the show and was shocked to see that he never spoke to Cook - 'It looks like I'm being spectacularly rude to him but it's just that, you know, I wanted to kiss him!' </p> <p>He could make a perfectly good living from doing programmes like Have I Got News and Room 101 and Just a Minute (on Radio 4), where he just has to turn up and be funny. Turning up and being funny is no problem for him - he has been doing it since school, he still does it every Sunday at the Comedy Store, where he and Josie Lawrence and friends do a regular improv night, which he says is 'like flying - like jazz, almost'. He is amazed when people say that his Have I Got News jokes must be scripted - 'Nobody's ever given me a joke, I don't need it' - the only preparation he and Hislop get is that they see the headlines and pictures at the run-through half an hour beforehand. </p> <p>But he gets a bit twitchy when people say he is so great on Have I Got News because 'It's just me being a panellist, and I don't think I'm really working at the top of my powers - I just sit there and say something rude about Michael Heseltine and everybody's pleased! It's not quite enough, really. I mean, it's wonderful to be doing a show that's so well paid, and all I have to do is turn up on the Thursday at half five and by 9 o'clock I'm done. And 16 weeks of the year that's all I do and for someone who worked in the civil service, who used to dread going into work on a Monday... So I enjoy Have I Got News and I'm glad people like it, but it's not all I want to do. It's not like making a great film or creating something that has longevity. And that's how I judge comedy, really - will it be funny in 40 years' time?' </p> <p>So now he has made his pitch for longevity - written and directed a short film called The Suicidal Dog which is going out on arthouse release with Chuck and Buck over the next few weeks, and then being shown on BBC2 some time next year. I went to its premiere at the Raindance Festival the other week and it was well received, with plenty of laughs and big applause at the end. The big excitement for film buffs - and for Paul Merton - is that the director of photography is 86-year-old Jack Cardiff, who worked with Powell and Pressburger, with Hitchcock, with Houston (on The African Queen) and photographed Marilyn Monroe in The Prince and the Showgirl.</p> <p>Merton only got him by accident because when Hat Trick, the producers, asked who he wanted as director of photography, he couldn't think of any names apart from Jack Cardiff, whose autobiography he'd read. Luckily Cardiff was a fan of Have I Got News and agreed to do it. But Merton was nervous the first day shooting because 'The crew all knew Jack or knew his reputation and were very very pleased to be working with him, whereas I'm just the bloke off the telly. So for the first few hours they were a bit unsure. And then I contradicted one of Jack's suggestions and there was a sort of hushed moment, everyone waiting to see what would happen, but then he said, \"Yes, that's better, we'll do that.\" He could pull all kinds of rank on you, but he doesn't - he's a great man to work with and I was very lucky to get him.' </p> <p>Also, Merton thinks, he's made a bit of film history, or at least film trivia. Jack Cardiff was a child actor before he was a cameraman and first appeared in a film aged four. He also appears (just the back of his head, on a train) in Merton's film - 'So that's 82 years between first and last film appearances - who else has had that much longevity? Not Lillian Gish, I don't think. Or Bette Davis. I'd have to look it up, but I think he's got to have some sort of record there.' This is exactly the sort of useless information Merton loves - for someone who only got grade five CSE in maths, he is weirdly hooked on numbers and statistics. </p> <p>His big ambition now is to make more films - hopefully a full-length feature eventually. 'It's like a bug that bites you and gets in your bloodstream. There's something magical about film, it's the ultimate for me, because it's kind of permanent - inasmuch as anything is. When I went to see Buster Keaton when I was about 14 and I came out of the cinema having really laughed at this film which had been made 50 years before, I thought: That's immortality. It's fantastic. And if my film is shown after I'm gone and it gets laughs - it doesn't get any better than that, I don't think. Though obviously I'd prefer to live forever!'</p> <p>\u0095 The Suicidal Dog is released on 10 November</p>",
  "<p>You can't put a price on happiness,of course, but, according to the NatWest pensions index, you can give a figure for what it takes to be financially content in retirement.</p> <p> On average, pensioners questioned for the NatWest survey said that they found life easy with a yearly before-tax income of \u00a310,000 - although retired members of the professional classes said they needed an average of \u00a315,000 to feel comfortably off. </p> <p><strong> The good news for future pensioners is that, since starting the survey in 1998, NatWest has found that the proportion of people on track for financial contentment has gone up from a fifth to a quarter of current workers.</strong> </p> <p>And the bad news? </p> <p><strong> Three out of four people are heading for a financially difficult retirement because they are not paying enough into their pensions.</strong> </p> <p>How much is enough? </p> <p><strong> Whatever it takes to achieve your desired retirement income. If you are in an occupational pension scheme, your employers should be able to tell you whether the amount you pay is sufficient or whether you need to top it up by making additional voluntary contributions (AVCs).</strong> </p> <p>I've got a personal pension. </p> <p><strong> In that case, enough means the amount it will take to build up a sufficiently large fund to buy the level of income you think you will need to live on in retirement.</strong> </p> <p>Can you be more specific? </p> <p><strong> When do you want to retire?</strong> </p> <p>When I'm 60 in 20 years' time. </p> <p><strong> And how much income do you think you will you need?</strong> </p> <p>Without taking a drastic cut in income, not much less than my current salary of \u00a330,000. </p> <p><strong> Are you sure about that? How much do you currently spend on your mortgage and pension?</strong> </p> <p>Including mortgage protection insurance, we spend about \u00a3600 a month on the mortgage and I pay \u00a3200 into my pension. I'm not sure what my wife pays. </p> <p><strong> And will you still need income to pay for those things once you're retired?</strong> </p> <p>No. The mortgage will be paid off by then and I was rather hoping that the pension would start paying me. </p> <p><strong> In that case, would you agree that you could do without \u00a39,600 of income a year?</strong> </p> <p>I suppose so - and presumably I wouldn't need the \u00a3200 a month I pay in National Insurance either. </p> <p><strong> True. So a target pension of \u00a318,000 would be quite reasonable?</strong> </p> <p>Yes, but that still doesn't tell me whether I'm paying enough into my pension. </p> <p><strong> What is your personal pension currently worth?</strong> </p> <p>About \u00a330,000. </p> <p><strong> You're not paying enough.</strong> </p> <p>What makes you so sure? </p> <p><strong> If you retired at age 60 today, you would need a fund of about \u00a3215,000 to buy an annuity which would pay you a pension of \u00a318,000. </strong> </p> <p><strong>In 20 years' time - assuming that you want your target pension to keep pace with inflation at 3 per cent a year - you'll need a fund of about \u00a3390,000 to produce the same level of retirement spending power. </strong> </p> <p><strong>That's assuming that annuity rates remain the same, which is unlikely given that they have been falling in recent years.</strong> </p> <p>Have you taken growth in my current fund and monthly contributions of \u00a3200 into account? </p> <p><strong> Yes, and basic-rate tax relief too. And even taking a supremely optimistic view - which is to assume that your fund will grow by 9 per cent a year - your fund would still be worth about \u00a350,000 less than it needs to be. If the fund grew at 5 per cent a year, you would have less than half the amount you will need to buy a pension of \u00a332,500.</strong> </p> <p>Where did that figure come from? </p> <p><strong> It's \u00a318,000 inflated at 3 per cent a year. If you want to check it, punch 18,000 into your calculator and keep multiplying by 1.03 until you've done it 20 times. Alternatively, multiply 18,000 by 1.03 to the power 20.</strong> </p> <p>I see. So how much extra will I have to contribute to be sure that inflation doesn't erode the value of my pension before I've even started spending it? </p> <p><strong> If you want a precise figure which takes charges into account, ask your pension company. But make sure you ask them for an illustration for the 20-years hence pension figure rather than your target income in today's money.</strong> </p> <p>Don't they do that automatically? </p> <p><strong> No. Only figures for 'protected-rights' pensions, which are those funded by contracting out of Serps (the state earnings-related pension) have to be given in real terms.</strong> </p> <p>What if I can't afford to pay any extra? </p> <p><strong> You can forget early retirement.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Control, freedom and choice are advantages that self-invested personal pensions, or Sipps, seem to have over other personal pensions. So why were there only 50,000 Sipps among the 6 million private pensions taken out last year, and will this change as online Sipps arrive? </p> <p>Sipps were introduced in 1989 to enable pension holders to manage their own investments. They can be used to build up a pension for retirement or, more traditionally, to house a fund set up after retirement. </p> <p>Sipps, like other personal pensions, are available to employees who are not in company schemes, to the self-employed and to partnerships. </p> <p>Thomas McPhail, pensions development manager for Wolverhampton-based financial adviser Torquil Clark says: 'Sipps would suit someone in their forties or fifties who wants to do something imaginative with their fund, and growth is tax free because it is in a pension fund. But you should have investment knowledge, or pay an adviser.' </p> <p>The choice of investments under Sipps is wide. Money can go directly into shares or collective investments such as unit trusts as well as into life insurance and commercial property. </p> <p>This means you don't have to place all your hard-earned cash with one provider, as you do with other personal pensions. You can diversify your investments to minimise risk, and take your pick of the best performers'z. </p> <p>Nick Bamford, managing director of Cranleigh-based financial adviser Informed Choice, which does a lot of Sipps business, says: 'Sipps give you control over your investment, something many people find appealing given current disillusionment with providers.' </p> <p>But they are perceived as expensive. There are set up charges, annual charges, fund management charges and trading charges - all of which can run into thousands of pounds, making small Sipps impractical. </p> <p>McPhail says: 'They are definitely for high net worth clients. You are looking at making monthly payments of \u00a3400 to \u00a3500 a month on top of a lump sum transfer value or one off payment of \u00a320,000.' </p> <p>He says if the Sipp is for an income drawdown plan - which allows you to keep your fund invested in the stock market after retirement while you draw an annual income from it - you need\u00a3100,000. </p> <p>But if you are seeking a spread of investments, you could consider a personal pension such as Skandia's which invests in a wide range of funds without the hassle of all the trading involved with Sipps. </p> <p>Bamford disagrees.'If you are using a Sipp for income drawdown, you will have to build up a substantial fund, he says. 'But the situation is different if you are building up a fund. It works out cheaper than taking out a pension through an insurance company.' </p> <p>Sipp charges do vary. Establishing a Sipp can cost anywhere between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000, while management fees can be as much as \u00a3500 a year. The trading fee is typically 1 per cent of the deal. </p> <p>Life insurer National Mutual's Sipp has a setting-up charge of \u00a3625 and an annual management fee of \u00a3400. If you trade yourself, it will cost you \u00a325 a shot. James Hay's Sipp has a setting-up fee of \u00a3290 and an annual management charge of \u00a3455. Trading costs a minimum of \u00a330 each time. </p> <p>However, it is launching a new Sipp through financial advisers on 1 November. Its Select Sipp rolls all the fees into an annual charge of 0.75 per cent. This translates into \u00a3750 on a \u00a3100,000 fund, plus commission agreed with the adviser. </p> <p>A new operation has stripped out all these costs by selling Sipps online. Sippdeal.co.uk is offering a Sipp whose only charge is the trading fee - between \u00a315 and \u00a330, depending on the size of the deal. It hopes to bring Sipps to a much wider audience. </p> <p>The minimum contribution is \u00a3150 a month on top of a lump sum investment of \u00a31,000. It is aimed at people who trade online. </p> <p>At present it is only possible to invest in shares through Sippdeal - 'though by early next year we will be offering a full range of unit trusts which will bypass this limitation,' says spokesman Fergus Lyons. </p> <p>National Mutual wants to make Sipps the mainstay of its business, and predicts that 500,000 people will have them by 2010, after forthcoming changes to the income drawdown rules make the plans transferable. </p> <p>Its head of Sipps marketing, Malcolm Gordon, says: 'Sipps are like buying madeto-measure clothes for the same price as off-the-peg ones. They offer good-quality investment services coupled with control, choice and the ability to negotiate on investments.' </p> <p>Sipps may be for you if you want more say in how your fund is managed. If you haven't the money for a bespoke service, there is now the cheaper online option. But you do need good investment knowledge - or a willingness to pay for it. </p> <p><strong>More information</strong></p> <p>National Mutual: 01462 422422 </p> <p>James Hay: 01722 338333</p>",
  "<p>The other day I was in a restaurant, eavesdropping on a couple having a leisurely, mid-week lunch. The woman's mobile phone rang. Her spoon was halfway to her mouth as she said: 'Yes, you can make tea and coffee in your room. Yes, they're all en-suite. Fifty pounds deposit usually, a cheque's fine'. After the call she said to her husband: 'I forgot to tell you, the hand basin in the pink room is blocked again'. </p> <p>Running your own business - whether it's a hotel or anything else - may give you flexibility, but mention the word 'freedom' to many owners of these enterprises and they're likely to respond with a hollow laugh. Yet surely it must feel great, calling the shots? You can put your mark on something, make decisions, choose who you work with, and take a break without needing to get your holiday form signed by the powers that be. </p> <p>When you are employed by someone else and your concentration lapses during the Monday morning meeting, you may find yourself dreaming again of that restaurant you'd really like to open, possibly in Devon, or maybe even in Cornwall? One day you'll do it. It would be a dream come true! </p> <p>Yet there are dreamers and doers. Galvanising yourself to hand in your notice, to give up a job that pays the bills and comes with four weeks' paid holiday is not for the fainthearted. </p> <p>Nevertheless, according to a recent NatWest survey, 440,000 new businesses were set up in 1999, the highest number for 10 years. Does that mean that the entrepreneurial spirit is on the up? Indeed, if the stereotypical Open All Hours culture of a small business owner may have previously put off the steady nine to fivers, in a world where working hours have been stretched beyond all recognition and with organisations in constant flux, perhaps more of the employed brigade are wondering whether they should give it a whirl? </p> <p>'It may be sensible to make sure you're in control of your destiny, rather than being in the hands of a multinational,' says David Boyle of the New Economics Foundation, a think-tank. </p> <p>Some people try their luck, but then have second thoughts, according to Andrew McDougall of Barclays Small Business Banking. 'People start out in a business venture, but then they might get a better offer of employment,' he says. </p> <p>Which may console the many people who are still toying with the idea of being mavericks, yet remain fearful about the financial precariousness associated with running a business: wages to pay and the ever-present threat of mounting debts and bankruptcy. </p> <p>'People have fear, and one of the things we put our fear on is money,' says Nick Williams, a former Eighties yuppie who gave up a highly paid job in computers to advise people how to find their ideal employment. 'Yet fear and money are different.' </p> <p>Williams, author of The Work You Were Born To Do , published by Element Books at \u00a39.99, says our belief in the work ethic can shackle us further if we run our own businesses: 'One of our beliefs is that we can only earn money through hard work, effort and struggle so we may make ourselves work harder when we are self-employed. You can end up being your own worst boss.' </p> <p>Yet self-employment is something that more and more of us are turning to as freelance and portfolio working becomes a more flexible and profitable option. Does that mean that anyone with a laptop can claim to run a small business? </p> <p>'For me, a business is something that has an intention to grow,' says Andrew James, publisher of Better Business magazine. 'Any business that is going to grow probably doubles in size by the end of the first year. And the only way that you can grow a business is by delegating.' </p> <p>James says it's important to recognise the difference between a business and a job: 'There are a number of people who start a business. There are many more who buy a job for themselves: they don't really see themselves as running a business.' </p> <p>So what makes people grasp the nettle? For some it's redundancy. For others it's a mid-life crisis - the 'there must be more to life' syndrome suffered after being in a job where one's creativity is stymied - can fuel a now-or-never attitude. </p> <p>Other people have a spirit shot through with an entrepreneurial, inventive streak. They have an idea and they want to make it work. Think Diane Keaton in Baby Boom. </p> <p>Whatever the initial motivation, you'll need energy, determination, a Zen-like philosophical outlook and passion.

  "<p>Jason Biggs became a youth icon last year by demonstrating the proper manner of making love to pastry in the comedy hit American Pie. An odd path to international stardom, maybe, but capitalising on his fame has not, so far, been easy. Biggs had the only good role in fizzless romantic comedy Boys and Girls (due for release in December), but even more vexing is Loser, written and directed by Clueless's Amy Heckerling and co-starring Pie-mate Mena Suvari. Loser stars Biggs as a nerdy university freshman who can't get anything in his life to work right. Unfortunately, little in the film did, either, Biggs' performance being a notable exception. </p> <p><strong>Most women seem to think you're just the cuddliest thing. How come you're so often cast as a guy who can't get a date? </strong></p> <p>I like to think that I have a sympathetic quality that the audience can root for, even while I'm playing an outcast. In order for American Pie to have worked, you had to have a character that, even while he is humping a pie, the audience still liked him; and in order for Loser to work, you have to have a guy who, even while he is the biggest outcast, is still likable. </p> <p><strong>More speci\u00decs on Mena, please. This is the second film you've made together.</strong></p> <p>Mena is great and completely unchanged by all the success of American Beauty and everything, which was hitting right when we started shooting this. She was very humble about it, and we had such a great time, always kidding around and laughing. There were a lot of inside jokes. I believe that our chemistry on screen is great, and I think that's because our chemistry off screen is great. </p> <p><strong>For whatever reason, though, Loser did pretty lousy when it was released in the US last summer. Did that bother you? </strong></p> <p>It would be foolish of me to take full responsibility for the movie, but at the same time, I'm very proud of it. So however the movie did, and whether or not it will impact on me or not, who knows? The only thing that I can control in the end is my performance. That's the only pressure that I feel, not so much for the film to succeed, because I am my own worst critic. </p> <p><strong>You seem to be working non-stop. Are you compulsive that way, or have you had time off we don't know about? </strong></p> <p>No, I stopped, but... American Pie came out, and so I travelled around the globe to do publicity for it, and then I came back and I started work on Boys And Girls and Loser, which I did at the same time. I finished that at the end of last January and I had a break. So then it was like, \"Alright, it's Jason time! I'm going to go snowboarding, and have fun!\" Then on my \u00derst trip snowboarding, I dislocated my shoulder really badly. So Jason time turned into recovery time; I spent three months in physical therapy and a month in a sling. Then I started my next two projects, Saving Silverman and Prozac Nation. </p> <p><strong>Let's go out on a cheery seasonal note, then. What was the best Halloween costume you've ever worn?</strong></p> <p>There were two. One was when I was a prostitute in the sixth grade. My mom helped me out with that one. She cut some tennis balls in half and got this crazy wig and, like, put on the lipstick and short skirt. I shouldn't say prostitute, that's kind of heavy, I was a girl; but if you saw me, you would think that I belonged in a brothel. And I was a baby in the fifth grade, the year before that. I had a big diaper with a big pin, and a big paci\u00deer. </p> <p><strong>Man, sounds like you really were a loser.</strong> </p> <p>No, that was cool! It was fun because I didn't have to leave for bathroom breaks.</p>",
  "<p>Can the red-eye be abolished forever? Can a night-flight be transformed from a punishing experiment in sleep deprivation into a travellers' treat, on a par with the old luxury night-trains of old? </p> <p>British Airways certainly hopes so. That's why it's equipped its club-class quarters with a perk that used to be confined to first: a flat-bed seat. Think of it as the latest offensive in the great furniture war of the air - a bed in the sky for every business-class passenger between London and New York. </p> <p>Personally, I couldn't resist. I've done that overnight run often, always in economy, emerging the next morning with aching limbs, matted hair, clingy trousers and a desperate need for slumber. Wouldn't it be great to dodge the entire experience by bedding down for the night at JFK and arriving in London fresh and ready for the new day? </p> <p>BA's new service is obsessed with achieving that outcome. Sleep is the goal, pursued relentlessly. There's pre-board dining in the newly-built Terraces lounge in JFK: that way you can eat first, wasting no valuable sleep time onboard. If you're one of those travellers who skids into the airport with seconds to spare - and no time for the lounge - then the on-board menu includes a sleep-well option (olive bread stuffed with beef and ricotta cheese, followed by hot chocolate and cookies). It's not so much food as a soporific. </p> <p>But the heart of the matter is the seat. It looks less like a chair than a pod. There are two seats in each unit, forming an S-shape - with a handy, fan-like screen to ensure no peeking between you and your neighbour (unless you want to). A TV screen swings out on a steel arm; there's a tiny little stand for cocktails as well as the regular tray table stowed in the seat arm. Also stashed away is a TV remote control, which doubles as a telephone, and a clutch of light-switches and gadgets. Once you've checked out all that lot - and the instruction manual is essential - you'll feel like Blofeld in a Bond movie. It's not a chair, it's a console. </p> <p>If you find cramped legroom the true curse of economy travel, your heart will leap when you see the footstool folded away in front of you. Unlock it and a neat pumping action raises or lowers it to just the right height. Press the recline button and you'll think yourself blessed: comfy chair, feet up - the perfect conditions for watching a movie or reading a book. </p> <p>But that's not the point. You must keep pressing the button and keep pressing some more. For the chair bends further and further back (forcing you to move your bottom, lest your backside gets trapped in the chair like a foot in an escalator). The electric movement takes the seat back to a full horizontal, until its front edge meets the footstool. Ta-da: it's a bed! </p> <p>The frequent fliers are unfazed by all this, of course; these blas\u00e9 habitues of business class know exactly what to do. They put away their Wall Street Journal before take-off, heading instead to the (larger than usual) bathroom where they swiftly change into sweatpants and cosy top (BA only provides the \"sleepsuit\" to first class). They don't eat on the plane, waving aside the offer of a menu, and they certainly don't drink. They don't bother unwrapping the headset or checking out the film guide. </p> <p>Instead, they curl up under the blanket, buckle their belt over the top (so the steward can see it, and won't wake them during turbulence), and drop off in an instant. It seems high-powered folk are focused about everything they do - even sleep. </p> <p>Within minutes, the cabin has the feel of a boarding-school dorm. The lights are dimmed, there are no announcements and all is quiet. And people are really asleep! Mouths are open, arms are dangling. No one snored on my flight but the business elite were definitely in the land of $500,000-a-year nod. (One cannot escape the suspicion that a few of them were getting a bit of chemical help: among the jetset, sleeping pills are the new coffee.) </p> <p>I, alas, was not among them. My chair was comfortable, and it was long enough even for me (at 6 ft 1). But somehow I was denied full unconsciousness. Normally I would blame that on the plane and the tiny seat. Now I know the truth: the seat is perfect - it's me who has to change. </p> <p>\u0095 A BA fully-flexible return ticket to New York costs \u00a33,743.

  "<p>Vienna is the grand capital of music. Hadyn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert all thrived in its bubbling coffee-house culture and came to pay court to the Habsburgs and to each other. Today along the Kartnerstrasse, Vienna's central shopping street, busy Viennese still hover patiently as buskers tune up. Even the mobile phones chime. </p> <p>Now is a good time to ride Vienna's trams around the Ringstrasse, looping the old city. The opera season is starting and, with Christmas approaching, Vienna lights up like a sparkler. </p> <p>But the home of so much pleasure is also the city of Freud and that artistic reject Hitler; a place that can still cast truly grotesque shadows. For an outsider Vienna can be over-rich to say the least and, on a weekend break, penetrating its charmed musical circle is as intimidating as the overmighty Hofburg palace. Fear not though, Vienna is actually remarkably easy to get around. </p> <p><strong> Tuning up</strong></p> <p> Buy a <strong> Vienna Card</strong> (\u00a39 for three days - from underground stations and tobacconists) for unlimited use of trams, subway and discounts to most museums. For anyone vaguely nervous of all that noise, there is only one place to start. Just three months old, Vienna's newest, slickest, most hi-tech museum, the <strong> Haus der Musik</strong>, is a revelation. It starts with a computerised introduction to the sounds of music and music of sounds, and ends in a futuristic playground of sonic massages and sound morphing. You can even conduct the Vienna Philharmonic courtesy of a computer program masterminded by the university of Linz. </p> <p>For a genuine insight into what made all those metronomes tick, the coupes de theatre <strong> </strong> are the walk-through biographies of Vienna's seven great composers, from \"Papa\" Hadyn to Mahler and the dissonance of the 20th-century Viennese School. They brilliantly weave their stories into the fabric of the city and show how music, beginning in the churches, moved to the court and aristocratic salons, then through Schubert's open-air gatherings to the all-popular waltzes of the Strausses, preparing the way, in the collapse of empire and two world wars, for the shattering atonalities of the 20th century. \"When you hear a sound you are also hearing the space in which it is made.\" It couldn't be truer than in Vienna. </p> <p>Haus Der Musik, Seilerstatte 30. (+4315164851 <a href=\"http://www.houseofmusic-vienna.at\">www.houseofmusic-vienna.at</a>). Open 10am-10pm daily. Adults \u00a35, family ticket \u00a311. </p> <p> Next stop the <strong> Hofburg </strong> palace and an exhibition of 16th-century musical instruments, not just to touch bass but as an introduction to the Habs burgs. The winter palace of the Holy Roman emperor Franz Joseph, who defined the staggering pomp and circumstance of the 19th- century city, the Hofburg lies at Vienna's epicentre. It symbolises how this capital of an empire, once uniting 56 million people in the heart of the European maelstrom, became such a glittering focus for art and culture. </p> <p>The Hofburg could take a weekend in itself but a must on a short trip is the Hofburg Chapel where every Sunday morning you can hear the Vienna Boys Choir. Make sure to get a seat near the front, otherwise you will have to peer at those angelic faces on a monitor. </p> <p> Instruments of the 16th Century - National Library in the Hofburg Palace, Innere Stadt. Open 10am-5.30am except Tuesday. \u00a32.50. </p> <p> If the Hofburg testifies to the importance of patrons, it is the composers who play on and, armed with enough anecdotes, Vienna's drama explodes in the places they frequented. I didn't know Beethoven was always running upstairs or that Mozart spent a third of his life in carriages. </p> <p>Everywhere you'll see plaques to Vienna's musical worthies, but two of the most important pilgrimage sites are the <strong> Pasqualati House</strong> and <strong> The Figaro House</strong> . Beethoven - who moved house 97 times - found a burgherish patron in Herr Pasqualati. The charming Figaro House lies in cobbled streets behind the all-imposing St Stephen's, the only surviving residence of Vienna's best loved visitor, Wolfgang Amadeus. Under the baroque ceiling in his bedroom you do get a real sense of Mozart's (or perhaps Peter Schaffer's) Vienna. Headphones and digital harpsichords allow you to indulge in some of the greatest works in situ. </p> <p>It was the commercially-minded Strausses who really began to exploit popular music with their celebrated waltzes. Although the Danube is not and never has been blue, as you will see from the tributary that now forms Vienna's famous canal, you will hear the strains of waltzes everywhere. Vienna's ball season starts again too in November, although it doesn't reach its peak until January and February. </p> <p> PasqualatiHaus, Molkerbastei 8. FigaroHaus, Domgasse 5. Johann Strauss Memorial Rooms, Praterstrasse 54. All open 9am-12.15pm, 1pm-4.30pm Tues- Sun. Closed Jan 1, May 1 &amp; Dec 25. </p> <p><strong> Nights at the opera</strong><br> </p> <p> The two main concert halls are the <strong> Musikverein</strong> (1 B\u00f6sendorferstrasse 12, tel: 505 8190) and the <strong> Konzerthaus </strong> (3 Lothringerstrasse 3, tel: 712 1211), home of the Vienna Philharmonic and Symphony orchestras. </p> <p>But the high altar of musical culture is the splendid <strong> Staatsoper </strong> (1 Opernring 2, tel: 5144 42960), completely rebuilt in 1945. Sometimes, the humourless Viennese could do with the Marx brothers around, but for me there was no greater thrill than watching those deep-red curtains rise on a production of Verdi's Enani, as well-dressed Viennese showed their love, knowledge and appreciation in one of the world's greatest opera houses. Of course, seats are expensive but you can stand for around \u00a35 - if you can get tickets. </p> <p>Try, too, the <strong> Volksoper</strong> (9 W\u00e4hringerstrasse 78, tel: 51 444) - the People's Opera. Far more relaxed, it still reaches a high standard and you are more likely to hear the strains of Figaro or Don Giovanni drifting through the doors. </p> <p>For tickets to everything theatrical and musical, go to the Bundestheatrekassen (1 Hanuschgasse 3, down from the opera house, tel:5144 42960). </p> <p><strong> Tone deaf</strong><br> </p> <p> If music isn't your thing, Vienna has plenty of other attractions. It is a city of theatres and museums, 90 in fact. A reason to go now is the exhibition in the <strong> Belvedere</strong> of Klimt's Women; a banquet of the painter's rich, jewelled colours, and decadent sensuality. To escape take a boat along the canal and loop out into the Danube. </p> <p> Klimt's Women, Belvedere, Landstrasse. Until Jan 7. Open 10am-6pm except Mondays. Thurs to 7pm. \u00a35. <a href=\"http://www.klimt-frauen.at\">www.klimt-frauen.at</a>.</p> <p> In Vienna, even the horses love to dance and though it's difficult to get tickets you can watch them training in the mornings at the<strong> Spanish Riding School </strong> (Hofburg, Josefplatz). </p> <p>Fiakers, Vienna's famous horse-drawn carriages, are very expensive and far better value is a personal guided tour. </p> <p>For some darker notes, try the <strong> Prater Park</strong> and the sounds of the funfair. From the famous Ferris wheel where Harry Lime spills the beans in The Third Man you can gaze out across the city, over to the UN building, housing among other things the Drug Control Agency. For film buffs there is also a guided tour down to the sewers, called The Return of The Third Man (tel: 585 6455). </p> <p><strong> Where to eat</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Vienna</strong> is almost as famous for food as music. The <strong> Sacher Hotel</strong> (1 Philharmonikerstrasse 4, behind the Opera House, tel: 514 560) invented the sachertorte (chocolate cake) for Prince Metternich, and everywhere windows groan with pastries, puddings and sweets. This is all most pleasurable in the city's numerous coffee houses. </p> <p>Several boast musical associations but my favourites are the pink-fronted <strong> Caf\u00e9 Diglas</strong> (1, Wollzeile 10, tel: 512 8401), and <strong> Hawelka</strong> (1 Dorotheerhasse 6, tel: 512 8230), still frequented by artists and musicians. </p> <p>The tourist board has an excellent booklet of concert-caf\u00e9s. </p> <p><strong> Caf\u00e9 Landtmann</strong> (1 Dr-Karl-Lueger-Ring 4, tel: 532 0621) was a favourite of Freud's and is great for music. </p> <p>You shouldn't leave Vienna without trying tafelspitz , a delicious Viennese beef stew, best at <strong> Plachutta </strong> (1 Wollzeile 38, tel: 512 1577). For lunch, <strong> Hansen</strong> (1 Wipplingerstrasse 34 in the basement of the Stock Exchange, tel: 532 0542) is trendy, the <strong> Cantino</strong> (at the top of the Haus der Musik) good, while <strong> Zum Zwarzen Kameel</strong> (1 Bognergasse 5, tel: 533 8967) is famous for its reislings and a still-unpaid bill of Beethoven's. </p> <p>If you are going to the opera, be careful because Vienna seems to close suprisingly early. However, there is a good restaurant right opposite the Volksoper and several places to eat next to the Staatsoper. <strong> Corso</strong> (1 Hotel Bristol, Mahlerstrasse 2, tel: 5151 6546) is wonderful if you are really pushing the boat out, but for an after-opera meal go next door. <strong> Drei Husaren</strong> (1 Weihburggasse 4, tel: 5121 0920) is another famous upmarket restaurant, while <strong> Barbaro's</strong> (1 K\u00e4rtner Strasse 19, tel: 513 1712) at the top of a modern department store is not expensive and has great views. A traditional pre-opera tipple is a glass of champagne at the <strong> Reiss Bar (</strong> Marco D'aviano-Gasse 1). </p> <p>For some real life and the street culture that fed all that genius, try the student bars around Juden Strasse. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p> As everything happens in the charmed inner circle, district number 1 is the only place to stay. Our hotel the <strong> Romischer-Kaiser</strong> (1 Rathausstrasse 17, just next to the Haus Der Musik, tel: 512 7751) is both comfortable and elegant. </p> <p>Another delightful though expensive hotel is <strong> K\u00f6nig Von Ungarn</strong> - The King of Hungary (1 Schulerstrasse 10, tel: 515 84, doubles around \u00a3120). With a lovely inner courtyard it is next to Mozart's house and the Caf\u00e9 Diglas just round the corner. </p> <p>For somewhere cheaper, try <strong> Drei Kronen</strong> (Schleifm\u00fchlgasse 25, tel: 710 1919, doubles \u00a344 per night) in the unmissable Naschmarkt, Vienna's most exciting market. </p> <p>\u0095 David Clement-Davies' novel Fire Bringer is published in paperback by Macmillan at \u00a35.99.</p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Inghams Eurobreak (020-8780 7700, <a href=\"http://www.inghams.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.inghams.co.uk</a>) offers two nights at the four-star Hotel Romischer Kaiser for \u00a3172 per person including Buzz return flights from Stansted and a free Dorling Kindersley guidebook worth \u00a314.99. Tickets for the Volksoper (\u00a314-\u00a361) and Staatsoper (\u00a317-\u00a3165) and the half-day city tour (\u00a322pp) can be booked in advance through Inghams.</p>",
  "<p>In the brochure the chalet looked idyllic. It was framed by thick lusty pine trees topped with generous dollops of snow. Inside a log fire blazed. It was a short walk from the slopes, where a small gondola took you to the main ski station at Courchevel 1850. </p> <p>Unlike the functional but unattractive hub of the Trois Vall\u00e9es, we were staying in Courchevel 1550 - one of the five components of the resort that link to the 600km of pistes. Down the mountain from the jet-setting Courchevel 1850, we were in a small, quiet and attractive village, ideal for families and substantially cheaper. </p> <p>A short gondola ride or alternatively a regular bus service were all that separated the two areas - that is until it started to snow, and snow and snow. Later that night we watched the snow build on the balcony, and as the flakes grew to the size of a fist and the wind started to howl our first concerns set in. </p> <p>The next morning all was quiet, there was no hum from the gondola, our essential link to the main ski area, and the buses had stopped running. Eventually, a short Poma lift was opened, but it didn't go anywhere, all it did was justify the price of a lift ticket. We were well and truly cut off. </p> <p>In New York City, any real estate agent will tell you that the three most important factors to take into account when looking for accommodation are location, location, location. The same could well apply to ski resorts. Sadly though, the most attractive resorts may not have the best skiing or reliable public transport, while the most convenient may not be attractive. In many cases it comes down to what you are prepared to pay. </p> <p>Many of the purpose-built resorts are popular because they offer location and convenience at affordable prices. This doesn't mean that you should forego the pretty villages where the smell of manure wafts through the narrow cobbled streets and 400-year-old chalets groan from the passing of time, but that you should choose your alpine hideaway with care. </p> <p>In Austria, where many traditional alpine villages have barely changed and hotels have been modernised or expanded in good taste, there are many resorts that combine convenience, and an attractive village, and a few that can add excellent skiing to the list. </p> <p>In Switzerland, beware the antiquated four-star hotel. Last year, I went to Villars for the first time and found it a delightful location, with excellent skiing. But the so called four-star hotels, while meeting international standards, were tired and badly in need of renovation. </p> <p>Italian resorts such as Courmayeur and Cortina D'Ampezzo have it all, but there are many other attractive Italian centres such as Livigno and Gressoney where you can find charm and good, albeit mostly, intermediate skiing. In France you'll find the purpose-built resort as the gateway to many of the largest ski areas. </p> <p><strong> Pretty Alpbach, Austria</strong></p> <p> The classic chocolate-box village with old wooden chalets, a small attractive church, narrow streets, and two 16th-century hotels run by the same family for several generations. The skiing is mostly intermediate on the Wiedersbergerhorn reached by a free shuttle bus. It's typically Tyrolean - expect cream teas, lederhosen and accordion players rather than tequila slammers and hip-hop. </p> <p><strong> Who goes there: </strong></p> <p><strong>Crystal Holidays</strong> 0870 848 7000 <br><strong> Inghams </strong> 020-8780 4444 <br><strong> Made to Measure </strong> 01243 533333 <br><strong> Meg\u00e8ve, France</strong> </p> <p> An exclusive and chic resort that attracted the likes of Brigitte Bardot, Roger Vadim and other celebrities in the 1960s.

We used to toboggan down the main road but no one seemed to mind. Many years on, it hasn't changed.

Those built in the 1960s are the ugliest, such as Aime La Plagne and Plagne Centre. Those built later - at Plagne 1800, Plagne Villages and Plagne Soleil - are less forbidding. The most popular is Belle Plagne which has an attractive town centre. These centres or satellites do represent some of the best ski-in ski-out convenience, which for families is a major selling point. One way to get away from the architectural eyesore is to find a secluded chalet. </p> <p><strong>Who goes there: </strong> <br></p> <p><strong> Ski Beat</strong> 01243 780 405 <br><strong> Simply Ski</strong> 020-8541 2209 <br><strong> Erna Low </strong> 020-7584 2841 <br> <strong> Flaine, France</strong> </p> <p> Flaine is a 1960s example of Bauhaus architecture. Its massive concrete buildings, designed to mirror the shadow and light of their surroundings, are enough to make any prospective skiers' heart sink.

Tignes is not a good family resort and the public transport is frequent but crowded, but it's one of the best locations for ski-in ski-out accommodation and the skiing is sensational. No matter what conditions are like, there is always the Grande Motte glacier which is open all year and together with Val d'Is\u00e8re it's the easiest access to the 300km of pistes.

  "<p>Lock up your daughters, sons, livestock and power tools, because the floodgates are open. After decades of holding back the tidal wave of sex and violence, Britain is now undergoing a veritable frenzy of liberalisation.</p> <p>Once we took pride in our reputation as the repression capital of Europe, but virtually every film you were never allowed to see has suddenly emerged from hibernation. \"Hardcore\" porn videos can now be bought over the counter instead of over the Channel; historical scandalisers like The Story Of O, Salo and In the Realm of the Senses are all enjoying a renaissance. </p> <p>Former gore shockers like Texas Chainsaw Massacre are now material for primetime rather than municipal incinerators. Graphic sex is writhing its way onto the big screen, and the small screen too, as FilmFour prepares to broadcast Catherine Breillat's highbrow sexathon Romance in November.</p> <p>Not that any of this should necessarily be reason to rejoice. For one thing, these liberties have had to be wrested from the hands of the moral minority, and for another, not all of these films were necessarily worth banning, or watching, in the first place. </p> <p>Ever since Jack The Ripper caught sight of an exposed table leg and was impelled to embark on a Victorian killing spree, the link between provocative images and real-world side effects has taken a powerful hold in this country. Our moral custodians have unerringly erred on the side of caution, seizing anything remotely perturbing with a vigilance bordering on the fanatical, and justifying their actions legally with grey terms like \"corrupt\" and \"deprave\". </p> <p>So what's changed? About four years ago, police informed the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) that material being released as R18 (ie hardcore porn) was actually too tame to merit the description, and therefore misleading. New guidelines were half implemented, but then Jack Straw entered the Home Office and effectively reversed the process. </p> <p>A ping-pong match of appeals, refusals and judicial reviews ensued, and to everyone's surprise, the courts ruled that watching sex on TV really didn't harm many people (repetitive strain injury aside). \"We don't sit in our ivory tower and say what people should watch,\" says Sue Clark of the BBFC, which recently undertook an extensive public survey. \"We still have some of the strictest censorship rules in the world, but now we effectively accept that adults should be allowed to decide what they want to watch.\"</p> <p>So here we are, officially relaxed and eager to watch anything we once couldn't. As any record producer knows, an official ban is the best publicity one could hope for, which explains why any film with a vague whiff of scandal attached to it is now being sprung from the vaults. </p> <p>To put the record straight, though, the BBFC does not \"ban\" films. It classifies them, or doesn't as the case may be, and local authorities decide whether or not to screen them. This was the case with \"cult erotic dramas\" like The Story Of O, a kinky confection of Ferrero Rocher styling and consensual sado-masochism that caused a stir in 1975 and finally received a UK release this year. </p> <p>Director Just Jaeckin, who also directed the equally notorious Emmanuelle (which received a certificate, with cuts), has fond but vague memories of the film: \"For me, it was a beautiful story about love. It was not corrupting or pornographic, it was a fantasy, like Alice In Wonderland. But erotic, of course.\" </p> <p>While it's unlikely The Story Of O or Emmanuelle could have corrupted anyone, it's also quite a stretch to imagine that they could have aroused anyone either. Apart from crimes against interior design, the only real reason to suppress them was so that bands like Air could rip off their soundtracks undetected.</p> <p>Jaeckin's films did, however, show others the way to get sex onto cinema screens: make your film foreign and try to have some kind of plot. \"Arthouse\" has always been a way of evading the censors' scissors. Nagisa Oshima's In The Realm Of The Senses was passed in 1991 (only a 15-year wait), and the old erect-penis taboo was later lifted for Lars Von Trier's The Idiots, and Leos Carax's Pola X. </p> <p>Catherine Breillat's Romance, in many ways an updated Emmanuelle, has as many erections as an R18 film, but was passed for cinema release virtually uncut. Pasolini's Salo has fared less well. Despite impeccable arthouse credentials, its blend of perverted sex, sadistic violence and coprophilia went down as well as an excrement souffle with the authorities, despite the fact that its themes of repression, consumption and sexuality were serious-minded.</p> <p>Currently up for reclassification, it was seized by police when shown uncut at a Soho cinema in 1977 - narrowly staving off a nationwide outbreak of faeces-eating. </p> <p>The only films truly banned in the UK were the infamous \"video nasties\" of the 80s. In this instance, the Department of Public Prosecutions stepped in to staunch the Betamax bloodbath which the BBFC was powerless to stop, and prosecuted about 60 films, including future classics such as The Driller Killer, The Evil Dead and Andy Warhol's Flesh For Frankenstein (Texas Chainsaw Massacre was not on the list, although it had been refused a certificate since 1975). </p> <p>The \"but horror films are supposed to be scary\" argument didn't wash; a racy title or a lurid cover was enough (like the relatively tame I Miss You Hugs And Kisses, unwisely tagged \"for those who like their sex with a lot of violence\"). </p> <p>In the sober light of the 21st century, the majority of these low-budget splatterdramas are more hilarious than disgusting - such as Forest Of Fear, in which hippies become zombies after the FBI sprays their weed with an experimental herbicide, or Night Of The Demon, in which a victim is disembowelled by bigfoot, then whipped with his own intestines in slow motion. </p> <p>There are still many uncertified titles, some of which are unlikely to ever see the light of day, but others only remain \"banned\" because they are so bad nobody has bothered to re-submit them. Despite our new climate of acceptance, censorship is still full of contradictions. </p> <p>We are legally allowed to have sex at 16, but must wait another two years to see it on a screen. We are allowed to buy R18 videos but not receive them by mail, or bring them from abroad. And what we consider 18-certificate material, our European counterparts regularly classify as 15 or even 12. European porn producers still tone down their films for the UK market. </p> <p>Perhaps another side-effect of this liberation is the consequences for eroticism as opposed to pornography. With a rising background-smut count - thanks to increasingly sexualised advertising, television, magazines - pornography is scuttling up the hardcore ladder into bizarre, almost medical realms. If there's a relationship between what is forbidden and what is erotic, we're heading for an age of tedious sexual ubiquity, where everything is permitted and nothing is exciting. </p> <p>Perhaps we're overcompensating for all those years of repression and in a few years, as has happened with violence in films, we'll reach saturation - and start campaigning for less sex on our screens. </p> <p>Texas Chainsaw Massacre, 11.45pm, Sat, C4; In The Realm of the Senses is on limited release; Salo is showing at the ICA and NFT in London; The Story Of O is out on DVD and video on Monday</p> <p><strong>Reel shockers</strong><br>Five \u00delms the censors still don't want you to see</p> <p>Cannibal Holocaust (Ruggero Deodato, 1979)<br>The gory effects were so realistic Deodato had to go to court to prove it was fake.

  "<p>The notice by the museum entrance said: \"Iranians 500 tumans, Foreigners 5,000.\" Ali, my guide, interpreter and general fixer was asking the unshaven attendant in the kiosk for tickets. </p> <p>\"One Iranian and one foreigner.\" </p> <p>The official looked puzzled. \"Where's the foreigner?\" </p> <p>Ali pointed to me. </p> <p>\"Oh, I thought that was your Iranian grandfather.\" </p> <p>I was wondering whether to be offended by the insult - surely I don't look ancient and decrepit enough to be the grandfather of an overweight 26-year-old - when the ticket-seller addressed me in such fast colloquial Persian that, though my command of the language is better than it has any right to be after 30 years of disuse, I couldn't quite catch his drift. Before I could stop myself, I had cupped my hand to my ear and, in the quavering, piping voice of an old, deaf and stupid grandfather, was asking: \"What? What?\" </p> <p>\"You ... are ... welcome ... Sir,\" the man said very slowly, loudly and patronisingly. \"May ... you ... never ... be ... weary!\" It's a common enough Persian greeting, but he seemed to me to say it more pointedly than necessary. I consoled myself with the thought that I had saved myself 4,500 tumans (about $25) . Over the next 10 days, as we toured the country in Ali's clapped-out Fiat, playing the Iranian grandfather was to save me a lot more money, as well as getting me into the kind of cheap lodging-house that wasn't willing to take foreigners. This was lucky, since I was visiting the country at a time of year when most decent hotels are full. </p> <p>Having come to Iran to look at pre-Islamic sites for a book about the ancient Persian prophet Zoroaster, I particularly wanted to witness the Persian New Year celebrations, still strongly Zoroastrian in tone in spite of nearly 1,300 years of Islam. This is the most popular holiday of the Iranian year and the Lonely Planet Guide suggested that it was not the best time for a visit: \"You should seriously consider avoiding Iran altogether for about 10 days before and after Noruz, the chaotic Iranian New Year, which starts on or about 21st March.\" </p> <p>Ignoring this advice, my plan was to spend 10 days driving in a great circle around the country. Iran is a difficult country to travel in. Neither trains nor planes seem to serve the most sought-after destinations, and I had no idea of the condition of the roads. It was going to be touch and go whether I would make it back to Tehran in time for my return flight and my daughter's birthday back home. </p> <p>The start was inauspicious. Daylight-saving time began the day I arrived, and I dutifully set my watch forward. The next morning we were to set off at six, but Ali was more than an hour late. He laughed when I pointed to the clock on the hotel lobby wall. \"We don't work for the government,\" he protested. \"And the Mullahs don't control the sun.\" </p> <p>Nor, it seems, the roads. After two hours' playing dodgem through Tehran's insane morning traffic I was genuinely relieved to find myself still alive. No self-respecting Iranian driver will forego overtaking just because another vehicle is coming the other way. Two lanes are expected to accommodate three cars, or even trucks, abreast, even if it means scraping through, hooting like mad, with only inches to spare on either side. </p> <p>Starting out, you can't help holding your breath and gripping the seat, white knuckled, at the hairiest moments. But there is a limit to the number of times you can brace yourself for certain death. In the end you learn to say, with the Iranians, Masha'allah: whatever God wills. </p> <p>Our first, 500-mile drive south through the rolling desert took us to the oasis city of Yazd, with its unique skyline of tall wind towers, designed to catch any faint breaths of breeze and funnel them down into secret retreats at the heart of the huddle of mud-brick houses. We spent the next day visiting Yazd's spectacular mosques, its prison attributed to Alexander the Great and its Zoroastrian fire-temple, packed during Noruz with Iranian tourists craning to catch a sight, through the protective glass, of the sacred fire which has been burning continuously since AD 470, though not in this same place. </p> <p>A few years ago after a great windstorm, Yazdis were amazed to see the top of a dome peek out of the sand just outside town. Much digging exposed an entire buried village, perfectly preserved, complete with a fire-temple of its own. During our visit, a local family party arrived. The father, who seemed to have insider knowledge, was lecturing his wife and daughter about Zoroastrian beliefs in the wildly theatrical style Iranians use when reciting verse - drawling out the long vowels as if eating them, peppering each sentence with sudden loud phrases or unexpectedly ... slowing ... right ... down. I whispered to Ali that this must surely be a schoolteacher by trade. The man heard me and turned on us. </p> <p>\"Were you speaking English?\" </p> <p>Ali confessed. The man pointed at me. </p> <p>\"Is he British? Because there are some things that should not be spoken in front of some people.\" </p> <p>\"Well,\" Ali told him, \"he carries a British passport, but his family came from Czechoslovakia and he himself was born in Vienna.\" </p> <p>The schoolteacher looked at me a little more benignly. \"Then his sins are diminished.\" </p> <p>Afterwards I said to Ali \"I thought it was the Americans who were the Great Satan.\" </p> <p>\"Oh no,\" he explained, \"Iranians believe that the Americans are good people at heart but innocent and na\u00efve. It is always the British who command them to do bad things.\" </p> <p>The first threat to our tight schedule came on my third Iranian night. All hotels in Yazd being full, we were sleeping on the living room floor of a local man's basement flat. Generously hospitable like all Iranians, he brought out a hookah and a brace of bottles of wine for his guests. </p> <p>\"Alcohol? Isn't that against the law?\" </p> <p>\"I don't drink it for enjoyment, only for health,\" he emphasised, as if that made all the difference. \"Anyway, it's not made from grapes, but from pomegranates and honey.\" The first taste confirmed that nobody could drink it for enjoyment. </p> <p>The resulting hangovers delayed our next day's departure south over the mountains until noon, so that it was too dark to see anything by the time we reached Cyrus the Great's tomb at Pasagard and the spectacular remains of Persepolis, the summer capital founded by Darius and burned by Alexander. My executive decision was to press on to Shiraz and return again very early the next morning. </p> <p>Even at 10 o'clock, Shiraz, elegant city of palaces, poets and perfumed gardens, was like a madhouse. All of Iran seemed to have congregated there for Noruz. Festive crowds pressed along the decorated streets, while gaily-dressed wedding parties, the women's black chadors barely concealing their finery, crammed on to the backs of lorries and paraded through the city centre, shouting and hooting and blaring raucous wind instruments. </p> <p>After two hours of fruitless driving around to find a vacant hotel room, Ali regretfully conceded that we would have to make do with a common lodging house. He found the Heavenly Guesthouse near the central glittering Sayyed Mir Ahmad shrine but came out looking gloomy. </p> <p>\"You won't like it,\" he said. </p> <p>I didn't. The tiny room, with space only for a double bed and a washbasin, was so filthy that Ali suggested we avoid undressing. The smell of urine forced us to leave the window open, and rowdy wedding parades outside kept us awake till three. It was no hardship to be up again and ready to leave town at five. </p> <p>Lost time was impossible to make up, however. Though we were back shortly after seven at Cyrus's movingly simple and dignified tomb, the entrance gates to the site were locked and, in spite of my offer of money and Ali's improbable claims of high political influence, a dishevelled and bad-tempered official refused us admission for nearly two hours. </p> <p>Late that night, we were 200 miles behind schedule when exhaustion forced us to stop in a small town on the road, at a guest house which proved to be, if anything, even more awful than the one in Shiraz. </p> <p>In the morning I asked Ali the name of the place. \"I want to be sure never to come here again.\" </p> <p>\"Beh-behan,\" he said. \"Literally, it means 'Used-to-be-better'.\" </p> <p>Driving on that night into the hours of darkness turned our careering descent to the oilfields of Mesopotamia into an awesome light show. Gigantic gas flares sprang from the ground on all sides, painting the entire sky a flickering rose red, as if we were entering the gates of Hell. It was almost a surprise to arrive unscathed in the cool modern urbanity of the great oil town of Ahwaz. </p> <p>Next day, it was an even greater surprise to be thoroughly frisked on leaving the slick shopping mall by the banks of the Karun river, though Ali took the indignity for granted. \"Otherwise people would steal things,\" he said. </p> <p>But even Ali was taken aback when the best hotel in town refused to change my dollars at a respectable rate, on the grounds that some of them were more than a year old. The cashier claimed to be worried. \"Perhaps they are not valid any more.\" </p> <p>I suggested that the day that two-year-old dollar bills went out of date, the world economy might as well close down. \"Why?\" he asked. \"Here we change our money all the time.\" </p> <p>By the time we had reached the nine o'clock position in our 360 degree circumnavigation of the country, we were falling ever more behind schedule. We had to press on far into the night to reach Shush, the site of Susa, one of oldest and longest-lasting of ancient Iran's cities - and one that took the brunt of the enemy onslaught during the Iran-Iraq war. The dusty hill of ruins which was once the biblical Shushan stands opposite the supposed tomb of the Prophet Daniel, the forecourt of which - for the benefit, I suppose, of Jewish pilgrims - is daubed with a huge savage mural, in uncannily Belfast-like style, showing heroic Muslims capturing Jerusalem. Close by is a gruesome blood-and-guts exhibition memorialising the martyrs to Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>Leaving the ancient mound, I was so affected by this combination of ruthlessness and horror that I quite forgot my Iranian grandfather role - until three angry men came running up to stop us in the street. Too late, I realised that I had been speaking English. </p> <p>\"You didn't say you were with a foreigner when you bought tickets,\" their spokesman accused Ali aggressively. </p> <p>\"You didn't ask.\" </p> <p>\"Foreigners must pay 10,000 tumans.\" </p> <p>Ali was squaring up for an argument. \"There is no sign that says so.\" </p> <p>The two others were beginning to look belligerent. I feared they might call the police and that I would never get back to Tehran in time to catch my plane. </p> <p>\"Pay them the money and let's go,\" I said. </p> <p>Ali did, but with ill grace. \"It's $57. You know the money will go straight into their pockets.\" </p> <p>\"But I don't want to miss my daughter's birthday.\" </p> <p>By driving through the night, we somehow managed to visit the carved cliffsides near Kermanshah and the ancient city of Hamadan as planned, and still arrive back in Tehran on the right day. With huge relief I checked in at Mehrabad airport well on time. </p> <p>The check-in clerk looked sombre. \"I am sorry,\" he said. \"Your flight is being diverted via Baku. You are going to miss your connection to London. The airline will pay for your overnight hotel in Dubai.\" </p> <p>I protested, of course. But this time there was absolutely nothing I could do. </p> <p>\u0095 In Search of Zarathustra, Paul Kriwaczek's look at the influence of the ancient Persian prophet on world religions, will be published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in 2001.</p> <p><strong> Visa</strong><br> </p> <p> You can apply for a tourist visa at the Iranian consulate in London (Kensington Court, London W8, tel: 020-7937 5225), for a non-returnable fee of \u00a340.

Tea is the preferred drink in Iran and very good. </p> <p><strong> Travel</strong><br> </p> <p> Buses are extremely cheap. The journey from Tehran in the north to Shiraz in the south, about 550 miles, costs around $2. A car with a driver will cost anything from $25 to $100 a day. But away from his home, you will have to pay for the driver's food and accommodation. </p> <p><strong> Overall cost</strong><br> </p> <p> My 10 days in Iran cost $1,500 overall plus the air fare. It was definitely worth it. </p> <p><strong> Feasibility</strong><br> </p> <p> Forget the TV images of chanting fanatics - that's merely political window-dressing. Iranians are friendly and welcoming, a highly civilised and cultured people with a longer and more distinguished history than almost any other nation - 2,500 years of it. The country is a treasure chest of magnificent architecture and fabulous antiquities. In spite of what one might expect from a theocracy, Iranian Islam is mostly tolerant and Iranian democracy has free and fair elections, though from a limited list.

  "<p>Yesterday's third-quarter US GDP figures must come as a relief to the policymakers at the Federal Reserve. With a tight labour market and an annualised second-quarter figure of 5.6% the Fed was under pressure. Some argued its chairman Alan Greenspan was losing the touch that has elevated him to near legendary status. Others that he was allowing Opec to do the Fed's dirty work for it through an escalating oil price. Certainly, given the closeness of the presidential election, the Fed had little room for manoeuvre on interest rates. </p> <p>In the event, yesterday's figure of 2.7% must have been as good as the Fed dared hope. It was undoubtedly a great deal better than Wall Street had been expecting. With the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq now well below their overvalued peaks and evidence that the economy is slowing Mr Greenspan might claim to be viewed as a man who kept his nerve rather than one who had lost the plot. </p> <p>Well, maybe. One swallow does not make a summer, nor one set of GDP figures a soft landing. Even within yesterday's numbers there is cause for concern. It is business, rather than the consumer, which is spending less. That 2.7% would look more benign if the emphasis was the other way round. And while US share prices have pulled back from earlier scary heights, recent volatility shows they could yet deliver a destabilising shock. </p> <p>So far, so good, then, Mr Greenspan. But there is still a long way to go - far enough indeed to make yesterday's talk of lower US interest rates look singularly premature. </p> <p><strong> Time to decide </strong><br> </p> <p>It has been the most delicious of ironies - a hostile bid for a stock exchange. But now day 46 has come and gone and with it OM's last chance to raise its offer for the London Stock Exchange. All that remains is for shareholders to choose and for the votes to be counted. It is too early to be certain but at this stage it looks as if OM has shot its bolt. </p> <p>Many in the City have been impressed by the OM campaign. Sadly for the Swedes they may well have persuaded shareholders that more value can be wrung out of the exchange than either the incumbent management has yet achieved (not difficult) or that they themselves have put on the table. But if exchange shareholders do spurn the Swedish overtures - as they should - what then? The stock exchange has, finally, shown a degree of energy and robust thinking in its defence against OM. </p> <p>What is clear is that if it does escape the bid it cannot rest on its laurels. The exchange needs a strategy to meet the demands of the big players in the equities game. That will mean, at the very least, new partners, new relationships. At the same time it needs to keep the smaller broker-shareholders on board. That is not impossible. </p> <p>But the exchange will need to be more aware, more astute and more diplomatic than it has been in the past if it is to prevent a tranche of the membership turning luddite. Otherwise it may find another bidder on the doorstep or, worse still, that it turns into a wallflower at the bourses ball watching its business waltz away. </p> <p><strong> Clever lender </strong><br> </p> <p>A top-of-the-cycle air is hanging over the mortgage market: house prices have topped out, the government is worried about \"irresponsible lending\" and lenders are getting cleverer. Maybe too clever. </p> <p>Commonwealth Bank of Australia has joined the growing list of lenders offering \"flexible\" mortgages which allow homeowners to overpay or underpay their mortgages according to their personal circumstances. </p> <p>These also present a seductive temptation: get into financial difficulties, and stop payments for a couple of months. Before long the mortgage is an overdraft facility. </p> <p>Dangerous stuff given that total consumer debt has jumped by a quarter in the past three years; the savings ratio is at its lowest level since the Lawson boom. The likelihood of these new style loans being paid off early rather than late is low. </p> <p>The sister product to flexible mortgages is all-in-one accounts - current account, mortgage, savings and credit card all wrapped into one. On paper they work fine but again the house becomes a cheque book. </p> <p>Such schemes are highly popular in Australia - one in three Aussies run them - yet Commonwealth Bank is hesitant about bringing them to Britain although Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and other banks are known to be considering new launches shortly. </p> <p>On Monday a government-ordered \"debt summit\" will take place. While this new market should not be choked off, it may be time to ensure lenders make clear the downside to these enticing products, and put in place controls to check that individuals do not use them to spiral further into debt.</p>",
  "The brief is for two minutes at the outside: and it must be topical. I make the half-hour drive to the local radio studio, arriving at 6.35 in the morning. My slot is at 6.45 and, passing through the empty city centre, I feel sure that this Topical Thought, which I am happy to do, remains in the schedule purely as a sop to the church lobby. <p>To present something broadly religious at 6.45am is safe for the radio station because very few people are listening. But at midnight last night, I sat mouthing my 360 words to a stopwatch like a silent madman in a forgotten corner of a mental ward. </p> <p>In the studio, I do my bit with all the energy I can muster. I have remembered that, to one listener, I am an intimate companion as they surface from the deep bliss of sleep. To another, I am a distant voice to accompany the morning thunder of the plumbing, or a watery burble as lather is scraped from a face. To others, I am a background to the crunch of cornflakes, or a noise in the car, droning on as they reverse into the road. </p> <p>Some of my friends think I am mad to make this 36-mile drive for just two minutes on the wireless. A 6.45 slot certainly is marginalised - and what can you say in such a short time? </p> <p>God does not get much of a profile on our local breakfast show but, up and down the country, the picture varies widely. Some stations still have a God slot every day; in others, the contribution is appreciated so much that it gets replayed later in the show. Whatever happens, I am also aware that even if only 500 people are listening, it is still far more than many clergy see on Sunday. And even at 6.45am, I am keeping the rumour of God alive on a weekday. </p> <p>But what can I say in that significant 360 words? Nobody wants to hear a theological treatise or a sermon. But more will identify with my Christian perspective than any producer dares imagine. I cannot moralise or evangelise, and, in truth, I do not want to do either - although the station manager probably fears I might. Harassed managers, qualified to analyse listener figures and sum up the opposition, are often out of touch with the spiritual need of their constituents. </p> <p>Equally, there will be those within the church ready to dismiss my efforts savagely with, \"You'd think the Cross never happened\" or \"Why won't he just talk straight about sin and justification?\" </p> <p>The answer is that these short \"thought\" slots are still a gift to the church and other faith communities prepared to train people to deal with them properly. They are not given for use as free advertising space, for proselytism or idealistic propaganda. They must be used for one simple purpose: to make people think. </p> <p>People of faith, be they Christian or of any other religious tradition, come to the business of life in ways coloured by their perceptions of God. They communicate best when they tell relevant stories full of human interest, stories about people and events which relate both to the reality of their listeners' lives and to the reality they know through their relationship with God. </p> <p>It is hard to forget the more lurid comments of breakfast show producers following contributions from well-known Christians - usually along the lines of \"God, that was so boring\" - so a few pointers might be useful. </p> <p>The Topical Thought must never bore. It must stimulate reflection: \"Hey! I've not heard that angle before\". It must reflect the gravitas of the day's news - offering a light touch, perhaps but never trivial. It must be satisfying to hear; first thing in the morning is no time for cleverness. </p> <p>It must not sound as if it is only for \"people in the know\". Christian culture uses words like \"sin\" and \"redemption\", which only have meaning within the church. Even words like \"peace\" and \"love\" are often used in ways only meaningful to insiders. The Topical Thought must seek to identify with those who might be listening, but on their terms, not on mine. </p> <p>To my mind, the early morning drive is worth the effort not because my words will suddenly transport anyone to the Damascus Road, although a process may start which could lead eventually to significant change in someone's life. It is bigger than that, and has a more far-reaching prophetic edge. </p> <p>It is worth doing because it ensures that a tiny voice is heard crying in the wilderness of the airwaves that God is still a vital companion in everyday life for countless thousands of ordinary people. </p> <p> </p> <p><b>Mark Rudall</b> is development worker for the Oxford-based Churches Media Trust</p>",
  "The lawyer Charles Rembar, who has died aged 85, won some of the most important censorship cases in America, defending the publishers of Lady Chatterley's Lover, Tropic Of Cancer and Fanny Hill. In each case, he argued that the artistic merit of the books outweighed any possible obscenity and should be protected by the first amendment of the US constitution. <p>When he set up his practice in New York, after serving in the second world war, one of his first clients was his cousin, Norman Mailer, whose novel, The Naked And The Dead (1948), had its publishers worried about earthy expletives. Rembar suggested \"fug\" was a phonetically close, but legally safe, alternative. </p> <p>Later, he became involved in a legal wrangle over another Mailer novel, The Deer Park (1955). It had been accepted for publication, and typeset, by Rinehart &amp; Co, who then decided that it was unpublishable because it was obscene. They subsequently claimed that the obscenity of the book made the contract invalid. Rembar disagreed, and was willing to test his ideas in court. Faced with a potentially costly suit, Rinehart paid Mailer his contracted advance and let the book go to GP Putnam's Sons, where it became a bestseller. </p> <p>The Lady Chatterley trials began in 1959 when Grove Press, always at the forefront of publishing contentious or avant-garde literature in America, produced an unexpurgated edition of DH Law- rence's novel, which was, at the time, banned in the US in all but a bowdlerised version. </p> <p>Copies sold via the Readers Subscription Book Club were detained by the American postal authorities (which they were, arguably, entitled to do under the 19th-century Comstock Act). After arguing their case within the post office's own judiciary system - and losing - Rembar and Grove filed a suit against Robert Christenberry, the New York city postmaster. The New York courts found in favour of Grove Press, and an appeal brought by the federal government affirmed the decision. (In England, Penguin Books followed Grove's lead and, in 1960, successfully defended Lady Chatterley's honour in one of Britain's most celebrated court cases.) </p> <p>In 1961, Grove was in even deeper trouble with Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer. Rather than defending a single summons, the publishers found themselves helping to defend more than 60 cases brought against booksellers all across the US. Although not involved in any of the local cases, Rembar successfully argued two appeals, in Massachusetts and New Jersey. A suit bought against Miller, and a conspiracy charge against Grove Press and publisher Barney Rossett, was dropped before it got to court. </p> <p>In 1965, Putnam's public- ation of John Cleland's Memoirs Of A Woman Of Pleasure, better known as Fanny Hill, saw Rembar defending the book all the way to the US supreme court. With the overturning of a temporary restraint against the book in New York, sales rocketed, but Rembar found himself on more uncertain ground when he tried to argue the literary merit of the book and its author's intent in writing it. </p> <p>On publication, in the mid-18th century, Cleland, broke and facing debtor's prison, had written the novel and sold it outright for \u00a320, which made any attempted defence that he had crafted the novel with serious literary intentions patently absurd. The eventual decision of the supreme court was six to three in the publisher's favour. </p> <p>Rembar's book on these cases, optimistically titled The End Of Obscenity (1968), was a mixture of court testimony, history and sharp, sometimes amusing, asides into the history of American law. It won the George Polk Memorial Award for the best book of 1968. The New York Times reviewer wrote that Rembar had talked the US courts into \"capsizing more than a century of court-blessed censorship.\" </p> <p>Rembar himself was no mean writer, contributing to the Atlantic Monthly, New Republic and Esquire magazines. His collection of essays, Perspective, appeared in 1975, and, five years later, came a history of the evolving American legal system, The Law Of The Land. </p> <p>In the latter, Rembar incisively explained the most complex laws, complaining that \"for centuries, our lawyers, a priestly caste, used a mysterious tongue, composed of Latin, French, English, incantation and a bit of mumbling. These continue, more or less, to the present day - Latin less, English more, French absorbed, incantation down a bit, mumbling steady\". He had a shrewd ear for a soundbite, none better than his claim that \"pornography is in the groin of the beholder\". </p> <p>The son of a hotelier, Rembar was raised in New Jersey and educated at Harvard and Columbia University law school. Before the war, he worked for the New Deal agencies and the Office of Price Administration in Washington. As well as his work in court, he also represented many leading literary figures, including Mailer, Herman Wouk, Saul Steinberg and Tom Clancy. </p> <p>Until he fell ill last July, Rembar continued to attend his New York practice every day. He is survived by his wife and two sons. </p> <p>\u0095 Charles Remar, lawyer and author, born March 12 1915; died October 24 2000.</p>",

The elderly Harry Collins remembers his youthful discovery of the mutilated body of a young black woman on the banks of the Sabine River. His father, both town barber and constable, endeavoured to solve the crime but managed only to upset the racial apple cart. Part horror mystery (with legendary local bogeyman, the Goat Man, lurking in the wings), part coming-of-age tale, this is a wonderful evocation of times and ghosts past, in the tradition of To Kill a Mockingbird.

Assisted by his sidekicks, the Village Irregulars, the Kinkster is soon on the bawdy trail and knee-deep in the customary manure. An infectious ride with smiles to spare, it's a satisfying technical knockout.

Stephanie is again lumbered with man trouble: fellow bounty hunter Ranger, on the run from a murder rap, leaves her loyalties to law and lust severely tested; then there's sexy vice cop Joe Morelli and a certain orange dog who howls when left alone.

The Irish have peopled the world, ensuring every country has its patches of green. In the process, the descendants of English colonisers have all but vanished; they may know their lineage but, if they care at all, find it largely irrelevant. They are Americans and Australians and South Africans now; there isn't any lingering affection for the old country. The same could never be said of the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Irish, who proudly proclaim their hyphenated status. They are Irish first, regardless of the generations that have passed since their ancestors set sail from Erin's green shores (and ballads with lines like that are just one example of the way in which they ensure that Ireland remains part of their continuing consciousness). </p> <p>Tim Pat Coogan's exploration of the itinerant Irish who span the globe is part history, part contemporary cultural study and part political tract. It is amusing, interesting and often absorbing, but despite its length, intelligence and wit it doesn't really answer the key questions. Why is the vast Irish diaspora still so committed to Ireland? Why have they maintained the religion and the culture? Why the maudlin sentiment about a homeland that has - for so many - never been their home? </p> <p>On Coogan's journey through Irish pubs, clubs and embassy dining halls, from Auckland to Paris to San Francisco, we meet scores of expatriate Irish who have prospered in their new lands but have never sought to cut the umbilical cord with Ireland. So powerful is its hold that even those who marry people from different backgrounds manage to impose within their \"mixed\" family a strong sense of Ireland. I recently met a distant cousin of my wife's, whose grandmother emigrated to Philadelphia in 1904. She married a man who believes his background to be Swiss. Yet their children have been raised as if they are Irish-Americans, able to recite Yeats, knowing the words to scores of Irish songs and sticking fast to the Roman Catholic faith. </p> <p>This has nothing to do with the conflict in Northern Ireland; they are not politically active. For them, as for so many of their ilk, the romantic attachment to Ireland has been part of their upbringing. Nor does it stem from ignorance. They have made many visits to the country of their ancestors and are well aware that modern Ireland is nothing like John Ford's representation in The Quiet Man (and never really was anyway). </p> <p>In my progress through Coogan's impressive range of interviewees I searched in vain for an explanation of some kind. I readily admit that this didn't spoil the journey: there is much to enjoy along the way, and it is peppered with the kind of Irish humour that can make you laugh out loud. Coogan tells of a visit to a Gaelic Athletics Association football pitch notorious for its poor facilities. Having looked in vain for somewhere to wash, he asked one of the organisers: \"Where are the showers?\" The man, pointing to some approaching black clouds, replied: \"You'll get plenty of showers when those come over.\" In Buenos Aires, where a sizeable Irish community flourishes, Coogan discovered that during the Falklands war a group of Argentinian patriots had blown up a bust of Padraig Pearse, one of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising, mistaking him for a British hero. In New Orleans, he reports, the tradition in the St Patrick's Day parade is for revellers on the floats to throw the contents of an Irish stew at spectators. </p> <p>It isn't all fun, export Guinness and uplifting rags-to-riches stories. A section on a priest savagely tortured in Argentina is but one example of the extraordinary heroism exhibited by many Irish missionaries down the years. There are also reminders of the hostility faced by Irish immigrants, especially in Britain in the 1950s, who were met by notices outside lodging houses that read \"No Irish need apply\" and often \"No Irish. No blacks. No dogs.\" Yet Coogan does not hide the other side of the coin, pointing to instances of anti-black racism by the Irish in the States, relating tales of gangsterism in south Boston and the bending of the democratic will once the Irish gained control of Tammany Hall. Sometimes the Irish fought dirty to win the recognition they now enjoy in both America and Australia. </p> <p>With the rise of the Celtic tiger and the declining birth rate, emigration has fallen away in recent years. That is good for Ireland, of course, but it means the rest of the world is bound to be a slightly poorer place without its regular green influx. Still, there are 70 million people outside Ireland laying claim to be Irish - and that's quite enough to be going on with, is it not?</p>",

Both play on the theme of doubles and madness. To this febrile pair Canongate adds Wild Nights, a family chronicle inspired by Tennant's own background, and a deft introduction from Candia McWilliam. Being Scottish may help, as McWilliam says, to understand Tennant's exploration of a divided self, but non-Scots can still relish the shifting perspectives that give her writing its peculiarity. </p> <p> <strong> Lee Trebilcock in the 20th Century</strong><br> Hannah Crow <br> (Anchor, \u00a36.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000304124,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> Set in a seaside town in the south-west of England and with an improbably named hero, Crow's debut is an impressive novel of white, working-class male anger. Lee works at Do It Easy and hopes, as any 19-year-old would, that divorc\u00e9e Lorraine from fitted kitchens will \"do it easy\" with him in the lunch break. He goes home to a council estate and a mother suffering with Alzheimers and goes around with mascara'd Hawley until Uncle Septor and his camera club decide to rid the estate of \"perverts\". Crow's portrait of adolescence is wonderfully tart, with Lee a bleakly nihilistic yet engagingly outrageous character. </p> <p> <strong> Border State</strong><br> Tonu Onnepalu <br> (Northwestern University Press, \u00a39.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000324575,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> There are 20-odd books in NUP's series of \"Writings From an Unbound Europe\" - Czech, Serbian, Hungarian and Polish writers who would otherwise rarely be read elsewhere. This small novel by the Estonian Onnepalu is written as a series of letters from an eastern European, meandering through Euro-land in the company of a lover whom he eventually murders. Elliptical and overly poetic in places, Border State nonetheless rings with fury and bewilderment at the prostitution of one half of Europe to the empty freedoms offered by the other. The metaphor is blunt, but the sentiment compelling. </p> <p> <strong> The Fish Can Sing</strong><br> Halldor Laxness<br> (Harvill, \u00a310.99)<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502144921,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> This story of an orphaned boy growing up in Reykjavik at a time when fishermen grazed horses around its outskirts describes an utterly foreign world.

This might seem to colour the narrative with folksy nostalgia, but Laxness's view of a child's bounded universe has humour and a light touch. As an antidote to psychological \"Danish novels\", he creates an engrossing alternative way of telling stories. </p>",
  "<p>Russell Banks's characters tend to be called \"trailer trash\", but it's a phrase you'll despise after reading his fiction. His new short-story retrospective, The Angel on the Roof, sinks especially deep into the ice-bound aloneness of small towns and trailer parks in upstate New Hampshire and New York, the American North Country he's staked as his own. We see the inhabitants of one lakeside terminus from a dozen angles, each enriching the pride, idiocy, selfishness, sympathy, nobility and wreckage-clinging survived despair to be found in such lost corners. </p> <p>In the novel Continental Drift (1985), the careening effort by Bob Dubois to escape his caged small-town prospects tears him away from himself and his family, and leads to devastating loss. In Rule of the Bone (1995), a teenage boy's need to out-race alienation and parental abuse spins him off America's edge. The busload of drowned, frozen schoolchildren in The Sweet Hereafter (1997) and the middle-aged man doomed by his drunk, violent father's example in Affliction (1989) - both recently adapted as Oscar-winning films - show abandonment from other angles, a genetic flaw in America's heart. Banks knows this whole story. Born in New Hampshire, he's fought off his own violent father's example, freed himself from a fated life with fiction. He knows his subjects aren't a Jerry Springer freak show. They're humanity. </p> <p>\"There's an important tradition in American writing,\" the 60-year-old says, in the upstate New York small town where he now lives, when not teaching at Princeton, \"going back to Mark Twain and forward to Raymond Carver and Grace Paley, whose work is generated by love of people who are scorned and derided. The people I'm writing about are the ones you normally don't feel affection for when you see them in the street or the shopping mall. I have an almost simple-minded affection for them. My readers are not the same as my characters, as I'm very aware. So I'm glad when they feel that affection too.\" </p> <p>Vann, in the story \"Plains of Abraham\", stands for almost all Banks's male characters: \"a complex, layered mind with only a few compartments connected\". Alienated from his culture and class, unable to understand his own nature, he has no way out. \"I think that's particularly true of men,\" Banks says. \"They feel their lives are being mysteriously controlled by forces they can't even name. As a defence they compartmentalise their experience into little boxes that don't communicate, because the truth is too painful. At some point, they hear rapping through the walls of those boxes, and they start to realise something's deeply wrong. Most of my male characters then struggle back to some place in their past, to find when the light at tunnel's end dimmed.\" </p> <p>Banks's life was like that of his own future characters until his mid-twenties, fitted to the shape set for him: wife at 18 (first of four), baby at 19, divorced at 20, a small-town New Hampshire pipe-fitter in a pick-up truck. It was writing's discipline - Jack Kerouac's harsh background and the paternal friendship of Nelson Algren were among his inspirations - that plucked him to a different life. But this uprooting left guilty scars on work that was at first constrained, in denial. \"I felt I'd betrayed my past and the people who made it up. My writing was in a netherland: fearful of my own sources, of myself, till my mid-thirties, when I accepted them.\" </p> <p>The source that was most difficult to admit was his father, a violent drunk who abandoned the family when Banks was 12, and around whom he was physically anxious even in the man's old age. \"He remains the centre of my imaginative life. He wasn't just a violent, alcoholic brute, no one is. He died in 1979, and yet he appears in my dreams two or three times a week, as he was in his mid-forties, when he was at his most powerful. He left a residue of violence my neurons are still patterned around. It's trauma that rewires them, usually. Goodness never provides a trauma. Violence does. Abandonment does. Betrayal does. My adult life has been lucky, people have been faithful and loving. So my wiring's the same.\" </p> <p>\"The Visit\", in which a successful middle-aged man revisits a childhood home electrified with shadowy, threatening memories, is also Banks's attempt to invoke what he calls the \"heat and light\" of violence, \"its erotic charge, its intensity of attention\", for both victim and victimiser - a seduction that he later sought out in senseless bar-room fights which would have left him dead if writing hadn't stepped in. Affliction's paternal tragedy was his fictional goodbye to all that. \"I was glad I wrote that story. It meant I wouldn't have to again.\" </p> <p> The Sweet Hereafter and Rule of the Bone instead focused on 1990s children: Nicole in one, Bone in the other, both sexually abused. The former's schoolbus, in which a town's children sink inexorably away from their parents through cracked ice, is later a refuge from parents for Bone, abandonment unbroken. Recently, Cloudsplitter (1999), about violent Abolitionist John Brown, investigated racism's stain. </p> <p>Banks, meanwhile, is back where he started, in a working-class small town. \"I had to will myself back. But these people are my birthright. Writing saved me by letting me leave once. But I can never go too far. All the truth I know is here.\" </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206, 501024370,00.html\">Buy The Angel on the Roof at BOL</a><br></p>",

Russia, in economic disarray, has discovered large deposits of oil and gold in Siberia. China, being cash-poor after an overspend on defence, is keen to settle a trade agreement with the US, although there are diplomatic complications. China is in dispute over US recognition of Taiwan, while its own record on human rights and enforced population control is deplored in the west. </p> <p>Meanwhile, spies monitor each other's secrets and the Americans achieve a notable coup with the penetration of a top-level Chinese secretary. Clancy's scenario is ambitious: to show how the various facets of industry, trade, the military, espionage and government work in foreign affairs, and what happens when the diplomatic process breaks down and military aggression takes over. When John Chinaman - as Clancy so quaintly calls him - finds himself cornered by circumstance, he decides to plunder Siberia for its newly discovered raw materials, which leads to a ground war and the threat of a Chinese nuclear strike. </p> <p>This synopsis is offered merely as proof that the book has been read. Clancy - a terrible old windbag - takes more than 1,000 pages to tell a story that should have taken half that; given his top-selling status, he has clearly progressed beyond any kind of editing. With its blockbuster cast, wodges of undigested research and useless insider information, endless acronyms and countless dreary minor anecdotes, the book is clunkily authentic and insistent on leaving nothing to the imagination. Clancy comes into his own as a techno-bore, but in spite of all the hardware authenticity - and plausibility of the central scenario - as an objective political analyst, he is in the world of Boys' Own. The general tone is one of old-fashioned colonial propaganda: devious Oriental control freaks versus the responsible statesmanship and reasoned informality of US government (the president calls his wife \"Babe\"; the head of the CIA calls her husband \"Honeybunny\"). Clancy's president is an anodyne Kennedy retread, minus infidelities, while the Russians - now that we know them better - turn out to be soulful, reliable and, well, not wily. \"He was a Russian patriot,\" we are solemnly informed in tourist-brochure prose, \"who loved the very smell of Russian soil, the birch forests, the vodka and the borscht.\" </p> <p>The writing - never any great shakes to start with and at best done in a style that could be called runaway word processor - is by now on full autopilot, and readers who haven't already quit from exhaustion might get the sneaking suspicion that the author too has long jumped ship. From here on few sentences stand up to inspection, particularly those relating to routine and time (most of the book): \"The morning sun that lit up Beijing had done the same to Siberia even earlier in the day.\" </p> <p> The Bear and the Dragon lends new evidence to the theory that Clancy is in reality a CIA committee designed to produce US propaganda in the form of popular entertainment. In its bulk and lack of conspicuous authorship, the work is clearly beyond the scope of a single writer, just as it is equally obvious that the jacket photo of \"Tom Clancy\" is in fact Big Ron Atkinson moonlighting as an author double. </p> <p>After Clancy, Andy McNab is a breeze: Blue Peter for big boys - \"Here's a bomb I made earlier\". McNab is on-the-ground, hands-on and presenter-led with a hero who can manage a bit of fieldcraft, is professionally efficient and privately a mess; prone to dodgy women and sentimental about children. Like Clancy, McNab is a secure franchise, an authentic storyteller on the grounds of his been-there, done-that experiences in the SAS, thanks to which he is able to dispose of the notion of writing as a poncy business. His language favours the vernacular, and any evidence of interior life is rendered only in terms of the accepted visceral response, as in \"gutted\". </p> <p>McNab's plots, which are efficient and uncomplicated, could be primly summarised as: the best-laid plans go awry, so get out of that. Yet, for all his reliance on formula, he never emerges as a cynical writer and with this novel shows signs of studying the craft. Firewall is essentially an update of Len Deighton's Billion Dollar Brain , down to its Scandinavian locations and computer plot - a debt belatedly admitted when McNab writes \"I felt like Harry Palmer in one of those Michael Caine films from the 60s\" - and it succeeds in capturing something of early Deighton's insolent, other-ranks tone.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Hill Bachelors</strong> <br> William Trevor <br> 256pp, Viking<br> \u00a315.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000240122,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> In his complete control of the short-story form, William Trevor follows in the tradition of Chekhov, but his material often swerves towards Dostoevskian lower depths: murder, paedophilia and terrorism, as well as the strands that bind families and friends, are the stuff of this collection. Each story reveals lives cut open with the precision of a surgeon's scalpel, every scene is probed with the thrill of a torch through a keyhole. Roving between Ireland, England and France, the author writes from the minds of his characters, understanding the kind of reticence that damages as often as it heals. In their fear of speaking up, nobody is completely innocent. Whether they are young or old, clever or stupid, the silence between individuals echoes with words they are unable to utter, as well as an abiding sense of guilt at their failure to do so. </p> <p>Yet there is hope in that silence. Trevor's characters are not the victims of the classic Irish short story. They are saved by a perception that even if they fail, something good may emerge from the mess they have made. In \"Death of a Professor\", the wife of an ageing Oxford don is unable to break the news that his obituary has been mischievously published in the morning papers. Her attempt to shield him from the hoax leads to further humiliation among his colleagues. Forgiven, she realises she cannot even tell her husband that she loves him for his wisdom: \"Not brains, they all had brains. Not skill. Not knowing everything, for they knew less than they imagined. His wisdom is almost indefinable, what a roadworker might have, a cinema usher or a clergyman or a child.\" </p> <p>In another story, a child actor hopes that her part in a film will bring her estranged parents together again. She is playing a paedophile's victim, the ramifications of which are never explained to her. Told \"we're into compassion here\", she must act in such a way that the audience \"will feel the pity thing\" for her molester. She becomes increasingly frightened of the man playing the role, and when drama becomes reality keeping quiet seems the only way to go on. Another secret condemns a young Irish labourer in London to a lifetime of silence. The confusion of loneliness and a patchy camaraderie of strangers have drawn him into involvement with the IRA; when he finally confronts the implications of what he is doing, he knows his moment of courage can never be shared. </p> <p>Some of Trevor's characters do not recognise the difference their decisions can make. In \"Of the Cloth\", an aged Donegal rector attends the funeral of his gardener in the local Catholic church. He is impressed by the apparent confidence of the congregation, comparing it to his own disappearing religion, whose designation, Church of Ireland, \"had long ago seemed too imposing a title, ludicrous almost in its claim\". That night, when he is visited by the young priest, they find common ground in a shared love for their country and the sense of change that is affecting both their lives. The priest had come to thank the rector for his protection of a parishioner, \"and by saying it had found a solace for himself. Small gestures mattered now, and statements in the dark were a way to keep the faith, as the monks had kept it in an Ireland that was different too.\" </p> <p>Only the story of a medieval monk's road to Damascus fails to convince. Trevor has respect for his subject, but seems unable to empathise with so much blind faith. Personal insights offer more comfort. In \"Against the Odds\", a Belfast con woman arrives in a small country town just as the Northern Irish peace process is beginning. When she selects a tragically widowed turkey farmer as her next soft target, she \"felt as she often felt when she got to this stage in a bit of business - that some shadow of herself was having its way with her\". In another story, a middle-aged couple decide to leave London for the country. They are upset when a bachelor friend appears to imagine that he might move in with them. The idea is farcical, but the wife finds herself pleading his case, admitting that this hopeless misfit harbours an attraction to her and that \"you can pity a child ... no matter what a child is like\". </p> <p>In Trevor's world, even self-delusion can be tinged with a miraculous shaft of grace. His universe is illuminated by an imagination that is rich and various, while the structure of each piece draws you into the next like a fugue. And this modern master is never more Chekhovian than in the way that rereading promises subtleties still not guessed and patterns that will emerge when the first frisson of satisfaction is over.</p>",
  "<p>For Roger Scruton, as for so many of his generation, the Paris riots of May 1968 were the defining political moment of his life. He was in the Latin Quarter when students tore up the cobblestones to hurl at the riot police. His friends overturned cars and uprooted lamp-posts to erect the barricades. Representatives of his own discipline, old philosophers like Marx and new ones like Foucault, were providing the intellectual fuel for the fire raging on the ground. </p> <p> As he watched the events unfold from his apartment window, and listened to his friends, drunk on revolutionary hope and excitement, Scruton found his own emotions and opinions crystallising. \"I suddenly realised that I was on the other side,\" he says. \"What I saw was an unruly mob of self-indulgent middle-class hooligans. When I asked my friends what they wanted, what were they trying to achieve, all I got back was this ludicrous Marxist gobbledegook. I was disgusted by it, and thought there must be a way back to the defence of western civilisation against these things. That's when I became a conservative. I knew I wanted to conserve things rather than pull them down.\" </p> <p> His efforts to do this over the next three decades have made him one of the most contentious figures in British public life. As an academic, journalist and writer he has been a lightning rod for criticism and abuse from the left. While he has a reputation as a first class professional philosopher among other academics of all political persuasions, he has regularly been shouted down in universities and prevented from speaking. </p> <p> His books have been unmercifully slaughtered by reviewers and his pronouncements on society mocked. He is accused of being a grammar-school boy in thrall to the upper classes: \"it is all a bit like Charles Ryder in Brideshead\", says one observer. The fact that he used to go fox-hunting wearing Enoch Powell's old hunting clothes - the jacket split the first time he used it - says it all for many others. \"I do ask myself why I make people so enraged, because I only ever say what I think. And while I know it might not be everyone's point of view, that doesn't seem particularly intolerable to me.\" </p> <p> Part of the reason is, of course, straightforward political disagreement. As an academic in the 1980s, for instance, he did not make himself popular among his peers by defending education cuts. But this doesn't explain the venomous intensity of the attacks. For this, one must look at his interventions in social and cultural issues, where gut reactions can count for more than the sophistication of the argument. One such issue is national identity, which has increasingly entered the cultural and intellectual mainstream. Britishness has become a legitimate subject for discussion with two recent debates - one trivial, one less so - flickering across the public consciousness; the Runnymede Trust report on the future of multi-ethnic Britain, and whether the England football team should have a foreign coach. </p> <p> It wasn't always this way. The incendiary combination of nationality, race, history and culture was until recently something most sensible commentators avoided. But not Scruton. In 1982, as editor of the conservative philosophical journal The Salisbury Review, he published an article called Education And Race by Ray Honeyford, a Bradford headmaster. The gist was that multi-cultural education was actually harmful for immigrant children. </p> <p> \"All hell broke loose,\" recalls Scruton. \"But Ray Honeyford is not racist. He spent his whole life teaching Pakistani children in Bradford, trying to do the best for them against their parents and the mullahs. He recognised the terrible conflicts. But then, in the 80s, any questioning of the left-liberal orthodoxy could only have a racist motivation, or be seen to give succour to racists. I'd argue that not addressing these issues gives succour to racists. But it got us into terrible trouble.\" </p> <p> His latest book, England: An Elegy tries to show England as reflected in its own ideals, he says. \"I know ideals aren't realities, but they do influence reality - social, legal, political, cultural.\" Its reception shows the change in mood. Of course he gets his share of sneering reviews but there is a recognition of his breadth of reference and scholarship and he wins less grudging support from some surprising quarters. </p> <p> Labour Peer Melvyn Bragg describes it as \"an elegant and moving book\", before claiming Scruton \"is excellent at bringing common sense to bear on the distressing frenzy which has overtaken those whose views of England can only be doom-struck and void of all praise.\" Anthony Barnett, the founding director of Charter 88, who also has written on Englishness from a radical perspective, has worked with Scruton. Together they set up the Town and Country Forum to bring a non-partisan approach to discussion of urban and rural conflicts. He praises Scruton's willingness to engage. </p> <p>\"People who take these things seriously are trying not to think in received political terms any more,\" Barnett says. \"Agri-business, medical ethics, environmental questions can't just be thought about in terms of right and left. Even on a red-flag issue like hunting there is no simple left position.\" Scruton himself, for instance, is in favour of higher fuel taxes although he is not surprised that their implementation was so contentious. </p> <p> But for all this apparent reasonableness, he still puts himself out there to be shot at. Shortly after he first became a father, two years ago, at 54, he wrote a tongue-in-cheek article about childrearing. \"It goes without saying that Sam will not enjoy his childhood\", he said before going on to anticipate their \"nightly readings of the classics and our home performances of Shakespeare,\" and the young Sam, like John Stuart Mill, would be reading Greek by the age of six. The Guardian Diary responded by launching the Samuel Scruton Playstation appeal, but he was duly castigated and mocked elsewhere for his antediluvianism. </p> <p> Again, this hasn't stopped him writing about his own experiences, and his last two books have contained significant autobiographical content. The opening lines of his historical and social celebration, On Hunting, said his life divides into three parts. \"In the first, I was wretched; in the second, ill at ease; in the third, hunting.\" In England: An Elegy, his starting point is himself. \"TS Eliot said writing autobiography was, 'imposing order on and eliciting order in, one's life'. It did bring order to my life which I needed.\" </p> <p> Scruton was born in 1944. His father was a left-wing working-class Mancunian who became a teacher. Jack Scruton hated the upper class and loved the English countryside. Scruton's mother, Beryl Claris - always called Johnny - was a more genteel figure who read romantic fiction and, \"entertained blue-rinsed ladies who appeared miraculously almost as soon as he [father] was out the door.\" </p> <p> Roger and his two sisters were brought up in Buckinghamshire, in Marlow and High Wycombe, and he remembers, \"a sort of Lawrentian class-tension between my parents. There were terrible rows which frightened the children. My father went through a very depressed period - partly through not getting anywhere with his career but also something deeper - about the time I was entering puberty. Life at home wasn't very good and I had really left by the time I was 16 and didn't go back until after Cambridge when I went to look after my mother when she was dying.\" </p> <p>In both On Hunting and England: An Elegy, Scruton continually nags at his father's viewpoint and arguments. \"My father was a man of principle,\" he says, \"who found his principles confirmed in the unremitting failure which they brought on him. But my personality was significantly shaped by him. He represented to me a personality that was quintessentially English in the determination to be himself and entertain his own cantankerous views. But he also represents a view of the world against which I found myself at an early age in rebellion.\" </p> <p> In fact Scruton was on the left at school, High Wycombe Grammar. But even then he didn't go along with \"all the fashionable causes of the day\", and was shocked when a friend was imprisoned after an Aldermaston march. Scruton has little but praise for the school, which the headmaster self-consciously modelled on Eton. Many of the staff had been in the war and in the colonial service; the children were clever and keen; but Scruton says he wasn't the brightest boy. \"There was one who could play all the Beethoven sonatas. When he was 14 he introduced me to Oswald Spengler's Decline Of The West. But many grammar schools were like that then. There was a ferment of intellectual activity as we explored the post-war world.\" </p> <p> For all this, he says he refused to fit in. He shunned the cadets and sports, played bass guitar when he was 16, and was into the Beatles. He was eventually expelled, although only after he had won a scholarship to Cambridge. \"The headmaster had wanted to throw me out for a while but he recognised that I was good for the statistics. We put on this play and he came and saw the stage on fire with a half-naked girl on it. His solution was to expel me.\" </p> <p> In his gap year - as it then wasn't called - Scruton washed-up in a Lyons corner house on the Mile End Road, east London, hitchhiked to Greece and then to Egypt before getting a boat to Lebanon, where he ran out of money. He couldn't work his passage home on British boats because he wasn't in the union - \"my first experience of the trade unions which my father admired\" - so ended up on a Norwegian vessel carrying potatoes. </p> <p> When he got to Cambridge, in 1962, his adventures made him feel much older than his contemporaries, and he changed courses on the first day, from natural sciences to philosophy. He says he was not political. \"But this was pre-1968. There was an old idea of education that prevailed. I went to lectures on Kant and Hume and logic and literature and I couldn't tell you what my lecturers' political beliefs were.\" </p> <p> In his new book he claims that England died about the time he was at university. From his father he got a pessimism about the fate of rural England and had a melancholy sense that western civilisation was doomed. \"But like anyone who was brought up on Leavis, I had a tremendous belief in English culture and literature. I never though there was an alternative to what we had inherited. You either learn to inherit it properly or you become disinherited. I always thought the oriental faction - the hashish-smoking people with pony tails and dreamy eyes - were escapists. They hadn't found an alternative but were just deceiving themselves.\" </p> <p> Although destined for an academic career, a life at Cambridge didn't appeal. \"It was then quasi-monastic. There weren't many women around, there was this mist of nostalgic pederasty that hung over it all.\" He had ambitions to be a writer but took a job at the University of Bordeaux where he rented a cottage in the foothills of the Pyrennees. He then moved to Rome, where he wrote a novel that was never published, and returned in 1969 to Peterhouse, Cambridge, as a research fellow in aesthetics. </p> <p> Two years later he moved to Birkbeck College, London. He was made professor of aesthetics in 1985 and stayed at the college until 1992. \"When I went to Birkbeck I was already in a conservative frame of mind,\" he says. \"My colleagues regarded me with great suspicion. The waves of 1968 had just reached London University. There were attempts to introduce more Foucault and Marx on to the curriculum. I had been brought up in Cambridge with this completely de-politicised view of what philosophy should be, so was obviously against all this.\" </p> <p> While at Birkbeck he read for the Bar as a fall-back position. \"I thought I might have to get out of this, and the law seemed a career where conservatives might be welcomed. I thought I ought to have an exit route.\" AC Grayling was a colleague in the Birkbeck philosophy department and says Scruton is a very good professional academic philosopher \"and a wonderful teacher of philosophy. The pedagogic works he wrote for students and the general public are clear, lucid and accurate. It is partly because of Roger's presence that the department is one of the best in the country.\" Grayling, who says he and Scruton disagree politically, also says what a \"very charming and somewhat sweet man,\" he is in person. \"This rather glum, obtuse figure who pops up every now again to say 'bring back hanging', or something, is not really characteristic of him.\" </p> <p> Ralph Walker of Magdalen College, Oxford, agrees about Scruton's academic stature, but claims that what he tries to do, at least part of the time, is to stimulate people. \"Some of the views he expresses in conversation or print are not necessarily views he would hold to the bitter end. They are often put in a provocative form for people to think about. Roger irritates people who find they don't like the position he's taken, but can't argue back. That can show itself as anger or accusations of extremism.\" </p> <p> This was Scruton's \"ill at ease\" period, made harder by a failed marriage. He had met Danielle Laffitte, a student, in France. After a long on-off affair they married in 1973, but were divorced in 1979. She still lives in England and they meet occasionally. \"It wasn't a very happy experience. I think marriages are much less stable if you live together first,\" he says. \"You don't have that sense of the metaphysical transformation from one condition to the next. The rite of passage is lost.\" </p> <p> He and Danielle didn't have children because there was, \"not sufficient commitment. Also there was selfishness. Perhaps if we had [children] we would have stayed together.\" Scruton did not become a father until two years ago when he and his second wife, Sophie Jeffreys, had Samuel. A second child, Lucy, was born last August. Jeffreys, an architectural historian, is 28 years his junior. They live contentedly on a farm in Wiltshire. Scruton also has a two-room apartment in Albany, the exclusive lodgings on London's Piccadilly. His rooms used to be the late MP Alan Clark's servant quarters.</p> <p> As Birkbeck only operated in the evenings, it gave Scruton time to pursue a career as a writer cum journalist as well as moving into the world of politics. He says he was appalled by the Heath government. \"There seemed to be a lot of thinking to be done and no-one was doing it.\" Along with the MP Hugh Fraser, Jonathan Aitken and academic John Casey, Scruton founded the Conservative Philosophy Group. Antonia Fraser, then married to Hugh Fraser, the Tory MP, and herself on the left, has been a friend since that time. Through her, Scruton got to know her present husband, Harold Pinter; this proved useful when Scruton was in financial difficulties. </p> <p> \"Wine has been the most important factor in my life, apart from women and song, but it can be an expensive taste. When I was a don at Cambridge I could buy it at cost and I bought a lot of 1961 clarets. But I fell on hard times and couldn't pay my tax bill so I sold the lot to Harold Pinter. He was the only person who would trust me that these bottles really were what I told him they were, because all the labels had come off. He was just marrying Antonia and wanted a proper cellar. He was very generous and did invite me to drink some of it afterwards.\" Scruton is often associated with Margaret Thatcher's reinvigoration of the Conservative party through a red-blooded commitment to the market in the mid 1970s. But he says that process happened quite independently of anything he was doing. \"Thatcher was completely indifferent to our kind of conservative philosophy. I'd never heard of her gurus - people like Alan Walters and Alfred Sherman.\" </p> <p> Scruton was associated with writers at the Spectator and Telegraph, exponents of a more settled, patrician conservatism. \"It was about a subdued sense of the importance of history and tradition, of doing things in an orderly way. Small-scale improvements. The market economy was a good thing but it wasn't the foundation of social order, and should be heavily qualified by all the traditions that enable people to live with each other rather than just compete. But under Thatcher it was completely the free market.\" </p> <p> His association with Thatcher didn't do him any good. \"I was identified in the intellectual world with this terrible woman - who I never knew, although I do now - and was blamed for everything she did, without me knowing what she would do.\" He did attempt to get on the Tory candidates' list in 1978 but was turned down - \"too bookish\". Soon after, he began a crash course in very practical politics. In 1979 he was invited to an aesthetics conference in Krakow, Poland. It was just after the election of a Polish Pope and just before the birth of Solidarity. \"Culpably, I had never engaged with communism,\" he says. </p> <p>\"When the Prague Spring happened in 1968, I so identified it with the ghastly students I'd seen in Paris I didn't have much sympathy, which I now realise was a terrible wrong. It showed a lack of moral imagination on my part and unfortunately I never acted upon it.\" </p> <p> His visit to Poland disturbed him. He then went on to Prague to give a secret lecture with the dissident Czech philosopher Julius Tomin. After the lecture he accompanied Tomin back to his apartment. Waiting for them at the entrance was a secret policeman who refused to let Scruton in and then threw him down the stairs. From then on Scruton was a marked man. He was eventually arrested when two policeman stepped out from behind a bush in Brno and soon after he was thrown out of the country.</p> <p> \"I realised that this was a situation that was complete outside anything in my experience,\" he says \"And at the same time this was a place which was dear to my heart. The intellectual life was genuinely dangerous. They were being put in jail by a left-wing police force.\"</p> <p>Along with other British academics, mostly from Oxford, he began to work with the Jan Hus educational trust - named after the 13th century Czech reformer and martyr - to provide books, support samizdat production and teach courses. The foreign office had been lukewarm about their activities until Malcolm Rifkind became minister of state with responsibility for eastern Europe in 1982. \"The foreign office's job was to maintain links with government,\" explains Rifkind, \"but I thought we could have links with unofficial bodies as well and should make contact with dissidents.\" He lent support to Scruton and others and commends their bravery. \"Travelling as an individual in quite hostile terrain, they were putting themselves at risk.\"</p> <p> Scruton learned Czech and threw himself in to the culture. Pavel Bratinka, a nuclear physicist in Prague who, because of his opposition to the regime, was forced to work as cleaner on the metro, attended Scruton's seminars. After communism collapsed he held several ministerial posts in the new government. \"As a thinker whose point of departure was conservative he was very important here,\" explains Bratinka. \"His reputation in academic circles is very high. They know that what he did was for no personal reward and we are extremely grateful to him. I hope after he dies they name a street for him here in Prague.\" </p> <p> After communism collapsed, to Bratinka's huge surprise, the alumni of his classes were suddenly in charge. Scruton formed a consultancy firm to make contacts between western businesses and the new governments. However, his friends' power was short-lived, and he is depressed that the communists hadn't gone away after all. \"They worked out that they would do far better if they gave up the nonsense of political power and just seized the assets of the country instead. They privatised the whole economy to themselves.\" </p> <p>He says he had no hope that communism would go away. \"I thought that perhaps we were keeping the light of learning burning just a little longer than it would have otherwise. But it was the right thing to do, and you do get comfort from doing something that is morally right. As there was no way this could be publicly known, that was the only motive for doing it. It was hugely important to me.\" Scruton was subsequently awarded the Czech republic's highest civilian honour for his work. </p> <p> During the 1980s he was having a very hard time. He says his columns in the Times and editorship of the Salisbury Review had identified him as an intellectual traitor, a rightwinger and a person of ill-repute. He then tried writing a novel, Francesca, about a grammar-school boy who falls for an upper-class girl, which reviewers rushed to annihilate. \"It felt unjust,\" he says. \"I don't mind people criticising me. I'm bound to be criticised because I say strong things that are controversial, although I do try to back them up. But that is not the same as being mocked and made to look ridiculous by people who don't understand what you are saying.\" </p> <p> So shaken was Scruton by the reviews of Francesca that he stopped writing fiction. Instead he turned his creative energies to music. He is a very good pianist and, perhaps surprisingly, has a keen appreciation of 20th century music. He wrote an opera, The Minister, about a politician who sacrifices his personal life to ambition. It was staged in the Czech republic and in Oxford. </p> <p> His other response to the relentless criticism in this country was to accept the post of professor of philosophy at Boston University in the US. While he says that many of the students weren't very good, \"those that were good were fantastic. Especially those from the bible belt, who were a gift to someone like me. They had that residue of European culture which most young people in England no longer have. American culture can be what you want: you can make around yourself a circle of people that are your type.\" This is more difficult to do in England. He claims English culture has become mediocratised in the last 10 years: the legitimisation of pop music and football as genuine manifestations of the nations culture being prime examples. </p> <p> His next novel, Xanthippic Dialogues, written in dialogue form about Plato's women, was better received, and encouraged Scruton to return home full-time. \"I'd found an idiom that synthesised my philosophical side and my fiction side. I always think that a world view is incomplete if it can't be embodied in some way in the human situation. This makes Shakespeare into a truly great philosopher.</p> <p> You can explore his characters and come across metaphysical layers and an archaeology of knowledge in each of them. I don't have the talent, but I would like to be a really serious philosopher who absolutely concretised his philosophy in individual characters in a situation that makes them live.\" </p> <p> A C Grayling says that \"the intellectual class and the academic class only fractionally overlap these days. Most academics are great experts in their field, but that's no guarantee they will be widely read and cultured individuals. Roger certainly is. He could see the wider picture and had an appreciation of the wider civilisation to go along with his academic and professional knowledge.\" </p> <p> Scruton says he regrets as a young man \"dithering\" as to what type of intellectual he should be. \"I knew since I had been in France that I was an intellectual in the French mould. I should be sitting in a cafe rather than a lecture room. But I was brought up on analytical philosophy. It isn't people showing off and trying to be incomprehensible and deep, but addressing real problems. It gets technical and dry and seems detached from ordinary human life and from culture and the spiritual - all the things you go to philosophy for as an amateur in the first place. </p> <p> \"Even though I knew it was a means, not an end, I should have been much more clear at the beginning that I would try to internalise that discipline but nevertheless be true to my cultural identity - somebody attempting to express a vision of human life rather than attacking tiny little problems within it. That's been hard but I think it has come together much more now.\" </p> <p> There is still a way to go before he can expect people to disentangle the personality of the man from his work. He says he was astonished by the reaction to his jokey piece on child-rearing. \"There was such a complete lack of a sense of humour in the people who responded to it. It was tongue-in-cheek. But of course irony can be difficult. That's why Socrates was put to death in Athens. His irony was not only a form of truth-telling but it made people inferior because they were. He brought them face to face with their own inferiority. No wonder they put him to death.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Roger Vernon Scruton </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> February 27 1944. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> High Wycombe Grammar School; Jesus College, Cambridge. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1973 Danielle Laffitte, divorced 1979; 1996 Sophie Jeffreys (one son, one daughter). </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> Research fellow, Peterhouse, Cambridge 1969-71; Birkbeck College, lecturer in philosophy 1971-79, reader 1979-85, professor of aesthetics 1985-92; professor of philosophy Boston University 1992-95.

  "<p>\"When you see the Nobel Peace Prize pinned on the chest of a man whose maps still do not depict the state of Israel, then you know there is nothing you can do. The hyena never changes his spots.\" I say, this is crazy. Where is the hope? Where is the way forward? \"The only hope now,\" - he sips his coffee - \"is the passage of time. Arafat can never be the solution, because he will always be the problem. For as long as my Arab neighbours go on choosing him, there is no hope whatsoever.</p> <p>\"People know this. They know it but they don't want to face it. They go round saying \"Oh wouldn't it be nice if it all worked out somehow? They know the facts but they refuse to draw the conclusion. It won't work out.\"</p> <p>We are all taken aback by Begin, his intellectual command, his profound and daunting pessimism, and Sigal has gone into one of her silent moods, as if the effort of listening without interrupting has terminally lowered her spirits. I scarcely have time to worry about this. For today I have decided to walk through the mirror into Israel's twin, its underside.</p> <p> Nothing prepares you for the physical shock of the passage into Gaza. One writer has said that driving from Israel into the Gaza Strip is like driving from California into Bangladesh. You become so used to the broad highways, the easy sensuality of Israel that it is the sight of dust, sudden dust, an unholy big brown storm of pure dirt, which alerts you to the fact that you are about to enter a society where people earn precisely 8% of what their opposite numbers earn in Israel.</p> <p>Keith Lawrence and I set off on foot across the concrete strip which divides the two countries. For a moment, it is like a John Le Carre movie, as we carry our bags past gun towers down the wide empty road. And at the exact half-way point, just as in the movies, I am seized, bundled into a waiting car and driven quickly away, admittedly by two friendly young Englishwomen. The reason for this haste, it turns out, is that Susannah and Pauline, my new British Council handlers, have just told me that in 20 minutes I will be meeting with Haider Abdel Shafi. Shafi is the most popular politician in Gaza and it is something of a mystery why he has agreed to see me, since he sees no one. </p> <p>As we travel along a potholed track - you couldn't call it a road - towards the city of Gaza, I am taken aback by what I am seeing. Gaza is an area 45 kilometres by eight. Even now, one-third of it is held by the Israelis, on behalf of just 6,000 religious settlers. Around them are crammed 750,000 Palestinians, half of whom live in the refugee camps, which were temporarily established in 1948.</p> <p>Dusk comes down and we have stepped back 60 years. As we push past the donkeys Pauline says: \"It's a good day today because it's not been raining. When it rains, there's no drainage and the main street can be under three feet of water. Turds float past the car window,\" she says. There are rudiments of civilisation - yellow dustbins, donated by the European Union ; donkeys queue at the 18 sets of traffic lights, donated by the French; and in a bizarre job creation scheme there are innumerable young boys dressed as policemen, and universally ignored. </p> <p>As soon as we are ushered into Haider Abdel Shafi's elegant living room, it becomes clear why he has agreed to meet me. He believes that I am the Guardian journalist, David Hirst, and, as such, the author of a recent two-page expose straplined \"Shameless in Gaza\". Since the 70-year-old Shafi has lately resigned from the legislative body in protest at the notorious corruption of Arafat's regime, he is keen to congratulate me on my work. It seems somehow appropriate to this peculiar, hushed city that a man who knows nothing is now about to interview a man who thinks he is someone else.</p> <p>\"If I want to find excuses for Arafat, then I suppose I can say he has spent his whole life in a liberation movement, and he is unused to not getting his way. Hundreds of millions of dollars have simply disappeared. Arafat is a man who buys peoples' allegiance. But in a society where law is neglected and never enforced, nothing can ever be right.\"</p> <p>I ask what effect the lawlessness is having on the peace process. Shafi smiles. \"There is no peace process. Even by pretending that there is such a thing, we play into Israeli hands. I was in Washington for 20 months negotiating, so I know how Israelis think. Their position has never changed. All they are doing is using settlements to establish their presence in the land, and then to treat it as a fait accompli. It's a strategy, nothing more.\" </p> <p>Shafi gets up to offer us Turkish coffee and chocolates from a big tin of Milk Tray. He twinkles at the ladies, who glow back from the sofa. \"President Clinton has no interest in the indigenous people of Palestine, who were here long before the Israelis arrived. He wants settlement-building to stop. But for him it's not a matter of principle. It's a tactic in his peace process. It's a pause he wants, not a stop.\" How does Arafat feel? \"I have no idea. He refuses to reveal his thinking. Friends say he is depressed. I cannot wonder he is depressed.</p> <p>\"Our most urgent task is to reform ourselves. It's far more important than negotiation with Israel. You can't get anywhere if you live in a society without principles. When Mohammed came back from battle, he said: \"Raja na min al jihadil-asgar ila l-jihadi l-akbar. We come back from the little strife and we return to the bigger strife. The strife of the soul.' But of course nowadays, nobody thinks about these things.\"</p> <p>It is Shafi's achievement to create a calm in us all, and the calm lasts as we step out onto the empty street. I ask: \"Where does Arafat live?\" It's dark and not a soul moves. We drive towards the sea. We turn. A quiet avenue of villas. At the end of this road of seaside vernacular, two enormous tanks. Behind them, Arafat's house, looking like any other.</p> <p>We get out. Silence. Only the roar of the surf, the Mediterranean. \"There'll be a civil war,\" says Pauline. \"It's inevitable. The society is simply not functioning.\"</p> <p>Later, it is Pauline who finally sets me straight. She is here to help the Palestinians set up a civil service. \"What you're seeing, I'm afraid, is the result of the intifada. You have to understand that was a real revolution, and it came up from below, not from the leadership. But now . . . well it's like that film with Meryl Streep. What's it called?\" \"You mean the one where she's meant to be Danish?\" \"No, not that one. The one set during the war.\" \"Oh, Plenty,\" I say, \"I wrote it.\" She looks at me suspiciously. \"Well anyway, the figure of the woman - what's she called?\" \"Susan Traherne.\" \"Yes, the woman who goes to war at 20 and for whom the peace is this terrible disappointment. It's the same here. It's like Plenty. These kids were 13 or 14, some of them even seven or eight, and they found they could create their own structures. They could have a direct and devastating effect on daily life in Israel. By their actions they truly achieved something. But now the energy is gone. The men from Tunis came and stole it. Those same kids have grown up and are sitting around in cafes. They have no jobs, they have no life, they're totally disillusioned. </p> <p>\"There was a point once, there was a reason. You were fighting for a Palestinian state, and you were willing to die. What on earth would you die for now? If you struggled now, you would be arrested, and tortured and put to death, all so that Arafat can go on being corrupt. There are more people in prison today under Arafat than there were under the Israelis! What's the point of dying for a society without rules? If the Israelis were really clever, they would give the Palestinians every inch of land they want, and then stand by and watch them fuck it up.\" This is a terrible analysis, but it's confirmed when I next travel, this time to the Arab city of Ramallah. My official companion is Muna Khlefi, a sparkling, clever Palestinian who thinks I am incredibly lucky to have met Haider Abdel Shafi and who wants to hear every word. \"He is a great man. He is the guts, he is the soul of the country. The new leadership just want to do business. They did business in Lebanon, they did it in Tunis. They say: just make money, then later we'll decide what kind of society we want. But Shafi says you cannot delay this question.\" Muna wants me to meet Albert Aghazerin, the great Palestinian historian, to talk about the problem of Jerusalem. He is late, so I sit in his outer office at Birzeit University, looking out onto the hillside campus. I pick up the Amnesty International report on Palestine. \"Subjects have been electrocuted, hanged upside down. Scalding plastic has been melted over their bodies... \"</p> <p>After an hour, Aghazerin arrives, a frightening figure with a big pipe and a superb sculpted face, rather like the actor Anthony Quinn. He thrusts an article at me, ordering me to read it. When I dare to ask a question, he sighs and says: \"Where do you start? For me you can only answer this by considering the Egyptian conquest of 1831,\" and at once he sets off on a canter through 19th-century statistics which I can't grasp, partly because he scares me so much, and partly because his mind is leaping about like an angry gazelle. </p> <p>However, when I ask him what he thinks the religious Jew truly believes, he starts to cheer up, pleased that we turn out to share a common interest. \"All this apocalyptic stuff only starts after 1967. You do get a whiff of it before but it's only after the six day war that the Jews come up with this new interpretation of the Bible. The building of the Third Temple! The end of the world! Please! It's pure opportunism. Religious revelation which just happens to be the most perfect political connivance.</p> <p>\"There are women in Jerusalem who've actually started sewing the garments for the priests of the Third Temple and they're preparing the unblemished... ANIMAL. You know, what is it? That... what is it? Animal, begins with h? H!\", he shouts. \"Heifer?\" \"That's right! HEIFER! They are preparing the unblemished HEIFER to purge the temple. And of course it all suits Israel fine. But groups like this always bring violence and bloodshed. Rabin's assassination did not come out of nothing.\"</p> <p>I ask him if he thinks Israel divided. \"Deeply, deeply divided. There are three Israels now. The hedonistic Israel of Tel-Aviv. The austere Israel of Jerusalem. And the mad Israel of Hebron which wants only vengeance and blood.</p> <p>\"Look I do not discount what the Jews suffered. Nobody can. I know what they suffered in Europe. But to me it is as if they jumped from a burning building and happened to land and break the neck of a man who was passing. And when the man says 'Hey, you've broken my neck', they say 'Sorry, it's because of the fire'. And when the man says \"yes, but my neck's broken', they just break his arm to try and shut him up. And when he doesn't shut up, they break his other arm. Then his leg. Then his other leg. All in the hope that one day he'll shut up. But, you see, I don't think he will.</p> <p>\"I like these parables. I will give you another. Israel has its hands round our throat. He can't throttle us, but nor can he let us go. He's unhappy because he wants to go for a beer, and we're unhappy because we're being strangled, but in some terrible way we are bound up in each other's unhappiness. We cannot be separated.\"</p> <p>I ask him if it will change. \"It will stink before it changes. You have to ask yourself about the so-called peace process: is its purpose the exchange of land, or is it the subjugation of the Palestinian people? Because, on the ground, there's no question all the evidence points to the second. What is the reason for all these stupid checkpoints, and the impossibility of Arabs getting a visa to visit Jerusalem? Arabs can't visit Jerusalem!\" </p> <p>On the road home to Jerusalem the other night he was stopped, as he always is, at the checkpoint. The army girl who was no older than his own daughter started to go through all his luggage. When she put his things back he said: \"Do you like what you do? I have a daughter, and I will give her the right to do many things, but not this, because this is dehumanising. Do you know what she replied? 'I'm doing a job. I don't think about it. Now goodbye.' </p> <p>\"Shall I sum it up for you? They always ask two questions. Did you pack the bag yourself? And did anyone give you anything to carry? The other day I answered the first question, then I added, 'And no-one gave me anything to carry.' The Israeli guard looked at me furious: 'How dare you? Don't you know : you are not allowed to answer the second question until I ask it?' \"David, that says it all.\"</p> <p>Albert and I part firm friends. And my own spirits are reflected in the cheerful air of Ramallah, the largest Arab city in the West Bank, where women wear dresses and where alcohol is served in the restaurants.</p> <p>On the way to the Presto cafe, where I am to meet the producer of Romeo and Juliet, Muna explains that George Ibrahim is one of the few people in Palestine allowed to make theatre. On arrival, George turns out to be bear-like and convivial, punching my arm whenever he makes a good point.</p> <p>George attacks the portrayal of Arabs in western films. \"We are always just puppets. You play with us according to your imagination, so we are monkeys smoking pipes, or more usually, criminals. I hate Hamas myself, so I know that extremists are criminals. But I also know why. I know why they commit crimes. Think! Just think! Think what depths of despair it will take to make you walk into a market with lumps of dynamite tied round your chest. But no American film-maker has ever tried to think. All Arabs get lumped together.\"</p> <p>His friend, the poet of the intifada, Hussein Barghouti joins in. \"Did you see... did you see The English Patient? Foreground action: white people, noble, fine feelings, strong, full of laughter, walking in gardens, taking showers, oh standing up! Background action: Arabs, shifty, mysterious, dirty, untrustworthy, oh sitting down! Or Air Force One! This picture explains to us what Arabs want. What do they want? To capture the American president! Why? Why would anyone want the American president? Why would they do that? No, really? The reason? Because the world needs an enemy. When the Soviet Union was around, there it was, ready-made. Now it's to be us. It suits the Americans to say, 'Who are the Arabs? The Arabs are the people who will start the third world war.'</p> <p>\"You know, I have been reading Mishima and he is very moving on this subject. The destruction of Japanese culture by the west. The west injecting violence into a culture. All the conflicts in this area are imported. They are not organic. The west came here to find its religion. Yet how did you bring it back to us? In the form of the Crusades! You collect your religion from this part of the world, then you bring it back to us as violence.\"</p> <p>I'm happy in Ramallah, it's less desperate, less disturbing than Gaza, but every night I travel back to Jerusalem, where not only half the world's religions originated but also - hardly by coincidence - where the world first started collecting crime statistics. Yes, Crime Number One. It happened in Jerusalem. Cain killed Abel. </p> <p>At Oslo, the question of how Jerusalem should be administered was put to one side as being simply too difficult even to approach. For this Jerusalem is the world capital of claim and counter-claim, the acknowledged metropolis of dispute. Here, contention, abrasion and mistrust are scored deep into the subtly pink rock. </p> <p>\"The angry face of Yahweh,\" says Arthur Koestler, \"broods over hot rocks which have seen more holy murder, rape and plunder than any other place on earth.\" \"The air over Jerusalem,\" says Herman Melville, \"is saturated with prayers and dreams... it's hard to breathe.\" For me, there's no question: I have to walk the Via Dolorosa, to follow the Stations of the Cross, which represent the steps on Christ's journey to his death. \"All these stones, all this sadness, all this light.\" It's the religion of my homeland, even if homeland's not a word I've ever used. But the shock is to realise just how little impact Christianity has made. It's amusing to see bus-loads of American evangelicals, dressed in shell suits and baseball caps, searching vainly in an old Arab city for any remaining evidence of Our Lord. \"There ought to be more. What's happened? Why is there not more?\"</p> <p>To be honest, I share their bewilderment. After all, Christianity's a well-known religion and I'd say influential in its day. You'd think it was still worth a pilgrimage, but in this town, we come a sporting third. We're the sideshow. The Via Dolorosa is a pavement which winds unimpressively past postcard shops and up narrow alleys, filling me with a sense of loss, with a tangible sense of something lost - until it reaches the Church of the Holy Sepulchre which - wouldn't you know, wouldn't you just guess it? - is also disputed. Yes, even the church which contains the stone where our Lord was crucified is shared unhappily: 70% to the Greeks and the rest doled out higgeldy-piggeldy between the Armenian Christians, the Coptic Christians, the Latins, the Syrians and the Ethiopians. A people divided by a common religion. Sects and the single church.</p> <p>And what's more - hold on, here we go - is the stone on the right spot? Nobody knows. Archaeologists also dispute. Nobody can know because nobody knows where the city walls were. Nobody agrees. Where was Calvary indeed? So for now - look, is anything certain? - let's just do as the family next to me and drop alarmingly to our knees, on the working assumption - let's just assume - X marks the spot, and kiss the stone. After all does the literal truth of it matter? Does the literal truth matter? Aren't we kissing an idea? Stones or ideas? Stones or ideas?</p> <p>And it's a relief, I'd say a relief, to come out of the dark and stroll down to the big open plaza where you find the Wailing Wall, strangely impressive, tall, uncrowded, the bit where the Jews are allowed. For towering above them at the very top of the arrangement, is the most coveted spot in the universe of faith, what the Jews call Temple Mount, but what to the Arabs who occupy it is known as the Haram al-Sharif. And at its centre, the saffron-yellow golden Dome of the Rock.</p> <p>I have felt since I arrived that Jerusalem doesn't need my admiration. Enough people are obsessed with it already. The truth is, I look at it and think how beautiful it must have been when it was a small town. Myself, I would like Jerusalem more if it were less important. But even I, inside the Arab sanctuary, taking in the cleanest, most oxygenated sun-dazzled air you ever breathed, looking across to the Mount of Olives, yield to the splendour of the place and realise: oh I see, how provoking it is to own beauty, to own the most breathtaking space of them all.</p> <p>Coming down, Sigal is waiting. I haven't seen the delightful Sigal for some time, because I have been, as it were, with the other lot, and so she is spilling over with gossip: Netanyahu's government is falling, or is about to fall, or may not fall, because of some scandal about money and loans. I get into the car. The driver doesn't know the city, so we circle for some time. It's interesting. When we stop people in the street to ask them the way to Yad Vashem, the world-famous museum of the Holocaust, some of them don't seem to know.</p> <p>The museum's power is in its very simplicity, a bleak photographic record ending not, as westerners expect, in 1945, but in 1948 at the foundation of the state. At the centre of the display, I stop at the text of Himmler's speech, the most astonishing document of the war, in which he congratulates his men on the discipline they have shown in exerting what he calls their \"moral right\" to exterminate the Jews.</p> <p>It is, Himmler says, \"natural tact\" which prevents any German from speaking of what they are doing. Himmler knows it is hard work, digging pits and throwing bodies into them. But what he is proudest of is that in doing this work his men have - the phrase resonates down the century - his men have \"stayed decent\", and it is staying decent \"that has made us hard\".</p> <p>The only false notes in the museum are hit by works of art. Sculpture and painting. They seem superfluous. In every case the gesture seems inadequate. What is a painting, a painting of a starving man? What is a painting of a corpse? It's the facts we want. Give us the facts. We go into the dark, into the Hall of Names. Here, every Jew who is known to have died between 1939 and 1945 is given a simple file. Finally, after so many years, numbers are given the dignity of becoming human beings. In this sombre room of open shelves, the scale of the Nazi offence, its deliberateness is revealed. The unbroken rank of documentation hits you more shockingly, more woundingly, than any other image. </p> <p>We walk in the Garden of Remembrance. We begin to feel the sun. Voltaire said you must choose between countries where you sweat and countries where you think. The confusing thing about Israel is that it's one where you do both. And my mind is racing now. We're all blind. We all see only what we want to. Don't we blank out the rest?</p> <p>And me more than anyone. At times I'm the worst of the lot. I've seen a good many politicians while I'm here but at the end I'm due to meet one who's lost all hope of office. I'm used to hours getting past the security arrangements for the minister of something or other, but my last visit is to a tiny, unsecured basement in Tel-Aviv. I have already noticed that just the name of Shulamit Aloni is enough to attract violent hostility from some who knew her as the flaming red firebrand of the Rabin government.</p> <p>And as she comes already talking into the room she is like a manic depressive Melina Mercouri with thick glasses and no time to wait for the questions.</p> <p>\"What you want to know?\" she asks, throwing herself down into the biggest armchair. \"Why do you say it's difficult to understand what's happening? It couldn't be simpler. We're going backwards. What's so difficult to understand? Jews were once victims, so we are brainwashed to believe we will always be victims and victims can do no wrong. Suddenly we've become strong and greedy and pretend we can justify everything. We're told all the time the Palestinians want to throw us into the sea. We have six million people and the strongest army in the region. And yet we speak of them as if they were two equal powers. It's just manipulating peoples' fears.\"</p> <p>She raps out an order in Hebrew for Sigal to go and get some coffee. Sigal gets up, furious, while Shulamit carries on, blaming the reversal entirely on Netanyahu. I am enjoying Shulamit - she is absolutely, as they say, my cup of tea - but even I am a little surprised by her blaming Netanyahu for everything. Are things ever really down to one man? \"You are English and I assume you went to high school\" she says, rather nastily, \"so you will have heard of the philosopher Hobbes. Hobbes says a whole society can be destroyed by a single individual who decides to come along and burn down the forest. Netanyahu, aided by the greedy fascists, the army, the security service, is such a man.\"</p> <p>I ask what she can do meanwhile. Does she just wait? \"To wait means to die. I have no optimistic things to tell you. Why come to me? What are you doing here? Go to the younger people and ask them what they think.\" She is staring at me, as if it's the first time she's noticed me at all. \"Why you write down my blah-blah?\"</p> <p>I say that I normally start an interview by explaining what I am doing here, but somehow we had skipped that stage. \"It's a bad time. What can I say?\" \"It's what you feel.\" \"No, it's not what I feel. It's what I know. If it were only what I feel I'd go and have a brandy and I'd feel better. I'm not telling you my mood, though my mood is bad. I'm telling you the facts. I am gloomy. But what do I matter?\"</p> <p>She looks me in the eye, challenging me to defy her. This talented lawyer, who has done as much as anyone to offer practical support to the victims of discrimination and segregation, is lost, in pain, painfully lost and spoiling for a fight. \"What do you see happening next?\" \"Demonstrations, bloodshed, bitterness. It's not yet a civil war, but it's a form of civil war. It's a Kulturkampf. Do you know what that is?\" I nod. \"We are in the middle of one. The great mistake was to give power to the clergy in the first place. And immigrants came from eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, they were backward, they knew nothing about democracy. They think democracy is the rule by the majority. What's worst, we have no written constitution...\" I have not opened my mouth and already she is shouting at me. \"Don't tell me you don't have one in England! I know that! I know that! But you have the Magna Carta and Oliver Cromwell and a tradition, and until recently you had the idea that certain things are not done.\"</p> <p>She gets up. It ends as abruptly as it begins. \"Anything else? I have to run.\" I am aware this woman's world was destroyed by Rabin's death. She shakes my hand. \"The British caused a lot of problems here.\" \"I know that\". \"Do you know what I say to the British? Since you left, we love you very much. And I mean it. We do.\"</p> <p>We walk back to the British Council, Sigal fuming at the way Shulamit insulted her. I start collating my notes in the office. A British Council worker comes in, called George. He is a Christian Arab. \"He is my enemy,\" says Sigal and they both roar with laughter contentedly. Shulamit Aloni rings to ask us both to pardon her for being what she calls \"impatient and obnoxious\". She is worn down, she says, by the weight of her case-work.</p> <p>We set off for the airport. On the way in, I have been advised not to let them stamp my passport so that I can visit Arab countries. But, on the way out, before I can say a word, WHAM, not a second to speak, and the word ISRAEL is on my passport for ever.</p> <p>(At this point the lights shift, and the feel of the stage is changed for the epilogue) Gatwick. My plane is late. I return in the middle of the night. I get on the slow train to Victoria. </p> <p>Darkness. </p> <p>The Israeli military commander, unnamed at his own request, who sits across a desk smiling, telling me that only 20,000 Jews have been killed in the cause of setting up the state. \"Not that every death isn't a tragedy, please don't misunderstand me, and of course I'm not talking about the Jewish experience in Europe. But the Jewish experience in this part of the world? 20,000 to set up a whole country: that's not so bad, you know. Not bad. Not for a whole state.\" Victoria station deserted. Into a friendly black cab. Up past Buckingham Palace, Park Lane, and north towards the suburbs, up the Finchley Road. Leafy street after leafy street of sleeping houses, sleeping bodies, sleeping hearts. Passion receding up the broad tree-lined avenues. Haider Abdel Shafi quoting Mohammed on his return from battle. \"I come back from the little strife and I return to the greater. The strife of the soul.\"</p> <p>Sitting in the harbour with Eran Baniel, eating fish. \"Fuck the land! Fuck it! What does the land matter? The highest value to a Jew is human life. The idea that stones now matter more than lives is a complete deformation of the Jewish religion. A deformation!\"</p> <p>Left on Chapel Street. Tall terraces of impeccable Georgian houses on either side. I think of David Grossman walking on the Heath. \"I have some sort of mineral reaction,\" he said. Pauline, in the boarding house in Gaza: \"There was a point once, there was a reason. You were fighting for a Palestinian state, and you were willing to die. What on earth would you die for now?\"</p> <p>The taxi turns right and right again. Are we where we live, or are we what we think? What matters? Stones or ideas? Stones or ideas?</p> <p>My dog Blanche waking in the night to greet me, the heavy white door of my home closing behind me.</p> <p>Via Dolorosa.</p>",
  "<p>Unlike taking a gap year nowadays, when Richard Huntingford set off for Australia with just \u00a350 in his pocket in 1973, travelling involved a strong element of pioneering. </p> <p>\"I was 17 and had just left school. At that age you really didn't need a degree and I learned far more in that year than I would have done at college. I had to learn to manage myself,\" he says. He remembers a job which involved cleaning the fat filter at a McDonald's. </p> <p>Cut to nearly 30 years later, and Mr Huntingford, now group managing director of Chrysalis, the radio group which now has a weekly audience of four million people, says it was this experience which helped carry him through two major business disappointments: losing the bid for the Yorkshire TV area and losing the bid for a radio licence in the north-west. </p> <p>But back to the 70s, and his return from Australia. He knew that he wanted to train in a profession, which then meant law (too much learning), medicine (he was not of a scientific bent) or accountancy. Accountancy won and he joined what was then Peat Marwick Mitchell and is now KPMG, auditing companies by day and studying for his exams by night. </p> <p>\"I didn't intend to stay there for very long, but it's a big pyramid structure and provided you are doing the job OK, every year you continue to get more interesting jobs with better pay. So I stayed for 10 years.\" One client was MAM, a leisure company which had been approached by record company Chrysalis with a view to a reverse takeover of the smaller operation to give it a stockmarket listing. </p> <p>He spent six months getting to know the company, and a year later was offered a position on the board as director of corporate development. \"I was a year off being made partner at KPMG, so everyone thought I was mad for leaving. But as soon as I got the call, I knew it was the right thing to do.\" </p> <p>But just a year later the business had gone from being hugely sucessful to one with plunging profitability. The problems lay in the US where huge marketing costs were not being supported and sales were falling; within 18 months it was $50m in the red. \"My job became one of corporate retrenchment. It was obvious that a structured plan was needed so my boss, group chairman Chris Wright, made a deal with EMI selling them half of the loss-making record label for $100m. I suddenly had a large cash pile and could go back to doing to job I was recruited to do.\" </p> <p>He started looking towards television as a future direction now the record label had gone. The 1990 Broadcasting Act of 1990 set in motion the auctions for the ITV licences. Chrysalis formed White Rose, a consortium bidding for the Yorkshire area licence. It failed. </p> <p>\"This was a big disappointment for us, but in evaluating how much we could reasonably afford to bid we carried out a modelling exercise and lots of analysis. It was during this time that we looked at commercial radio, which at that time was taking just 2% of advertising revenue. </p> <p>\"While researching Chrysalis' businesses in the US I realised that commercial radio was bigger over there than over here, where the only service available were top 40 stations on FM and gold stations on AM, playing 60s music. There was no one appealing to the adult contemporary market.\" </p> <p>In the same Broadcasting Act were clauses providing for a raft of new regional radio licences. \"We did a lot of research and decided to bid for the Heart licence. The first one up for grabs was in the north-west,\" he says. But it went to JazzFM. \"I've always been a realist and I still believed we were right to go after this 25-44 audience.\" </p> <p>Chrysalis bid for the Midlands Heart licence in 1994 and won. \"Next the two Greater London licences came up for auction and I knew it was crucial to get one of these. We were one of 43 applicants for two licences and put a huge effort behind the campaign. The date we were due to receive notification of whether or not we had been sucessful was Friday October 7. My secretary and I sorted through six postbags to find a letter from the Radio Authority addressed to me. We got it, and I knew that this was our big break.\" </p> <p>Chrysalis is now the fourth largest commercial radio group in the country with licences covering every metropolitan area in England and Wales. Fat filters must seem a long way away.</p>",
  "It's usually pretty easy to predict which pop stars will end up confessing all to the tabloids in one of those \"My Drug Hell\" pieces. Marti Pellow definitely wasn't one of them. The chipper housewives' choice who led Glasgow's Wet Wet Wet to 26 hit singles (including the sickeningly sincere Love Is All Around, which stayed at number one for 15 long weeks in 1994) was the good boy in a profession of delinquents and misfits. Aptly nicknamed Smiler since schooldays, his only addiction seemed to be an attachment to the old R&amp;B albums that inspired him to form a band back in the mid-80s. He was the Ronan Keating of his day, the perfect gent with no bad habits. <p>That was before the revelation, in February 1999, that Smiler wasn't so well-adjusted after all - he collapsed at the Conrad Hotel in Chelsea, west London, from an apparent drugs binge. The shock had barely subsided before his girlfriend, a former Miss Scotland named Eileen Catterson, revealed the even more unlikely truth: he had been on heroin for three years, and on the day in question became ill from \"unintentionally\" mixing alcohol with prescription drugs that he was using to withdraw from the heroin. </p> <p>It was passed off as an accident, but Pellow now admits, \"I was weaning myself off smack with methadone and Librium, yet I was still self-destructive, so I thought, 'Have a drink!' I drank copious amounts of vodka and Strega for two or three hours, and collapsed.\" </p> <p>My drugs hell, indeed. Suddenly Pellow, who had been quietly forgotten about since Wet Wet Wet's long run of hits ended in 1997, was front-page news again. It wasn't just the drugs that shocked, but the realisation that, in an age where celebrities compulsively air their private lives, so little was known of his. He'd been a major star, and his relationship with Catterson made them the Caledonian equivalent of Posh and Becks, but he had seemed so uninterestingly normal that the media had left him alone. </p> <p>\"He was the clean-cut boy with the nice grin, so when people found out he was a heavy drugs user they were so shocked, especially because there were never even any rumours,\" says a Scottish tabloid reporter. His former publicist, Linda Valentine, adds, \"I was completely stunned when I heard, because I'd had chats about heroin with him and he knew it was a disaster area.\" </p> <p>Pellow has maintained a wary silence until now. He's never been one for five-page spreads in Hello! anyway, but now he needed space to pull himself together as he prepared to relaunch his career. His debut solo album will be released early next year, and next month he begins a tour in which he'll be playing his new music. Finally he's feeling more confident about talking publicly. </p> <p>\"I'm more in touch with my feelings now,\" he says wryly. \"A while ago, I had a really weird feeling of impending doom and I got really uptight - you know the kind of thing? And my friends who'd been in the same situation, they said, 'It's just a feeling, Marti.'\" He shakes his head in wonder, almost embarrassed. </p> <p>He has the air of a man who has the chance of making a new beginning and is going to make the most of it as he takes a seat in a restaurant near Kensington Palace and orders a cappuccino - caffeine being the only drug, other than nicotine, in which he still indulges. Clean since July 1999, and a conscientious attender of Narcotics Anonymous meetings, Pellow is evangelical about the NA programme, which he says changed his life. He's on the fourth step, which advises \"making a moral inventory\". Apparently, this is the most difficult step, because it requires complete honesty on the addict's part. He says that it has forced him to rethink his priorities: \"That step's a long-term project. Living with an addict is so frustrating because [other people] want to help, but it's got to come from the addict,\" he says in an accent that remains crunchy despite 13 years spent mostly outside Scotland. \"Sobriety has been humbling, being in these rooms [at NA meetings]. There's a great cross-section of people. I hadn't done shit in 10 years because everything was done for me. I paid wages, so I didn't have to think of anything. Check myself on to a plane? Get my passport? 'This way, Mr Pellow, this way.' If it happens long enough, it becomes the norm. For me, it's been a real godsend that I can get in touch with my feelings.\" </p> <p>He speaks with the earnestness of the newly sober, so absorbed that he's soon leaning forward and making unwavering eye contact. After three years of drug abuse he is still handsome enough - or famous enough - for the waitress to flutter a bit as she brings his coffee. He's rather too thin - he's 5ft 11in and claims he was down to nine-and-a-half stone during his worst patch - but, physically, has weathered pretty well. The only outward sign of his travails is one of those mood bracelets, black for \"peace and serenity\", worn on the opposite wrist from a dangly gold Cartier watch. The latter was a gift from Elton John's ex-manager, John Reid, who managed Pellow for a short time last year before they split in mysterious circumstances that neither is willing to discuss. </p> <p>It's late morning, and Pellow is in talkative mood. I'd been told as much by his new songwriting partner, former Squeeze singer Chris Difford (the Cockney baritone on Cool For Cats). The two met in the Priory, where Difford was being treated for cocaine addiction, and Difford now functions as lyricist and unofficial helper. He ushers us to a table, gives Pellow a paternally anxious glance and adjourns to the lobby, where he settles down with a copy of the Mirror. Difford's involvement has been questioned by Pellow's former manager from the Wet Wet Wet years, Elliot Davies, from whom he split last year - \"Chris Difford has never managed a band in his life,\" Davies gripes - but it's clear that his role is more to do with emotional support than business. </p> <p>Pellow talks with hardly a pause for two hours, sketching the 5am panic of running out of drugs, the Florida cottage where he spent Christmas 1998 alone and desperate, how he felt finishing treatment and going straight back on to heroin. \"I was depressed every day. There was a tremendous amount of isolation. Just leave me alone with my drug of choice,\" he remembers. </p> <p>Yet there were never any rumours because he seemed so happy in his job as frontman of Scotland's biggest band. A natural attention-seeker, he was completely at home in front of huge audiences (a situation that occurred less often as the 90s wore on), flourishing under the spotlight. When his looks got him more notice than the rest of Wet Wet Wet, he didn't even pretend to be embarrassed. Some musicians find touring a necessary evil; for Pellow, it was an opportunity to bask in his public's approval. Linda Valentine says, \"He was a charmer who just wanted to be liked. In the early days, when he finished a show, he'd go to the gym. I never even saw him smoke a spliff.\" </p> <p>Yet once Wet Wet Wet's career peaked with Love Is All Around and began a gentle downward slide, he needed numbing drugs just to get through the day. What he's never talked about until now is the lifelong sense of emptiness that drove him to find validation on stage: \"I'd like to have thought I was a normal working-class kid, but I can remember being six or seven at school, and at the end of the day I would go off alone. I always felt there was something missing. I'd want to be with people, but then I couldn't because I could only take so much. The most poignant thing about my childhood was that I was always alone. When I discovered things - like the first time I've ever seen this tunnel or whatever, the things that kids do together - I'd do it alone.\" </p> <p>It's an equation that you keep encountering in the music business: an empty childhood plus a craving for attention equals a troubled pop star. \"Big ego plus low self-esteem? That's the makings of an addict,\" points out a friend of mine who has grappled with addiction himself. But what's unclear, and even Pellow can't put his finger on it, is the source of this emptiness. His family, who come from a working-class part of Glasgow called Clydebank, was happy, he says, and even exceptionally attractive. His father was a bricklayer, his mother a singer and Marti, whose real name is Mark McLachlan, and his older brother John were the apples of their eye. John, who at 38 is three years Marti's senior, has been an alcoholic for some years. \"He's working through it, but it's got to come from him,\" he sighs. </p> <p>\"Is it better to be good-looking?\" Pellow muses. \"Ask John Merrick, the Elephant Man. Being nice-looking and a great singer ... can I have all that and credibility, too?\" </p> <p>Ah, the C-word. Musical credibility has always been at the top of his wish-list, and the lack of same has been a thorn in his side for years. Not that he isn't justly renowned for his expressive voice - an early NME review advised him to ditch the rest of Wet Wet Wet - but real kudos somehow eludes him. When lists of classic British male vocalists are compiled, he's rarely included - overlooked, perhaps, or maybe just too identified with Wet Wet Wet's period of teen-idoldom. He never wanted to be a pop star in the first place, seeing himself and schoolfriends Graeme Clark, Tommy Cunningham and Neil Mitchell as inheritors of a Celtic white-soul tradition stretching back to the Average White Band in the 70s. Their heroes were Al Green and Marvin Gaye, unusual influences for a young band in the middle of the Culture Club 80s. </p> <p>Studying their musty vinyl records as if they were texts, Wet Wet Wet developed a soul-tinged sound that was hugely successful with the public but never quite passed muster with the critics. The Virgin Encyclopaedia Of Popular Music sniffs that they were \"agreeable blue-eyed soul\", while others derided them as \"faceless\" or \"innocuous\". Pellow's silky singing was praised by Al Green's producer, Willie Mitchell, as the best he'd heard since Green himself, but the package as a whole attracted slatings that stopped the Wets rising to the superleague. In a tangential way, much of the negativity was generated by Pellow himself or, rather, by his looks. With a face like his, he was a bespoke teen idol, and the teen 'zines pounced as soon as the band's debut single, Wishing I Was Lucky, came out in April 1987. With his first Smash Hits cover went any hope of credibility. Worse, he seemed unsure of which side of the fence he was on, anxious as he was for both populist adulation and critical plaudits. </p> <p>Wet Wet Wet also had the bad luck to come along just as British pop was about to be purged by the Madchester movement. The Wets - unfortunate abbreviation - suddenly looked like earnest traditionalists in stonewashed denim. So, while they were commercially hot, selling 2.5 million copies of their first album, Popped In, Souled Out, the more adult press never took them seriously. It bothered Pellow - a lot. </p> <p>\"Credibility and success never came hand in hand,\" he says resignedly. \"We had the success, so who was I searching for to say it's okay? The magazines, the papers? Within the nucleus of the band, they were annoyed that I was singled out. They got used to it after a few albums, because they got an extra hour in bed.\" </p> <p>As Wishing I Was Lucky became the first of 26 hits, they quickly got rich, too. Fresh off the dole, they indulged themselves like lottery winners. It wasn't just Ferraris (Pellow had two) and big houses, but larks such as having curries flown from their favourite Glasgow takeaway, Cafe India, to gigs in Europe. \"Who cares how much it cost?\" he says, still amused. \"It made sense at the time. A lot of stuff like that went on. We were young guys with lots of money and no ties and not a care in the world. I look back and think how amazing it was, first time in Paris, the Eiffel Tower, Australia. I'd never even been out of the UK before.\" </p> <p> He still can't quite articulate what he sought from drugs, just that an indefinable something was missing from an otherwise enviable life. He had \u00a33 million in the bank, the esteem of fans and a long-term relationship with the supportive Catterson. And yet, he gropes to explain, \"it became hard work\". </p> <p>It is currently fashionable for pop stars to insist that, despite achieving everything they have ever hoped for, it hasn't filled the void within. Robbie Williams claims that being rich and adored has left him \"in bits\", while Spice Girl Mel C recently admitted to being on anti-depressants. The term \"paradise syndrome\" has been coined to describe the feeling, pithily summed up by the late Michael Hutchence, of \"getting to the top and finding there's nothing there\". When it hit Pellow, 10 years into his career, he smothered the feeling with the strongest medication he could find. </p> <p>\"The heroin started around 1996. I had always dabbled in other drugs and I was really drinking heavily by then, big time. Life was great, and I should have been happy, but ... I had the cars, the big house, but I lived in the servants' quarters. What's that all about? It was bullshit.\" </p> <p>He swirls his coffee and props his chin in his hand, looking unhappy. \"I suddenly thought that there's not a day gone by that I haven't had a drink in the past five years. I'd binge for two or three days at a time. And then, as soon as I first tried heroin, I thought, 'Where has this been?' I'd found my private Idaho. What a pain reliever. It made me feel whole, made me feel ...\" He pauses, searching for the word. </p> <p>Warm? He nods emphatically. \"It's still crazy for me. I knew smackheads in the [housing] schemes and I used to think, 'I'll never do that', but when I started, I thought, 'This is what it's all about.'\" His use quickly escalated. \"As soon as I started, I wanted it all the time. I stopped drinking, substituting one for another. It was about self-medicating, making myself numb. I kept piling shite on, piling it on. I felt very dark. At Christmas 1998, I didn't want to be with anyone I knew, so I stayed alone in a cabin. I called my mother and Eileen to wish them happy Christmas and managed to sound happy. But I'd be up at 5am and run out of drugs and be having cold sweats and think, 'Fuck, why am I doing this?' I'd get occasional little moments of clarity and see pain on the faces of my family.\" </p> <p>He had tried rehab in the summer of 1998 at the Meadows clinic in Arizona, but bought more drugs the day he left. \"They told me that I'd have to commit to a lifetime of sobriety, and I was like, 'Aaaahh!' But I had more knowledge of my disease after that, so using was never the same again. My disease wanted me dead. I was afraid to stand in front of the sun because [I thought] you'd see all my internal organs. Everyone in the Wet Wet Wet camp acknowledged the problem, but I was still in denial.\" </p> <p>Then came his collapse at the Conrad Hotel, after which he checked into the Priory and became the latest popster to begin the well-trodden road to recovery. He grins almost fondly. \"My charm did not work in the slightest at the Priory. My smile was the first thing to go.\" He spent six weeks there, and his first act on leaving was to quit the band - against manager Elliot Davies's wishes. \"The best chance he has of getting back to his best is to get back to Wet Wet Wet,\" Davies still maintains a year later. Pellow disagrees. </p> <p>That he has thrown himself into sobriety is obvious from a vocabulary that's dotted with words such as \"sharing\" and \"co-dependence\". Sometimes, he goes to more than one NA meeting a day, and says that he takes his recovery a day at a time. He's been proactive, finding new management and making a new album, which is said to be adult pop with a soulful twist. He recorded it in Memphis with Willie Mitchell, who apparently amused him during the sessions by telling stories about his old buddy Martin Luther King. \"The feel is real, it's me. There's a dignity and simplicity to the songwriting I've never had before,\" he says, relieved to be talking about music, still his chief passion. </p> <p>Pellow is now a member of that very Y2K club of celebrities who nearly fell off the edge and were pulled back by a combination of therapy and abstinence. His experience has made him a more rounded individual, but for those to whom he'll always be Smiler it is still a shock. If even Smiler couldn't hack success, can any other supposedly wholesome star be quite what they seem? </p> <p> \u0095 Marti Pellow's tour begins on November 10 at the Manchester Apollo and finishes at the Clyde Auditorium, Glasgow, on November 21, taking in the Albert Hall, London, on November 13 and 14.</p>",
  "<p>This autumn is a great time for bargain-hunters. The UK's latest factory shopping village, the McArthurGlen Designer Outlet in Livingston, Scotland, opened this week offering 30%-70% off the normal retail prices of more than 100 well-known brands under one roof plus themed restaurants, an eight-screen cinema and a fitness centre. </p> <p>Also launched this week was the eighth edition of that bargain-hunter's bible The Good Deal Directory 2001, which provides county-by-county listings of 2,800 factory shops, permanent discount outlets, dress agencies and architectural salvage sites in the UK with money-saving tips on buying top brand names at discount prices. </p> <p>The book is accompanied by a new website, <a href=\"http://www.gooddealdirectory.co.uk\">www.gooddealdirectory.co.uk</a>, which, as well as listing factory villages and other discount outlets, offers the latest news on sales and bargains around the country and a search facility for shoppers trying to track down specific cut-price brand names in their area. </p> <p>The latest big name to join the discount scene is Marks &amp; Spencer, which is opening its first three factory shops in the next month at Ashford, Kent (November 2), Cheshire Oaks, South Wirral (November 9) and the new Livingston site (November 16). </p> <p>Among bargains to be had at the M&amp;S cut-price stores will be ladies' silk cashmere cardigans down from \u00a375 to \u00a337.50, men's wool suits down from \u00a3150 to \u00a375, ladies' leather shoes down from \u00a335 to \u00a320 and ladies' satin pyjamas down from \u00a325 to \u00a315. </p> <p>There are about 1,500 individual factory shops in the UK, many of them in isolated spots or on industrial estates, selling manufacturers' surplus stock - cancelled orders, returned merchandise, over-production, seconds and discontinued lines - at prices much below those in the high street shops which the factory supplies. </p> <p>\"Discounts vary, but in general they are higher in the fashion sector, where an outfit can become out of date very quickly and where mark-ups can be as high as 280%, and lower in ceramics and glassware,\" says Noelle Walsh, author of The Good Deal Directory. \"The older the item is, the cheaper the price. As a general rule, you can expect at least 30% off and up to 80%.\" </p> <p>In the 90s developers started gathering together lots of these shops on one site in factory shopping villages ranging in size from K Village in Kendal, Cumbria, with a dozen shops, to McArthurGlen's Cheshire Oaks village in South Wirral with more than 150. With new villages due to open during 2001 at Harwich in Essex, Lichfield in the west midlands and at Salford Quays in Manchester, there will be at least 35 by the end of next year. </p> <p>Best for label snobs and fashion aficionados, according to Noelle Walsh, is Bicester Village in Oxfordshire, boasting more than 70 shops with prices reduced by up to 60%, and McArthurGlen's York outlet, currently with 75 shops and 150 more planned. </p> <p>Home-loving families looking for children's wear should head for Clarks Village at Street in Somerset and McArthurGlen villages in Swindon and Cheshire Oaks. </p> <p>And if you want to combine bargain shopping with a fun day out for the family, best bets will be the Clacton Factory Outlet Village in Essex and the Freeport Shopping Village in Fleetwood, Lancashire, which both have seaside locations offering plenty of leisure facilities such as children's play areas and rides. </p> <p><strong>Top tips for factory shop bargain hunters</strong></p> <p>Visit villages if possible on a week day when things are quiet - 80% of factory village shopping customers visit on a weekend. </p> <p>Although they don't advertise the fact, most factory villages slash prices still further at traditional high street sale times - January and June/July. The downside is that your choice of lines will be more limited at sale times. </p> <p>Best buys are always the more expensive items. So use factory shopping as a chance to \"go up a brand\" from those you can normally afford. </p> <p> Turnover is usually very fast. So if you like something, buy it; you are unlikely to find it again. </p> <p>Carry the measurements of rooms, windows and family members with you so that you are prepared to snap up bargains as and when you spot them. </p> <p>Never travel a long way without phoning first to check opening hours and directions. If you are after particular brand names, also check first on stock levels. </p> <p>When buying discounted goods, you have the same rights under the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and the Consumer Protection Act 1987 as you would in mainstream shops. </p> <p> Check if an item is a sec ond. You'll usually find a label on the garment stating why this is so. Although your statutory rights are in place at factory shops, you can't return a second because of a fault indicated at the outset. </p> <p>Items are not always as flatteringly presented as in high street stores, so be prepared to rummage. </p> <p>If you are looking for the height of fashion, factory shopping isn't for you. But factory shopping is great for children's clothes, jeans, leisure wear, sweaters, underwear and classic items which don't date such as blazers, coats and raincoats. </p> <p>\u0095 The Good Deal Directory 2001, costing \u00a39.99 plus \u00a31 p&amp;p, can be ordered on 01367-860016 or via the website, <a href=\"http://www.gooddealdirectory.co.uk\">www.gooddealdirectory.co.uk</a>.

  "Palestinian leaders trying to give some direction to the bloody protests that have gone on for a month said yesterday they were gearing up for an even more violent struggle against Israel, including attacks on military posts and suicide bombings. <p>In the last fortnight, popular leaders from Yasser Arafat's Fatah organisation have joined hands with Hamas and Islamic Jihad to try to steer their followers away from the unequal confrontations between stone-throwing teenagers and troops armed with high-velocity rifles and backed up by tanks and helicopter gunships, which have killed more than 130 people, almost all Palestinians. </p> <p>Yesterday, as Israeli forces split Gaza in two, tearing out trees and sealing the main road at Kfar Darom near the site of a suicide bomb attack two days ago, Mr Arafat's chief lieutenant in the territory said he was under growing pressure to deploy Fatah's armed activists, the tanzim, in expectation of an Israeli attack. </p> <p>\"When the decision comes, the only choice will be to use the military, and all Palestinians will be behind that choice,\" said Ahmed Hillis, the Gaza leader of Fatah. \"I believe we are moving closer and closer to violence.\" </p> <p>The spur for the transformation of the Jerusalem-centred intifada (uprising) into an armed struggle was Thursday's suicide bombing in Gaza. The bomber, who cycled up to an Israeli post, failed to kill, or seriously wound, a single soldier. But the crowds jostling to touch his casket at his funeral in Gaza hailed him as a martyr yesterday. </p> <p>A bearded leader of the Islamic Jihad, perched on a lorry leading the procession, told the crowds that Nabil al-Araeer had not died in vain. \"Don't believe the media,\" he yelled through a megaphone. \"He killed at least four soldiers, and wounded 10.\" </p> <p>At the burial ground, he read out the suicide note left by the kindergarten worker. \"Thank God I am headed where I have always wanted to go.\" </p> <p>That was no consolation for Nabil's father, Faraj al-Araeer, a broken man slumped in a plastic chair outside his Gaza home. \"I never knew who he was,\" he said. \"It must have been the new situation, with all the violence. He was planning to go to university.\" </p> <p>He sighed. \"I have my goals, and he had his goal. We are completely different.\" </p> <p>As thousands watched the funeral crowds, some clasping grenades and the black flags of the Islamic Jihad, only a few dared to question Araeer's sacrifice. \"This was a suicide for nothing. He died for nothing,\" said Nahid Eyada, who owns a flour mill next to the Araeer family home. As other shops downed their shutters in honour of the dead bomber, his stayed defiantly open. </p> <p>\"Look at what is going to happen. Other people are going to die. The leaders send them to kill themselves, and they sit on their plush chairs,\" he said. \"There has to be another way.\" </p> <p>But those options are shrinking. Yesterday's funeral was broadcast on Palestinian official television, further evidence of the alliance between Fatah, and the Islamic militants whose opposition to the peace process once made them hunted men in Gaza. </p> <p>For five years, the intelligence services of the Palestinian Authority did Israel's work, locking up bombers and other Islamic militants without trial. But two weeks ago, some 40 Hamas militants were released in Gaza, and at least five or six are still at large. </p> <p>On Sunday, CIA officials told the Palestinian Authority to hand over the activists within 24 hours. The security services refused, at the risk of a rupture in their relations with Washington. </p> <p>\"I don't think that after the Israeli attacks, and this emergency situation that they have time to look for anybody,\" said Ismail Abu Shanab, a leading Hamas figure in Gaza. \"They do not feel any longer that these Hamas prisoners are a danger to the Palestinian Authority.\" </p> <p>Although Fatah and the Islamist groups are presenting a united front, deep divisions remain on tactics. </p> <p>Hamas preaches that any Israeli, civilian or soldier, in the West Bank, Gaza or inside the borders of the Jewish state, is fair game. \"Anyone who carries a gun, and shoots at an Israeli target can do it on his own, and at a suitable time for him,\" said Abu Shanab. </p> <p>Fatah is adamant there be no operations inside Israel, for fear of provoking harsh reprisals on the Palestinian population. But Mr Hillis admits that Fatah does not have absolute control; that was the message of Thursday's bombing. </p> <p>\"You have to understand that the intifada is no respecter of rules, and if someone wants to die nobody can stop that.\" </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\" target=\"_new\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\" target=\"_new\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party) <br></a><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "Lord Pitkerro drew the curtains to block out the press pack camped outside his house. He had said enough yesterday, and the era of the mobile phone was over. <p>For the hundredth time, he thought over what he and his fellow scientists had told the government. Had they taken caution too far? Had it been right, on virtually no evidence, to recommend banning mobile phone use for the under-18s and setting a five minute a day limit for adults? Had it been right to call for the dismantling of all phone antennae within a kilometre of inhabited buildings, rendering mobiles all but useless? True, nobody knew if they were safe, but nobody knew they weren't - yet. </p> <p>The Today programme said something about a financial crash brought about by the collapse in telecoms shares. In Finland, home of Nokia, the government had resigned. The papers were calling the Pitkerro report \"the safety culture gone mad\". The US and EU were denouncing him, even as skipfuls of British mobiles headed for the scrapheap.</p> <p>Well, one day they would thank him. Perhaps. </p> <p>It hasn't happened that way, of course. The real report this year into mobile phone safety, chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir William Stewart, hedged its bets on mobiles and masts by saying there was a faint risk of a risk, but did not call for any serious curbs on their use. </p> <p>Yet as the public asks in the wake of the BSE inquiry whether they can trust scientists to give it to them straight, fast and accurate on what is safe and what is not, it is worth considering how great the shock would have been if, in the late 1980s, the government's scientific advisers had recommended taking all the anti-BSE measures taken after 1996. </p> <p>Now we have come to terms with the vast pyres of cattle and the devastation of the British beef industry, because now we know BSE kills people. But how would a scientific panel's recommendation to slaughter hundreds of thousands of cows have gone down in, say, 1989, when cartoonists were still joshing about mad cows thinking they were Napoleon, and the rightwing press was railing against European attempts to ban \"our beef\"? </p> <p>John Adams, professor of geography at University College London and a specialist in risk, pointed out just how thin the scientific evidence was in the early days for a risk to humans from BSE. </p> <p>He said there were three categories of risk: directly perceptible risk, such as when food smells off; risks perceived through science, such as when scientists warn of a danger of HIV being spread through blood transfusion; and virtual risk. \"Virtual risk is where scientists confess ignorance or reputable scientists are disputing with each other about what's going on,\" he said. \"These are where you find the most acrimonious, longest running debates. BSE, for much of the controversy, was in this category.\" </p> <p>\"What, with the benefit of foresight, looked like a risk worth taking looks with hindsight and a clever lawyer like culpability. We have to make decisions about what to do on the basis of all this very unsatisfactory evidence. When something does go wrong, the mist clears and all other variables we were worried about drop away and leave a clear trail back to the culprit.\" </p> <p>All very well, but it does not let scientists off the hook. What they are under fire for in the BSE case is less their pure scientific method, or even their conclusions, than the way they allowed themselves and their opinions to be manipulated by civil servants. </p> <p>Why did they not push harder and shout louder to get more research funds to fill in the blank spots in our knowledge of BSE? Why did they not state more clearly the limits of their knowledge in the fields concerned and draw in experts from elsewhere? </p> <p>Alan Dickinson, now retired, was director of the neuropathogenesis unit in Edinburgh from 1981 to 1987 and is a top specialist in the family of diseases to which BSE belongs. He was never asked to join the government's advisory teams. </p> <p>\"The public should be wary of what the civil servants call experts,\" he said. \"Almost all the plethora of committees set up were populated by people who had no more idea than the man in the moon about the subject.\" </p> <p>Scientists and politicians had one thing in common: they stood or fell by their deeds. Bureaucrats did not. \"Politicians are just pawns in the hands of any civil servant who wishes to manipulate them. Science's strength is that people stick their names to what they believe to be the truth, and the whole design of democracy is dependent on named politicians ... If we don't design a system where civil servants have to put their names to what they do, we'll never get to the heart of this.\" </p> <p>As the Tory government's chief scientific adviser from 1990 to 1995, Sir William Stewart escaped with light burns from the BSE debacle, but in his report on the safety of mobile phones this year he was careful. \"We conclude,\" the key passage of the report said, \"that it is not possible at present to say that exposure to [mobile phone radiation], even at levels below national guidelines, is totally without potential adverse health effects, and that the gaps in knowledge are sufficient to justify a precautionary approach.\" </p> <p>In other words, we don't know whether mobiles are dangerous. Frustrating for the public, confusing; but honest, accurate and true to science. It is this message, say scientists, that should have emerged from science advisers in the early years of the BSE crisis - and would have, had they not allowed themselves to be used. </p> <p>\"Policymakers can't always assume scientists can give them precise advice,\" said Roy Anderson, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College and a relatively recent recruit to the government's ranks of BSE advisers. \"Scientists have to be prepared to say: 'We do not know.'\" </p> <p>Why are British scientists apparently ready to let Whitehall turn their uncertainty into certainty - as in the BSE case, where the Southwood committee's \"remote risk\" of harm to humans from eating beef turned into the government's \"beef is perfectly safe\"? </p> <p>David Tyrell, former head of the government's second set of BSE science advisers, Seac, admitted to the inquiry: \"We'd given up the idea of trying to stand back and evaluate science from a distance and impartially. I think that's part of what we got ourselves into, willy nilly.\" </p> <p>Prof Adams said that when scientists began to cohabit with bureaucrats and politicians they started to adopt their ways. They \"start thinking about how to form advice in the way that will actually make something happen. If they thought that going one step further would be dismissed, they back off.\" </p> <p>Ah, the fear of not being asked back - the carrot and stick of patronage. Many scientists mutter that political control over research funds, greatly strengthened in the 1980s, gives government an instrument to intimidate scientists into telling them what they want to hear. </p> <p>Nor are research funds and jobs the only form of patronage. Britain offers scientists the politically directed honour of a knighthood or a peerage. </p> <p>\"If you're regarded as a safe pair of hands and not one to rock the boat you're more likely to get public honours,\" said a scientist who asked not to be named. \"That's the perception ... There can be penalties for being very open and honest.\" </p> <p>One of the most damning criticisms of the Southwood committee and the bureaucrats who worked with it is that they failed to acknowledge the limits of their expertise. They did not submit their work to a review by other scientists. </p> <p>If you look at the research papers being published in the scientific journals today, two things strike you. One is that, as the targets of our understanding become more ambitious, it takes ever more resources to make each tiny incremental advance towards them; the other is how often institutes from more than one country are involved in the breakthroughs. It is not just that these are bad times for lone scientific geniuses: they are bad times for flagwaving about \"our\" scientists. </p> <p>In a sense there are no scientists any more, only specialists in different, narrowing branches of science. The lessons of the scientific response to the BSE crisis are that scientists have to do more to acknowledge publicly the fragmented, international nature of their profession, and not to let governments get away with glib phrases such as \"our top scientists.\" </p> <p>It would help - the Phillips report makes this point - if the government had a single chief scientific officer, with a contingency budget, to knock the heads together of in-house scientists from rival ministries, send out for the right advisers, and fund fast-track research. </p> <p>Scientists complain that the media distort their message or play scientists off against each other. Certainly the media like to jump out of the cupboard and shout \"Boo!\" at the public. Who can forget the Sun's miracle of front page compression a few days after the Chernobyl disaster? \"Six million red babes may die\" - horror, pity, anti-communism and bad science, all in eight syllables. </p> <p>Yet note the \"may\". Even the tabloid's tabloid was prepared to embrace the precautionary principle. Perhaps the scientists could get their message across better, if only they spoke the media's language. </p> <p>\"In the education of scientists, there should be a stronger emphasis on presenting complex information simply,\" said Prof Anderson. </p> <p>British scientists have warned us that smoking kills since the 1950s, but people are still buying cigarettes, getting lung cancer, and dying. Prof Adams pointed out that the public wanted scientific clarity on beef or mobiles or long distance air travel not to see these things removed from society, but so they could choose whether to use them. It was the sense of risk concealed that gave offence. </p> <p>\"The effect has been devastating,\" he said. \"That loss of public confidence is likely to be the most significant cost of this affair.\" </p> <p>The British science journal Nature said this week that it was not surprising that many scientists in agriculture kept their heads down in the late 1980s and early 1990s, fearing financial reprisals from a cutting government. They had been wrong. </p> <p>\"We now know the dangers of keeping silent,\" the journal said. \"Of course the main victims are those whose lives have been tragically cut short by a horrific disease. But science, too, has suffered. With ministers having consistently claimed that they were following the best scientific advice, even while subtly misrepresenting its message, scientists have come to be seen by the public as part of the problem. It will take much work to regain public trust.\" </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.bse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bsereview.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Food Standards Agency BSE Review</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">MAFF BSE site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cjd\" target=\"_NEW\">Department of Health BSE/CJD site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.humanbse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Human BSE Foundation - voluntary support group</a><br> <a href=\"http://sparc.airtime.co.uk/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE news and research</a></p>",
  "<p>Hackers have broken into Microsoft's computer network and gained access to blueprints of its latest software, the company admitted yesterday. Initial investigations suggest that the hackers could have links with, or be based in, St Petersburg, Russia. </p> <p>Microsoft, already embroiled in a legal battle with the US government, said it is working with the FBI and law enforcement authorities to trace the source of \"a deplorable act of computer espionage\". </p> <p>Steve Ballmer, the chief executive, confirmed that hackers gained access to the source codes - which include the software for products such as the Windows operating system - but insisted they had not tampered with them. </p> <p>\"They did in fact access the source codes,\" Mr Ballmer said during a meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. \"You bet this is an issue of great importance.

The break-in also raises fears of a \"mole\" within Microsoft. </p> <p>Members of Microsoft's security team apparently found that passwords used to transfer the source code behind Microsoft's software were being sent from the company's computer network headquarters in Redmond, Washington state, to an email address in St Petersburg. </p> <p>The hackers are believed to have had access to the company's software codes for as long as three months.</p>",
  "<p>Internet start-ups are seen as synonymous with youth, with men and women fresh out of business school - or even school - using the web to bypass the traditional hierarchy of the office and become instant senior managers. </p> <p>But a report issued by the Industrial Society this month says that dot.coms are realising that they need older, more experienced workers once they have launched to take the business from infancy into maturity. </p> <p>The report, Experience Necessary - the Business Case for Wisdom, has dubbed the type of older business people most in demand as \"warhorses\"; seasoned campaigners with experience of previous economic cycles who are not scared by downturns. Older people also bring the weight of experi ence, which leads to increased customer confidence, and well-honed networking skills. </p> <p>The report points in particular to the Asian market, where \"veneration and respect for age are important, and counterparts find it more comfortable to build relationships with older business people rather than with young dot.com entrepreneurs\". </p> <p>The view that having a few wrinkles are important in business was supported last week by the British Venture Capitalists Association, whose members underwrite scores of dot.com start-ups with hard cash. The association's chairman, David Thorp, decried the lack of wise heads watching the finances. </p> <p>\"The reason why the early dot.coms seemed to succeed was because they had no bag gage. Everyone was looking with fresh eyes and they went for it; the internet meant that barriers to entry were low and they had speed and verve. But what they did not have was business knowledge, and what we are now seeing is some of the more trusted business skills being integrated into new internet solutions.\" He adds that most venture capitalists avoided early dot.coms precisely because of their lack of business experience. </p> <p>This month saw the first high-profile signing of an older business star by his younger peers. Allan Leighton, 47, former chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Europe and Asda before that, is joining the board of lastminute.com. He will not be paid, but is receiving 1m share options for his role as non-executive chairman. </p> <p>Martha Lane Fox, the 27- year-old chief operating officer of lastminute says: \"We are thrilled that someone with Allan's track record of leadership in customer-focused businesses is joining us. Allan is someone we have respected for some time. As we talked to him about our vision it soon became clear that he would be extremely valuable in helping us to provide an even better service for our customers.\" </p> <p>Ronald Cohen, of venture capitalists Apax Partners, agrees that dot.coms are waking up to the value of experience. \"Young entrepreneurs are coming in and asking for experienced people; increasingly they are realising that they need this to get the business to the stock markets.\" </p> <p>And Charlotte Thorne, author of the Industrial Society report, says: \"The current requirement is for knowledge. Businesses need people who can employ their experience and understanding, their networks and their strategic vision to add value to organisations.\" She makes the point that businesses set up by entrepreneurs in their early 50s are twice as likely to survive as those started by people aged 20-25 and that by 2020 one in four of the workforce will be aged 50 or above. </p> <p>But are those who are bricks and mortar worldly wise readily able to transfer their skills to the virtual realm? </p> <p>Graham Woolley, aged 54, had spent most of his working life as a management consultant until he went into semi-retirement last year. His CV boasts that he has been director of business solutions at CGNU Insurance, and has also been principal of PricewaterhouseCoopers' management consultancy di vision - and that his skills and experience include analysing problems and issues, creating and implementing original solutions and organising third-party suppliers. </p> <p>He is now acting as a consultant to FashionNightmare.com, a website which aims to stimulate, educate, entertain and empower female teenagers, launched later this month. </p> <p>\"I was running a project employing Kath's (Kathleen Nickels, founder of FashionNightmare) husband. He said that he thought I was just the kind of person who could help the company get off the ground and I was interested in getting involved in a project. To date I have mainly been involved in forward planning and making sure that services are delivered. </p> <p>\"It's a kind of 'sorting out any messes' role - before me, Kath went to family and friends to try to get issues sorted out, but it is what I have spent most of my career doing. The biggest issue so far for FashionNightmare has been that it has not had enough money.\" </p> <p>He is not being paid for his input, but has taken an equity share in the company instead: \"I have a much more personal stake than I would have if it was just a matter of investment,\" he says. </p> <p>The decision-making process is essentially the same as with a traditional style company, so his experience is directly relevant, and his years in the business world mean that he can play a smoothing role. </p> <p>Ms Nickels has found that the process of raising money, finding the right team, managing third-party suppliers and actually launching a website has been more torturous than she had expected, even with her strong business background. She says that taking on Mr Woolley was one of the best long-term moves she has made so far in her bid to launch the site. </p> <p>Although she has been a management consultant - with US group Marakon, working both in the States and the UK, and writing the business model should not have been a problem, she found herself proposing ideas which, as a consultant, she would have pooh-poohed. </p> <p>\"It's amazing, now that I'm on my own, how much self-doubt creeps in and how excited I am when someone thinks what I'm doing is a good idea. Also, I did not go to business school, which is where I think the majority of strong networks are built. </p> <p>\"When you start out there are plenty of cynics, the kind of people who have just got their MBA and need to prove that they know more about the internet than you. They just want to rain on your parade and you need to be able to spot that. </p> <p>\"But what you really need is people who know a lot and will be able to criticise, but their criticism will be constructive.\" </p> <p>She adds that Mr Woolley's involvement also encouraged backers. \"I had to tell my cousin, who had been helping me out, that her CV was not going to get us funding. It's definitely true that backers will go for an A team with a B idea but never a B team with an A idea. </p> <p>\"But it is a catch 22 situation - you can't get people without funding, but you can't get funding without the people there in the first place.\" </p> <p>But most important is the guiding hand of someone used to toughing out hard times in business: \"It has been a constantly changing dynamic, like a box of puzzle pieces which keep changing size. It is exhilarating when people promise money or support, but when that then fails to materialise quickly, or at all, the lows are really low. Having Graham around has helped me put it all into perspective.\" </p> <p>She would now offer two main pieces of advice to an internet startee: ensure that one of the first members of staff taken on is a technology expert: \"I tried to launch without this and failed. I now have a person who has 20 years' experience,\" she adds. </p> <p>Secondly, find a mentor and get them on board as a non-executive director. \"It helps to have contacts, but it is far more helpful to have advice and cheerleaders.\"</p> <p><strong>Windows of opportunity: why even Bill Gates may face an age-old problem in his 30s</strong> </p> <p>Ageism is rife in the IT sector despite huge skills shortages, says a new survey by the Employers' Forum on Age, writes Liz Stuart . Although 65% of the 1,400 IT professionals questioned said their company finds it difficult to recruit staff, more companies are refusing to take on older people, many of whom have the necessary skills. More than four in five thought the government should do more to stop ageism in the workplace. </p> <p>Sam Mercer, campaign director of the EFA, says the research also shows that 88% of people said mixed-aged teams work better than teams comprised solely of younger workers. \"The IT industry is particularly guilty of ageism. An article in a computer trade magazine said all employees over 50 should be sacked because they do not have the right skills, but our survey refutes that.</p> <p>\"The government's immigration initiative could help to close this skills gap but it's not enough on its own. If the government and IT industry are serious about addressing skills shortages they should work towards changing a culture undervaluing the contribution of employees as young as 35.\"</p> <p>The research also showed an alarming definition of the term \"older\": 21% thought an employee is an older worker by the age of 35, which would put Bill Gates in this category.</p>",
  "Even as Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, and health minister Alan Milburn were preparing to make their apologies for the failures of successive governments in getting to grips with BSE and its nightmare human form, revealed in the devastating Phillips report into the catastrophe on Thursday, more bad news was being passed on to their officials. <p>Investigations into the death of a 74-year-old man last year had concluded that he, too, was a victim of vCJD - news that could lead to a fundamental reassessment of the disease. </p> <p>No wonder then that Mr Brown announced that the government was already \"commissioning an independent assessment of current scientific understanding of the disease, including emerging findings, on the origins of the BSE epidemic\". </p> <p>Behind that flat matter-of-fact announcement was a worrying realisation that the Phillips inquiry belief that BSE could have been in cows since the early 1970s - at least three cycles of the infection before it burst in its full horror on to Britain's dairy farms - would mean scientists would have to think yet again about all the potential risks to human health. </p> <p><b> Vaccine</b><br> </p> <p>Volume eight of the 16-volume report advises the government it may have to check all vaccines made during the 1970s. Bovine material sourced from Britain in the 1980s is now banned but previous, allegedly inadequate checks by medicine control officials between 1988 and 1992 failed to establish the source of bovine ingredients used in the 1970s to develop the master stocks of batches that could have remained in circulation for years. </p> <p>Now, said Phillips, \"batches of vaccines manufactured during the 1970s cannot therefore be ruled out as a source of infection merely because of their date of manufacture. Patients with vCJD born before 1960 are unlikely to have been infected by childhood vaccination, but the possibility of infection by vaccination in adulthood may merit consideration.\" </p> <p>The Phillips team, of course, did not know of the 74-year-old. Now people are wondering just how exposed people were to eating infected meat in the 1970s - long before there were any control mea sures to combat the hidden BSE that can exist in infected cattle well in advance of when they display the classic \"mad\" signs. </p> <p>Lord Phillips has made clear that however quickly the government had reacted to the cattle epidemic in the 1980s - and it was sometimes painfully slow - it could not have stopped thousands of diseased and infectious cows entering the food chain and infecting unknown members of the population. </p> <p><b> Iceberg</b><br> </p> <p>That situation is still far from clear in the population. Is this old man just an unusual aberration in the normal profile of vCJD victims? One of the first reasons early cases of the disease came to attention was their relative youth compared to other sufferers of debilitating and fatal neurological conditions. </p> <p>Analysis of the ages of the first 77 deaths revealed earlier this month indicates that since 1995, a dozen teenagers have succumbed, three dozen aged between 20 and 29, about 20 between 30 and 39, and about 10 others up to the age of 54. The assumption until now has been they were exposed to poisoned bovine material as the epidemic in cattle began to spiral, perhaps between 1984 and 1989. That would suggest relatively short incubation periods for some, around 10 years. </p> <p>Zoe Williams, still alive at 14, but a known victim of vCJD at 12, would have been just four when the main anti-BSE measures were introduced. </p> <p>Yet such vCJD-like diseases can have incubation periods running to 25 or even 35 years. Just suppose the new victim was exposed to BSE in the mid-1970s. But would he be the herald of a new \"iceberg\" or was he just unlucky? </p> <p>The truth is that no-one yet knows. So much about the disease is still a mystery despite the huge advances of recent years. No-one knows what the level of an infective \"dose\" is for a human - BSE-infected material the size of a peppercorn was enough for big cows - or the length of incubation; whether genetic make-up makes people more susceptible (all confirmed cases so far have been from the same group that makes up just under 40% of the population) and whether other factors such as youth, illness, sores or even new teeth increase the risk. </p> <p>The Phillips team also recommends further investigation of the consumption of cheap beefburgers and other meat products made from mechanically recovered meat which, unlike other risky parts of cows, was not banned until 1995. These are now among prime candidates for carrying infectivity, even if no-one knows how much. </p> <p>Now, the potential exposure to infected meat spreads more than 20 years - from the mid-1970s and mid-1990s. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.bse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bsereview.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Food Standards Agency BSE Review</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">MAFF BSE site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cjd\" target=\"_NEW\">Department of Health BSE/CJD site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.humanbse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Human BSE Foundation - voluntary support group</a><br> <a href=\"http://sparc.airtime.co.uk/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE news and research</a></p>",
  "America's most powerful politician will not be elected next month. For those on the receiving end of US foreign policy, at least, that person, arguably, is Jesse Helms. The hawkish Republican senator from North Carolina is well into his fifth, six-year term. He does not face re-election until 2002. In the meantime, he continues as chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee which, in concert with Congress as a whole, holds the purse strings and has oversight of almost every aspect of US global diplomacy. Nor is Mr Helms at all bashful about exercising his considerable powers or advancing his trenchant opinions. <p>In the past few weeks alone, Mr Helms has denounced Yasser Arafat as a \"terrorist\"; dismissed Iranian reform efforts as \"hogwash\"; described Fidel Castro as a \"deadbeat\" and \"swindler\"; condemned normalised trade relations with \"communist China\"; ridiculed the \"sorry performance\" of UN peacekeepers in Sierra Leone; blasted the Clinton administration for \"inexcusable\" delays in building a national missile defence system; and hammered away at the old enemy, Russia. </p> <p>Thanks in no small measure to Mr Helms, the US has in recent years defaulted on its UN dues, tried to block the planned international criminal court, failed to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty, been slow to deploy ground troops in both Bosnia and Kosovo (and whinged about it ever since), imposed sanctions on dozens of countries it dislikes, pursued a fruitless, destructive vendetta against Iraq and swung, ideologically speaking, towards an ever more overweening unilateralism. </p> <p>All this goes down a treat in rightwing circles at home. When George W Bush talks of pulling troops out of the Balkans, Mr Helms's influence is at work. Some foreigners are impressed, too. Lithuania recently gave him the illustrious Medal of Grand Duke Gediminas to add to his two Senate Golden Gavels and his US police federation Golden Eagle Award. All the same, it really is time that Mr Helms, aged 79, slowed down a bit.</p> <p>Luckily, an opportunity is at hand. If the Democrats can gain five seats on November 7, they will retake control of the Senate and Mr Helms will lose his chairmanship. They may also win the House of Representatives. There are many reasons for wishing the Democrats success in the congressional elections. But for vote-less foreigners, the reactionary, Blimp-ish Mr Helms is the most pressing.</p>",
  "A mother cried out in grief and rage as the man accused of poisoning her daughter with sulphuric acid walked free from Birmingham crown court yesterday. <p>The family of Karenina Longe, 27, who died on February 6 last year after drinking drain cleaner, remained composed as the jury cleared her former partner Andrew Gardner, 41, of murder after more than two days of deliberation. </p> <p>But when the four women and eight men gave their second verdict \"not guilty of manslaughter\" an hour later, Carole Longe screamed from the public gallery: \"There is no justice here. Where's the justice? It's nonsense. It's absolutely farcical.\" </p> <p>Mr Gardner, a former laboratory technician, was accused of poisoning Dr Longe at the home they had shared in Sheldon, Birmingham because he was angry that she had ended their five-year relationship. </p> <p>He initially claimed that she had drunk the acid accidentally, but later insisted to police that she had deliberately harmed herself because she was under stress. </p> <p>Dr Longe drank the Liquid Plumber while visiting Mr Gardner and died the next day in Heartlands hospital, where she worked as a senior house officer. She would have suffered the \"torments of hell\" as acid burned through her stomach and \"cooked\" her organs, Stephen Linehan QC, prosecuting, had told the court. </p> <p>He alleged that Mr Gardner had somehow tricked her into drinking the liquid. There was no sign that she had been forced to drink it. </p> <p>Mr Gardner waited 23 minutes before calling an ambulance, telephoning plumbers for advice instead. When he finally called the emergency services Dr Longe's agonised screams could be heard in the background. </p> <p>After telling paramedics that it was an accident, he sent his teenage son in the ambulance and went drinking in local pubs. He briefly visited the hospital later that day but fled to London after learning Dr Longe would die, using her cashcard to spend \u00a3800 on drink and nightclubs. </p> <p>Three weeks later, after police appeals, he handed himself in, claiming to have taken an overdose of paracetamol. Doctors who examined him said it was a lie. </p> <p>Mr Linehan told the court that Mr Gardner had \"lied, lied and lied again\" in his accounts. Even his own defence team described him as a liar and womaniser with a drink problem. </p> <p>He did not give evidence during the trial, but in interviews told the police that Dr Longe had deliberately harmed herself because of stress. His claim that she had drunk three-quarters of a bottle of vodka that morning was proved false by a post-mortem examination. </p> <p>Mr Gardner claimed he had not called an ambulance because he did not realise how serious the situation was and feared that a suicide attempt would damage Dr Longe's career. He said he had fled to London out of panic. </p> <p>The prosecution cast doubt on key parts of his story, such as his claim that Dr Longe had first complained of stomach pains while making love. </p> <p>The liquid she drank was more than 93% sulphuric acid and would have burned her instantly. Four weeks after her death it was still burning holes in her clothes. </p> <p>Mr Gardner lived in Zimbabwe until 1988, working on the farm of his wealthy parents after a brief spell fighting in the civil war, but moved to England after his stormy and violent marriage broke up. </p> <p>Mr Gardner met Dr Longe while both were working at St Bartholomew's hospital in London. He had a child with another woman and continued to to live with her until he followed Dr Longe to Birmingham in September 1998. </p> <p>But the relationship became strained as Mr Gardner failed to find a job and drank heavily. On the Monday before her death he hit her and kneed her in the stomach during an argument. She moved into hospital lodgings and told her mother the relationship was over. Mr Gardner denied this. </p> <p>Courtenay Griffiths QC, for the defence, told the jury: \"I'm not asking you to like this man, this alcoholic, this clear womaniser, this fickle individual, who left his 15-year-old boy to, in fact, clear up the mess, sponging off a stressed-out young female doctor. </p> <p>\"You've got good reason to dislike him. You may even feel he's responsible for her death. But responsibility for her death and guilt of her murder are two completely different things.\" </p> <p>In a statement Mr Gardner said he \"remains devastated by the suicide of Miss Longe. This prosecution was not based on hard evidence but on pandering to people's emotions. We are therefore grateful to the jury for preventing a miscarriage of justice.\" </p> <p>But family and friends refused to accept that the popular, high-achieving doctor could have committed suicide. </p> <p>Her mother said: \"We all know Nina Longe would not kill herself. Everybody who knew her knew she was a young woman who had everything to live for. </p> <p>\"She was very focused, very organised, but very compassionate. She was mature beyond her years and I think she would have gone on to realise her dream and lead a very full life.\" </p> <p>Dr Longe, born in Lagos, was sent to a boarding school in Yorkshire at 13. Her family have set up a bursary in her memory, helping young doctors to carry out research or train in Africa.</p>",

  "The planned sale of Britain's air traffic control system was cast into further doubt yesterday as rebel Labour MPs said they would continue to oppose it, spurred on by the government's defeat in the Lords on Thursday. <p>While the prime minister's spokesman insisted the government would overturn the defeat in the Commons, pressure mounted for the measures to be dropped to save the delayed transport bill. Crucial legislation governing the regulation of the railways may be lost if the bill is not passed before the Queen's speech on December 6. </p> <p>Yesterday, Gwyneth Dunwoody, the chairwoman of the Commons transport select committee, urged the government to drop the part-privatisation plan. \"They would be wise perhaps to accept this is not the time to go ahead with this plan,\" she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. </p> <p>\"There is a great deal of doubt ... and this will hold up the transport bill, which contains absolutely essential bits of legislation about railways. I don't think any sensible business manager is so wedded to a rather pointless idea that they want to put it ahead of everything else in their programme.\" </p> <p>The former transport minister, Gavin Strang, MP for Edinburgh East and Musselburgh, described the Lords vote as \"an important and significant defeat\" and said it provided the government with \"an opportunity to walk away from this privatisation with dignity\". He rejected ministers' claims that safety was the primary consideration. </p> <p>Martin Salter, Labour MP for Reading West and a former Heathrow baggage handler, warned that rebel MPs would continue to vote against the government - as 47 did the last time it was in the Commons - or abstain. He said the rail crisis would make MPs even more resolute. </p> <p>The government argues that putting 51% into private ownership would bring in \u00a31.3bn investment in the next decade and improve efficiency.

  "The last full day of Harish Purohit's life began with the Hindu priest in a Leicester city centre night club that draws a predominantly gay clientele. At around 2.15am on October 19 he was seen by an acquaintance leaving Streetlife. He got into his silver BMW 320i and drove off. After waking, the rest of his final hours were spent between his duties at the family's temple where he was based, the care home he co-owned and his job working for social services. <p>Just before 11pm he went to 79 Harrison Road, a house his family was renovating, to check on its progress. In the small terraced house he died after suffering 13 stab wounds. </p> <p>For the last week his family and the Hindu community have been trying to come to terms not only with his savage murder, but the fact that he was bisexual. </p> <p>The police investigation is reporting little progress, but detectives believe the motive may lie in Harish's links to Leicester's gay community. </p> <p>This week - the week of the largest Hindu festival, Diwali - should have been one of joy for the Purohits. Instead, at the Shree Shakti Mandir, a steady stream of mourners call into the temple founded and run by Harish's father, who brought his son up to be a priest. </p> <p>Jai Purohit, 35, and Janardan Purohit, 46, are not only mourning their 42-year-old brother, but a man who had modernised the role and style of the Hindu priesthood in Britain. Those who had seen Harish conducting ceremonies did not forget him. </p> <p>Five years ago I went to the Shree Shakti Mandir for the marriage of my uncle and aunt, conducted by Harish. What he did was very simple, but for the Hindu priesthood near revolutionary; he spoke in English, and explained to non-Hindus and those with a shaky grasp of their culture, each part of the wedding ceremony and its significance. </p> <p>Harish told us: \"Hinduism is not a religion, it's a way of life, a way of thinking, a way of disciplining oneself, physically, spiritually and emotionally. </p> <p>\"The word religion has been attached because there isn't any equivalent word to the Hindu Dharma in the Oxford dictionary, so the nearest thing to dharma [in English] is religion.\" </p> <p>Most Hindu priests in this country are elderly and perform ceremonies in Hindi, catering for an audience born and raised in India, for whom the culture and rituals are part of the warp and weft of their lives. </p> <p><b> Compassion</b><br> </p> <p> \"People loved him for the way he delivered his services. He was more casual, more sociable,\" remembers Jai. </p> <p>\"He felt that the Hindu priesthood was not delivering enough to the younger generation, he believed there was work needed so that the younger generation would know their heritage.\" </p> <p>Harish's brothers tell the story of how six months ago he saw a group of refugees on the street while out driving. He went home, made curry, then went to the local shop and bought its entire stock of milk and bread, grabbed a bag of clothes, and took it to the refugees. </p> <p>Within the religion he was a progressive, while in wider society he fought to protect Hinduism. He lifted a bar on widows participating in rituals at wedding ceremonies and took people with learning disabilities to functions and ceremonies. </p> <p>Those closest to Harish speak of his love, compassion and belief in everyone's equal rights. Nothing they knew of him suggests why he was murdered. </p> <p>His body was discovered after a neighbour rang the Purohits to say there was smoke coming from the property. Jai and his father rushed to the house. </p> <p>Jai said: \"I saw smoke and I saw the body on the floor. When I saw the jumper I knew it was my brother, he was face down on his side. I tried to resuscitate him, but couldn't open his mouth because of rigor mortis.\" He had been repeatedly stabbed, the final wound inflicted close to the front door which the attackers blocked with a sofa before they set fire to the house. </p> <p>Yesterday police said they wanted to question five Asian men in their thirties seen leaving an alley at the back of the house at 3.30am on October 20. </p> <p>\"Obviously somebody didn't like the work he did,\" says Janardan. \"The motive is obviously jealousy of the work he was doing.\" </p> <p>His brothers say they did not know Harish was bisexual, a fact confirmed to the Guardian by his long term partner, solicitor Anjana Joshi, and by another close friend. </p> <p>Police had said Harish led a double life, but as he was known in several gay clubs and pubs across Leicester, he does not appear to have been trying hard to keep it a secret. </p> <p>Harish's marriage broke down 1992 after a year. He and Ms Joshi did not marry and lived apart. </p> <p>She said: \"He was a truly godly person. He took away the darkness and brought in the light wherever he was.\" </p> <p>She told the Leicester Mercury: \"I knew he was bisexual and didn't have a problem with it. My love is unconditional.\" </p> <p>Ray McClaghlan was a friend of Harish's for 17 years and they jointly ran a residential care home for people with learning disabilities. He said: \"It's not fair to say he led a double life, that suggests hypocrisy. He led a life that was at one with his beliefs.\" </p> <p>Not all in Leicester's Hindu community are comfortable with the details of Harish's private life emerging. </p> <p>Jagdish Bhatt, secretary of the federation of Hindu priests of which Harish was a leading figure, said Harish was \"a very good man\" but criticised his homosexual conduct. </p> <p><b> Inspirational</b><br> </p> <p>Rajendrabhai Chauhan, of the Gujarat Hindu Association, said: \"It is something, in the Hindu community, that nobody expected. [Hinduism] is hierarchical. The priest is the highest. Everyone looks up to them. What they do does matter to the community.\" </p> <p>Those who followed the development of Harish's Hindu philosophy and style as a priest feel his best was yet to come. Hinduism, Britain's third largest religion, is grappling with the challenge of keeping its young interested. He was one of the few leading Hindu figures making much progress. </p> <p>Sumeer Kalyani, 21, president of the city's federation of Hindu youth, said Harish had a special appeal to young people: \"He was an inspiration to the younger generation of Hindus. A lot of people looked up to him because he was so knowledgeable, but took the time to explain any aspect of Hinduism. </p> <p>\"Harish bridged that gap between old and young Hindus. Sometimes it was like a one man show in Leicester, he didn't get the support.\"</p>",
  "Kosovo will take a step closer to a final break with Yugoslavia when it holds its first democratic elections today. <p>The pro-independence Kosovan Albanian parties will sweep the board in the polling for municipal authorities, which will be almost totally boycotted by the few remaining Serbs. </p> <p>Thousands of peacekeeeping troops will guard the 1,464 polling stations to prevent trouble. In an effort to minimise intimidation and corruption, more than 1,000 European monitors have been drafted in to support 3,000 local observers. </p> <p>The Kosovo Albanians' overwhelming support for independence is a problem for the US, Britain and other Nato members, which are hoping for a reconciliation between Kosovo and the newly elected government in Belgrade. The west is afraid that any further fragmentation in the Balkans will create instability. </p> <p>Hashim Thaci, the former leader of the Kosovan Liberation Army (KLA), who now heads the PDK (Democratic Party of Kosovo), said at a rally in the capital, Pristina, on Thursday: \"On Saturday, it is up to you to give an answer to the dilemma of the final status of Kosovo ... your vote will put an end to the Serb dream of returning to Kosovo.\" </p> <p>The more moderate Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of the LDK (Democratic League of Kosovo), who is likely to emerge with the biggest share of the votes, also stressed that the only solution to the Kosovan problem was a speedy move towards independence. He called for today's poll to be followed quickly by elections for an assembly and president - de facto independence. </p> <p>Richard Holbrooke, the US special envoy, said such elections would be held soon, but a UN spokeswoman said it was too early to say if they would be held in the spring. </p> <p>Despite the replacement of the hated Slobodan Milosevic as president of Yugoslavia by the more conciliatory Vojislav Kostunica, who called this week for the poll to be postponed, the demand for independence has increased. </p> <p>Party political broadcasts have been unequivocal, showing footage of fleeing refugees and Serbian police entering Kosovo Albanian villages, a reminder of the events that led to Nato's intervention last year. </p> <p>Kosovo is still recovering from that war: many buildings in Pristina are still wrecked from the Nato bombing, there are frequent power cuts, the roads are pitted and communication is irregular. </p> <p>The biggest problem remains lawlessness in a country with one of the highest concentrations of guns in the world. The judicial system is biased against Serbs; crime and corruption are endemic. </p> <p>The PDK, which has many members who fought in the KLA, and close links with organised crime, has control of many towns and villages. The UN is braced for bloodshed if it refuses to hand over control of any municipalities it looses.\"The behaviour of the PDK is the big question,\" a western diplomat in Pristina said. </p> <p>The run-up to the election has been relatively peaceful by Kosovan standards. There was a grenade attack on Thursday, and a suspected incident of arson. Earlier in the week there was a power cut as Mr Rugova rose to deliver a speech at a rally. One of the main causes of tension is the Kosovo Albanian flag. The UN said it could not be shown at polling stations. </p> <p>Almost a million Kosovo Albanians have registered to vote, and about 1,000 Serbs. In one exclusively Serb area, Zvecan, only 23 people - all Serbs - have registered to vote in 17 wards. To try to circumvent the boycott the UN administrator in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, will appoint Serbs to some municipalities. </p> <p>There are no reliable opinion polls but Mr Rugova's LDK is forecast to emerge as the biggest party, Mr Thaci's PDK second and Ramush Haradinaj's AAK (Alliance for the Future of Kosovo), also pro-independence, third. </p> <p>There is little difference between their programmes, most of the debate focusing on their roles in the past 10 years: Mr Thaci argues that his military option was more successful than Mr Rugova's passive resistance.</p>",
  "A US judge has jailed for 12 years a British grandmother who hijacked a helicopter in an attempt to free her husband, a convicted murderer, from a top security prison. <p>Josie Clark, 54, originally from Keighley, West Yorkshire, and latterly from the Isle of Wight, and a woman accomplice chartered the helicopter last December.</p> <p>Once aboard, she drew a gun and ordered the pilot to fly to the Union correctional institution at Raiford, Florida, where her husband, Ronald, was on death row after being sentenced to death for killing a man in 1991. He had been sentenced to life for an earlier murder in 1989. Her friend, Wendy Calderon, 30, wanted to free her boyfriend.</p> <p>The two women forced the helicopter pilot to turn back once they were in sight of the jail and were arrested as they tried to make their escape. Both later pleaded guilty to hijacking an aircraft.</p> <p>Calderon was jailed for 11 years and three months last month and yesterday Judge Henry Lee Adams passed sentence on Clark. \"This offence is unusual in any circumstance outside of a movie,\" he said. He also ordered Clark to pay a helicopter charter fee of \u00a33,700.</p> <p>Judge Adams said he did not give Clark the maximum 20-year sentence because she had attempted to free her husband after he was threatened by another death row prisoner, identified in court records only as Costa. She had been reluctant to cooperate with the plan and had no criminal record.</p> <p>Clark met Ronald, her second husband, through a pen friends magazine; she had previously been married in England for 24 years, where she has four children.

  "<p>The Italian government and executives at BT were left red-faced this week by the collapse of the Blu consortium's bid for a third-generation mobile phone licence. Governments typically lack commercial nous; corporations, on the other hand, are often highly adept at politics. Politicians need to learn the lessons of the commercial jungle if they are ever to gain the upper hand in the state-enterprise struggle. </p> <p>Dazzled by the windfalls accruing to the British and German state finances, the Italian government chose an auction process in an attempt to maximise revenues from the sale of licences for third-generation mobile operation. In a lather of excitement about the business to be gained from 3G technology, such as the market in text messaging, the telecoms groups collectively bid \u00a322.5bn for the five UK licences. In Germany the bids totalled a third as much again. </p> <p>I admit to being something of a luddite. The only text message I have received on my mobile came from BT Cellnet, offering me, as a \"valued customer\", a free handset upgrade. Needless to say I took them up on this no-strings offer - primarily because I could not understand how it represented good business. </p> <p>Even allowing for my reactionary response to new technology, I cannot see the text-to-mobile or mobile internet revolution justifying the valuations placed on 3G licences: \u00a322.5bn represents around \u00a3380 for every man, woman, child and baby in Britain - and that is before taking into account the cost of operating a network. It is telling that the heaviest users of text messaging are school children - they understand that a message can be sent at a fraction of the cost of a voice call. </p> <p>The UK licence auction raised five times original estimates. The chancellor - already perched on a healthy public purse - has refused to be seduced by unsolicited suggestions regarding spending this windfall. </p> <p>The Italians, by contrast, have a public debt mountain that must be dramatically reduced - at least if the Maastricht criteria are to be taken seriously. It has always been clear what Italy intended to do with its 3G licence fees. </p> <p>What the Italians failed to allow for was the ability of the potential bidders to learn from past experience. The British auction succeeded - from the government's perspective - because 13 bidders lined up at the outset for the five licences, and because none of the participants had any experience. In the intervening months investors and analysts have questioned the wisdom behind the prices paid for licences. Balance sheets have become stretched. Telecoms share prices have tumbled, reducing the ability of successful bidders to restructure their finances. The game, in short, has changed. </p> <p>Only six bidders lined up for the Italian auction of five licences. One of those, Blu, was an uneasy consortium led by motorway operator Autostrade, with our own BT as a minority shareholder but majority provider of telecoms expertise. The same BT, it should be said, whose share price has halved, the market questioning its strategy and taking fright at its projected \u00a330bn debt burden. </p> <p>Two days into the auction and it was effectively all over. The Blu consortium folded its hand, choosing instead to indulge in an unseemly round of mutual recriminations. The Italian government was left with five bidders for five licences, raising a total of only \u00a38bn, or around half the government's publicly stated expectation. That is about \u00a3140 per head of Europe's most mobile-enthusiastic population - and only 35% of the UK take. </p> <p>Whatever governments throw at them, companies invariably find ways of maximising commercial opportunities. Italy's government may rail at Blu - withholding its auction deposit in the process - but the ragbag consortium was merely the proximate cause of what has become a political crisis. </p> <p>The real issue was that the telecoms groups discovered that by forming alliances to bid for licences they could shift the balance of power in the auction process away from the vendor. Hence the reduced number of runners at the start. </p> <p>It is not just new industries that present governments with such problems of control and commercial exploitation. Britain's rail industry has a structure that was designed by government to maximise service to customers and returns to taxpayers. In the depth of the industry's present crisis this structure is the subject of intense scrutiny - as is its core philosophy of private ownership but public regulation. </p> <p>The history of state ownership in rail, as in many other industries, is one of commercial failure. However, privatisation carries the risk that a commercial business focus undermines public service; in the case of rail, not only in safety but also in breadth of service and return to the exchequer. Government faces the dilemma of juggling service and return. Higher licence or franchise fees reduce financial returns - which must tempt commercial organisations to make economies on service quality. </p> <p>There is a spectrum of industries to which these privatisation and regulation issues can be applied. At one end there is mobile telephony, in which few would blame governments for seeking to maximise revenue generation and caring little about service quality. If licence holders cannot provide the right service, market forces will resolve the problem. There will be failures, takeovers, higher charges to customers - or some combination of these three. </p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, how ever, are the \"backbone\" industries critical to the functioning of society in its modern form. Here, service will be of paramount importance. These industries will often also be natural monopolies, making any privatisation process particularly tricky. That is not to say competition cannot be achieved, as demonstrated by the growing number of companies offering domestic gas supplies. </p> <p>It is difficult, however, to envisage a break-up of the monopoly of air traffic control - and yet here is an industry close to privatisation in the UK. I am not a nervous flyer, but it is never too late to begin being so. Frankly, in this case I am a passenger first and a taxpayer second. I do not care a jot if nobody ever makes a profit out of a safe landing. </p> <p>\u0095 Edmond Warner is chief executive of Old Mutual Securities.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk\">edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk</a></p>",

  "Aunt Elspeth has had a phone call from her errant son Alistair in Western Australia. \"He says I've got to go and live with him, dearrr, and I don't want to! He says I'm being a burrrden to you! He says that I'll love the kookaburrrrrras ! But I can't get interrrested in kookaburrrrrras at my age! I want thrrrushes and blackbirrrds to sing overrr my grrrave !\" <p>Try to encourage Aunt Elspeth away from thoughts of graves. Anyway, with the decline of British bird life, soon the only thing that will tweet over anybody's grave is a cellphone. Assure Aunt that she is independent and can do what she likes. \"He's going to forrrce me down therrre !\" she mutters fearfully. \"He's just like his fatherrr - won't listen!\" Aunt goes off into her room and broods. My heart bleeds for the poor old thing. Just the words, \"long-haul flight to Australia\" make me want to lie down - and she's half-a-century older than me. </p> <p>\"Mum?\" Harriet appears at my elbow. \"Can I have 50 quid for a pair of Doc Martens? I'll pay you back 'n' everything. You've always said they were sensible shoes, right? I can wear them to school and, like, run fast away from pervy men or even kick them in the balls more easily.\" I may have been overdoing the \"men's minds are sinks of filth\" a bit recently. Although ... perhaps not. </p> <p>Uneasily aware that our overdraft has reached four figures, but shell out another 50, anyway. I would rather Harriet strode than teetered any day. </p> <p>\"Cheers, Mum, you're brilliant!\" She kisses me and runs off on shoes that are really quite adequate, and fairly new, as well. </p> <p>I turn to the internet to do a search on Perth. My notions of Western Australia are fairly primitive. Somehow, I think of convicts shooting it out in a desert of red sand, but I expect that's not the whole story. \"Premier Opens New Bunbury Playground For All Ages\". Quite sweet, really. \"Premier Opens Kings Park Wildflower Festival\". Does this guy never get tough with taxes, or does he just frolic about all day saying, \"Hello clouds, hello sky?\" \"Meerkat Triplets For Perth Zoo\". Meerkat triplets? Never mind Aunt Elspeth, I'm going there myself! Right now! \"Victorian Deer Park Will Not Affect Acacia Prison\". Bloody hell! Even the prisons have flowery names! I don't just want to go there - I want to offend there! I want to be banged up in Croci! </p> <p>Aunt comes out of her room looking pale. \"I've found some lovely stuff about Perth on the internet, Auntie,\" I smile.

He's just afterrr my money.\" </p> <p>Express incredulity, even though we both know that would be Just Like Alistair. </p> <p>\"Sit down with me for a moment, dearrr , if you will.\" Aunt has become strangely authoritative. \" Alistairrr doesn't know how much I've got.\" Try not to boggle visibly. \"But the fact is, he's ignorrred me forrr yearrrs .

We have a little cuddle, almost like Dot and Ethel on EastEnders - although, of course, I am a lot less smartly dressed than Dot. And I thought nobody loved me! Dearest Auld Aunt! Assure her I will care for her to the end. \"No, no, Dulcie, I wouldn't like you to have to deal with my bedpans,\" she insists, and walks, with great dignity, back to her room, leaving me staring at the envelope. </p> <p>Ex-spouse comes in, shakes the rain off his coat, and glimpses the envelope. \"Post been, then?\" he asks. \"Is that for me?\"</p>",
  "<p>Countries with a Pacific coastline produce some of the most provocative wines in the world. Even Thailand knocks out a couple of reasonable tipples: <strong> Chatemp Blanc 2541 Summer Harvest</strong> and <strong> Chatemp Rouge 2541 Summer Harvest</strong>. They are made by a Frenchman, Laurent Metge-Toppin, from vineyards so fecund that they produce two crops a year. They rate 13 points out of 20, and you can find them in Thai restaurants and some London stockists - namely, Gerry's in Old Compton Street, W1, Queen's Club Wines in W14, and Whistlestop Food &amp; Wine at various large railway termini - for between \u00a36.99 and \u00a39.95. </p> <p>Mexico doesn't sound up to much at first, either, but LA Cetto in Baja California, has consistently produced blisteringly fruity reds and the current one in form is the <strong> 1997 Petite Sirah </strong> (17 points, \u00a34.99): it has hugely individual fruit, is slightly spicy and richly succulent, and has fantastically alert tannins. This exceptional wine is available at Somerfield and Waitrose. </p> <p>Don't scoff: remember, Australia was once as little regarded as Mexico, yet we now have an abundance of its wines to dazzle our palates. <strong> Wynns Coonawarra Shiraz 1997</strong> (16.5 points, Budgens, \u00a36.99) is an invigorating mouthful of high-class fruit. The mineral tanginess is delicious, but what impresses most is the way the fruit spreads itself over the tongue, revealing dry, rich nuances from superb tannins. <strong> Peter Lehmann The Barossa Shiraz 1998</strong> (17 points, Oddbins, Safeway, Waitrose, \u00a36.99) is possibly the most vibrant Shiraz for the money on the market: dry, elegant, deep, beautifully textured. <strong> Woolshed Cabernet/Shiraz/Merlot Coonawarra 1998</strong> (17 points, Safeway, \u00a35.99) has stunning richness and textured fruit of huge depth and charm - a magnificently mouth-watering wine. <strong> Rosemount 'Hill Of Gold' Shiraz Mudgee 1998</strong> (17.5 points, Safeway, Waitrose, \u00a39.99) is a rarity: a Rosemount red with world-class tannins. It has beautifully well-knit fruit, offering a gripping experience. <strong> Voyager Estate Chardonnay 1997</strong> (17.5 points, Waitrose, \u00a310.99) is remarkably chewy, ripe, creamy and subtly vegetal. (Check the vintage, as the 1998 will be phased in soon and the rating applies to the 1997.) Even dear old Spar has a terrific Aussie white: the own-label <strong> Australian Semillon Chardonnay 1999</strong> (16 points, \u00a34.49), which has lovely, oily fruit: bold, thick, rich and purposeful. </p> <p>Two beautifully mature Aussie whites at Wine Rack and Bottoms Up are <strong> Michelton Viognier Rousanne 1997</strong> (17 points, \u00a312.99), which flaunts lovely oily fruit, and <strong> The Willows Vineyard Semillon 1996</strong> (17.5 points, \u00a38.49), which has a captivating, mellow, smoky richness and fine texture. </p> <p>Chile is now also a force on the UK market. <strong> Cono Sur Merlot 1999</strong> (16 points, Asda, Wine Cellar, \u00a34.49-\u00a34.99) has pliant, berried fruit with the texture of velvet. <strong> Santa Rita Triple C 1997</strong> (17 points, Majestic, \u00a310.99) is full of densely-packed, gently savoury plums, pears and apricots, plus leathery tannins.It performs like a crazed claret. </p> <p> <strong> Casa Lapostolle Cuv\u00e9e Alexandre Merlot 1998</strong> (17.5 points, Oddbins, \u00a313.99) is an immense construct, which, as the thoughtful taster gargles it around the molars, seems like some game sauce of quite unusual complexity: savoury, ripe, sweet, then dry to finish. <strong> Valdivieso Single Vineyard Merlot Reserve 1998</strong> (16.5 points, Safeway, \u00a38.99) inspired the tasting note, \"Heaven has arrived!\" and from such metaphysical nonsense you may deduce my overwhelming approval. <strong> Valdivieso Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve 1998</strong> (17 points, Tesco, \u00a36.99) offers coffee, cocoa, herbs, roast meat and lush tannins. It's a generous assembly of great richness. <strong> Caliterra Reserve Syrah 1999</strong> (16.5 points, Tesco, \u00a38.99) has gorgeous spice to its hedgerow fruits (plus plums), combined with savoury tannins to give it serious backbone. This is a wine of consummately well-textured class. <strong> Errazuriz Don Maximiano 1998</strong> (16 points, Tesco, \u00a317.99) requires deep digging in the pocket, but offers deep digging for the tastebuds, too, for it has cassis-edged fruit with superb tannins that give the wine power, concentration and a characterful yet polished personality. </p> <p>And last, from the Chilean neck of the woods, one great white wine: <strong> Casa Lapostolle Chardonnay 1998</strong> (17 points, Oddbins, Unwins, \u00a36.99). It is breathtakingly elegant, subtle, complex and immensely quaffable. It has undertones of ambrosia, and fills the ears with choirs of angels. </p> <p>New Zealand is most blessed by the maritime climate bequeathed by the Pacific, and this shows particularly clearly in the whites (bitingly fresh acids, limpid fruit). <strong> Villa Maria Reserve Clifford Bay Sauvignon Blanc 1999</strong> (16.5 points, Oddbins, \u00a39.99) has the typical grassy aroma leading to ripeness and concentration. <strong> Grove Mill Sauvignon Blanc 1999 </strong> (16.5 points, Safeway, Sainsbury, \u00a37.49) offers superbly clean fruit of compressed gooseberries and minerals. <strong> Villa Maria Private Bin Riesling 1999</strong> (16 points, Thresher, Victoria Wine, \u00a35.99) is young as yet, but deliciously drinkable - not like riesling as we know it from Europe, it has an ineffably exotic and subtle edge to its smooth acids, which will develop more excitingly if cellared for the next eight years (it is also available at Waitrose, but is selling out fast). <strong> Villa Maria Lightly Oaked Chardonnay 1999</strong> (16 points, Thresher, Victoria Wine, \u00a36.99) is plump but not fat, lithe yet not thin, fruity yet not full - it has, then, the classic virtues of the old world along with the purity of expression of the new. And <strong> Villa Maria Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 1999</strong> (16 points, Thresher, Victoria Wine, \u00a36.99) has great texture and warmth of welcome with a delicious, lively finish. </p> <p>On the Kiwi's red team, there is <strong> Te Mata Estate Cabernet Merlot 1998 </strong> (16.5 points, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up, \u00a38.49), which performs like a great novel, offering plot, character, wit and a great climax. </p> <p>California tells a different but no less involving story. <strong> Kautz-Ironstone Shiraz 1997</strong> (16 points, Majestic, \u00a35.99) is a very vibrant personality of meaty depth and resounding richness: not typically Californian or even Shiraz, but that's its charm. <strong> Fetzer Vineyards Select Zinfandel 1997 </strong> (16.5 points, Oddbins, \u00a37.99) is jammy, spicy, very ripe and awesomely delicious. <strong> Fetzer Sundial Chardonnay 1997</strong> (16 points, Unwins, \u00a35.49) is soft and slightly under-ripe, but gracious as it finishes. <strong> Stonybrook Chardonnay 1998 </strong> (16 points, Booths, \u00a34.99) has lovely plump, ripe fruit - a \"gorgeously demure melonosity\", my tasting notes proclaim. <strong> Bonterra Vineyards Merlot 1997</strong> (16.5 points, Waitrose, \u00a39.99) shows great organic class and polish, with outstanding tannins and acids to balance brilliantly dryly the lashings of sweet fruit. </p> <p>Indeed, if there is a theme to the fine wines from littorally Pacific lands, then this is it: balance. You can taste the cool oceanic nights in the wines from the best vintages. Such nights induce the grapes to produce acids to counter the daylight sugars, which the abundant sunshine guarantees</p>",
  "It's 3.30 on a Thursday afternoon, and I'm sitting in the dimly lit basement of Yo! Below in Soho. I'm here working my way through a line-up of flavoured sakes, which is not as cushy a number as you might think, not least because I'm trying to do so to the deafening background noise of Kim and Vee, the bartenders, practising their karaoke act. What's more, even the surprisingly proficient quality of Vee's singing doesn't quite compensate for the really weird flavours on offer - there's a rather cough-mixturish raspberry sake, a hazelnut one that tastes like pulverised Cadbury's Whole Nut and a gloopy, yeasty \"Pearl\" sake, which looks, er, like spunk, if truth be told. Vee tells me, when she finally pauses for breath, that she prefers the hot-house sake - \"It's good for my voice.\" Well, I wouldn't mind being able to sing as well as her, so that's a pretty strong recommendation. <p>At the moment, flavoured sakes are mainly restricted to Japanese-inspired bars such as Yo! Below, Itsu and Nobu, but wait a few months and you'll see them everywhere - if you don't believe me, remember what happened to flavoured vodkas a few years back. Of course, the Japanese wouldn't touch them with a bargepole, but that doesn't really matter as much as you might think, because they're unlikely to be offered any in a neighbourhood Tokyo bar - these sakes are made in Oregon, where fusion flavours reign supreme. </p> <p>Curiously, it's actually cheaper for a sake producer to set up shop in the US, because the cost of rice there is about a quarter of that in Japan. Unsurprisingly, then, seven of the top Japanese brewers now have production facilities in the country - there is even a sake garden in the Napa Valley. Sake's principle appeal for the health-obsessed American public is that it is low in sulphur and doesn't give you a hangover. So great is its potential, in fact, that Griffith Frost of Sak\u00e9One in Oregon predicts that before long one in five glasses of wine consumed in the US will be a sake - roughly the same figure it currently accounts for globally. </p> <p>Given sake's rather unappealing flavour - at least, to western palates - that might seem a rather implausible, not to say over-optimistic claim, but Ian Haffety of Sheffield-based Distinctive Drinks Company, which distributes the Momokawa range, similarly reckons that the public will rapidly come round to Japan's national tipple. \"People might think that sake is disgusting,\" he admits, \"but then, how many of them would drink vodka or tequila straight? Very few. In cocktails, however, they're the biggest-selling drinks on the market. </p> <p>\"Most people have come across sake only in Japanese restaurants, where it's often very poor quality and served hot,\" continues Haffety. \"But there are lots and lots of different sakes - sweet, dry, unfiltered, flavoured - and you can be as creative with sake as you can with other spirits.\" </p> <p>Cocktails currently being intrepidly promoted by Haffety's company include the vivid blue Tounami (silver sake, blue Cura\u00e7ao, Bombay Sapphire gin, orgeat syrup and milk), Japanese Bulldog (pearl sake, Kahlua, cream and Coca-Cola) and Black Sea (silver sake, Bombay Sapphire, lemon juice, gomme syrup and - God help us - squid ink). </p> <p>Sake is far from the only drink to have undergone a fusion makeover. The rather austere taste of green tea, for example, is being combined with other ingredients such as ginger and honey to make it more palatable to western consumers eager to take advantage of its much publicised health benefits (it's a powerful antioxidant). Tea drinks are particularly popular in south-east Asia. Kombucha, a recently launched fermented tea drink infused with yeast cultures and lactobacilli, apparently dates back to 221BC, when it was first brewed up for the Japanese emperor. \"Its overall effect - an extended feeling of health - cannot be fully explained,\" intones the label mysteriously. </p> <p>Health is also the core appeal of isotonic drinks such as Lipovitan and the bizarrely named Pochari Sweat, which apparently sells a billion cans a year in Japan. Available from many Japanese stores such as the Japan Centre in Piccadilly, it has rather an odd taste - a bit like a dose of liver salts. More palatable is Calpico, an odd, chalky-looking lactic acid drink, which tastes like a watery, lemon-flavoured yoghurt. </p> <p>However unfamiliar we may find these flavours (though remember just how quickly we've taken to sushi), the reality is that an oriental name is just about enough to sell anything these days, particularly in the countries of the Pacific Rim. Midori, for example, an ultra-sweet melon liqueur that was originally Japanese but that is now produced in Mexico, is apparently the fourth biggest-selling liqueur in Australia, while Illusion (Midori, Triple Sec, vodka, pineapple and lemon juice) is the top-selling cocktail. </p> <p>Bearing that in mind, the next bartender's must-have could well be Jinro Soju, a sort of Korean vodka, which is apparently one of the top five spirits brands in the world. </p> <p>The irony is, of course, that while the west pursues its love affair with the east, the east regards the west as the ultimate arbiter of taste. For the wealthy Japanese, it's all about malt whisky, Cognac and bottles of Petrus. And bugger the lactobacilli </p> <p><b> SIX SLICK PACIFIC DRINKS</b></p> <p><b>Hakutsuru Japanese Excellent Sake (\u00a38.39, Oddbins)</b><br> Just what it says - a pukka Japanese sake that tastes like a low-alcohol cross between a fino sherry, a grappa and an unoaked malt whisky. Perfect for sushi. Drink chilled (as you should any decent sake).</p> <p><b> Momokawa Ruby Sake (\u00a35.99 Waitrose)</b><br> This modern Oregon-brewed sake, rated Best US Sake in 1999, has a flavour halfway between dank and delicate, according to the rather bizarre graph on the back label. Nice, though, and I love the blue bottle.</p> <p><b> Ume Shu Japanese Plum Sake (\u00a315.90, Arigato, Brewer Street, London W1; The Japan Centre, Piccadilly, London W1; and other specialist oriental grocers) </b><br>Popular with mixologists, this genuinely plum-flavoured sake is actually very good on its own. It would also make a fantastic dessert wine.</p> <p> <b>Kombucha (\u00a31.55 for 250ml, Selfridges) </b><br>This plum-flavoured fermented tea drink is said to be a favourite of Barbra Streisand's, but don't let that put you off. </p> <p> <b>Arizona Asia Plum Green Tea with Ginseng (\u00a31.59, Waitrose) </b><br>Yet more plum, I'm afraid, but it's comparably the best fusion flavour, at least for drinks. A green tea drink in a stunning bottle that would be great to puton the table for teetotlers at a Chinese or Japanese meal.</p>",
  "My father. Where does he end and where do I begin? I seem to have spent my whole life chasing his shadow, trying to answer the questions that so many fathers pose to their sons. Is my life predetermined by his? My future defined by my past? Is his story repeating itself through me, or am I the author of my own fate? Is he my father, or am I his son? <p>He was hanged in Nigeria on November 10, 1995. On the morning of his execution, he was taken from his prison cell in a military camp in Port Harcourt, on the southern coast of Nigeria, and driven under armed escort to a nearby prison. It took five attempts to hang him. His corpse was dumped in an unmarked grave; acid was poured on his remains and soldiers posted outside the cemetery. </p> <p>Ken Saro-Wiwa's execution triggered a tidal wave of outrage that swept around the world. John Major, then British prime minister, described my father's execution as \"judicial murder\" and the military tribunal that sentenced him to death as a \"fraudulent trial, a bad verdict, an unjust sentence\". Nelson Mandela declared that \"this heinous act by the Nigerian authorities flies in the face of appeals by the world community for a stay of execution\". World figures, including Bill Clinton and the Queen, joined the worldwide condemnation of Nigeria's military dictator, General Sani Abacha. Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth; countries recalled their diplomats, and there were widespread calls for economic sanctions. There were candlelit vigils and demonstrations outside Nigerian embassies and at Shell Oil stations and offices. </p> <p>My father's death was front-page news around the world. Letters and tributes poured in from every continent, and Ken Saro-Wiwa was canonised in hastily prepared obituaries that were often littered with errors. A man whom few people had heard of 24 hours earlier was suddenly invested with a mythic quality, and his campaign against Shell Oil, and their mines on Ogoni lands, and a ruthless military regime was being touted as a morality tale for the late 20th century. </p> <p> </p> <p>I had a difficult and troubled relationship with my father, and although he was rarely around, I grew up in awe of him, intimidated by his achievements and haunted by the passions he stirred in both men and women. </p> <p>I never forgot the day he decided to let me in on the meaning of his and my life. We were driving around Port Harcourt and he was showing me around his business empire. Everything, he revealed, was for one purpose: to secure justice for our people. His books, the properties, the businesses - everything was subservient to his hopes and ambitions for our people. As we drove along the main road in the city, he outlined his vision of the future, and I sank lower and lower in the passenger seat. He was in the driving seat, his eyes firmly fixed on the road ahead, his horizons expanding as he outlined his vision. When he had mapped out my future, he glanced over and saw me looking grim-faced, my chin buried in my chest. </p> <p>\"You know you won't inherit my enemies,\" he said, trying to reassure me with a thin, unconvincing smile. </p> <p>I was 14 years old and I had no idea what he was talking about or which enemies he was referring to, but those words planted the notion in my mind that being Ken Saro-Wiwa's first son and namesake was a complicated and heavy burden. </p> <p>I would love to know what my father was thinking when he named me. My full name is Kenule Bornale Saro-Wiwa. It means \"In troubled times, I am fearless - the first son of Wiwa\". Perhaps my father took it as a good omen that, like him, his first son was born during a war. I sometimes imagine, in more cynical moments, that he looked into my eyes on November 28, 1968, and saw a reflection of himself. </p> <p>One of my earliest photographs shows me standing on a balcony, looking slightly surprised, a little unsteady on my feet. On the back of the photograph, my father has written, \"Kenule Bornale Tsaroti, first steps, aged seven months\". Since my father also walked at seven months, I imagine him staring at that photograph, beaming with pride, his pen poised to mark the milestone, excited at the thought that his first son and namesake is already following in his footsteps. </p> <p>At home I have always been known as Junior, but I was surprised when my father took me aside and told me, as we were preparing to leave for England, that my name was actually Kenule. I had never wondered why I was called Junior, but I loved the name because it made me stand out from all my friends, who had dull Nigerian names like Ibinabo, Nwachuwkwu or Dike. I was distinctly unimpressed by Kenule, and I told my father so. But he was adamant. Kenule was my name, and I was now to answer to it. </p> <p>England offered me refuge from the implications that being Ken Saro-Wiwa's son had in Nigeria, but it couldn't protect me from the complexities of being my father's son, especially after I became conscious of the fact that he was trying to mould me in his image. When he insisted that I follow his example and cut my hair, polish my shoes, iron my shirts, take pride and care in my appearance, I did the opposite. I resisted him, cutting off my nose to spite any traces of him in my face. But as long as he was paying my school fees, giving me the best opportunities in life, I couldn't rebel against him like my English friends did their fathers. I misspent my youth cautiously instead, nursing my resentment of my father's ambitions for me. </p> <p>My father could never understand why I was such an introspective, uncommunicative slouch around the house, especially when my school reports suggested I was \"outgoing\" and \"gregarious\". He started nosing around my life, invading my privacy, trying to understand what, if anything, was going on in my head. </p> <p>I once caught him reading my diary. He was standing by my bed, casually flicking through it. He didn't apologise, just carried on reading as if I wasn't there. I was livid, but I didn't protest: in our culture, as he was always quick to remind us, you never argue with your elders. I stopped writing the diary, but that didn't stop him from prying. He started opening every letter that was addressed to Ken Saro-Wiwa, even though it was not that difficult to work out which were his and which were mine. I retreated further into myself, slyly resisting the straitjacket of identity my father was trying to impose on me and dreaming of the day when I would take control of my life and change my name. </p> <p>I was 23 years old when I finally did it. I instructed a solicitor to draw up the documents, and in a lavish flourish of my new, shortened signature, I declared my independence from him and became Ken Wiwa. It wasn't the liberating experience I had hoped, though. Ken Wiwa seemed flat, rather unimpressive, especially next to the more colourful and flamboyant Ken Saro-Wiwa. </p> <p>It took me two years to break the news to my father. He was in detention by then, and when I wrote to him, I deliberately signed myself Ken Wiwa instead of Junior, as I had always done in the past. </p> <p>He was furious. </p> <p>He wrote back, complaining that \"nobody will ever know that you're my son\". At least that's how I used to tell the story. When I re-read the letter after he died, I saw that what he had actually written was a more anguished, \"there is no way in our culture that Ken Wiwa can be the son of Ken Saro-Wiwa\". </p> <p>Which, linguistically at least, is not true. </p> <p> </p> <p>One of the few times I ever stood up to my father was in Los Angeles in 1982. We were on holiday, travelling around the US. He had decided to take me and Gian, my younger brother, on a whirlwind, two-week sightseeing tour of six cities. \"I'm training you,\" he explained one day in Miami, after we protested that we couldn't survive on one meal a day. By the time we got to Los Angeles, we couldn't stand any more of his training regime, and we decided to mutiny. When he gave us some money and packed us off to Disneyland, we spent the whole day sunbathing and comparing fantasies of how we would kill him. We decided that when we returned to the hotel that evening, we would pointedly watch television instead of reading a book as he insisted we do every night. </p> <p>When the revolutionary moment came, I switched the television on, but Gian got cold feet and carried on reading. I was mortified but kept watching the television. I was wary of the silent, brooding figure lying on the bed behind me, however. \"My friend, turn that telly off and read your book,\" he bellowed. I picked up my book, flung it down in front of him and stormed off. I barricaded myself in the bathroom. And waited. And waited. After a few minutes I heard my father gently encouraging, then praising, Gian for reciting the poem he had made us memorise when we began the holiday: </p> <p> The heights by great men reached and kept </p> <p>Were not attained by sudden flight, </p> <p>But they, while their companions slept, </p> <p>Were toiling upward in the night </p> <p>When I couldn't stand the shame any longer, I crept out of the bathroom. \"Come here,\" my father barked at me. \"Kneel down,\" he growled. I knelt at the foot of the bed and he tossed me a copy of the Bible. \"Where in the Holy Bible,\" he said, pointing to the Gideon with his chin, \"does it say you should disobey your father?\" I thumbed the Bible half-heartedly. He repeated the question. Twice. I burst into tears. \"Aw, take it like a man,\" he griped. That night, I went to sleep convinced I was going to kill him before the holiday ended. </p> <p>The next day, he was all smiles. I was suspicious at first, but when he treated us to hamburgers for lunch, everything was forgiven. As we walked around the city centre after lunch, Gian and I were following a few steps behind my father, taking it in turns to re-enact and exorcise the previous night's drama. \"Where in the Holy Bible does it say you should disobey your father?\" we bellowed, mimicking his heavy African accent and repeating the question louder and more boldly as he walked ahead in silence. As we passed a window, I saw his face reflected in the glass. He was grinning. </p> <p>Although I was relieved, I was also baffled. It was only much later, when I was in Johannesburg two years after his death, that I finally understood why he was smiling that day in Los Angeles. </p> <p>I was hosting a round table of Nigerian pro-democracy activists in exile. Someone suggested that Ken Saro-Wiwa had been wrong to insist on non-violence as the best way to confront a vicious military regime. Most of the participants were adamant that pacifism was futile in the Nigerian context, that Abacha had given my father an emphatic answer to the efficacy of non-violence. </p> <p>One of the exiles disagreed. \"Ken Saro-Wiwa came to lecture at our university once,\" he recalled, \"and we put this very same question to him. And Ken replied that it was just like challenging your father. Your father is too strong, so you have to outwit him with your brains.\" </p> <p>The problem with fathers is that by the time you finally understand them, it is too late. As Mark Twain noted, when you're 14 your father is the most ignorant man you know. By the time you're 21 you're surprised at how much the old man has learned in seven years. </p> <p>I would love to know what was on my father's mind when he named my youngest brother Tedum Tambari. Loosely translated it means \"the tree of life, the one sent to do God's work\". I don't know what sort of expectations my father had of Tedum, but he turned out to be the kind of son he had always wanted. </p> <p>I didn't take much notice of Tedum at first. He ate. He slept. He cried. But mostly he ate. He had an uncanny knack of knowing when it was time to eat. You would just be settling down for supper, taking advantage of a moment's peace around the house while the baby slept, and he would start crying. The little man, as I later came to call him, loved his food. He especially loved African food, which was unusual for someone who was born and brought up in England. Tedum was proof that Africa is in the blood, because he loved going back to Nigeria. While the rest of his brothers and sisters were barricading themselves in air-conditioned rooms, Tedum was outside, soaking up the sun, feeling right at home. </p> <p>Everyone, especially my mother, loved my little brother. Nene [affectionate name for mother] needed something to hold on to because when we moved to England, she had to raise five kids on her own while adjusting to life in a foreign country and squeezing in a degree in her spare time. </p> <p>The first time I realised she was unhappy was when I walked into the bathroom one day and almost choked on the pungent mix of tobacco and air freshener in the room. She hardly touched a drink, let alone cigarettes. Although she tried to conceal it from us, we all knew. It wasn't the first time my father had strayed. Years later, Nene would tell me that friends had often warned her. But she was prepared to put up with his infidelities as long as he remained faithful to the family. </p> <p>I'd always been aware that my parents fought over his \"other women\". I must have been about four years old when Nene came back from boarding school and I heard my parents arguing. I was listening from my bedroom when my mother suddenly burst in. \"Junior,\" she rasped, her chest heaving with rage, \"has someone been in this house while I was away?\" He often had women over in the evenings, especially when Nene was away at school, but as she stood in the doorway, I had a feeling my answer might have serious repercussions. </p> <p> I told her I hadn't seen anyone in the house. She asked me if I was sure, repeating the question slowly and deliberately. I was gripped by a kind of terror I had never felt before. I didn't want to lie to her, but I also wanted to protect my father. More than anything, I wanted to keep the peace. I imagined that a no would somehow diffuse the tension. My mother stormed out and I lay on my bed, tormented by guilt as my parents carried on fighting. </p> <p>Although I felt it was my job to protect my mother from my father, I never truly offered her much protection from him. I never dared challenge my father, because each time I announced that I was ready to disown him, Nene would beg me to reconsider. \"He loves you, you know,\" she would say, warning me never to turn my back on him. </p> <p>Tedum was the only one who stood up to him. </p> <p>My little brother was 10 years younger than me, and I only began to take an interest in him when he started pestering me to play football and cricket. We became very close, although he was close to all his brothers and sisters. He was my parents' favourite, especially after he fulfilled my father's ambition to send a son to Eton College. </p> <p>I remember seeing him at Christmas, when I went down to our home outside London. Tedum was in festive spirits, especially after he thrashed me at table football for the first time. I took it on the chin, smiling ruefully. I was proud of him. I sensed that the dynamics of our relationship were changing. On New Year's Eve, I went back to my flat. Tedum saw me out of the house. As he closed the door, I vividly remember the smug grin and knowing look on his face. It was the last time I ever saw the little man. </p> <p>March 15, the ides of March, was a sunny day, the first day of spring, and the daffodils were out. I remember every detail of that day. I rang my girlfriend Olivia in the morning and we arranged to meet at my flat later that evening. I was coming to the end of my media course at journalism school. I remember sitting on a lawn at college, laughing and joking with my friends that afternoon. At about 4pm there was a chill in the air. I went inside, pottered around for a couple of hours, then left for my flat. After about 20 minutes, the doorbell rang. It was Olivia. A few minutes after she arrived, the phone rang. Mike, my flatmate, took the call. </p> <p>\"Someone wants to speak to Mr Saro-Wiwa,\" he said, announcing my name with exaggerated formality as he handed the phone to me. </p> <p>\"Hello? Mr Saro-Wiwa?\" </p> <p>\"Yes?\" I answered. </p> <p>\"It's Mr Wright here.\" </p> <p>My mind went blank. </p> <p>\"I'm Tedum's housemaster at Eton,\" the voice explained. \"I've, err, got some very bad news, I'm afraid.\" </p> <p>What had Tedum done? Has he been expelled? Smoking? Drugs? </p> <p>\"I'm afraid Tedum is dead,\" he said, interrupting my train of thought. </p> <p>\"What?\" I gasped. </p> <p>\"Tedum was playing the field game,\" Mr Wright began to explain. \"He played really well, as usual.\" I just kept shaking my head, saying no, no, no. I wanted to drop the phone. \"At the end of the game, Tedum said he felt a swelling in his left ankle,\" Mr Wright continued, determined to provide me with all the facts. \"He went to sit down by a tree. He said he felt dizzy and thirsty. A friend ran to get him some water. By the time his friend came back, Tedum was lying on the ground unconscious. An ambulance arrived on the scene within minutes. The paramedics spent 45 minutes trying to revive him. I'm sorry.\" </p> <p>I hung up and collapsed on the floor. I was absolutely devastated. He was 14 years old, with so much potential, so much to live for, and he was dead. I broke down, overcome as much by grief as by an overwhelming sense of guilt. \"Tedum is dead,\" I kept repeating, as if trying to convince myself. One minute he had been full of life and now he was dead, at 14, of a heart attack. It just didn't add up. It was impossible. I was desperately trying to gather my thoughts when the phone rang again. It was Mr Wright. \"I just wanted to give you some more details, Ken. I've spoken to your parents in Nigeria and they are on their way. Tedum's body is in the mortuary but we will wait for your father to arrive before we do anything else. I'm sorry, Ken. Good night.\" </p> <p>I grabbed a pack of cigarettes and went for a walk, taking the same route Tedum and I had walked to watch his first football match just three months earlier. I couldn't believe that the strapping, gawky kid who was so looking forward to his first match was now lying in a mortuary. I sat on the pavement on the corner of Fulham Road. All kinds of thoughts were swimming around my mind. Nene ... I felt so desperately sorry for her; I felt impotent, unable to help her once again. She was so far away from the little boy she had pinned so much hope on. My sisters ... Christ, I thought. I hadn't even spoken to them. I rushed back to my flat and dialled a Brighton number. </p> <p>Noo was the first to come to the phone. Then Zina. Neither of them had been told. My father had instructed their teachers not to tell them until he arrived in England. He had wanted to break the news to them himself. The next day, Tedum's death was reported in the papers: \"The son of a wealthy Nigerian businessman died tragically at Eton College yesterday.\" I can't imagine how my sisters would have felt it they had found out from the newspaper. My father was just too far away to understand or appreciate some things. </p> <p>I went home the next day. He had arrived from Nigeria but was alone in the house. \"Where's Nene?\" I barked at him. He told me she was arriving later. I was incensed that they hadn't flown together. He glared at me as if to suggest that it was none of my business. An uneasy silence fell over the house and it didn't break until three days later, when we were heading home from the mortuary after seeing Tedum's body. My father was driving and I was in the passenger seat; my mother and my sisters were in the back. The atmosphere was unbearable: there was grief, resentment and anger in the air. When my father wondered aloud whether the campaign against Shell might not have had something to do with Tedum's death, my sisters and I exploded in unison. We told him to keep his politics out of Tedum's death. </p> <p>Although his concern was at the forefront of our minds as well, we didn't want him to bring it up. \"I'm just trying to protect the rest of you,\" he protested, but we ganged up on him again. He was surprised by the strength of feeling in the ranks. He fell silent, stuffed his pipe in his mouth and started puffing away, popping his lips furiously. </p> <p>Looking back on it, I feel sorry for him. It was as if his children were telling him that he had forfeited his right to be their father. We had willingly given up our father to his political commitment, but we were desperately trying to resist the notion that his politics might invade, jeopardise and compromise our privacy, and even our lives. </p> <p>After the funeral, we went back to Eton to plant a tree near the spot where Tedum had died. We walked back to the car, my father leading the way, his family trailing behind him. He had completely withdrawn from the process by then, and he was conscious that I disapproved. He was probably desperate to go back to Nigeria; in England, he was a stranger in his own house, and he was being made to feel guilty about his shortcomings as the head of his family. In Nigeria, on the other hand, he was being hailed as the father of his people. He could do no wrong there. </p> <p>He looked a mess as he trudged back to the car through the muddy field. He was wearing a long, shabby brown fur coat, the hem of which almost touched the wet grass. As he walked along he suddenly kicked the air in frustration. I don't know why but I just had this feeling that he only did it for my benefit, to show me that he did care. </p> <p>It took me a long time to reconcile myself to the guilt I felt that Tedum had died instead of me. Tests later showed that I had a milder form of the congenital disease that killed him. I had an operation that summer, but I couldn't sleep for months after Tedum died. Nene spooked me when she told me that she had had a vivid dream before she travelled to Nigeria. She dreamt that one of our ancestors came to take me away, but she had pleaded so hard for me that they took Tedum instead. </p> <p>On the night before Tedum's funeral, Zina, Noo and I had sat in his bedroom talking about our little brother. Noo recalled how Tedum had once made my father cry. </p> <p>\"How did he do that?!\" I exclaimed. </p> <p>\"Oh, he just confronted him about Nene, and Jeje broke down.\" </p> <p>I was astonished. My little brother had done what I should have been doing all along, protecting Nene from my father. I was proud of the little man, and embarrassed for myself. The next day, as I scattered earth over Tedum's coffin, I paused and made a silent promise to him. </p> <p>In many, many ways, Tedum's death was the turning point in my life. Trying to make sense of it, I began to look into the ways Africans deal with death, and I came to understand that my little brother was a spirit child. A spirit child is born and reborn many times, moving between the spirit world and the real world. When a spirit child is recalled, he has to go, and thus spirit children often die in childbirth or at a young age. Ben Okri's wonderful evocation of childhood, The Famished Road, tells the story of Azaro Lazarus - a spirit child who refuses to return to the spirit world when his time is up. </p> <p>While I had seen myself as Tedum's substitute father and mentor, I came to appreciate that he had actually been my guiding angel, a spirit child, the son that shone over my father's house. He kept the house warm, comforting my mother until his time was up. Tedum Tambari, the tree of life, the one sent to do God's work, left us just as storm clouds gathered over Ken Saro-Wiwa's house. </p> <p>He came over to London again at Christmas. It was our first Christmas since Tedum's death, and I hoped it would help to get out of the usual routine at my parents' home. My father turned down my invitation, explaining that he would rather fast for our people, that we had no right to enjoy a meal while our people were suffering. I took the snub as it was intended - as a protest against my apolitical stance, but I felt the family needed to come first.The next time I saw him was in the New Year. By then my brother Gian, who had suffered a breakdown in Nigeria two years earlier, had returned to England to get treatment after having a relapse and contracting malaria. Gian was in a terrible state. He was wasted from the malaria, and he was severely agitated by his experiences in Nigeria. Arrangements were made for my father to visit Gian's doctor so they could establish the cause of my brother's relapse. I saw Gian on the day of the scheduled appointment. When I asked his doctor how the meeting with my father had gone, the doctor shook his head. </p> <p>\"He never turned up.\" </p> <p>\"What? What do you mean?\" I snapped. </p> <p>\"He didn't make the appointment. We waited for him, but your father never showed up.\" </p> <p>When I left the hospital, I was determined to give him a piece of my mind. But when I arrived at home, he wasn't there. My mother was in the kitchen, and when I told her what had happened at the hospital she sighed. A few minutes later, he shuffled wearily into the house. His tie was hanging loosely around his neck, the old brown coat looked shabbier than ever, and he was struggling with a pile of documents. He paused in the doorway when he saw me, smiled nervously, and walked into the sitting room. </p> <p>\"Have you been to see Gian?\" I barked at his back, following him into the lounge. He hauled his briefcase onto the dining table, took off his coat and glared at me. I stared him down and he backed off. He sat down and started rifling through the papers on the table. He looked broken, almost pitiful, as he absent-mindedly patted the documents strewn on the table. After a few moments, he glanced up at me plaintively. That look is frozen in my mind. It still haunts me, because I suddenly saw through my father. His hair was matted, there were flecks of grey stubble on his chin, and his eyes looked tired and bloodshot. In that moment, I saw my father for what he was: an old man struggling to meet the incredible personal and political demands on him. </p> <p>My anger began to dissolve. A little voice was urging me to confront him, but another voice insisted I leave him alone. I hovered between anger and guilt for a few seconds. Then, cursing under my breath, I walked away. He was staring at the wreckage of his life scattered across the dining table as I left. It was the last time I ever saw my father. </p> <p>That we parted on such a bad note is one of my greatest regrets. But when I stormed out of the house that afternoon in January 1994, we were poles apart. I didn't understand him; I just couldn't see how he could be leading a struggle that he said was for the future, for us, his children, while he neglected those children's immediate needs and wellbeing. That afternoon, I only understood that his youngest son was dead and another was fighting for his life in hospital, and that all he seemed to care about was his political campaign. I saw a pattern developing, and I didn't want to sacrifice my life for his political conscience. So I turned my back on him. </p> <p>A week later, he went back to Nigeria, leaving the battle on his homefront for another war. </p> <p>It was past midnight when I heard the news. The phone rang at my flat in west London. My mother was on the other end. I knew it was bad news. </p> <p>\"Junior!\" she whispered. \"Tanga le be-e!\" </p> <p>There is trouble at home. My heart sank. </p> <p>I had a numb, sickening feeling that life wouldn't be the same again. Four Ogoni Chiefs - Albert Badey, Tom Orage, Sam Orage and Edward Kobani - were dead, and my father had been arrested in connection with their murders. One of the murdered men, Sam Orage, was my uncle. He was the husband of my aunt Elizabeth, my mother's oldest sister. Images of my cousins Barine, Tom, Desmond and Tuma flashed up in my mind's eye. What kind of sick twist of fate could have brought this on my family, I wondered. I couldn't imagine why or how my father could be implicated in the murder of his friend Edward Kobani, the father of my childhood friends Tombari and Edward. </p> <p>I paced around in a daze, trying to understand the news. But it just didn't make sense. I hadn't been following events in Ogoni, and I had no idea of what had been going on down there. To my apolitical and distanced mind the violence seemed so out of place, out of character, for the Ogoni I knew. It seemed like the kind of senseless butchering that you read about in places like Rwanda. The Ogoni I knew was a docile, peaceful place. </p> <p>The most distressing part of it was that the murders split my family right down the middle. On one side was my father's family and on the other was my mother's. Family ties and loyalties were suddenly stretched. Childhood friends, favourite cousins, would now be separated by a blood feud. As I paced, I tried to figure out what to do. Make the wrong move, say the wrong thing, and it would have far-reaching, emotionally wrenching consequences. </p> <p>In such circumstances all you can do is trust your instincts. I picked up the phone and dialled a number in Los Angeles. My cousin Desmond Orage answered. He could barely speak. </p> <p>\"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry,\" was all I managed to say. There we were, two cousins who had been making plans to meet up in Los Angeles in a few months' time, but now his father had been hacked to death by a mob and my father was alleged to have ordered the killing. </p> <p>\u0095 Read the second part of this article <a href=\"http://gnome.theguardian.com/Books/extracts/story/0,6761,388922,00.html\"> here </a></p> <p> \u0095 Extracted from The Shadow of a Saint by Ken Wiwa, published by Doubleday on 2nd November priced \u00a316.99.</p>",
  "<p>Unlike the tea ceremony, flower arranging and calligraphy, the Japanese have yet to codify the art of making sushi. If they ever do, Yosuke Imada would be a leading candidate for compiling the rulebook. </p> <p>As the owner of Kyubey, Japan's most prestigious chain of sushi restaurants, Imada has helped set the standard for the country's best-known cuisine with an artist's eye for detail and an engineer's approach to quality control. Everything about him seems to embody sleekness. It is there in his trim appearance - slim with carefully manicured, scrubbed hands and not a hair out of place. It is also there in the minimalist architecture of the company's main restaurant in Tokyo's Ginza district, a dark five-storey building with no windows and the narrowest of entrance ways. And, of course, it is there in the sliced raw fish and mouth-sized beds of rice that he squeezes into shape for his well-heeled customers. </p> <p>It's a buttoned-down style that has worked a treat. Despite charging some of the highest prices in Tokyo amid Japan's worst recession in 10 years, Kyubey is always packed to its pine rafters. Everyone from government leaders to famous actors knows its trademark dishes, such as dancing shrimp (so-called because they are eaten alive) and raw bonito with garlic. </p> <p>Imada stands at the pinnacle of a vast and expanding sushi industry that has permeated every level of Japanese life. Busy salarymen snack on triangles of onigiri and rolls of nutto-maki. Hungry students and train travellers buy sushi boxed lunches from convenience stores and station kiosks. Families entertain with do-it-yourself temaki sushi parties at home. For a little more expertise and atmosphere, people can choose to eat out from about 45,000 sushi restaurants - that converts into at least one for every neighbourhood in the country. Sushi is most definitely not something you make at home - even in its country of origin. </p> <p>In recent years, there has also been an explosion of factory-like \"kaiten\" shops, which cut costs by spinning out sushi to customers who sit around a conveyor belt - a few such enterprises have already made their way to London, and all the signs are that others will follow in increasing numbers, at least in the metropolitan areas. </p> <p>Many purists have criticised this de-personalisation of the sushi experience, but Imada himself views it as a positive development: \"We are at opposite ends of the spectrum,\" he says, \"but I think the kaiten shops are good for business because they are helping to make sushi more popular.\" </p> <p>He has every historical and personal reason to be openminded. Contrary to its reputation as the traditional food of Japan, sushi's roots lie in fairly shallow ground. The origins of the modern dish are usually traced back to 1824, when a Tokyo fish trader named Yohei Hanaya began selling raw cuts of fish from Edo Bay on fingers of sour rice. Edo-mae sushi, as it became known, was an instant hit, but it was considered fast food rather than gourmet dining for the next 100 years. </p> <p>Kyubey had an equally humble beginning as a takeaway, when it was established by Imada's father in 1936. \"Our family lived on the second floor, while dad worked below. He made the sushi kneeling down, and either delivered it or sold it from a street stall. It was tough, but he made a success of it and I was filled with admiration. At the age of eight, I knew I wanted to be a sushi chef like him.\" </p> <p>That meant a 30-month apprenticeship, starting with a lesson in hygiene - repeatedly cleaning the floors and surfaces. \"It was two years before I was allowed to use a knife,\" recalls Imada. He was lucky. Today, the top itamai-san (sushi chefs) train for about 10 years. </p> <p>That is because the job description has changed along with the business. Kyubey is now a multi-million dollar operation with 140 staff, and outlets in five of Tokyo's top hotels. Its chefs still make takeaway sushi, but at the same time they must now also feed, entertain and tot up the charges for every customer at the counter. \"We are all-round personal managers. If you cannot play the part of waiter, sommelier, accountant and conversation partner, then you can't be an itamai-san,\" insists Imada. </p> <p>On top of that, the chefs have to put an astonishing amount of tender loving care into each mouthful of sushi. This means purchasing the freshest and best-quality ingredients from the nearby Tsukiji market every day. With fish now being flown in from all over the world, nothing is ever out of season, but it is crucial to know where and when to buy. Tuna is best in the autumn, when these giants of the seas start to fatten up, while the tastiest Matsudake mushrooms - which cost as much as \u00a330 apiece - are picked from a single hill in Kyoto during a two-week window. </p> <p>Imada goes to considerable lengths to ensure that all his ingredients are kept as fresh as possible, which in many cases means alive. Shrimps and shellfish scuttle around in basement storage ponds right up to the moment that they are ordered and then eaten live. Cuts of tuna, on the other hand, taste better after being left to hang for a few days. The shari (soured rice) must have just the right consistency: too hard and it becomes chewy, too soft and it falls apart as the itamai-san tries to shape it. The wasabi should be freshly ground, fragrant and used sparingly. And then there is the art of choosing the best combination of 25 different kinds of fish - some grilled, some raw - with more subtle seasonings, such as soy sauce, sake, lime, salt, garlic and ginger. Ultimately, explains Imada, you should judge your meal not on the taste of an individual piece of sushi but on the overall mix of flavour, texture, colour and nutrition. </p> <p>Imada is happy to add teacher to the list of roles that an itamai-san must play, especially to foreign diners, whose changing attitude towards sushi is one of the biggest shifts he has noticed in his lifetime. \"For years, sushi was always considered weird and unsafe, because so much of it was raw. Now, though, it seems foreigners are realising that the opposite is true - the standards for sushi are higher because it is impossible to hide bad ingredients.\" </p> <p>The reason for the change, he guesses, is that companies such as Sony and Honda have altered international perceptions about Japanese quality control. \"Thanks to them, I think people started to look at sushi in a new way.\" </p> <p>The reference to manufacturing seems appropriate for a man who selects his words as carefully as his ingredients: \"I am not an artist. If I'm any good at my job, the food will disappear down people's throats almost as soon as it's made. But I must admit that, sometimes, I'll look at a piece of sushi and think that it's so beautifully made that it is a waste to eat it. Maybe there's a bit of the craftsman in me, after all.\" </p> <p><strong> IMADA-SAN'S SUSHI DOS AND DON'TS </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Know your sushi</strong> </p> <p>First, don't make the common mistake of confusing sashimi (cuts of raw fish) with sushi (cooked or raw slices of fish and vegetables that can sit on or snuggle inside a bed of rice). Try to learn the names of the different dishes if you want to impress an itamai-san. And please, says Imada, don't ask for 'maguro' (tuna), which is like going to a steak house and ordering 'cow'. Instead, ask for a particular cut of tuna, such as chu-toro (middle belly). </p> <p><strong> Wasabi</strong> </p> <p>'If you don't like wasabi,' says Imada, 'then you shouldn't be allowed to eat sushi.' But go easy: foreigners, he says, tend to use too much of the spice, wiping out the other more delicate flavours of the sushi. If you do want more of the green stuff, then it is good manners to ask the chef for it while he is making your next dish, rather than splodging it on yourself. If you insist on playing with the horseradish, use your chopsticks to spread a little on to the fish. Never stir wasabi into more than the edge of your soy sauce. </p> <p><strong> Soy sauce</strong> </p> <p>Consider yourself bottom of the class if you end up with even a single grain of rice floating around in your soy sauce. To avoid this, use your fingers or chopsticks (either is perfectly acceptable) to grip the top and bottom of the sushi - rather than the two sides - so that you can turn it upside down. This will allow you stylishly to dip just a corner of the flesh into the sauce. </p> <p><strong> Down in one</strong> </p> <p>'Please don't destroy our masterpieces,' pleads Imada. In other words, as well as avoiding a potentially soggy break-up in the soy sauce, don't try to bite the sushi in half - after all, it has been made for popping into your mouth whole. If it is a little too big, then tell the chef to change the size next time around - a good itamai-san will not need to be asked. </p> <p><strong> Wetting your whistle</strong> </p> <p>In parts of Japan, there's a belief that you should never drink sake while eating sushi because they are both derived from rice. Imada, however, is very liberal when it comes to drink: 'We serve sake, green tea, beer, red wine and even champagne with our sushi. As long as the customer is happy, then who are we to complain?' </p> <p><strong> Order of play</strong> </p> <p>While the first priority in ordering will obviously be to pick your favourites, Imada says a sushi meal must be judged in its entirety, which means choosing a good balance of dishes. In Kyubey, most customers start with the fatty red flesh of toro (from tuna), followed by one or two pieces of white meat, such as sea bream, flounder or turbot. Next, usually comes squid, then a live shrimp or shellfish. Between dishes, you should munch on a slice of ginger - the tangier the better - which serves as a reset button for your tastebuds. To ensure a good nutritional mix, order side dishes of miso soup, daikon and seaweed. </p> <p><strong> THE THREE BASIC CATEGORIES OF SUSHI </strong></p> <p> <strong> Nigiri-zushi (pressed sushi)</strong> </p> <p>Hand pressing shari (rice soured with vinegar) into a slim slab. You can put just about anything on this, though raw, cooked or marinated seafood is most common. Popular toppings are ika (squid), which should be almost translucent and tender; anago (saltwater eel), usually boiled, grilled and brushed with sauce, and toro (the best cut from a tuna), which should be flecked with white fat. </p> <p><strong> Maki-zushi (wrapped sushi)</strong> </p> <p>Thinly spread shari and the filling of your choice on to a sheet of nori (dried seaweed). Then either roll it with a bamboo mat or shape it by hand into a cone. Popular fillings include cucumber, fermented soya bean, pickles, salmon roe and raw fish. </p> <p><strong> Chirashi-zushi (scattered sushi)</strong> </p> <p>Fill the bottom of a bowl with shari (this time sweetened with a little sugar), then throw in your favourite ingredients - shrimps, strips of omelette, nori and cucumber are common - on top of the bed of rice </p> <p>\u0095 Yosuke Imada is head itamai-san of Kyubey, 8-7-6 Ginza, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo, tel 0081 (0)3 3571 6523.</p>",
  "According to Cassandra Latham, the rules of spell-casting are: don't dabble but do persist; do not start anything that you can't finish; be aware that anything you wish for in another person may come back to you; and be precise. 'Don't just ask for money, because your nearest and dearest might drop down dead, leaving you an inheritance.' <p><b> Candle magic</b></p> <p> 'A good general-purpose spell that anyone who believes in it can do,' says Latham. Pick a candle of an appropriate colour for the job (green or pink for love, yellow for wealth, red for strength, blue for good fortune, mauve for wisdom, brown for stability). If you wish to draw something towards yourself, write its name from the top of the candle to the bottom. If it's something you want to dispel, write it from the bottom to the top. Candle magic, like most magic, is best done after dark. To draw something to you, begin the spell on a new moon; to dispel it, begin on a waning moon. Light the candle and strongly visualise what you want to achieve for as long as you can maintain concentration. Blow out the candle. Repeat the procedure the next night, and again each night until the moon has completed its waxing or waning. Bury or burn the candle debris. Don't throw it away. Don't talk about the spell; and, once it's done, forget about it. </p> <p><b> Witches' ladder</b></p> <p> Dedicate a piece of rope to magic. Following the same lunar pattern as for candle magic, each night tie one knot in the rope while strongly visualising what you wish to achieve. Tie the knots towards you to draw your object inward and away from you to dispel it. Witches' ladders have a long tradition in Cornwall, where they were commonly sold to fishermen before a trip out to sea. Untying the first knot would unleash a light breeze, the second a stronger wind and so on. A witches' ladder also refers to a string of 40 beads used like a rosary as an aid to concentrated repetition. </p> <p><b> Witches' poppets</b> </p> <p>Poppets are wax, clay or even Plasticene figures resembling the person on whom the magic is to be focused. In a coven, the poppet may be consecrated on a witches' altar, attached by cord to both a woman and a man (according to the Wiccan belief, that male and female energy combined create the most effective magic), and given the appropriate symbolic treatment. The poppet's leg might be bandaged as part of a healing ritual, or its mouth might be sewn up to prevent the living person it represents from spreading gossip. Once the spell has worked, the poppet will be burned or buried, thereby releasing the spell. </p> <p> When I was a little girl, I thought I was a witch. Borrowing my mum's old milkpan, I would pass balmy summer evenings stirring livid stews of wild berries and gladioli over a bonfire at the back of our garden, then pour the resulting brew into jam jars and label them \"potion\". I communicated with other (invisible) witches in witch language scrawled over my cupboard door. I made up witch songs and caterwauled them out of the window at night. I began demanding to be persecuted. My particular hankering was to be tossed into a chasm, though these are not at all common around Basildon. To my mother and father's credit, they resisted what must by then have been the almost irresistible, and I lived on. Not content with my good luck, I acquired a black cat. Finally, and to my eternal regret, I fed my hamster to a toad. </p> <p>Some time soon after, I discovered Fuzzy Felt, or perhaps it was Pippa dolls, and forgot all about witchcraft. Until a couple of years ago, that is, when The Old Religion, as witches often call it, suddenly emerged from the broom closet and into the light. The Craft and The Blair Witch Project appeared on film, The Witches Of Eastwick went into production as a musical. The first of the Harry Potter books was published and sold in its millions. Sabrina The Teenage Witch and Buffy The Vampire Slayer began airing on British TV. All over Britain (and America and beyond), Hecate was getting hip. Something curious was happening. </p> <p>It got curiouser and curiouser. During my research for this article, I found a tarantula on my doorstep. Sometime later, a live crow in a knotted dustbin bag appeared (and flew to its freedom the moment I opened the bag). Now, crows and tarantulas don't wash up on my doorstep every day, but life is plump with coincidence, weirdness happens, and though intrigued and slightly ruffled I carried on all the same. </p> <p>According to the Pagan Federation, there are currently 10,000 initiated witches in this country and more than 100,000 pagans. Compare this with 6,000 practising British Druids and 4,000 Buddhists, and you'll get the point. What was once taboo is now almost de rigueur. The witch religion, Wicca (wicce is the Anglo-Saxon word for witch), though only founded within the past 50 years, is growing fast. And we're exporting it. In the past couple of years, Wicca has really taken off on the continent and in the English-speaking world, most particularly in the US and Australia. No one knows how many Wiccans or witches there are worldwide, but a million would probably cover it. And it all began here in Britain. </p> <p>Some definitions are called for. Wicca is a subset of paganism, as well as being the witch religion, and while all Wiccans are witches (even the men), not all witches are Wiccans. Some witches are agnostics, or Christians, or Hindus, or just plain old witches. The latter are often known as hedge witches. They tend to work alone and often describe themselves as being in The Craft. Most Wiccans, by contrast, work in covens. It goes without saying that not all pagans are witches, nor, necessarily, are all witches pagans. Wizards and warlocks, by the way, are neither witches nor Wiccans, but people (usually men) who practise high magic (more of which later) with no overtly religious context. So far as we know, there aren't many of them. </p> <p>To make it all crystal clear, let's just say that The Witches Of Eastwick are Wiccans, Sabrina is a hedge witch and, if Harry Potter is anything, then he is probably a wizard. Paganism and witchcraft have been a thriving part of British culture for as long as there are records. In the 11th century, King Canute was sufficiently threatened by them to issue anti-pagan and anti-witchcraft laws, and witchcraft was still illegal in this country until 1951. But The Craft was relatively tolerated in England. Elizabeth I had her own court witch in the form of John Dee, the royal alchemist, and even during the great witch-hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, witches were rarely burned alive in England, as they were in continental Europe and Scotland. They were hanged or strangled, then burned. </p> <p>Having lain low for a century or so after those particular horrors, British witches began to re-emerge in the 18th century, in the guise of cunning men and wise women, local oddballs who lived on the outskirts of villages and ministered to broken hearts and neighbourhood grievances. </p> <p>Cassandra Latham still does. Britain's only professional witch (her tax return states her occupation as \"village witch\"), Latham whips up charms and spells for the locals of St Buryan, near Land's End, and, via her website, for anyone else prepared to stump up a modest fee or offer a skill to trade. Latham even looks the part - a tiny, impish thing with sky-blue eyes and witchy, black hair, chopped, rather charmingly, mullet-style. A qualified nurse and counsellor, Latham turned to witching 16 years ago, after a back injury put paid to her nursing career, but she always knew she was different: \"I didn't have a wonderful childhood and I retreated into otherworldliness. Part of the work I do now involves walking between this world and the spirit world, and I did that, too, when I was a child. It used to be an escape route, now it's a choice.\" </p> <p>Glaswegian pensioner Mary Rands inherited her interest in witchcraft from her grandmother, who was considered \"fey\". Rands' sister is also a witch. \"I chose witchcraft, but witchcraft also chose me,\" she says. Most witches have no family connections to The Craft, but feel drawn nonetheless. Maureen Brown is a qualified Jungian psychotherapist, who has been a member of a coven in Croydon for the past 26 years. \"As a child, I was considered strange because I saw things with lights around them, which I now know to be auras. I was always different. I was always a seeker.\" In her early 20s, Brown was introduced to two witches at a party and never looked back. \"By that time, I had experimented with many of the major religions, but I just knew that witchcraft was for me.\" </p> <p>Caroline Robertson, proprietor of Westbury Music, the UK's leading independent dance-music label, was initiated into Wicca four years ago, but her interest in witchcraft began in childhood. \"I was always a daydreamer. I believed in the force and power of nature and in the mystery of life.\" She bought her first pack of tarot cards at university. \"It was 1970, Lennon and McCartney were doing their thing and everyone was getting a bit mystical.\" According to Robertson, you don't have to be born a witch, but it takes a certain kind of person to become one. \"A businessman's mind would be wasted in a coven. Witchcraft is about threshold worlds and shifting realities. It appeals to odd people, loners, folk who don't follow the normal rules.\" </p> <p>Cassandra Latham doesn't follow \"the normal rules\", but her clients - she sees about 200 a year - tend to be regular Joes and Joannas with all the usual problems. \"The reasons people used to go to cunning folk in the past are the same as the reasons people come to me now. Relationships, jobs, money, health. People often ask me to cleanse their homes of psychic debris. One of the most common things I get asked to do is to remove curses, but no one ever asks me for anything ridiculous. It's pastoral work, just like the vicar, really.\" </p> <p>Well, not quite like the vicar (though Latham says she gets on well with him). \"What makes me different from a psychotherapist or any other counsellor is that I use magic. I believe that old habit patterns lie in the unconscious. If you want to change them, you need to communicate to the unconscious in a way it'll respond to - with symbols and archetypes and ritual. If you perform a spell with particular motifs, it will clear the unconscious ground. I find it very effective and very quick. You could spend years in psychotherapy getting to that point, whereas magic will take the shortest route, and in it goes.\" </p> <p>Ah yes, magic. It's nonsense, obviously. Well, perhaps not complete nonsense. But definitely something for the funny folk. Except, except ... we all do it. Every time we step over cracks in the pavement, don our lucky ties for the job interview, spit on the dice before we throw, we have fallen under magic's spell. Vivianne Crowley, senior lecturer in the psychology of religion at London University, puts it like this: \"Magical thinking gives us a sense of control in a world of random events. It gives you a sense that the universe is listening to you and speaking to you. Psychologically, that can be a very useful strategy.\" Children employ magical thinking every day and the world religions all have some magical element. What else are biblical miracles or the mysticism of the Jewish cabbala? However much we may pooh-pooh magic, we seem to be saturated in it all the same. \"Magic connects with people on some ancient level,\" says Latham. \"It's like a race memory almost. It hits the primitive part of our minds.\" </p> <p>Crowley agrees: \"Most witches believe that magic is innate in the human psyche. It's something lots of people can develop.\" She's not talking about sawing ladies in half or card tricks. She's talking about actual, transformative magic. </p> <p>But what is magic? Well, no one really knows, but received wisdom defines it as the use of the will to effect change, and recognises two types: natural and high, or ritualistic. In natural magic, witches emphasise folk wisdom. They may cast spells and use candles, herbs, wax images, crystals and scrying or divination objects such as crystal balls and dowsing rods, as well as more familiar psychological techniques such as meditation, visualisation and repetition to focus their minds on the effects they want to manifest. Natural magic is craftwork, and its practitioners regard themselves as craftsmen and women. They are in The Craft. </p> <p>High or ritualistic magic tends to focus more on ceremony, ritual and invocation. Alchemists were generally high magicians, but high magic's most famous son is probably the turn-of-the-century mystic and occultist Aleister Crowley. Most ritualistic magic is conducted in groups or covens. Witchcraft's own religion, Wicca, makes much use of it. \"The difference,\" says Latham, \"is that high magic is formal and theatrical.\" </p> <p>Does magic work? Graham King thinks so. Four years ago, King sold his successful business making specialist cameras for archive libraries, got rid of the Jag and the country cottage, burned his collection of silk ties and bought the Museum Of Witchcraft, Boscastle, on the north coast of Cornwall, which he now runs as a going concern. Fifty thousand visitors come to the museum every year to peer at the cases of charms, amulets, poppets (wax dolls), wands, athames (ceremonial knives), scourges (ceremonial whips) and talismans. Having spent 20years as a scientist, technician and businessman, King now devotes his life to witchery. \"I'm a scientist, but I believe in magic because I've seen it work,\" he says. \"I don't know why it works, but I accept it does. Look, I have been employed in the electronics industry, and I don't know how electricity really works, either, but it does, right?\" He has a point. Hands up who really understands how the telly makes pictures, or the microwave makes dinners. As for the VCR . . . </p> <p>Debate as to whether magic is a psychological or supernatural power, or a bit of both, boils like a brothy cauldron in the witching community. Vivianne Crowley (no relation to Aleister, incidentally) is in no doubt. \"The power of magic is 90% psychological and 10% anomalous events not beyond scientific understanding but beyond current scientific understanding. Even the British Psychological Society has become interested in the ability of spiritual practices to manifest healing powers, and in clairvoyance, psychometry [the ability to divine by touching something] and telepathy, those techniques psychologists call parapsychology.\" She points out that there is now a chair of parapsychology at Edinburgh University, it's that respectable. </p> <p>According to Crowley, Wiccans simply harness and develop these parapsychological techniques. Which is both disappointing (no fabulous supernatural phenomena) and intriguing (anyone can do it). \"Could I turn a lightbulb into a frog?\" asks Maureen Brown. \"Yes, but it would take a very long time, and all my energy, and it's easier to work for the money and then go and buy a frog.\" Caroline Robertson agrees: \"I could probably change plastic to gold, but it would take years.\" Crowley is sceptical. When I told her that some witches claimed to be able to turn lightbulbs into frogs, she just laughed and said, \"Rubbish!\" </p> <p>The obvious question remains. If magic is as powerful as some witches claim it to be, why can't witches put a stop to famine/war/ disease? And why isn't every witch a millionaire? Or immortal? Ah, well. For one thing, witches are human, as fallible as doctors or politicians (and we all know how fallible they are). Most witches just aren't all that competent, and the ones who are tend not to mouth off about it. Not so long ago, a very public attempt by the self-proclaimed king of the witches, Kevin Carlyon, to prevent the building of the Channel Tunnel by burning an effigy of a train raised a good few nudge-nudge, wink-winks in the pubs around Lewes, East Sussex, Carlyon's home town, and knocked something of a dent in the reputation of The Craft. These days, most witches have learned to be more modest about their powers. \"I'm not Superwitch. I would say that I have a 70% success rate,\" says Latham, \"but I can't think of any business which is 100% all the time.\" </p> <p>Then there's the responsibility. \"If people think I'm going to wave a magic wand and whisk their problems away, they have to think again,\" says Latham. \"I can help you to help yourself is all. If I waved a wand, I'd just be disempowering you.\" If that sounds a bit like self-help waffle, witches insist they get results. King recently cast spells for a couple who were finding it hard to conceive, and \"baby Sean arrived nine months later\". On the other hand, \"I only get involved with things where there's real need. Someone who just wants a new boyfriend can sort themselves out.\" </p> <p>What about black magic? Officially, Wicca operates a no-harm principle, the so-called Wiccan Rede, but King claims that \"the principle is recent and not many witches stick to it\". King himself admits to having cast spells with \"broken mirrors and effigies and coffins to warn people to behave well. The circumstances haven't yet arisen where I might actually curse someone, but that's not to say there are no such circumstances.\" </p> <p>Rands isn't so circumspect. In the 30-odd years she's been a witch (and a civil servant, qualified nurse, nanny), she's found herself in the hexing business twice. \"Oh, I've stamped my foot and pointed my finger all right. I'm old-fashioned in that way. An eye for an eye. I cursed one man who was forcing his sexual attentions on women and he's now got a very nasty incurable skin disease. That might not have been my doing, of course, it might have happened anyway. But...\" </p> <p>That said, most witches hesitate to use black magic because they believe in the threefold boomerang - that their actions will return to them three times over. Since sending her victim a skin disease, Rands' own health has taken a downturn. \"If that's because I've ill-wished someone, then I have to take responsibility.\" Then she chuckles. \"But it was worth it.\" </p> <p>Cursing and hexing are partly what gives witchcraft a bad name, of course. But even if black magic were effective, in the context of the damage done in the name of the world religions, a little skin disease among rou\u00e9s doesn't seem so bad. All the same, there's a reluctance among many witches to talk freely. You can hardly blame them for having a persecution complex. Somewhere in the region of 40,000, mostly women, were murdered in Britain during the great witch-hunts, for an assortment of evils ranging from spinsterhood and warts to ergot poisoning. (Ergot is a fungus that infects rye, causing convulsions and hallucinations in anyone who eats it. There is now plenty of evidence to suggest that the symptoms of the \"possessions\" at Salem and elsewhere - in the UK in East Anglia especially - during the witch-hunt period were the result of ergot poisoning.) </p> <p>Even now, in our secular age, we can't quite make up our minds about The Craft. Though the Witchcraft Act was repealed in 1951, we're still edgy about witching. Lest we forget, it was only 15 years ago that we had our own Salem, with the tabloids screaming blue murder over supposed acts of satanic abuse by witches and Devil worshippers. Even though a 1994 government enquiry into the whole affair found that ritual abuse \"has never been substantiated by empirical evidence\", the public remains willing to lump witchcraft in with Satanism, as though the two were some devilish double act. (For the record, witches do not believe in the existence of Satan, so it would be a little eccentric of them to worship him/her/it.) </p> <p>Earlier this year, evidence of ritual activity was discovered on the hills overlooking the Meon Valley, near Southampton. Wax had been dripped on to the ground from candles and, buried in a circle, investigators uncovered 12 dead rats. Meon Valley police immediately contacted Graham King at the Museum Of Witchcraft for advice. Inspector Shaun Moore of Meon Valley police says: \"We are concerned it might lead to something.\" The headline in the Southern Daily Echo (and it was a big one) read, \"Occult Probe\". Shock and horror! Wax drips and dead rats. </p> <p>Unfortunately, discrimination against Wiccans and pagans is alive and well, tinged with ignorance and paranoia. Drama teacher Ralph Morse was recently suspended from his job at Shenfield high school in Essex after admitting to being youth officer for the Pagan Federation and a practising witch (he was later reinstated). The school's headteacher, John Fairhurst, issued a statement saying, \"We completely and unequivocally reject their world of witchcraft and magic.\" Rands was asked to leave her post as a nanny after her journalist employer accused her of using witchcraft to \"steal the children\". </p> <p>In the US, things are even worse. Despite a constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and religion, Harry Potter (our own dear HP!) is banned in schools in Kansas and Colorado for promoting witchcraft. (The rows of chain stores and discount outlets piled high with pointy Hallowe'en hats and broomsticks are okay, though. That's just business.) </p> <p>Thankfully, witches appear not to have returned the religious bigotry. Having made the journey from Catholic to witch, Rands insists, \"there's not much distance between them. They share the same sense of ritual.\" Graham King goes further: \"I would have no trouble invoking Christ. I would visualise him and ask for his assistance. I don't think he's the son of God, but he's a pretty good witch.\" </p> <p> The next decade could see Wicca completely throw off its associations with the occult (\"occult\" means hidden) and go mainstream. Which would no doubt please its founder, Gerald Gardner (1883-1964). Claiming to have been initiated in the \"Old Ways\" by a crone named Dorothy Clutterbuck in the New Forest in 1939, Gardner published Witchcraft Today soon after the repeal of the Witchcraft Act in 1951 and effectively founded what has become Wicca, the witches' religion. In Witchcraft Today, Gardner laid out the eight sabbats, or Wiccan festivals, an amalgam of the old pagan solstices and equinoxes and the Celtic nature festivals of Imbolc (Candlemas), Beltane (May Day), Lammas (beginning of August) and Samhain (All Hallow's Eve). </p> <p>A mildly eccentric ex-colonial civil servant whose influences ranged from Hinduism to folk magic to freemasonry, Gardner conceived of a celebratory religion whose focus was on the power of the natural world. Wiccan rituals generally begin with the drawing of a magic circle, offerings to the elements and the four directions, and continue with a series of rituals, incantations and chants whose power rests in the symbolic marriage of male and female. But does that amount to a religion? Vivianne Crowley says it does: \"A religion is a set of ritual acts and practices invoking or calling up the divine. By that definition, Wicca is undoubtedly a religion.\" </p> <p>One problem with Gardner's work, however, was that, in order to give Wicca the authority he felt it deserved, he couched its rituals and incantations in purple prose, stuffing in grandiose archaisms wherever he could fit them, so that, to the unconvinced, Wicca can seem rather absurd, all thees and thous and thereforeuntos. Even the Wiccan salutation - Blessed Be - is tinged with hey-nonny-no. </p> <p>Another problem is that Gardner appears to have been a bit of a perv. It was he who introduced into Wiccan ritual scourging, the practice of using flails or whips lightly to scourge the skin as an aid to concentration. This idea was not new - some Hindu and Christian sects still practise it - but there was no evidence that it had ever been part of witchcraft traditions. And his ideas about working \"skyclad\" or naked also raised some eyebrows. \"Yes, Gardner probably was a dirty old man and virtually illiterate and, no, there is no evidence for scourges elsewhere in any witchcraft literature,\" admits Graham King. </p> <p>Neither of these things appears to have put Wiccans off. \"Wicca is a surprisingly modern religion that draws on some ancient ideas,\" insists Crowley. \"Wicca venerates nature, and is associated with vegetarianism and animal rights. Its feminism and emphasis on individual responsibility matches people's perception of the world.\" </p> <p>But, I say, nudity, magic, the mysteries of nature, it's all a bit un-British, isn't it? On the contrary, says Ronald Hutton, professor of history at Bristol University. \"Wicca is very British - English, actually. We are the first nation to have industrialised and to have been acutely cut off from the natural world. Wicca is a response to that, a countercultural religion allowing people to link back with the land.\" </p> <p>A product of our history it may be, but does Wicca have a future? Since its inception 50 years ago, it has branched off and taken on local flavours. There are now radical feminist, gay and all-male Wiccan groups. \"Wicca is going through radical changes at the moment because of its growth,\" says Crowley. \"There's a much wider range of people now, and a lot of those getting involved are not seeking the occult but a modern spiritual practice. They're attracted to participatory ritual, and there's a hunger for a spiritual system that enhances lives by bringing about an inner change. And Wicca is celebratory.\" </p> <p>Wiccans themselves are optimistic. As Crowley says, \"Wicca has no paid leadership, no buildings, no capital: it's like a huge voluntary group, but it's survived 50 years.\" Professor Hutton, himself a druid, agrees: \"The fact that Wicca is a mystery religion and includes nudity and initiation rites means it will always shock the mainstream, but I think it will persist. Wicca is having a strong influence on rave and rock culture, eco-pagans and road protesters. The correspondence between magic and virtual reality means it also appeals to infotech workers. It's a religion for self-employed and self-reliant people, artisans and individualists, and it is currently finding its role as the clergy or inner ring to these groups. The 90s saw a remarkable pulling together of all the pagan strands.\" </p> <p>No one I spoke to had any ideas about the tarantula and the crow, by the way. The woman in my local pet shop wasn't missing a tarantula, though she pointed out that they are great escape artists. So I've decided the tarantula was a runaway pet. But as for the crow, well, I really don't know what to think about the crow</p>",
  "Germany had just surrendered, the war against Japan was still going on, London and many other British cities were covered in rubble. But John Maynard Keynes wanted the country to know that those who cared about such things were taking steps to ensure that the brave new postwar world would not only have new social and economic policies, but something hitherto unheard of in British history: a cultural policy. <p> \"I do not believe it is yet realised what an important thing has happened. State patronage of the arts has crept in. It has happened in a very English, informal, unostentatious way - half-baked. A semi-independent body is provided with modest funds.\" It was with these words that listeners to the BBC were informed in July 1945 of the creation of the Arts Council. The tensions which were to dog the Arts Council throughout its history were evident in the very terms of Keynes's celebratory remarks. 'Access' was to be in competition with 'excellence'; culture was at once lodged in the past as 'heritage', but also located in creative and participatory activities in the present.</p> <p> And aims were mixed in other ways, too: Keynes spoke of the need \"to make London a great artistic metropolis\", but also pledged the new body to \"let every part of Merry England be merry in its own way\" (the grand-opera-plus-morris-dancers view of 'culture'). The only really unequivocal statement was Keynes's cry from the heart interjected in the middle of his broadcast (and which no official spokesperson for the arts would dare to utter these days): \"Death to Hollywood.\"</p> <p> The history of the Arts Council is important not just because it became the main funding body for the arts, but because it functioned as a kind of microcosm of the relation between politics and culture in Britain in the second half of the 20th century. At first, the 'culture' it fostered largely corresponded to the traditional tastes of the cultivated elite; then in the 1960s and 70s, it attempted to do right by various forms of 'popular' culture; finally, in the 1980s and 90s it fell in with the prevailing economism of public discourse, treating culture as one of the 'leisure industries' which contributed to the GNP - or as the Thatcher-appointed Arts Council chairman, William Rees-Mogg, put it in 1985: \"The arts are to British tourism what the sun is to Spain.\"</p> <p> These developments were conditioned by social attitudes towards culture which had deep historical roots. Summarising ruthlessly, one might say that the dominant tradition in Britain had been an uneasy mixture of indifference, suspicion, and the largely unreflective perpetuation of the tastes of the traditional upper class. It has often been argued, most influentially by Matthew Arnold in the mid-19th century, that the pervasive impact of Protestantism, especially in its Puritan form, and the power of the commercial middle class in the world's first industrial nation combined to produce a suspicion of, or resistance to, culture that deserved to be called 'philistine'. But Britain's traditional elites, too, contributed to this uneasy relationship. The court and the metropolis were less the focus of upper class cultural life than in some other European countries; the landed classes tended rather to be provincial in their attachments and rural in their pursuits. </p> <p> It is true, of course, that historically most of the 'high art' forms were dependent upon the patronage of the wealthy classes, but in Britain even these were (and perhaps still are) primarily pursued as conventional elements in an established social season: where a visit to the opera at Covent Garden might be seen in much the same light as a cricket match at Lords or the regatta at Henley. This in turn helped to fortify popular hostility to these art forms and, although the labour movement's high regard for education has left its monuments in the statute-book in the form of public provision of schools and libraries, the arts have only attracted limited attention from the chief reforming governments of this century. </p> <p> Seen against this historical backdrop, the long absence in Britain of any kind of 'Ministry of Culture' is hardly surprising. In place of a 'cultural policy', Britain has had a miscellaneous collection of cultural institutions, with varying degrees of status and public support, whose operation has depended upon the shared values, social contacts and tacit agreements among leading members of the social and professional elites. Anything more explicit or systematic threatened to grate on those British sensibilities which detected a totalitarian resonance even to the phrase 'Ministry of Culture'. As Lord Goodman, the then Chairman of the Arts Council, drily remarked in the 1960s: \"One of the most precious freedoms of the British is freedom from culture.\"</p> <p> Prior to the second world war, the only public provision of culture took the form of the central government's responsibility for certain major museums and art galleries. The first steps towards the public provision for 'the arts' were prompted by a concern for the morale of the civilian population during the conflict itself. The Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts was set up in 1940; it was initially intended both to assist people to perform music and drama for themselves and to make the work of professional performers more widely accessible, though the latter aim soon predominated. In 1945 the warm glow of victory led many wartime expedients to be looked upon with favour, and all political parties concurred in transforming CEMA into the Arts Council. The establishment of the Arts Council may have represented a significant extension of the 'range' of activities receiving public support, but the 'means' adopted conformed to an established British pattern.</p> <p> The guiding principle remained that of 'arm's length' administration: that is, a system where public funds were not disbursed directly by a government department, as in most other European states, but were allocated to intermediate bodies which were charged with fulfilling certain public obligations - usually phrased in very general terms - and then left free to disburse the funds as they saw fit. </p> <p> As far as Westminster and Whitehall were concerned, both the level of political attention given to the arts and the size of the sums involved remained negligible for at least the first two decades after 1945. But then in 1965 the Labour government signalled its intention of pushing the topic up the political agenda by appointing a junior minister with special responsibility for the arts. In practice, subsequent governments, especially Conservative ones, tended to resist any expansion of the power and prestige of this office: the Arts portfolio was shuffled around various ministries, never commanding a ministry of its own, and so the minister concerned was in a correspondingly weak position when negotiating with the Treasury for an increase in its spending powers. </p> <p> Until 1992, the Arts Minister headed the Office of Arts and Libraries; it was a junior post which did not bring membership of the Cabinet. Inevitably in recent decades, with the heightened political profile of conservation and 'heritage' issues, with the greatly increased political clout of the 'tourist industry', and with the alleged economic benefits of a thriving 'arts sector', numerous issues which might in other countries be classified as the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture have come under the supervision and sometimes the control of government. But administratively these responsibilities remained dispersed until very recently. Thus, the Foreign Office oversaw the work of the British Council, the body whose task is to disseminate British culture abroad. The Department of the Environment was responsible for various historic buildings and other sites of national interest. The Home Office had overall responsibility for radio and television, though the cinema fell under the Department of Trade and Industry, while the Office of Arts and Libraries was administratively in the charge of the Lord President of the Council, having previously been under the Department of Education and Science.</p> <p> Some may see in this a wise Burkean system of internal checks and balances in which no one department has a monopoly of 'cultural policy'; others may see it as a characteristic muddle, only tolerated because the British have traditionally not taken 'culture' seriously enough to merit the formulation of effective procedures and policies for its support. From its beginnings, the Arts Council was subject to criticism from various quarters, especially on the grounds of its being too 'elitist' and taking too narrow a view of its functions. But there were also mounting misgivings about the way in which the council operated, and critics on both the left and the right of the political spectrum urged that its freedom be curtailed (generally urged by the right) or its constitution be altered (generally urged by the left). Neither the process of appointment to the main council and its panels nor the funding decisions they took were open to any kind of democratic control: much appeared to depend upon the close social links between members of the metropolitan elite.</p> <p> In this vein, it has been suggested that the reason why the independence of such bodies as the Arts Council involved no great tension with successive governments until the 1980s was that the members of these bodies so deeply shared the attitudes and values of the traditional political class. In the 1960s and 70s, as part of wider social changes, the council came under pressure to take a more democratic or popular view of the cultural activities that should be funded. To a limited extent the council did extend the range of its clients, though one of the main consequences is that it came under further criticism from Tory backbenchers who complained that public money was being used to support 'indecent', 'subversive', or simply 'mediocre' artistic activities. In fact, it is clear that for some time now the Arts Council has uncomfortably juggled various, not always consistent, criteria in making its decisions. </p> <p> In the mid-1980s, under Rees-Mogg, it thumpingly declared its commitment to 'excellence', but taken narrowly this was always bound to conflict with the council\u00cds duty, as laid down in its charter, \"to increase the accessibility of the arts to the public throughout Great Britain\". The relative autonomy accorded to the Regional Arts Councils further complicated the picture, since they tended to look more favourably on a variety of 'community' or participatory activities than had the parent council. Although the big cultural satrapies such as Covent Garden, ENO, the National Theatre and the RSC were always its major clients, the overwhelming bulk of the support provided by the council was in smaller grants to a huge variety of organisations - dance companies, local theatres, individual writers, poetry magazines, crafts associations, and so on. </p> <p> The Thatcher governments of the 1980s exercised one obvious kind of influence by their reductions in the real value of the arts budget, but they also exercised a more insidious influence by manipulating the system of appointments to the relevant public bodies along simple partisan lines. Thus, for example, in 1980, shortly after the Tories had taken power, the self-made businessman Alastair McAlpine was nominated for membership of the Arts Council. There was immediate protest, since not only did McAlpine have no obvious qualifications or experience in the arts world, but he had already noisily expressed his opposition to any public subsidy to the arts. The protest was overridden by the arts minister's revelation that \"this nomination comes from a very high source\"; McAlpine has been one of Mrs Thatcher's closest supporters and a fervent advocate of 'free-market' policies. </p> <p> Then in 1982 Richard Hoggart, a literary and cultural critic with a distinguished career in education (and a man of moderate Guardian-reading leftwing views) who had for some years served very effectively as vice-chairman of the Arts Council, was abruptly dismissed. This was contrary to established practice and against the stated wishes of the chairman and the rest of the council. When pressed, the (Tory) arts minister confessed it was because \"Number 10 doesn't like him\". Rees-Mogg was appointed as chairman the following year. When Roy Shaw, the long-serving secretary-general of the Arts Council, retired later the same year, he wrote an article for the council's Bulletin regretting this increasing politicisation of appointments. Rees-Mogg attempted to prevent the publication of the article, which only led to its receiving vastly greater publicity by its appearance in the Observer. </p> <p> The official view in the closing decades of the century was that any shortfalls in public provision would soon be made up by private sponsorship, but the problems with this assumption have become increasingly clear. Sponsorship is another form of advertising, and thus introduces its own demands, whether in the form of opera programmes printed in the colours of a well-known cigarette company or, more worryingly, of pressures towards 'safe' and uncontroversial events. The one new ministry set up by John Major after his election victory in 1992 was the Department of National Heritage, embracing tourism, sport and the arts. The title aptly reflected the prime minister's sepia-tinted views: village greens and country houses are part of the nation's 'heritage', experimental theatre and minimalist art are not.</p> <p> In practice, what really transformed the relation of government to the arts were the huge yields from the new national lottery. The capital infrastructure of culture became heavily dependent on what Adam Smith famously described as \"a tax on ignorance\"; regular funding channelled through the Arts Council was now only part of the story. After Labour's victory in 1997, the title 'the Ministry of Culture' was finally established. It retains broadly the same heterogeneous remit, which reflects the current deep confusion about the distinctive nature and value of art. In so far as there is an organising principle, it is economic: these activities are grouped together as a category of 'optional' consumer choices, they are 'leisure industries'. By the end of the 20th century, costume dramas had become the emblematic 'product', milking heritage to help the export drive. 'Death to Hollywood' has mutated into 'long live Merchant Ivory'.</p> <p> Broadly speaking, therefore, what has happened is that one, largely extraneous and inherited, form of confidence has been eroded without being replaced by another which would allow discriminations of quality to be persuasively made on intrinsic rather than merely instrumental grounds. We are now encouraged to think of works of art not as expressing some of the deepest probings of the human condition, but as leisure products whose 're-branding' will contribute to 'national competitiveness'. While this is the prevailing official ethos, we had perhaps better hope that the familiar lack of a 'cultural policy' in Britain continues, thereby at least allowing a little genuine creative expression to be fostered in the cracks.</p> <p> <b> What the men in suits said about the state of British culture:</b><br></p> <p><b>1946</b><br> \"By provision of concert halls, modern libraries, theatres and suitable centres we desire to assure our people full access to the great heritage of culture in this nation...

  "Half of them either are - or will be - graduates. Behind them stands a 20-year tradition of national debate with all the associated fluttering futility of white papers and annual education acts. Every summer they and their schools were league-tabled and categorised to within an inch of their project-led lives as they clutched their folders and did their field work. Ministers - Tory and Labour - acclaimed the dizzying rise in their exam results. Never have so many been assessed by so many, and to such congratulatory effect. All the boxes were ticked for understanding, creativity and empathy. <p> The only problem is that Britain's 18- to 24-year-olds - our GCSE generation - seem rather ignorant. They may have their neuroses. Only 47% can identify Sigmund Freud as a psychiatrist. Lucian painted in vain; while the poet laureate's evocation of the Queen Mother's hats has passed them by. Whether profound or trivial, for young Britannia, the cultural happens to other people. Perhaps youth is another country where they do things differently. Perhaps behind this litany of ignorance there lurks a parallel universe of excitingly contemporary artistic relevance that escapes this particular scrutiny. Perhaps the GCSE-ites are more interested in the glories of mute Miltons who lurk outside the net of the Great Tradition. Yet, two-thirds of them can't even identify JK Rowling as the author of Harry Potter.</p> <p> The most bleak conclusions of ICM's cultural poll relate to the canonic: to events, authors, discoveries and achievements which seem so fundamental that you don't need to check that they're still remembered. That is why the poll shocks. The causes behind this modern Dunciad's arrival are many. The stale old English cocktail of class and education always did reserve culture for the few. But there are some modern kicks in it these days. There's the ease of the left-right consensus which lies behind the modern British philistinism in education and all that noisy Benthamite busybodyism. On the left there's the fear that canonised excellence always reflects a petrified authoritarianism. On the right there's been a parallel paranoia: the pursuit of 'relevance' and the invention of a regulatory state in the name of educational 'market forces'. Both have created rootlessness and ignorance.</p> <p> In Russia, 10-year-olds learn Lermontov's Borodino by heart; 90% of Britain's young adults can't identify Waterloo as the main conflict of 1815. Perhaps national suffering is a better nurse of culture than GDP contentment. But why should this cultural deracination matter? A fact is a stubborn thing, wonderful in its power to puncture pretension and deflate a theory. Our mass entertainment culture has been good at spreading materialistic egalitarianism. The stuffiness of the old hierarchies have gone. But in its place has arrived a glibness, an ability to talk a good game, and the talent to ape the chat-show presenter and the confessionalist interviewee. Getting away with it and larging it are now important national characteristics. Killer facts are lethal blows against the glib bullshitter. But knowing elementary things about who, where and when becomes a rare virtue. </p> <p> This knowledge is important because it both humbles and inspires. To know what others have achieved is to recognise genius and glimpse self-sacrifice. It provides a scale, rather than a dispiriting shadow cast by the past on the present. If Dickens and Shakespeare, Cromwell and Chaucer, Pankhurst and Livingstone, are literally less than names to you then you're cut off from a whole world of possibility and of emancipation. Marooned on an island where only the urgently evanescent matters, the cultural amnesiac loses direction. Discrimination drops away. It's a significant moment of opportunity for charlatans to peddle their wares; for the meretricious, the bogus and the derivative in art and politics alike. Knowledge means the power to say no, and the ability to give reasons for the rejection. </p> <p> It matters that 93% can't identify Paradise Lost as Milton's most famous poem. Milton is our second greatest poet, without Shakespeare's irritatingly burlesque fondness for the easy pun and pointless wordplay. But ignorance about the poet who is also our greatest republican carries an even higher price than aesthetic loss. Only one in five of the 18- to 24-year-olds could identify the two sides in the English Civil War, and Tom Paine's Rights of Man failed to register with a miserable 94%. The loss of a tradition of defiance and rebellion makes for passivity. </p> <p> England is a notoriously non-political country. The same craze for personality which leads us to be more interested in the lives of artists than in their achievements means that our politics is conducted in terms of biography. It's been an important aspect of the Blair premiership. That once-fabled power to emote at the drop of a hat had a special appeal to a generation for whom history is an aspect of empathy rather than an exercise in knowledge and criticism. There are some forms of naivety which are more dangerous than charming. Ignorance of 1900-45 prime ministers means that you can neither name and shame nor extol those who for good or ill helped make the world you live in now. This is not a matter of fusty antiquarianism. Innocence of Bonar Law's existence is a bearable condition, perhaps even of the Marquess of Salisbury's. But Lloyd George, the creator of the Welfare State, and Neville Chamberlain, the architect of Appeasement, are in a different league. </p> <p> Young Britain offers a combination of residual Churchillianism (whose wartime leadership was identified by 30% of the age cohort) and Fat Boy Slimmery (whose peacetime disc-jockeydom is known to 93% of them); apathy, therefore, with a youthful and capitalist face. The age of information overload is also the age of culpable ignorance. More has, truly, meant less. The past is not an authoritarian domain, despite the best conservative attempts at inventing a nationalised, homogenised culture. Ignorance of past struggle is an important source of mental slavery to outworn dogma. History in Britain was once a Whiggish, providentialist and insular story of deliverance by pragmatism, property rights and Protestantism: Magna Carta as the founding stone of constitutional liberty; the Domesday Book as the result of the last successful invasion. </p> <p> Revisionists now resile. We know now that the 13th-century parliament owed more to a baronial grab for power than to some protodemocratic zeal. Every healthy culture winnows and chooses a past which it finds useful. But something has been lost. In order to revise you need to know something to begin with. The historian and the critic are the beneficiaries of what they can kick against. But the consequence of kicking against the traces is a generation whose minds are more empty than open. Medieval England, in particular, has disappeared off the map - part of a general loss of Britishness in a devolutionary age. But it helps to understand our present European debate if we know that Chaucer thought as naturally in French as in English, that Angles, Saxons and Franks are all, in origin, Germanic tribes. </p> <p> It was always a large hope that knowledge leads to liberty, that the better informed are also the tolerant and compassionate. That project of the 18th-century, Enlightenment, has suffered its 20th-century blows. But without some kind of version of that hope it is difficult to see why education and culture are worth doing at all. 'Compare and contrast' seems an instruction from an educational Dark Ages. But the ability to do just that lies at the heart of all cultural progress and debate. Britten looks back to Purcell - and recognition of that fact makes for a better appreciation of both. Bach's partitas and Chopin's mazurkas become even greater achievements if we know the form they mastered and transcended. The shock of the new is only a shock if you know what went before. Context and memory, if not all, are still quite a lot when it comes to the best that has been thought and done.</p> <p>\u0095 Hywel Williams is the author of Guilty Men: Conservative Decline and Fall (Aurum, \u00a319.95).
