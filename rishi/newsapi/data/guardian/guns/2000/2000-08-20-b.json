  "Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, last night called for an RUC report into the spate of incidents in loyalist areas of Belfast. <p>His intervention came after Adam Ingram, the Northern Ireland security minister, met the RUC deputy chief constable, Colin Cramphorn, and senior security advisers to discuss the worsening situation of sectarian violence. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson said: \"This behaviour risks sparking escalating violence. I have asked the RUC for a further report on every aspect of yesterday's disturbing events. Police investigations continue into a range of incidents and I expect to receive their full assessment shortly. I will then decide what further action is required.\" </p> <p>Mr Mandelson appealed to loyalist paramilitaries to end the violent attacks and the destruction of property. \"It is very important that those with influence in the community use it to bring an end to this violence. I call on them to do so.\" </p> <p>A man shot dead in a street attack in Dundalk, Co Louth, in the Irish Republic, was last night named by police. Nicholas O'Hare, 35, was shot by two gunmen on Saturday night in an incident thought to be linked to the shooting in the same area, last month, of a publican Stephen Connolly. </p> <p>Mr O'Hare, who lived in Dundalk, was known to police and was suspected of being involved in a protection racket aimed at Mr Connolly's bar. He had served a jail term for arms possession, and was completing a suspended sentence for assaulting a police officer. </p> <p>Speculation at the time of Mr Connolly's death indicated he had been shot for refusing to pay IR\u00a3500 (\u00a3386) a week protection money to a Dundalk gang. </p> <p>Mr O'Hare's murder came as the government condemned violence in the Shankill Road area of Belfast at the weekend, in which 10 people were hurt in loyalist gun attacks. </p> <p>More than a dozen houses were damaged during disturbances in the north and west of the city. Loyalist gunmen opened fire at the Rex bar on Shankill Road during a paramilitary parade on Saturday. Three people were injured in the shooting and seven more were hurt in shootings later on Saturday night and yesterday. </p> <p>At least 16 shots were fired into a house on Ambleside street, which is the family home of the senior Progressive Unionist party politician Billy Hutchinson. The North Belfast assembly member said he feared the escalating feud between the Ulster Volunteer Force, the Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Loyalist Volunteer Force would have \"serious consequences\". </p> <p>\"It is going to end in death. These people attacked this home behind us. These are innocent people. They were out at their work. If they hadn't been at work at 1am they would have been shot dead.\" </p> <p>The home of Gusty Spence, the former UVF commander in the Maze prison was also attacked. Mr Spence said \"honest, decent people\" were being caught in the violence and appealed to the paramilitaries not to take the country back to the \"dark days of violence\".</p>",
  "Valentina Avelene never wanted her son to go into the navy. When Sergei got his call-up papers for compulsory military service last autumn, she begged him not to go, and tried to persuade him to hide at his grandmother's house for a few months to escape conscription. <p>But Sergei Vitchenko, 20, was determined to serve his country and refused to listen to his mother's entreaties. He was delighted when he was dispatched this year to take part in perhaps the most prestigious mission possible within the Russian navy, serving on the country's most sophisticated nuclear submarine cruiser, the Kursk. </p> <p>The conscript Vitchenko was the lowest ranking member of the crew and struggled to be promoted to the position of junior cook. He took pride in his work and his letters home expressed enthusiasm for his new life. </p> <p>As Mrs Avelene made her way yesterday to join the relatives' vigil within the closed military town of Vidyayevo - the headquarters of the Kursk command - she gripped two letters which could be the last words to come out of the doomed submarine - a letter from her son and another from the captain. Sergei's letter arrived a her home in a small country town in Lithuania nine days ago, the day the Kursk went down. </p> <p>The letter, written on four sheets torn out from a child's lined exercise book, gives the impressions of a young submariner experiencing conditions on board a nuclear cruiser. </p> <p>For almost a week after the vessel sank, Mrs Avelene was too worried to sleep or do anything except stare at the television, waiting for news. But yesterday, despite her profound exhaustion, the act of reading aloud her son's last words to her gave her momentary release from her anguish - prompting her first to smile and then to laugh. The worst is that she still thinks her son is alive. </p> <p>\"Dear Mama and Papa Thomas,\" Sergei began the letter to his mother and his stepfather. \"I have received all your letters. I'm sorry I haven't written for such a long time. We were at sea but now we are sitting in the port, loading up rockets. \" </p> <p>Sergei went on to describe his pride at having earned his colours as a true submariner, after his first descent with the Kursk to the bottom of the sea. </p> <p>Apologising for her son's poor handwriting, his grammatical errors and his liberal use of Russian slang, Mrs Avelene, 43, read on: \"We were baptised as submariners - we were called to the command post where everybody drank a cup of sea water and kissed a greased ship's hammer - and then we got these papers and the commander shook everyone's hands. But after drinking the sea water, we all felt a bit sick.\" </p> <p>He told his mother his next trip to sea would be over by the end of August, when he would return to land - and promised to take some pictures of the scenery for her, so she would get an idea of his surroundings. The letter, written on July 23 - just before the submarine embarked on its final journey - ends with another proud reference to his new job: \"Bye, I love you. I miss you. Write to me, Seryozha (a cook).\" </p> <p>Carefully folded alongside this letter, Mrs Avelene has also preserved a letter she received from the submarine's captain, Gennady Lyachin, in May, informing her that her son was serving on the Kursk and praising his progress during his first few months on board. </p> <p>This, too, is handwritten on cheap, rough brown paper. The absence of a typewriter, let alone a computer, is a chilling reminder of the low-tech world in which the captain of one of Russia's most advanced submarines was working. </p> <p>\"The command informs you that your son, sailor Vitchenko Sergei Alexandrovich, is currently serving in the Russian military navy on the nuclear missile submarine Kursk, one of the most modern, battle-capable vessels not only of Russia but of the whole world,\" the captain wrote. </p> <p>Mrs Avelene proudly read on: \"Your son, sailor Vitchenko, has started to grasp his job with interest and dedication. I am certain that for the rest of his life your son will bear the highly respected badge of a Russian submariner with pride, dignity, and honour.\" </p> <p>The letter was signed: \"With my best wishes, Commander of the of the nuclear submarine cruiser, Kursk, Captain G Lyachin.\" </p> <p>Captain Lyachin is believed to have died almost instantly alongside all his senior officers on the Kursk when the vessel's control room exploded and water gushed into the submarine. </p> <p>Mrs Avelene, a builder, arrived in the Arctic town of Murmansk on Saturday after colleagues at the construction firm where she works collected enough money to pay for her plane ticket. She had been unable to afford the fare, and the Russian military had offered no financial support. </p> <p>She was waiting at the railway station yesterday for her daughter to arrive from St Petersburg; naval officials were then to take them to join the 208 other Kursk relatives gathered in Vidyayevo - among them 49 wives, seven fianc\u00e9es, 42 mothers, 11 brothers, 16 sisters and 39 children. </p> <p>In the face of all evidence to the contrary, Mrs Avelene was clinging to the hope that her son is still alive. </p> <p>\"I just want everything to be all right,\" she said. \"I want my son back - whatever condition he is in. I know we can look after him and help him to get better. </p> <p>\"All my hope is now with the British rescuers and the Norwegians. I'm very happy that they have come to the rescue. They are working heart and soul to help our men. They feel for them far more than our own officials do.\" </p> <p>Mixed in with this desperate, doomed expression of hope, was her deeply felt bitterness at the response of the Russian government and the military to the crisis. </p> <p>She was horrified by the Kremlin's initial refusal of foreign assistance in the rescue operation. \"I'd like to see [President Vladimir] Putin put in a boat and sent to the bottom of the sea - to experience what they went through,\" she said, suddenly overcome with anger. </p> <p>\"People get punished when they betray their country. But what if a country betrays its people?\" </p> <p>She was also dismayed by the lack of support from the military. Her family heard the news of the sinking on the radio late on Sunday evening; early on Monday they sent a telegram to the naval headquarters trying to establish if Sergei had been on board. </p> <p>They received no answer. Mrs Avelene spent hours trying to get through to an emer gency hotline, but failed because the number was always engaged. </p> <p>Finally she saw her son's name listed on television as one of the trapped men. No official had made any attempt to contact her. </p> <p>Looking weary and dazed yesterday, Mrs Avelene insisted that she refused to abandon hope. </p> <p>\"I'm going out of my mind with worry; but I keep asking Seryozha to hold on and not give up until the end.\" </p> <p> <b>Sailor's letter</b></p> <p>Dear Mama and Papa Thomas, </p> <p>I have received all your letters. I'm sorry I haven't written for such a long time and that I am replying so late. We were at sea and now we are sitting in the port, loading up rockets. When we have done this we will go out to sea again and then we will return to Severomorsk for the military parade. Tomorrow I will try to send this letter. </p> <p>Everything is fine with me; they finally accepted me to work in the ship's mess and so now I'm working as a cook and not in the cargo room. </p> <p>I have just hurried to prepare lunch so now I've got an hour's free time. The cooks are a privileged class on the ship - we are allowed to wash every day and we get to sleep for 12 hours at night. </p> <p>Tell me what the commander's letter said - what did he write to you about? I'm interested to know._ </p> <p>Congratulations on passing your driving test. So can you really drive a car now? To be honest, Mama, I can't imagine you at the driving seat. I can't wait for you to send me a picture of you behind the wheel. </p> <p>When we arrive back at base, I will write to everyone. But I think we will be at sea until the end of August. </p> <p>I have been awarded my submariner certificate. We were down at about 100 metres, but that's by no means the deepest our boat can go - even 480 metres is no problem. Later I'll try somehow to send this certificate home for you to keep as a souvenir. </p> <p>We were baptised as submariners - we were called to the command post where everybody drank a cup of sea water and kissed a greased ship's hammer - and then we got these papers and the commander shook everyone's hands. But after drinking the sea water, we all felt a bit sick. </p> <p>When we come back from the sea I will take some photos and then you can see where I have been serving. </p> <p>Well, I have probably already begun to bore you all with my letter, so I'll stop. </p> <p>Bye, I love you. I miss you. Write to me, </p> <p>Seryozha (a cook) </p> <p><b>Captain's letter</b></p> <p>Dear Valentina Avelene, </p> <p>The command informs you that your son, sailor Vitchenko Sergei Alexandrovich, is currently serving in the Russian military navy on the nuclear missile submarine Kursk, one of the most modern, battle-capable vessels not only of Russia but of the whole world. </p> <p>Your son, sailor Vitchenko, has started to grasp his job as cargo-room mechanic specialist with interest and dedication. The crew is giving him all the necessary help. The command is certain that he will swiftly learn his duties. I am certain that for the rest of his life your son will bear the highly respected badge of a Russian submariner with pride, dignity, and honour. </p> <p>The command assures you that it is doing everything it can to ensure that your son's time in military service passes as smoothly as possible. </p> <p>With my best wishes, </p> <p>Commander of the nuclear submarine cruiser, Kursk, </p> <p>Captain G Lyachin</p>",
  "The conventional industrial wisdom, among employers and some trade unionists alike, used to be that women were more biddable workers and less militant than men. <p>That caricature was often proved wrong, but in one recent dispute after another - from the 1997 British Airways cabin crew strikes to the Hillingdon and Critchley Labels lockouts - it has been women who have set the pace in challenging the new industrial balance of power. </p> <p>The latest to bear out the trend is a small group of mainly women factory workers in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, who have been on strike for 16 weeks in an attempt to improve their \u00a3160-a-week pay packets. Last week, they defied a threat of the sack unless they returned to work. </p> <p>Standing on the picket line outside the Foframe picture frame factory - as all 11 remaining strikers do for their full 37 working week - Ann Oliphant said she thought \"women can be more determined than men, more awkward and stubborn\" when it came to tests of nerve. </p> <p>Ms Oliphant, who has worked at the factory for 27 years and has got by only by doing cleaning jobs in the evening, said of the firm's owner and managing director, Benjamin Perl: \"He always used tell us to claim benefits if we thought our pay was too low.\" </p> <p>Fifteen out of 21 Foframe production workers walked out in support of a claim for a 50p increase to their hourly rate of \u00a34.29, worth 12%, at the beginning of May after Mr Perl told their union, the GMB, that he could not afford to pay any rise because of low-cost foreign competition. The strike followed the loss of days off and other cash benefits. </p> <p>Since then, Mr Perl has made three offers of between 2% and 3%, five strikers have left to take other jobs and the strike has become the country's longest running industrial dispute. The strikers now say they would be prepared to settle for 4% - or \u00a36.40 a week. </p> <p>Mr Perl, who last week called the conciliation service Acas in for the third time after issuing the sacking threats, said such increases would drive his factory out of business. </p> <p>He rejects the GMB's calculation that his workers are paid 10p for making a picture frame which retails in Boots for \u00a313.50. The real figure, he said, was 60p. Pay any more and he would not be able to compete with Chinese imports, he said. In fact, he insisted, he was going to have to close the factory in six to eight weeks anyway - something the strikers say he has been threatening to do for years. </p> <p>Mr Perl said: \"The GMB has got a political agenda - they are trying to break a small man. The workers can't dictate to the boss what to pay. I love workers, I don't lay them off, I put them in packaging. But they have been involved in secondary picketing, they have picketed Boots - they have even had ex-miners demonstrating outside my house.\" </p> <p>The GMB rejects the accusations of political motivation and points to Mr Perl's longstanding friendship with and support for the local MP and former prime minister, John Major. Last month, Mr Major met the strikers - who describe him as having been \"very diplomatic and understanding\" - and wrote to Mr Perl afterwards to express his concern. </p> <p>Outside the factory, the strikers tried to persuade a truck driver delivering supplies to turn back - Parcelforce and several other large firms have stopped deliveries, but their work is being done by smaller owner-drivers. The driver told the women: \"I agree with your strike, but I've got my job to do.\" He called his boss on a mobile phone, smoked a rollup and then drove through, grimacing. </p> <p>Doreen Smith, one of the strikers' two stewards, was meanwhile relieved that last week's sacking threat - allowed under new legislation after eight weeks - failed. \"What Perl is doing is slow torture for the workforce - but he tried to break the backbone of the strike and it backfired,\" she said.</p>",
  "Al Gore, now installed as Democratic candidate for the US presidency, has more to worry about than just George W Bush. There is also a potential threat from a third-party candidate. Not from the Reform party, founded by Ross Perot but now hopelessly split, with two rival factions claiming its candidacy, but from Ralph Nader, the veteran consumer crusader, running now on a green ticket. <p>Some analysts warn that Nader could do serious damage to Gore, especially by bleeding off votes he needs to take California. </p> <p> Nader could have that kind of effect without coming anywhere near the success of Perot, who in 1992 took 19% of the popular vote - the largest share for any third-party candidate in the 20th century. Yet Perot failed even then to break the two-party mould, as he had hoped.</p> <p> The last third force to do that was the Republican party. In the exceptional crisis of the 1850s over slavery, the existing parties collapsed, allowing Abraham Lincoln to take the presidency in 1860 with only 39% of the popular vote and no support at all in 10 of the 33 states which then existed. </p> <p>After that, the system evolved precisely to make it hard for such disintegration to happen again. In the 20th century no third party - populist, progressive, socialist or communist - succeeded in mounting a serious challenge to the major parties. </p> <p>Nader - articulate, experienced and above all honest - hopes to equal or even surpass Perot's performance eight years ago. But to have that kind of popular effect he would need to win a majority of the popular vote in a populous state, such as California, Texas or New York, or even a middle-size state, such as Illinois or Ohio. He would also have to do it in a close-fought election. </p> <p>The American constitution stipulates that when the polls close on November 7, 540 members of an electoral college must meet to choose the president. This is usually a formality. But, as in any first-past-the-post election, if more than two candidates are contending, it is possible that no one will win more than half the vote. Only by custom and practice, not by law, do college members follow the popular vote in their states, since the whole idea of the electoral college was to modify the tyranny of majorities. </p> <p>Were Bush and Gore to win states with a roughly equal number of college votes, third-party intervention could be decisive. If a third-party candidate were to win states which gave him or her 40 votes in the electoral college, with Bush and Gore winning 250 each, the college could not elect a new president. </p> <p>In such a case, the House of Representatives would decide, with each Congress-person free to choose between the top two candidates in the college - in this case, Bush and Gore. That has only happened once - in 1824, when there were five major candidates - although the 1876 presidential election was finally decided only by a special federal commission. </p> <p>Fringe third parties always run candidates for president, but only two have made any national impact. In 1948, Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, running as an insurgent Democrat against Harry Truman, carried his own state plus Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi. Though Truman narrowly won that election, Thurmond's intervention revealed the strength of white southern resistance to affirmative action on civil rights and helped slow the pace of racial integration during the 1950s. </p> <p>Mindful of Thurmond's example, in 1968 Governor George Wallace of Alabama ran as an insurgent southern Democrat. He won the same states as Thurmond 20 years earlier and took 13% of the popular vote nationally. Wallace's support in southern cities was impressive, including more than a third of the vote in towns in Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee. Nixon just scraped into the White House, however. In 1972, Wallace did well in Democratic primaries in Maryland, Florida and Michigan, this last state revealing working-class support in the industrial north. He looked poised to surpass his 1968 performance until a madman shot him and ended his political career. </p> <p>Wallace was a dangerous racist demagogue who articulated the hopes, fears and grievances of millions of white Americans, the working poor in every community and state who felt excluded from conventional politics. These \"forgotten Americans\", lacking secure employment, health care and opportunity, resent the fact that they do not share in the abundance of American life and hate paying taxes for welfare they do not receive. Wallace paved the way for those \"Democrats for Reagan\" who, in the 1980s, finally brought to an end the Democratic coalition that had elected Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. </p> <p>What chance does Nader have in November of breaking the present political mould? Though history is a poor guide to political prediction, it would be very surprising if Nader made much impact. He is not speaking for \"forgotten Americans\" but for a minority of middle-class voters fed up with meaningless domestic politics. </p> <p>Perot's share of the vote in 1992 failed to carry a single state, and, by taking more votes from the older George Bush than from his then largely unknown opponent Bill Clinton, Perot helped Clinton's clever and eventually victorious campaign. Eight years later much depends on whether Nader can get himself on the ballot in every state. Even so, American protest voters look more likely to reveal themselves by failing to vote than by casting a protest vote for a third-party activist like Nader. </p> <p>\u0095 Patrick Renshaw is reader in American history at Sheffield University </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>When the American drama series thirtysomething was at its peak in the 1980s, a critic observed that the chronological title made the series naturally sequel-friendly. Where thirtysomething followed Hope, Michael, Ethan and the other yuppies through marriage, children and professional ambition, it was easy to imagine a fortysomething in which they got divorced, followed by decadal revisits (like John Updike's sequence of Rabbit novels) until seventysomething tracked them through retirement to the clinic and the grave. </p> <p>In fact, the 90s passed without a fortysomething but now thirtysomething creators Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz have delivered what is, thematically if not in terms of characters, an update. Sky One's Once and Again frequently looks and sounds like thirtysomething, with the difference that it's a post-marriage drama where the first series was a marriage one. </p> <p>Rick (Billy Campbell) is an architect and Lily (Sela Ward) a writer. Recent separation or divorce have not prevented them from maintaining cash-hungry homes, clothes and cars. When they meet at a school soccer match, love breaks above their heads like lightning. The opening episode relies heavily on the generational reverses which powered the comedy in Absolutely Fabulous. As Rick and Lily nervously prepare for a date, their teenage children warn them not to have sex before they really know each other. The parents' fumbling attempt to make love is subsequently interrupted when the children come home unexpectedly. </p> <p>For many watching, this is intended to be the comedy of recognition. Zwick and Herskovitz specialise in what might be called demographic television or mirror fiction. For most of the audience for one of their dramas, what you see is what you've got. They deliver a particular segment of consumers to a network by featuring glossy representatives of the target group - the professional middle-aged middle-classes - in a drama. It was fitting that Michael and Ethan in thirtysomething actually worked in advertising. </p> <p>Indeed, Zwick and Herskovitz's shows are best understood as compellingly extended advertisements. The people have just too much sheen; the houses always look as if the cleaner has just left after a marathon session. And as for the message they're selling, it's the very American one of redemption and endurance. Their most giveaway piece of typing was when they called the female lead in their biggest series Hope. In thirtysomething, plot-line crises - like adultery, cancer, redundancy, child illness - were all opportunities for the couples to reconnect with each other. </p> <p>In Once and Again, Rick and Lily have failed these reconnection tests, but the redemptive message is that sheer blinding romantic love is still possible for divorcees with children. </p> <p>The starting set-up of Once and Again is revealing of the creative team's Madison Avenue instincts. Just as characters in American ads get out of bed in the morning looking beautiful and manicured, so the couple in this drama are, essentially, lovestruck teenagers who just happen to have a wedding wreck behind them; or a tragic widow and widower whose spouses are still distantly alive in the background. This is vital to Once and Again's tone. Because if the central characters were a second-time couple who had left their partners to be together, there would be too great a risk of the audience judging them. </p> <p>The weakness of these creators - at least to English ears - has always been a certain Reagan-speechwriter cheesiness in their dialogue. Faced with a teenage daughter who considers herself ugly and unlovable and is frightened to go to a party, Lily counsels her: \"You are not the miscreant, ugly person you pass yourself off as... Did you ever stop to think that fear might be your friend?\" </p> <p>But the new show fixes Zwick &amp; Herskovitz's position in at least a backroom of US TV's hall of fame. One of the signature strengths of thirtysomething was a stylishness and visual ambition marked by things like the pretentious avoidance of capital letters in the title and the credits. </p> <p>This narrative flashiness is now routine in US TV - a standard episode of Ally McBeal resembles an especially daring one of thirtysomething in this respect - but Once and Again is lavish with its fantasy sequences and documentary pastiche. As Rick and his ex-wife bicker at parents' night over their son, he is suddenly ambushed by a black and white flashback to the ecstatic night of the child's conception. Between scenes, the central couple footnote their emotions and actions in grainily-shot conversation with an unseen interviewer. </p> <p>For those who've held on to the satellite dish or cable agreement after the divorce, and can watch Once and Again, the series will make an intriguing if uneasy coupling with BBC1's own autumn post-divorce show: an adaptation of Joanna Trollope's step-family novel Other People's Children. A useful point of distinction between British and American drama is that our shows tend to be admonitory where theirs are aspirational. </p> <p>British hits make you glad you don't lead the characters' lives. American successes are designed to make you wish that you did. Once and Again proves the point once again. </p> <p>Once and Again, Thursday, 9.30pm, Sky One.</p> <p><strong>What's in a name?</strong></p> <p>TV companies regularly send out press releases about series in production, but two recent media teasers from the BBC were unusually provisional in their information. </p> <p>The release about a new Stephen Poliakoff series Family Tree stressed that this was merely a \"working title\". And the PR details for another big new drama series described it as currently \"Untitled\". </p> <p>This isn't coincidental. The title of a TV series is thought to have ever more importance in drawing an audience in. Alternative monikers for projects are tried out on focus groups. But despite the attempt to turn titling into a science, it'll always involve luck, and there's always the possibility of bad clashes. (Director Stephen Daldry has just changed the name of his first movie from Dancer to Billy Reilly because of possible confusion with the hit film Dancer in the Dark.) </p> <p>And we can detect some trends in programme baptism in this week's schedules. Cousins (Wednesday, 8pm, BBC1), Dr Charlotte Uhlenbroek's series about primates, stands out as the first major wildlife series which gives no hint in its title that it involves animals. </p> <p>This is very much against the recent trend in television in which fears about the audience's intelligence and attention span have led series to wear simple designations like the lapel badges of delegates at a conference. Current examples of such simplicity include Brain Story (Tuesday, 9pm, BBC2) and Battle of Britain (Tuesday,10pm, ITV). </p> <p>The punning title - a favourite device - is represented by two shows playing on the names of well-known movies: Lamarr's Attacks (Thursday, 9.30pm, BBC2) and Phones, Robbers and Videotape (Wednesday, 10.15pm, BBC1). </p> <p>But the series which has the most subtle relationship with naming is still Friends (Friday, 9pm, C4). A main title of absolute descriptive simplicity is offset each week by a subtitle in which the writers amusingly play with the way in which fans talk about a show: this week \"The One Where Phoebe Runs\".</p>",
  "A Channel 4 film crew held in Liberia on suspicion of spying waited yesterday to hear whether they would face trial. <p>British director David Barrie, cameraman Tim Lambon, South African cameraman Gugulakhe Radebe, and Sierra Leonean film-maker Sorious Samura have been held in a police station in the capital Monrovia since Friday. They had arrived three weeks ago, working for a London company, Insight News Television, commissioned by Channel 4 for a political documentary series, Sorious Samura's Africa.</p> <p>Liberia's justice minister, Eddington Varmah, said they had \"engaged in acts against the security of the state\" and were arrested on suspicion of espionage. He accused them of trying to denigrate the president, Charles Taylor, and of assisting foreign powers in their diplomatic confrontation with Liberia through \"allegations of diamond smuggling, gun running, support to the RUF [Sierra Leone rebels] and human rights abuses\". Investigators had evidence that could be presented in court, he said.</p> <p>Channel 4 yesterday denied the allegations and stated that the crew, for whom it was \"deeply concerned\", were engaged in \"legitimate journalistic activities\". A spokesman said there was a strong possibility that a court hearing could take place as early as today, and that a Liberian lawyer had been engaged to represent the four in that event. He added that the crew had written permission to film from the ministry of information.</p> <p>The UK honorary consul visited the four on Saturday, and reported them fit and well.</p>",
  "Her decks were dangerously overloaded with soldiers and arms and the crew was unfamiliar with recently fitted gun ports, which had accidentally been left open. <p>The combination of these factors left the Mary Rose so unstable that an ill-timed gust of wind would have been enough to scupper her, a documentary will claim tonight. </p> <p>The unexplained sinking of Henry VIII's favourite battleship as she turned to fire on the French fleet in July 1545, while the king watched in horror from the shore, is one of maritime history's great mysteries. </p> <p>Now, new evidence assembled for Channel 4's Secrets of the Dead series suggests a series of errors caused the ship to plunge to the bottom of the Solent, where she remained until 1982. </p> <p>A new examination of the crewing formula used in Henry VIII's day suggests that contrary to previous assumptions, the Mary Rose may have been carrying up to 200 soldiers more than the 415 mariners, soldiers and gunners listed in the official logs. </p> <p>Crammed on to the ship's upper deck along with heavy cannons, they could have fatally shifted her centre of gravity. </p> <p>An analysis of tree rings in the ship's timber suggests that a major refit shortly before she set sail may also have played a part in her sinking. Studies by Christopher Dobbs, an archaeologist at the Mary Rose Trust in Portsmouth, and Martin Bridge of University College London suggest that the crew may have been unfamiliar with newly installed gun ports, not realising that water would flood in if they were left open as the ship turned. </p> <p>\"We've shown that one of the major timbers in the ship, very close to the gun ports, was put in in 1541 or later,\" said Mr Dobbs. \"This suggests, but does not prove, that the gun port too may have been put in at that time.\" </p> <p>This hypothesis is supported by a reconstruction of the moments immediately before the Mary Rose slipped beneath the waves. Tests on a scale model showed that overloading the vessel would have brought the gun ports dangerously close to the water line. A simple gust of wind could then have been enough to tip the vessel and allow water to flood in. </p> <p>Secrets of the Dead: What Sank the Mary Rose? is on Channel 4 tonight at 9pm.</p>",
  "<p>Who are the latest heroes of American television - successors to the battling cops of NYPD, the electrifying doctors of ER, the crusading lawyers of The Practice? When young people, deprived of potential military glory through long years of peace, testify to their higher idealism in public, what do they say? Well Hello, Mr Chips. </p> <p>America's teachers suddenly stand, at least in political legend, on the edge of the canyon called Hope. Teaching is suddenly the most wanted, most admired profession. The new television series - \"from the makers of Ally McBeal\" - is called Boston Public. It will be front-line stuff: gallant staff, big city problems, challenge, failure and heart-warming triumph mingled. The myths are in the making. </p> <p>And the politicians who help make those myths cluster, unusually enough, in the van of eulogy and change. Consider Al Gore. \"At a time when the amount of human knowledge is doubling every five years, we will do bold things to make our schools the best in the world. I will fight for the single greatest commitment to education since the GI bill ... It's time to treat and reward teachers like the professionals they are.\" </p> <p>Consider George W Bush. \"Education reform is empty if it does not take into account the needs of the educators. Teachers are not the object of education reform, they are the engine of education reform. They have a high calling, and we must respect it. As we ask more of teachers, we must do more to help them.\" </p> <p>Bush, moreover, doesn't just hymn \"excellent teachers\" - he covered the convention stage in Philadelphia with them, along with a mock classroom with real pupils where they could display their arts. Show as well as tell. Both he and Gore have decided that the big issue for November's election is education times three. Gore's dad was a teacher. Bush's wife was a teacher. Teachers are wonderful people. </p> <p>Pause and pinch yourself, for the schooling reality here is wholly familiar to any visiting Brit. Public schools - the ones we call state schools - are often fine in leafy suburbs, but much too often lousy in the urban ghettos and ethnic melting pots. Between 40% and 50% of poor kids can emerge from the public system as functional illiterates; 43% of maths teachers in high-poverty areas have no relevant qualifications. Sink schools that David Blunkett would consign to history in Deptford just potter along in Detroit. Eight years of Clinton prosperity have not closed that learning gap. In many ways, as the suburbs have grown leafier, it has opened wider. </p> <p>What's fascinating, though, isn't the similarity of the dilemma, but the difference in the rhetoric. When Bush denounces \"the soft bigotry of expectations, with too many children segregated into schools without standards, shuffled from grade to grade because of their age and regardless of their knowledge\", he doesn't blame the teachers. His targets, of course, are the local and federal bureaucrats who choke the system with their dogma and ineptitude. And though Gore talks warmly about \"more money, higher standards and accountability\", his litany of blame, too, passes the denizens of the classrooms by. </p> <p>The language they both use is curiously military. Gore \"fights away\" in the tradition of the GI bill. The Republican party manifesto platform pledges itself to \"improve teacher training and recruiting by expanding the troops-to-teachers programme, which places retired military personnel in the classroom\". This is a war, to be fought by war-like means in a war-like way. </p> <p> Let's put the respective generals' battle plans to one side. They aren't, in their myriad detail, too helpful. Gore sees pre-school education and better access to college places as the answer: Bush wants to dismantle local education authorities, give school heads supreme power and experiment with vouchers. Britain has mostly been here before - and will probably be here again. The real lesson from America is rather simpler than that. </p> <p>Both candidates talk standards and targets. Both men would tighten monitoring of what goes on behind the school gates. But both lead with more cash in teachers' wage packets as a symbol of their zeal: the front-end sweetener that Bush used in Texas. Both want the teachers on their side, and both know that recruiting and retaining good teachers is the key to success. </p> <p>I don't suppose that Mr Blunkett or Mr Blair - in some ways deeper into this forest - would dissent one jot over substance. On the contrary, they'd dust off their collected speeches and cite countless tributes to the vital role that teachers perform, as well (like George W) as lauding the wonders of merit pay. Yet emotionally the message sounds quite different. </p> <p>The voice of reform, for Blair as for Major before him, belongs to Chris Woodhead - and, inevitably, it is critical, censorious. Woodhead's team inspect schools, inspect teachers. They do an important job and, of course, they mix praise with blame; but they are not the cheerleaders of better times. They are bound to say \"Yes - but\". </p> <p>There are all manner of reasons that schoolteachers, in Britain as in America, don't enjoy the respect, the professional status, that the politicians allegedly seek for them - or the pay which, in either country, still mostly squats in the low \u00a320,000s. One reason, undoubtedly, is an attachment to a version of trade unionism too suspicious of change and too Gradgrind in its responses. Professionalism doesn't come that way. </p> <p>The United States has some school problems we rarely dream of. Not just gun massacres like Columbine, but crime against teachers - more than 1m thefts and 600,000 violent crimes in a five-year period. Its mountains to climb are far more precipitous. But the mood - however frail it ultimately proves - is determined and optimistic. And it begins by getting teachers on side. </p> <p>It woos them with more than cash and promises. It tells them they are lonely, beleaguered members of their community who have, and deserve, political respect. It sets them at the centre of our future - better than lawyers, doctors, cops: the new TV superheroes. Bush shrewdly made such faith seem tangible in Philadelphia as he let two young public headmasters (one from Texas, one from the Bronx) talk onstage about their own special schools - which teach inner city kids 10 hours a day (plus two hours' homework) and demand an intensity of commitment from staff and pupils alike. Stunning effort; stunning results; mesmeric professionals in action. </p> <p>America, typically, thinks that to be good, teachers have to feel good first - that morale can be bestowed and self-esteem constructed. Crude marketing in a phoney \"war\"? Perhaps. But watch, the force of expectation is with it. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Harry Oppenheimer, the billionaire South African mining magnate who oversaw a gold and diamond empire stretching from Johannesburg to the City of London, has died aged 91. <p>The man they called \"Multinational Harry\", whose family firms dominated the South African economy and the world gold and diamond markets for most of the last century, died at a Johannesburg hospital on Saturday night. </p> <p>He had been admitted on Friday night, complaining of stomach pains and a severe headache. The cause of death is unknown. </p> <p>Oppenheimer took over the helm of family businesses - the gold mining conglomerate, Anglo-American and the diamond marketing cartel, De Beers in 1957, at the age of 49. When Anglo American, founded by his father Sir Ernest Oppenheimer in 1917, grew too large and powerful for the limited confines of South Africa, Oppenheimer nurtured it into the world's largest mining company. </p> <p>He was widely credited with the stroke of marketing genius behind the De Beers campaign promoting diamonds as the ultimate gift of love. The advertising blitz culminated in De Beers' famous \"A Diamond is Forever\" campaign. </p> <p>Oppenheimer built a reputation as an audacious corporate operator who used his network of rich and influential contacts to avoid the economic isolation apartheid brought upon his native country. Julian Ogilvie Thompson, Anglo American chairman, described him yesterday as \"one of South Africa's greatest sons\". </p> <p>Tributes flooded in from all sides of the South African political spectrum for Oppenheimer who served as an MP for the opposition United party in South Africa's parliament from 1948 to 1957, as the ruling Nationalist party laid the foundations of the apartheid system. </p> <p>A pragmatist, Oppenheimer was a long-time advocate of reforming the apartheid system, but he was no radical, envisaging at best a limited franchise for the black majority. </p> <p>\"We wish to acknowledge the contribution Mr Oppenheimer made in building the economy of our country, as well as the role he and his company played in creating employment for hundreds of thousands of South Africans as well as citizens of our neighbouring countries,\" ANC spokesman Nat Serache said in a statement. </p> <p>\"Harry Oppenheimer was a man of great intellect, huge personal charm and extraordinary generous philanthropy,\" said Tony Leon, leader of the opposition Democratic party. \"He was also first and foremost a non-racial liberal.\" </p> <p>But the economic success of his firms was also considered crucial to the survival of the apartheid government, which ruled until South Africa's first all-race elections in 1994. </p> <p>His labour-intensive mines thrived on the migrant labour system that forced black workers to live apart from their families in worker hostels. His companies paid black workers far less than its white employees. </p> <p>Oppenheimer's retirement at the end of 1984 as the head of the De Beers mining group, just two years after relinquishing the same office at Anglo American, marked the end of his active control in the family businesses. He lived to see the listing of Anglo American in London and its immediate ranking in the top 25 of the FTSE 100 index in June 1999, with a market capitalisation of $12 bn - a far cry from the \u00a31m his father had used to set up the company 82 years before. </p> <p>Few observers doubt that the chairmanship of Anglo and De Beers will eventually pass to Harry's only son Nicholas (Nicky) Oppenheimer, currently head of De Beers' London-based diamond marketing arm, Central Selling Organisation.</p>",
  "Harry Oppenheimer, who has died aged 91, was South Africa's foremost industrialist for nearly 40 years, and the last of the latter-day \"Randlords\". <p>Although by the mid-1980s he had relinquished formal control of the two great strands in his business empire, the Anglo American Corporation and De Beers Consolidated Mines, he continued to exercise a daily influence as the grand old man of South African mining, and remained a De Beers director until 1994. </p> <p>Long feted in the west as a singular beacon of reform, his vast interests in gold, platinum, diamonds and coal nevertheless stoked the economic engine that maintained the ability of the regime to survive and prosper for the white minority. As he himself remarked in 1984, when beginning to disengage from the business: \"In a South African context I may seem to be a liberal, but at heart I'm just an old-fashioned conservative.\" </p> <p>But as a canny and ruthless operator, Oppenheimer was also one of the first South African businessmen to realise in the early 1980s that dialogue with the African National Congress was not only prudent but inevitable. His prescience paid off, for it was those early contacts that contributed to the ANC's long march away from any thought of nationalising the country's mining industry. </p> <p>On a personal level, Oppenheimer was a self-effacing, very private family man with a record of philanthropy that seemed out of place in the hard world of international mining and finance. Despite the miserable conditions and poor wages of the tens of thousands of migrant labourers who worked the mines, he portrayed himself as a gentleman Anglophile, and had an ability to beguile his critics with either dignified silence or pained politeness. This character, together with his enormous financial clout, enabled him to navigate the treacherous waters of apartheid South Africa. </p> <p>Oppenheimer was born in the De Beers company town of Kimberley, the site of the famous diamond \"big hole\", six years after the death of the De Beers founder and empire-builder Cecil Rhodes. He came from a family of prosperous German Jews who emigrated to London and South Africa in the 1890s to work in the diamond business. His father, Ernest, a naturalised Briton, Anglican convert, and future mayor of Kimberley, was in the process of capturing control of the De Beers diamond production and sales through the London syndicate which produced the world's most enduring, secretive and sophisticated cartel. </p> <p>Like many offspring of wealthy \"English\", as opposed to Boer, families, Oppenheimer was sent to public school in England. After Charterhouse, he moved on to Christ Church, Oxford, and then joined the boards of both De Beers and the Anglo American Corporation, which Ernest had set up in 1917 to control the group's gold, coal and industrial interests. </p> <p>At the outbreak of the second world war, Oppenheimer joined the 4th South African armoured car regiment as a brigade intelligence officer, working with the British Army in North Africa. In 1940, having transferred to Coastal Command, he met Signals Lieutenant Bridget McCall, on a posting to Robben Island. They married in 1943, and the following year Oppenheimer resigned his commission and became managing director of Anglo-American. </p> <p>Like his father, whose career and personality he mirrored in so many ways, Oppenheimer also launched himself into politics. In the 1948 elections that propelled the Nationalists into power, he stood for General Smuts' United Party in Kimberley, becoming the second \"Member for De Beers\" and the leading opposition spokesman on economic affairs. In that same year the Oppenheimers' New York advertising agency coined the immortal slogan: \"A diamond is forever.\" </p> <p>In public, Oppenheimer's wealth and power attracted the odium of the Afrikaner Nationalists - just as his father had to suffer the anti-Semitic nickname Hoggenheimer, portrayed as the silk-hatted and bloated Jewish capitalist. But far from being disloyal, Oppenheimer began co-operating with the government on its uranium development programme for the US and Britain. </p> <p>On his father's death in 1957, Oppenheimer left parliament to assume control of the family businesses. In 1959 he joined the new Progressive Party, which he financed personally. His politics during these years were cautiously reformist. He did not think that apartheid was morally wrong, and believed that separation of the races was necessary to maintain white civilisation. But he did recognise pragmatically that blacks had legitimate demands to participate in the economic growth of the country - and his companies - and he consistently urged more flexible labour laws. It was no coincidence that Harold Macmillan dined with the Oppenheimers on the eve of his \"wind of change\" speech. </p> <p>In response to the black unrest of the late 1950s and early 1960s, Oppenheimer sought to reassure the international community that South Africa was still a good investment risk. He helped set up the South Africa Foundation after the Sharpeville massacre of 1961, and then, after the 1976 Soweto uprising, the Urban Foundation, which poured millions of rands into welfare and housing schemes for blacks. </p> <p>But throughout his stewardships of South Africa's largest conglomerate - worth more than 50% of the Johannesburg stock exchange - conditions in the mines for migrant black workers were overcrowded and brutal; wages hovered around the poverty line and racism among the white managers was the norm. But for all that he was still prepared to meet and treat with the miners' militant leaders, even engaging in civilised public debate with the NUM's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, over white wine and canapes at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg in 1986. </p> <p>In his private life Oppenheimer could retreat to his beautiful Dutch colonial-style mansion of Brenthurst on the outskirts of Johannesburg, where in 1984 he opened an opulent private library of Africana. His own study, with its collection of Romantic poets and first editions, overlooked a gentle lily pond. </p> <p>Oppenheimer is survived by his wife, a daughter, Mary, and a son, Nicholas. </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Harry Frederick Oppenheimer, industrialist, born October 28 1908; died August 19 2000</p>",
  "<p>Have secretarial skills, will travel. Demand for British secretaries abroad - and for foreign secretaries in this country - has never been greater and incentives are increasing by the month. So if you're suffering from that annual August urge not only to holiday abroad, but to stay there, you could be in luck. </p> <p>\"Not only is computer technology making secretarial work similar the world over, but businesses themselves are becoming increasingly global,\" says Lisa Hilton, a business manager at global recruitment agency Manpower, which has 3,200 offices in 50 countries. \"They want staff to reflect that.\" </p> <p>Manda Ritchie, an international recruitment consultant, believes there are additional reasons. \"British companies are expanding overseas at a higher rate than ever. That means there is increasing opportunity for British secretaries to work away without learning another language,\" she says. \"Foreign secretaries have more opportunities to come here because of the opening up of Europe: approximately 40,000 arrived last year on a working visa. Finally, cheap air fares - even to destinations like Oz - are encouraging people from practically every western country to pack their bags.\" </p> <p>And why go for the usual nomadic jobs, such as nannying and bar work, when you can make a packet, as well as improve your office skills, by turning your hand to administration? </p> <p>\"Five people from my circle of university-leaving friends did it,\" says graduate Sarah Miggs, 22, who worked as a temp in Brussels for a year. \"It's a great way to discover a bit of the world, while at the same time getting experience in areas like IT and communication, which proves invaluable in practically every future job.\" </p> <p>Like most secretaries with a touch of wanderlust, Miggs applied for work once she had arrived at her destination. But if your travelling dreams require more safety nets, fear not. It is increasingly possible to arrange short or long-term placements before you've even posed for your passport snapshot. </p> <p>For high-flyers, recruitment consultancy Angela Mortimer is currently sponsoring the Mountbatten Scheme. \"This offers graduates the opportunity to complete up to 12 months' work experience and study in New York as a PA,\" explains Annabel Lindsay, head of the graduate and college leaver division. \"If successful, the graduate comes away with a certificate in international business practice. In a world where employers are looking for candidates who can bring more to a company than just a good degree and two weeks' office experience, it is extremely worthwhile.\" She admits, however, that securing one of the 150 annual places is increasingly tough. </p> <p>Sarah Kennedy, 22, who found out about the scheme after her friend returned from an interview at Angela Mortimer clutching a leaflet, agrees. \"My stint was as a PA to three lawyers in a large law firm on Seventh Avenue and I walked into a job as marketing administrator at KPMG in London upon my return. They recognised that a secretarial role in New York is demanding, incredibly fast-paced, and often quite scary. If I could cope with that, they probably realised I was worth investing in.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, international agency Drake offers a less graduate-driven option, giving all temps the chance not only to work in a range of countries, but to build up their \"Drake passport\", consisting of typing skills, IT experience and references. \"For people working abroad, it can be difficult to have an easily verifiable track record. This aims to change that,\" says Lee-Anne Van Heer Den, temporary consultant at Drake UK. </p> <p>Increasingly, British recruitment agencies are teaming up with other consultancies around the world to set up exchange programmes. \"The consultancy we deal with happens to be in Sydney,\" says Amanda Fone, director of Angela Mortimer. Any British secretary on their books simply needs to enquire whether there is anything available \"down under\": \"If you tell us you're off to Australia at the weekend, there's every chance we could have a placement ready for you the following week,\" she says. </p> <p>Similarly, administration staff with the travel bug can take advantage of the larger recruitment consultancies setting up offices abroad. \"We have 3,000 offices across 52 countries,\" says Angela Lewis, resource manager at Adecco. \"All applicants have to do is approach any Adecco office for our worldwide guide and then telephone the head office in the country they're interested in to arrange to have an application form mailed to them.\" </p> <p>But make sure you know the facts before you pack your bags. Among the questions you should be asking is whether it is legal for British people to work in your chosen country. If yes, what documentation will you need and what financial arrangements must you make? Should your CV be in a different format? What is the employment rate like and will you be guaranteed work for a particular length of time? Manda Ritchie suggests finding out as much as possible from the embassy or consulate. \"They can give you information on work permits, accommodation and employment,\" she explains. </p> <p>Australia is the current hot spot for travelling secretaries, with Melbourne a firm favourite. Provided you have a work visa, it is legal to work there for three months at a stretch. In other countries, however, doing anything other than voluntary work could be overstaying your welcome. </p> <p>Philippe Milloux, deputy head of the French Institute in London, claims it's worth enquiring how much you can expect to be paid after tax. In Ireland, for instance, income tax can hit you like a slap in the face. And in France you could get paid half what you would expect here. \"Mind you, in Paris you can rent a flat for a month for what you might pay for a week in London,\" stresses Milloux. </p> <p>You'll also want to consider quali fications. Julie Holmes, business development manager for the Netherlands at recruitment agency Crone Corkill, points out that PA roles in Holland are less secretarial and more assistant-based. \"It's not unusual for a PA to the head of marketing to have a degree in marketing and to be given their own projects,\" she points out. </p> <p>A major concern for travelling secretaries is what kind of language skills will be expected. This entirely depends on the consultancy and country in question, the size of the company, the nature of your position, and the sector. Finance and banking, fashion and cosmetics, and management consultancy, for example, are more likely to require some knowledge of the local language. But even if you find work in a foreign-speaking country that doesn't require you to know the language, it is worth attempting to learn the basics. Not only is it polite but it will improve your social life. </p> <p>A little prior knowledge can also help to overcome tricky cultural differences, says Angelena Boden, author of The Cultural Gaffes Pocketbook (Management Pocketbooks, \u00a36.99). First names, for instance, are still not used in certain areas of the continent. And even apparently international gestures such as nodding or shaking your head can lead to confusion: in Bulgaria and parts of Greece, Turkey and Iran, for instance, \"yes\" is signalled by a lateral head sway, which can easily be confused with a shake of the head. </p> <p>\"Germans have a much more direct attitude than the English, and you've got to be able to handle that and not be offended,\" adds Cathy Fawcett, a senior consultant at Language Recruitment Services. \"Meanwhile, Spanish and Italians are flamboyant. The stiff upper-lipped English secretary who winds up there could find him or herself booking a return flight within a week.\" </p> <p> <strong>Case studies: a Melburnian in London and a Londoner in Melbourne</strong></p> <p><strong> Natalie Doherty</strong> , 27, from Melbourne, is currently working as an office manager for KiCap Management in London </p> <p>'Having spent a couple of months touring Africa en route, I arrived in London and signed up with Joslin Rowe. They got me secretarial work pretty much immediately. Most of the assignments were fairly brief, because that's what I'd asked for. I figured it would be the best way to meet people and to get time off in between to discover England. I was right. I made a lot of lasting friends and had loads of fun. </p> <p>\"It also enabled me to learn a great deal about different computer systems, which I wanted to show off on my CV, and gave me huge confidence. Now, if I go into a job and they say, 'We assume you're familiar with system x ,' my reply is, 'No, but I can assure you I'll know it back to front within a couple of days.' </p> <p>\"People often think that secretarial work is boring, but I've met clients, organised conferences in Paris and Dublin, and been given lots of responsibility. It helps that I've had great jobs. </p> <p>\"Eventually, I settled down in a more permanent assignment at a company called Fidelity Investments - they've offered me a job in their Sydney offices when I get back in October.\" </p> <p><strong> Elizabeth Holmes </strong> , 28, from London, recently worked as a secretary in Melbourne. She now works as a senior contracts sales consultant for ASR in London </p> <p>First stop, Sydney. I had no money, no friends, no accommodation. </p> <p>\"But Adecco saved the day by getting me secretarial temporary work straight away. [At work] I met two girls who I moved into a flat with in Bondi Beach. Life was a ball, which was helped no end by my fantastic salary. My employer even put me on the payroll so that he could keep me on for a while. </p> <p>\"After a few months, when I'd saved enough money, I travelled all over Australia and wound up in Melbourne. Once again, I had no dosh and nowhere to live. </p> <p>\"I stuffed envelopes for two days and then I got a brilliant secretarial post with the Melbourne Institute of Technology. They, too, gave me a contract and kept me on for the whole of the rest of my stay - which was six months. </p> <p>\"I learned so many skills that I came back to England and got a senior role. In fact, the Institute said they would sponsor me to stay in Oz if I wanted.

  "<p>'There's two great things about being involved with a small company,\" says Sophie Smith, who has worked part-time at the Catto Gallery in Hampstead for the past two-and-a-half years. \"One is that you get to do a bit of everything: no two days are the same. The other is that you can practically invent your own job title - mine is marketing manager, which sounds very grand, but in a family-run business like this, it does describe a lot of what I do.\" </p> <p>Smith's day starts with the large amount of post that comes into the gallery each morning. \"We often get artists sending in photographs and slides to see if we would be interested in exhibiting their work. I learned very early on how to differentiate between the possibles and the not-possibles: it might be that someone is too abstract, their style isn't right for us, or they may simply not be of a high enough standard. I always send their work back with a customised letter, explaining why we feel they're not right for us. The 'possibles' I pass on to the gallery manager.\" </p> <p>Smith's job covers all aspects of the gallery - administration, dealing with clients, and researching and writing about the artists who exhibit. \"Sometimes I can spend nearly all my day on the phone,\" she says. \"We have a new artist exhibiting every two to four weeks and before the show takes place we send out a catalogue to clients on our database. As soon as a catalogue goes out the phone starts ringing, with people wanting to reserve pictures, or to know costs - some even buy paintings over the phone. Other times, an artist will ring, wanting to know if we've sold any paintings, or with a question about an upcoming exhibition.\" </p> <p>Interviewing and writing is something Smith particularly enjoys. \"The catalogue obviously has images of the pictures in the exhibition, but it also contains some background about the artist, which I write,\" she explains. \"I try to find out what their influences are, where they learned to paint, what the subject matter is, and include a couple of good quotes. I also talk to people when they come into the gallery, so it's important to know the background of the artist.\" </p> <p>Then, of course, there are the more typical organisational responsibilities. \"Compared to a conventional office, the administration is quite minimal,\" says Smith. \"There are systems in place which make everything very easy - our printing company doesn't just produce the catalogue, but also manages the envelope stuffing and sending. We have openings almost once a month, and a regular chef comes in to do the catering, so that needs very little organising.\" </p> <p>Smith is also involved with an offshoot of the gallery, Corporate Catto, which is a consultancy service for large businesses that want to display art in their offices. \"I phone round companies, explain what we do and find out who we should send a press pack to. It's interesting because the artists on the Corporate Catto books are far more contemporary than the ones we tend to have at the gallery,\" she explains. </p> <p>\"The nice thing is that you never know how a day is going to go,\" she adds. \"Some days it will be really quiet, other days people are constantly walking in, phones are going and it's really buzzy. But either way is fine: I work with really nice people and spend my days surrounded by beautiful paintings, so I can't complain.\"</p>",

  "After leading East Timor's guerrillas for most of the 25-year struggle that culminated last year in freedom from Indonesia, Jose Alexandre \"Xanana\" Gusmao yesterday retired as their commander to concentrate on guiding the nation towards full independence. <p>Speaking at a ceremony in the town of Aileu, 25 miles south of Dili, Mr Gusmao made a thinly-veiled attack on the UN for the fact that his Falantil forces are not being allowed to do more to combat incursions by Indonesian paramilitaries into East Timor in recent weeks. The clashes left two peacekeepers dead and several injured. </p> <p>In an indication that Mr Gusmao, 53, is moving towards becoming East Timor's first elected president in polls expected next year, he said his retirement was \"part of the process of preparing East Timor for independence\". </p> <p>\"I believe I can play some role in the political process and I must do that as a civilian,\" said Mr Gusmao, who handed over command to his deputy, Taur Matan Ruak. </p> <p>A former poet and seminarian, Mr Gusmao joined Falantil shortly after Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975. Quickly rising to become its commander, he harried the tens of thousands of Indonesian forces occupying the territory until 1991 when he was betrayed and captured. </p> <p>He remained an icon while in prison until after the East Timorese overwhelmingly voted for independence in a UN-sponsored vote last August. </p> <p>He ceded control on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the rebel group, which faces an uncertain future. Most of its 1,000 fighters are restricted to the Aileu district. A handful liaise with the UN peacekeepers while the others watch as Indonesian militiamen again roam with impunity. </p> <p>Diplomatic sources in Jakarta say there is firm evidence that the militia are being supported by elements within the Indonesian army and that their ranks include former special forces troops - possibly even current members. </p> <p>The UN administrator in East Timor, Sergio Vieira de Mello, admitted that the territory faces a possible guerrilla threat for months to come if not longer, but he has refused to order his PKF peacekeepers to go after the militias, despite having the mandate to do so. </p> <p>\"We have not come to East Timor to kill people,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Vieira de Mello has also refused to allow Falantil to play an active role in the counter-insurgency operation. </p> <p>Mr Gusmao said he has pleaded for Falantil to participate. \"We're ready to help the PKF [peacekeepers] and we know that they have got several difficulties so we have already offered to help as much as possible,\" he said. \"But the decision depends on the UN.\" </p> <p>Thousands of East Timorese living along the border are in constant fear of attack, even though civilians have yet to be targeted. \"None of us can sleep at night. We experienced what the militia did last year and are terrified they are going to do it again,\" said Roberto da Costa, who lives in Maliana, three miles from the border.</p>",
  "Supporters of two jailed charity workers - who were convicted of allowing drug dealing at a day centre for the homeless which they helped to run - are calling for a change in the law. <p>The Cambridge Two Campaign described section 8 of the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, under which Ruth Wyner and her colleague John Brock were convicted, as a dangerous law which should be rewritten. </p> <p>Wyner, 50, director of the Wintercomfort centre in Cambridge, was jailed for five years last year. Brock, 50, a manager at the centre, was given a four-year sentence. </p> <p>Last month the court of appeal in London released them both pending appeals against their convictions. </p> <p>The pair were convicted after King's Lynn crown court heard how police filmed eight people dealing in drugs at the day centre during an undercover operation. </p> <p>There was no suggestion that Wyner or Brock were involved in drug dealing and their lawyers said there was no evidence that they had seen deals take place and ignored them. </p> <p>Alexander Masters, chairman of the Cambridge Two Campaign, said: \"Ruth Wyner and John Brock thought they had a good relationship with the police at the time. The beat officer dropped in regularly for cups of tea. A police officer sat on the centre's advisory committee. </p> <p>\"Until Section 8 is rewritten it will be impossible for charities working with the homeless or with drug users ever to feel safe.\" </p> <p>Mr Masters said the campaign was launching a petition calling for the law to be rewritten, and already had the backing of the MPs Anne Campbell and Peter Bottomley, the union Unison and Release, the national drugs and legal advice helpline.</p>",
  "It sounds like a George Orwell story: Britain is to use computers to help fix the sentences of criminals and their release dates. <p>Sir Graham Smith, chief inspector of probation, told reporters last week that this would be \"a world first\". His motives were sound enough: a wish to improve the consistency of sentencing. His service produces 600,000 reports for the courts every year but \"we have relied too much on nous, instinct and feel. In the past nous has been important, but people have used it in different ways.\" </p> <p>Now, as well as the reports, the courts would receive a risk prediction from a computer, based on a large category of factors: criminal record; education, training, employability; lifestyle and associates; alcohol and drug use; emotional stability; relationships; attitudes to crime; general social behaviour; and postcode. </p> <p>This is not such a new invention as Sir Graham implied. A young Home Office researcher, Chris Nuttall, who later be came head of research, devised a similar but non-computerised guide for the parole board 25 years ago, but it fell into disuse. There has been at least one previous computer model. </p> <p>Sir Graham needs to be more honest about the new system's limitations. It will not be able to predict what an individual will do, only place the individual into a risk category. Even a high-risk category - say with a 70% risk of reconviction - would still mean 30% would not be reconvicted. First, how are the civil rights of these \"false positives\" going to be protected? Second, he needs to release the research showing how good a predictor each of the factors is. Why are postcodes being included? They should be left to postmen, not used for sentencing. Third, he must answer the Law Society's objections: this is a serious shift in sentencing - from what an offender has done to what he or she might do. Computers can be an aid, but never a substitute for human discretion in delivering justice.</p>",
  "Without fanfare Britain and the United States have resumed their bombing of Iraq. Whether or not the official Iraqi reports that the latest attacks killed civilians are true, the bombing is unnecessary and reckless. <p>After long debate the United Nations passed a resolution many months ago setting up a new inspection system designed mainly to check Iraqi progress in dismantling its weapons of mass destruction and the potential to re-create them. The inspectors have recruited their team and will soon be ready to visit Baghdad. Although Iraq has not yet said it will accept them, for some weeks it has not repeated its statements rejecting the resolution that set up the inspection team. There is therefore an opportunity that could make it easier for the team to start work. </p> <p>Air attacks on Iraq at this moment cannot help the climate. To claim, as the United States and Britain do, that they contain no political message and are merely a technically triggered reaction to the fact that Iraqi defences have locked on to the planes is disingenuous. The aircraft that patrol the two no-fly zones over Iraq are under political control and Washington and London could easily reduce the number of flights. </p> <p>Britain and the United States should also take more seriously the questions which the Iraqis have raised about the new inspectors. When the council authorised the team, the aim was to find a quicker way of achieving compliance and ending the international sanctions, which have dragged on for almost 10 years. It is true that the sanctions have been eased but they are still in force and doing serious harm to ordinary people, though very little to the regime. Iraq wants to know whether there is a finite term in sight if it cooperates with the inspectors or whether it is entering another tunnel in which objections will constantly be raised. </p> <p>The American presidential election complicates the matter since neither candidate wants to appear weak. But the Iraqi bogy has fortunately lost much of its resonance in American politics and there is no reason why sensitive diplomacy at the United Nations should suddenly explode into a campaign issue. Rather than sending warplanes over Iraq the United States and Britain should be sending signals to their UN missions to urge the secretary-general to answer Iraq's legitimate questions.</p>",
  "Patient trials show that the fat-fighting properties of a popular supplement for slimmers do work. Studies in the United States and Norway revealed that conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) helped the overweight shed fat, and improved the control of adult-onset diabetes. <p>CLA is a fatty acid occurring in many dairy products and beef. Studies on animals suggest it also enhances immune function, and combats several types of cancer and narrowing of the arteries. </p> <p>Results of the first human trials of the supplement were presented at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Washington. </p> <p>Eighty overweight people, in a study at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, dieted and exercised. Most initially lost weight and then regained it on stopping their diets. But those taking CLA regained less fat and retained more muscle. Results from Norway suggested CLA might aid weight loss even without dieting. </p> <p>At Purdue University, Indiana, an eight-week diabetes study with 22 volunteers showed that, of those taking CLA, 64% showed an improvement in insulin levels. Martha Belury, a chief researcher, said coupling CLA with pharmaceuticals could cut the health care costs of type-two diabetes and the side effects of long-term drug use.</p>",
  "Ornithologists says Britain's songbird population is being threatened by an explosion in the numbers of magpies. <p>The bird, which has adapted to suburban areas and whose numbers are reported to have doubled in 12 months, will \"kill an entire brood of blackbirds\", according to Ian Henderson, of the British Trust for Ornithology. </p> <p>The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said the mild wet winter, a good spring, and changes in farming, had led to an excellent breeding year for magpies. \"Some aspects of agricultural intensification are to their benefit,\" said Julian Hughes, the trust's head of species. \"A short sward means ground insects, and also beetles being more easily available.\" </p> <p>Mr Hughes said magpies could switch easily from one food source to another. \"They do well out of carrion and the increased road mortality among small animals.\" Sheep farmers in Wiltshire have report that magpies are \"attacking weakened lambs\". </p> <p>Traditionally gamekeepers killed magpies by shooting and trapping, but farmers claim the crisis in the rural economy has led to a decline in keepers' activities. </p> <p>Stuart Burton, who owns the Bracken Bank estate near Penrith, said trapping now did not work: \"The traps are interfered with by people on the footpaths and the magpies released.\"</p>",
  "Former MI5 officer David Shayler will return from France today to face charges under section 1 of the Official Secrets Act. With Liberty's help, he will eventually put his case before a jury. <p>There is an important tradition of whistle-blowing in this country: Clive Ponting on the sinking of the Argentine ship, the General Belgrano, during the Falklands war; Sarah Tisdall on the arrival of cruise missiles at Greenham Common; and Cathy Massiter on MI5 spying on Liberty, CND and others. It was as a result of a complaint by Liberty to the European Commission on Human Rights, using Massiter's evidence, that the government brought forward the Security Services Act 1989. This imposed the first elements of legal control over the service. </p> <p>In the absence of an adequate system of accountability for the security services, we are reliant on whistle-blowers such as David Shayler to expose malpractice. The controls in the 1989 act and those in the subsequent legislation remain inadequate. The parliamentary committee set up to oversee all the secret services is prevented from considering \"operational\" matters. In fact, in its report and in the first ever debate about the secret services, no mention was made of any recent allegations and no member of parliament asked a single question about them. This was despite the fact that many of the allegations made about the services are very serious and include the suggestion that MI6 helped to fund a plot to kill the leader of another country. </p> <p>The complaints mechanism, which was also set up by the legislation, works in secret. It does not allow a complainant to see any documents, evidence or details of suspicions. It can, in effect, only rule against the service if its decision to bug and tap was \"perverse\". The complaints tribunal cannot give reasons for its decisions and, since its creation, has never upheld one single complaint. </p> <p>For any human rights organisation, monitoring the workings of the most secret part of the state must remain a priority. The state does have a duty to use covert techniques to protect us from those who are intending to use violence. However, there is no logical reason why those techniques require a special organisation. </p> <p>Questions must now be raised about whether the service continues to provide an essential function or whether the existence of an internal secret police force can be justified in a society not at war. Any internal secret police service is inevitably corrosive of privacy, openness and democratic accountability. When the service is involved in the criminal justice system the right to a fair trial suffers unnecessarily because of the culture of secrecy and the need to protect the identity of individuals and the nature of operations. The culture of secrecy also results in restricted access by the defence to documents, secret public interest immunity hearings and anonymous witnesses cross-examined behind screens. </p> <p>The question is whether those resources and that expertise should exist outside the police service. The negative effect on openness and accountability of having those expert resources within the service, rather than within the police, is substantial. Our problem as outsiders is whether we should trust those on the inside when they tell us not to worry. </p> <p>Although there is now some protection for whistleblowers, MI5 officers are exempt. Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act provides no defence where a disclosure was made in the public interest or caused no damage to national security. This provides the second reason for Liberty's involvement in the Shayler case. We want to take advantage of the fact that the Human Rights Act is likely to change the way the Official Secrets Act is interpreted. The Human Rights Act imposes a duty on the courts to interpret other laws so that they comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. The key right here is article 10, freedom of expression. Interestingly Tony Blair, Jack Straw and many other cabinet members voted in parliament against the act precisely because of the absence of a public interest defence in the legislation itself. </p> <p>Once we establish this defence it will be up to David to convince the jury that he made the right decisions and the disclosure of malpractice was in the public interest. </p> <p>It is not clear exactly how the courts will try to bring the Official Secrets Act into compliance with the convention, but it is clear that the act will need to be interpreted in a different way, a way that gives more respect to freedom of expression and the public interest in disclosure. David Shayler's case will ensure that this has to happen urgently. </p> <p> John Wadham is director of Liberty and David Shayler's solicitor </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Iran's moves towards democratic rule, which began three years ago with the landslide victory of President Mohammad Khatami, appear little more than a fleeting moment in history now that conservatives have reasserted their control. <p>Hardliners in the judiciary have closed almost two dozen newspapers and journals. Nearly all the country's prominent reformist journalists have been imprisoned, prompting the Paris-based Reporters sans Fronti\u00e8res to declare last week that Iran is the \"world's largest prison for journalists\". </p> <p>And reformist leaders have been muzzled out of fear that conservative clerics on the powerful Guardian Council could try to expel MPs from their seats for being insufficiently \"Islamic\". The reformers are also deprived of their main political weapon - public protest - because any major confrontation with security forces in the hands of conservatives would be likely to end in a bloodbath. </p> <p>Six months ago, when reformers rose to victory on President Khatami's coattails, capturing a majority of seats in the first round of parliamentary polls, there was great hope that political pluralism could overcome 2,500 years of centralised rule. But today the picture looks very different. </p> <p>The reformist majority in parliament proved to be ineffectual earlier this month, when the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, used his power to kill a proposed bill which would have gone a long way towards reviving the banned press. A press court acted immediately, closing the last major progressive newspaper, Bahar, and jailing more journalists. </p> <p>But even before Ayatollah Khamenei's unprecedented action, leading reformers were already acknowledging that their majority in parliament had vast limitations. \"Being a majority does not necessarily bring power. If we wish to reform everything overnight, then undoubtedly our wishes will not come true,\" Mohammad Reza Khatami, deputy speaker of parliament and brother of the president, told the Guardian on July 21. </p> <p>Holding the presidency, too, has failed to produce the degree of power the reformers had expected. With a mandate of 20m votes, or 70% of the electorate, President Khatami assumed he could implement vast change. But as the leader of the opposition movement who managed to enter the power structure, he has been required to make such compromises with the conservative establishment that he has been reduced to a symbol of Iran's potential. As an intellectual cleric and humanitarian, Mr Khatami holds out the promise that Iran could form an Islamic-style democracy, but that dream is far from being realised. </p> <p>With no control over the armed forces, which in Iran include the police, and little influence within the judiciary, driven primarily by political rather than legal considerations, Mr Khatami has been silenced as conservatives in these institutions trample his loyalists. </p> <p>In times of political crisis, Mr Khatami generally stays out of public view. However, in a speech on Wednesday before the leading student group which helped bring him to power, the president vowed to remain true to the reforms he promised three years go. But he said change must come slowly - an apparent signal that he wanted to avoid confrontation. </p> <p>\"I stand firm on my promises. We ought to have a free climate for expression of views and not betray people's dreams. But I believe there is no other way to reach our goals than through a calm and gradual process,\" said Mr Khatami. </p> <p><b> Khatami criticised</b><br> Some reformers criticise the president and other like-minded loyalists for their refusal to confront the conservatives. \"I sat in a room with the leading reformers when the conservatives arrested the first journalist, and I said we must organise protests, we must stop this with force,\" said one leading activist who wished to remain anonymous. </p> <p>\"But the reformers said: 'We can't make trouble now that we are part of the game. We have to cooperate.' And the more they compromised, the more they watched their friends get arrested. Now, all the people who were sitting in that room with me are in jail.\" </p> <p>The conservatives, at first caught off guard by the Khatami onslaught, changed their strategy several months ago and began using all their institutional might to quash the reformers. In the early days of the Khatami presidency, it was primarily Islamic vigilantes who broke up peaceful rallies and beat intellectuals at university lectures. </p> <p>But in recent months, the militant fringe has taken a backseat to powerful conservatives who hold legitimate positions in government. Now, it is hardliners in the judiciary who are eliminating people they call their \"enemies\", rather than shadowy religious extremists with high-level backing. </p> <p>Ayatollah Khamenei, the symbol of the conservative establishment, has decided to move to the forefront, issuing directives that conservatives within the judiciary or law enforcement then follow. The first wave of newspaper closures, for example, came two days after Ayatollah Khamenei declared in April that the reformist papers were \"bases of the enemy\". </p> <p>As his health worsens -he is believed to have prostate cancer - Ayatollah Khamenei appears more determined to secure the conservatives' hold on power before his death. But the price he is paying for the crackdown is immense; he has ceased being a sacred, untouchable public figure. By throwing himself directly into the political fray, he is now the subject of criticism in the way any political figure might be. </p> <p>University students chant slogans against him at rallies. And even more unprecedented, some theologians in the holy Shi'ite city of Qom have dared to distribute leaflets criticising him on theological and political grounds. </p> <p>The main issue driving the conservatives' onslaught is their belief that divine rule has power over the republic. \"Islam was the government of God, not the government of the people,\" said Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi, a leading ideologue of the right. They are also reacting to the growing belief in society that clerics should remain outside politics, as they had for centuries. </p> <p>The February parliamentary polls saw fewer clerics elected to office since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, causing alarm in the conservative camp, which subscribes to the belief articulated by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini: \"Those intellectuals who say that the clergy should leave politics and go back to the mosque speak on behalf of Satan.\" </p> <p>In allowing Mohammad Khatami to run for office, the establishment hoped a moderate mullah could save the declining reputation of the clergy. Mr Khatami was selected to show Iran and the world that religious moderation was possible in an Islamic government. </p> <p>But three years on, Mr Khatami and the reformers are at a crossroads. Will the only achievement of their movement, billed as Islam's great Enlightenment, be the freedom women now enjoy to walk city streets wearing open-toed sandals and red lipstick?</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown is on honeymoon with Sarah and the voters. It's not just the understated, spin-free wedding that has impressed. Judging by Labour's post-spending review poll readings, they also adore him for pouring so much extra money - \u00a343bn - into key public services. Meanwhile, the economy, Labour's most valuable electoral asset, quietly goes from strength to strength. </p> <p>The Chancellor may be thousands of miles away, canoodling with his wife in Cape Cod, but he could not fail to have been cheered by last week's economic data and their favourable electoral implications. </p> <p>While unemployment fell to 1,070,000 in July, and at this rate will soon dip below the million mark, underlying inflation inflation held steady at 2.2% and wage growth eased from 4.6% to 4.1%, comfortably below the Bank of England's 4.5% speed limit. </p> <p>This at a time when the world economy is experiencing an oil price shock which, in the past, could have been sufficient to plunge it into recession. </p> <p>It's hard to imagine a better platform from which to launch a general election campaign. Whatever the cause of Britain's economic nirvana - skilful handling of macroeconomic policy or good luck or a combination of the two - Mr Brown and the government will take the credit on polling day. No wonder William \"14-pints\" Hague has been driven to drink. With everything going so well, it's natural that exponents of the dismal science should ask: where could it all go wrong? </p> <p>High on the list of disaster scenarios is the US economy going belly-up. It's been so often predicted that people automatically switch off when the subject is mentioned and the most recent data releases, showing accelerating productivity and subdued inflation, certainly give no comfort to the merchants of doom. But the risk of a hard landing caused by an asset price correction remains a very real threat to global and UK economic stability. The new economy may be able to grow much faster and for longer before running into the buffers, but the laws of supply and demand have not been repealed and it can only be a matter of time before the US economy overheats unless the pace of growth moderates soon. </p> <p>The pound also remains a wild card. Fears of meltdown in manufacturing may have receded as some firms learn to live with a strong currency, but anecdotal evidence suggests that there are many more hanging on for dear life. While they own plant in this country and believe that sterling's overvaluation is temporary, manufacturers are likely to carrying on producing their goods even at vastly reduced profit margins, but faced with a new investment decision they may move elsewhere if they can see no respite from the pain they are enduring. </p> <p>The Danish EMU referendum on September 28, if it is lost, could well undermine the euro and give another leg-up to sterling on the foreign exchanges, speeding the flow of job losses in Labour heartlands. While this will not derail the recovery, it could well have electoral implications. Although it will not prompt heartland voters to switch to the Tories, a sense of disillusionment with the government could prompt them to stay at home on polling day, giving the Conservatives seats by default. </p> <p>The down side risks to the economic outlook should not be overplayed. According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which has one of the best forecasting records, the chances of a full-blown recession next year are only 3%. The real threat to stability lies in the opposite direction. </p> <p>The Chancellor's public spending plans were formulated on the basis that, after peaking this year, economic growth will gradually slow under the combined weight of the strong pound and four quarter-point interest rate rises since last September. </p> <p>As consumer spending flagged, room would be created for public spending to take up the slack without putting upward pressure on inflation. However, with the autumn approaching, there is no hard evidence that domestic demand is slowing significantly. </p> <p>True, the housing market has come off the boil but it is still robust, and consumer confidence is being underpinned by rising real incomes and rapidly falling unemployment. Consumers are about to receive a fresh boost from a new wave of windfalls flowing from the demutualisation of the Bradford &amp; Bingley building society and various life assurance companies, including Scottish Widows, Friends Provident and Scottish Provident. </p> <p><strong> Spendthrift consumers</strong><br> With nominal interest rates still very low, it's not hard to imagine a scenario in which - far from retrenching - the consumer comes back from his holiday in a spendthrift mood. At the same time the economy's capacity to grow is being tested by buoyant IT-related business investment, albeit confined to the service sector. </p> <p>The optimistic interpretation of last week's figures, the one that is likely to prevail in the short term, is that there has been a dramatic improvement in the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. But the ex-bonus earnings data was less comforting, showing a decline to 4.4% from 4.6%. </p> <p>The pessimists - or should that be realists? - on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee may think the latest earnings data, still subject to uncertainty after the recent overhaul, represents the calm before the storm. While admitting it's possible we really are living in an era where inflation expectations have permanently adjusted downwards, conditioning workers to expect pay rises of between 3% and 4% from here to eternity, the inflation hawks no doubt continue to live in fear of a wage-price spiral. </p> <p>Geoff Dicks, of Royal Bank of Scotland, points out that this year's wage claims were based on headline rates of inflation of less than 2% at the end of 1999. Next year, they will be based on headline rates of between 3% and 4%. The National Institute says a slight pick-up in average earnings growth to about 6% in 2002 can be afforded because it will be paid for out of higher productivity. In this case, labour costs per unit of output will remain under control and not contribute to any significant increase of inflation. But the expected US-style pick-up in productivity growth is not guaranteed. </p> <p>The upshot is that while all seems well on the surface, the economy is actually at a very delicate point in the cycle where events could take a turn for the worse. In the late 1980s Nigel Lawson made the mistake of believing he had performed a miracle, cutting taxes and boosting domestic demand just when least needed. The result was a spectacular boom followed by bust. </p> <p>Mr Brown isn't foolish enough to believe his own publicity, but he has taken a gamble by being so generous on public spending. Although perfectly justifiable on social and economic grounds in the long term, in the short term his largesse could yet contribute to a further round of interest rate rises which would not endear him to homeowners. Borrowing costs won't climb as high as 15%, as they did to control the Lawson boom, but 7% or 8% is perfectly feasible. Voters would not see this as grounds for divorce, but it would spark a few rows between now and polling day. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mark.atkinson@theguardian.com\">mark.atkinson@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A faint whiff of sulphur hangs around the word favouritism. It implies pacts with the devil - selling your soul for promotion, or going for a pint with the boss every Friday, to ensure you get the desk next to the window when the office is re-organised.</p> <p>\"She only got it because she's the boss's favourite\" can also be a cute get-out. When someone else gets the job you want or the piece of work you've been coveting, it's a hell of a lot easier to blame the system than to admit the better man/woman won. </p> <p> The only thing worse than being on the suffering end of favouritism is to be wrongly accused yourself. At school, \"Teacher's pet\" meant isolation and resentment from the rest of the class . The only chance you had to get yourself back in the gang was by attempting to murder the teacher in question, possibly by tripwire on the stairs, but preferably by poison in the staff-room tea.</p> <p>Favouritism isn't just a boss-employee problem, either. Anyone with an atom of control or clout in the workplace can be accused. Even tea ladies used to be charged with having favourites before coffee machines became the norm, as there was always one colleague who got given two choccie digestives for smiling nicely and flattering horribly, instead of the regulation stale Rich Tea.</p> <p>Are you seething about jobs for the boys? Do all the promotions go to the ones who spend the rest of the year currying favour? Are you a victim of the Brown-nose brigade?</p> <p>Coping with favouritism is difficult because resentment is a hard emotion to tackle. Sounding and acting bitter can scupper your work image, but why bother to be positive when the favourites get all the rewards anyway? Often you feel faced with two stark choices: Suck up big-time, or quit your job.</p> <p>Before you do anything too radical, though, look at a few alternatives: <br>\u0095 No matter how much it pains you, you need to take very impartial view of the problem. Are you sure the charges of favouritism are valid? Or could they just be an excuse for your own lack of ability? If a colleague has been promoted over you it could be because they are better at the job. Put bitterness to one side and look at the facts. Are they more able? Is there any chance they got the job because they are more skilled? Harbouring resentment will do you no good if this is the case. Act grown-up and admit your failings so that you can improve before the next post is offered.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Why do you think this person is a particular favourite? Again, be objective. Do you know they are fancied by/friends with the boss? Are you basing this assumption on rumour or fact? </p> <p><br>\u0095 What have their rewards been? One woman was accused of being the boss's favourite because he always gave her the most work. Do you want to be the boss's extra-special slave? Think before you complain.</p> <p><br>\u0095 If you believe the charge to be valid and intend to take steps about it, sit down and plan your strategy beforehand. This is going to be a tricky negotiation.</p> <p>\u0095 Never use moaning to the rest of the team as part of your strategy. This is passive-aggressive behaviour. It gets you nowhere and only worsens the situation.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Decide whether to speak to the boss in question or someone else, like his/her line manager or someone in human resources. <br>\u0095 Try to avoid the use of the word favouritism in this dialogue. It sounds emotive and is hard to prove. Take specific proof of times when you feel you have been unfairly treated.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Be careful about using phrases like \"We all think...\" You may find the support you've been rallying from other colleagues evaporates quickly once an official complaint has been made.</p> <p><strong>And if you are accused?</strong></p> <p><br>\u0095 Keep cool. However unfair you think the accusations are you should avoid open conflict with the accusers. If you know you won that promotion through merit then you have nothing to worry about.</p> <p><br>\u0095Don't bad-mouth the boss just to try to get on good terms with your colleagues again. This could get back to him/her and ruin the good relationship you have.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Don't lose ground. One woman forged a good relationship with the new chief executive because he recognised her talent in a certain field. When a colleague warned her the others thought she was brown-nosing she started to avoid the new boss. She was then treated to the spectacle of her accusers sucking up to him big-time.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Look relaxed and calm. Don't let them see the accusations are getting to you.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Avoid confrontation in a bid to clear your name. I said that favouritism is a hard accusation to prove, but disproving it can be twice as difficult. Also - if your denial is done publicly - you may find you have alerted colleagues who weren't even aware of the idea in the first place. (A bit like denying you're having an affair with the entire local football team.)</p>",
  "<p><strong> Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries</strong>' senior executives will hold a crucial meeting today at which they are likely to reconsider a \u00a3470m takeover proposal from <strong> Botts &amp; Co</strong>, the private equity firm. </p> <p>Managing director David Thompson and his colleagues have come under pressure from shareholders to look again at the indicative offer, which they rejected on Friday. </p> <p>Wolves, which brews traditional beers such as Banks's, Cameron and Pedigree, has struggled to swallow two big recent acquisitions - Mansfield Brewery and Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed. </p> <p>The company's costs have spiralled out of control, partly due to a commitment to keep open all four of its breweries until at least 2001, despite the overcapacity in the industry. </p> <p>If Wolves reiterates its rejection of Botts' 500p a share proposal, the private equity firm is likely to issue a direct appeal to shareholders asking them to support an offer. Botts has indicated that it is prepared to put more money on the table if it finds Wolves' finances encouraging. The brewer has so far refused to open up its books. </p> <p>Botts has the backing of <strong> Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> and the US finance house <strong> Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette</strong> . </p>",
  "<p>If you could play a Test match on the Castle Ground pitch it almost certainly wouldn't be over in two, three or even four days. Two years ago, Essex spent all the last day unavailingly trying to bowl out Leicestershire, with off-spinner Peter Such getting into the record books for the huge number of overs he delivered. Essex themselves were in that position yesterday, but their last six wickets got them only as far as half an hour after lunch. </p> <p>It's true that the victory target of 348 was one the county game will regard as unlikely, but this is a good surface: well grassed and very dry, and consistent bounce. Batsmen who play strokes can race along, as Stuart Law did on Friday evening, when he and Paul Grayson took Essex to 123 before the second wicket fell. In retrospect, the express slip catch taken by Martyn Ball to end Law's innings may have been critical. </p> <p>On that same pitch yesterday, Essex scored 102 - and captain Ronnie Irani got just 28 of them. The previous evening he had struck his first ball for four, but was to hit only two more yesterday in the course of another two and half hour's batting. He never looked as if he was in much trouble, but seemed unwilling to force the pace. Perhaps he reasoned that he would provide the backbone and others would play the shots. </p> <p>Stephen Peters was starting to do that before he was splendidly taken low down at third slip by the 40-year-old Kim Barnett. Before long, 163 for five became 188 for seven, and the writing on the wall was writ large. The second of those wickets saw Barry Hyam looking a bit bemused as the bounce from off-spinner Jeremy Snape saw the ball brushing the bat's shoulder and floating to first slip. </p> <p>Danny Law had different ideas. Facing Snape in the over before lunch, he jumped out to hoist the second ball for a very long six over long-on. After blocking the next ball, he repeated his six off the fourth ball. </p> <p>After lunch, an on-side clip by Law found the safe hands, low down, of Chris Taylor at midwicket, and in another 20 minutes Gloucestershire had wrapped up a 104-run victory. They may have been last in the Second Division at the start of the day, but such is the congestion just above them that, come tomorrow, they're likely to be fewer than 10 points from third place. </p> <p>Discipline was what their coach John Bracewell was looking for, and he got it. Gloucestershire batsmen had five partnerships worth 40 or more, Essex just one. The bowling of Ball, in particular, was splendidly controlled, and the catching outstanding throughout the match. </p> <p>Control is an attribute that serves Gloucestershire so well in their one-day campaigns. So they were, in a sense, also brushing up for next Saturday and the NatWest final.</p>",

  "Danny O'Connor has only one place in his native Larne where he can buy a drink to celebrate the thirtieth birthday of the Social Democratic and Labour Party tomorrow. The party's first ever Assembly member for loyalist-dominated East Antrim will have to confine himself to the local Catholic parish hall if he wants to uncork a bottle and toast the SDLP's founding fathers. <p>For Catholics in Larne, the port town which has witnessed an upsurge in sectarian attacks over the past fortnight, do not drink in the town at night for fear of being beaten up, or even killed, by loyalist gangs. To them, the area's pubs and clubs are no-go areas. </p> <p>O'Connor himself has been at the sharp end of loyalist aggression since he was first elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1998. His home has been attacked 12 times since the Good Friday Agreement was signed, and last week his brother's house was petrol bombed. </p> <p>Yet this burly 35-year-old former security guard personifies the SDLP's best strategy to preserve its status as the principal nationalist party of Northern Ireland in face of a formidable threat from Sinn Fein. </p> <p>His working-class roots challenge the stereotype of the SDLP simply being the party of the Catholic middles classes - teachers, solicitors and doctors. Elected to a constituency with an overwhelming Protestant majority, east of the river Bann, his success gives his party some hope that it can keep the IRA's political wing at bay. O'Connor has attracted the first preference votes of former Alliance Party voters and even second and third preference transfers from pro-Agreement Ulster Unionists - something Sinn Fein finds impossible to achieve outside the nationalist electorate. </p> <p>The SDLP Assemblyman's office is a monument to the bigotry that blights Larne. The town has strong historical ties to hardline loyalism dating back to 1912, when the original Ulster Volunteer Force landed 30,000 rifles from the Clyde valley to arm people willing violently to resist Home Rule in Ireland. The windows of the office, above butchers' shop in Main Street, are bullet proof. There are scrapes and marks on the panes from the countless bricks, bottles and ball bearings fired at the SDLP base. </p> <p>Inside last Friday afternoon O'Connor was counselling nervous Catholic families whose homes were petrol bombed last week during an orgy of sectarian intimidation across the town organised by the Ulster Defence Association. </p> <p>Under siege from extreme loyalists, O'Connor takes comfort from the framed photograph on the wall of the American civil rights leader, Martin Luther King , one of his greatest heroes. His other hero is the SDLP leader, John Hume. </p> <p>'There are two reasons why I joined the party seven years ago, he said. 'I used to work as a security guard at Shorts [aircraft factory] and I remember the day that loyalists shot up a minibus full of contract workers who were painting and decorating at the plant. These were guys I used to let into the factory in east Belfast every morning and say hello or good morning to. And then, when that gun attack happened, one of them was dead, wrapped in a blanket that barely covered him. The others were badly injured. </p> <p>'I thought something should be done to stop this madness.' </p> <p>The shooting happened in 1993, when Hume was talking to Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams in an attempt to persuade republicans to give up violence. </p> <p>'John was coming under considerable pressure and criticism but I will never forget watching the relatives of the victims of the Greysteel massacre coming over to him at the funerals and telling him he had their full support to keep on talking. I remember Hume breaking down in tears and that's when I knew I had to join the party,' he said. </p> <p>Like many SDLP representatives living in mainly loyalist areas, O'Connor paid the price for entering politics. Some of the party's early leaders were victims of both loyalist and republican intimidation. Austin Currie, now a Fine Gael TD in Dublin, suffered attacks from the UVF and the IRA. Loyalists bombed Seamus Mallon's home. Former leader Gerry Fitt had to force an IRA-inspired mob out of his house at gunpoint after they broke into his home threatening him and his family. As he waved his legally-held gun at the intruders, one of them shouted: 'Look, he's a coward, he's got a gun.' Worst of all Lord Fitt's friend Senator Paddy Wilson and his friend Irene Andrews were stabbed to death in a frenzied knife attack. </p> <p>O'Connor accepted the risks of being a nationalist representative in a loyalist stronghold. 'The first cases I dealt with were Catholic constituents being burnt out of their homes. The people I represent are under attack and that means I have to stand firm and keep going.' </p> <p>He blames the East Antrim UDA for orchestrating most of the violence directed against him, his family and his constituents. The RUC have told him he is on a loyalist death list. Yet he has founded the first branch of the SDLP in Larne and predicts that the party will elect more councillors to the local borough council next May. </p> <p>West of the Bann, the party is fighting a rearguard struggle against a highly organised, disciplined and well-financed Sinn Fein. In Westminster constituencies such as West Tyrone, it is Sinn Fein rather than the SDLP which is seen as the main challenger to the sitting Unionist MPs. But east of the river dividing Northern Ireland, John Hume's party is clearly making inroads into the Alliance vote and gaining fresh support from the new Catholic middle-class emerging in areas that were once 100 per cent unionist. </p> <p>Optimistically, O'Connor dismisses the prophets of doom who predict the demise of the SDLP and the further rise of Sinn Fein. </p> <p>'The Agreement was pure SDLP politics in practice, compromise and common sense. They've been arguing for a settlement like this for 30 years long before Sinn Fein started to get into real politics. Unlike Sinn Fein I can reach out to others beyond nationalism, to people from Unionist and Alliance backgrounds that voted for the Agreement. All republican violence achieved over 25 years was to drive people further apart.'</p>",
  "<p>It's the first thing American journalists do when they arrive in Britain. They sniff and lament 'your terrible tabloids'.

'Love-starved and lonely - Chelsea: Mom and Dad Ruined My Life'. Plus Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston's honeymoon secrets. The National Enquirer fights back with a TV chat show host's 'shocking three-year love affair', Oscar-winner Helen Hunt 'dumping her hubby', and Britney's predictably 'shocking night out' at a 'New York hot spot'. </p> <p> But the Plastic Palm, as so often, goes to Weekly World News, which specialises in raw meat. 'Jimmy Hoffa was turned into Dog Food.' 'Stupid hunter shot and killed - by a MOOSE.' </p> <p>Some of these tales, I'm sure, will have been on sale at a newsagent's near you. The market in Hollywood gossip is global (and well serviced by some of Fleet Street's former finest, now operating from Florida and California). But some - lacking the libel protection of the First Amendment beyond America's frontiers - are for domestic consumption only. The appetite for them, if waning a touch, is gargantuan - counted in tens of millions. The Enquirer claims to sell around 3 million copies every week, reaching 18 million readers: which would make it the biggest newspaper in the US - if anyone thought of it as a newspaper. </p> <p>There's the difference. History and geography gave British newspapers a small, densely populated island with good rail connections. That meant, among other things, mass-selling daily tabloids, delivered to the breakfast table in a market that sustains variety. </p> <p>History and geography, equally, turned America's scandal tabloids into national weeklies and gave them a distribution separateness as close as the nearest shopping basket. The Enquirer and the rest don't need to worry about mainstream news or sport. They're free to plough a narrower patch of field while the editors of 'proper' papers pretend they don't exist. </p> <p>The stark fact, though, is that a tabloid market does inescapably exist in every developed country. In Spain or Italy, as in much of Europe, the drug comes in magazine form, full of glossy pictures of B-list movie stars and C-list aristocracy. Germany manages a pale shadow of the UK situation. In France, the scandal sheets are weeklies. </p> <p>Are we blessed or blighted in Britain? Are American visitors wrong to curl their lips? Take two arguments. First, the American tabloids contain no news - it is not their business. But their readership figures show a keen public demand for the basic, and basically written, fare they offer. No wonder editors complain that America is losing the newspaper habit. </p> <p>And, second, there's the question of standards. Consider that Chelsea Clinton story from the Globe . 'I have no friends, no boyfriends and no life,' a 'heartbroken Chelsea complained to a pal'. She 'just wants to have someone her own age to love'. </p> <p>Here's the typical stew of 'pals' and anonymous 'insiders'. Do they exist? Probably. Have they any special insights? No. We're riding through Rentaquote County. </p> <p>Page after page on the pharmacy stand wouldn't see the light of day in Britain. Page after page runs straightforwardly foul of Press Complaints Commission edict. But America has no PCC, and barely a press council. The posher papers resist any attempt to agree a code of practice because they think it will curb their First Amendment rights. </p> <p>There is, thus, not a chance that the Enquirers and Examiners will be brought under any sort of control. They can go on their own way. And the newspaper industry's men in respectable suits turn their backs. </p> <p>Wonderful freedom? Organised hypocrisy? Take your pick. But don't endure too many high-minded lectures without tossing a point or two in the other direction.</p>",
  "<p>I am not sure any of us need to be cooking at this point in the year. Time to switch off and chill. If I am to be caught within six feet of a cooker, it will be in the cool of the early morning, boiling dried beans or potatoes for a salad for lunch, long before the sun comes overhead and turns my kitchen skylights into magnifying glasses. (Leave the Sunday papers on the table and you could start a small fire.) By nine o'clock, the hob is off and the bones of lunch are cooling. </p> <p>Once you have spooned up pale-green flageolet beans tossed with verdant olive oil and a bunch of parsley while they were still warm, you may wonder how our national bean salad - kidney beans, sweetcorn and raw green pepper - ever came to be. It shouldn't have. That salad is a recipe filled with hate if ever there was one. </p> <p>Get a bean salad right - warm, tiny beans, peppery oil, a barrowload of herbs - and you could, if you close your eyes tightly, be on a sun-dappled terraced in Tuscany. Get it wrong - tinned maroon beans, chilli powder, that wretched tinned sweetcorn, and still cold from the fridge - and you could be in a motorway service station salad bar on the M25. </p> <p>The long, oval beans such as cannellini and flageolet that resemble those liqourice torpedos you used to get from the sweet shop (remember sweet shops?) are an elegant start. Like potatoes, they need dressing while they're hot. The wise will take advantage of the fact that warm starch sponges up oil or mayonnaise and becomes silky and pleasing in the mouth. Season your beans at this point, and no earlier - adding salt to the cooking water will only turn them to pebbles. If I haven't made my dressing by the time the beans are cooked, I usually drain them and shake a glug or two of oil and a twist of salt and pepper over them. They will then wait contendedly, without drying up, till I get my act together. </p> <p>If it is to be a dish of beans for lunch, then we had better go to town with the rest. The most gorgeous, glistening, slow-glugging oil from a single estate will, for once, show its true colours. Too often, expensive oils are used to little effect. This, on bruschetta and warm green vegetables, is the place to show them off. Some fine vinegar - the Spanish Forum brand is nicely rounded - and handfuls, armfuls, bucketfuls of fresh herbs are a good start. </p> <p>Parsley, so misunderstood, has an affinity with beans, much as it does with potatoes. Basil too. It makes them look interesting and adds a bolt of freshness to their mealy depths. You could stop here and you would still have had a good time, but if a bowl of beans, oil, vinegar and parsley sounds more penance than pleasure, you will need to go shopping. Tuna, tinned - look out for the pale and interesting Ortiz brand white variety - or a thick slice of the fresh fish lightly grilled is a choice steeped in tradition. Grilled salmon, which is not, is surprisingly good here, and looks cool and summery too. Actually, most fish are happy in a bean dish. </p> <p>You cannot go wrong with fish and beans - just think of the robust delights of cod and lentils. Some squid grilled till it blackens here and there will add a change of texture and welcome smokiness. I would add lemon rather than vinegar and perhaps ditch half the parsley in favour of coriander. Suddenly things start to taste as if we are on holiday. </p> <p>Meat and beans are all right if we stick to bacon and ham (or duck), though we are in danger of spending too much time at the stove. Some chopped pancetta, fried slowly so that it uses its own fat, is probably the carnivore's best bet. I wouldn't do it too early, however, despite what I said before, in case it gets a bit tough. I will do a modicum of cooking in this weather, but don't ask me to chew as well. </p> <p>I think we need some bitterness here, either in the form of a leaf - rocket and watercress will both work, but the former adds a tantalising spikiness - or a chopped preserved lemon. Once hard to find, they now pop all over the place. Middle Eastern grocers often have ones the size of apricots, preserved in salt and sometimes a little oil. The point is they are bitter and salty and so add a double-edged interest. </p> <p>Such salads could, if they must, be used as a side dish. It seems a waste, though - surely they have enough going for them, particularly if you add fish or pancetta. They would be fine alongside grilled aubergines (slice and salt them, then rinse, pat dry and grill before dressing immediately with olive oil and lemon or some lemon-infused oil). Why not chuck in some smoked chicken if you like it, torn from its bones and cut into thick shards, or chunks of tart goat's cheese? </p> <p>To get a bit practical, these are variations on one of the few salads that benefit from being made earlier in the day - their flavour will improve and the beans become more velvety. You could make up the heart and soul of the recipes earlier, so that starch and their dressings have time to 'marry', then add the fresh leaves and quickly cooked fish or grilled meat just before you eat. That way you will be able to get the cooking out of the way before the sun is high and have a lunch that will be better, rather than worse, for being 'one I made earlier'. </p> <p> <strong> Flageolet with salmon, preserved lemons and rocket</strong> </p> <p> Enough for 2 as a main dish </p> <p>150g dried flageolet beans </p> <p>300g salmon fillet (the tail is good here) </p> <p>1 tbsp white-wine vinegar </p> <p>6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil </p> <p>a preserved (pickled) lemon </p> <p>a loosely cupped handful of coriander leaves </p> <p>2 small bunches (about 100g) rocket leaves </p> <p>Rinse the beans - they can be dusty - and check them over for any small stones, then soak them overnight in cold water. They will need a good five or six hours. Drain them, then tip into a deep pan of furiously boiling water, but adding no salt (it would make them tough). Let them cook for 10 minutes or so at a fierce boil - this is supposed to stop them from giving you wind later on - then turn them down to a rolling boil. I put a little olive oil and a few bay leaves in at this point but for no other real reason than it makes the kitchen smell good as they cook. </p> <p>If the water gets low, add some from the kettle. The time they take is anyone's guess - much depends on the age of your beans. At this time, they are certain to be last year's harvest, so they need at least 40 minutes (mine took an hour.) New season's dried beans that appear in the autumn should be tender in 20 minutes. A tender bean squashes easily between your fingers. The best way is to taste them. </p> <p>Put the salmon on a dish or grill pan and rub it lightly with oil, then cook it under an overhead grill for 10 minutes or so till the flesh is just opaque. </p> <p>To make the dressing, add the vinegar to the oil in a large mixing bowl, a grind of salt and pepper (remember that the lemon will be salty), then finely chop the lemon and roughly chop the coriander leaves, and add them both to the oil and vinegar. Pull the fish from its skin in fat chunks (I think bigger pieces are more attractive in a salad), and add them to the dressing. No need to toss yet. </p> <p>Drain the beans (you can get them ready early in the day and shake them in a little seasoned olive oil while they are warm), then toss them gently with the salmon and dressing. Try not to break up the fish. </p> <p>Pick the rocket over, discarding anything that is not in good nick, then fold the leaves tenderly into the salad and serve in the next half hour or so, before the leaves wilt in the dressing. </p> <p> <strong> Cannellini with coppa, spinach and mustard olives</strong> </p> <p> Enough for 2 as a light lunch with bread </p> <p>150g dried cannellini beans </p> <p><strong> for the olives</strong> </p> <p>100g black olives </p> <p>5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil </p> <p>1 tbsp of red-wine vinegar </p> <p>1 tbsp smooth Dijon mustard </p> <p>1 tsp thyme leaves, chopped </p> <p>4 handfuls of small spinach or watercress leaves </p> <p>75g thinly sliced coppa or other cured meat </p> <p>a loose handful of basil leaves (thick and pungent) </p> <p>Cook the beans to tenderness in a large, deep pan of boiling, unsalted water. They will take from 25 minutes to one hour, and are ready when you can easily crush them between finger and thumb, but they should retain a bit of 'bite'. Drain them and toss them with the olives and their dressing, below. </p> <p>While the beans are cooking, mix the olive oil, vinegar and mustard with a fork in a small bowl, then whisk in the chopped thyme and some salt and pepper. The dressing will be thick and creamy. Stone the olives, dropping each into the mustard dressing as you go. Set aside for an hour or so. </p> <p>When you are ready to eat, rinse the spinach in cold water and shake it dry, removing all but the very finest stems, then put it into a large serving dish. Peel any shreds of skin from the outside of the coppa, then shred the meat into thick matchstick-width ribbons. Put them in with the spinach, separating the strips as you go. Tear the basil into small pieces, scattering them into the dish. Tip the beans, olives and dressing over, fold the ingredients gently together, then serve.</p>",
  "It's a funny idea that the euro debate is just about economics. It's an even rummer idea that this debate should be led by businessmen and settled by juggling a few numbers. The Government is trying to make it all as dull as ditch water. We are given five economic tests that are as boring as they are vague. We are told that all the big questions have been settled, and now all we have to do is to wait patiently until a few economic figures have come into line and all can go ahead. <p>Is this the same euro that I have been reading about on the continent? Is this the currency that will launch Europe firmly on passage to political union? Is this the self-same euro that will end wars, create a new political structure and pioneer a United States of Europe? On the continent they have not been frightened to raise the rhetorical ceiling. This is a single currency that has never been knowingly undersold by French or German leaders. They see it is as crucial to the new powerful Europe they want to create. Indeed the economic details to them are a bit of a nuisance. </p> <p>The British Government says it sees no constitutional barrier to joining the euro. It concedes that there will be some transfer of power from the UK to the European institutions, but do not seem to mind about this. They should realise that this is a huge step which the public will want to debate. People need reasons why it is a good idea to transfer these powers. </p> <p>At the moment voters hold the Government responsible for levels of unemployment, inflation and general prosperity. The Bank of England may well be more independent than it was, but everyone knows that if things went wrong the Chancellor would be called to account. He could always take the powers back or issue new instructions to the Monetary Policy Committee. British governments decide how much money to raise in taxes, how much to spend, how much to borrow. Interest rates are set for British conditions. Businesses and individuals who do not like the policy know how to lobby for a change. </p> <p>In the world of the euro all these things are altered. The power to set interest rates and to decide how much money should be in circulation rests with the European Central Bank, whether it is working for us or not. The UK government would come under more and more control over how much it can spend and borrow. The European Union plans new Europe-wide taxes on energy, on landfill waste, on business and on savings. Writing to your MP or arguing with the Chancellor would be a waste of time. </p> <p>European visionaries say that the nation state is too small and old fashioned. They want us to become an important region in a new European area, with one central European government taking more and more decisions for us. They think the old nationalisms of Europe are dangerous, whilst the new united nationalism of the EU is seen as a beneficial force in the world. They like the idea of one interest rate to fit all. They want more Europe-wide taxes to meet environmental, social and business objectives. They look forward to a strong European foreign policy backed up by European forces, so we collectively have clout on the international stage. </p> <p>Why doesn't the British Government set out this vision? This is the cause they are aiding and abetting by stealth. Some of their own supporters believe in it. Shouldn't we see and hear the government leading it, as their French and German opposite numbers do? Those of us who disagree are not extreme because we wish to keep a parliamentary democracy in these islands. It does not make us far Right because we are worried about how such mighty European power might be wielded. We have genuine doubts on whether the Western European peoples in general, and the British in particular, are ready to be governed by a Brussels government which we do not directly elect. Most of my worries about the European constitutional scheme are shared by many Labour supporters. </p> <p>The British Government keeps implying that the currency is just a business issue, and that business should lead the debate. Trying to contain the debate to commercial matters has led to many a pro-euro U-turn. First we were told that the pound was a sickly currency, always devaluing against the Deutschmark. We should join the euro because it would be strong, a force to reckoned with. </p> <p>When the euro sank we were told we should join it because it was weak: it would help our exporters. No one could tell us the exchange rate for entry, which is crucial for exporters. Every new inward investment is played down, because it implies that Britain does have a future outside the euro zone. Every foreign company deciding to invest elsewhere is taken as proof that we must join the euro. It is a pathetic debate. </p> <p>It just shows that this great argument cannot and must not be left to businessmen. Any sensible British business knows that it needs to sell things to people who want to keep the pound, and has to sell to people who want to abolish the pound. Why antagonise either group in such an emotive argument by declaring a corporate view? Few British businesses have held board meetings to settle a company position, and it would be surprising if they did given the risks. </p> <p>Some senior British business people have ventured themselves to support the euro, usually without the endorsement of their boards and shareholders. They are now feeling rather rueful that their bravery has not been backed by Ministers leaping to support them. They are worried that entry at this level of the pound would be a very painful experience. Many of them are the self-same business leaders who strongly recommended we join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, only to see it do untold damage. They were wrong then, and they could be wrong again. </p> <p>I want to see some passion and robust argument injected into this big issue. Many who support my view do so because they feel our British democracy would be too badly damaged if we gave so many powers of government away. Those on the continent who argue for the euro usually do so because they want to become European instead of being Belgian or Italian, Spanish or Greek. They feel it will be better, smarter, more modern to be European. They have reason to be unhappy with their own country or its system of government. </p> <p>It is time to do justice to the European project. It is a project of economic, monetary and political union. It is time for Britain to decide whether we want to be part of a United States of Europe, or whether we wish to belong to a common market with our partners but not share a common government. Sitting on the fence is bad for us and bad for our continental colleagues. Only the Government can lead the debate. It should do so now, and it should do so honestly.</p>"
