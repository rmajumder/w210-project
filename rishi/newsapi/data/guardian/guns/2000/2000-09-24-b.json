  "<p>From The Cherry Orchard, which opened last week at the National Theatre, to A Streetcar Named Desire: suddenly, insolvent toffs are all the rage. Perhaps it's because their crises tell us something about ours. Tennessee Williams's play pitches naked privilege against brute consumerism; as incarnated by that devastating duo Blanche Dubois and Stanley Kowalski, the latter isn't an improvement on the former. </p> <p>Andy Hay's production reanimates their primal duel in an atmospheric 1940s New Orleans, where jazz tunes hang in the air like heat-haze and the neighbours argue so violently that plaster shakes down from the Kowalskis' ceiling. In a staging punctuated with blues singing from Ruby Turner as Eunice, Hay hits only a few bum notes - the incidental music, for example, can be too insistent. So can Williams's symbolism - mournful Mexicans shuffling past the window, indeed - but there's little Hay can do about that. </p> <p>The star of a proficient cast, John Sharian turns in an electrifying performance as the mercenary brother-in-law into whose lap destitute Blanche has the misfortune to fall. When blind-drunk, and having beaten his pregnant wife, Sharian's Stanley moans like a wounded animal; when triumphant, he throws his \"Ha!\" at Blanche like vitriol. Sharian balances the admirable with the ruthless in a character whose monstrousness is, until the bitter end, kept straining at its leash. </p> <p>Tara Fitzgerald as Blanche lacks Sharian's force of personality, while her good looks are too rosily robust for a woman who characterises the frail grandeur of the Deep South. But she snares Blanche's lethal combination of neediness and hauteur, and she's a fantastic flirt: the paperboy doesn't know what's hit him. </p> <p>Hay stokes up the resulting passions to such an extent that the tension surrounding his production's denouement - in which Blanche departs for the asylum under the gaze of her alienated suitor Mitch, Stella the treacherous sister and Stanley himself - positively throbs. With Blanche, thought Williams, went not just snobbery and hypocrisy, but the belief in an archaic civility. Is that a baby Stella's holding when the lights dim, or did she and Stanley just sling it out with the bathwater? </p> <p>\u0095 Until October 14. Box office: 0117-987 7877.</p>",
  "<p>Virtuoso organ concertos are rare and rarely heard. So one of the great attractions of the final of the Royal College of Organists' Performer of the Year competition was the opportunity to hear unfamiliar music played with verve. Other attractions included the contribution of the BBC Philharmonic under the spirited baton of Rumon Gamba. And in some ways the greatest attraction of all was Wayne Marshall, who cheerfully - and with a disarming lack of offensiveness - upstaged all the competitors with a stunning performance of the finale of Saint-Sa\u00ebns's Organ Symphony and a riveting 15-minute improvisation. As organist-in-residence since the hall was opened, Marshall knows its marvellous Marcussen organ inside out and can find more colours there than anybody else; his improvisation also showed an exceptional control of musical pace and harmonic colour. In his hands the future of the organ recital seems assured. </p> <p>But the three competitors also gave superb performances; you could never have guessed that none of them knew which concerto he would be playing until shortly before the concert. Jonathan Scott led off with Samuel Barber's Toccata Festivo, composed in 1960. This is a glitteringly virtuosic work that needs to be heard far more often; Scott played it with effortless skill, blending his registration miraculously with the sound of the orchestra. Nobody was surprised to learn that he won the vote of the audience. Poulenc's acerbic organ concerto is more often heard; Philip Rushforth played it with confidence but with less instinct for the orchestral sound around him. </p> <p>Rarest of all, though, was Joseph Rheinberger's Second Organ Concerto of 1894. A superb example of the soupy late-Romantic style cultivated in Germany, it is skilfully scored but far less designed for an organist to display virtuosity. Clive Driskill-Smith gave a sensitive and well-judged performance. The judges were therefore wise to make it clear that their decision to award the first prize to Driskill-Smith was based at least partly on what had happened in earlier rounds of the competition. Plainly the future of the organ concerto as a genre will depend on more composers being prepared to write works that genuinely exploit virtuosity. With players like these, though, they should find the challenge stimulating.</p>",
  "Richard Branson and Cherie Booth were destined to be successful from the age of ten. Childhood self-esteem can overwhelm academic disadvantage or social deprivation in determining future earnings power, according to major new research. <p>The research will cast serious doubt over the recent narrow focus of education experts on academic achievement in primary schools. </p> <p>'There is now clear evidence that children with higher self-esteem at age 10 get as much of a kick to their adult earning power as those with equivalent higher maths or reading ability,' said Leon Feinstein of the influential Centre for Economic Performance. </p> <p>Parents' interest in the education of their child and whether they exhibit hostility to the child are also 'hugely important'. </p> <p>A father's hostility had as much influence as the father's own academic performance. </p> <p>Feinstein and his colleagues tracked children for 30 years using the British Cohort Study, which interviewed the parents of all babies born in the UK in the first week of April 1970. The children were subsequently questioned at 5, 10, 16, 26 and as they reached their 30th birthdays earlier this year. </p> <p>Self-esteem was monitored at 10 by asking the children a series of questions, such as 'Do you think other children often say nasty things about you?' and 'Are there lots of things about yourself that you would like to change?' </p> <p>Boys in particular who were anti-social and had low self-esteem at 10 are at greater risk of unemployment in early adulthood. </p> <p>Young boys with higher self-esteem are less likely to be unemployed in later life, and for shorter periods. </p> <p>Bright children often have higher self-esteem, as do some from more affluent backgrounds. But the study compared children from similar backgrounds and still found that those who were psychologically well-balanced at 10 were now doing much better than their peers. 'For example, in the case of two children from families with low income and with parents who left school at the minimum leaving age,' said Feinstein, 'the child with higher self-esteem at age ten will earn more, even if the children have the same scores in maths and reading.' </p> <p>The research also found, surprisingly, that it is not unusual for children to have high academic achievement and low self-esteem, leading to significant later under-performance in the jobs market. A spokesman for the British Association for Counselling said: 'Discouragement for children doesn't come only from crude parental hostility at home; it can just be resentment or the constant feeling that they're making you tired. Children pick that up. </p> <p>'It isn't just less well-off children who suffer. All too often you can ask affluent parents who the important people in their child's life are - teachers, friends and so on - and they haven't a clue. There's nothing so deprived as a child with a nanny and a pot of cash. </p> <p>'We've been missing the point that parenting skills in this country, like many other craft skills, are on the wane.' </p> <p>The Virgin entrepreneur Richard Branson, the son of a judge, came from an affluent and supportive upper middle- class family. </p> <p>However, he always underperformed academically. </p> <p>He went on to become one of the 20 richest men in Britain. Cherie Booth grew up in a relatively poor family with little academic background but significant emotional support from her mother Gale. </p> <p>She is now one of Britain's most dist-inguished barristers, reportedly earning \u00a3250,000 a year. </p> <p>A string of other highly successful people underperformed at school but, boosted by self-confidence from an early age, have become successful in their chosen careers. </p> <p>Alan Sugar, Lynne Franks and Max Clifford all had limited conventional academic success but supportive families and developed social skills at an early age. </p> <p>'There may now be grounds for arguing that school performance should be assessed not only in terms of maths, reading or science scores but also in terms of the success or failure of helping children to develop in other ways,' said Feinstein. </p> <p>'Schools are geared to helping pupils achieve good key stage and exam scores. </p> <p>'They are not institutions created to help individual children to achieve their psychological growth.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk\">ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk</a> </p> <p><b>Four success stories against the odds</b> <br> Cherie Blair<br> Highly successful QC, wife of Prime Minister, mother of four children. <br> In spite of ...

  "<p>Had Clint Eastwood asked me to devise an SF western that would provide him with an epic role befitting his mature years I'd have suggested a space version of King Lear. </p> <p>As a galactic emperor touched with Alzheimer's, he'd divide his universe between his daughters. Then, as he flits from sphere to sphere with his rowdy entourage, the ungrateful daughters would take away his spacecraft, stranding Clint on a barren planet with a few eccentric courtiers. </p> <p>Inevitably, star wars break out, the good forces led by the rejected good daughter (a strong role for Sondra Locke here) and a family struggle for control of the galaxy ensues. </p> <p>He didn't consult me and instead, presumably influenced by the celebratory return to space made by the 77-year-old John Glenn on the Discovery shuttle two years ago, chose to make Space Cowboys, starring himself in his seventieth year, the 72-year-old James Garner, the 66-year-old Donald Sutherland and the 54-year-old Tommy Lee Jones as a marvellous bunch of superannuated astronauts. </p> <p>It's a hi-tech action comedy-drama, an artful cross between The Right Stuff, Armageddon, The Magnificent Seven and The Sunshine Boys, an entertaining spin on the traditional 'Last Big Mission' yarn. Usually, Hollywood ignores the ages of its increasingly elderly romantic male stars. Here, age becomes the point of the jokes and the pathos. </p> <p>The opening sequence invokes The Right Stuff. In nostalgic black-and-white, a quartet of young air force pilots called the Daedalus team push the envelope over the Californian desert in 1958 in preparation for an expedition into space. </p> <p>But the project is called off. A monkey is sent in their place (anticipating Eastwood's co-starring role with Clyde, the orang-utan in Every Which Way But Loose) and the USAF hands over its operations to the newly created Nasa. Unlike Daedalus and Icarus, the four never get into orbit. </p> <p>Forty years later, their chance comes again. Ikon, a vital Russian satellite, has gone out of control and must be kept in space. Its outdated guidance system was stolen from Nasa by Soviet spies and the only person capable of supervising the repair job is its designer, retired Colonel Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood), maverick leader of the Daedalus team. </p> <p>But confronted by his old enemy, devious bureaucrat and wingless eagle Bob Gerson (James Cromwell), he refuses to take on the task without his old Daedalus buddies. Like Yul Brynner putting together his band of gunfighters, Corvin searches out his old mates in their new habitats. </p> <p>The ace navigator, Tank Sullivan (James Garner), has become a Baptist preacher and confers with his God for three seconds before accepting. The incomparable engineer, white-maned amorist Jerry O'Neill (Donald Sutherland), who now designs rollercoasters, needs little pressing. Corvin's reckless rival and former co-pilot, Hawk Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), now flying a cropdusting biplane, initially turns the offer down, but it may well be that Jones himself needed persuading to play someone at least a decade older than himself without resort to make-up. </p> <p>The best scenes are to be found in the early stages. The quartet in their leather jackets and shades striding confidently towards the Lyndon Johnson Building at Nasa's Houston headquarters is a glorious sight - men feeling they're needed once again, being given the chance to fulfil a dream they thought had been denied them. 'We've got three weeks to send four old farts into space,' says flight director William Devane, restoring reality, and the quartet's medical testing and flight training are both comic and poignant. </p> <p>They know that if they can't cut it, they'll be replaced by the fit, technically advanced young astronauts who view them with open contempt. But the old guys are in charge of making this picture. They get the best lines and (which is dramatically unfair and seriously weakens a grand movie) the youngsters go largely uncharacterised. The old guys also get the best girls (doctor Blair Brown, scientist Marcia Gay Harden, feisty wife Barbara Babcock), though when Eastwood, having a barroom row with Jones, asks a waitress: 'Which of us would you like to take home?', she replies, quizzically: 'To the retirement home?' </p> <p>The excitement becomes more conventional when the astronauts are eventually launched into space. Nevertheless, the tensions are well sustained and there are effective surprises and final nods towards Dr Strangelove. It is no surprise, however, that our elderly heroes acquit themselves rather better than the two young astronauts who accompany them on the mission. </p> <p>The nice thing about the movie is that apart from some mildly barbed stuff about the callowness of youth, the mendacity of bureaucrats and the grim legacy of the Soviet Union, it's full of human warmth and good humour. There's no bitterness, no rancour and a merciful absence of triumphalism, sentimentality and flag-waving. Space Cowboys is a movie for those who prefer Budweiser and Jack Daniel's to summer wine.</p>",
  "<p>Empowerment. That was the buzzword du jour when internet access started to spread like wildfire into homes and offices; with everything from online news services to stock-market prices to 24-hour Loch Ness cams just a click of the mouse and a bout of RSI away, instant-access information, cried the soothsayers, would set us free. In reality, as we wait hours for grainy movie trailers and grainier porn sites to download, only to be thwarted by the latest system crash, we're slaves to the PC, rather than the other way round. There is, however, one online area in which we haven't only grasped the reins of power, but we're also yanking them to breaking point; everyone, it seems, is now a critic. </p> <p>With hindsight, it was inevitable. The net's innumerable chat rooms and bulletin boards are the perfect arenas for opinionated outpourings previously confined to the pub, the mirror or the analyst's couch. Take film, for instance. A profusion of amateur one-man reviewing sites has sprung up, including the emblematically named oneguysopinion.com, run by Dr Frank Swietek, a professor of history at the University of Dallas, who, as he cautions, is a 'particularly tough grader'. He then shows us what he means, awarding this summer's blockbuster X-Men a D+, and describing it as 'dull, absurd and x-ecrable'. Then there's crankycritic.com, the brainchild of Chuck Schwartz, a former radio 'shock jock' who critiques movies 'solely on price value' - thus, an $8 rating means 'See it twice,' $5 is a 'Date movie or matinee' and $0 just 'Wretched'. (For the record, he gives X-Men an $8). </p> <p>The likes of Swietek and Schwartz are mere pretenders compared to Harry Knowles, though. His <a href=\"http://www.aintitcoolnews.com\">aintitcoolnews.com</a>, with its mix of advance screenplay leaks, private/test screening reviews, and salacious gossip ('Mark Wahlberg to shag a gorilla in Planet of the Apes?'), receives around 400,000 hits a day. Such is the clout of Knowles and his anonymous contributors - rejoicing in CB-style monikers such as Source and Firesky - that their righteous pre-release demolition of clunkers like Batman &amp; Robin and Eyes Wide Shut was cited as a major factor in their box-office bombing.</p> <p>Once regarded as a pariah by the industry, the 285lb, red-bearded Knowles, who lives with his father and sister in Austin, Texas is now sent scripts and called for advice by studio chiefs; he's also appeared on kosher critic Roger Ebert's US TV show and had a cameo alongside Salma Hayek, in his new best friend Robert Rodriguez's movie, The Faculty. </p> <p>Red meat though these sites may be, they at least restrict their pontificating to current releases, but sites like the Internet Movie Database and Amazon are finding their film and video archive sections at the mercy of surfers determined to Think The Unthinkable - their spirited assaults on sacred cows show that nothing is, well, sacred. Citizen Kane 's official Critical Consensus as Best Movie of all Time, for example, is instantly shattered by 'Tyler from Madison', who reckons: 'It blows! If you want to know what the real best movie of all time is,' he goes on, 'it's Top Gun.' </p> <p>Fair enough - but surely The Godfather is untouchable? 'Jim from Laguna Beach' mixes his metaphors for many: 'In the genre of the classic gangster film,' he intones, ' The Godfather lies at its pinnacle.' But Tony from Seattle reckons 'it would have been better if Joe Pesci had been in it'. What, then, of the most portentous of them all, Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal? The tale of the knight who gambles his soul on a chess game with Death doesn't attract fans as much as True Believers, but Philip from North Carolina is emphatically not among them: 'Man is it boring! The only thing that Bergman seems to say is that chess is boring! I hate chess! Black-and-white movies have always been dumb. See Raw Deal with Arnold Schwarzenegger instead. Nobody gives him a raw deal - even an ugly bald guy in a black robe.' </p> <p>But if all this weren't reappraisal enough, the readers' book reviews on Amazon (which is so enthusiastic about the practice that it has a Top 1,000 reviewer chart) take literary criticism into dimensions that the namby-pamby likes of FR Leavis certainly forbore to tread. The Bible? 'Poor continuity, major holes in a preposterous plot, and stock, undeveloped characters,' thunders Diogenes from White Plains. Shakespeare may have his supporters ('This Complete Works set simply embodies the essence of Shakesphere's [sic] unique style of playwrite [sic],' writes a fan from Tennessee), but Jeremy from Claremont points up an area that could be ripe for future scholarly study - continuity flaws: 'Hello Shakespeare, is anyone home? Most people will say that I didn't understand it, but I totally did. The fight scenes were totally unrealistic. And Hamlet, hello? Like, a ghost, living?' </p> <p>On one cultural colossus, though, unanimity is finally reached: 'A masterpiece that will survive any re-evaluation in the coming decades,' raves Jacques from France. 'No one can understand what is happening in American society and in the world if they do not read this milestone fictional vision.' American Psycho , it seems, is virtually alone in being new-critic-proof. 'I AM PATRICK BATEMAN,' yell a disquieting number of reviewers. Perhaps, after all, a little empowerment is a dangerous thing.</p>",
  "<p>Ray Winstone has no problems playing a cop. 'I'm an actor. It's like how comfortable did I feel playing a wife-beater, or a child molester, or a junkie? It's what you do.' Sure, it's stereotyping, but Winstone has been more often seen on the other side of the law. In the impressively complex ITV drama Tough Love Winstone is excellent as a detective trying to work out if his best friend and boss (Adrian Dunbar) is bent. The show dabbles in all sorts of topical issues, from child abduction to zero tolerance. </p> <p>More than just playing a cop, Winstone is playing a cop with a Northern accent. At the age of 43, this is only the second time Winstone has strayed from his native London tones. 'I was never asked to do accents before, but by the time I got to an age when I was asked to do one, I was a bit bottley, because I thought \"can't do it\". Don't think they even really wanted me to do Mancunian, but it should be, it's gotta be.' </p> <p>Winstone has become a bit of an icon in recent years.In a film and TV world packed with mockneys, he is the real thing: Hackney-born, Enfield-raised, a lifelong West Ham fan whose parents sold fruit and veg. He was an amateur boxer as a teenager. 'I had 88 fights and I had a doctor say to me: there's no way you can do 88 fights and not be damaged.' After boxing he tried drama school; he was about to be kicked out when the visionary TV director Alan Clarke cast him in the borstal drama Scum (1977). </p> <p>The Clarke connection came good 20 years later when fellow Clarke-alumnus Gary Oldman wrote the role of a wife-beater in Nil By Mouth (1997) for Winstone, even though the two had never met. It changed Winstone's life. 'I was seeing people who wouldn't employ me three years earlier. I haven't got any hang-ups about that. But I was piddling about before.' Despite the subject matter, he loved doing the film. 'It was a doddle. I don't take it home. How can you take home beating up Kathy Burke? Go home to the wife: \"Cup of tea, dear?\" \"No, you can't have one.\" Smash! Fucking leave off: I'd be divorced... 'Course, I could be lying to you.' </p> <p>Another Clarke disciple, Tim Roth, chose him to play the abusive father in The War Zone . Winstone found that tougher, but not troubling. 'Good therapy. I know I've got no worries with myself.' Of course, there has been less celebrated stuff, most recently the much-ridiculed films Final Cut and Love, Honour And Obey. But given the chance, he's a fearless and brilliant actor. Right now, he's appearing on stage for the first time in four years at the Donmar Warehouse in To The Green Fields And Beyond, directed by Sam Mendes. 'It's fucking killing me. It's great. I just needed to go back and learn something. In one way you're going, \"Am I completely insane?\" But at the end of the day, it's only a fucking play. People in China won't know it's going on.' </p> <p>No, if they know him in China at all, it will be, like the rest of the world, for playing Will Scarlet in the Eighties TV series Robin Of Sherwood. 'Think it was Germany, they put a right mincer's voice on my voice. My wife showed me it - fucking destroyed me, a psychotic mincer! I'm quite proud of Robin Of Sherwood, had three great years of it. Will Scarlet: the first football hooligan. Brilliant.' </p> <p><strong>Five things you should know about Ray Winstone </strong></p> <p>1 His early acting heroes were James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson and John Wayne.</p> <p>2 His approach to acting: 'I don't want to be seen giving a performance. People say, \"He's just talking, being himself.\" Excuse me, there is a script. But it should sound like you're just talking.'</p> <p>3 He has been married to his wife Elaine since 1979</p> <p>4 'What am I afraid of? The dark, but I've beaten that. Spiders: don't kill 'em, but don't like them big hairy things.'</p> <p>5 He's '100 per cent behind' the recent fuel protests.</p>",
  "<p><strong> 1 Wonder Boys </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Frances McDormand, Robert Downey Jr </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Michael Douglas acts his age </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Adapted from Michael Chabon's novel, it's a freewhelling film about a crumbling novelist/lecturer (Douglas), his lover (McDormand), his star student (Maguire) and his very camp agent (Downey). The action takes place over the course of a wild weekend after his exasperated wife leaves him, and Douglas embarks on a substance-fuelled journey of discovery aided and abetted by Maguire, his oddball star writing pupil. Douglas is no stranger to playing morally compromised characters (Fatal Attraction, Wall Street), and is alternately charming and childish in the lead. It is director Curtis Hanson's first film since LA Confidential and is something of a labour of love for the journeyman-turned-A list auteur. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> This low-key film isn't exactly what everyone was expecting after the scale and complexity of LA Confidential , but it has a wonderful cast and witty script. About to get a re-release in the States for the awards season, Maguire cements his reputation as a shining young talent and could be in line for the Oscar nod he deserved last year for Ride With the Devil. (Opens in November) </p> <p> <strong> 2 In The Mood For Love </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Brief Encounter in Hong Kong </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Beautifully shot Sixties-set love story directed by Wong Kar Wei, about neighbours who suspect that their respective spouses are having an affair, and the restrained relationship that emerges. An atmospheric story that will delight and beguile the director's fans. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> Many critics thought that this, not Dancer In The Dark , was the best film at Cannes. Will only enhance Wong Kar Wei's hefty reputation. (Opens in October) </p> <p> <strong> 3 Memento </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne Moss </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Oliver Sacks meets Kubrick </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> In what is surely the most stylistically daring film of the season a man (Pearce) suffering from continual memory loss tries to reconstruct the events surrounding his wife's death. What's more, the story is told backwards. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> The few people who saw director Christopher Nolan's debut, Following, raved about it. The star power here, added to Nolan's talent, should get him a decent audience. (Opens in October) </p> <p> <strong> 4 Billy Elliot </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Jamie Bell, Julie Walters </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Ken Loach does West Side Story </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Theatre wunderkind Stephen Daldry follows Sam Mendes's footsteps with a high-profile debut film. In this case, the story of a boy (Bell) in a pit village during the miners' strike who nurtures the unlikely dream of being a ballet dancer. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> The set-up sounds like a comedy sketch, but the film went down a storm at Cannes and Edinburgh. Possibly the best British film of the year. (Opens next week) </p> <p> <strong> 5 The Way Of The Gun </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Benecio Del Toro, Ryan Phillipe, James Caan, Juliette Lewis </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Peckinpah with twists </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> A thriller every bit as complicated as you would expect of the directorial debut from the writer of The Usual Suspects to be. Del Toro and Phillipe are the bad guys who kidnap pregnant surrogate mother Juliette Lewis, not realising who she's connected to. And that's very much only the start </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> There hasn't been a big American crime movie for a while, and it could be this one. (Opens in November) </p> <p> <strong> 6 Girlfight </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Michelle Rodriguez, Jaime Tirelli, Santiago Douglas, Paul Calderon </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> The feminist Rocky </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Bracingly realist tale of a teenager from the South Bronx (Rodriguez) who decides she wants to box, despite the opposition of her abusive father (Calderon) and the boxing authorities. Made by first time director Karyn Kusama and with a first-time actress as the star. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> The indie movie of the autumn: Rodriguez is truly sensational. (Opens in November) </p> <p> <strong> 7 Road Trip </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Breckin Meyer, Tom Green, Amy Smart </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> The Sure Thing collides with Animal House </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Cheerfully dumb (but not stupid) comedy about a college kid (Meyer) and his mates chasing across the US in search of a misplaced video of him having sex with the wrong girl. Drugs, frat houses, sex-obsessed pensioners and snakes are involved </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> Good. It is by far the best of the recent run of grossout comedies. (Opens in October) </p> <p> <strong> 8 The Yards </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Mark Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix, Charlize Theron, James Caan </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Mean Streets revisited </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Grimy story of crime, corruption and (of course) loyalty in New York City, with Wahlberg as the guy just back from serving time for the crime he didn't commit, and swiftly getting involved in more dubious situations. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> It had a great buzz at Cannes, but that only means so much. Wahlberg and Phoenix were both in huge summer hits, and New York crime stories never go out of style. (Opens in November) </p> <p> <strong> 9 Black And White </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Power, Robert Downey Jr, Mike Tyson, Ben Stiller, Bijou Phillips </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> A socio-anthropology essay in which Claudia Schiffer takes her clothes off </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Friend-of-the-stars James Toback enticed Tyson, Schiffer, Brooke Shields and the Wu-Tang Clan to appear in this sprawling satire about race relations, threesomes, the music business and sports in contemporary Manhattan </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> Add hip hop and boxing fans to the plain curious and you should have an audience for Toback's fascinating but uneven film. (Opens in November) </p> <p> <strong> 10 House Of Mirth </strong></p> <p><strong> The stars: </strong> Gillian Anderson, Eric Stoltz, Dan Ackroyd </p> <p><strong> The pitch: </strong> Gillian Anderson does costume drama </p> <p><strong> What it is: </strong> Typical Edith Wharton tale of a woman (Anderson) overstepping the bounds of polite society. Notable for the unusual casting (Dan Ackroyd) and the distinctive British director Terence Davies. </p> <p><strong> The prospects: </strong> An intriguing mix of elements makes for a very interesting proposition. Now if Anderson's fanbase can be persuaded to see it, we might have the weirdest hit of the year. (Opens in October)</p> <p><strong>Star of the season: Robert Downey Jnr</strong></p> <p>Or the artist formerly known as prisoner P50552 at<br>the California State Penitentiary. Early last month,<br>Downey Jnr was released after serving 12 months<br>of a three-year sentence for jumping probation on<br>drugs charges. His early release, it seemed, had a<br>good deal to do with a Vanity Fair profile which<br>detailed his life behind bars alongside the likes of<br>'Sugar Bear' and 'Big Al', not to mention the<br>attentions of a 'pre-op transexual'. </p> <p>For more than a couple of decades, the<br>35-year-old Downey Jnr's life has resembled a<br>cheap melodrama.

  "<p>We're not promising obvious fireworks. After a disappointing year, the autumn isn't offering up the usual collection of big-budget entertainment. Aside from Wonder Boys, director Curtis Hanson's impressive follow-up to LA Confidential, which stars Michael Douglas as an unravelling college professor, there are fewer familiar faces than usual. So we're left with a line-up of films that might not immediately grab your attention. But that is actually a good thing. After all, what would you rather see: a much-hyped film made by people you already know about, or something equally good from somebody completely new? </p> <p>The relative lack of cinematic big hitters with new product in the coming months means that a handful of interesting debuts - and a couple of second films from directors you're unlikely to have heard of - will have a chance of getting some attention. And they're about some unlikely subjects too: a female boxer, a boy growing up during the 1984-85 miners strike who wants to be a ballet dancer, a man with no memory. </p> <p>Let's start there. As everyone (rightly) turned on the underachieving British film industry towards the end of last year, a film called Following sneaked out. It was a black-and-white, Kubrick-influenced thriller about a man who was trailing other people. One of the producers claimed, rather pointlessly, that it was the cheapest feature film ever made in this country. But what mattered was that the few people who saw it wouldn't stop talking about it. By that point, director Christopher Nolan had already decamped to the US. The result is Memento, a film with a real budget ($10 million or so), and real stars (Guy Pearce, The Matrix 's Carrie Anne Moss). It's Nolan's chance to come good on all the promise that Following showed. Not that it is an easy film: the story - a man with no memory trying to work out how his wife died - is told backwards. But already it's generating the same kind of excitement as Following, only on a rather less subterranean scale. Proof that this country still produces truly ambitious filmmakers. </p> <p>James Gray is also on his second film: he made Little Odessa a long six years ago, without shaking the world. Yet he has pulled together an even more impressive cast nevertheless: The Yards matches the glamorous young - Mark Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix, Charlize Theron - with James Caan, Ellen Burstyn and Faye Dunaway. A moody look at crime in New York City, The Yards played well in Cannes and has a lot going for it. The question is whether Gray is reviving the spirit of gritty Seventies Hollywood, or simply recycling it. </p> <p>Using Caan seems to be the mini-trend of the season, because he's also in The Way Of The Gun. Presumably he has been forgiven for his appearance in the unspeakable Mickey Blue Eyes. Christopher McQuarrie has never directed before, but he did write The Usual Suspects. Scriptwriters are always complaining that directors are given total authorial credit for a film, for no real reason other than journalistic laziness. And it is true that you can see more of The Usual Suspects here than in the movies (Apt Pupil, X-Men) that director Bryan Singer has gone on to make. Want twists? Want plot, more plot and intriguing tangents that might or might not lead somewhere? A surfeit of style? McQuarrie is clearly your guy. </p> <p>We're far enough away from the post-Tarantino glut to greet another wordy, ostentatiously clever US thriller with excitement rather than weariness. But that's all still Hollywood. Beyond Hollywood, there still are very different worlds, or rather something a little closer to the real world. Such as a film already described in this paper as 'Ken Loach does West Side Story ' and another that could actually be tagged as a Loachian take on Rocky without bending the truth unduly. One gives a vivid sense of Britain during the miners strike(Billy Elliot), the other does the same for the Projects of the South Bronx (Girlfight). Both are debuts. </p> <p> Girlfight is directed by Karyn Kusama, but, tellingly, the executive producer is John Sayles, and it owes something to his feel for meticulous, patient realism. In truth, the plot leans a little too far to the conventional sports movie: girl wants to box, has to sneak around father's back to do so, finds mentor, confronts the backward sporting authorities, and so on. But the way the film works is anything but cliched: 22-year-old Michelle Rodriguez, who plays the central character, has never acted before. She is absolutely extraordinary. You don't doubt for a second that she could knock a guy flat, but you also buy into every conflicting emotion she has. It's the performance of the season. What's not clear is whether the film business will find a way to give Rodriguez the chances she deserves. </p> <p>As the story of a pit village boy who wants to be a ballet dancer, Billy Elliot is a similarly improbable plot within a very grounded setting. Stephen Daldry seems to be finding the switch from the theatre to film as logical as Sam Mendes did. </p> <p>The Loach theme doesn't extend to Road Trip, though. You might expect a touch of social realism when an award-winning documentary maker directs his first feature, but maybe not after you discover that Todd Phillips's Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner was called Frat House . And so, yes, his fictional debut Road Trip is a comedy about sex-obsessed college boys. But there are good obnoxious college movies and bad ones, and this is a good one. Phillips may not be a major auteur in the making in the way that Christopher Nolan is, but his grasp of pace and timingis first class. </p> <p>Of course, established directors aren't completely absent from the picture. There's Wong Kar Wei's terrific In The Mood For Love; Wonder Boys, Curtis Hanson's long awaited follow-up to LA Confidential; Terence Davies's Edith Wharton adaptation House Of Mirth, which stars Gillian Anderson; and James Toback's Black And White. But none of them will give the sense of discovery you get from Girlfight, or Memento, the feeling that this is something you haven't seen before. Which is why a seemingly quiet time for films should turn out to be very exciting after all. </p> <p><strong>The Screen awards: the season's hits (and misses)</strong></p> <p><strong>The 'aren't you a bit young' award for precocious talent</strong></p> <p>\u009514-year old Jamie Bell (above) acts and dances in Billy Elliot</p> <p>\u0095 Michelle Rodgriuez acts and punches in Girlfight</p> <p>\u0095 Posh high schoolers misbehave in Manhattan (Black and White) </p> <p><strong>Arthur Conan Doyle award for most unlikely sleuth</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu in Charlie's Angels</p> <p>\u0095 Ben Stiller in Black and White</p> <p>\u0095 Winona Ryder in Lost Souls </p> <p><strong>Tagline of the season</strong></p> <p>\u0095 'Meet the Devil.

  "<p>Adrian Griffith, the West Indian opener, might have had a pretty ordinary summer, but he did achieve one unique distinction - he was the only recognised batsman in seven Tests, including the two against Zimbabwe, to fall to an England spin bowler. </p> <p>You can be forgiven for having forgotten the dismissal - A F G Griffith lbw b Croft 54 - having come as it did during Brian Lara's blazing reaffirmation of his greatness during the third Test at Old Trafford. </p> <p>A further sign of the sorry state of English slow bowling was the selectors' decision to choose Ian Salisbury for this winter's tours of Pakistan and Sri Lanka, which may seem a bit hard on Surrey's doughty purveyor of wrist spin, but the selection of a 30-year-old whose 19 Test wickets have come at a cost of 70 runs each hardly suggests a healthy stock of gifted young spinners. And yet ... </p> <p>One of the most pleasing features of a summer of solid achievement by our junior cricketers was the contribution of the slow bowlers, who gained their success despite the fact that our pitches at all levels still tend to offer much more to those who want to charge in and bowl seam-up. </p> <p>It seems that the junior game is in more robust health than some of us have given it credit for as we mutter about the decline in cricket in state schools threatening to cause the grass roots to shrivel and die. Hugh Morris, the England Cricket Board's technical director, says there are now two million boys and girls under the age of 15 playing the game, providing plenty of raw material. 'Our responsibility is to pluck out those with the right athleticism, attitude and aptitude,' says Morris, 'and bring them into the national under-15, 17 and 19 squads.' By the end of next year he also hopes - courtesy of Lottery funding - to have an academy for players between 19 and 23 at Bisham Abbey, where 'we can polish the diamonds that we're producing through the development of excellence process'. </p> <p>Rough diamonds about to be polished include spin bowlers of genuine international class, a basic requirement for winning Test series in Asia and an important option anywhere else in the world. </p> <p>Those who saw our under-15 side reach the semi-finals of the World Cup last month reported that our bowling was particularly impressive with no fewer than three spinners making conspicuous contributions: Nottinghamshire's all-rounder Samit Patel, who bowls left arm, and off-spinners Dan Broadbent of Yorkshire and Cleveland's James Beaumont. At under-19 level, the left-arm spinner Mudhsuden 'Monty' Panesar, a fixture in England's side for the one- and four-day series against Sri Lanka, is held in the highest regard by his coaches. </p> <p>'Monty's a superb character who genuinely has a love affair with the game,' says under-19s coach Tim Boon, the former Leicestershire player. 'He will spend all day perfecting his art, which is the kind of commitment we want.' He is impressed, too, by the size of the heavily callused finger with which Panesar rips the ball. 'His little finger is longer than my longest,' he says. </p> <p>Panesar, 18, was born and raised in Luton after his parents arrived from the Punjab in the Seventies. He has already impressed playing second XI cricket for Northamptonshire, the county where the greatest of all left-arm spinners, Bishen Bedi, also a Sikh, once bowled with distinction. </p> <p>Panesar combines a determination to play Test cricket for England with an almost reverent respect for Bedi's bowling. 'He wouldn't just bowl thinking, \"I want to land it in that sort of area\", and hope that he'd succeed, he would actually get it in that area. And he used to work batsmen out so that he had a plan how to bowl to them, which is the difference between a bowler who is content just to spin the ball and a class spinner.' </p> <p>The accuracy and control of Panesar's own bowling are reflected in series figures of 73-24-200-8 in the three four-day matches against Sri Lanka, who are masters of giving spin bowlers the long handle. </p> <p>He has firm views on why England have performed so poorly at Test level in recent years: 'I don't think there's anything wrong with English cricket because there's so much talent. It's a matter of confidence. But look at it now, the England team are doing well and if they can keep that up I think it will be all right.' </p> <p>Hearteningly, Panesar, who has just been picked for the under-19 tour to India this winter, says that he has never felt held back by being of Asian origin. Nor does he believe that the reason that so few of the many Asians who play cricket in England have made it into the first-class game has anything to do with prejudice against them. 'Asian parents believed that their children should continue their education and become doctors, accountants or engineers,' he said. 'But I think now they're beginning to realise that cricket may, after all, be a career for a young Asian.' Which must be another hopeful sign for England in this rare summer of cricketing optimism. </p>",
  "<p>George Graham recently complained that the standard of defending in English football is not what it was - on the evidence of this game the same can be said of shooting, heading and passing. </p> <p>Shortly after Manchester United and Chelsea had showed what is so good about Premiership football, two of the lesser lights from those cities put on a poor display, in just about every respect. </p> <p>At least City had the satisfaction of keeping their first clean sheet of the season and spoiling Tottenham's 100 per cent home record, but it was not a game for the purists. </p> <p>The pre-match video entertainment at White Hart Lane featured Ricardo Villa's winning goal for Spurs against City in the 1981 FA Cup final. How yesterday's game cried out for that sort of inspiration. </p> <p>A first-half of huff and puff produced no shortage of penalty box action and plenty of attempts on goal, mostly from Tottenham, but their efforts were mostly high, wide or brought handsome saves from Nicky Weaver, City's young goalkeeper. Spurs dominated in terms of possession, but could not convert their pressure into goals, a commodity City have been shipping in some quantity this season. Spurs were without their captain Sol Campbell, but he was admirably replaced by Ramon Vega in the heart of defence. </p> <p>It was in midifeld that they really missed Darren Anderton, whose continued absence with groin problems has robbed Tottenham of their creativity. Time and again they lacked the telling pass or cross that would have given Sergei Rebrov or Les Ferdinand a chance to shine against a City defence that was weakened when Steve Howey limped off after 20 minutes. </p> <p>Ferdinand had a thumping shot well saved by Weaver before Steffen Iversen's header was cleared off the line in the 3rd minute. Ferdinand then had a header saved, Rebrov shot just wide and Iversen volleyed over the bar as Spurs pressed, but City held firm and almost took a surprise lead when Spurs keeper Neil Sullivan had to save with his head after an intended back pass from Steve Carr headed towards the top corner of goal. </p> <p>Tottenham's best effort came a minute into the second half, when Vega thumped a header from Ben Thatcher's cross against the crossbar. Ferdinand had another header blocked and then Weaver made a marvellous save at full-stretch to hold Iversen's powerful long-range shot. </p> <p>Until then, City had barely managed a shot on goal, but the introduction of George Weah as substitute for Paul Dickov on the hour gave Paulo Wanchope valuable support. Wanchope should have scored when Weah sent him clear of the Spurs defence, but lifted his shot wide of the far post. </p> <p>Weah's presence gave City a real lift and, sensing victory, began to break with purpose, Weah twice having firm shots saved by Sullivan. Rebrov managed to find the net in the 63rd minute but was ruled offside, had a long shot well saved by Weaver and then shot wastefully wide after a break from Ferdinand. </p> <p>The Ukranian had a cracking half-volley brilliantly saved by Weaver in the closing minutes, but the offside flag was raised anyway - it summed up the game.</p>",
  "<p>West Ham's first win of the season was every bit as convincing as the scoreline suggests. </p> <p>Despite an early injury blow, they tore gaping holes in a poor Coventry side whose lop-sided season continues. They have two victories and a Worthington Cup success on the road, but can do nothing right at home. </p> <p>West Ham's afternoon started badly, though. The last thing they needed in their present situation was to lose a key player 12 minutes into the match. Rio Ferdinand's challenge with Mustapha Hadji looked innocuous enough. But Ferdinand went off almost immediately, forcing a defensive reshuffle. </p> <p>Substitute Michael Carrick came into the midfield, with captain Steve Lomas dropping back to fill Ferdinand's position on the right side at the back. </p> <p>It was the only noteworthy incident in a dire first half hour which failed to produce a decent attack and which left both goalkeepers totally idle. </p> <p>But football has that capacity both to delight and despair the fans. Suddenly, Paulo Di Canio and Joe Cole began to work their magic and before Coventry knew it they were two goals down. </p> <p>It was a mistake by Richard Shaw which proved their undoing. He failed to get the ball away after a strong run by Frederic Kanoute and Di Canio needed no invitation to drive a firmly struck shot past Marcus Hedman. </p> <p>That came in the 37th minute and two minutes later Cole was celebrating his first goal of the season. </p> <p>Again the Coventry defence was left wanting as Di Canio's centre was allowed to reach a far-post position from where Cole drove it home through a crowd of players. </p> <p>The introduction of John Eustace for David Thompson, the way in which Craig Bellamy started running at defenders and, presumably, a half-time rollicking from Gordon Strachan brought Coventry to life. </p> <p>Eustace was denied from close range by Shaka Hislop and twice in quick succession Bellamy caused problems with his pace and close control. Each time excellent positional play by Stuart Pearce came to West Ham's rescue. </p> <p>Just when it seemed that Coventry might be getting a foothold back into the game, Kanoute's run and cross set up Frank Lampard for the decisive third goal.</p>",
  "<p>They came to bury Claudio Ranieri not to praise him but this new Roman in Britain left Old Trafford stunned as his team fought back bravely and departed into the afternoon sunshine with an unexpected but potentially morale-lifting point. Perhaps this Caesar is the one to put an end to the back-stabbing at Chelsea. </p> <p>There was certainly backbone this time to a flash, brash outfit often so slick at home to such as West Ham and so vulnerable at Bradford City. The renewed heart was personified by Graeme Le Saux, still feeling his way back after long-term injury and vilified in the defeat by Leicester City last Sunday but a diminutive colossus yesterday, leading by example after being made captain by Ranieri, 'because he's English'. </p> <p>It was one shrewd move by Ranieri. The other came at half time when he withdrew Jon Harley, promising but lightweight, and put Mario Melchiot in to stiffen a previously overrun midfield and to curtail the damage that the evergreen Teddy Sheringham was doing from his withdrawn striking position behind Andy Cole. We will let it pass that Sheringham's role has been well-known to the English game for the last five years. </p> <p>After the Leicester defeat Ranieri's first task, he said after yesterday's match, was 'to bring back confidence to a team which had gone through traumatic times and try to convince them they were a good enough team to get results'. The response seemed immediate, in Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's well-directed strike. </p> <p>For we of lesser faith, Scotland v Brazil in 1982 sprang to mind, the Scots making their first mistake in taking the lead similarly spectacularly to stir the Brazilians into a 4-1 win. Duly, for 30 minutes United were stung into their familiar industrious and flowing football, the ball transferred thrillingly at pace; control instant, finishing certain, Christian Panucci swamped by Ryan Giggs's runs. </p> <p>We thought the real United had stood up; the real Chelsea had lain down. In United's second goal was it especially evident. Coaches yell 'no bounce' at schoolboys when defending a high ball, so they will attack and clear it to avoid the panic the bouncing ball can create. Chelsea allowed David Beckham's chipped ball forward to bounce no fewer than three times before it was drilled home by Sheringham. It will have gone into Ranieri's jumbo-sized notebook. </p> <p>Raimond van der Gouw's error let in Tore Andre Flo's header, another triumph for Ranieri's tactics, Flo lining up wide on the right to exploit the weak link of Mikael Silvestre by cutting inside the full-back to meet a cross. Sir Alex Ferguson pinpointed it as the turning point, his dressing room subdued at the interval, the visitors' buoyant. Inside it, Ranieri told his team that he wanted to see 'the same spirit as Manchester United'. </p> <p>He got it - Gianfranco Zola even cleared from right back. </p> <p>Actually there was another turning point, Le Saux scooping Cole's shot athletically off the line. Within minutes he was at the byline at the other end to cross for Chelsea's equaliser, his third goal creation. It was significant that he went past David Beckham to do so. There can be no higher praise than that he eclipsed the man he was marking for most of the match. If we were surprised, Sir Alex wasn't. 'With their record against us and under a new coach, I thought they would be pumped up.' </p> <p>There are two flaws with United sometimes. Without Jaap Stam, their air of defensive invulnerability disappears. In addition, the Premiership can seem to easy to them. Boredom and complacency can seep in when they lead comfortably. Chelsea were fortunate on both counts yesterday. Reality should intrude. </p> <p>For all their heartening efforts, it remains only a point and they remain this year's 'big team in crisis' traditional at this time of the season. Ken Bates and his club will discover over the coming weeks the truth or otherwise of Shakespeare's other observation in Julius Caesar that 'the evil that men do lives after them'.</p>",
  "<p>Any Newcastle fans hoping Bobby Robson's Tyneside renaissance had transformed the Magpies from also-rans into genuine contenders saw the folly of their ways yesterday. Charlton, newly promoted and previously without an away win in eight matches, conquered what the locals have christened the stadium in the sky with an early Graham Stuart goal. </p> <p>Table-toppers just two weeks ago, Geordie ambitions are rapidly plummeting back to earth. </p> <p>'I'm not worried, I'm disappointed,' said Robson. 'We wasted 45 minutes of football before half-time and were poor in attitude and endeavour. I can't understand it.' </p> <p>'Wasted' was unfair on the visitors. Although, before this success, they had failed to win on their travels since March, Charlton have now gone six games at St James' without defeat. </p> <p>'It's turning into a bit of a jinx for them,' said their manager Alan Curbishley. 'The only disappointment for me was that we didn't come in further ahead at half-time.' </p> <p>They would have deserved as much. Stuart had already forced Shay Given to parry a long range drive before the visitors scored. Chris Powell fed John Robinson down the left and the Welshman cut inside before crossing to the area. Jonatan Johansson might have converted, but there was Stuart to nod past Given inside the six yard box with Newcastle's defence lost in a dithering mess. </p> <p>The advantage might have been doubled nine minutes later when Mark Kinsella crashed a volley against the bar after Claus Jensen's corner was only partially cleared. In response, all the Toon could muster were misplaced passes and a Nolberto Solano shot easily parried by Dean Kiely. </p> <p>With little sign of an improvement midway through the second half, Robson threw on a trio of substitutes, including the \u00a32.25 million teenager Lomama Tresor Lua Lua. The Zaire-born forward had never played in front of 10,000 let alone the 50,866 increasingly tense onlookers here, but twisted and turned to good effect. Almost immediately his quick feet took him around two back-pedalling defenders before the ball landed at Carl Cort's feet. The striker lashed it into the back of the net, only for United's celebrations to be cut short by a linesman's flag. </p> <p>'Lua Lua was a bit of a bright spot on a poor afternoon,' said Robson, who also lost the defender Alain Goma for 10 days with a broken nose. 'When we brought the three lads on we started to play and were camped in their half. We deserved at least a draw for that. It was the most disappointing performance I've had at St James' since I came to the club.' </p> <p>The late siege on the visitors' goal never came closer to yielding an equaliser than five minutes into stoppage time. Lua Lua crossed into the area and Alan Shearer, free at last from Richard Rufus's shackles, met the cross with a thumping header straight at Kiely. The Irish goalkeeper parried the attempt before gratefully clutching the rebound. </p> <p>Such fortune was no less than Rufus deserved for an outstanding display. The last time Charlton played here he was sent off; Two years later, and he looks a defender deserving of international recognition. Kevin Keegan take note. </p> <p>'Richard simply has to play like that if we are to win games like this,' said his manager. 'We had to dig deep in that last 20 minutes, but we kept Shearer under control, even when they were throwing everything at us in the last five minutes. </p> <p>'They made T-shirts last time we were top of the league and went down. They did it again earlier this season, but Sunderland managed to stay in the top six for a long time last season. Our club will be a lot stronger if we can emulate them.'</p>",
  "<p>Even those Celtic supporters whose expectations tend to be based on their team's exploits of 30 years ago will by now have come to realise that there will days in which their team will stagger, rather than swagger, over the finishing line. This was one of them, the Parkhead side causing themselves all manner of anxieties with a performance which rarely rose above mediocrity. </p> <p>But, if those same supporters are looking for portents with regard to the championship, they will be wallowing in the relatively unusual phenomenon of their side playing moderately and still winning. </p> <p>The kind of roll which has already yielded 11 straight victories would not normally be cited as a likely inducement to lethargy, but Celtic spent long periods of this curious match looking as though their previous endeavours should be enough to bring another three points as a matter of course. </p> <p>It is the type of soporific performance which makes a manager yearn for the half-time whistle, an opportunity to do some 'inducing' of his own. Martin O'Neill knows that, on days like these, there is a serious risk of falling behind and finding it impossible to summon the strength and application to take control of the game. </p> <p>That the home side did manage to escape to the dressing room scoreless was attributable entirely to their own crossbar, which Juan Sara rattled as early as the sixth minute. The Argentine striker had connected with a corner kick from his player-manager, Ivano Bonetti, on the right and, allowed a free header, bulleted it a couple of inches higher than ideal. </p> <p>It was an incident which occurred early enough to have stirred Celtic from their somnolent meanderings, but the Parkhead players seemed not to heed the warning. Instead, they persisted with a pedestrian, predictable style from which contrasted sharply with the slick passing and zestful running of earlier games this season. </p> <p>With Lubo Moravcik strangely out of touch during the first half, Celtic lacked inspiration in midfield, with most of the probing left to Jackie McNamara on the right and Alan Thompson on the left. In between, Stilian Petrov and Moravcik found it difficult to raise the tempo, while Paul Lambert played his usual deep role, mainly keeping out of those areas where damage might have been inflicted on the visitors. </p> <p>The result was a glaring scarcity of convertible supplies to Henrik Larsson and Chris Sutton in attack, a disservice their energetic commitment and willing running did not deserve. Indeed, the front pair created the best opportunity of that period between themselves. </p> <p>Sutton took a quick free-kick which released Larsson into the penalty area on the left, but, with only Robert Douglas to beat from 10 yards, the Swede uncharacteristically miscued his left-foot shot, scooping the ball just over the bar. Apart from a couple of half-hearted appeals for penalties and a drive from Thompson on the left - the ball pulled just wide of the far post - the home side produced little that was worthwhile. </p> <p>The home support had to wait until after the interval for that kind of treat, Sutton and Larsson providing the first hint of what was to come after only 11 minutes, when the big Englishman sent an awkward, bobbling low shot towards Douglas from outside the box. The goalkeeper, not entirely surprisingly, fumbled it back into space and Larsson just beat Lee Wilkie in the chase to push it back towards goal. Douglas managed to deflect the Swede's effort for a corner. </p> <p>Celtic's growing superiority was more subtle than breathtaking, but allowed their followers to anticipate their breakthrough. It was Thompson who did the construction work, carrying the ball through the inside left channel and delivering a perfect chip to Petrov on the six-yard line. The young Bulgarian, with calm precision, headed the ball down and over the line, leaving Douglas, at last, without hope. </p> <p>If Dundee were supposed to be deflated by the setback, it hardly showed; the visitors continuing with the composed, short passing game that had kept them out of trouble up to that point. The problem for the Dens Park side was that the bulk of the play by then was confined to areas from which they could not do much harm to Jonathan Gould. </p> <p>Even so, it was indicative of O'Neill's anxiety over his team's unconvincing play that, with seven minutes remaining, he should replace the creative Moravcik with central defender Alan Stubbs and move another defensive player, Johan Mjallby, into midfield. This was clearly a declaration of a what-we-have-we-hold policy, not the kind of approach Celtic supporters have become accustomed to seeing at their own ground.</p>",
  "<p>The Boro fans were clearing their collective throat ready for 'Robson Out!' chants when, in the 89th minute, Villa's Turkish defender Alpay Ozalan, under no particular pressure, turned a centre from Paul Ince into his own net. A stay of execution then for Bryan Robson but his team have still not won a League game at home this term. </p> <p>And they can count themselves lucky to have garnered this point. Throughout the first half, they plodded around without plan or purpose. Villa were sharper and more inventive with Ginola, Merson and Boateng showing such flashes of quality that were on offer in a generally mediocre game. </p> <p>Admittedly Boro looked better for a spell at the start of the second half and Boksic, the expensive striker, brought James into action for the first time in the game with a header that sent the Villa keeper diving across his goal line. So quiet had been James's first half that he came out early in the interval to get in some necessary practice. </p> <p>If Boro's goal was a gift from the gods then Villa's was hardly a contender for goal of the season. Dublin charged down a back pass. The ball cannoned off on-loan keeper Walsh back to Dublin and he slid it into the path of Julian Joachim, substituting for Ginola. Joachim may have improved his current popularity ratings by coolly shooting in to the corner of the net. </p> <p>Middlesbrough may lack a recognisable midfield but their greater deficiency is in defence. Villa's Ugo Ehiogu is reputedly the subject of a \u00a39 million bid by the Teessiders. Villa manager John Gregory hinted that it may not be enough - whatever, Ehiogu stayed firmly on the subs bench for this game. Boro could certainly benefit from his authority in a back line that Ginola turned with ridiculous ease at times. </p> <p>Villa's weakness was an inability to translate constructive football into goals. Against a side as ordinary as Boro they should have coasted home. </p> <p>John Gregory said: 'It was disappointing to be caught but the game should have been ours by then.' </p> <p>A relieved Robson said: 'In any club they expect you to do better at home than away. Up until last season we had an excellent record here.' </p> <p>That's all in the past Mr Robson. Ehiogu or not, you have a mountain to climb.</p>",
  "In politics - and, as I have discovered in the past fortnight, in the publishing of books - timing is everything. I wanted Servants of the People to show how New Labour really works from the inside. Like any author, naturally I hoped there would be an appetite for a contemporary account, revealing and rounded, of the relationships at the top of the Government and how they entangle with the making of policy. I was not going to be disappointed if people described the book as incendiary. What I never quite anticipated was that it would light the fires it has since The Observer began serialising the book. Nor could I know - I confess this was simple luck - that it would be published just at the moment when New Labour suffered its spectacular plunge from grace. <p>A question I've been repeatedly asked is: why? Why did so many people, at such senior levels, co-operate with the book? For one relatively straightforward reason, and another more complicated impulse. If an author is speaking to one party to an argument that has raged within Government, the other dimension wants its point of view reflected in the account as well, and the third angle doesn't want to be missed out either. Why were the sources so candid? </p> <p>It's probably true of all politicians, but it's especially true of New Labourites, that they tend to talk much more vividly and frankly in private than they do in public. It often struck me, as I conducted interviews, that if they could only translate some of their private emotion into their public performances, they might be more fondly regarded by the country. Indeed, a large part of the point of the book is to reveal the human face of New Labour beneath the suffocating mask of bland sound-biting. These are men and women consumed with high passions and tensions, loves and hates, fears and ambitions, which play out to both destructive and creative effect. </p> <p>Gathering information was often a simple case of knowing the right questions to put to the people who knew the answers. Journalism is a competitive, frequently cannibalistic profession. I've been both slightly surprised and greatly pleased that no serious commentator, of whatever political complexion, has challenged the veracity of my account. There was, as I anticipated, some ritual attempt at rebuttal from the Government about revelations that wounded them. </p> <p>So I offer one example of the care I took to be satisfied of the accuracy of what I was being told. It was from a member of the Cabinet that I first learnt that the Governor of the Bank of England had come so close to resignation that the Prime Minister had rung up Eddie George to bring him back from the brink. To hear this from a senior Minister in a position to know would be commonly regarded as sourcing enough for a newspaper story. For the book, I accumulated corroborating and amplifying testimony about the sequence of events from senior civil servants who were eye-witnesses and players in this episode. </p> <p>And once I had that, I secured conclusive confirmation of the story from the person absolutely best-placed to tell me that it was true that the Prime Minister had phoned the Governor. </p> <p>I believe there were profounder, some might even call them psychological, reasons for the depth and the candour with which people talked. The tiny and talented group, headed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, who created New Labour have never been as self-confident as they have sought to look. New Labour needs explaining to itself. </p> <p>This is a project in endless search of validation. One of the themes of the book is that the public swagger which has so often been labelled conceit and arrogance is actually the offspring of a deep insecurity about the nature of the project and its durability. </p> <p>In the early hours of 2 May, as the plane took him from Sedgefield to London to become Prime Minister, an apprehensive Tony Blair said to Cherie: 'But I've never been in government.' We tend to forget - and it is rather a tribute to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor that we neglect this - that none of the key players had ever been in government. The shock in Number 10 is not that they have tumbled in the opinion polls; the surprise is that it didn't happen much, much earlier. </p> <p>During the long, dream-like period of unprecedented popularity, Tony Blair and those around him were always anxiously awaiting the inevitable moment when the country would pinch them awake. </p> <p>After the multiple assault and battery on the Government, from the mounting debacles of the Millennium Dome to the fuel crisis, New Labour no longer looks to be in command of events. But the point is not that they have suddenly lost the magic touch. It is that those on the inside have never felt like magicians. The illusionists are best-placed to know what an illusion it was that New Labour was a glossily omnipotent machine always under the masterful control of an assured leader. </p> <p>That this illusion was maintained for so long was one of the great triumphs of Alastair Campbell's spin. </p> <p>There was a ready audience in a country that wanted its Government to be a success after the failures of the Major years. And successes, many of them, there have been. Newspaper headlines and serialisations inevitably provide only a flavour of a book. It is inevitable that they will concentrate on the warts, not the all. The Ecclestone Affair is probably the murkiest episode of New Labour's life, but it is only a chapter in the life of this Government, as it is only a chapter of the book. I thought - actually, I still think - that the revelation with the most broadly significant message about New Labour was that Tony Blair felt so wretched at his bleakest hour that he even despaired to one of his closest and most long-standing intimates: 'This is the end. They'll get me for this.' </p> <p>Was there ever a prospect that he would be forced to resign? No, I'd say none at all. That he feared that he might be ejected from office tells us how fragile New Labour felt its grip to be. Should Gordon Brown now resign? No. The Chancellor does not deserve to be turned into the fall-guy for Ecclestone - and, incidentally, my book doesn't make him so. I place chief responsibility for the affair with Number 10. Solidarity is not one of this Government's most conspicuous features. </p> <p>One of the striking things about the past week is how slowly his fellow Ministers rallied to the Chancellor when the pressure was at its peak. On Tuesday night, I found myself in the mildly surreal position of defending Gordon Brown on Newsnight, saying that if every politician in a panic who misled an interviewer was forced from office, we would not have many politicians left. </p> <p>I've been asking myself why this three-year-old affair blew up quite as incandescently as it did. After all, though I hoped to bring new detail to what happened, I thought it was already pretty well-established that New Labour was self-damagingly evasive about the affair. The answer, I suspect, is that much of the media and the Conservatives seized on an opportunity to revisit Ecclestone from a feeling that New Labour had got away too lightly at the time. The climate of goodwill towards the Government in its honeymoon period carried them through without all the awkward questions being properly asked at the time. Then they were taken on trust; now nothing is taken on trust. </p> <p>That honeymoon was the longest and most sustained for any British Government in history. Time after time, those in New Labour's high command have believed they were faced with meltdown. There were convulsing inner panics and recriminations when Peter Mandelson was defenestrated. The Kosovo conflict - during which Tony Blair performed with much greater courage than has hitherto been appreciated - might have cost him the premiership had it gone as horribly wrong as many in Downing Street feared it might. 'This is shit or bust', as he said. </p> <p>Yet he and the Government emerged from these crises not only intact, but often enhanced. For three years, the media wrote headline after headline describing New Labour's worst week and Blair's blackest day. For three years, the poll lead stretched on. And yet even this did not leave New Labour content. They fretted that the absence of a credible Opposition made things seem comfortable. The Government - this was the complaint among themselves - was not being given the credit due for its considerable achievements because of the absence of struggle. </p> <p>Incredible, but true, they worried that they were making government look too easy. So, this time last year, New Labour actually went out to make life more difficult for itself by conjuring up some enemies, the Forces of Conservatism which Tony Blair declared war upon in his Bournemouth conference speech. </p> <p>Twelve months on, you hear no-one inside New Labour worrying about a paucity of either struggles or enemies as the Government is besieged by aggrieved pensioners, petrol tax protesters and resurgent forces of conservatism. Conference revolt and Cabinet split - headlines which Tony Blair was supposed to have eradicated from association with Labour for eternity - shout from every newspaper. For the first time since Black Wednesday, the polls put the Tories ahead. </p> <p>The appearance of competence and responsiveness has been battered, and the reputation for disunity amplified by the alacrity with which Ministers have been scrambling to dump the blame for the Government's afflictions on each other. </p> <p>Given how hair-pulling they were being when New Labour was still way ahead in the polls, if Philip Gould is still writing memos about the focus groups to the Prime Minister, then they must make for very frightening reading. </p> <p>Tony Blair has turned into another unpopular Prime Minister. His mid-term has arrived later than usual; but come, as he always knew it would, it has. This is what history tells us happens to all governments, but for New Labour these are uncharted waters. A project that has so often believed success was synonymous with popularity is going to be fiercely tested if there is a period of sustained disaffection among the voters. </p> <p>There are many grounds for believing that the test can be passed. Beneath what the Prime Minister likes to call the passing frenzies, his Government can actually lay claim to some outstanding achievements, and displays fundamental strengths. The economy is healthy. Gordon Brown's war chest is almost embarrassingly bulging. The big tax and spend argument - so long as they are brave enough to make it - is there to be won against a stunt-addicted Conservative Party for whom opportunism always knocks. Investment in public services is growing while the tax burden remains one of the lowest in Europe. Few governments - perhaps no government - since the war have been so well-poised for re-election. </p> <p>It may even be that becoming unpopular had to happen to New Labour before it could realise its full potential as a government. Now, they will have to find a new tone of voice with which to talk to the country persuasively and firmly. </p> <p>They will have to summon up the courage to talk about their convictions. The Cabinet will have to become something more than a 45-minute coffee morning where the turbulent dual monarchy of Blair and Brown give other Ministers their message for the day. The party - this, at least, is the fervent hope inside Number 10 - will better appreciate its leaders' achievements now the Conservative threat is real. </p> <p>They will now pull together or be pulled to pieces. The resentments and rivalries that have too often disfigured relationships at the top of the Government are too bitterly entwined ever to be fully resolved. But the whole is bigger than the sum of the feuding parts. </p> <p>Tony Blair wants that second term, how he wants it. Gordon Brown wants to be his successor, how he wants it. Peter Mandelson wants to be Foreign Secretary, how he wants it. It may just be that this is the electric jolt they needed; the shock to the system that reminds them of the ambitions for themselves and for Britain that first made them allies and friends. </p> <p>New Labour's early narcotic period in power was deceiving about the Government. So too is the current climate of apocalypse. On May Day in 1997, Britain did not elect a communion of saints or a squad of supermen. In the autumn of 2000, we are not ruled by a pit of snakes or a bunch of idiots. They are flesh and blood. They have their heroic moments and their desperate ones. So New Labour suddenly looks mortal. Of course it does. It always was. </p>",
  "<p>At the end of a week in which his team virtually secured passage to the second group phase of the Champions League - a historic achievement that was denied them in cruel circumstances last season - the Rangers manager, Dick Advocaat, should have been trilling like a nightingale on speed. Instead, the little Dutchman was apprehensive, fretful and, like Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate, worried about his future. </p> <p>Advocaat dropped the broadest hint so far that he is unlikely to extend his contract with the Scottish champions beyond its expiry date in the summer of 2002, news that will practically nauseate supporters who regard him as the single most important figure in Rangers' resurgence since the league championship was lost to Celtic in 1998. </p> <p>Their reverence deepened last Wednesday night, when the 1-0 victory over Monaco in Monte Carlo took them into a clear lead in Group D, with six points from two matches, six goals scored and none conceded. With two of their remaining four games in the series at home - to Galatasaray and Monaco - the Ibrox side are long odds-on to reach stage two. </p> <p>Advocaat's anxiety derives from the pressures under which he has to strive not only to maintain Rangers' domination of the domestic game, but to improve their quality to a level at which they can compete as credible contenders in Europe's premier competition. </p> <p>He is also gravely concerned about the effects on clubs such as Rangers - and Celtic, for that matter - of the abolition of transfer fees, a development he fears will make life for Old Firm managers even more difficult than it is already. </p> <p>'The outside pressures I feel may have an influence when it comes time for me to make a decision over my contract in 2002,' said Advocaat, who, for a manager who rations his time with the media, can be extraordinarily candid. 'Money certainly won't come into it. </p> <p>'Of course, It's better to have money than not, but the most important thing is to be healthy. In any case, what's the difference when you talk about the kind of money we earn? Another \u00a310,000 a week wouldn't make that much difference, after tax and other deductions. No, that won't be a factor. </p> <p>'I've found the last eight months extremely demanding, much more than at any other time in my managerial career. People don't realise what you have to do to get new players in. You make calls, then you do it again and again and again. You have to spend so much energy on things which, to the outside world, look easy. </p> <p>'I coach as well, you know, but I don't feel I have the time to do different things in my job. There are so many outside pressures. But at least with Rangers, I have only to deal with our chairman, David Murray. When Wim Jansen was manager of Celtic, he used to tell me how he had to work with Fergus (McCann) and all the other people at Parkhead.' </p> <p>The possible onset of utter freedom of movement for players - without fees - seems to have convinced Advocaat that work which is already making serious demands of him could become intolerable. It is interesting that he should make reference to health being more important than money, suggesting that his manic involvement in every game - he is one of the most tempestuous and animated of managers - is becoming too taxing. </p> <p>'Whatever they may be saying about modifying the law to make football an exceptional case, something major is going to happen, there's no doubt about that,' he said. 'And it's going to make it even harder to get players in. </p> <p>'With Rangers - and Celtic, too - you always have to win. There is far more pressure on me in Scotland than there ever was in Holland. I would say that, without doubt, the pressure on the Old Firm in Scotland is the same as it is in places like Spain, Italy and England.' </p> <p>These are extraordinary admissions from a man who has seemed, since his arrival more than two years ago, to revel in the fray. From Advocaat's present concerns and his gloomy peek into the future, it is difficult not to infer that, by the end of next season, when he will be approaching 55, he will have had enough. </p> <p>None of this, of course, will interfere with his present ambition to take Rangers further in Europe, the next obstacle looming on Wednesday when Advocaat takes them to Istanbul for the confrontation with Galatasaray at the Ali Yami Sen Stadium. </p> <p>The notorious reputation established by this hostile venue is, in the opinion of the Rangers defender, Bert Konterman, entirely justified. The Dutchman has been there and gone through an experience he is unlikely to forget. Indeed, he almost stumbled over his words in his rush to recount it when asked about the time he played for Feyenoord against Galatasaray. </p> <p>'It was just a friendly during the winter shutdown, but there was still a full house,' said Konterman. 'And it is quite mad. It was bad enough that we should end the first half 2-0 down, but it became worse when we discovered at the interval that the dressing-room had been broken into. </p> <p>'I had a mobile phone stolen and other players had things like wedding rings taken. Mind you, it made us angry enough to go out and turn the 2-0 deficit into a 2-2 draw. It's a dangerous place all right, but we now have matters in our own hands. We have two home matches to come and winning them would make certain we go through.'</p>",
  "<p>In the United States July 4th means Independence Day. November 5th in Britain is Guy Fawkes Day. July 14th to a Parisian means the storming of the Bastille. For the people of Trinidad and Tobago, two events carry enough significance to be remembered by their dates alone. Trinidadians speak of 'July 27th' and 'November 19th' in hushed tones. Not even 'the 51', the West Indies cricket team's lowest Test score (against Australia in 1998) is accorded that respectful dread. </p> <p>On 27 July, 1990, the self-styled Imam Yasin Abu Bakr led 113 young black Muslims in an armed uprising that killed two dozen. The insurrectionists firebombed police headquarters, stormed the Parliament building and the only television station at the time, took the prime minister, members of Parliament and journalists hostage and precipitated a six-day crisis that paralysed the nation in a state of emergency and caused \u00a36 million of damage to public buildings and twice that to private property. </p> <p>And, on 19 November the year before, the national football team, needing only a home draw to qualify for the 1990 World Cup finals, were knocked out of the competition by the US by a single goal. In a dangerously overcrowded National Stadium, 30,000 calypso-singing, jumping, wildly cheering spectators clad in red were stunned into a silence from which they are only now emerging. Ten years later, it is difficult to say which event traumatised the nation more. </p> <p>Certainly Trinidad and Tobago foot ball seems to have recovered better than the nation itself. This year, scoring 13 goals and conceding none (and that without Shaka Hislop in the net), Trinidad and Tobago needed only four of their first six matches to qualify for the second round of the 2002 World Cup. Mexico, the leading team in the group on paper, have had the best performance against T &amp; T so far, going down by only 1-0. Canada lost by two at home and twice that many in Port of Spain; and, the day before the West Indies cricket team lost the Test series 3-1 to England at the Kennington Oval, Trinidad and Tobago's football team hit Panama for six at the Queen's Park Oval. </p> <p>Team spirit, under new coach Ian Porterfield, is so high that it is unlikely the now available Hislop will replace his substitute, Clayton Ince, in the next round, and perhaps not at all. Dwight Yorke left Aston Villa saying that, since he would probably never play in the World Cup for his country, he would have to consider Manchester United his personal summit. He looks likely to be eating his words in Japan. </p> <p>Yorke's rise is counterpoised by his friend (and former under-14 national football team colleague) Brian Lara's slow sinking from excellence under the overwhelming weight of a mediocre cricket team. Yorke is not a greater footballer than Lara is a cricketer; but fortune favours the lucky and the man who holds the two highest batting world records finds himself in a sport that is, at the moment, simply not as striking. </p> <p>The Queen's Park Oval was sold out for the games against Panama and Canada. Not even one-day cricket, with ticket prices half those of the football games, achieves that regularly any more. The one Test match played in Trinidad this year (against Zimbabwe, a game the West Indies very nearly lost) attracted crowds sparse enough to embarrass a secondary schools league final. </p> <p>In international prestige, which matters more than anything else to the West Indian, who scorns percolated Blue Mountain coffee for Nescafe instant, individual island football has whipped West Indies cricket. Jamaica captured the hearts of the world (if not a single point) when the Reggae Boyz got to the first round in France in 1998. The president of Concacaf (North and Central American Continental Football Federation), Austin 'Jack' Warner, is from Trinidad and even the most sceptical of his critics was impressed by seeing Kevin Keegan and Franz Beckenbauer each giving coaching sessions in Trinidad to try to win votes for his respective country's 2006 World Cup bid. </p> <p>The nation has not done as well, spiritually or materially, as the football team. The Muslim rebels were released from prison by a local judge and, by the time Trinidad and Tobago's highest court of appeal, the Privy Council, sitting at 11 Downing Street, eventually ruled that the rebels ought not to have been let go, they felt it would not be fair to re-arrest them. The law-abiding citizens of Trinidad and Tobago thus had to come to terms with watching the 114 men they saw shoot up the place on television get out of jail free. Two years ago, another local judge held that the Muslim rebels were entitled to compensation for a Muslim school and supermarket burned down by policemen out of vengeance. </p> <p>Politically, the ten years between 1990 and today have torn the nation's soul. The judiciary is in open conflict with a government led by a lifelong Marxist who now plays golf with the business elite he five years ago labelled 'the parasitic oligarchy'. The prime minister's heir apparent, the present attorney-general and the former president of the T &amp; T Human Rights Bureau, somehow squares his moral conviction against the death penalty with the direct personal supervision of the hanging of nine men in a single weekend. </p> <p>Apart from having a local girl named Miss Universe in 1998, Trinidad and Tobago has had little to celebrate in the last decade, particularly from West Indies cricket. The territory had only one player on the team last year and, when Brian Lara relinquished the captaincy, there was no Trinidadian at all. The economy is growing but so are the ranks of the poor, with nearly 40 per cent of the population living below the United Nations poverty line measured at the earning rate of one American dollar a day. Like everywhere else in the world, in Port of Spain, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting children. </p> <p>Hope of short-term glory lies with football, where the petty inter-island rivalry that devastates West Indies cricket is, somehow, not a factor. Trinidad and Tobago supported Jamaica in the last World Cup and, should only Trinidad and Tobago qualify this time around, Jamaicans are sure to cheer the Soca Boyz ahead of the teams West Indians generally support, Brazil and Argentina. </p> <p>Ten years ago, when qualification for the World Cup finals was more likely, and seven days before the last match itself, the government of the day threw a week-long celebration called Red Week without a hint of irony. </p> <p>Immediately before kick-off, the players were taken on a motorcade from one end of the island to the other and displayed to the adoring masses in an orchestrated demonstration of spontaneous appreciation that would have made Stalin jealous. The result of that premature frenzied festivity was 1-0 to the US, and the silence of the shell-shocked for a decade. </p> <p>Today, though they are quick to cheer each success of the World Cup team so far, Trinidadians and Tobagonians are slow to be talking about Japan 2002 the way they did about Italy 1990. There may be several red-letter days ahead but there will be no Red Week. </p> <p>The events of November 19th and July 27th are inextricably tied up in the minds and hearts of the people of Trinidad and Tobago; indeed, the national team were actually playing an international match when the Muslim rebels set off the first bombs of their coup attempt. Trinidadians may do well to remind themselves of the fates of the two teams that went out on the two dates: the Imam and his 113 of July 27 were freed; the eleven on the team of Red Week were left in tears on the field on November 19. And, just last week, with Dwight Yorke's future at Manchester United perhaps coming under a raised eyebrow, the Imam collected a cheque from the Attorney General for TT$1.5 million, the first instalment of the muslims' TT$12million claim for the damage done to their property.</p>",
  "<p>They said it couldn't be done, that the symbols of Wembley would fall apart if they were moved, that saving them was sport's mission impossible. Now it seems the Twin Towers may well be preserved after all - but by Rugby League in Cheshire, not football in north-west London. </p> <p>Wembley are close to an agreement with Halton Borough Council which would lead to the Twin Towers being moved, piece by piece, to become the centrepiece of the proposed new national rugby league museum in Widnes. If it comes off, the decidedly delicate operation will cost around \u00a33 million but Wembley will only see a measly \u00a32 of that. </p> <p>'We always said that if anybody was serious about giving the Twin Towers a good home, and could find a way round the huge logistical difficulties involved in moving them, we would give them to them', said Chris Palmer, Wembley's communications director. 'If this deal happens, we will sell the Towers for \u00a31 each.' </p> <p>Until now it had been thought that the old stadium's signature would crumble if anyone tried to move it, as the white towers are three-sided and have no back. Halton Council proposes to get round that by only removing the tops of the towers, which are four-sided, rather than the whole structures. They would then be broken down into chunks, moved gingerly up to a site beside the Runcorn Bridge and reassembled. </p> <p>Over the last year all sorts of ideas have surfaced to save the famous towers. Various reports had them going to the Nationwide Building Society's HQ in Swindon, joining a theme park in Skegness or becoming part of a Mohamed Al Fayed-funded new bridge over the Thames. Now they are '60-40 likely' to end up by the Mersey instead. It is the only practical preservation scheme that has been mooted. And if it fails, they will be reduced to a pile of rubble - just like the rest of the old place. </p> <p>Halton Council will have to move fast. The only events planned for Wembley after England v Germany on 7 October are a series of charity and paid-for games on the famous turf until 23 October. After that the pitch will be dug up and demolition of the stadium itself starts on 6 November at the tunnel end. </p> <p>The sale of seats and other memorabilia will raise \u00a32m towards the \u00a3600m costs of the new Wembley, while 30,000 lucky winners of charity auctions or raffles will each receive a one foot square piece of turf, courtesy of Securicor, in a pizza box-style commemorative container. Only the centre spot is being retained; it will be kept safe and replanted when the new turf is being laid. </p> <p>Demolition will involve two wrecking crews, each using a huge mechanical demolisher with jaws to 'bite' chunks out of Wembley until it is gone. </p> <p>Then, as the stands and old terracing disappears, the contractors will also dig down 30 metres to accommodate the foundations of the new stadium, which will be huge, dwarfing the familiar lines of its predecessor. </p> <p>When it is finished, fans will be stag gered by the scale of it. It will be twice as high as the Empire Stadium, and much wider. It will also boast an arch - its new motif and answer to the towers - which, at 135 metres tall, is almost 100m higher than the flags on top of those towers. It will be so huge that the enormous London Eye wheel on the South Bank could fit through it. 'The twin towers would look like pepperpots set in front of the arch. That gives you some idea of the different scale of the new building to the old', explains Palmer. </p> <p>Given Wembley's hilltop location, the arch will be visible from up to 20 miles away, especially when it is lit up, as it will be during an evening game. It will act as a beacon, or signpost, for fans converging on the new Wembley, such as those coming off the M1. One idea being toyed with is shooting a bolt of white light across it when England score, yellow for Brazil and so on. The arch will also serve a practical purpose: holding up the 7,000-tonne roof, rather like a suspension bridge. </p> <p>Although demolition will continue until March 2002, the new stadium will start rising behind the wrecking crews as soon as they have moved on. The new pitch should be laid in summer 2003. Unlike the turf in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, which slides in and out in strips, Wembley's will be permanent. Wembley National Stadium Limited, the Football Association-owned company behind the redevelopment, opted for a sliding roof, so that the grass can get as much direct sunlight as possible. </p> <p>WNSL say the new national stadium will have got rid of one of the many frustrations of the existing place: the shadow which covers a sizeable chunk of the pitch during the Cup Final - a major irritation, especially for television viewers. When Wembley reopens, only a small area around the corner flags should be in shade. </p> <p>Wembley's other fan-unfriendly drawbacks should also become ancient history. The new stadium will have 1,985 toilets instead of the existing 361. Those annoying half-time queues will be much shorter, so the need to relieve yourself behind one of the Portakabins should become much less urgent. There will be 478 catering outlets compared to the current 152. </p> <p>What about seats, another of the decrepit old stadium's disadvantages? There will be 90,000 - 12,000 more than at present - and fans are promised 30 per cent more 'personal space' in their seat. That should mean you can stretch your legs out in front of you and not have to tuck them under your backside. In theory, no more leg cramp. </p> <p>WNSL deny that the shiny new Wembley will be more for corporate customers than ordinary fans, but admit that only 76,400 of the 90,000 seats will be available to the latter. The others are divided up between corporate seats (4,000), club seats (6,000, sold as season tickets and likely to be hugely expensive), boxes (1,800), sponsors (1,000), VIPs (400) and the media (400). Expect a big row about all that. </p> <p>The hoped-for grand unveiling of the new Wembley with the 2003 Cup Final has now been abandoned. Instead Wembley will reopen with a schoolboy international in early 2004 to dry-run the facilities and then, hopefully, the 2004 Cup Final. </p> <p>denis.campbell@observer.co.uk</p>",
  "Serendipity is the most popular word in the English language, according to a poll conducted by the London Literary Festival. A term redolent of happy chance seems an odd choice for a nation with an anxiety complex the size of Cardiff, the flashpoint for the latest outbreak of mass hysteria. <p>On Tuesday, Warren Moore, drivetime presenter of the radio station, Red Dragon, made a facetious remark hinting at renewed petrol blockades. In normal times, his comment might have registered only with a Welsh hill farmer or two, a few, late-season pony-trekkers and a posse of longhorn sheep. Instead, countrywide queues built up, pumps ran dry, fuel replenishment was put back by a week and the Sun demanded: 'Have we all gone mad?' </p> <p>Apparently we have. As the phantom scare faded, more details emerged about the previous week's panic-buying. Somerfield, the high-street supermarket chain, reported that its customers did not restrict their shopping sprees to aisle wars over bread and milk. In addition, sales of deodorant, shampoo and shaving foam rose astronomically. Washing powder and cleaning fluids evaporated from the shelves as the public stockpiled against a pristine Armageddon. Had things got a micron more desperate, we would no doubt have been hoarding any mutant turnip left unsquelched by Lord Melchett and his newly-legitimised Greenpeace crop-tramplers. </p> <p>What to deduce from such irrational behaviour, beyond the fact that the bathroom cabinets of Middle Wallop are now stocked with sufficient anti-perspirant to sanitise every armpit in Mexico City? The social psychologists' explanation is simple. Collective behaviour is the glue of community and therefore a good thing until it is subverted by self-interest. Mass action of the me-first kind flourishes when people lack trust in central authority. Rumour and fear are sparked by lack of faith in official pronouncements. </p> <p>In an age of doubt and slick communication, the country prefers to take its cue from Wayne of Red Dragon rather than from a Prime Minister whose recent strategy on calming national panic seemed hardly more effective than that of a commuter shouting 'Sarin' on a Tokyo tube. But the drift in public faith is not primarily the fault of Blair, who, for all his vast majority, collected fewer votes in 1997 than Major did in 1992. Voter apathy means, in turn, that the parliamentary spectrum cannot reflect the wishes of the self-disenfranchised, who register their protest through other outlets. Hence what Steve Reicher, editor of the British Journal of Social Psychology, calls 'a crisis of democratic representation'. </p> <p>Or, as Martin Luther King put it: 'Crowds are the voice of the oppressed.' Mass movements, even with their overtones of panic and menace, are, at best, the engine of social change. The trouble is that the oppressed are a motley bunch with more or less righteous causes and justifiable tactics. From the Chartists to Seattle, the history of direct action is littered with the laudable and the loutish. All such crusades are cloaked in the one-size-fits-all mantle of worthy struggle and just ends. Group power of any sort teeters uneasily between the mild and the mad. </p> <p>So what provoked the most recent cocktail of protest and panic? Daniel Bell, the American sociologist and the father of the Third Way, would say that the deferred gratification of early capitalist production has yielded to instant fixes and grab-it-all hedonism. Whether panicking Persil-hoarders or Coutts-card fashion victims scouring the planet for the last pair of must-have Prada slingbacks, we are all mad consumers now. </p> <p>David Howell, in his new book, The Edge of Now, argues that current unrest will be stilled once we learn to love the global marketplace and rediscover the Victorian conflation of commerce and virtue. Perhaps so, but there never was a halcyon age of accord. The link between protest and the market has been going on since nineteenth-century food rioters discovered that an end to feudal structures equalled dearer grain. But in a modern democracy, the cult of direct action, only partly targeted on financial concerns, looks increasingly bizarre. Blankets of flowers for Diana, petrol bombs for the alleged paedophiles of the Paulsgrove estate, fox-hunters on the warpath, guerrilla gardeners trashing London: is this the normal cut-and-thrust of focus groups unleashed or a signal of something more sinister? </p> <p>Mob-mourning for Diana was always a leading indicator that the flood tide of British sentiment, if skewed to other ends, might turn nasty. The paedophile protest, conducted in the name of innocent children, proved just how vicious. </p> <p>Politicians, enjoined to 'listen', a synonym for 'cave in', have, at least until the petrol d\u00e9b\u00e2cle, riskily preferred emollience to condemnation when dealing with special interest groups. But stifling uproar can be a zero sum game, particularly when a febrile British public behaves as if, give or take a few screaming owls and crying crickets, we are all participants in the last act of Macbeth. </p> <p>Implicit in this mood is a justifiable suspicion that something odd is happening to democracy. When peaceful protesters against the Chinese President are bundled into police vans and anti-paedophile vigilantes are humoured, something is awry. When an unelected House Of Lords forces the retention of Section 28, its obduracy looks suspiciously like mob rule decked in ermine. And when Lord Melchett and 27 allies charged with criminal damage walk free from Norfolk Crown Court after admitting destroying a GM crop, it is truly time to reach for one's wallet. </p> <p>The verdict effectively means that hardliners, certain that the public cheers for them, will feel freer to wreak havoc with scientists' legitimate crop trials and besiege beleaguered farmers newly returned from manning the petrol barricades. This vicious circle of protest points up the power vacuum afflicting government. Although not responsible for the Melchett jury's call, politicians set the scene for clemency in failing to make the case that GM crops, potentially a vital future resource, should be properly tested. Instead, the debate became mired in charges of corporate exploitation and in a suspicion, undented so far, that the public, still understandably horrified by BSE, was being lined up for the vegetarian version. </p> <p>And so the crop protesters will be back. A neo-Luddite band emboldened now to consider themselves beyond the reach of the law, they are the latest ragtag army so easily conscripted in a post-industrial Britain where ideology falters and power belongs to any self-interest group with a mood-grabbing campaign and a wish to bend the Government to its will. The clout once applied by state or unions is mutating into what E.P. Thompson called 'collective bargaining by riot'. Public uprisings do occasionally pitch it right, as in the outcry for more money for the health service, but in the main, they specialise in the selfish, the blinkered and the vindictive. </p> <p>None of that might matter, except for the dangerous gulf between the brilliance of the strategy of internet-age direct action and the vacuity of its aims. The recent overall gain of twentieth-century protest, and its sideline of panic, is as follows: a stream of sex offenders driven underground, a freer hand to block legitimate scientific progress and a stash of superfluous shower gel. </p> <p>Such a tally might have puzzled those, from Luther King to Pankhurst, who made direct action the accelerator of social progress. Today, it seems more like its drag anchor. That is why Tony Blair's toughness towards petrol protesters is right. And why William Hague's moment of bonding with the 'fine, upstanding' citizens of the picket line will prove to be less than serendipitous.</p>",
  "<p>South African police have stepped up security outside Kruger National Park following the recent hijacking and robbery of two tourists, writes Joanne O'Connor. </p> <p>An extra 50 police officers have been employed to patrol main roads leading to South Africa's most famous game reserve following an incident earlier this month, when a couple from New York and their tour guide were forced off the road by a van carrying eight men and robbed at gunpoint of their possessions and vehicle. </p> <p>The robbery took place about four kilometres from the gate of the Sabi Sand, a private game reserve adjacent to Kruger National Park. No tourists have been attacked inside the park - which attracts more than 1 million visitors a year - but there have been at least four robberies so far this year on roads outside. </p> <p>Kruger's own team of security officers is working closely with police to address the problem. Seven arrests have been made in connection with the most recent incident, which took place on 8 September. </p> <p>David Mabunda, director of Kruger National Park, said: 'The situation is under control and we want to avoid an alarmist approach. We advise visitors to avoid taking short cuts and stick to the main roads, and to exercise the same caution they would use if they were travelling around any European city.' </p> <p>Sheena Noakes, product manager for South African Airways Holidays, said clients embarking on fly-drive itineraries were advised to lock their car doors, avoid travelling at night and stick to the main roads. She added: 'We have never had any problems with clients driving in South Africa. I have driven through the park on my own and never felt unsafe.' </p> <p><strong>Official: Britons immune to holiday love bug </strong></p> <p>The British are more interested in eating lunch than making love when on holiday, writes Desmond Balmer . A NOP poll found that while 91 per cent of those surveyed wanted to find good food while on holiday, just 29 per cent were searching for romance. </p> <p>The poll, conducted for Yell.com, the Yellow Pages website, also showed that holidaymakers were three times more likely to be bitten by a nasty bug than to fall in love. While 84 per cent found new friends on holiday (balanced by the 82 per cent who found irritating people), 70 per cent were bitten by insects and just 22 per cent found romance.</p> <p>There was a racier result to the question about what people lost on holiday. Almost a quarter said they lost their inhibitions, 22 per cent lost their clothes and 18 per cent lost the way home (men were twice as likely to forget where they were staying).</p>",
  "<p>Even its most dedicated fans - the people who spent last week moping, experiencing a humiliating bereavement after its pyrotechnic climax just nine days ago - will admit that Big Brother was extremely short on mystery. Here was co-ed prison life laid bare for the 24/7 CCTV generation. We saw everything, from the is-this-really-happening? (Nick's machinations, poor Thomas's erection, Caggie's Dark Night of the Soul) to the relentlessly banal (the long hours of fag-rolling, spot-popping and the apparent freeze-frame of bodies lying motionless on the lawn). And, all the time, we listened: to chats about brothels and chickens and George Michael and spiders. As the weeks ground on, the survivors realised how little they had in common, and sensible conversation dried up entirely. When we got into the final lap, those hypnotically dull dog days just before the winner was announced, it seemed that neither Anna, Craig nor Darren could think of anything more interesting to say apart from, 'Anyone for a cup of tea?' The strangest thing was that no one ever asked the most obvious question: Anna, what on earth are you doing in here? </p> <p>Anna Nolan, 'the little Irish lezzie', as Caggie affectionately called her, was different. She may have had a stint as a prison warder, an international basketball player and, most famously, a nun, but she also seemed the most normal person in a very abnormal situation. Of all the housemates, she was the one who gave least away while still managing to participate fully in the life of the house. Some people read this as malevolence. Early on, the Times 's Matthew Parris identified her as a deeply sinister presence; Nasty Nick memorably said that she was 'calculating' and 'deadly as a snake'. But the people who hoped she would walk off with the \u00a370,000 (which, by the end, she desperately wanted, to spend on a deposit for a flat) liked her because she appeared to be the only contestant who was properly equipped for life outside the house. She wasn't a show-off, like Andy, Nichola and Caggie; nor an innocent like Thomas and Darren; nor insecure like Mel and Nick; nor cardboard cutouts like Sada, Craig and Claire. No: she cracked good jokes, she exerted a calming influence on the group, and she never lost it. </p> <p>You'd want Anna on your team every time, precisely because you could rely on her not to release a trashy rave single, or do a stint as a panto villain, or become a brassiere model. Forget her canonisation as a gay icon: her appeal went much wider than that. Anna's sexuality did not define her role on what was ultimately a soap: that alone makes her a unique figure in TV history. Perhaps her greatest achievement was to play Big Brother at his own game: she joined in without selling out, or selling her soul, and she made it to the wire. </p> <p>Naturally, I voted for her (along with 3.41 million others). We saw her come second to Craig, whose 'Heart For Jo' moment provided a startlingly graceful conclusion to the whole circus; we saw her leave the house, looking uncharacteristically dazed in her characteristic get up of jeans and sneakers; and we still never got the answer to that question. Why did you do it, Anna? </p> <p>Anna, who's a month short of her thirtieth birthday, keeps her head down as she follows her recently-acquired PR person into a brasserie in Camden. Yes, she's boyish and skinny, in a long-sleeved T-shirt and jeans and Birkenstocks, just as you would have expected, but there is something different about her. Of course! She's brushed her hair! (Watching the tapes as far as week five, that was the thing that really shocked her. 'It was like two chickens at the back of my head.' She had packed a hairbrush, she says, but forgot about it until the last day.) </p> <p>She orders a gin and tonic - not bad for 2.10pm - and deftly attaches the mike of my dictaphone to her collar, though I get the impression she's a little bit nervous. Explaining why she wanted to go on the show, she says, 'I got carried away, swept along.' She'd seen the documentary about the Dutch version of Big Brother and was intrigued, so applied rather absent-mindedly. Things snowballed from there. When she got the final nod, she remembers thinking: 'Oh, I haven't even decided if I really want to do it yet.' Her long-term girlfriend, Tanya Paice, thought it was a terrible idea; so did her friends and family. 'People said, \"You've only been chosen because you're a lesbian ex-nun. Channel 4 are just going to milk that.\" And I thought, very good point.' So why did she go against everyone's advice? </p> <p>'It's so appealing, being on television 24 hours a day,' sighs Anna, with dashing irony. 'People say it was sick, it was like an attraction to something perverse, and maybe that's why I did it. But at the end of the day, the reasons why people were saying not to do it - you're a lesbian and that means you might get some bad press - didn't seem to me to be reasons to pull out. I thought I should just be a bit ballsy about it.' In other words, as a self-confident sort of person, she didn't see why her sexuality should inhibit her from having a pop at the prize. </p> <p>Anna grew up in a working-class suburb of Dublin, one of seven siblings. Her dad, Kevin, was a labourer at Guinness; her mother Eileen left school at 14, but has recently taken a degree in classical Greek, and is now studying for an MA. According to their daughter, Mr and Mrs Nolan were described in the press as 'devout Catholic parents of Anna Nolan, the lesbian ex-nun who said she'd bring a vibrator into the house.' Anna imitates her mother's reaction: 'I was disgusted! Devout Irish Catholic - how dare they!' </p> <p>While the Nolan children were growing up, every spare penny went towards their education; all the girls went to a fee-paying convent and had private music instruction. Anna did a degree in music and musical instrument technology at London Guildhall, and then drifted into a series of slackery jobs. Most recently, she was working at a skateboard shop. Eileen, a woman who has evidently got stacks of focus and ambition, is Anna's heroine. One gets the impression that the job offers that are coming her daughter's way - maybe a slot on a London radio station; maybe a presenting role on TV documentaries - may provide a longed-for chance to shift gear, professionally. </p> <p>'In the house, we talked about the link that we all had,' says Anna, taking a slug of G&amp;T, 'and it emerged that everyone wanted to change their life somehow. Because if you're basically content and happy with your job, your life, your family, you probably didn't want to go on this show. What's the point? So we were 11 people who just wanted to give ourselves a right old kick up the arse and then see what would happen. It was inspiring.' </p> <p>Not all the time, of course. Ask Anna for her abiding memory of the house, and she says, instantly, 'Waiting. Waiting for the shopping, for nominations. I was tense 70 per cent of the time. It was so hard not being in control.' All the bedroom lights were switched on, with a percussive ker-chung, at 10 every morning. Hot water was only available at a certain time; access to the store room was rigorously controlled. To viewers, Anna was the contestant who seemed to perk up most in the diary room, sensing the challenge of trying to crack Big Brother's cast-iron inscrutability. 'I had a fixation with him, yeah. When Nick left, we were all gutted - and then Big Brother gave us a video, a bar of chocolate, and we were like, \"Hey, Nick who?\" We were so fickle.' </p> <p>On Day One, she says, she was utterly intimidated. Who by? 'Darren, Sada, Nichola, Caroline. You could see their personality on the outside. And Mel, because Mel was so...' and here Anna again airs her formidable talent for impersonation, pouting and looking flirtily sideways... 'so cool.' Then she checks herself, conscious that this might be misinterpreted. She has seen Mel earlier today; later she will say that Mel and Darren are the only contestants with whom she imagines she'll stay in touch. 'I love Mel,' she says. 'All her bad press is rubbish. I feel Mel was unfairly represented.' But for more than half of the incarceration, Mel gave the impression of wanting to hang out exclusively with the men, where she was always guaranteed lots of attention, rather than attempting to make female friends. 'Early on,' says Anna, stoutly, 'Mel did pick up that there was a lot of animosity towards her from the girls' camp. Stupidly created by some girls, jealous minxes. No, I'm not telling.' </p> <p>We didn't see that on screen; Channel 4 was clearly shaping the narrative. But much of the time, the housemates (who were always aware of the tread of the technical staff behind the walls, and conscious of the electronic whine of the CCTVs) were also controlling what was broadcast. Underneath the braggadocio - the shaggy dogs involving Thai massage parlours and threesomes - few candidates talked openly and with sincerity about their love lives. Most housemates benefited from this, as the public, who picked the evictee every week, was definitely swayed by a rather nasty sort of emotional terrorism: a vengeful, rather puritanical longing to stamp on any sexual tension that threatened to flourish. (What does it say about us as a nation that we were so keen to punish Andy and Thomas for falling for Mel?) </p> <p>As far as viewers were aware, then, Anna was gay but single. The appearance of Tanya - pretty, blonde, and kind of clingy - on the final night put paid to that notion. The pair had decided in advance that it would be better if Tanya's name wasn't mentioned. Later on, Tanya had a change of heart, but by then it was too late. Hence the showy reunion. </p> <p>But it suited Anna to hold back a little. Before she went into the house, she had read an article about Bart, the winner of the Dutch competition. 'He said, even though you're exposed completely 24 hours a day, you have your privacy, and you can choose what you speak about. I loved that the cameras couldn't get me - I was just protecting myself. In the future, when people say, \"Oh, I know you,\" I'll say, \"You do, but you only know part of me.\" There's a little bit that my family and friends know that's different. And that's such a nice feeling to have. So yes, I was just evasive when people talked about relationships. But a lot of people were.' Anna believes that Mel and Tom were doing the same sort of thing. Perhaps strategies were firmed up in the first fortnight, when Sada bored everyone to tears with tales of her boyfriend. 'We were in this little cocoon, so to speak constantly about your partner meant that we got a bit pissed off, a little bit agitated.' </p> <p>Then there was Nick. 'He fooled us all,' sighs Anna, without a trace of indulgence, 'and he fooled the nation so much more because everyone's intrigued and adores him. I'm just like, \"Nick, you just need help.\" I was so dim, I just didn't see it.' Maybe she didn't see it because he never showed her his little pieces of paper. I wonder whether she felt the people who did read his notes but failed to blow the whistle were just as culpable. 'Yes. We had a lot of arguments after that. People were saying, why didn't Mel and Tom shout about it? And Craig: Craig's brought it up now that he's been nominated, but why didn't he bring it up before?\" </p> <p>We know that Anna found Craig irritating: she nominated him constantly. But now it's all over, she is gracious without being saccharine. 'He was the right winner. He was perfect. He wanted it the most, it's what the public wanted the most. When he came out and he gave that money to Jo, I was in tears. He was a star. It was the best finale.' But in the end, she lost, didn't she? 'Yes,' says Anna, shuffling her Birkenstocks under the table. 'Craig was a success with the public, and that's absolutely fine with me. But the reason why I'm pleased I stayed till the last week was that it means I was a success in the house. I knew Craig would win, from the first week. Yeah, I was a little disappointed, but then I was thinking: what's this programme all about? Has the most interesting person won? Has the most intelligent person won? Do I want mass popularity? No, I only want the people who I think I would like to like me.' </p> <p>\u0095 Donations to the Heart for Jo Appeal can be made to the Royal Bank of Scotland, sort code 16 33 17, account number 10009836.

  "<p>When we're at our summer house in western Maine, I walk four miles every day, unless it's pouring down with rain. Three miles of this walk are on dirt roads which wind through the woods; a mile of it is on Route 5, a two-lane blacktop highway which runs between Bethel and Fryeburg.</p> <p>The third week in June of 1999 was an extraordinarily happy one for my wife and me; our kids, now grown and scattered across the country, were all home. It was the first time in nearly six months that we'd all been under the same roof. As an extra bonus, our first grandchild was in the house, three months old and happily jerking at a helium balloon tied to his foot.</p> <p>On 19 June, I drove our younger son to the Portland Jetport, where he caught a flight back to New York City. I drove home, had a brief nap, and then set out on my usual walk. We were planning to go en famille to see The General's Daughter in nearby North Conway, New Hampshire that evening, and I thought I just had time to get my walk in before packing everybody up for the trip.</p> <p>I set out on that walk around four o'clock in the afternoon, as well as I can remember. Just before reaching the main road (in western Maine, any road with a white line running down the middle of it is a main road), I stepped into the woods and urinated. It was two months before I was able to take another leak standing up.</p> <p>When I reached the highway I turned north, walking on the gravel shoulder, against traffic. One car passed me, also headed north. About three-quarters of a mile farther along, the woman driving the car observed a light-blue Dodge van heading south. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other, barely under the driver's control. The woman in the car turned to her passenger when they were safely past the wandering van and said, 'That was Stephen King walking back there. I sure hope that guy in the van doesn't hit him.'</p> <p>Most of the sightlines along the mile of Route 5 which I walk are good, but there is one stretch, a short, steep hill, where a pedestrian walking north can see very little of what might be coming his way. I was three-quarters of the way up this hill when Bryan Smith, the owner and operator of the light-blue Dodge van, came over the crest.</p> <p>He wasn't on the road; he was on the shoulder. My shoulder. I had perhaps three-quarters of a second to register this. It was just time enough to think, My God, I'm going to be hit by a school bus . I started to turn to my left. There is a break in my memory here. On the other side of it, I'm on the ground, looking at the back of the van, which is now pulled off the road and tilted to one side.</p> <p>This recollection is very clear and sharp, more like a snapshot than a memory. There is dust around the van's tail-lights. The licence plate and the back windows are dirty. I register these things with no thought that I have been in an accident, or of anything else. It's a snapshot, that's all. I'm not thinking; my head has been swopped clean.</p> <p>There's another little break in my memory here, and then I am very carefully wiping palmfuls of blood out of my eyes with my left hand. When my eyes are reasonably clear, I look around and see a man sitting on a nearby rock. He has a cane drawn across his lap. This is Bryan Smith, 42 years of age, the man who hit me with his van. Smith has got quite a driving record; he has racked up nearly a dozen vehicle-related offences.</p> <p>Smith wasn't looking at the road on the afternoon our lives came together, because his Rottweiler had jumped from the very rear of his van into the back-seat area, where there was an Igloo cooler with some meat stored inside. The Rottweiler's name is Bullet (Smith has another Rottweiler at home; that one is named Pistol). Bullet started to nose at the lid of the cooler. Smith turned around and tried to push Bullet away. He was still looking at Bullet and pushing his head away from the cooler when he came over the top of the knoll; still looking and pushing when he struck me.</p> <p>Smith told friends later that he thought he'd hit 'a small deer' until he noticed my bloody spectacles lying on the front seat of his van. They were knocked from my face when I tried to get out of Smith's way. The frames were bent and twisted, but the lenses were unbroken. They are the lenses I'm wearing now, as I write this.</p> <p>Smith sees I'm awake and tells me help is on the way. He speaks calmly, even cheerily. His look, as he sits on his rock with his cane drawn across his lap, is one of pleasant commiseration: Ain't the two of us just had the shittiest luck? it says. He and Bullet left the campground where they were staying, he later tells an investigator, because he wanted 'some of those Marzes-bars they have up to the store'. When I hear this little detail some weeks later, it occurs to me that I have nearly been killed by a character right out of one of my own novels. It's almost funny.</p> <p> Help is on the way, I think, and that's probably good because I've been in a hell of an accident. I'm lying in the ditch and there's blood all over my face and my right leg hurts. I look down and see something I don't like: my lap now appears to be on sideways, as if my whole lower body had been wrenched half a turn to the right. I look back up at the man with the cane and say, 'Please tell me it's just dislocated.'</p> <p>'Nah,' he says. Like his face, his voice is cheery, only mildly interested. He could be watching all this on TV while he noshes on one of those Marzes-bars. 'It's broken in five I'd say maybe six places.' 'I'm sorry,' I tell him - God knows why - and then I'm gone again for a little while. It isn't like blacking out; it's more as if the film of memory has been spliced here and there.</p> <p>When I come back this time, an orange-and-white van is idling at the side of the road with its flashers going. An emergency medical technician - Paul Fillebrown is his name - is kneeling beside me. He's doing something. Cutting off my jeans, I think, although that might have come later.</p> <p>I ask him if I can have a cigarette. He laughs and says not hardly. I ask him if I'm going to die. He tells me no, I'm not going to die, but I need to go to the hospital, and fast. I ask Fillebrown again if I'm going to die, and he tells me again that I'm not. Then he asks me if I can wiggle the toes on my right foot. 'My toes, did they move?' I ask Paul Fillebrown. He says they did, a good healthy wiggle. 'Do you swear to God?' I ask him, and I think he does. I'm starting to pass out again. Fillebrown asks me, very slowly and loudly, bending down into my face, if my wife is at the big house on the lake. I can't remember. I can't remember where any of my family is, but I'm able to give him the telephone numbers of both our big house and the cottage on the far side of the lake where my daughter sometimes stays. Hell, I could give him my Social Security number, if he asked. I've got all my numbers. It's just everything else that's gone.</p> <p>Other people are arriving now. Somewhere a radio is crackling out police calls. I'm put on a stretcher. It hurts, and I scream. I'm lifted into the back of the EMT truck, and the police calls are closer. The doors shut and someone up front says, 'You want to really hammer it.' Then we're rolling.</p> <p>Paul Fillebrown sits down beside me. He has a pair of clippers and tells me he's going to have to cut the ring off the third finger of my right hand - it's a wedding ring Tabby gave me in 1983, 12 years after we were actually married. I try to tell Fillebrown that I wear it on my right hand because the real wedding ring is still on the third finger of my left - the original two-ring set cost me $15.95 at Day's Jewelers in Bangor. That first ring only cost eight bucks, in other words, but it seems to have worked.</p> <p>Some garbled version of this comes out, probably nothing Paul Fillebrown can actually understand, but he keeps nodding and smiling as he cuts that second, more expensive, wedding ring off my swollen right hand. Two months or so later, I call Fillebrown to thank him; by then I understand that he probably saved my life by administering the correct on-scene medical aid and then getting me to the hospital at a speed of roughly 110mph, over patched and bumpy back roads.</p> <p>Fillebrown assures me that I'm more than welcome, then suggests that perhaps someone was watching out for me. 'I've been doing this for 20 years,' he tells me over the phone, 'and when I saw the way you were lying in the ditch, plus the extent of the impact injuries, I didn't think you'd make it to the hospital. You're a lucky camper to still be with the program.'</p> <p>The extent of the impact injuries is such that the doctors at Northern Cumberland Hospital decide they cannot treat me there; someone summons a LifeFlight helicopter to take me to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. At this point my wife, older son, and daughter arrive. The kids are allowed a brief visit; my wife is allowed to stay longer. The doctors have assured her that I'm banged up, but I'll make it.</p> <p>The lower half of my body has been covered. She isn't allowed to look at the interesting way my lap has shifted around to the right, but she is allowed to wash the blood off my face and pick some of the glass out of my hair. There's a long gash in my scalp, the result of my collision with Bryan Smith's windshield. This impact came at a point less than two inches from the steel, driver's-side support post. Had I struck that, I likely would have been killed or rendered permanently comatose, a vegetable with legs. Had I struck the rocks jutting out of the ground beyond the shoulder of Route 5, I likely also would have been killed or permanently paralysed. I didn't hit them; I was thrown over the van and 14ft in the air, but landed just shy of the rocks.</p> <p>'You must have pivoted to the left just a little at the last second,' Dr David Brown tells me later. 'If you hadn't, we wouldn't be having this conversation.'</p> <p>The LifeFlight helicopter lands in the parking lot of Northern Cumberland Hospital, and I am wheeled out to it. The sky is very bright, very blue. The clatter of the helicopter's rotors is very loud. Someone shouts into my ear, 'Ever been in a helicopter before, Stephen?' The speaker sounds jolly, all excited for me. I try to answer yes, I've been in a helicopter before - twice, in fact - but I can't. All at once, it's very tough to breathe.</p> <p>They load me into the helicopter. I can see one brilliant wedge of blue sky as we lift off; not a cloud in it. Beautiful. There are more radio voices. This is my afternoon for hearing voices, it seems. Meanwhile, it's getting even harder to breathe. I gesture at someone, or try to, and a face bends upside down into my field of vision.</p> <p>'Feel like I'm drowning,' I whisper.</p> <p>Somebody checks something, and someone else says, 'His lung has collapsed.'</p> <p>There's a rattle of paper as something is unwrapped, and then the someone else speaks into my ear, loudly so as to be heard over the rotors. 'We're going to put a chest tube in you, Stephen. You'll feel some pain, a little pinch. Hold on.'</p> <p>It's like being thumped very high up on the right side of the chest by someone holding a short sharp object. Then there's an alarming whistle in my chest, as if I've sprung a leak. In fact, I suppose I have. A moment later, the soft in-out of normal respiration, which I've listened to my whole life (mostly without being aware of it, thank God), has been replaced by an unpleasant shloop-shloop-shloop sound. The air I'm taking in is very cold, but it's air, at least, air, and I keep breathing it. I don't want to die. I love my wife, my kids, my afternoon walks by the lake. I also love to write. I don't want to die, and as I lie in the helicopter looking out at the bright blue summer sky, I realise that I am actually lying in death's doorway. Someone is going to pull me one way or the other pretty soon; it's mostly out of my hands. All I can do is lie there, look at the sky, and listen to my thin, leaky breathing: shloop-shloop-shloop.</p> <p>Ten minutes later, we set down on the concrete landing pad at CMMC. To me, it seems to be at the bottom of a concrete well. The blue sky is blotted out and the whap-whap-whap of the helicopter rotors becomes magnified and echoey, like the clapping of giant hands.</p> <p>Still breathing in great leaky gulps, I am lifted out of the helicopter. Someone bumps the stretcher and I scream. 'Sorry, sorry, you're okay, Stephen,' someone says - when you're badly hurt, everyone calls you by your first name, everyone is your pal.</p> <p>'Tell Tabby I love her very much,' I say as I am first lifted and then wheeled, very fast, down some sort of descending concrete walkway. All at once I feel like crying.</p> <p>'You can tell her that yourself,' the someone says. We go through a door; there is air-conditioning and lights flowing past overhead. Speakers issue pages. It occurs to me, in a muddled sort of way, that an hour before I was taking a walk and planning to pick some berries in a field that overlooks Lake Kezar. I wouldn't pick for long, though; I'd have to be home by 5.30 because we were all going to the movies. The General's Daughter , starring John Travolta. Travolta was in the movie made out of Carrie , my first novel. He played the bad guy. That was a long time ago.</p> <p> 'When?' I ask. 'When can I tell her?'</p> <p>'Soon,' the voice says, and then I pass out again. This time it's no splice but a great big whack taken out of the memory-film; there are a few flashes, confused glimpses of faces and operating rooms and looming X-ray machinery; there are delusions and hallucinations fed by the morphine and Dilaudid being dripped into me; there are echoing voices and hands that reach down to paint my dry lips with swabs that taste of peppermint. Mostly, though, there is darkness.</p> <p>Bryan Smith's estimate of my injuries turned out to be conservative. My lower leg was broken in at least nine places - the orthopaedic surgeon who put me together again, the formidable David Brown, said that the region below my right knee had been reduced to 'so many marbles in a sock.'</p> <p>The extent of those lower-leg injuries necessitated two deep incisions - they're called medial and lateral fasciatomies - to release the pressure caused by the exploded tibia and also to allow blood to flow back into the lower leg. Without the fasciatomies (or if the fasciatomies had been delayed), it probably would have been necessary to amputate the leg. My right knee itself was split almost directly down the middle; the technical term for the injury is 'comminuted intra-articular tibial fracture'. I also suffered an acetabular cup fracture of the right hip - a serious derailment, in other words - and an open femoral intertrochanteric fracture in the same area. My spine was chipped in eight places. Four ribs were broken. My right collarbone held, but the flesh above it was stripped raw. The laceration in my scalp took 20 or 30 stitches. Yeah, on the whole, I'd say Bryan Smith was a tad conservative.</p> <p>Mr Smith's driving behaviour in this case was eventually examined by a grand jury, who indicted him on two counts: driving to endanger (pretty serious) and aggravated assault (very serious, the kind of thing that means jail time). After due consideration, the District Attorney responsible for prosecuting such cases in my little corner of the world allowed Smith to plead out to the lesser charge of driving to endanger. He received six months of county jail time (sentence suspended) and a year's suspension of his privilege to drive. He was also put on probation for a year with restrictions on other motor vehicles, such as snowmobiles and ATVs. It is conceivable that Bryan Smith could be legally back on the road in the fall or winter of 2001.</p> <p>David Brown put my leg back together in five marathon surgical procedures that left me thin, weak and nearly at the end of my endurance. They also left me with at least a fighting chance to walk again. A large steel and carbon-fibre apparatus called an external fixator was clamped to my leg. Eight large steel pegs called Schanz pins run through the fixator and into the bones above and below my knee. Five smaller steel rods radiate out from the knee. These look sort of like a child's drawing of sunrays. The knee itself was locked in place. I entered the hospital on 19 June. Around the 25th, I got up for the first time, staggering three steps to a commode, where I sat with my hospital johnny in my lap and my head down, trying not to weep and failing. You try to tell yourself that you've been lucky, most incredibly lucky, and usually that works because it's true. Sometimes it doesn't work, that's all. Then you cry.</p> <p>A day or two after those initial steps, I started physical therapy. During my first session, I managed 10 steps in a downstairs corridor, lurching along with the help of a walker. One other patient was learning to walk again at the same time, a wispy 80-year-old woman named Alice who was recovering from a stroke. We cheered each other on when we had enough breath to do so. On our third day in the downstairs hall, I told Alice that her slip was showing.</p> <p>'Your ass is showing, sonnyboy,' she wheezed, and kept going.</p> <p>I came home to Bangor on 9 July, after a hospital stay of three weeks. I began a daily rehab program which includes stretching, bending, and crutch-walking. I tried to keep my courage and my spirits up. On 4 August, I went back to CMMC for another operation. When I woke up this time, the Schanz pins in my upper thigh were gone. I could bend my knee again. Dr Brown pronounced my recovery 'on course' and sent me home for more rehab and physical therapy. And in the midst of all this, something else happened. On 24 July, five weeks after Bryan Smith hit me with his Dodge van, I began to write again.</p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Stephen King.

  "<p>There is a problem with silver if you are trying to introduce it as part of a controlled colour theme in the garden. There are no silver flowers. Nature doesn't do silver petals. It mimics gold via yellow and does some good imitations of copper and bronze, but that silvery sheen, which you might think would be well suited to the satiny texture of many petals, simply is not found. When we started our Jewel-garden project, we thought that we could get round this by using suitable shades of white. But it doesn't work. White can, sort of, serve as diamond or, even diamant\u00e9. But if you are making a garden dedicated to jewels and our ill-spent 80s, then silver is a must. It is the setting. </p> <p>In fact, for silver you have to forget flowers and look to foliage and bark, hunting among the blues and greens. There is no silver foilage either, just shades of grey, at its most silvery when polished with moisture. This effect is not accidental. Many plants attain silveryness via tiny hairs on the surface of the leaves, which trap both light and moisture. So, as a general rule silvery, hairy leaves indicate a plant that is adapted to cope with drought. The most obvious examples of this are the felted leaves of Verbascums or Stachys byzantina. Of course, desert plants such as cacti use the opposite technique of having smooth, succulent leaves but also have that silvery bloom. </p> <p>Walking round the Jewel garden in mid-September, there is surprisingly little silver to be seen. I suppose that we could have incorporated water into the garden as a silver foil (ho! ho!) and there is an attractive logic to that, but it would have been quite a radical, expensive development. For the moment, all the silver must come from plants and the season has no use for silver's coolness or sophistication. This is a time of year when the colours tumble softly from their perch, richly jaded, and with none of the clean hardness of silver. There are the leaves of the weeping pear, Pyrus salicifolia 'Pendula', and the silvery blue stems of Knautia macedonica perfectly setting off its burgundy flowers. The leaves of the annual Salvia viridis - which has been fantastic this year - fade to a lavender-veined silver before turning into straw. Silver for just a week or so, but the phase adds much to balance the garden. The blue grasses, such as Festuca glauca and Miscanthus sinensis 'Morning Light', are still going strong, although to get a decent silver blue from the Festuca at this time of year, you must cut it back in early August. </p> <p> Miscanthus sinensis 'Silberfeder' has silver-pink plumes that look very good next to the plume poppy, Macleaya cordata. The blue oat grass, Helictotrichon sempervirens, has glaucous leaves and silvery plumes and is evergreen, so it lasts all year. 'Morning Light' is my favourite grass at the moment, with very long, languid leaves holding an exaggerated arch of grey-blue. Not silver at all really but, in this never-never land of the garden, it works well. </p> <p>There is a serious point here. You must use and judge colours in the garden in context and not by some objective colour wheel or household indicator. Evening light will always make colours seem richer and bring out the yellows, browns and reds, whereas morning light is cooler and best for pale colours. It follows that gardens which catch the morning sun will be inclined to be silvery and gardens that look best in the evening - which is the case with our Jewel garden - must use silver as more of a matte colour, an interval between other colours, rather than as an overall effect. Traditionally, silver is used to cool down and harmonise colours that would otherwise jar. Inevitably, silver foliage judiciously spaced out among the border will do this, but I like to think of it having a more positive role, focusing attention on itself rather than just being a neutral buffer. </p> <p>From early spring to early August cardoons do this with huge panache. Although most books simple refer to Cynara cardunculus as if it were the only type of cardoon, we have three quite distinct strains in the garden, one dwarfer than the other two, one with very deeply cut leaves and one with much wider, less cut and greyer leaves. The latter is planted as a separate long avenue, between pleached limes and underplanted with wallflowers, tulips and Allium giganteum. I like them best at the end of April, when the blood-red wallflowers contrast against the silvery grey of the cardoon leaves. We have more cardoons in the borders, although by now they are great, gaunt skeletons of their silvery selves, supported by posts and turning tawny. </p> <p>Another silver thistle that also needs support is the Onopordum acanthium, or Scotch thistle. Like the cardoon, it is a ghost of its former self and is so top heavy that it is best cut down now. Unlike the cardoon, it is biennial, and there are many young plants growing in the borders with rosettes of fresh, silver leaves. They are modest enough now to be moved to a suitable spacing at the back of a border, but if left until spring they will have developed tap roots and are less likely to survive transference. I would always want some Onopordums in my garden and in June they are top of the silver league, by far. </p> <p>Running a close second is the equally prickly, equally biennial Eryngium giganteum, or Miss Wilmott's Ghost. It got its vernacular name from Miss Wilmott's habit of dropping its seeds in every garden she visited. Miss Wilmott was from Essex, lived about 100 years ago, was very rich and sounds a bit of a pain. But it is a fantastic plant. All the Eryngium s are good, and we also have E. agavifolium, which is doing well but has a tendency to rot off. This is also true of E. bourgatii, which has vivid blue stems. I gave it lots of grit when planted, to mimic dry conditions. I also like the look of E. alpinum, which is the nearest thing to a silver flower that I have seen. </p> <p>Thinking about it, we could easily have an area of silver-blue leaves and white flowers. We tried white and green and it merely looked like a copy of Sissinghurst's white garden. No good - though the silver-blue would make the white pearly, and the foliage more silver. It also might temper the intensity of the existing planting and give it a cooler, more measured edge. We could have white tulips growing through the young Onopordums, or Artemisia 'Powis Castle' and then later add the Artemisa ludoviciana 'Valerie Finnis'. Shrubs such as Elaeagnus 'Quicksilver', Dusty Miller ( Senecio viravara ), or even Rosa glauca could be used, although we would have to cut the pink flowers off as they arrived. Seems a bit unkind. Certainly Tanacetum argenteum , the Dianthus 'Mrs Sinkins' and the white dead nettle Lamium maculatum 'White Nancy'. Yes to Salvia argentea and Ballota pseudodictamnus, although I don't know how much it would like our heavy clay. And so the game goes on. The real horticultural secret, to paraphrase the Incredible String Band, is to be a joyful player.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden </strong> </p> <p>We have had our winter supply of mushroom compost delivered. This is exciting for all sorts of reasons. First, there's the performance of getting it here via two big lorryloads driven across the water meadows, which is the only way to get anything larger than a barrow to the end of the garden. These could flood at any time and then access will be impossible - the ground freezes hard and doesn't get dry until summer. </p> <p>The compost makes one hell of a heap - 16-odd tons of lovely, jet-black, crumbly stuff. I would love to be able to say that we don't buy in anything and use just our own garden compost, but I guess that this delivery is as much as 20 times the finished compost we create each calendar year. We use it to dig into the vegetable garden - finding that it works better than anything to lighten and open out the soil - and to mulch the flower gardens. I keep the garden compost as a component of potting compost for mulching trees, hedges and shrubs, and for adding to planting holes.</p> <p>I turned the compost the other day, or rather did half a heap and then hurt my shoulder so, rather ignominiously, had to ask Gareth to finish the job while I pottered to the raspberries and pruned the summer ones. I love this job, cutting out all the old canes and thinning the new, tying them into a rhythmic row against the wires. I will give them a thick mulch after a decent amount of rain, but not with the mushroom compost, as it is too alkaline. Well-rotted cow manure would be ideal, as that is fairly acidic, but our garden compost will have to do.</p> <p>The raspberry prunings generate a lot of uncompostable canes and they go onto the heap to be shredded, along with the cardoon stems, artichokes, sweetcorn, summer-cabbage stems and masses of orache. When I last wrote about shredders, I received more mail than on any other subject - all of it saying how great shredders were. In principle I agree, but I have never used one that was robust or fast enough to be viable. Instead, we hire a commercial one every few months and have a day of it. I like having the piles of shredded stuff, mushroom compost, garden compost, grass from the orchard and leaf mould, all ordered and shipshape ready for winter. Then when the rain does finally come the ensuing mud will mean that it will be the end of wheelbarrows on the grass, let alone lorries across the field.</p> <p><strong>Your roots: Getting your garden ready for autumn </strong></p> <p>It is time to plant out wallflowers into their flowering positions so that they can grow and get established this autumn, ready to flower next spring. If any are straggly, pinch off the tops to make good, bushy plants. Keep busy with planting spring bulbs. I find this very tedious but it will pay handsome dividends next spring. </p> <p>Low light levels mean that tomato ripening has been very erratic and poor this summer. Any green tomatoes are unlikely to ripen now, so bring them in and store, on the vine, in a shed or in a drawer indoors. Many will ripen and the rest will make very good chutney. Or green- tomato soup.</p> <p>Check pears and apples daily, collecting windfalls and gently twisting fruit still on the tree to see if ready. Store unripe fruit on a window sill and ripe ones in a cool, airy, dark place.</p>",
  "<p>Every third year the World Bank and International Monetary Fund conduct their annual general meetings well away from Washington. The 1988 meetings in West Berlin were memorable for the first appearance of protesters: one recalls an orderly procession, followed rapidly by street cleaners picking up rubbish with Teutonic thoroughness. The 1988 meetings were especially notable for the fact that, amid all the forecasts unveiled, nobody, but nobody, predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. </p> <p>The 1991 meetings in Bangkok were dominated by the attempt to deal with the collapse of the Soviet Union. The 1994 meetings in Madrid featured a more agile form of protest, with members of Greenpeace disrupting the proceedings by performing acrobatics amid the rafters of the conference hall. The 1997 meetings in Hong Kong were held against the background of the Asian financial crisis. </p> <p>One has to hark back to the Seventies and early Eighties for meetings such as this one in Prague held against the background of an oil crisis. Those oil crises had been diagnosed as both inflationary, because they raised the price of oil sharply and gave rise to a price-wage spiral in many countries, and deflationary, because higher import bills removed purchasing power from consumers of oil to producers. </p> <p>It was generally agreed that the oil producers had such primitive economies that they could not possibly spend all their new-found wealth at once. The vogue term in those days was 'recycling' - the process by which the Opec countries deposited huge quantities of money with the western financial system, and these funds were 'lent on' to other countries. </p> <p>Before becoming an oil producer proper, even Britain itself had to borrow, in somewhat humiliating circumstances, from Iran, suffering a lecture from the Shah on how to run its economy. But many Opec funds were lent to - indeed almost forced on - developing countries, and there lay the origins of the Third World debt crisis. With the encouragement of the official international agencies, sound banking principles were abandoned and , after a routine series of questions about their economies, governments were asked: 'How much do you want?' </p> <p>A sudden increase in the price of oil is a classic example of what economists have in mind when they mutter darkly about 'external shocks'. Britain, as a net exporter of oil, gains extra revenues from such a shock, which is why the Treasury's initial reaction to demands for a reduction in fuel duty was somewhat disingenuous. The Chancellor has the money, if he so chooses, to make concessions without revising his plans for the building of a single hospital or the purchase of a single schoolbook. </p> <p>The fact that this is an external shock also gives the Bank of England's monetary policy committee some leeway, if necessary, in interpreting the need to raise interest rates to meet its infla tion target. An escape-clause is written into the legislation. As it happens, the course of UK inflation is well within the official 2.5 per cent target. Much depends on whether, as happened during the much bigger oil shocks of the Seventies, higher wage demands drive the general price level up, in circumstances where we are closer to full employment than we have been for many years. (Although forecourt competition produced a drop in petrol prices in August, during the past year, the rise in the price index, excluding oil has been negligible.) </p> <p>There is also the question whether, as David Rough of Legal &amp; General indicated last week, the Chancellor's ambitious public spending plans will act as a separate factor in stoking up inflationary pressures and interest rates. On the other hand, one of the reasons for the continuing budget surplus is that the public sector seems to have become so accustomed to 'cuts' that it cannot get its new spending act together. </p> <p>But Britain is highly dependent on developments in the world economy - indeed we have gained enormously from the prolonged world boom for which the US is principally responsible. And a sudden change of gear on this front - despite rather optimistic forecasts from the IMF - could mean the MPC worrying less about inflation than deflation. </p> <p>The big questions are: when and to what degree does the US boom come to its long-predicted end? And how serious is this latest oil crisis? </p> <p>The Bank of International Settlements - the central bankers' bank in Basle - has been issuing largely unheeded warnings for some time about the fragility of the US boom. And the latest Trade and Development Report (2000) from the United Nations raises the question: how long can the US economy continue being 'buyer of last resort' when it is borrowing more than $1bn a day from the rest of the world to do so? </p> <p>Keynes' classic insight was the danger of 'hoarding'. This applies within economies - hence the need, at appropriate times, for expansionary demand management - and between economies. A main cause of the 1997 Asian financial crisis was that western investors removed their money from East Asia. </p> <p>Indeed, as Unctad econo mist Yilmaz Akuz pointed out last week, money from Asia and elsewhere - not least the Eurozone - has been pouring into the US and fuelling a boom that has already had plenty of encouragement from the Federal Reserve. </p> <p>Nobody can accuse the American consumer of hoarding. He and she spend as if there were no tomorrow. But international policymakers are mildly concerned in public and very concerned in private about what happens when the US is finally forced to live within its means. It is partly for this reason that there has been so much concern about the eurozone: growth appears to be slowing in Europe, yet Europe is seen as the obvious locomotive to fuel world demand when the US has had enough. </p> <p>Which brings us back to fuel. One of the reasons this oil crisis is not considered as bad as previous ones is that, because government fuel taxes (outside the US) account for some 60 to 70 per cent of the final price, a tripling of the world oil price raises petrol prices by only around 20 per cent. </p> <p>Akyuz argues that there is even a case, in terms of demand management, for governments to lower such taxes if the present oil crisis does prove deflationary. In other words, the protesters might have an economic case.</p>",
  "<p>Not very long ago, William Aikens, a former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said: 'When the oil price rises above $30 a barrel, Saddam Hussein will be treated like Mother Teresa.' His statement sums up the indisputable connection between petroleum price, Iraq (possessing the second-largest oil reserves in the world) and Washington's policy towards Saddam. </p> <p>With Iraq producing 3.6 million barrels per day (bpd), its highest output ever, the removal of a United Nations' ceiling on its petroleum sales in January, and American oil corporations buying up a third of its oil exports, Saddam has become a major player in the market. </p> <p>This was acknowledged implicitly by America when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced recently that Washington would not use force to compel Iraq to accept inspectors of the newly formed UN Monitoring and Ongoing Verification and Inspection Commission (Unmovic). She then joined the UN ambassadors of Russia, France and China in urging Unmovic chief, Hans Blix, not to force the issue. </p> <p>This has enabled Saddam to become active, rather than reactive, in his foreign affairs. Hence his recent claim that by carrying out horizontal drilling near the Kuwait-Iraq border, Kuwait was stealing 300,000 barrels per day of Iraqi petroleum. </p> <p>Hence, too, his letter to the UN Security Council holding Saudi Arabia responsible for the losses that Baghdad suffered when Riyadh closed the oil pipeline from southern Iraq to the Saudi Red Sea port of Yanbo in August 1990. </p> <p>Saddam's aim in putting Kuwait and Saudi Arabia - big petroleum producers - on the defensive is to destabilise the oil market and spike up the price. He knows well how tight the current world petroleum market is - thanks chiefly to thriving economies all around the globe - and how vulnerable the US is on the issue of oil imports. </p> <p>Today 60 per cent of the 19 million barrels of oil Americans consume daily comes from abroad, double the levels seen in 1983. And the trend is set to continue. </p> <p>In the Nineties, oil output in the US declined by 15 per cent, while consumption rose by 11 per cent. With less than 5 per cent of the world population, America consumes 25 per cent of world oil output. It sucks up all the petroleum exports of Canada, Mexico and Venezuela. And it is becoming increasingly dependent on imports from the Gulf region, including Iraq. </p> <p>As soon as Iraq accepted the UN-administered oil-for-food scheme in December 1996, allowing it to sell $2 billion worth of petroleum in six months to buy food and medicine, Washington let it be known that US companies were free to buy Iraqi oil. </p> <p>And they did - for two years. Then, enraged by Operation Desert Fox, the Penta gon's 100-hour blitzkrieg against Iraq in mid-December 1998, Saddam ordered that no Iraqi oil be sold to American companies. </p> <p>But that did not happen. Indeed, according to the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, Iraq emerged as the fastest-growing source of US petroleum imports in 1999. </p> <p>US companies bought about a third of their Iraqi oil imports through foreign intermediaries. Their tankers loaded the commodity at an Iraqi oil terminal and sailed directly to American ports, often in the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>'The Chevrons and the Exxons of this world have to buy [Iraqi oil] from the Russians, the French and the Chinese traders,' said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. </p> <p>Saddam is well aware of the shipment of Iraqi oil directly to the US. 'That doesn't bother him,' said Vahe Petrossian, a London-based oil expert. 'By banning direct sales to American companies, Saddam deprived them of their trading profits. These now go to the middlemen from countries friendly with Baghdad - Russia, France and China.' </p> <p>Part of the reason for US corporations seeking out Iraqi crude is that an American law prohibits them from purchasing oil from Iran, Opec's second largest producer, whose output is on a par with Iraq's. </p> <p>All this is part of Washington's Dual Containment pol icy towards Tehran and Baghdad, adopted in May 1993. But the policy has been in tatters for the past four years, a fact the Clinton administration refuses to recognise. </p> <p>When it comes to repairing Iraq' rundown petroleum industry, the European subsidiaries of US oil equipment firms are in the forefront. Since mid-1998, making bids through their foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, more than a dozen US corporations have signed tens of millions of dollars'-worth of contracts with Iraq for oil-producing equipment . </p> <p>With the UN allowing Iraq to spend an average of $100m a month on repairing its petroleum industry, the pickings are rich. </p> <p>In July, Unmovic announced with much fanfare that its 44 inspectors from 19 countries were to take a month-long training course at New York's Columbia University to familiarise themselves with the historical, legal, administrative and political aspects of inspections and monitoring, and to become 'sensitive' to Iraqi culture. </p> <p>The snag is that Iraq has refused to accept last December's UN Security Council Resolution 1284, setting up Unmovic. So when Unmovic boss Blix said in August that a small team of his inspectors were ready to go to Iraq, his progress report was received with embarrassment rather than enthusiasm by the US. Half of the Unmovic inspectors have returned home. </p> <p>In the words of Henry Kissinger, a former US Secretary of State: 'Countries do not have friends or foes; they have interests.' And no interest is higher or more important in America than to keep gas-guzzling cars running, and homes and offices heated in winter. </p> <p>If that requires supping with the devil - renamed Saddam - so be it. </p> <p><strong>Rolling out the barrels: the supply chain</strong></p> <p><strong> Crude</strong> <br> When the price of oil was only $10 a barrel, in early 1998, Opec countries dependent on foreign earnings tried to bump it up to around $20 by cutting production to 2.6 million barrels a day in March and June. Nothing happened. They tried again with a 1.7 million cut in March: the price soared to $30 early this year. </p> <p>US pressure and concern that high prices were not in Opec's interest led to three production increases this year - 1.7 million barrels a day in March, 700,000 in June and 800,000 in September. But the price has not budged, because: </p> <p>\u0095 The shambolic quota system is inexact and often broken by Opec members. </p> <p>\u0095 Demand for oil is rising. </p> <p>\u0095 Crude is only one link in a complicated oil supply chain. </p> <p><strong> Shipping</strong> <br>The next link is shipping crude to market. The price charged by tanker owners to do this had gone up from $17,000 a day in September last year to $73,000 a day last month, says shipping broker Clarkson. This has raised shipping costs per barrel from around 60 cents to $2.60. The rise has been driven by a rebound after the Asian crisis, the scrapping of ships and demand for safer double-hulled vessels. </p> <p><strong> Refining</strong> <br>Next comes refining crude into products from petrol to heating oil. Refiners in Europe and the US were running below capacity last January. Now they are almost flat out, according to the Centre for Global Energy Studies. But as they have raised capacity, demand has risen, too. In the spring, US petrol stocks were down to 25 days. A massive rise in capacity had failed to lift that beyond 23 days by August. The result: higher prices at the pumps. The petrol problem is at last receding, only to be replaced by a similar difficulty over winter heating oil. </p> <p>\u0095 Dilip Hiro is the author of 'Dictionary of the Middle East', published by Macmillan, price \u00a320.</p>",
  "<p>Internal Whitehall estimates indicate that the Exchequer will receive at least an extra \u00a31 billion in fuel taxes this year as a result of the higher oil price - and possibly a lot more. </p> <p>The Treasury is so awash with funds that Gordon Brown could easily top the Conservative proposal of 3p off petrol duty, the cost of which is put at up to \u00a31.5bn. So far the Chancellor has maintained a tough line, but colleagues believe he will have to yield to public pressure. </p> <p>Privately, senior Government sources believe William Hague, the Tory leader, was rash to come out with such a precise figure. One Whitehall source said last night: 'The Conservative proposal does not go far enough to satisfy the protesters. Hague should have waited for us and then trumped our figure.' </p> <p>The official reaction to suggestions that fuel revenues are running at a much higher level has so far been to maintain that they amount to just a few hundred million. </p> <p>But this is only part of the story. When higher revenue from VAT and petroleum revenue tax (on the increased value of North Sea oil production) are taken together, the figure rises to \u00a31bn or more. </p> <p>Against recent prices of $33-$36 a bulk barrel, the Budget estimate was that oil prices would average only $22.40 this financial year. </p> <p>On top of that, booming tax revenues generally and public underspending have contributed to a position where City analysts are fore casting that the budget surplus this year will be nearer to \u00a315bn than the official forecast of \u00a35bn. </p> <p>But it would be a mistake to regard all of this as a 'war chest' against a background of International Monetary Fund and City worries that public spending plans will put strains on the economy.</p>",
  "The world has been turned on its head. If Britain was an island in every way, Mr Blair might still be 20 points ahead in the opinion polls, but a trebling in the world price of oil pushed the acceptability of high petrol taxes over the limit with consequences we know. But that's politics - a succession of unwanted events whose buffets governments survive if they have clear values, solid goals and are rooted in strong coalitions. <p>The heart of New Labour's problems is that it suffers deficiencies in all three. New Labour says the values in which it believes are economic efficiency and social justice. But neither are values in the sense that they provide a compass for coherent political action. Economic efficiency is an economic virtue while social justice is a desirable condition. Both beg the question of what values should create the policy which will deliver such a virtue and condition. </p> <p>Economic efficiency might be created by free markets or hard-headed planning; social justice could be delivered by a welfare state based on universal entitlements or generous means-testing. In short, you could be a conservative, liberal or socialist and still believe in economic efficiency and social justice. </p> <p>This then creates a second problem: to what extent, for example, should economic efficiency embody a notion of employee rights or a limitation on the rights of shareholders to maximise profits above any other business aim? Lacking values but wanting the virtue of economic efficiency, New Labour falls back on a conservative answer. Shareholder rights are sacrosanct and employee rights only legitimate to the extent that they are agreed by capitalists. </p> <p>It has an equal problem with social justice. It genuinely wills the condition, but its convictions are not so strong that they permit open income redistribution, regulation and entitlements which are citizens' rights. Instead, we must volunteer for more justice by working more to earn our tax credits, and the old must reveal their needs before they merit our help. The value is not solidarity - it is self-help and revealed need. </p> <p>And this opens up the last problem - the shallowness of its coalition. Unanchored in solid values and with a range of fungible goals, New Labour famously attempts to be all things to all people, but this hardly engages hearts and minds. The Labour tribe valiantly try to stay loyal - it's their government, after all - but it is not passionate, any more than are New Labour's recent converts, whose support is conditional on the Government being the conservative or liberal force they choose to think it might be. When the going gets tough, they desert. Knowing this weakness, New Labour tries to make good its deficiencies by top-down control and insistence that its people stay 'on message', reducing the Cabinet and the middle range of Ministers to little more than ciphers. </p> <p>Most Blair insiders vehemently dismiss arguments of this type; others have written thoughtful memos along these lines that do not get answered. But together, they at least partly explain the current calamity over petrol prices and some of the rockier debates at this week's party conference. With solid values, petrol duties could have been defended, for example, as green and an environmental necessity. With clear goals, they might have been more easily and passionately defended as the means to a just society - or never been allowed to get so high in the first place, because they obstructed that aim as a regressive tax. With a more solid political base, the collapse in the polls might have not been so abrupt. And if the leadership was more in touch with what its values have to be, it would surely not face stormy debates this week about its resistance to a democratically elected second chamber or restoring the earnings link to increases in the state pension. </p> <p>Yet the good thing that may emerge from the current cauldron is that it could prompt New Labour to rearticulate what its values are and thus what should constitute its goals and political coalition. As a political movement, it undoubtedly has the creativity and whatever its misfortunes, it is more fundamentally in tune with the times than the Conservatives. Higher quality public services, for example, are a more urgent necessity than income tax reductions. The intriguing element about today is not how much Conservative support has grown, but how little it has grown, and how much opinion has migrated to the Liberal Democrats. We may have a vocal Right that has discovered direct action, but this is not a solid right-wing country. </p> <p>The growth in Liberal Democrat support is not ephemeral - it has been increasing consistently for more than 20 years and is now reflected in its parliamentary strength. The principal reason is that its core values increasingly chime with those of an empowered, educated, individualistic but still fair-minded and tolerant society, but which has lost any conviction it had once had in the hopes of socialist idealists. British liberalism remained wedded to its commitment to individual liberty, even at the high point of socialism, but its concession was to take equality both of outcome and of opportunity more seriously. Wrestling with how to make two incompatible values consistent has left it with an attractive new philosophy - a powerful commitment to equity and accountability. </p> <p>Equity as a value encompasses equality but seasons it with the notion of fairness; thus, an equitable society is one which concedes that it might be fair for individuals to experience a measure of inequality if it promotes their liberty or rewards the intensity with which they have worked. But it must also be a society in which those who hold power in the private and public sector are held fiercely to account by a vigorous democracy embedded in a fair voting system and powerful regulation. </p> <p>Thus, the Liberal Democrats are able to advocate a marginal rate of tax of 50 per cent for those earning more than \u00a3100,000, not as a downpayment in the construction of socialism, but as a measure promoting equity. It is fair rather than socialist for those who earn more to pay progressively more tax. Their commitment to liberty permits gay marriages, their belief in accountability produces a belief in an elected House of Lords. Thus, they position themselves to exploit the complexities of how many people want to be taken seriously as individuals while also believing in a fairer society. And, all the time, they assume an unthreatening safeness. </p> <p>New Labour needs to move to the same position quickly. It should not be the champion of a House of Lords constituted largely by appointment, nor of a welfare system that has lost its commitment to social citizenship. It should be as uncompromising in its hostility to the Right as Charles Kennedy. Equity and accountability are the values that robustly underpin a centre-Left philosophy that can win general elections and offer a clear compass for policy. </p> <p>New Labour should adopt them as its own before it is outflanked by its still junior partner, a process that may be happening faster than any of us guess.</p>",
  "The two women embraced, leaping up and down in the kitchen to the open-mouthed stares of their small children. 'We did it!' whooped Katrina Kessell to her friend. <p>They had just heard that a 40-year-old neighbour in the Portsmouth housing estate of Paulsgrove had been asked to leave his job with a local taxi firm, sent on his way with a punch in the face from a fellow driver. </p> <p>Kessell shows the newspaper cuttings of the man's 1988 trial when he was convicted of indecent assault on a girl. Kessell and others of the Residents Against Paedophiles group found the cuttings in the library and made sure the cab firm knew about it. </p> <p>But the five women meeting last week in this council house kitchen have difficulties of their own. Kessell and 46 other Paulsgrove residents now face eviction from their homes by their landlord, Portsmouth City Council.</p> <p>The 47 are facing criminal charges as a result of taking part in the 'troubles' - last month's night marches and vigils against homes of alleged paedophiles living on the estate. </p> <p>'It is not us victimising these particular people, it is a standard policy for any tenant with anti-social behaviour. We will be awaiting the outcome of the court cases and then the appropriate action will be taken. A lot of people in Paulsgrove are looking to us to make them feel safe,' said a council spokeswoman.</p> <p>Sparked by the 'naming and shaming' of paedophile Victor Burnett by the News of the World after the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne, the first night of protests was the worst, with a car torched and windows smashed.</p> <p>Pictures of children on the marches carrying placards and wearing T-shirts with slogans like 'pervs out' made international news.</p> <p>It put such fear into 10 families that they fled their homes. Some were convicted sex offenders, some wrongly suspected. Most have been rehoused elsewhere.</p> <p>Since 10 August when the marches stopped and the media left, Paulsgrove has been dealing with the fallout. Last week, the leaders of a play scheme were subjected to eight-year-olds in their care chanting 'paedo, paedo' at them.</p> <p>On Friday, council contractors were repairing a house vandalised by children after its occupant left under police escort. The boarded-up windows bear the slogan 'Pervie Free'.</p> <p>Plans for a march to take place last night were dropped after the council met RAP representatives on Thursday and agreed to help take their campaign to the politicians. 'We're moving forward,' said mother-of-four Kessell.</p> <p>'Now our MP and the council are saying they will back us, which is good news. Now we want changes in the law. We want public access to the names and addresses of paedophiles; we want compulsory DNA tests on a database; we want better supervision of paedophiles leaving prisons and we want councils to be able to refuse to house them. If a paedophile has committed an offence against a child and gone to jail then when he comes out surely he has made himself homeless.'</p> <p>The irony of working with a local authority which may next month evict her and her children has not escaped Kessell or her 50-year-old mother, Mavis Canizares. 'All this is for the kids. But now how many kids may end up out in the street?' Canizares said.</p> <p>She sat in her kitchen surrounded by folders of legal documents, correspondence between RAP and police, cuttings on sex offenders, letters of support and even hate mail. There is also a file on the fund-raising RAP is doing to send children on the estate to a Christmas pantomine.</p> <p>The children are the centre of another deal struck last week between the council and RAP.</p> <p>School heads have had briefing meetings with teachers to discuss how to deal with children whose summer holidays had been spent marching round the estate late at night with their parents yelling 'paedos out' at strangers and being taught that perverts were waiting for them at every street corner.</p> <p>Now further moves are being made to help appease the protesters. 'The authority have now told Residents Against Paedophile representatives that we will be making sure every schoolchild in Paulsgrove gets an information pack on stranger danger,' said council official Karen Traviss.</p> <p>'We will also set up a workshop for parents in Paulsgrove to help adults with the difficult task of explaining to children how to deal with anyone - and we must remember that child abusers are often friends of, or within, families - who tries to touch them inappropriately.'</p> <p>'There is still a lot of anger in Paulsgrove, a lot of wounded people on both sides. Friends have fallen out and this is a tight-knit community. We want to work together to repair the damage.'</p> <p>It now seems to be a sentiment welcomed by the women of RAP. </p> <p>But in Kessell's briefcase on her mother's kitchen floor is the infamous list - the names of the men the group targeted. </p> <p>After much heated debate, 11 of the names were finally handed over to the authorities, who approached all those named and offered them rehousing help. </p> <p>The taxi driver was one who had chosen to stay. </p> <p>He may now have no option but to change his mind.</p>",
  "THE Ulster Volunteer Force - engaged in a murderous feud with rival loyalists - has warned the Irish government that any attempt to impose joint authority over Northern Ireland will be met with bomb attacks in the republic. <p>The UVF also insisted that its confrontation with an Ulster Defence Association faction in Belfast's Shankill Road was far from over. </p> <p>A senior UVF commander told The Observer that, while the organisation was pre-occupied with the feud, it was monitoring the deteriorating political situation closely. If David Trimble was ousted as First Minister and Dublin pressed for an alternative to the Good Friday Agreement on the lines of joint rule over Northern Ireland, the UVF would review its ceasefire. </p> <p>Ulster Unionist officials admitted yesterday that Trimble could soon face a vote of no confidence after his party's shock by-election defeat in South Antrim. John Taylor, the UUP's deputy leader, also warned that, if the Northern Ireland Secretary met nationalist demands to implement the Patten report on policing in full, this would be the signal for Ulster Unionists to withdraw from the power-sharing Executive. </p> <p>'There is no way we are ever going to back to the kind of tit-for-tat sectarian cam paign we saw in the past,' the UVF leader said. 'If there is to be resumption in the future caused by Dublin pushing things too far, then the organisation will be looking across the border.' </p> <p>The threat of bombs over the border in response to joint authority is more potent than ever before, given the stockpiles of weapons and explosives being uncovered in security operations aimed at clamping down on the loyal ist feuding in Belfast. Even within UVF ranks, the most pro-Agreement of the loyalist terror groups, there is growing disillusion with the direction of the political process. </p> <p>The RUC has found large amounts of plastic and home- made explosives alongside home-made mortars, rockets and grenades since the feud between the UVF and 'C' Company of the UDA in West Belfast began last August. The explosives used to destroy the Shankill Road offices of the UDA's political wing, the Ulster Democratic Party, last week were a compound of commercial powergel explosive and a new type of plastic explosive similar to Semtex. The UVF are understood to have acquired the plastic explosive from Eastern Europe. </p> <p>The arms finds in the Greater Shankill indicate that both loyalist terror groups have continued to smuggle arms and explosives into Northern Ireland despite their ceasefires and public support for the Agreement. </p> <p>The UVF commander stressed that the organisation continued to back the Agreement and wanted the peace process to survive. But there was increasing concern that, if Trimble and subsequently the power-sharing Executive fell, nationalists on both sides of the border would push for joint Dublin-London rule over the North. </p> <p>Asked about the likelihood of an early resolution to the feud, he said: 'Until the UDA national leadership takes control of \"C\" Company, then the chances of ending this are remote. </p> <p>'Even if it does end, the bitterness caused by people being expelled from their homes will last for generations. There is no mood for compromise among ordinary volunteers.' </p> <p>The UDA's leadership has so far rejected calls for it to distance itself from 'C' Company, whose members are confined to the Lower Shankill area.</p>",
  "<b> Elizabeth Browne, 35 Abbeymeads, Swindon, housewife</b> <p> I'm a long-term Labour supporter and I thought Tony Blair would probably have some radical, forward-looking ideas. He was right not to give in to the protesters, but Brown's reaction was harsh and provocative. I don't think that they handled it that well. I don't know if it's just the press, but it seems that hospital waiting lists are longer. My father, who lives in France, came to visit and was flabbergasted at the price of food and petrol. </p> <p> <b> Kamal Ladwa, 21 Freshbrook, Swindon, Student at Nottingham University</b> </p> <p> Labour have a tough job to do. I don't have a car, but the petrol crisis affected my lifts everywhere. It's a Catch 22 situation - I'm all right with fuel being taxed highly because of the environment. There's been no change in the NHS. I went for an operation recently. The NHS made me wait a month, so I had it done privately. It cost me \u00a31,000. There are no good options to vote for at the moment. The Dome was a joke, but I suppose the Conservatives would have done the same. </p> <p> <b> Pauline Venables, 75 Upper Stratton, Swindon, pensioner</b> </p> <p> I've voted Labour all my life. My husband and I share a state pension of \u00a3120 a week. My children pay my heating bills and so I manage to live comfortably. </p> <p>There's so much dissatisfaction at the moment; I've never heard so many Labour people complaining. </p> <p> There was not enough explanation by Labour for their position on the fuel strike, other than that they wouldn't give in to the protesters - who had a genuine grievance. </p> <p> <b> Jason Rickards, 30 Abbeymeads, Swindon, Business analyst</b> </p> <p> I was pleased when the fuel strikes happened. I get the bus every day and want to see more people using public transport,which, in this area, has improved. I voted for Labour in 1997 because I thought we needed a change. I liked their fresh approach, and I liked Blair: he's strong-willed and he knows what he wants. It's not really old Labour, but our generation likes it. If you look at the overall picture, we have 1.9 per cent inflation, interest rates lower than Germany and around one million people unem ployed. What's a few pence on petrol? I'd like to see Labour focus more on their successes. I can't understand their relationship with the press. People don't believe them; the spinning is out of control. They have to do something about that. </p> <p> <b> James Kent, 30 Stratton, Swindon, Taxi driver</b> </p> <p> I regret voting Labour in 1997. I seem to be worse off in virtually every respect. Fuel prices are rising, and my mortgage goes up every month. Blair didn't react to the fuel crisis that well. He told absurd lies - trying to get everyone to believe the NHS was on its knees. The protests were a long time coming, and we haven't seen the last of them. I'd be part of them myself if I had enough fuel to get there. With business as it is, I can't hold on for much longer. I can't see the country going any further with this government. They've lied, cheated and are fraudulent and corrupt. As for voting Labour, I won't be doing that again. </p>",
  "The backbench Labour MP does not wish to be named. He is nursing a majority around the 5,000 mark. His seat is in the South-east of England. It was won from the Tories at the last election. Two weeks ago he was confident of keeping his job and his \u00a345,000-a-year salary. Now he's not so sure. <p>Last week, as suddenly as the fuel crisis developed from small-scale blockades to full-blown national disaster, the nightmare scenario for the Labour Government emerged. Four opinion polls have suggested that the Conservatives could win the coming general election. Like so much spring snow, Tony Blair's 'impregnable' poll lead has evaporated from the political landscape. His personal ratings are down. He is blamed for the fact that the country almost ground to a halt two weeks ago. The Dome, pensions and a book by The Observer 's chief political commentator, Andrew Rawnsley, have come together to give this Government a bloody nose, cracked ribs and a black eye. </p> <p>Clare Short said last week that the Dome was 'a disaster'. Truckers said that Gordon Brown had to deliver on fuel tax cuts, or else. Barbara Castle said that it was time for action on pensions. And Rawnsley said the Chancellor had lied about the \u00a31 million party donation from Formula 1 racing millionaire Bernie Ecclestone. Blair himself, Rawnsley said, had slipped into mendacity. The Prime Minister has been silent. Now, this weekend, it is fight-back time. </p> <p>The next five days are vital for this Government. At their annual conference in Brighton, starting today, every one of the big Labour hitters will have their chance to reinvigorate support for the Government. They have been rattled. Suddenly the Tories are not such a laughing stock as before. </p> <p>'Whatever we say in public, of course we take notice of the opinion polls,' one Cabinet Minister said on Friday. 'There were those saying we had the next election in the bag. But I always thought the polls were underestimating the Tories' support. At least we now know where we stand. At least now we can concentrate political minds. The Tories can win.' </p> <p>For the backbencher, such a scenario was always possible. 'When you have a small majority, you know that you can lose, whatever the polls are saying,' he said. 'We had been lulled into a false sense of security.' </p> <p>Tony Blair's speech is on Tuesday. Senior Downing Street advisers say that he is going to map out 'the vision thing', something to throw the debate forward, to take this crisis-ridden Government away from the Dome and the fuel revolt and pensions, and set forth a new agenda - the improvement of schools, the health service, crime - on what this Government can do for you. It is critical. </p> <p>'We have to keep our nerve,' said John Prescott, Deputy Prime Minister and the man charged with ending the conference on a high with a tub-thumping 'trust us' speech on Thursday. </p> <p>'We need to be fully aware of what this Labour Government's done in carrying out its manifesto. [We need to] look forward to a second term. What this election is about is our justification to ask for a second term.' </p> <p>But future political seas look choppy. The Dome will not go away. Next month the National Audit Office report on the Greenwich attraction will be scathing about the financial mess. Many are predicting that Lord Falconer, the Minister in charge, will be forced to fall on his sword. </p> <p>Pensions will not go away. The conference will vote on the issue on Wednesday, and the Labour leadership is well aware it could be defeated. </p> <p>This week will also see the Danish referendum on entry to the euro with the No campaign leading in the polls. For the pro-euro Blair, a loss across the North Sea will only strengthen anti-euro campaigners here. </p> <p>And then there is Geoffrey Robinson, the former Paymaster-General, whose book, The Unconventional Minister , will for the first time detail his side of the \u00a3373,000 home loan he gave Peter Mandelson. It has already been bought for serialisation by the Daily Mail . Expect fireworks. </p> <p>Among all these icebergs, the Government has to keep some semblance of a straight line. Blair is arguing in Downing Street that his administration must not appear to be knocked off course by every passing disaster. They must try and rise above it all, but also appear to be listening and responding. It is a difficult trick to pull off. </p> <p>Prescott, speaking to The Observer last week, said that now, more than ever, it is imperative for the Government to define the clear dividing lines between Labour and the Conservatives - some tax and some spending versus less tax and, the Government argues, less spending. 'Yes, we have some problems. Everyone can see that we have issues which people are expressing strong concerns about; for example, pensions and fuel. We can show substantial evidence of where we have been listening and our solutions in logic and in application are fair, if you believe that those less well off should have the priority. You have to convince electorates and they have got to feel what you are saying is right.' </p> <p>He knows that the Government has a message to sell, but somehow it is not getting through. Does the tone have to change? Maybe, Prescott admits, a line also pushed by another member of the Cabinet who spoke to The Observer . What is clear is that you can't go on simply blaming the press. </p> <p>'It's for the Government to prepare its programme to convince an electorate that it's acting in its interests. If it's able to deliver in a confident way and has a good record of delivery - which this Government has without a doubt - keep your nerve, be proud of what we've done, but get out and tell them. </p> <p>'I am not a great one for polls, but I have noticed them. We've had unpopular polls - about transport two years ago and we dealt with the problem and we got the economy right and we put a huge amount of investment in and everybody said that's good. We did the same for hospitals and everybody said that's good and the polls tended to show it. We had unpopular polls in the spring and after the comprehensive spending review and the health expenditure and the transport expenditure; in the summer we improved and we showed that we were delivering.' He believes fortunes can change again. </p> <p>Matthew Taylor, the head of the well connected left-wing think-tank, the Institute of Public Policy Research, says that a little contrition wouldn't go amiss. 'Sometimes you have to eat humble pie,' said Taylor, who was assistant general secretary of the Labour Party before the last general election and was a senior member of the campaigns team. 'There needs to be a line drawn under the recent problems, some excitement needs to be created about new government initiatives. The debate needs to go forward.' </p> <p>Prescott, like so many politicians, cannot stomach the word 'sorry'. Keep apologising for everything and in the end nobody will trust you, he argues. 'Have you ever heard an editor [of a newspaper] apologise for getting something wrong? Blimey, if you adopted that principle when you got things wrong every paper would have the editor up every day apologising for what he had wrong.' He doesn't want the Government going down the same track. </p> <p>'Labour will lose the next election if it can't maintain the trust of the people,' he says. 'That will always be so. We must never be complacent, that is something the Prime Minister always says. Never take the electorate for granted.' </p> <p>Pollsters agree. Professor John Curtice, polling expert at Strathclyde University, says that the reason that the polls swung so swiftly against Blair (from a 20 per cent lead two months ago to a 4 per cent Tory lead last week) is because the Government committed the cardinal sin in the eyes of the people. The fuel crisis and Dome revealed a Government not in control of events. </p> <p>The last time there has been such a violent swing in the polls was at the time of the Falklands War, when Margaret Thatcher increased Tory support by 10 per cent. She was tough, in control. Blair appears to have vacillated on fuel and has remained silent on the Dome. </p> <p>But before Conservative Central Office starts hanging out the bunting, a word of caution. A careful reading of the performance of past governments in the opinion polls would offer Blair some comfort - and give William Hague a salutary warning. </p> <p>The over-riding point is that governments almost invariably gain ground as election day approaches. In the autumn of 1986, as last week, the Opposition held a narrow lead over the Government. Then, as now, a bald Opposition leader lagged in the personal popularity stakes behind a Prime Minister whose habit was to lead from the front. Then, as now, there was much talk of the governing party losing its landslide majority and facing a hung Parliament. And what happened? The following spring, the governing party - the Tories under Thatcher - returned to power with a 100-seat majority. </p> <p>Nor was that an isolated event. In nine of the past ten full Parliaments, the final six-to-nine months have seen a swing from Opposition to Government. What seems to happen with a fair degree of regularity is that some people who tell pollsters they yearn for a change when no election is imminent decide in the end that the incumbents aren't so awful after all. It even happened in the run-up to the 1997 general election. The Tories' 31 per cent on polling day was terrible enough - but it was significantly higher than their ratings throughout 1995 and 1996. </p> <p>So if history repeats itself, Labour ought to win an election next spring reasonably comfortably. What, though, if the polls next March show the race too close to call - say, Labour no more than five points ahead? It is at that point that Blair must decide whether to call a May election or wait until the autumn of next year or the following spring. Looking at what happened over the final 12-18 months of past Parliaments, the story is even more dramatic, with often huge Opposition leads either being cut back sharply or being overturned altogether. </p> <p>The Tories must face the fact that, even after moving into the lead for the first time in eight years, they remain the second most unpopular Opposition at this point in the political cycle in the 60-year history of polling. Only Labour in the autumn of 1982 stood lower . Yet suppose history does not repeat itself. What if the Tories stay narrowly ahead right through to polling day? Blair could still remain Prime Minister, for Britain's election system is now tilted in Labour's favour. If both Labour and Tories win the same number of votes, Labour is likely to have around 80 more MPs. To be sure of having more seats than Labour, the Conservatives need a 7 per cent lead in the popular vote. </p> <p>There are three main reasons for this: </p> <p>* Labour-dominated parts of Britain tend to have smaller constituencies than Tory-dominated areas. If constituencies in Wales and Scotland were the same size as in England, they would elect 23 fewer MPs; Labour would lose 19 of them. </p> <p>* Turnouts in strong Labour areas tend to be lower than in traditional Tory areas. Low turnouts in safe Labour seats drag down the party's national vote share by two-to-three points, but do not cost it any seats. </p> <p>* In 1997 tactical voting cost the Tories up to 35 seats. </p> <p>David Miliband, the unassuming but fiercely intelligent young head of Blair's policy unit, said two weeks ago he believed the first term in power had actually been all about proving Labour was a 'serious party of government', establishing its economic competence, airbrushing out the bad memories. </p> <p>'This Labour Government is establishing a new collective memory about what it means to be a New Labour Government. Gone is the winter of discontent: in its place a national minimum wage. </p> <p>He also highlighted a key New Labour problem, knee-jerkism, revealed in all its ridiculous glory earlier this year by the Prime Minister's sudden announcement that louts would be marched to cash machines to withdraw \u00a3100 to pay on-the-spot fines. Blair wanted to be seen doing something about crime. Two days later the idea was abandoned as unworkable. </p> <p>Miliband said: 'On every maths A-level paper it says please read the question carefully before you start to answer,' he warned. 'In the Government often the temptation is to rush in to give the policy answers before you really know what the question is.' </p> <p>Miliband argues that the key lesson he draws from Al Gore's presidential campaign in America is that the Centre-Left can succeed if it fights on the issues. Gore was behind Bush in the polls, started arguing about health and education, and is now ahead. </p> <p>'The lesson is that substance beats froth,' Miliband said. 'Essentially the Tories made a decision to attack us on a lot of trivial stuff, but when we produced the national plan [for health], the CSR [Comprehensive Spending Review], that won out.' </p> <p>Labour officials insist that the week's polls do not reveal some catastrophic shift in the social democratic consensus that was built to win the election in 1997. Get back onto policies and away from the horror of events and the government ship will stop listing. But that's the problem with events.

  "The Russian-made rocket propelled grenade fired at MI6's headquarters on the Thames caused only minimal material destruction but produced maximum political damage. The Real IRA 'spectacular' resulted in a broken window, a scarred building and traffic and rail chaos around Vauxhall Cross and Waterloo station. <p>The political fallout of the RPG attack has been enormous. It was the first major propaganda coup for the dissident republicans. A daring sortie on such an obvious symbol of the British establishment will have impressed many young disaffected republicans contemplating joining anti-ceasefire terror groups. The MI6 attack will undoubtedly be a useful recruiting tool for the Real IRA. </p> <p>The initial political target of the Real IRA's third and most spectacular strike in London, though, was David Trimble and the faction of his Ulster Unionist Party that still supports the Good Friday Agreement. The rocket was fired on Wednesday night fewer than 12 hours before polls opened in the South Antrim parliamentary by-election. </p> <p>An intensification of the Real IRA's terror campaign in Britain would simply confirm the fears of many UUP voters in the constituency that the Agreement had not brought about the peace and stability Tony Blair and Trimble had promised it would. </p> <p>Combined with the ongoing loyalist feud, many unionists in South Antrim clearly concluded that Blair's promises about peace and no terrorist representatives in government were not worth the paper they were written on after the Agreement was signed in Easter 1998. </p> <p>Judging by the South Antrim result, a stunning victory for Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists in what was once regarded as the UUP's second safest seat in Northern Ireland, the Real IRA's timing was perfect. The Rev William McCrea, the DUP's bible-thumping, gospel singing candidate, overturned the UUP's 16,000 majority. </p> <p>Trimble's allies and later Peter Mandelson attempted to put a spin on the size of the defeat, blaming voter apathy, the rain on Thursday and that old chestnut, the media, for McCrea's triumph. The turnout was remarkably low by Northern Ireland standards - just 43 per cent of the electorate bothered to vote. McCrea's majority over his main rival, the former British Airways publicity director David Burnside was a mere 822 votes. Yet none of this can disguise the fact that the result is a severe slap in the face not only for Trimble but also Blair. </p> <p>According to UUP members canvassing for Burnside there were two 'killer issues' confronting them on the doorsteps - anger over the Patten reforms of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the perception that Blair had gone back on his pledges, particularly his promise that parties linked to paramilitaries (ie Sinn Fein) could not sit in government until there was actual decommissioning. </p> <p>Most unionists see the ditching of the RUC name, the dumping of the harp and crown cap badge and Patten's proposal that there be some local political control over the new police force as unacceptable sops to Sinn Fein and an insult to the 323 officers killed during the Troubles. South Antrim contains a number of Protestant middle-class redoubts populated by serving and retired police officers. </p> <p>One UUP canvasser summed up the attitude of this crucial 'police constituency' in South Antrim: 'They said they would either vote for McCrea just to register a protest against Patten and Blair or else not turn up to vote at all. They said they felt sorry for Trimble, that he had been betrayed by the Prime Minister.' </p> <p>The British Government tried to put a brave face on a terrible setback. Peter Mandelson insisted that while the result indicated 'some unease' within the unionist community too much was being made of McCrea's victory. </p> <p>'If you infer anything from result, it is that faced with the choice between two anti-agreement unionists, many unionists chose to stay at home and not vote at all,' he told reporters at his residence in Hillsborough castle on Friday night. </p> <p>The liberal non-sectarian Alliance Party repeated the mantra claiming that pro-Agreement unionists had no one to vote for because David Burnside had declared he no longer supported the Good Friday deal. Alliance candidate David Ford however failed to mention that had his party not stood then the bulk of the 2,003 votes they received would probably have gone to the UUP and kept McCrea out. </p> <p>Given the reaction of senior UUP figures, Mandelson's assertion that the result does not damage the Agreement sounds like wishful thinking. John Taylor, the UUP deputy leader and MP for Strangford, is regarded as the weather vane of Ulster Unionism. If Taylor turns against the Trimble project then the majority of the party, including that critical band of wavering sceptics, will follow suit. </p> <p>Yesterday Taylor condemned any attempt to challenge Trimble's leadership but warned that the UUP's continued participation in the power-sharing executive at Stormont was under review. </p> <p>Taylor cited the period directly after the UUP annual conference on 7 October as make or break time for the Northern Ireland government. The British Government will publish the final draft of the Bill on policing reforms which unionists suspect has been scheduled after the UUP conference to enable Mandelson to placate Seamus Mallon, the SDLP deputy leader, who wants Patten implemented in full. </p> <p>John Taylor said: 'David Trimble's leadership is excellent and the party would be very very foolish to try and replace him at such a critical time. However, the breaking point is coming for us soon. If the Policing Bill leaves the RUC irrevocably damaged then I would say that this is the time to pull out of the Executive. There is no sense in having a situation where the Ulster Unionist Party is going to fall into electoral oblivion. If nationalists insist on getting their way entirely on policing then they will have done irreparable damage to the Belfast Agreement. They are pushing unionists too far.' </p> <p>The UUP deputy leader's remarks hint to a possible strategy ahead for the party that falls short of ditching Trimble. The Ulster Unionists will use the threat of the DUP and other anti-agreement unionist forces eclipsing them to extract more concessions on policing from the British Government. </p> <p>Even those firmly in the No camp, such as the Lagan Valley MP Jeffrey Donaldson, are known to be reluctant to organise a coup d'etat against Trimble. The Observer has learnt that a number of UUP MPs have approached Donaldson over the weekend urging him to put his name forward. One plan they floated to him was that the Rev Martin Smyth, the South Belfast MP, would offer to stand as a caretaker leader until after next year's expected general election and then be replaced by Donaldson. </p> <p>Smyth came close to defeating Trimble in a leadership challenge earlier this year when he received 47 per cent of the votes from the party's ruling body, the Ulster Unionist Council. But the young pretender to Trimble's throne is thought to be wary of a Smyth-Donaldson ticket, preferring instead to push forward a motion calling on the party to pull out of the Executive until the IRA hands over guns and bombs. </p> <p>As for Trimble himself, the UUP leader and First Minister insists he will fight on. He still believes the Agreement is more resilient than his internal opponents are making out. Yet Trimble must be mindful of recent history, particularly his own path to power. </p> <p>Five years ago his predecessor, Lord Molyneaux, blamed voter apathy for his party's defeat in the North Down by-election at the hands of the most articulate sceptic of the peace process, Robert McCartney. Following McCartney's triumph, Molyneaux attributed the low poll (38.8 per cent) to the fact that North Down had suf fered the least from 'terrorist savagery' charging that the affluent class in Bangor, Cultra and other rich corners of the constituency had forsaken unionists living on the border. After Thursday's routing by the DUP, Trimble also blamed apathetic Ulster Unionist supporters for letting McCrea snatch the seat. </p> <p>Trimble would do well to remember that just months after Molyneaux made his gaffe about North Down, he was forced to step down as party leader.</p>",
  "<p>A black day. Mob rule. A green light to wanton vandalism. A blow against the rule of law. It was clear from the papers that the end of civilisation was finally upon us. And who was responsible for this cataclysmic event? Seven men and five women, chosen at random from the electoral roll: the Norwich jury which found 28 Greenpeace volunteers, including me, not guilty of criminal damage. I expected the establishment reaction to be hostile - it was hysterical. </p> <p>The charge arose from an action by Greenpeace when we tried to remove a crop of genetically modified maize from a field near Lyng. The prosecution alleged that it was a stunt. We proved we acted lawfully in defence of property. The crop was about to flower, threatening cross-pollination of neighbouring crops. Once such genetic pollution escaped, it could not be recalled. We aimed to cut down and bag up the entire field and return it to Aventis, the agrochemical company that owned the crop. </p> <p>The owner of the field had refused to meet his neighbours to discuss whether they wanted GM crops in the vicinity. He and the chemical company decided simply to impose the contamination on them. The real victims of this episode are the local farmers who may not be able to sell crops contaminated by GM. </p> <p>Genetic engineering is a complex issue, probably the most complex and certainly one of the most serious Greenpeace has ever grappled with. But what has been the response of the liberal media and London salon society which have promoted deliberative democracy with such fervour? Shocked indignation that the jurors have had the temerity to challenge what they assumed to be scientific certitude. </p> <p>There seem to be two key objections to what we did: that we seemed to challenge the need for scientific progress; and we took direct action. The Government tells us the farm-scale trials will show whether GM crops pose a threat to human health or the environment. This is just not true - the trials are not about human health at all, even though the Government claims that they are. Nor are they about whether GM crops will contaminate non-GM ones; the Government and its scientific experts long ago accepted that contamination is inevitable, but think it does not matter. </p> <p>Nor are they about whether GM crops will pollute the soil they grow in. They are simply about whether farmers growing GM crops will use more or less weedkiller, a question which could have been answered by looking at the experience of GM crop cultivation in North America. We know that the answer is mixed - sometimes more chemicals are used, sometimes less. </p> <p>We do not need GM crops to reduce our dependence on chemical weedkillers - we need research into fulfilling the potential of organic farming. The farm scale trials aim to establish something we do not need to know, at a risk of irreparable damage to the environment. To oppose them is not to be anti-science, but simply to recognise that there are some things which cannot be justified in the name of science. </p> <p>And what of direct action? I believe it is a legitimate tactic, but only in some forms and in clearly defined circumstances. First and most important, it must be non-violent. Second, it should be used only after other avenues have been explored. Third, it should be in defence of a clear moral principle, not an attempt to impose the economic self-interest of a particular group on the rest of society. Fourth, it should be to prevent a real and immediate threat, such as genetic pollution. </p> <p>Greenpeace disagrees with the aims of those who blockaded refineries - the true cost of petrol and diesel, taking account of climate change and damage to human health, is far higher than the price we pay at the pumps - and with their methods. It was a clearly implied threat and self-interested, motivated by issues often unrelated to transport. </p> <p>There is another important point about Greenpeace's involvement in direct action. We do not conceal our identities or evade arrest. We challenge particular laws, but not the rule of law. We take responsibility for our actions and are happy to be judged, fairly, for them.</p>",
  "<p>Britons were yesterday among the thousands of protesters turned away from the Czech border by police determined to minimise the extent of Tuesday's anti-capitalism protest, organisers said. </p> <p>About 30,000 demonstrators from across Europe are heading towards Prague this week, determined to disrupt the 55th Annual Meeting of the World Bank Group and the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). </p> <p>But instead of taking part in today's mass celebration, a warm-up before the main day of action next week, many demonstrators have spent the weekend camping at border crossings in pouring rain. </p> <p>Some have managed to complete their journeys by complaining to their embassy or by appealing to legal observers waiting behind the border controls. But thousands of others - at least one in every 50 demonstrators - are spending days travelling from one border crossing to another, unsuccessfully trying to find a weak link in the police line, before being forced to return home. </p> <p>'Czech border police are not making illegal demands on those attempting to enter the country, but they are sticking to the letter of the law with absolute rigidity,' said Karlos, a legal observer working for the Initiative Against Economic Globalisation, an umbrella group known by its Czech initials, Inpeg, created to coordinate this week's demonstrations. </p> <p>More than 70 protesters have been denied access to the Czech Republic from the border crossing at Zinnwald alone, in what organisers claim is a total contradiction of state rhetoric. </p> <p>'Nine-hour waits at the borders are now routine because police are searching exhaustively for ways of banning everyone they possibly can,' said Karlos. 'Occasionally they cross over and violate a human right, but on the whole they stay a hair's breadth away from actual violation.' </p> <p>Many activists have been caught by obscure legislation. 'I'm shaking with anger, but I'm not leaving. l'll find some way of getting through, even if it takes all week,' said Anya, a 35-year-old activist who spent more than 24 hours driving from Brighton to Prague in her 35ft van, only to be blocked at Zinnwald after Czech police found a slight irregularity in her vehicle registration papers. </p> <p>'I've travelled all over the world with exactly the same papers I gave the police here,' she said. 'I even came to Prague last year. They let me in then and now suddenly the same papers aren't good enough.' But Anya's case does not surprise Karlos, a legal observer on the other side of the crossing. 'Cases like this show how little truth there was in the words of the Czech government when it said we had a political right to protest against the IMF meeting. This entire demonstra tion has shown how determined the Czech government really is to deny the right to free speech and political protest,' he said, as he rang around trying to order the papers Anya needed. </p> <p>'They see this meeting as a method of entry into the serious world of big-boy politics and are prepared to deny the right the public has to express a plurality of political views.' </p> <p>Border police are using information from the FBI and Scotland Yard on known activists to prevent people entering the country, including activists from Seattle and Ya Basta!, a pressure group from Italy . </p> <p>Despite the difficulties, thousands of activists have successfully got in: a camp for 20,000 people on the outskirts of the city is already busy and most hostels and cheap hotels are booked up for the entire week. But police hope that, by flexing their muscles now, they will curb protesters' plans to disrupt the conference later in the week. </p> <p>Their plan appears to have worked: yesterday's nine peaceful demonstrations are being heralded by the police as proof that their months of preparation have been a success, although today's mass celebration will test that claim. </p> <p>Nevertheless, tension in Prague has escalated over the past few days in anticipation of Tuesday's demonstration. About 11,000 police, most of them in riot units trained to deal with violent fights rather than peaceful demonstrations, have been mobilised. They have admitted that tear gas and water cannon will be used if necessary. </p> <p>Six armoured personnel carriers, six troop trucks, two fire engines, two Mi-17 helicopters and two W-3A Sokol helicopters are on standby, according to the Prague Post . </p> <p>'We know there are many protesters coming here with the intention of sabotaging the conference,' said a spokesman for the Czech police. 'Of course, we're nervous - this is the first major demonstration we have had to cope with, but if people complain we're too strict, well, rather that than a repeat of the devastation caused by the Seattle riots last November.' </p> <p>Prague, a Communist citadel for four decades until 1989, has reverted to a Soviet-era bunker mentality, closing more than 1,000 public schools and running a three-month series of alarmist advertisements on television and in the press, warning of the devastation which could hit the city this week. </p> <p>Many of Prague's 1.2 million citizens have responded by deserting the city but, keen to avoid a repetition of last year's much-criticised May Day riots in Prague, police have agreed to work with 100 volunteer legal observers stationed around the city who will report any violation of human rights. A hotline has also been set up by Inpeg for protesters to report incidents of abuse. </p> <p>There are tentative signs that the week could pass off smoothly: a right-wing dem-onstration against globalisation that many feared would act as a catalyst for the latent violence lurking here passed off smoothly yesterday, and police attendance was attentive but hands-off. </p> <p>Even so, protesters are unlikely to find support among older Czechs, said Danielle, 24, a member of the first free generation in the region for 50 years. </p> <p>'There is practically no one in our parents' generation who has sympathy for this demonstration,' she said. 'The government has emphasised again and again over the past few months how awful it will be here during the conference, but they have not explained the reason why we feel the need to protest.'</p>",
  "A gun-toting Yardie gangster who threatened to shoot three people in a road rage incident was being accompanied by an undercover police officer who could not intervene, it has been revealed. <p>The incident, which took place in broad daylight on the streets of central London, is documented in a new book about Scotland Yard's covert operations unit, known as SO10. In a second twist, it has emerged that the gunman had actually been brought to London by the Metropolitan Police as part of a scheme to gather more information about Yardies in the capital. </p> <p>He was paid 'lifestyle' expenses of \u00a3500 per week, given a mobile phone and a two-year-old Golf GTi to drive. He was booked into a plush hotel but later moved to a two-bedroomed flat in Docklands with a monthly rental of almost \u00a31,000. All his expenses - rent, clothes, food and drink - were settled weekly by Scotland Yard. </p> <p>The revelation is certain to fan the flames of controversy that have dogged police attempts to tackle black organised crime. </p> <p>According to Philip Etienne, the undercover officer assigned to escort Skank during his first two months in London, the gangster was one of a number of known criminals specially imported to provide information about Yardie crime. The road rage incident confirmed his suspicions that such men were almost impossible to control. </p> <p>'I was driving down a narrow road near Dean Street when a Jeep appeared coming in the other direction. I stopped and went to reverse to let them get by but Skank knocked my hand away and insisted that we wait until they moved. Eventually the driver, a young woman, came out to complain and Skank just ripped into her, insulting everything about her. There were two other guys in the Jeep and they came over, looking for a fight. Skank jumped out, reached for a gun hidden in the folds of his jacket and threatened to shoot unless they moved.' </p> <p>Etienne could do nothing while playing the part of a gangster; luckily the Jeep driver gave in. Skank later brought a bodyguard from Jamaica at police expense and he moved into the Docklands flat. The operation was abandoned a few months later and both men vanished, leaving unpaid bills. </p> <p>Bringing Skank to London was an extension of a scheme Scotland Yard adopted in the early Nineties when it was recognised that only true Jamaicans known in criminal circles were able to mingle freely with the Yardie gangs. </p> <p>In 1994, Delroy Denton, a Yardie arrested while entering the country illegally, was persuaded to become an informer. He was released into the community while the authorities considered his application for political asylum. Denton had a history of extreme violence in Jamaica, including the ice-pick murder of a prostitute. In the 11 months after his release, Denton was accused of raping a 15-year-old schoolgirl and then jailed for life for raping and murdering Marcia Lawes, a 24-year-old mother of two in Brixton. </p> <p>The Infiltrators by Philip Etienne and Martin Maynard with Tony Thompson is published by Michael Joseph on 28 September, price \u00a315.99</p>",
  "A team of scientists in St Petersburg has developed a new style of drug from the organs of newborn calves which, they claim, slows down the human ageing process so radically that life expectancy could be increased to 110. <p>Some senior Kremlin politicians, prominent businessmen, leading footballers and ballerinas have started to make twice-yearly visits to a clinic in one of the city's up-market suburbs, hoping to prolong their lives with a course of treatment from the former military doctors responsible for the new formula. One of the most popular aspects of the therapy is that there is no need to begin early; on the contrary, doctors claim the best results are achieved among people who start when confronted by symptoms of middle age. </p> <p>Earlier this year the directors of Gazprom, the gas giant that is Russia's largest business, signed a contract with the institute to provide the therapy for about 300,000 members of staff in a drive to reduce sick leave and boost employees' enthusiasm for work. Preliminary results, they claim, are very positive. </p> <p>The treatment centres on a series of medicines, named bioregulators, made from isolated animal organs designed to echo and support the functions of the equivalent organs in humans. Scientists at the institute are particularly excited by the effects of two of their creations - thymalin and epithalamin - which they say mirror the work of the body's immune system and hormonal system respectively. By taking these drugs, they claim, patients can rejuvenate the functions of these systems, thus staving off both the ageing process itself and the illnesses which accelerate it. </p> <p>'These discoveries are as important as the development of the atomic bomb. It is colossally significant for the whole of mankind,' declared Vladimir Khavinson, a specialist in gerontology - the study of ageing processes - who is responsible for much of the research. Judging by his huge apartment in an ostentatious new development for St Peterburg's elite (equipped with a television in every room), his work has proved extremely lucrative. </p> <p>Thymalin is created from thymus glands (thought to regulate the work of the immune system) taken from calves aged under a year. Epithalamin is made from young animals' epiphysis glands, which the scientists claim control the body's metabolism. </p> <p>In a series of tests on mice and rats over 25 years, life expectancy of those animals treated with both drugs increased by between 30 and 45 per cent, and now doctors at the St Petersburg Institute of Bioregulation and Gerontology are confident that the same effect will be seen on humans, allowing them to live healthily well into their second century. They claim that, under this treatment, age-related diseases can can be minimised and capacity to reproduce will be extended for men and women. </p> <p>No independent research has been done to corroborate these claims, but the mere suggestion that the institute may have discovered an elixir which prolongs youth has aroused huge international interest. A team of venture capitalists from Britain (including one of the Rothschilds) is in negotiations to sponsor research as well as the patenting and registering of several preparations. </p> <p>Pharmaceutical corporations in Germany and the United States are also interested in backing the development of new synthetic versions of the animal-based products. 'Doctors in the West are very suspicious of medicines developed from the bone stems and inner organs of animals because of the BSE crisis, so we have been forced to work on synthetic copies which are much more acceptable to the Western mentality,' Khavinson said. 'These synthetic drugs are the future.' </p> <p>There is scepticism among those who warn that charlatanism always lies behind such claims. Robert Music, deputy director of the UK charity Research into Ageing, said he would caution against spending money on this kind of drug. 'As far as we know, it is just not possible to extend human life expectancy like this.' </p> <p>The unsuspecting original sponsor of the research was Russia's Ministry of Defence in the early 1970s, when Khavinson and his colleague, Vyacheslav Morozov, were young colonels in a military medical academy. Commissioned to develop ways to help soldiers recover from radiation exposure, chemical poisoning and various injuries, they invented the drugs they now promote as life-expectancy boosters as a way to restore damaged body functions. </p> <p>'These kind of injuries have the same effect as a speeded-up form of ageing. While we were testing the new drugs on rats, we discovered that they simultaneously extended the lives of the animals. The Defence Ministry had no particular interest in developing a drug to prolong life, so we continued our research in secret, but the work would never have been possible without the huge sums of money allocated to us by the government,' Khavinson said. When the Soviet Union broke up, he set up a private institute. </p> <p>Visitors to the St Petersburg clinic are confronted by expensive medical technology of a sophistication unseen in most Russian hospitals. Patients are subjected to DNA testing and presented with a genetic passport determining which diseases they are likely to be susceptible to; on the basis of this test they are given a course of extra bioregulators in addition to the standard immune and hormone system boosters. The basic 10-day course of injections costs about $100 (\u00a369). </p> <p>A less-than-inspiring advertisement for the clinic comes with the revelation that, while he was still President, the ailing Boris Yeltsin was sent some of the drugs. Doctors at the institute claim that while he received their treatment his condition improved, but add hastily that he did not continue with the therapy.</p>",
  "The female of the species has always been as deadly as the male in the annals of Eta, the Basque separatist group, but women are now becoming increasingly influential. <p>Eleven murders have been attributed by the police to hardliner Mar\u00eda Soledad Iparragirre Genetxea, 39, whom they say is set to become the military leader of the group which last week killed its thirteenth victim since ending a truce in December. </p> <p>Born in the Basque village of Escoriaza and known as 'Anboto', she is on track to replace Ignacio Grac\u00eda Arregi, arrested in France last weekend, as head of Eta's military apparatus. According to her police dossier, she began working with the Vizcaya commando while a teenager, helping to store explosives, then moved in 1985 to the Araba commando and worked with Jos\u00e9 Javier Ruiz Arizcuren, 'Kantauri', a high-profile Etarra arrested last year. In March of that year she allegedly took part in a machine-gun attack on a police patrol and television technicians at a sports centre. In June, she is alleged to have killed a postman. </p> <p>A glimpse of Anboto emerged recently from the trial of Jos\u00e9 Miguel Suescun, a repentant Etarra, who said he sheltered Anboto and Kantauri in his house in1985 but knew them only as 'Andr\u00e9s' and 'Angelines'. Although Suescun is accused of giving the pair information leading to the murder of a Basque policeman, he insists they issued no orders and discussed no hits but chatted about football. After the killing, Suescun shooed them out: 'I had an intuition they were not clean'. </p> <p>Anboto is the only female member of Eta's executive committee, according to police sources quoted in the Spanish media. But a police source said: 'There have always been women involved with Eta. Many women have been detained.' </p> <p>One of the 20 people arrested in Spain two weeks ago, accused of running Eta's strategic and logistical apparatus, was Anne Lizarralde, former spokeswoman of Jarrai, the Basque youth group. </p> <p>Ten days ago a woman walked up to a retired politician standing outside his home in San Sebasti\u00e1n and shot him once in the face as his wife unpacked the car. The woman, who fled after firing the shot which destroyed Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Recalde's face but did not kill him, is believed to be an Etarra, avenging a police operation to arrest 20 alleged Eta supporters in Spain. </p> <p>Last Thursday there was no mistake. Two men walked up to Jos\u00e9 Luis Ruiz Casado, town councillor for the Popular Party in Sant Adria de Besos, a suburb of Barcelona, and shot him twice, fatally. A woman waiting in a white Renault 19 drove them to safety; the car was found, ablaze, a few minutes later. </p> <p>It was the first Eta murder in Catalonia for six years, though Barcelona was the site of its bloodiest attack, the bombing of Hipercor supermarket that killed 21 and wounded 29. Josefina Mercedes Ernaga and a man were convicted of the attack and sentenced to 1,588 years in prison for 'coldness of spirit'. </p> <p>But Hipercor might have been dwarfed by the so-called 'Caravan of Death', a convoy including two vans loaded with more than a tonne of explosives, found by police before it reached its supposed destination: Madrid, the week before Christmas 1999. Police claim Anboto provided material and instructions to the would-be bombers, who reportedly included a woman named Alicia S\u00e1ez de la Cuesta. They also accuse Anboto of ordering an assassination attempt against King Juan Carlos when he opened the Guggenheim Museum in 1997; a policeman was killed in the operation. </p> <p>Iparragirre's promotion bodes ill for future negotiations, since she is described as a hardliner opposed to the truce called by the old troika of Grac\u00eda Arregi, Kantauri, and Miguel Albizu, or Mikel Antza, who heads Eta's political apparatus and remains in the new triumvirate. Police expect its third member to be Francisco Javier Garc\u00eda Gaztelu, or Txapote, another hardline ally of Iparragirre. </p> <p>In 1987 she supposedly fled to France, returning to Spain in the 1990s as a member of the Madrid commando, which has had several high-profile female members, including Bel\u00e9n Gonzalea Penalva, known as 'Carmen', and Rosario Delgado Iriondo. </p> <p>Anboto is accused of participating in several bombings in Madrid, including one that killed seven people. 'The Tigress', Mar\u00eda Idoia L\u00f3pez Riano, was apparently sacked from the Madrid commando in 1986 for indiscipline, but arrested in 1994 accused of participating in 23 killings. </p> <p>In 1999, during the truce, Carmen and Mikel Antza held talks with the government, but 'Carmen', suspected in at least four killings, was arrested in France a few months later. Rosario Del gado, 42, was also arrested last weekend, accused of 16 murders and of making false documents. </p> <p>She denied all the murder charges against her, but said: 'I don't regret anything, I would do it all again.'</p>",
  "What is it about Slobodan Milosevic and twins? <p>Look carefully at the photographs of Milosevic supporters and it seems he has a particular appeal for identical twins who also like to dress exactly the same. A man in a crisp white shirt with a shock of white hair on the left of a Milosevic election rally; the same man with white hair on the right of the crowd. </p> <p>During an open air rally in one of his strongholds in Montenegro he had identical twins in the front row. A square-jawed man with grey hair and on the other side of the picture - his twin; a man with a moustache beside him and, on the other side of the picture, his twin, same moustache, same leather jacket. </p> <p>President Milosevic of Serbia, the 59-year-old leader of the former Yugoslavia and indicted war criminal, is on the ropes. After 13 years leading Serbia through four wars, in which ten of thousands of people died, and massive inflation, when it took a wad of banknotes as heavy as a brick to buy a pair of jeans, he could lose today's presidential election by as much as 300,000 votes. </p> <p>He is expected to lose despite widespread predictions that he will steal at least half a million votes in parts of the country where the opposition have no power, such as Kosovo and Montenegro. </p> <p>Whatever the outcome, the opposition have called people on to the streets of Belgrade at 9pm today to declare victory - insisting that, despite the expected fraud, they will have won a moral victory. </p> <p>Last week, as the election drew closer, Milosevic and his party began resorting to more desperate measure including sticking photographs together on the front of pro-Milosevic newspapers to make it look like he had more support at rallies. A Reuters journalist estimated that 15,000 turned out to see him at his last major rally on Wednesday - Milosevic claimed that there were more than 100,000. </p> <p>At a rally later that night in Novi Belgrade's new stadium, supporters were brought in from all over Serbia to boost numbers. </p> <p>There was 'election silence' in Belgrade yesterday. Tradition dictates that for 48 hours before every Yugoslav election the TV, radio and election pundits fall silent as the people ponder their future. </p> <p>When and if the opposition wins in Serbia, 40-year-old Mira Yovanovic will consider trying again for the baby she aborted two weeks ago. She is sitting in her 8th floor apartment and says that when the polls open she will be there to vote and then she will be on the streets. 'I really wanted that baby but we decided not to go through with it. It is impossible, the whole health system has collapsed. Even two weeks ago it didn't look like the opposition could win - now we can win if Milosevic goes. The first thing I will do, if I can, is make a new baby for a new Yugoslavia.' </p> <p>There is still strong support for Milosevic among the old who treasure their right to vote and will come out in their thousands in support of him. They are the Communist generation, trusting faithfully in the wisdom of state television. People like Zoran Pantic, 60, who lives in the town of Vrsac close to the Romania border. His blue budgie squawks continuously in the sitting room of a small ground-floor flat as he repeats the mantra of TV Serbia which has been controlled by Milosevic since 1989. 'The Americans want to make us their slave. Turn us into a colony. That's why they told Nato to bomb us. When will they stop oppressing us with sanctions. Milosevic is rebuilding our country but what can a man do in an empty kitchen.' </p> <p>Gordana Petrovic, a 35-year-old geologist, said: 'Our biggest fear is that even if we do win he will not allow our victory. I am afraid of the police but I will go out on to the streets and there will be hundreds of thousands of us all around the country. It is one last chance to get rid of him.' </p> <p>On Wednesday night the opposition managed to bring at least 150,000 people on to the streets of Belgrade in what was seen as a dry run for tomorrow night. </p> <p>'We think there is a strong possibility that he will put the police on the streets - but nobody is sure how he will react. We don't think it is possible for his police to control the hundreds of thousands of people that will come out all over the country,' said Ivan Kocis, a former airforce pilot who is working with the opposition to try and prevent election fraud. </p> <p>Milosevic has around 120,000 police at his disposal. 'The police force is the only employer in Serbia that is taking on new workers,' according to Jovan Dulovic, a Belgrade journalist who has specialised in police and military affairs for more than 20 years. 'All police leave has been cancelled for September. There is no sign of any mobilisation but they are ready to go with a couple of hours' notice. They will be brought in from outside Belgrade to control the people there. Local police are not used in their home town.' </p> <p>The police force also includes the Special Intervention Brigade, some 30,000 men, many of them former volunteers and paramilitaries in the Bosnia and Croatian wars. 'These are tough guys, athletes who do weights and the cream of the force as well as former paramilitaries.' </p> <p>On a grey, wet weekend in Belgrade, the coffee shops on Republica Square were half empty. A couple in Mirijevo were buying in beer and mineral water. 'I need only beer and fish - I have everything else in the house. Maybe we are paranoid but we want to be prepared.' </p> <p>In the election, a virtually unknown candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, a 56-year-old lawyer with 19 opposition parties behind him, could win by as little as 300,000 votes. </p> <p>Last time Serbia voted against Milosevic was in the winter of 1996. Then, he refused to accept the defeat of his party in the local election and the people marched against him for three months. At the height of the protests there were 300,000 people on the streets of Belgrade. They failed when a fractured opposition did a deal and went into government. This time no deals are possible. </p> <p>The opposition is also better prepared to fight election fraud. 'This time we are organising for our food and drinks to be brought in from outside, prepared by our members. In 1997 our people were in the toilets for two hours with diarrhoea and couldn't see the ballot boxes being stuffed with votes for him,' says Kocis. </p> <p>'We will also be on the lookout for people buying votes at the gates of the polling stations. Last time people were being given deutschmarks and ballot papers that had already been marked for him. They would go inside and vote and then come back out and hand over their empty ballot paper.' </p> <p>Among the people carrying the water and food to the election polls and to the opposition workers will be Yovanovic. 'I joined the Communist party at 16 and left it at 17. I swore I'd never join another party in my life, but now I have to fight for my freedom.'</p>",
  "A french author has caused a storm of controversy in India by advocating reunification with Pakistan. His book has been denounced by Muslim clergy for its unsympathetic portrait of Islam. <p>Paris-born Fran\u00e7ois Gautier, who has lived in India for 29 years, is a political analyst for Le Figaro, the right-wing daily. He defends Indian nationalism and is a natural ally of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who has praised his work. </p> <p>Gautier has attacked all Indian institutions: caste, religion and politicians. He dismisses Sonia Gandhi, wife of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, as a colonial ploy to sap Indian confidence. 'She is white,' he says. 'Her colour is associated by Indians with purity and a superior culture.' </p> <p>But his favourite targets are India's Muslims, who comprise 12 per cent of the national population. In his latest book, Rewriting Indian History, he says: 'The massacres perpetuated by Muslims in India are unparalleled in history, bigger than the Holocaust of the Jews.' Islam, he says, is an autocratic religion - an exercise in militancy that seeks the eradication of other faiths. </p> <p>Gautier is equally immovable on his analysis of the situation in Kashmir. He says: 'If, to retain the Falkland Islands, thousands of miles away from Great Britain, the English fought a war and killed innocent Argentinians in the process, if the United States can invade Panama because it feels its interests are threatened there, if France battles to keep Corsica in its fold, an island which could as well belong to Italy, why should not India retain what has been hers for 5,000 years?' </p> <p>His work has many detractors - not least among academics. 'We're enlightened to the point where this book won't be subject to public burning,' says Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, vice-president of the Muslim Law Board, based in Delhi. 'But as a right-wing tract, this book could prove rather damaging to the status of Muslims in India. Politics is taken very seriously here, from the chattering classes right through to the Indian \u00e9lite. Muslims have, in recent years, become a common enemy, what with mosque burnings. For Gautier, they're an easy target.' </p> <p>Gautier defends his work as the writings of an intellectual unburdened by the careerism that is the standard in Indian politics. He seems undeterred by the occasional threat to his personal security, travelling widely throughout the country and claiming to capture the pulse of popular thinking. His work is particularly harsh towards liberalism; he reckons Indian independence to have been a failure. 'Pakistanis should acknowledge their inherent Indian-ness,' he says. 'Reunification should be seriously considered by the region.' </p> <p>This seems an unlikely prospect; both countries have waged war three times since independence in 1947.</p>",
  "An email has arrived from Belgrade. 'We're all in election fever, hope and horror at the same time. Wish us luck!' <p>No amount of analysis, speculation and informed guesswork can sum up better the mood in Serbia. Today the country is at the crossroads; tomorrow blood may be running in the streets of Belgrade. Thousands could be cheering the fall of President Slobodan Milosevic, or Serbs will wake, resigned to four more years of isolation, sanctions and poverty. </p> <p>According to Braca Grubacic, one of Belgrade's sharpest political analysts, most Serbs believe the elections are 'most likely the last chance for a peaceful replacement of the government, which could put Serbia back on a normal track and help it join the international community'. </p> <p>Grubacic says that if Milosevic wins the presidential elections - by fair means or foul - 'most ordinary Serbs believe the future of Serbia will be like Cuba's. Serbia will be a dead country waiting for the natural death of its dictator, and living the slow life of a tourist haven out of season'. </p> <p>The extraordinary thing about the polls is that no one has any clear idea what will happen. What is likely, though, is that as results come in tonight Serbia will be plunged into political crisis - or worse. </p> <p>Judging by the opinion polls, Milosevic, once dubbed the Butcher of the Balkans, is political history. But the polls may be unreliable and, more to the point, Milosevic has no intention of relinquishing power. Still, it seems extremely unlikely that he can win outright victory, which would require more than 50 per cent of the ballots cast, or at least 2.5 million votes. </p> <p>Zarko Korac, leader of one of the 18 parties now united behind opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica, says: 'They [meaning Milosevic's Socialists and his wife Mira Markovic's Yugoslav United Left party] are in trouble. The question is, can they steal enough votes in an acceptable way? We don't think so.' Yet huge dangers loom, says Korac, a psychology professor at Belgrade University. As the results come in, he along with all the other opposition leaders will gather at their headquarters building. </p> <p>While opposition leaders will be indoors, they want their supporters to be outside. In Belgrade and several other big cities, giant screens will be set up by the opposition. From their point of view, the more people who are on the streets, the better. They are convinced that Milosevic intends to declare victory in the first round, to avoid a second round in two weeks, if he fails the 50 per cent hurdle. </p> <p>If then there are enough people on the streets, Milosevic may not want to risk a major clash, pitting police against vast crowds. At this point there is a real risk of bloodshed. If the situation spirals out of control, the army, led by General Nebojsa Pavkovic, may declare that the opposition leaders have attempted to launch a coup d'\u00e9tat, and arrest them. If however, it is raining heavily, too few people are out, or there is confusion about the results, any protests may quickly fizzle out. </p> <p>Although the opposition do look set to do well, there are, of course, many who still believe in Milosevic. In control of all the main media outlets, the President will have convinced many that the election is really a referendum between himself and Nato. A sign that Milosevic is worried, however, is his language. Over the last few years it has been somewhat restrained, perhaps an attempt to clothe himself in presidential dignity. Not any more. At a rally last Wednesday, Milosevic roared that the opposition leaders were a menagerie of 'rabbits, dogs and hyenas' whose one and only wish was to make 'a coiffed poodle out of their giant nation, by which the foreign master, when bored, can be entertained'. </p> <p>So everything now hangs not just on the vote, but on the reactions of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Serbs tonight and tomorrow. What happens if the regime and the opposition both claim victory? What happens if there are disputes over the way the votes are being counted? Nobody knows. </p> <p>All we know for certain is that tonight, Serbia is on the edge of the abyss. </p> <p>Tim Judah is the author of 'The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia'</p>",
  "<p>Lessons of the fuel crisis, number one: New Labour knows little about business (beyond how to milk it for donations). There was something almost poignant about the Government's sudden realisation that the oil companies were not able to order 'their' tanker drivers to run the blockades. </p> <p>Ministers clearly did not know that big companies no longer run anything other than their core businesses - that everything else is outsourced to independent contractors, such as the hauliers who transport fuel for the oil majors and who were understandably sympathetic to their peers at the gates. </p> <p>Given that outsourcing has long been one of the Ten Commandments of successful business, this makes one wonder where Messrs Blair and Straw have been all these years. The answer, I suppose, is that they have been full-time politicians. The same goes for their Cabinet colleagues. The result is government by a bunch of jokers who have never run anything bigger than a whelk stall but are now trying to run the country. </p> <p>And it shows. Readers of this column will be wearily familiar with the saga of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill, a crazy statute railroaded through Parliament on the grounds that it had to become law by 2 October, the day that the Human Rights Act comes into force. </p> <p>The ostensible purpose of the RIP Bill was to sweep all the surveillance practices of Her Majesty's Government under the figleaf of legality required by the European Convention on Human Rights. (Cue hollow laughter.) In practice, one of its main effects will be to drive e-commerce firms from the UK, because they do not like the idea of having their encryption keys open to seizure by the goons of the Home Office. This consequence, needless to say, never crossed Jack Straw's mind while the Bill was in preparation. </p> <p>Straw had much bigger fish to fry than online traders, namely the various criminals, subversives, extremists and anarchists who allegedly use the net for their nefarious purposes. The RIP Act contains some sweeping powers for dealing with these pests, and Home Office Ministers retained them in the teeth of opposition from the civil liberties lobby during the Bill's passage through the Lords. </p> <p>Now, they are about to reap the first benefits of their persistence. The ragbag Poujadistic alliance of farmers and truckers which recently brought the country to its knees has grandly given the Government 60 days to rethink its policy on fuel duties. The protesters have promised to revisit mayhem upon us if the Government does not do their bidding. The tabloid press eggs them on with excited stories about how this kind of popular uprising is unstoppable because it is decentralised and coordinated via mobile telephony and the internet. </p> <p>All of which makes Straw smile that sinister smile of his. Clearly the folks who are glibly promising to blockade fuel depots 50 days hence are not familiar with the terms of the RIP Act, which expressly allows the Home Secretary or his agents to intercept email under a number of circumstances. One such is if he believes the UK's economic well-being is threatened. </p> <p>You don't have to be a lawyer of Cherie Booth's stature to spot that fuel blockages have precisely that effect, so Straw will have no difficulty in establishing that he is entitled to snoop on protesters' email traffic to his heart's content. And if they try to foil him by encrypting their messages, they will discover that Straw has thought of that too, for the Act allows him to demand plaintext versions or decryption keys under threat of two years' imprisonment. </p> <p>The Home Office men always thought the Act would come in handy some day. They were right. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:John.Naughton@observer.co.uk\">John.Naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A truly curious letter appeared in the New York Times two years ago headed, 'It's time to repay America', by one Tony Blair. In it, he thanked Bill Clinton and the whole of the US for introducing him to the pleasures of governing the American Way. That, he wrote, meant 'results, not theology... free from preconceptions and bureaucratic wrangling... Government should not hinder the logic of the market!' </p> <p>As an American, I should have been flattered, but this outburst of affection was a wee bit embarrassing, like getting a Valentine dipped in perfume from an office mate. </p> <p>And I suspected that, as the poets say, beneath the greatest love is a hurricane of hate. So what so bugs Tony that he would write this billet-doux to 270 million foreigners? The PM's acrid reaction to the petrol revolt gives a glimpse of his dark secret: in his heart, Tony Blair hates Britain. </p> <p>This Prime Minister despises his storybook countryside and its grumbling farmers with their two little pigs and their tiny fields edged with dry stone. He cringes at the little bell ringing over the door of the village post office - so quaint and so maddeningly inefficient. He cannot fathom a nation that weeps over How Green was my Valley and moans when he shuts those filthy coal pits. </p> <p>He is frustrated to tears by fossilised trade unions which chain workers to dead industries, rather than building new ones, and by the rabid blue-hairs who demand he keep the Queen's nose on the coinage. Blair dreams of birthing the Entrepreneurial State. Instead, he finds himself caretaker of a museum of nineteenth-century glories made somnolent by easy welfare and low ambitions. </p> <p>Blair gazes across the water with almost erotic envy at Bill Clinton, chairman of the board of America Inc. This week, the once-arrogant now-jittery New Labour faithful creep towards their Brighton party conference to seek reassurance from above. It is important to understand how Blair's pathological imitation of Clinton is, in fact, pathetically off the mark. In misunderstanding the source of Clinton's - and now Gore's - political magic, Blair jeopardises his party's majority, and his nation's industry. </p> <p>Blair looks for the secrets to Clinton's economic and political success in all the wrong places. This struck me forcefully last week when I found myself in possession of a World Bank document so confidential even the bank's board has yet to see it: the latest Country Policy and Institutional Assessment, its internal 'school report' for less developed countries. The Bank rates each nation from one to six for their adherence to the neo-liberal ideals of the Bank, the International Monetary Fund and allied agencies. </p> <p>Bolivia, which deployed tanks and tear gas to quell a public revolt over water price hikes, gets an admirable two and a pat on the head. But Haiti, which is resisting demands to sell off its national infrastructure, gets a dunce's six, and is sent to bed without supper or access to capital markets. </p> <p>Highest marks go to nations committed to the five horsemen of the Washington Consensus: privatisation of public services, budget austerity, trade liberalisation, deregulation of industry, and labour market 'flexibility'. </p> <p>One gets the impression that Blair wants to be teachers' pet, to score straight ones in these tests, and bring back from Washington the Promethean fire that will transform Britain's socio-economic soul and drag it, kicking and screaming, into the third millennium. </p> <p>US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told a London audience last December: 'With a flexible labour force, you too can replicate America's prosperity!' The Prime Minister bit his lip with jealousy. By 'flexibility', Summers means what the World Bank calls 'non-wage employment costs' - from working week limitations to pension guarantees - which hinder businesses' ability to use employees as they would any other commodity. </p> <p>Blair doesn't understand that Summers' 'flexible labour force' prescription is a con. In 1993, I ran into David Lipton, then Summers' deputy, at a party celebrating Clinton's signing of a new maternity leave law. Lipton had just returned from Eastern Europe, where he had told Poland's President to end maternity leave benefits. </p> <p>Did he note any hypocrisy? He was puzzled. Flexible (read 'unprotected') employment is for them - for the Polands and Bolivias - to serve our interests. It could not possibly apply to the US. If Blair were savvy, he'd note that while Clinton's minions sell modernisation snake oil through World Bank assessments and Third Way seminars, the President sells American voters protection from the risks of the new economy. </p> <p>Clinton - and his heir apparent, Al Gore - are proud to stand as bulwarks against the privatisation of the US social security system. They campaign on commitments to spend trillions on investment in public services, rather than cutting taxes, and they crow over new controls on employment and new restrictions on 'big tobacco, big drug companies and big polluters', to use Gore's phrase. </p> <p>By contrast Blair, in his snarling response to the petrol tax protesters, showed his commitment to 'the logic of the marketplace'. How unClintonesque. </p> <p>Blair should have noted how, during the November uprising in Seattle, even when ruckus-makers vandalised the President's favourite eatery, McDonald's, Clinton resisted the urge to go into Blairish scold mode. He praised the honourable intentions of the protesters, felt their pain and, to the horror of the UK contingent, effectively ended the World Trade Organisation meeting. </p> <p>Clinton is not above abusing Blair's naive desire to boost US corporate interests. For example, internal US Department of Commerce memos state that in 1997, Clinton's commerce secretary, William Daley, leaned on Margaret Beckett, Blair's first Trade and Industry Secretary, to grant US energy companies waivers to Labour's moratorium on building new gas-fired power plants. Daley's notes say Blair overruled Beckett and 'watered down the moratorium' to help US investors. </p> <p>This effectively sealed the fate of Britain's coal mines (and, I note, left the nation with no alternative energy source to counterbalance the current oil price rise). Given such consequences, why did he hop like a bunny to Clinton's bidding? </p> <p>For the answer, we must step back for a wider view. The US power companies that cashed in on Blair's policy exemption were merely the first of a battalion of adventuring American operators that wiped their feet on the golden doormat at Number 10. </p> <p>Wal-Mart swallowed Asda after its executives held an extraordinary closed meeting with the PM himself. Special privileges were extended to Wackenhut, the private prisons corporation, to Columbia private hospitals, to Monsanto, and to GTech, the bribe-tainted lottery operator. And today, the Government is hoping to lure in Edison, the schools privatisation company. </p> <p>Yet in the US, these companies are not fondly treated. Blair seems unaware that Edison is withering under Gore's attacks on privatisation. The Clinton administration has ground down Columbia with investigations and new regulations. Wackenhut has yet to recover from criminal investigations. No matter: to Blair they are a thrusting American stud pool which will breed with the mangy local stock. If the Wal-Mart dragon torches the high street, that too serves the higher purpose of economic Darwinism. </p> <p>Clinton is a class warrior. His commerce department's calls to Beckett indicate that, when push comes to shove, he will do the bidding of corporate America. Gore blasts the drug companies in paid political adverts, then plays their poodle to yap at African nations that dare to demand cheap Aids drugs. </p> <p>Gore, but not Blair, has learnt from Clinton how to play it both ways: working class hero and Wall Street's friend. Clinton's not bothered by cumbersome convictions or hifalutin theories. </p> <p>But Blair is a believer. He has none of Clinton's cynical cool. The PM has been wrongly tagged a philosophically empty bionic election machine, a box of poll-driven gears with a smile painted on the front. In fact, Blair may be the most idealistic, principled leader in the non-Moslem world, committed fanatically to the transformation of his nation's socio-economic soul. And that's frightening. </p> <p>But Britain is not Bolivia - yet. Blair cannot understand that the Washington jabber about flexible workforces and globalisation is a gloss for the projection of American commercial powers and privileges. Its aim is to make weaker nations' assets and labour accessible, cheap and compliant to US investors. </p> <p>Yet Blair sincerely believes that if he turns over Britain's high streets to Wal-Mart, its fields to Monsanto and its schools to Edison, they will sprinkle American commercial know-how over his laggardly island and - presto! - enterprise will take off. </p> <p>How profitable for American and local capital.

  "Now we know with what contempt your Leader writer (mob), Andrew Rawnsley (Sierra man), Jonathon Porritt (insufferable arrogance) and sundry pundits and politicians think of the general public (Comment, last week). Most of us, including Volvo Estate and 4WD man, support the protesters. <p>Those opposed to the protest hardly notice the price of energy and are happy not to pay more than a marginal 40 per cent income tax or 20 per cent company tax when their accountants can't avoid it. </p> <p>So far as global warming is concerned, we are not as stupid as you presume. As any teacher will tell you, you do not get cooperation by beating with sticks or insults, even with carrots added. High energy costs impinge on the poor more than the rich, so when the next protest starts I, and I trust my fellow insultees, will be there on the picket lines with our shell suits and Zimmer frames. <br><b> C.G. Sinclair</b><br> Manchester </p> <p>\u0095 Well said, Jonathon Porritt. Now all we need is a public rebuff of the misguided, self-righteous protesters. </p> <p>Does it not occur to the protesters that the silent acceptance of the inconvenience and costs arising from their actions is no surer sign of support than the apathy which most of us have previously been accepting the Government's policies? <br> <b> Ivan White </b> <br>Bedford </p> <p>\u0095 There is more than a whiff of paranoia in Margaret Beckett's reaction to the oil blockaders. The protesters looked and talked like ordinary people, and didn't 96 per cent of the public support them? </p> <p>To regard ordinary people as 'the enemy' (the same ordinary people who gave Blair his landslide victory in 1997) is an anti-democratic, almost Stalinist reaction by New Labour. Are these ordinary people now to be 'crushed', rather than their legitimate grievances on fuel tax listened to? <br><b> Rosemary Brian </b> <br>Croyde, Devon </p> <p>\u0095 After all that has been written about the 'petrol crisis', have other readers begun to have an uneasy feeling that there has been a slightly sinister political undertone to the whole affair? </p> <p>We are told that it was a 'totally spontaneous' event by ordinary people - that being the case, how was it that those described as 'leaders' outside the various depots all seemed to know each other and be able to communicate instantly by mobile phone? </p> <p>And why did the name 'Countryside Alliance' keep cropping up; I thought that organisation was only interested in keeping foxhunting alive and our rural species of songbirds dead? <br><b> Leslie Fraser-Mitchell </b> <br>Swaffham, Norfolk </p> <p>\u0095 The crisis highlights the folly and injustice of relying too much on indirect taxation as a source of revenue, because this takes a larger proportion of poor people's income than rich people's. </p> <p>Progressive income tax, where those who are wealthy contribute at a higher rate to society's needs than those who are not well off, is the most equitable method. </p> <p>I think Tony Blair's greatest mistake was made before the election when he promised not to raise income tax, even on the highest earners. <br><b> Christine Speirs </b> <br>Cambridge</p> <p>\u0095 During the miners' and steelworkers' strikes, many motor transport drivers betrayed their fellow workers by blacklegging, and then boasting on TV how much money they made. </p> <p>As one that stood on the steelworkers' picket, I felt they were below contempt. It is a fallacy to say they did not break the law in the petrol blockade. Obstruction and more than six pickets are offences, but I did not see much enthusiasm on the part of the police to do anything about it. </p> <p>While I feel that petrol prices are too high, I voted for a government to deal with economic matters, not a bunch of farmers and truck drivers. <br><b> F.R. Evans</b> <br>Chichester, W.

  "Sex, oil, money, family rivalry and plastic surgery: the battle over the fortune left by the late Texas oilman J. Howard Marshall II enters court this week with all the elements of a Dallas-style soap opera. <p>Former Playboy centrefold Anna Nicole Smith, 32, who became the octogenarian's third wife 14 months before his death in 1995 , is fighting Marshall's two sons, both in their sixties, over an estate valued at up to $1.2 billion by Forbes magazine. </p> <p>To make matters worse, the sons are not even on the same side. </p> <p>Both the older son, J. Howard Marshall III, who was allegedly disinherited over a business dispute, and Anna Nicole, accuse the favoured son and sole beneficiary of the fortune, Pierce Marshall, of conniving them out of their fair share. Pierce Marshall says the two have received plenty of money already and he is just honouring his father's will. </p> <p>While the case is not likely to set any legal precedents, it will certainly offer a high profile look at an age-old quandary: Are the romantic interests of a young woman and a wheelchair-bound billionaire founded in love or the scent of cold cash? </p> <p>The outcome of the case is likely to depend on whom jurors like better: the younger son who wants to keep all, the older son who once threatened to undermine his father's rags-to-riches achievement, or the sexy young widow who claims that she loved a rich old man. </p> <p>Anna Nicole and the bil lionaire met in 1991 when Marshall's chauffeur took him to a topless club to cheer him up, according to court documents. At the time, the statuesque blonde was a single mother working as a dancer to support herself and her young son. </p> <p> Marshall began lavishing gifts on her and, she says, proposing marriage. Anna Nicole says she put Marshall's proposals off for three years while he helped her rise from topless dancer to model for Guess? jeans and a career in films including Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult . </p> <p>When the couple finally married he came down the aisle in his wheelchair and his bride wore an elaborate, deeply cut wedding gown that she later wore at his funeral. </p> <p>More than a dozen lawyers are set to argue the case and the US media have descended on Judge Mike Wood's Houston courtroom in a case that could last months. </p> <p>'He loved me, and I loved him. He promised me half of everything,' Anna Nicole said, 'He wanted to make me happy,' she told a Los Angeles judge last year. 'My wish was his command.'</p>",
  "A sudden rise in the number of illegal female circumcisions being carried out in Britain has raised alarm and could lead to a review of current legislation. <p>The Observer has learnt that an all-party parliamentary group looking into the practice will recommend a tightening of the law. In particular, it wants to close a legal loophole that allows girls to be sent abroad for circumcision. The report will also recommend that a national survey should be carried out to determine the scale of the problem and seek more government funding for projects to combat the practice. </p> <p>Researchers believe more than 3,000 young girls in Britain may be being mutilated each year, a sharp increase resulting from a recent influx of refugees from the Horn of Africa, where female circumcision is commonplace. </p> <p>Though most girls are sent abroad, the crude operations are increasingly performed at home, often during school holidays to give the children time to recover and escape the notice of teachers. </p> <p>The illegality of the procedure means researchers and activists meet a wall of silence in the refugee communities. 'Nobody will ever tell you they sent their children abroad for circumcision, but it is known that they do do it,' said Zeinab Mohamed, who has studied the Somali community in Manchester. </p> <p>The people who carry out the operations are nearly always members of the refugee communities and usually doctors, nurses or midwives. No one has ever been prosecuted in Britain and campaigners and health workers usually only hear of rumours of their actions. Recently a Somali girl in Southall, west London, tipped off social services about nurses coming to circumcise her younger sister. But when the news leaked out the nurses disappeared. </p> <p>Circumcision, which varies in severity from cutting the clitoris to removing the labia and sewing up the vagina with thorns, occurs across the Horn of Africa. Last year alone, the number of asylum applications from Somalia, where virtually all young girls are severely mutilated during circumcisions, topped 7,400, compared with 1,780 in 1996. </p> <p>However, fighting circumcision is difficult. The tradition is entrenched and mothers face enormous pressure from family and friends to have daughters circumcised. If they do not they face being ostracised or divorced. </p> <p>The depth of belief in the practice is revealed in answers to an anonymous survey being conducted among Horn of Africa refugees living in London. The main protagonists behind the circumcisions are frequently elderly women, usually grandmothers.</p>",
  "As real estate deals go, it is hardly major league: a string of tiny, uninhabited dots of land on the market for offers above \u00a375,000. But the sale of Aber, Torrinch and Creinch, three of Loch Lomond's most beautiful islands, has provoked a far bigger row than either their size or asking price would seem to warrant. <p>The islands have gone on the open market amid grave concern from local conservationists that by selling them to the highest bidder, their unique, unspoilt character may be jeopardised. </p> <p>To the fury of locals, the estate agent handling the sale, the Edinburgh office of FPD Savills, is marketing the islands as a haven for city dwellers looking for a place to act out their own version of the BBC television series Castaway 2000 . </p> <p>In the wake of the rows over the high-profile sales of Ben Nevis and the Black Cuillin mountain range on Skye, campaigners are now calling on Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the National Trust for Scotland to step in and save a smaller but equally significant slice of landscape for the nation. </p> <p>There is a legend of Loch Lomond that its islands float on the surface, and the quality of the light playing on the water is such that Aber, Torrinch and Creinch never appear to be in the same position twice. They are regarded as pristine, bite-size examples of how Scotland's scenery may have developed without the interference of man. </p> <p>The islands are covered in native tree and plant species such as oak, alder and Scots pine, all untouched by the encroachment of civilisation. A few capercaillies enjoy the run of the thick undergrowth without fear of being disturbed, unlike those on the mainland which are battling for survival as their natural habitats disappear. </p> <p>In spring, Creinch - Island of the Trees - is carpeted with wild garlic, hyacinths and wood anemones, while the Aber, a smudge of land that is submerged for most of the year, is an important roosting place for many migratory birds. Torrinch, the largest and most dramatic of the islands at 19 acres, and Creinch are geologically important. They form part of a submerged ridge that marks the fault line in the continental shelf dividing the Highlands from lowland Scotland. </p> <p>The sale is born out of tragedy. Under Crown charter, the islands have been in the Buchanan family estate since 1708 and their future should have been secure. The last owner, Lady Leith-Buchanan, had struggled to keep the estate afloat but she was determined to protect the islands, so she entered a management agreement with SNH 13 years ago to bring them under the Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. </p> <p>But last year 95-year-old Lady Leith-Buchanan was killed in a fire which swept through her cottage in Gartocharn. The trustees of her estate are now being forced to sell the islands to settle her debts, pay off death duties and to raise money for the care of her daughter, Helen, 50, who is severely disabled by Parkinson's disease. Jock Scott-Park, one of the trustees, said: 'We are doing this with very deep regret. We have simply been left with no choice but to sell.' </p> <p>The islands are designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest and are protected under European legislation as Special Areas of Conservation. But though the management agreement with SNH still has 12 years to run, local campaigners fear that unless the new owner is dedicated to the islands' preservation, there is no way of guaranteeing their future beyond then. </p> <p>They are also concerned that the advent of the new Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park will do more to confuse their status than to safeguard it. The legislation for the park does not give conservation top priority, instead making it only one of four competing aims. </p> <p>Hannah Stirling, co-founder and president of the Friends of Loch Lomond group, which is leading the campaign, said: 'We understand completely why the sale has to take place but it is a tragedy that such an important piece of Scotland's natural heritage can be sold off to highest bidder.' </p> <p>She is furious that Savills is trying to attract buyers on the back of the Castaway 2000 series. Issuing an appeal to 'would-be castaways', the agent's promotional material states: 'With the return of Castaway 2000 ... the focus of TV viewers may well switch from the urban environment of Big Brother and islands will be back in the news. Now comes your chance to acquire your very own island or islands and play at castaway to your heart's content.' </p> <p>'I am absolutely disgusted by Savills,' Stirling said. 'This is no way to advertise something so precious as these islands.' </p> <p>SNH would consider giving support, including financial help, to any organisation, such as the Friends, which wanted to buy the islands for conservation purposes. But spokesman George Anderson said: 'We shouldn't become obsessed by the idea that we have to own every important piece of land. Ownership matters less to us than what happens with the islands.' </p> <p>Neil Kay, the selling agent for Savills which is also handling the Cuillins sale, said: 'We see it as very much conservation-minded people who might be interested in this sale. There is no possibility of ever building on these islands. While we have to look after the interests of our clients, if someone like the Friends of Loch Lomond could make the purchase, we would be extremely happy.' </p> <p>But Hannah Stirling warned: 'Even if the new owners cut down just one ancient tree, it can never be put back and the islands will be scarred forever.'</p>",
  "<b>Greg Marinovich:</b> I grew up in a leafy suburb of Johannesburg. I was intellectually opposed to apartheid, and in 1990 I started venturing into black Soweto, armed with nothing but a couple of obsolete cameras. I soon formed a special bond with three other young photographers, Kevin Carter, Ken Oosterbroek and Joao Silva. They were also on a mission to cut through the spin doctoring and the lies. A newspaper called us the Bang-Bang Club, and the name stuck. <p> The end of the apartheid was a revolutionary time. A lot of people were being indiscriminately killed. We were on the brink of a civil war and I felt compelled to document whatever happened. The euphoria of Mandela's release in 1990 had been accompanied by a sustained campaign of brutal killings and terror, covertly planned, funded and executed by government security units, the police and hired gangs to spread terror in the townships. </p> <p> We'd go to these areas and be confronted with the reality of 'black South Africa'. We'd witness atrocities, massacres and assassinations. We worked on adrenaline, with the belief that we were making a difference. We relied on each other emotionally to carry us through. I was anti-social, quite suicidal and had great trouble in communicating. Watching someone being killed is mind-shattering. I often feared for my safety and was worried about being too scared to intervene. </p> <p> Kevin, who was the inspiration for the song 'Kevin Carter' by the Manic Street Preachers, committed suicide weeks after winning his Pulitzer Prize for a photograph of a child being stalked by a vulture in the Sudanese famine in 1993. Dealing with Kevin's suicide was tough. A year later, Ken was accidentally shot by an ANC gunman.</p> <p> Joao and I continued our work. He was tenacious and could be aggressive, but above all he was loyal. Once, we were in a small township when automatic fire broke out. Joao dragged me by my camera vest closer to the wall, seeking shelter next to the soldiers and out of their line of fire. Blood seeped from the gaping hole in my T-shirt, but he had saved my life. </p> <p> Writing a book together about us all, The Bang-Bang Club (\u00a317.99, Heinemann), has helped us come to terms with everything. We had failed hopelessly. The war we showed was black people killing black people 99 per cent of the time. There was a well-executed secret war. The truth, which we knew at the time but couldn't document, was that it was all being secretly funded by the white regime. </p> <p><b> Joao Silva:</b> I always knew I wanted to be a war photographer. I dropped out of school and studied photography at night classes. I met Greg in the Alexandra township in 1991 and we got on well. I worked on a local paper. One night I had to cover a Rotary Club's Christmas dinner and a toy machine gun fell out of my cracker. I felt this was an omen. The following week, I approached Reuters and persuaded them to let me submit pictures on spec. </p> <p> There was a lot of violence. We would team up for 'dawn patrols', waking to be in the townships by first light. Kevin and Greg won Pulitzer prizes for their photographs of 'human torches' and starving children. I often feared for my safety, but Greg was always a tremendous source of strength. Nothing makes you feel more alive than the moment you've come so close to death. </p> <p> Kevin was a larger-than-life figure who was prone to mood swings and nightmares. We felt anger and sadness when he committed suicide. Greg and I spent hours on the phone talking him out of it. Ken's death affected us more because it was violent. Without Kevin and Ken there wouldn't have been a Bang-Bang Club. We wish they were here to share the success of the book, but there wouldn't have been one if they hadn't died. It made the story sexy. </p> <p> In a way we're keeping their names alive, trying to tell their stories as best we can. We're not abnormal people. Those were abnormal times. Our pictures propagated what the apartheid government was trying to put across, which is that black people are savages and there's no way they can run a country. Here's the evidence. We fell into that.</p> <p>We formed a very special bond with the people in the townships. A British paper ran a picture of a person being hacked to death with the headline 'Mandela's henchmen take care of the opposition'. If put into context, it was a funeral of 40 massacred civilians, the anger was intense and there'd been a vengeance killing. Images were manipulated to prove a point. It was out of my control, not what I intended and was very frustrating. </p> <p> Writing the book was cathartic. We did a lot of talking, digging and probing. It helped us come to terms with friends dying. I now freelance for The New York Times and no longer feel the necessity to go from one war zone to the next. As for Greg, he's about to move to Germany, but we'll still be in touch as we're collaborating on a film script of the book. Our bond is stronger than family so we'll always be close.</p>",
  "With the rustle of dead leaves or the squelch of soggy ones beneath your feet, beyond the usual poetic autumnal symbolism of decline, death (approaching winter) and rebirth in spring, you will probably be aware by now of the physical and emotional challenges presented by seasonal change. <p>As well as stepping in and out of unnaturally heated buildings, cars, buses or trains - usually swaddled in too many layers while inside and too few while outside - your immune system must contend with rapid variations in temperature caused by the fluctuating changes in wind direction and pressure. </p> <p>When the wind blows from the west, warmed by the Gulf Stream, the air will be mild, and your energy will tend to be optimistic and abundant. When blowing from the north, the air becomes bone-penetratingly brisk, though usually clean-feeling and invigorating. When the wind blows from the east, however, it carries not only the bitter damp cold of Siberia, but also the pollution of all of Eastern Europe, including its radioactivity, collective frustrations and discontent. The East wind invades your system and blows a host of malevolent viruses through your channels. (The south wind generally takes to hanging around the Med for the autumn and winter months - a wind that knows how to blow in style - but not in our direction.) </p> <p>Autumn stretches your body's intelligence services to the limit, running first to the eastern rampart of the citadel, then to the north, then to the west, as randomly alternating winds produce sudden unexpected rises and falls in temperature. </p> <p>Your immune system (the intelligence service's executive arm) works best when you're happy. With less light and shorter days, unless you make a concerted effort to spend time outside, preferably each morning, it's unlikely you'll see much natural light, which can lead to a propensity for depression caused by light deficiency (SAD). </p> <p>According to Oriental medical philosophy, each of the four seasons (five if you count late summer), gives rise to potential problems in one of the five major organs. </p> <p>In autumn, it's the turn of the lungs. In practice, this means that when the winds of autumn come whistling through your meridians, the lung meridian is the most vulnerable. The wind stirs up internal dust or respiratory 'impurities', instigating coughs, colds and ear infections that will manifest a short while afterwards during the winter. </p> <p>Don't let yourself succumb to gloominess, however. Autumn is a time of exquisite beauty, every moment of which must be savoured in the lessening though brilliant silver light that only comes when the planet's tilt is on this particular angle. There is a melancholy grandeur in surrendering with dignity to oncoming winter's dark, cold grip. </p> <p>Take the challenge on as a warrior. Get up half an hour earlier than you have to. Stretch your body gently and, donning appropriate layers, go outside into the nearest available garden or park. Walk, run, swing your arms about, do t'ai chi if you know some (if not, consider taking lessons), kick up leaves like a child, and embrace the elements. Look at the vastness of the sky and feel grateful for being alive. </p> <p>Drink mullein tea to open your air passages and prevent respiratory blockages. Take homeopathic aconite if you feel a cold or sore throat threatening. Take tincture of propolis as a daily tonic for the lungs. Visit an acupuncturist for a seasonal immune-system boost. </p> <p>Finally, using the recently commenced school year as a metaphor for your life, apply yourself to studying or learning something new that will stretch you mentally, physically or both, to give you an alternative focus during the lengthening nights. Additionally, visualise the midday summer sun shining in your solar plexus at all times to increase feelings of positivity. Don't waste a minute feeling sorry for yourself, being blas\u00e9 or taking things for granted. Appreciate this autumn like never before. </p> <p><b> Dear Doctor, I am contacting you on behalf of my mother. She has been diagnosed as having IBS by her GP.

The fact that your father's lungs are reacting makes me wonder if this isn't linked to some emotional crisis, perhaps occuring after a profound loss, including mourning the passing of the years (ie later-life crisis) and that maybe a spot of counselling with someone compassionate/competent will also help. In addition it would help to try echinacea and multivitamins and mineral-plus-ginseng supplements to help boost immunity, as well as St John's wort to lift the spirits.</p> <p>\u0095 Barefoot Doctor is author of Handbook for the Urban Warrior and teaches Taoism, meditation, Chinese medicine and t'ai chi.

  "Patrick Cox has a very strict idea about design. Pick up one of his shoes and it's clear: the ergonomic shape and sturdy but refined structure. No-fuss modernity. One might expect a man with such perfectionist tendencies to live in a slick, whitewashed place with lots of stainless steel, bare floors and limestone. But Cox's elegant first-floor, 1860 flat in London W2 is more like Louis XIV's Versailles in miniature. Packed with lavish French period furniture, ornate marble busts, noble bronze statues, huge stucco wall hangings - it's his own petit French Empire. <p>The 37-year-old shoe designer (known to the world for creating the infamous Wannabe in 1993, while supplying stars and Sloanes alike with glamorous high heels) moved to the airy Notting Hill flat a couple of years after graduating from Cordwainers shoe college. That was back in 1988, seven years before Wannabe mania took over the world and changed his life for ever. </p> <p>He grew up in Canada and Africa, but it is almost impossible to tell from his home. Revelling in London club culture and determined to live beyond his means, Cox set about filling the place with French antiquities and designing every room himself. 'The place had to be exactly as I wanted it. I'm a complete control freak,' he shrieks, by way of explanation. 'I'm not good with other peoples opinions.' His first flat purchase was the huge chandelier that hangs in the centre of the dining room: 'I got that before I even bought a sofa. It was like me, my boyfriend and the chandelier.' </p> <p>Now Cox heads a \u00a325 million business, with more than 25 shops across the globe, A-list celebrity clientele, an extensive accessory line and a zesty new perfume called High. Needless to say, his two-bedroom pad is pretty spectacular these days. The hallway sets the tone. Painted a rich yolky yellow (John Oliver's Imperial Chinese yellow), it's a shrine to Napoleon with a huge portrait of the man himself, marble busts and a cluster of gilt mirrors. </p> <p>The front room is the kind of place you want to hang out and drink lots of coffee in and read for hours on end. It's decked out Empire style with Grand Tour bronze statues and giant church candles on every surface, a huge Louis XIV mirrored coffee table and a 20ft-high window framed with impressive gold brocade curtains (nabbed from an old stately home). The window is the one where Mr and Mrs Clarke sat for David Hockney for that painting - the house was originally owned by a close friend of Ossie Clarke's. The room is polished, elegant and traditional, and belies the fact that Cox himself is a notorious party animal. No hint of the wild designer with a passion for upbeat dance music and Donna Summer records - until you open an inconspicuous cupboard which holds an enormous television, a booming sound system, neat racks of dance CDs placed in military order. There are piles of art books - stacked so neatly it looks like someone has come in and measured the space either side of the books to ensure they are symmetrical. And a Buffy the Vampire Slayer triple video cassette. 'I just adore those American teen TV shows,' he squeals. 'That's the thing about me, I'm just this kid who never grew up.' </p> <p>His youthful mentality is concealed by a veneer of refinement and maturity. Yesterday, Cox tells me, he sat in this room watching TV for six hours, recovering from his perfume launch party (a star-studded do held at Harvey Nichols Fifth Floor bar.) 'I didn't even answer the telephone,' he boasts, as if to prove he's an excellent slob, while lounging elegantly on his favourite armchair (an enormous blue object he picked up from the Conran Shop in the mid-80s). It's hard to believe. Today he's dressed in slim-fitting maroon trousers, a chocolate-brown sweater, which skims his svelte physique, and a pair of his own square-toed tan slip-ons. The flat is impeccable. </p> <p>A little cupboard in the dining room houses his inspirations: the shoes. There are hundreds of them: mainly women's, most are vintage, some are brand-new, some come from Julie's notorious shoe stall in the nearby Portobello market, while others come from as far afield as Screaming Mimi's in New York, as well as Brazil and Japan. 'I found these brand new in this really weird shop in Amsterdam,' he says, stroking a pair of knee-high, brown Farah Fawcett-looking boots with nine-inch wooden heels. 'I think it was a hookers' shop, or something.' The range is spectacular. Red plastic 60s boots, Singaporean clogs with a landscape carved into the heel, obscure Japanese slippers, see-through plastic platforms, black-and-white patent 60s loafers, black vixen stilettos with gold chains and demure little vintage cream Celine loafers. The other half of the pairs are kept at his studio in Italy, where he spends part of the year designing. </p> <p>His own shoe cupboard is surprisingly messy - piles of Patrick Cox boxes and a couple of pairs of Nike trainers. Cox only wears a pair of shoes about eight times. After that, he reckons they start looking old. 'See, these are nearly done,' he says, scrutinising a pair of brand-new looking sandy suede boots. He is a perfect sample size eight, so every season can pick from over 60 of his own designs. </p> <p>There are photographs in frames every where: Patrick with Claudia Schiffer; Patrick with close friends Elton John and Elizabeth Hurley at Cannes; his mum with Elton; a strapping young man called Wesley in a fireman's uniform. In his British navy-blue painted bedroom, Patrick and Kylie pose in a frame on the marble mantelpiece. Hanging over the bed is an enormous white tableau transported from a chteau in the south of France, below lies a tiger-print bedspread. </p> <p>Cox's flat is one huge contradiction: the grandeur mixed with personal touches, the serious next to the frivolous: a stark white bathroom with a leopard-print towel; a simple kitchen lined with kaleidoscopic glassware; a photo of his mum next to Napoleon. It could be overbearing or bad taste, but Cox gives it his signature cartoon-like twist. </p> <p>Studying this perfect little haven, it's hard to imagine Cox traipsing over to Hackney when he was at Cordwainers in the 80s. 'It was like going to school in the Bronx,' he remembers, with a nervous laugh. 'I could only live in west London,' he says with conviction, and you believe him. 'It's where I fit.'</p>",
  "<p>Hussein Chalayan spends more time than is healthy flying between London and New York. The British Designer of the Year has even used airline seats as the inspiration for a collec tion, making dresses with built-in headrests. Another ingeniously used flaps and battery-powered moving panels, like the wings of a plane. Twice a year, the frequent flyer shows two different collections on the catwalk - his own in London and, across the Atlantic, the luxury cashmere brand TSE New York. If cloning was an option, Chalayan would be first in the queue, not just because he could do with another pair of hands, but because he'd like to know what it was like to be cloned. </p> <p>When he is not in New York or in London, chances are Chalayan is in Istanbul. He travels there five or six times a year, visiting his show sponsor, Turkish textile group IKTIB, which is eager to promote designers of Turkish origin. They could not wish for a better role model than Chalayan for the fledgling talent they are trying to encourage at home. Just seven years since he left college, Chalayan has achieved worldwide acclaim. </p> <p>In July, Time magazine listed him as one of their 100 most influential innovators for the 21st century. He was the only fashion designer, alongside architects, industrial designers and dotcom geniuses. This says a lot about either the snobbery of Time towards fashion as a form of design and innovation, or the elevated status Chalayan has achieved for himself internationally. He is f ted by both the serious architecture and design set, who identify with his conceptual and philosophical approach to fashion (when Zaha Hadid was looking for a designer to create the uniforms for the Millennium Dome, Chalayan was her first stop), and fashion groupies, who simply love his clothes. He has also been nominated as best avant-garde designer by this year's prestigious New York VH1 Awards. In July, American Vogue included him as one of the 12 designers who will change the course of fashion over the next decade. It described him as 'the premier intellectual designer of his generation'. </p> <p>The fuss is well justified. At his best, Hussein Chalayan has the ability to create magic. And he never gives anything but his best. He is a perfectionist to the point of near-madness. His shows are not just feats of creativity, cutting and tailoring, but also of precision-timed choreography, too. Not for him the catwalk with bored-looking models marching into the pop of camera flashbulbs. He has shown in an art gallery in east London, a warehouse in King's Cross, on a go-kart track in south London and the on stage at Sadler's Wells Theatre in Islington. He designs all his own sets, and has elevated the fashion show into performance art. </p> <p>For this autumn, Chalayan created a minimal white room, with table and chairs. As the show progressed, the models stripped the room bare, incorporating the contents - including the furniture - into their clothes. The idea came from seeing news reports about refugees fleeing from Kosovo. 'I come from a part of the world that's turbulent,' he says. 'The collection was about leaving your house in times of war and hiding your possessions. Kosovo was a reminder of what happened in Cyprus.' The audience held its breath as a round table was transformed into a telescopic wooden skirt, and chair covers metamorphosed into dresses. It sounds pretentious - anything to do with the designer's work usually does. But, in reality, the shows are breathtaking; well-executed and brilliantly conceived, as are the clothes themselves. No wonder the fashion world is jamming his phone lines demanding more seats for his show on Wednesday. A change of venue has meant he had to reduce the number of invitations to an intimate 500. </p> <p>Since his graduation show from Central Saint Martins in 1993, when he sculpted a corset out of wood and buried clothes in a garden with iron filings to see how they would rust and decompose, Chalayan has been one of fashion's most challenging designers. His first student collection was promoted in the windows of Browns on South Molton Street, the showcase which launched the career of John Galliano. At the time, Caroline Collis of Browns said: 'He has a real spirit to his work and we felt that, because it was a college show, he wasn't constrained. He wasn't at all concerned with commerciality. It will inevitably come, but what he's produced at this stage is very free, searching and exciting.' The collection was inspired by the 17th-century French philosopher Descartes, and the clothes told the story of a fictional female scientist. </p> <p>I remember interviewing him then. It was 1994. I was a junior fashion writer on The Independent. He was a shy, nervy young man, desperately aware how easily he and his work could be misunderstood. His friend, Bj\u00f6rk, had already adopted him as her favourite clothes designer, wearing his paper clothes on stage. Typically, however, he didn't really want to talk about it. Was he being perverse? Or was he simply trying to keep hold of his integrity? After the portrait session, he insisted on picture approval. It wasn't vanity. He was simply paranoid about the press and how he would be represented. He even turned up at the office and I had to take a selection of prints to show him in the shabby reception area. 'I don't want mass-market appeal,' he said. And he was doing his damnedest not to get it. </p> <p>While Alexander McQueen shocked with his bum cleavages, Chalayan took on the mantle of fashion's Thinker. He quietly experimented. One season, he made an entire collection using Tyvek, the unrippable paper usually reserved for envelopes. Another, he designed dresses with straps that were held in place by balloons filled with helium. He made up narratives in his head and clothed the characters in them. At times, despite the fact that he was living in respectable, right-on Crouch End in north London, he seemed to be on another planet. Ask him why he had designed a particular shape, or why he had made a dress fly like a kite, and he would embark on a long, philosophical discussion. While most fashion designers make your head spin with their flights of fancy, Chalayan would leave you reaching for your Encyclopaedia Britannica . </p> <p>He still does not aspire to reach the mass market, although he has learnt that in order to survive, he has to diversify. Business has been a struggle. The company does not yet own a computer. He has worked with Top Shop, creating a capsule collection of designs for the chain store's more fashion- forward teenagers. And. this autumn, his first pieces for the Marks &amp; Spencer Autograph range have arrived on the shop floor, although they will not be branded as his designs. He began designing a luxury cashmere collection for TSE New York, which added weight to Chalayan's profile in the States, but seemingly still acting as a subsidy for his own label. Slowly, he has been expanding into extra space in his Covent Garden headquarters. His own office is simple: white-washed with a basic office desk and chair. Nothing fancy. He is not interested in the trappings of the designer lifestyle. </p> <p>Chalayan has just turned 30. It's 18 years since he moved from his home in Nicosia in northern Cyprus to England, where he was enrolled at Highgate Boys' School in north London. For a shy young teenager, with an exotic-sounding name that no one could pronounce, it was just another battleground, at times lonely and brutal. 'We were told as kids in Cyprus that when you eat something, you always offer it to someone else first,' he says, and remembers thinking it was mean of the children at school that they never offered around their bags of crisps. </p> <p>It wasn't until he was 17 that Chalayan became aware of the fact that there was such a thing as a degree in fashion design. 'I was always interested in clothing the body, but didn't know there was a course you could do.' He had decided on a future as an architect. But when he read a magazine article about the Turkish designer Rifat Ozbek, he discovered the fashion degree at Saint Martins School of Art and Design. At that point, his future suddenly became a little clearer. </p> <p>If Chalayan's parents had not separated when he was a child, he may well have spent his student days in Istanbul University rather than in the ramshackle studios of Central Saint Martins on London's Charing Cross Road. As a child, he lived close to the frontline between north and south Cyprus. 'There was a real border culture. You are living in mystery and don't know what's on the other side.' And of course, that was precisely what the young Chalayan wanted to know. Perhaps that explains why he is so very inquisitive. His process of designing is the result of a constant quest to learn more, whether it's philosophy, religion or science and technology. He has a habit of deflecting questions back on his interviewers, and always asks more questions than he answers. 'I'm just a very curious person,' he says. 'I've always been inquisitive, wanting to learn about new things. The more you live, the more you realise you don't know.' </p> <p>One subject that interests Chalayan is Islam. For his spring/summer 1998 collection, he created one of his most provocative images. The show ended with a line-up of six models. The first wore a chador, which covered most of her body and allowed a gap just for her eyes. Each veil became shorter and shorter until, finally, the last one was nude apart from a mask covering her face. 'It was about defining your cultural territory,' he says. 'How a group of people define their territory with their clothes. The covering of the body was also representative of death, the veil bringing the body to a mummy-like state. It is a deathly state. You're pretending you don't exist. By becoming an anonymous person, you are creating your own territory. It was such a powerful show - so moving for me.' </p> <p>The designer is interested in breaking barriers. That is why he came up with the idea to photograph diverse families living in Istanbul and reproduce them in a limited- edition book to be given away at his show and sold in aid of Turkish charities. 'Istanbul breaks a lot of rules,' he says. 'It's not what you think it is. The diversity is rich and exciting. People think it's an Islamic state, but its incredibly secular. As I get older, I realise how many more undiscovered things there are in this part of the world.' </p> <p>Although he is Cypriot by birth, Chalayan is fascinated by Istanbul, its geographical position straddling Europe and Asia, and its cultural diversity. 'It is my favourite European city,' he says. Recently, he designed a dress for one of Turkey's most popular singers, Sezen Aksu. On Thursday morning, the Turkish newspapers will feature his London show. And after his show on Wednesday night, the TV crews will be lining up for their two minutes of air time with Chalayan backstage. Although he doesn't yet sell so much as a T-shirt in Istanbul, the city has adopted him as its own. He's happy to be their golden boy. </p> <p>Whenever he goes he makes sure he pays a visit to Mete and Nadire Goktug, an architect couple who have lovingly restored the ruin of an old British jail and turned the ground and first floors into a teashop. The top floor has a studio room with a wall of glass on one side. Occasionally, they entertain there, and sometimes spend the night, although they actually live somewhere else. </p> <p>Food is one of the designer's favourite subjects. His list of things to see and do in Istanbul does not start with the Blue Mosque or the Haghia Sophia, but a fish restaurant by the Bosphorus, or a traditional Turkish restaurant, whose specialities include a variety of weeds. 'The Galata tearoom has the most amazing atmosphere,' says Chalayan. 'And you have to try the man-ti! They are like Turkish dim-sum, little parcels of meat or potato. They serve it with yoghurt.' Sure enough, the steaming bowl of potato man-ti is delicious. Nadire will read your fortune after you've finished with your tiny cup of strong, black Turkish coffee. Chalayan admits to being very superstitious. 'I have a belief that if you don't do something in a certain way, things won't be right. I think I do things to prevent certain things happening, and believe some actions might bring bad luck.' </p> <p>It is unexpected to hear Chalayan talk of such things as superstition. Looking at his clothes, you would expect him to be completely rational and logical at all times. But he says it is all part of his cultural background. 'I'm more of an instinctive and emotionally oriented person,' he says. 'I was brought up to focus on my emotions and be in touch with them. That is how my background affects my work. I refer to Turkish costumes at times. But it's more to do with my childhood and how I was brought up.' </p> <p>He is, to put it mildly, a very complex character - totally dedicated to his work, and absolutely single-minded in its execution. His vision of the world, as expressed by the more extreme and conceptual pieces in his collections, is certainly a unique and uncompromising one. It is difficult to define the abstract workings of Chalayan's brain. But as long as those cogs keep turning, churning up visions of Islam, superstitions, philosphies, scientific formulae, memories of war and the breaking down of borders, Hussein Chalayan will continue to inspire and be inspired. And the fashion world is left hanging in the balance, waiting to see what magic he will weave next.</p>",
  "It's 10am in the lobby of Ian Schrager's hotel, The Sanderson. While the receptionist is calmly denying all knowledge of the person I'm looking for, an American woman passes by barking into her phone, 'You know who else is here? The woman who plays Carmela Soprano? Edie Falco?' <p>That's Edie Falco's status in life these days: she's TV famous, her face is emblazoned across billboards on Times Square. There are other female parts in The Sopranos, the HBO series that's made her name, that are showier: the terrifying matriarch Livia, played by the late Nancy Marchand, or the psychiatrist Dr Melfi, deftly played by Lorraine Bracco.</p> <p>But Carmela is the heart of the programme. Falco is effortless in the role, utterly real: despairing, loyal, tough, able to hold her own at unexpected moments. The Mafia wife who flirts with the priest, who makes the cannelloni, who seems so ordinary and decent and yet is an expert at stashing the cash when the Feds come calling. The fact that she's not flashy or obvious but you still notice her is what makes her performance special. And so Carmela Soprano, at least, is famous and getting more so by the minute. </p> <p>We meet at breakfast time, but Falco doesn't order any food. She drinks mineral water and smokes. 'I quit for three years,' she says. 'I only started again recently. And I'll quit when I'm back home. It's terrible, it's disgusting and I'm so sorry I started again.' </p> <p>Brooklyn-born, Long Island-raised, Edie Falco can sound like Carmela when she chooses. Sometimes, however, her speech shifts into something more precise, academic even. She doesn't look like Carmela either: the bouffant and talons are nowhere to be seen, and Mrs Soprano would never be caught out of the house without a scrap of make-up on. And, in what is a shocking admission for an Italian-American woman, she announces she can't cook. </p> <p>'I've hard-boiled eggs and even done that incorrectly. Fortunately, on the show they shoot me from the waist up so my hands look like they are doing something, and they've got all this beautiful stuff laid around me that the props people deal with, but I don't know a damn thing about cooking. I kinda like that.' Neither does she have children. 'I arrived on the set with these two kids and at first it was terrifying - like \"How in God's name am I going to pull this off? They seem like contemporaries of mine!\" But something kicks in. It's bigger than me, older than me, a sense of having dependence, of caring for someone younger than you. I found it much easier to fall into than I anticipated. I was pleased to find out it was very natural.' Falco, 36, says the experience has encouraged her to have children - 'especially now that I can afford them. But it's just, well, fitting them into the schedule.' </p> <p>It seems strange that The Sopranos has only been around for a year and half now, even less over here. Its position in the cultural canon already seems secure. And it has changed the way TV works in the US, helping shift the balance from the networks to the cable channels. There are no real arguments about whether it's the best TV show around, at least apart from the people who vote for the Emmy awards, who have just shunned it for the second year running. </p> <p>'We knew more or less what to expect,' Falco says. 'Truth is, people don't realise how expensive and time consuming it is to go along to an evening like that. I figured it would feel a bit more worthwhile if we won more. I suppose that sounds petty. I said to [the producers], \"Next time, can we just not go?\" It's not really a forum where we are welcome or appreciated.' </p> <p>Maybe it would help if you knew what happened last year. At the 1999 Emmys, although The Sopranos did badly, Falco won the best actress in a drama award. But that's not really what she remembers from the evening. Instead, her evening was spoilt when the TV panel convened by Joan Rivers and her daughter, deemed Falco's outfit - designed around a silvery Pamela Dennis halter top with tassels - the sartorial disaster of the evening. And although she knew that it shouldn't matter, it did. 'It felt like the popular girl at junior high had put gum on my back.' </p> <p>Why? 'Because I grew up a tomboy. Here I was, thrust into this world where I feel so out of place. I'm trying to do my best, to show up for these things. The truth is that it goes against my nature. So, I had made a conscious effort, a seemingly uneducated one, to do these things correctly. I had asked for help, and I went to the Pamela Dennis boutique. And she picked out this thing and I'm standing there like a mannequin with this thing on me that feels so outrageously uncomfortable and they all said \"Trust us\". And then I went out there, and these people said I was the worst dressed.' The next time she saw Joan Rivers, Falco spoke to her about it. 'This woman who used to be talented,' she says dismissively. 'She looks like some kind of sci-fi creature now with all the work she has had done.' </p> <p>When she talks about The Sopranos, she's as much a fan as one of the stars. She watches it like anybody else would watch it, helped, she says, by the fact that she's often forgotten the scenes by the time they air. And because she loves the show so much, she has spent a great deal of time trying to justify the violence to herself. </p> <p>'On some level it seems necessary. The point is they show you this guy, his lifestyle, in many dimensions. They are not trying to spoonfeed you in how you should feel about him. He's middle-aged, he's going through stress, panic attacks, taking medication, talking to a therapist. It's kind of lovely because you fall in love with him a little bit, recognise things about him. Then he turns around and kills a guy. And you're trying to figure out \"How can I feel for a guy who does that?\" And I think one of the reasons the show is so popular is people are left with questions rather than answers, an amalgam of feelings. And I think it's important that you show both sides of what this guy is like. And to allude to them is one thing, but to actually show them in all their darkness is probably necessary.' </p> <p>There's no great geographical spread to Falco's life: she grew up in Long Island, went to the State University of New York (SUNY) at Purchase and then moved to New York City. Home for Falco is her dog and boyfriend, John Devlin, a commercials director who she's dated for four years. She lives in a loft in Manhattan, owns a weekend cabin upstate. She doesn't like to be away from home for long. Two months spent on location in Italy were 'traumatic' she says. Earlier this year, she worked in London starring alongside Jason Priestly in The Side Man in the West End. 'After a couple of weeks, I lost the impulse to go out and explore, it felt as though something was missing. My heart, basically, had been left thousands of miles away. I sort of went inward.' </p> <p>Not surprisingly then, the idea of living in Los Angeles is anathema to her. 'There's something that goes on out there: people disappear. Personalities disappear. It's frightening. There's this look of desperation on so many of the faces. Every January, my actor friends begin the Los Angeles exodus for pilot season. It seems absolutely outrageous to me, because they all come back defeated and depressed. I speak to them over there, their vocal timbre is different, they just sound horrible.' </p> <p>There has always been a cautiousness, a reticence about Falco. She remembers being 'very shy' when she was growing up. Now she finds all the exposure Carmela has given her unsettling. 'By matter of what I do, I have to be put in positions where I am talking to people - representing HBO or the play that I'm doing - but, in fact, I am very shy.' </p> <p>She's happiest in and around New York, where she grew up. Her father, a graphic artist, is from an Italian background. Her mother's ancestry is Swedish, which she thinks explains the blonde hair. They moved out of Brooklyn to suburban Long Island when she was four, divorced when she was 14. </p> <p>For as long as she can remember, she wanted to act. She just didn't think that she was going to do it for a living. 'I always thought I would do it, some place or other, but I always figured I would have a real job, and I would just do acting on the side, because I thought that's how people did it. And then a teacher of mine at high school said, \"Why don't you study acting at college?\" On some level I've just fallen into it.' </p> <p>She studied acting at SUNY, where her contemporaries included Wesley Snipes, Posey Parker, Stanley Tucci and directors Hal Hartley, Nick Gomez and Eric Mendelsohn. She saw from the start that there was no point in trying to compete for the glamorous roles. 'I got all the weirdo parts: the blacked-out teeth, the fat suits, the old ladies. I always seemed older than I was.' </p> <p>The college connection helped out after she moved to New York in the late 80s; she got parts in films by Hartley (The Unbelievable Truth, Trust ) and Gomez (Laws of Gravity). But that wasn't enough to earn a living. So she took any job going. 'I worked for an entertainment organisation that takes a crew of people to weddings and stuff. I had to dress up as Betsy Ross once, sit on the centrepiece of a table while people ate their dinner. Guys got drunk and started looking under my skirt, it was a fucking nightmare. Other times, we had to dress up in outfits and pull people on to the dancefloor. At weddings, I'm the one in the chair praying that no one comes near me. And there I was, having to put on Cookie Monster with this giant head. The snotty little kid who ran the organisation, said, \"You gotta get out there, you gotta pull people on the dancefloor. Call yourself an actress?\"' </p> <p>She also trained as a graphic artist and a legal proof-reader. Mostly, though, she was a waitress. 'I could do a lot of tables, very quickly. I had a good short-term memory, but I was not very pleasant. Especially towards the end I was horrible, I was so unhappy. When I finally did leave, I had become so unpleasant and I started to feel the guilt; these people just came here for dinner and they don't need my 15 years of resentment as I throw their drink at them. I would watch some of the other waitresses being funny and flirty and think, there's not a chance in hell that I would do that. I'm just doing my job and I'm going home. I left to do a movie, but I knew I wasn't going to waitress any more. I think they are still holding my shifts for me at that restaurant.' </p> <p>She did off-Broadway plays, indie films and some episodes of the quality cop dramas Law &amp; Order and Homicide: Life on the Streets. The kind of stuff an actor does when they're trying to stick to their principles about decent scripts. And the things an actor is limited to when they stay well away from LA. Then in 1997, Tom Fontana, the genius behind Homicide, had a new show starting on the HBO cable network. Oz is a prison drama of both unrelenting brutality ('I don't watch Oz,' Falco admits. 'It's too difficult') and considerable artistic flamboyance, largely unknown in this country because Channel 4 transmits it at 1.40am. Fontana remembered Falco from her stint on Homicide and gave her a substantial role as a prison guard. It was a good move. </p> <p>A year or so later, they were casting for The Sopranos, another drama which takes advantage of the freedom from censorship and sponsor pressure that HBO's cable status brings. And Falco got the part of the gangster's wife. In almost every way, The Sopranos is of a fit with all the other well-written, carefully crafted, upmarket East Coast work she had done before. Her old friend Nick Gomez even directed an episode. She was, however, a little wary of her co-star. 'Jim Gandolfini has been cast as the bad guy so many times, so when he was cast as the husband I thought, \"Oh God, you have to have people feel for this guy.\" But the second I got on the set I realised he's fallen in to the same trap we all have: you get cast a certain way and if you want to get work you take those parts. He's one of the most charming, lovable, sensitive, perceptive, vulnerable guys I've met: he just hasn't had a chance to show that side of himself, and here he has. He's working a fine line, and doing it perfectly.' </p> <p>There was only one real difference between The Sopranos and everything else Falco had done: it became a massive hit. 'Television. Huge. I had no idea,' she says. 'A billboard, the size of this room, in Times Square with my face on it. Very weird, very, very weird.' And that changed everything else she was doing: people paid attention to The Side Man, a play she's been in for four years now, in various cities, because she was in it. And they paid attention to Judy Berlin, out here in November, which is otherwise typical of the kind of largely excellent, small indie movies she used to do before. She plays the title role, written for her by college friend Eric Mendelsohn: Judy is an ever optimistic actress planning to head out to the Coast, but working as a colonial milkmaid in a historical theme park. Judy seems much younger than Carmela, but Falco is quick to point out that it's not the age of the characters that makes them seem different, it is the life experience. Some US critics argued that the film is a more acute portrait of suburban life than American Beauty . The New York Times called her performance 'luminous'. </p> <p>Other things have changed, too. In the old days, Falco was reluctant to take cabs. She could not afford them, but she also liked the subway, liked watching people. Now, it's different. 'I'm recognised. I no longer have the luxury of watching people behave as they behave, because they are watching me. I loved my anonymous life in New York. There are so many people doing so many things and I could just wander around and watch and do whatever it is that one does. I don't have that luxury any more. All of a sudden to leave the house means having to talk to all kinds of people you don't know.' </p> <p>Edie Falco has only been in one proper Hollywood movie, Random Hearts. It stars Harrison Ford. I've never seen it, I confess. 'Me neither,' she says. Then she smiles, and gets excited. 'It was fun. It was really fun. It was two days and I felt like a little kid again.' Right now, for the only time in the interview, she sounds girlish. 'I almost passed out at the size of Harrison Ford's trailer.' </p> <p>Whether she accepts it or not, Edie Falco lives in the A-list world now. It's a matter of record, for instance, that this year she wore a purple Donna Karan dress to the Emmys. Because people love Carmela, they'll want to know about the woman who plays her. That's just the way it works. When I talked to her again last week, she was worrying about the looming actor's strike. I asked whether she was voting for industrial action. 'I suppose I should, yeah, because these are important things that we are fighting for. But it's also an odd position I'm in, because I am working and I'd much rather continue working, but I do have to think of the long term and my many friends who are struggling, so it's a rough call.' </p> <p>It's as if she can't quite believe her luck, that if she lets go now it will all disappear. It's not likely. Edie Falco may be an accidental star in some ways, but no one doubts she has the talent to make it last. And a toughness, an insistence on doing things on her own terms. Most of all, she's got a rare perspective on the insanity of the acting profession. 'It is almost humorous that of all the actresses I know, I would end up in this position. Because they all seemed like they wanted it so much more.'</p> <p><b>Life after the Godfather</b></p> <p>Just think about the title: The Sopranos - an intriguingly feminine choice of surname for the stars of a programme about a dysfunctional (is there any other kind?) Mafia family, but then the Sopranos are far more in touch with their feminine side than any of their screen predecessors. Uniquely, in the gangster oeuvre, the women are not portrayed merely as arm candy or two-dimensional victims - sometimes they even get the best lines. </p> <p>The drama is fuelled by the patriarchal mobster and occasional waste-management consultant Tony Soprano's (James Gandolfini) existential crises; the creeping, disillusioning sense that his very particular New Jersey Italian-American dream is imploding.</p> <p>In the pilot episode, Tony visits a beautiful female shrink, Dr Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco, who played Henry Hill's wife in GoodFellas), and declares sorrowfully, 'I came in at the end. The best is over.' 'Many Americans feel like that, I think,' she replies, but for Tony this is less a nostalgic lament for the state of America than it is for the demise of 'this thing of ours' - the perceived golden age of the Mafia crime family that he can now only enjoy via DVD home screenings of his favourite movie, The Godfather, invoked as if it were a documentary.</p> <p>'Most mob dramas are period pieces. Even if they're set in the present day, they feel like they belong to a different era,' says Sopranos creator-writer-producer-director David Chase. 'But the biggest threat to the Mafia is not the FBI or the police; it's the decline in morals, the fact that the next generation doesn't understand their heritage.' It is this sense that omert\u00e0 aint what it used to be that so haunts Tony, providing the show with both its finest comedy moments and its darkest, most unflinching drama.</p> <p>All Tony's relationships, particularly with the women in his life, are fraught. A love-hate tussle with his mother, Livia, the Borgia from the 'burbs (the extraordinary Nancy Marchand who, though she sadly died last June, will appear in the second series); his shrink Jennifer, whom he perceives as part-fantasy woman, part-ballbreaker; his Ivy League daughter Meadow, and his wife Carmela. It would be very easy for Carmela to be written (and played) as a predictably two-dimensional Noo Joisy stereotype wife, all jangling nerves and jewellery, but Falco is more than this.</p> <p>Torn between turning a blind eye to the family business in a bid to raise her children successfully (it might even work: young Anthony Jr sure doesn't look like a made man in the making) and her need to know enough to understand; confused by the fact that her devout Catholicism results in a crush on her priest (confession sometimes takes place, dangerously cosily, on the family sofa with a large glass of wine), Carmela is that rare beast - the modern, multi-faceted mafioso's consort.</p> <p>As drama, The Sopranos' great skill is to evoke our empathy: Tony may be a violent mobster, but he's no shark-eyed, sharkskin-suited Michael Corleone. Instead, he's a murderer who has panic attacks, a paunch, a troubled soul and a difficult marriage; struggling to understand precisely where, in an increasingly confused and confusing world, he fits in. And who can't relate to that?</p> <p><b>Family matters</b></p> <p>From mobsters to shrinks... The Sopranos hits the high notes.</p> <p><b> Kate Kray, Ronnie Kray's widow:</b> It gets inside the mind of the boss gangster. It's much better than Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels because it makes a farce of violence. The Sopranos might be a comedy, but it doesn't make out that the violence is funny. Like the women in The Sopranos , you've got to be strong-willed because one minute these men are up and the next they're down. You've got to be a good listener, but pretend you don't know anything. I know a lot of gangsters who watch it. As far as I know it's quite accurate for America, but I can't see a gangster this side of the water going to a psychiatrist. </p> <p><b> Professor Anthony Clare, psychiatrist:</b> The Sopranos casts an interesting light on the perennial issue of whether it is weakness or strength to go to a psychiatrist. In Tony Soprano, it's taken a stereotype of the Mafia mobster, and of masculinity, and put him in a stiuation where he's involved in an activity quite at odds with that. Therapy is focused on talking rather than doing, it's uncertain and ambiguous compared with the ruthless certainty with which he conducts the rest of his life. The reaction of the Mafia guys to Tony's therapy says a lot about our anxieties.</p> <p><b> Frankie Fraser, former East End gangster:</b> It could never compare to real life, but it tries its hardest to come up to it and in some respects it's not too far behind. The domestic situation is not quite right, though. They seem to feature women a lot and that wouldn't be as it really is. Their opinions are treasured, but obviously, in real life, women take a back seat. If any of my associates had gone into therapy he would have been kicked out because he'd be a danger. If he's that unstable that he's got to see a therapist, you can't rely on him.</p> <p><b> Fay Weldon:</b> The Sopranos can be described as an underworld comedy of manners, and it's been a long time since we've had such a thing. You know you will laugh, and you know there will be some acute social observations. Somehow the very ordinariness of a certain, socially acceptable violence is quite riveting. It comes out of an old tradition, the personal lives of rather likeable criminals. It's not in the Kray mode of worshipping criminals at all, it's a sympathetic portrait of people who the rest of society thinks are no better than they ought to be.</p> <p><b> Rhona Cameron, comic: </b> It is one of the best series that's been on television. It gives so many different insights into relationships, religion, loyalty, teenage angst and the life of gangsters. I missed the series on TV, so I bought it on video and watched it all in two days. Tony is one of the most sexy, attractive characters. It's odd when you start to love someone who kills for a living. In other gangster shows, there's little exploration of female characters, but in The Sopranos, you have three such complex characters in the wife, the mother and the therapist.</p> <p>\u0095 The second series of The Sopranos starts on Channel 4 on 12 October at 10pm. Judy Berlin opens on 17 November</p>",
  "Arpad Toth lights yet another cigarette and slumps heavily into a padded swivel chair. On the other side of the sliding glass doors at the far end of the room, darkness is falling. Momentarily, he raises his head and gazes balefully out at his disappearing garden. It was all going to be so perfect. It was going to be Eden. Now his five-year-old son is buried out there. <p>'I used to carry around this cyanide and I'll tell you, there were times when I was seconds away from... it looked like sugar. Looked exactly like sugar. Here, do you want some? You can have as much as you like...'</p> <p>He's smiling with his mouth, but not with his eyes, and I'm struck by the contrast between the muffled detonation of a man's soul and the fireworks on the Paulsgrove Estate in Portsmouth this summer, where cars were burnt and houses sacked and children carried placards screeching 'KILL THE BASTARDS' and chanted, 'Sex case, sex case: hang 'em, hang 'em, hang 'em' in reference to the faceless paedophile who is presumed to have taken Sarah Payne from her family. These two scenes, seemingly a universe apart, are about the same thing. This has been the summer of the dead child.</p> <p>We're sitting in a park on the outskirts of Croydon on a sunny September morning. Thirty feet away, a dozen or so small children are being entertained by a clown. The air is light with laughter and mums smirk as they hover watchfully in the background.</p> <p>'She's one of the better entertainers,' says Dee Warner. 'The ones we've had recently have been pretty bad. Even the kids noticed.'</p> <p>A conversation with Warner can be unsettling. One of the children giggling at the clown is her five-year-old son, Harry, while four-month-old Ellie sleeps in her pram. Our attention moves seamlessly between them and the unspeakable horror that is an everyday part of their mother's life. She and her friend Lynn Costello run the organisation Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, and the stories she carries around with her are shocking.</p> <p>There's the pair of 15-year-old girls seized by a gang of boys, taken to a barn, raped and set alight, then trammelled and scattered by firefighters who had no idea they were there; the parents whose daughter was knifed by a jealous schoolmate, whose only son then committed suicide next to a note indicating that he wanted to be with his sister. The man whose 10-year-old son and wife were beaten to death with a sledgehammer the day after the boy's birthday. The children taken and murdered by paedophiles and 'care in the community' psychiatric patients.</p> <p>It's lurid, horrendous, frightening stuff, and the examples given here are far from the worst. Warner and Costello formed MAMAA after James Bulger was killed by two 10-year-olds in 1993. They didn't have specific aims then, they just wanted to channel the despair they felt at a child being obliterated by other children. Now they run a helpline for the parents of murder victims from Warner's scrupulously tidy ex-local authority house on the edge of a pleasant estate. They also campaign for victims' rights and harsher punishments for offenders and supported the Paulsgrove protesters. What I want to know is how she lives with all this horror. And why?</p> <p>'Yeah, my brother-in-law says I'm paranoid,' she begins. 'He says I act like someone hanging around on every street corner waiting to take your child away. But I mean, what was the chance of Sarah Payne having a row with her brother and walking off? Sophie Hook was in her own back garden. People say I shouldn't make Harry so aware, but I'm afraid he is. When we did all the campaigning around [convicted paedophile] Sidney Cooke coming out, if he saw a picture of Sidney Cooke, he'd say, \"That man's really horrible and if you see him you should shout and shout and don't go with him.\" My sister said, \"Oh, my God...\" But what if he does see him?</p> <p>'And the scary thing is that with the \"name and shame\" thing, I showed Harry the photographs and he said, \"They don't look horrible, Mummy.\" I said, \"Well, that's the trouble, Harry, they don't always look horrible.\" People tell us that not all paedophiles murder, but they murder childhoods.'</p> <p>This is certainly true, but as I walk to my car, two things are running through my head. The first is a conversation I'd had with a child psychologist, who told me that an excess of fear can destroy childhoods, too. The second concerns a set of statistics supplied by the Home Office, which show that the number of children under the age of 10 who are known to be killed by strangers is astonishingly small.</p> <p>In 1994, there were none, while 1995 and 1996 saw two each, and the figures have remained more or less constant since figures became available. Most children are murdered and/or abused by people they know, usually relatives. Anyone who seriously wants to protect children might like to consider abolishing the family. These facts have been widely reported: we're aware of them, but it doesn't appear to help. My suspicion is that this is because, on the whole, we don't want it to.</p> <p>The fact is that something like 12,000 children under the age of 19 die each year. And nightmarish though Sidney Cooke is, even he can't match that. In this context, monsters become a soothing chimera, because monsters can be avoided, if we're good: the random horror of the world cannot. The problem is that the stories which have transfixed us this summer have had the effect of making child death seem at once palpitatingly present, yet also distant, freakish, unreal, little more than another opportunity for collective catharsis. Will Barbie be evicted from Big Brother ? Will the abducted girl die? These national cliffhangers are received in the same way, through the same media, and our collective responses look remarkably similar.</p> <p>The horror is increased, while the suffering is distanced. As one expert at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital scowled when asked to consider the idea that death is at least being brought out into the open: 'Yes, but if faced with a reality that's in danger of becoming too personalised, people still run a mile. The reality is as difficult as it ever was.'</p> <p>What follows is something of that reality.</p> <p>I'd heard and read a lot about Arpad Toth and his remarkable battle with the General Medical Council (GMC) following the unnecessary death of his son, but the man stalking across the drive to meet me was not what I'd expected. He is stocky and initially wary, a little spiky and nervous, prone to launch into lectures -almost any subject will do - at moments of discomfort. He built this drive, and the country house it leads to, and the stables and professional recording studio which take up most of the ground floor. Like a lot of perfectionists, he dresses his vulnerability with rigour, layers and layers of rigour - but a boy-like intensity radiates from his bleached-blue eyes and there is an agile, oppositional caste to his mind that is seldom less than entertaining. I found myself liking him very much. What I'd been told was true. You don't forget having met Toth.</p> <p>Now 47, his earliest memory is of watching tanks roll through the streets of Budapest from the balcony of his mother's apartment block. They escaped to England, where his mother married a fellow refugee, an art dealer. Arpad trained as an electrical engineer and worked as a technician at Oxford University before coming here. Eric Clapton and Radiohead recorded in the studio he built, and everything was progressing according to plan until his girlfriend informed him that she was pregnant. He was furious until his son, Wilfred, arrived, then fell in love in the hopeless, bewildered way that reluctant fathers often do.</p> <p>His boy was healthy, but had a congenital illness, a condition Toth describes as the inverse of diabetes, which meant that his body was capable of manufacturing and storing glucose in the liver, but couldn't retrieve it. The brain runs on glucose, so care had to be taken to ensure that Wilfred was given small but frequent feeds of carbohydrate or sugar. There had to be enough for his needs, but not so much as to burden the liver with excess supplies. It was a delicate balance to strike.</p> <p>The difficulty came at night, when the only way to regulate Wilfred's glucose intake was through a naso-gastric tube attached to a peristaltic pump. The system worked, but the pump had a serious design flaw in that once it had been set and the start button pressed, the only clear way to establish that it was working was to watch it for a period of time. Toth claims to have been close to finding a more reliable way of administering the glucose his son needed, when, on the morning of 9 October 1993, everything went wrong.</p> <p>Grimly but evenly, Toth describes the crisis which engulfed his family. That night, Wilfred's mother, a senior nurse who was six months pregnant with a second child, laid him in his usual place, between the spaces she and her husband would occupy in bed. She armed the pump and pressed the start button, but that night it didn't come on. Arpad came to bed early for him, at 2.30am, and watched satellite news, as was his habit, until he fell asleep. She rose early and fixed herself some coffee and was sitting up watching TV and reading the papers when Wilfred went into a violent hypoglycaemic fit. She woke her partner. According to them, it was now about 7.15am. They called their doctor's surgery and gave the boy some powdered glucose, which appeared to have no effect. What he needed was intravenous glucose.</p> <p>In their version, the doctor took an age to reach this very serious situation, then refused to administer the intravenous solution, instead offering barbiturates to control the fitting. Toth blames himself for his 'moment of doubt', during which he briefly lacked the confidence to insist that he knew better than a doctor who was about to do the wrong thing. Eventually, the GP called the local hospital in order to have Wilfred admitted 'for observation', then left. By the time the family arrived, manic and terrified, the brain damage caused by Wilfred's starvation of glucose was irreparable, and he never recovered from his coma. Toth turned off the life-support machine a week later, and the boy died in his arms.</p> <p>He took his complaint against his GP to the GMC and it was thrown out at the first hurdle, though if they'd known who they were dealing with, they might have reconsidered their haste. In the meantime, in his grief he refused to relinquish Wilfred to anyone. He took him home, called his friends round and they dug a huge hole in the frozen, wintry garden and plastered the walls and carpeted the floor until it looked like a scaled-down version of his son's room, Thomas the Tank Engine bed and all. One night, his partner came home and found the distraught Toth out there with a shovel, trying to rejoin his boy. When a daughter was born eight weeks later, in the same room in the same hospital as Wilfred, and a few doors away from the place where he died, her father could barely bring himself to acknowledge her presence.</p> <p>He blamed the doctor, his partner, himself, the universe. If there was still any kind of plot, he lost it, just wanted to exchange his grief for nothingness. He speaks of those early years with a kind of eerie detachment.</p> <p>'I think the only thing that stopped me from ending it then was that I thought, \"Christ, if I do this, I'll be betraying my son's memory.\" I gave in. I couldn't stand up to the powers that be. Then you think, \"Well, even if I make this statement, who would care? If they didn't care when my boy died, why the hell would they care when I die?\" So at times like that, I just went, \"Fuck it, I'm going to make a difference.\" And having suffered the ultimate insult, there's not a hell of a lot they can do to me any more, but there's a hell of a lot I can do in return.'</p> <p>I'd asked Arpad Toth whether he'd had anyone to confide in about all this. He'd replied that, no, he didn't; he'd felt alone, isolated, cut adrift from the rest of humanity. This is something you'll hear other parents say and which I caught a glimpse of on the train down to the Demelza House Children's Hospice in Sittingbourne, Kent.</p> <p>I was reading a leaflet giving details of an intense-sounding weekend course aimed at helping children come to terms with the death of relatives. At the end of it were some comments from participants and their guardians. One ran: 'My child was surprised to find other children in the same situation. When he told his story, he was really amazed that the other children did not laugh.' I must have appeared troubled by this, because I looked up to find the girl sitting next to me shifting her gaze uncomfortably and the woman opposite doing likewise. They'd seen what I was reading. They thought I'd lost a child - at least that's what I thought they thought - and a voice deep inside me wanted to say, 'No. No, I haven't. I'm OK. I'm like you.'</p> <p>I'm OK? And then I knew: we're afraid of people in this situation. We don't know what to say and fear the bleak force of the emotions involved, as though, in allowing them to enter us, we might conjure them into reality. If we infantilised inhabitants of the 21st century only relate to things we can identify with, the converse is also true: if we don't want to be identified with something, we shun it.</p> <p>Demelza House is a joyous place, with verdant grounds and everything a child with a terminal illness needs in order to be the careless scamp they deserve to be at this stage of life. Yet if you ask the staff how their jobs are perceived outside of their immediate environment, you will hear the same thing again and again. 'People either seem to see us as angels or lunatics,' says administrator Liz Johnson. 'And the effect on strangers when you tell them what you do can be astonishing. Conversations just stop. It's as though you've just told them you have leprosy. We tend to stick quite close to each other around here.'</p> <p>Staff on the Child Death Helpline at Great Ormond Street will tell you that people they call simply don't hear the word 'death' in their title. They hear 'deaf' or 'deer' or 'deb', or simply nothing at all ('Child wha'?') - anything but the reality. The few who do hear tend to gasp and try to get off the phone. The line has been going for five years, is staffed mostly by volunteers who've lost children and if you really want to know what the reality of the experience is, this is the place to visit.</p> <p>Anna, a volunteer, lost a 14-year-old son to leukaemia.'Most of us go through life assuming this will happen to someone else, and not beginning to understand what it's like. People feel huge sympathy, but just don't know what to say. Unfortunately, I think that one of the things which has come from all the reporting of children dying is that people suddenly become authorities on it and will try to demonstrate this to you, that they understand what you're going through. But they don't, they can't. And then in a month or so, they'll say, \"I expect you're feeling better now.\" People can get carried away on the wave of the feeling, or what they think this feeling is, and all these publicised tragedies have encouraged people to think that this is their way of being a part of that, you know. And they have no idea. You find yourself thinking, \"Why are you doing this? Just go about your business, maybe say a little prayer and be thankful it's not you...\"'</p> <p>So what does she say?</p> <p>'When you get a first-time caller and you're suddenly faced with this thing that has happened, my stomach immediately goes and the only thing I can say is, \"I'm just so sorry.\" Because I am. Just so sorry. People, I think, do find it hard to say that. It sounds trite, but sometimes it's all you can say.'</p> <p>Anna and her colleagues all talk of the isolation, the guilt, the blame, the anger, the fear for their other children and the loss of trust in the world, the complete loss of confidence, broken relationships, sense of helplessness and failure; the way you try to protect other members of your family and compensate for friends' discomfort, and the pressure this puts on you. The anniversaries, the pain when other children or grandchildren reach and pass the age at which yours died. The fact that your child, to one degree or another, had to make their final journey on their own. If the death was violent, there may be elements of post-traumatic stress - flashbacks, nightmares, imaginings of the fear the child might have felt. You never 'get over it', and there is no resolution. All you can do is learn to accommodate the loss, says coordinator Jean Simmons. The old five-stage models of grief, which purport to culminate in some sort of transcendence, she adds, are a waste of time.</p> <p>'We don't find those old linear models, in which you help people through certain stages until they can let go and resolve, helpful. We think it's more about holding on, finding ways to incorporate the loved person into your everyday existence, to recognise how they changed you and the influence they continue to have on your life and relationships.</p> <p>'Here, they won't be pathologised. The death of a child is special because, fortunately, not many will experience it. Nevertheless, there is a fear of bereaved people in society, which is strange, because it will happen to everybody at some stage, yet we treat it as if it were a pox. I think that's why they tend to be rushed off to counsellors. The pain is dealt with as an individual psychological response, but this is not something that's gone wrong with the bereaved individual - their response is normal and natural. The problem, often, is around them.'</p> <p>I wanted someone to tell me that the pain ends and things are all right in the end, but I'm not hearing that. No wonder we're scared of this stuff.</p> <p>Toth didn't believe in counselling either. Chain-smoking in his studio late into the night, he veers between sounding like Hamlet and General Patten as he describes his seven-year journey to here. Everything has changed. His relationship with his partner and daughter never recovered, for a start.</p> <p>'I suppose we never quite came back to each other,' he says quietly. 'Something's changed - I can't put my finger on it. And every time I look at my son's picture, I think, \"Christ, here we are seven years on, and I haven't achieved anything yet.\" I mean, I've achieved this, but it's still not enough.'</p> <p>By 'this', Toth means a famous victory he has just won over the GMC in the High Court, which could have far-reaching consequences for many, many people. According to his lawyer, Lee Ranford of Russell-Cooke Potter &amp; Chapman, 98 per cent of complaints brought to the GMC have hitherto failed, with an astonishing 90 per cent being rejected at the initial 'screening' stage. Now the organisation, whose motto is 'protecting patients, guiding doctors' ('We think it's been the reverse up to now,' says Ranford), has to have 'compelling reasons' for throwing out a complaint at this first stage, and must justify its decision, disclosing the evidence used to reach it. Toth has dozens of legal binders from the actions he has 'been forced' to bring against a range of parties.</p> <p>He appears to have been treated badly and can now re-animate his complaint against the GP involved in his son's case. He thinks that the same is true for many thousands of previous complainants and that, if even some of them make use of this new opportunity, the GMC would not be able to cope and would have to be replaced by an official body that could. Undeniably, this is an extraordinary thing that Toth has done, and there would appear to be plenty more to come.</p> <p>But what happens when the legal distractions are over and Arpad is just left with Arpad? I have to ask the question four times before he will give an answer that doesn't involve proceedings of some kind.</p> <p>'Well... it's something for me to do, isn't it. What I really like doing, what I've done all my life, is... I like inventing things. I like writing my music. I like doing my gardening. I don't really need to socialise. I'm quite happy with my own company and just dipping in and out of society as I need to. And I'd like a peaceful life. I don't want to be in strife all the time. But I find that nobody else is doing it. Nobody else is saying, \"I'm there for you.\"'</p> <p>Does the pain ever lessen?</p> <p>'No. Not really. You have flashbacks. You have dreams. You wish you could turn the clock back. If only I did something different. If only I didn't have that moment of doubt. It's a constant source of torment. You're faced with these people telling you they know and eventually you think, \"Maybe I am being hysterical, overreacting, losing my marbles,\" and eventually you cave in. And of course, death comes almost instantaneously and then you realise, \"Oh my God, I can't change my mind. In the space of one or two seconds, everything went, and there's no turning back.\" And even now I wake up in the middle of the night and say, \"Oh, he's here! Oh no, fucking hell, he ain't. It was a dream.\"</p> <p>'To lose a child is worse than losing a parent. It's unnatural, especially when it was avoidable. So you can't even inure yourself to the possibility, because the thought is too horrendous. So I think what'll probably happen is that this'll never finish. Even when the case against the doctor is concluded, I think that probably my path is set. I will always be there for the underdog. To try and change the system. Maybe one day I might even do something that will make it a bit more fair.'</p> <p>Arpad is slowing. I'm watching him dissolve like a snowman in the rain. 'You know, occasionally, when one of the animals died - a cat or a sheep - he made me promise that I would never die. Silly little thing. Then it turns out...'</p> <p>I'm wondering what to take from all this as I leave the Child Death Helpline offices and cross the road for a tour of Great Ormond Street Hospital. Like Demelza House, it is a buoyant, optimistic place, where thousands of children are being helped, cured, made more comfortable. Even here, though, the range of emotion you encounter makes your head swim. The horror is never far away. Outside, I'd passed a man and woman standing, he with his arms around her, each staring into some cruel and private distance, simply looking stranded.</p> <p>In the chapel, a big book where people can set down thoughts or prayers contained many entries along the lines of 'Please help me through my op. Charlotte, age 7' and 'Please help my friend Lynn.' One mother wrote a daily account of how her daughter's operations were going and you could feel her mood swing from hope to desperation to relief to anxiety, her girl's pain playing her like a game of poker. The entry that followed me home, though, simply read: 'Lord hear our cries and have mercy on my son. Please keep him safe in your arms forever.'</p> <p>Then, in the cancer ward, the revelation, as I watched a little girl of six or seven struggle through a door with a mobile drip which was so much bigger than she, then wrestle it grimly down the corridor. She'd lost her hair, presumably as a consequence of chemotherapy, and her face was misshapen, distended, with harrowed eyes wide with determination. You looked at her and your only possible thought was, 'This is not right. It shouldn't be happening,' at which point you either burst into tears or pull your jacket over your head, crouch to the floor and hop around like Basil Fawlty impersonating a frog. Neither, it is fair to assume, would be of much help.</p> <p>The thing is, we expect to be able to protect our children. We lead them to believe that we will, and in the main we do, but their childhood ends the day we no longer can, or will, and so does any echo of our own. In the adult world, joy tends to be anticipated, where horror drops out of the sky. We want the opposite for kids, for horror to be seen in advance and susceptible to control, while joy just happens. And we can't have that.</p> <p>Jean Simmons had told me that one of the most agonising decisions parents face when a child dies is what to dress them in for the funeral. 'They nearly always talk about dressing the child warmly,' she said. 'They're afraid they'll be cold.' And then it struck me that we're only here on loan to our children, and they to us.</p> <p>And that all the horror I've seen and been told about only has force because it corresponds to love. I decided to go home and take the kids to the park and hand this article in late.</p>",
  "<p>As London Fashion Week kicks off and hordes of stick-thin models descend on the capital, Real Women attempts to redress the balance by bringing together work by 20 artists - including photographers Rankin, Nick Knight and rising star Jo Broughton - that offers more realistic representations of the female form. </p> <p>Broughton, 25, who graduated with a first in photography last year, has caught the attention of the art world as well as the photographic industry and was recently nominated for the prestigious Citibank Photography Award. Her work is starkly honest and hauntingly beautiful - her no-frills portraits of herself posing with a series of other women came about as a comment on the tendency among women to compare their bodies. For Real Women, she is showing two portraits from the project; one of herself with an ex-glamour model and another with fashion designer Nadja Copland. </p> <p>'I photographed 50 women in all,' says Broughton. 'And it was quite a cathartic experience. I always let the model choose the pose - they had more control that way - and that made me, as the photographer, the vulnerable one. Sometimes I looked bloody awful, but I still used the pictures because I didn't want to manipulate the process.' </p> <p>Finding subjects who were prepared to appear in the project - warts, stretch marks and all - wasn't easy. 'I put ads in magazines and approached people in the street or in bars,' she says. 'And the more pictures I took, the more diverse my subjects became. There was a transvestite I wanted to photograph, and I had to go to this gay bar for six months to gain his confidence. In the end, we did the shoot and I felt strangely awkward and clumsy next to him - he seemed so feminine.' </p> <p>\u0095 Real Women runs from 27 September to 30 October at AKA Bar and Restaurant, 18 West Central Street, London WC1 (020 7836 0110).

  "<p>My single-parent daughter has a severely disabled child. She has been renting a house from a private landlord through a letting agent. The landlord's mortgage lender, Abbey National, has informed her that it is repossessing the property because the landlord is in arrears with his repayments, and it has given her notice to quit. </p> <p>The letting agent denies responsibility for the landlord's conduct. The tenancy is only five months old and my daughter has incurred the expense of a deposit, an agency fee, a credit rating investigation charge, removal costs and making the house suitable for a disabled child. She has no resources left to rent again and feels she is due compensation for a situation outside her control. Her local authority should rehouse her, but there is nothing suitable in Walthamstow, where she lives. She needs to be able to park near the house because she has to carry oxygen around for her daughter. What can she do?<strong><br>DH, Glastonbury</strong></p> <p>Your daughter will not be able to stay in her home if Abbey National repossesses it. Lenders can throw tenants out before the end of their leases because they must sell the property for the best price. Your daughter should contact her local authority immediately, because it has a duty to rehouse her once she is homeless. She should insist on a long-term assessment of her daughter's needs, so she is not just reacting to her current crisis but planning ahead. </p> <p>The problem is always shortage of property, so there is no guarantee there will be a home available, but the council is in touch with housing associations who might have more suitable accommodation. She can ask to be nominated to a housing association, giving her the advantage of a landlord experienced in housing tenants with disabilities. Habinteg is one housing association in the area that designates a quarter of its homes for wheelchair users. </p> <p><strong> A price in ticking the wrong box</strong></p> <p>Many Scottish Widows' policyholders seem to have 'ticked the wrong box' in ignorance of their likely payouts and are now looking at big capital gains tax bills. In my case, the loss is \u00a315,000, a third of my compensation. If I had known how large the windfall would be, I could have taken the loan note option offered specifically to avoid this problem. It is frustrating that Scottish Widows provided inadequate information to support this choice and doubly frustrating that they are now refusing to make changes.<br><strong>TR, London</strong></p> <p>Scottish Widows admits to being 'prudent' in its estimates of the windfalls which led you to believe the cash payment would be below the \u00a37,200 annual capital gains tax allowance. But the insurer says you could have picked the option that hedged your bets, allowing you to take cash unless the windfall exceeded the tax allowance, in which case you would get loan notes. But you ticked the 'cash' box, and, says Scottish Widows, the form you signed was 'irrevocable and binding'. It says the cut-off point is permanent. </p> <p><strong> Over the top bill for over-70s</strong></p> <p> I phoned Liverpool Victoria to insure a three-week holiday to the US for me and my wife. I was quoted \u00a3172. I then contacted the Retired Insurance Advisory Service (RIAS), which quoted \u00a392. I assume actuaries work out the cost of covering the risks involved, add a reasonable profit and then come up with a price. How can two insurers come up with such wildly different figures?<strong> <br>WJ, Llanbadarn Fynydd </strong></p> <p>Underwriters forecast how many people are likely to claim on a policy, so insurers can pitch premiums to make a profit. But insurers make their own decisions about how much profit they want. Then, these two policies might not have been identical: one might pay more for, say, medical expenses. But the main difference is that Liverpool Victoria, like most insurers, weights the price of holiday policies against older travellers believing the over-seventies are more likely to claim. RIAS does not. </p> <p><strong> Simple question, taxing answer</strong></p> <p>Premiums on my Sun Life of Canada endowment policy have been paid up, although it does not mature until December 2001. Recently I asked about cashing it in, and the company warned that I might incur tax. My tax office said the proceeds would be tax free. I asked for the Inland Revenue's written confirmation and received eight pages of incomprehensible tax-speak with a covering letter stating that the Revenue is in fact 'unable to confirm that proceeds from an early surrender would be tax free'. Is there a straightforward answer to this simple question?<strong><br>JV, London</strong> </p> <p>Yours was originally a qualifying life insurance policy, which means there is no tax to pay on the proceeds. But it lost its special tax status because you had it made paid up (stopped paying premiums but kept the policy) when it had been running for fewer than 10 years. You face tax whether you cash it in early or on maturity, but you will pay tax only if you are a higher-rate taxpayer when you get the money or the payout itself pushes you into the higher-rate band. </p> <p><strong> Dial up help with pensions sums</strong></p> <p>I have been corresponding with the DSS for months about the value of my additional state pension. Where can I get information to enable me to calculate my entitlement?<strong><br>LT, Solihull</strong></p> <p>The DSS calculates additional pension by taking the difference between the lower earnings limit (the point at which you start paying National Insurance contributions) and the upper earnings limit, revalued at today's prices. It takes 24 per cent of that figure and divides by the number of years in your working life. </p> <p>Ring the helpline on 0191 218 7585 for help filling in the application form, BR19. </p> <p><strong>What's the catch?</strong></p> <p>The Australian Lottery Office has been offering readers a 'guaranteed unique method to potentially collect millions of dollars each week'. </p> <p>The company claims that, by using sophisticated computer software and years of lottery data, it has identified specific sets of numbers that stand a greater chance of winning the Australian 6/45 Lottery. A letter to readers in the UK includes a set of 'approved 10 numbers' to enable them to 'cash in'.</p> <p>The letter goes on to describe how the Australian 6/45 Lottery, shown live on television in Australia every Saturday night, draws six main numbers and two bonus numbers from balls marked 1 to 45.

  "<p>Homeowners face a tenfold increase in the risk of flooding and other weather- related damage to their property, the Environment Agency is warning. </p> <p>The Government body launched a new flood warning system last week with the prediction that Britain could become a flood 'hot spot', with 5 million people already living in flood risk areas. The agency says changing UK climate patterns will result in a 10 per cent increase in annual rainfall, wetter winters and more summer storms - all of which could cause flooding. </p> <p>Chairman Sir John Harman said: 'Flood risk is now a fact of daily life. Reports of flooding are now on average nearly twice as frequent as they were 100 years ago. More worryingly, with climate change, we could see up to a tenfold increase inrisk over the next century.' </p> <p>Even if your home has never previously been affected, there is no guarantee that you will remain safe. Last year, only one in eight people whose homes were flooded had experienced anything like it before. The agency fears that Government plans to build 23 million new homes in the next 15 years could exacerbate the problem. It is working with the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions to introduce tougher guidance for plan ning authorities to curb development in flood plains. </p> <p>Properties with 'river frontage', 'lake' or 'sea views' are in great demand, yet they are particularly at risk. </p> <p>Harman warns: 'Flood risk will not automatically be included in the property search when you are buying a new home. You must request it from your solicitor or do your own homework.' </p> <p>You can ring the agency's new Floodline on 0845 988 1188, or request a personal call-back by clicking the 'phone-me' option on its website, <a href=\"http://www.environmentagency.gov.uk\">www.environmentagency.gov.uk</a> to find out if your home is at risk. It also offers practical hints on how to minimise the financial and emotional impact of a flood. </p> <p>Portsmouth residents had first-hand experience of the new warning system last week. Torrential downpours and the breakdown of a local pumping station sent a tide of raw sewage pouring through 115 homes. The damage will take months, if not years, to repair fully. </p> <p>So what can you do to protect yourself and your property? The first step is to make sure you have adequate home and contents insurance. The Association of British Insurers says nearly 40 per cent of UK homes have no buildings insurance, and 25 per cent of homes at risk of flooding have no contents cover. </p> <p>Paul Charles of online broker Screentrade says even those who have cover may find they are under-insured: 'Flooding is classed as a \"standard peril\", and all buildings and contents poli cies include it, but you don't want to guess that your contents are worth \u00a320,000 when they are actually worth \u00a340,000.' The average claim for flood damage is \u00a36,000 to \u00a37,000. </p> <p>If your home has been flooded before, you may find your insurance premiums are raised, but don't be tempted to mislead the insurance company. </p> <p>Charles says: 'Insurers check the information you give them with your previous insurer, and they will discover if you try to conceal a previous claim. If you are found out, your policy could become null and void.' </p> <p>It is a good idea to make a record of the damage done to your home as soon as possible. Make a video or take photographs while the water is still inside, if possible. </p> <p>Some policies provide immediate assistance for flood victims. However to ensure that you can contact your insurer quickly, Charles recommends keeping your policy documents (and all other important documents, passports and valuables) on the first floor or higher. </p> <p>Many victims say the worst aspects of flooding come during the recovery period. After the flood, it's vital to clean the property as soon as possible to minimise problems caused by damp. The longer a home spends under water, the greater the damage to its fabric.</p> <p><strong>'The dog barked, then we were walking in water' </strong></p> <p>John and Jeanette Taylor have been flooded twice in the past two weeks. Although they live on the Ridge - which is high up, as its name suggests - in Hastings, they suffered from overflowing drains two Fridays running. </p> <p>'The first time we were asleep in bed, and the dog woke us up by barking. My wife got out of bed and found she was walking in water,' says John.</p> <p>The second time, after it had rained heavily for 10 minutes, water started coming in under the door.</p> <p>'There was very little warning,' John says.</p> <p>On both occasions, sudden thunderstorms sent water flooding through their roof and overwhelmed both their mains drainage - only 4in in diameter - and the sewerage system, which are just outside the couple's front door. Luckily the house has an upside-down design, with the bedrooms on the ground floor and the living room and kitchen on the first floor. This meant that their documents and valuables were safe on the first floor.</p> <p>However, the flooding has ruined the Taylors' downstairs carpet, their wiring and the decoration in their bathroom.</p> <p>Eagle Star, their contents insurer, has arranged for a company to start work on drying out the house. Although the couple have not yet received estimates of how much the repair work will cost, John expects a replacement carpet alone to cost about \u00a3500.</p> <p>He also believes work will be needed to widen the drainage system to prevent future flooding.</p> <p><strong>How to stay safe </strong></p> <p>You can't prevent flooding, but you can be ready. The Environment Agency suggests these steps:</p> <p>\u0095 Check with the agency's Floodline, on 0845 988 1188, whether your property is at risk and ask about local warning arrangements.<br> \u0095 Keep a list of useful numbers: your council, emergency services, insurance company and Floodline.<br> \u0095 Find out where to turn off your gas and electricity. If you are unsure, ask the person who checks your meter when they next visit.<br> \u0095 Make up a flood kit, including a torch, blankets, waterproof clothing, wellington boots, a portable radio, first aid kit, rubber gloves and key personal documents. Keep it upstairs if possible.<br> \u0095 Buy a few sandbags or floor boards to block doors and airbricks, but ensure there is still adequate ventilation.<br> \u0095 Get into the habit of storing valuables upstairs.</p> <p>When you hear a flood warning:</p> <p>\u0095 Move people, pets and valuables upstairs or to higher ground.<br> \u0095 Drive your car to higher ground. It would take only 2ft of fast-flowing water to wash it away.<br> \u0095 Check on your neighbours - do they need help?<br> \u0095 Keep warm and dry. A flood can last longer than you think, and it can get cold. Take warm clothes and blankets, a Thermos and food.<br> \u0095 Make sure you have any medication you need to take regularly.<br> \u0095 Don't walk in floodwater above knee level. It can easily knock you over, and may hide hazards.</p> <p>After the deluge:</p> <p>\u0095 Call your insurance company and report what has happened.<br> \u0095 Check Yellow Pages under Flood Damage for cleaning materials or equipment to dry out your house.<br> \u0095 Check drainage systems.<br> \u0095 Ask gas, electricity and water companies to check your supplies before you turn them back on.<br> \u0095 Open doors and windows to ventilate your home. A brick dries out at the rate of an inch a month. Unblock airbricks and doorways.<br> \u0095 Wash taps and run them for a few minutes before use.<br> \u0095 Remove wet carpets and furniture.<br> \u0095 Don't touch items that have been in contact with the water, which may may be contaminated and contain sewage. Disinfect and clean thoroughly everything that got wet.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Isobel Parker <br> Age:</strong> 40<br> <strong> Lives in:</strong> Chichester, West Sussex<br> <strong> Occupation:</strong> Community health development officer<br> <strong> Earns:</strong> \u00a327,000<br> <strong> Mortgage:</strong> \u00a363,000<br> <strong> Debts:</strong> Credit card and other debts totalling about \u00a38,000<br> <strong> Investments:</strong> \u00a3200 in a Tessa<br> <strong> Pension:</strong> Member of occupational scheme<br> <strong> Aim:</strong> To clear her debts in the best way and start saving</p> <p>Earlier this year, Isobel Parker returned from Romania, where she had spent 12 months working with Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), helping develop community health services for women and children. Although she had experience in a similar field here, working with rural communities who had, among other things, no access to running water, provided a very different set of challenges. </p> <p>Now back home, she faces the next challenge: sorting out her finances. </p> <p>'When you work for VSO you are paid at the local rate, which in my case was \u00a3120 a month. Although I had let my house in Chichester while I was away to help cover expenses in the UK such as my mortgage, the rent did not cover everything. So I ran up a fair amount of debt. I would now like to find out the best way to clear it.' </p> <p>The bulk of her debts - \u00a36,000 - went on two credit cards, with First Direct and RBS Advanta. Currently she is making only the minimum monthly repayments on these. In addition, she has an agreed \u00a31,200 bank overdraft and an informal loan of \u00a31,000 from friends. </p> <p>She is wondering whether to consolidate her debts by taking out a personal loan, or to add them to her mortgage - \u00a363,000 with Halifax. It is a fixed-rate loan with a redemption penalty period expiring in 2003. She is repaying it through a mixture of an endowment (\u00a344,000), an Isa (\u00a315,000) and an ordinary repayment loan (\u00a34,000). </p> <p>She says she has enough spare equity in the property to increase her mortgage if necessary and estimates it is now worth around \u00a395,000. </p> <p>She took a sabbatical from her job with a Health Authority when she decided to go to Romania, but has now decided to move on to a new position with a local authority, for which she needs a car. Fortunately her new employer is providing her with a loan for this purpose. She has also become a member of the local government pension scheme, to which she is transferring the benefits she had built up with the NHS scheme. </p> <p>Her pension scheme pro vides her with some life assurance and she also has \u00a313,000 of critical illness cover. She has two bank accounts, with the Halifax and with First Direct. </p> <p>Her only savings are just less than \u00a3200 in a Tessa, which she opened with First Direct just before the tax-free accounts were abolished in April 1999. Once she has sorted her debts out, she would like to save more for the future.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Sharon Linnard</strong></p> <p>VSO work can be very rewarding but not financially, as Isobel has discovered. She is right in making debt repayment her first priority because, although minimum payments on credit cards seem acceptable, the underlying interest rate is surprisingly high. First Direct's rate is 18.9 per cent a year, with RBS Advanta not far behind at 17.9 per cent. </p> <p>One way of containing this is to make an application to a different provider where for a limited period a much lower rate is charged on debts transferred. A good example is the Nationwide Building Society whose Visa Card.</p> <p>However, this only buys time. Isobel should try to reduce the amount outstanding as much as she can in that period. Were there more in her Tessa, it would be tempting to use that to reduce borrowing, but she may prefer to keep the account open so that once her debts are repaid, she can resurrect a very tax-efficient account.</p> <p>She could talk to the Halifax about suspending payments under the Isa for a period and converting the whole of her loan to interest-only for the time being, though the endowment should be maintained. This would allow her to reduce her credit card borrowings.</p> <p>On the positive side, Isobel is a member of an excellent occupational pension scheme which, to some extent, reduces the urgency over increasing her savings. </p> <p>\u0095 Sharon Linnard works for chartered accountant Blick Rothenberg.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Gordon Wilson </strong></p> <p>The key to clearing debt is to focus on the rate of interest being paid and find the cheapest rate possible. Overdrafts are generally expensive. In addition to high interest rates, there are often transaction charges. I would also steer clear of personal loans. Rates tend to be high and they are inflexible, although this can suit people who need the discipline of fixed repayments. </p> <p>Isobel does not really have the option of increasing her mortgage, due to the redemption penalties. She could review the position in 2003. Depending on how much debt she has cleared, increasing the mortgage could be useful.</p> <p>I would suggest that Isobel considers consolidating her debt to a low cost credit card. Very low introductory rates are currently available. Isobel could then establish how much she can afford to repay each month and set up a direct debit to the card company.</p> <p>This means Isobel is in control and the debt can be cleared more quickly if funds become available. One catch is that many credit card companies offer the introductory rate for only six months; after that it could increase substantially. Isobel would need to transfer her balance before the rate increased.</p> <p>Once the debt is clear, Isobel's thoughts should turn to her retirement. She could consider Additional Voluntary Contributions, Stakeholder Pensions and Isas. </p> <p>\u0095 Gordon Wilson works for financial adviser Aitchison &amp; Colegrave. </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only.</p> <p>\u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

  "<p>Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott will tomorrow launch a renewed crackdown on company directors who neglect health and safety regulations in their businesses. </p> <p>In the first of two speeches to Labour's conference in Brighton this week, Prescott will unveil a package of measures including harsher fines for safety breaches; a clearer definition of directors' responsibilities for health and safety; and measures to 'recycle' proceeds from financial penalties paid by directors and companies into strengthened regulation. An enhanced role for trade union safety representatives will also be included. </p> <p>Officials at the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions are also working with the Home Office to strengthen the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions in securing convictions for health and safety breaches, and are co-operating on Jack Straw's plans for a new charge of corporate manslaughter. </p> <p>Figures in the most recent Health and Safety Executive annual report indicate that fatal injuries at work fell from 274 in 1998 to 257 in 1999, and that there were falls of 5 per cent in major non-fatal accidents and those which kept people away from work for at least three days. </p> <p>However, trade unions have argued that not enough is being done to reduce these levels faster, and have mounted a high-profile campaign spotlighting the continuation of dangerous practices by many firms and the need for clearer and more effective regulations. </p> <p>Prescott believes that directors do not take health and safety issues seriously enough, and that the only way of focusing attention on the issue is to come down hard with a major review of fines and the introduction of new methods of preventing bad practice. </p> <p>The Government does not simply want to raise penalties; it wants to overhaul health and safety regulations. There are also plans to 'fast track' certain offences where there is a feeling that the directors are guilty of gross negligence. </p> <p>A government source said: 'We think the penalties for putting workers' safety at risk are not tough enough. In health and safety law the punishment does not fit the crime Higher fines are a certainty.' </p> <p>The measures will form part of a new Safety Bill which is likely to be put on to the legislative programme early in the next parliament if Labour wins the general election. Sources say the DETR is already pushing for early parliamentary time for such a bill. </p> <p>The Deputy Prime Ministers will also use his speech to announce that he will accept the conclusions of Lord Cullen's report into the Ladbroke Grove rail disaster when they emerge. </p> <p>The anniversary of the tragedy falls at the beginning of next month. Prescott will also outline in his speech a new series of targets aiming to reduce the numbers of deaths and serious injuries in road accidents. </p> <p>'As far as Cullen goes, without wanting to pre-empt anything, there is a full commitment to implementing what he comes up with at the end of his inquiry,' a Whitehall source said. </p> <p>Any of Cullen's recommendations which require primary legislation can go into the Safety Bill.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Break Up</strong> C4 <br><strong> Sperm Wars</strong> BBC2 <br><strong> Love Is Not Enough</strong> BBC1 <br><strong> My Family</strong> BBC1 </p> <p>On the wall of Graham's parents' house, where he was staying temporarily following the break-up of his marriage to Jane, there was a copy of the couple's 1991 wedding portrait. The camera homed in on Jane's fabulous legs. 'Very pretty girl... Could have been a model... Obviously, that was nine years ago...' said Graham with a tiny sigh of resignation before the shot switched to an unforgiving close-up of an impassive Jane now: arms crossed, eyes tired, not looking much like a model and subjecting herself to the apparently passive and ineffectual ministrations of the family mediation service as she and Graham negotiated the terms of their divorce. </p> <p>If one was being kind, one could say that Graham, anti-hero of <strong> Break Up</strong>, was in the throes of a classic midlife crisis, even though there was an enormous amount of evidence to suggest that he hadn't grown up enough to justify one. Blandly good-looking and tautly muscled, Graham was an aerobics instructor but Jane (rather naively by her own admission) hadn't really thought too much about the fact that her husband spent his working days urging a roomful of Lycra-clad young women to go for the burn, or whatever it is that happens at aerobics classes. For a while she even believed that Graham's new girlfriend had been acquired after their split, though it had only been a few weeks since he'd fled the marital home. Then she found the notes - 'Thank you for the personal services. Love, Me' - hidden in the garage. </p> <p>Graham, patently a bit of a body fascist, was obviously fairly disappointed by the fact that Jane, the mother of his three children, wasn't quite the looker she had been. He had consoled himself, however, by running up close to \u00a320,000 of debt and now, on top of all this, had suddenly acquired a new house. Not a one-bedroom flat, mind, but a whole house, costing more than the family home. </p> <p>As he moved in, he gave us a tour, while his mum vacuumed in the background. 'Do you expect me to live on the street?!' Graham had demanded of Jane. Compromise was clearly not on his agenda, but the maths didn't add up: a reluctantly revealed monthly income of \u00a31,600 wasn't enough to support his wife, three small children, two mortgages and all that debt which, as the mediators pointed out, amounted to \u00a33,400 a month. While Graham insisted that the State pick up the tab for Jane and their kids ('I've paid taxes!'), his wife's restraint was saintly. I wanted to punch his lights out. </p> <p>Wednesday night was good for 'there but for the grace of...' documentaries. At the same time as Jane and Graham were tussling with the horrible banality of their divorce, on BBC2 in <strong> Sperm Wars</strong>, a cocktail waitress called, confusingly, Pamela Reno, from Reno, Nevada, was trying to persuade us that it was perfectly acceptable to harvest the sperm of her dead 19-year-old son, Jeremy (Russian roulette at a party, if you're interested), acquire an egg donor (ideally one of Jeremy's ex-girlfriends, so she could show the putative offspring pictures of 'mommy and daddy together') and a surrogate mother, and create herself a lovely little 'souvenir' grandchild, or preferably two ('I'd like twins!'). </p> <p>This modern gothic horror story was, however, counterbalanced by the slightly less ethically clear-cut tale of the Vernoffs, whose son Bruce had died of an (apparently accidental, though this was a bit vague) overdose after a car crash, and whose wife, Gaby, had been planning to start a family shortly before he died. Here there was at least a loving, close-knit family for the (very much alive and now cutely toddling) result of Bruce's posthumous sperm harvest, but once you start relieving even a happily married - albeit undeniably dead - man of his sperm, where does it end? </p> <p>In the cases of Graham and Pamela it is so very easy easy to judge. They invariably set themselves up and the selective directing and the editing merely helped us despise them, even though one recognises that the 'truth' we are presented with can never be the whole truth. It was also very easy to judge the participants in the week's other big curtain-twitching documentary - the first in the series <strong> Love Is Not Enough</strong>, which follows a handful of British couples through the harrowing year-long process of attempting to adopt a child. </p> <p>Caught up in this particularly sneaky parlour game, I found myself thinking that moneyed and middle-class Mark and Sarah (looking for a Chinese baby and with one Romanian adoption already under their belts) really ought to clear away those three empty morning-after-the-night-before wine bottles from the kitchen table at which little Josh was eating his Rice Krispies while they all waited for the social worker to arrive. And if Linda and Tony seriously thought they could persuade their social worker that the cluttered and claustrophobic spare-room-cum-cupboard in the eaves was really suitable for a new child, then they probably ought to be employed doing makeovers on Changing Rooms . </p> <p>And surely Paula and Al could see that talking about hearing 'voices from God' and belonging to a happy-clappy charismatic church called The Frontline made them appear, in these godless times, more like weird cultists than staunch upholders of Christian values. Nope, on the evidence of the first episode in this series I don't think I'd let any of this lot take on even one of the 7,000 children a year who need adopting - but that was surely the point of the exercise: from the viewer's sofa, this was only a gameshow. Ooh... now there's an idea! </p> <p><strong> My Family</strong> has been touted as the first British sitcom to be created in the collaborative American mode, even including a writer with Seinfeld on his CV. Which is amusing mostly because the result is like an updated Butterflies, with Zoe Wanamaker in the good-mum-bad-cook Wendy Craig role and Robert Lindsay doing a slightly less lugubrious, though no less put-upon version of Geoffrey Palmer's dentist. It is full of those cheery, stagey, wacky one-liners that one can spot several miles away waiting patiently in a drivetime jam on the M25 ('Does the phrase \"pull the other one\" mean anything to you?', 'Ah! You think she's got a sister?' And for toad-in-the-hole sans sausages, try 'toad-en-vacances'... except that these people would never eat toad in the hole any more). </p> <p>My Family is never less than relentlessly and unfashionably middle-class, but while the sofas are even bigger and squashier and the artful arrangement of objets even more contrived than those you'll find in a Judi Denchcom, I still enjoyed it because I loved Butterflies , which sort of attempted to grapple with the rising tide of Seventies feminism in a defi antly British (and therefore utterly woolly and suburban) context. Perhaps future storylines could push the sitcom envelope a wee bit further: adopting Chinese babies, say, or harvesting gold fillings from the bodies of patients who have died under Lindsay's local anaesthetic. That might just about turn today's mild titters into tomorrow's big belly laughs.</p>",

He puts the word around the Black Valley that they're after treasure, though most villagers believe him to be involved in telecommunications and everyone addresses him respectfully as 'Mr Engineer'. </p> <p>It transpires that he's there in connection with a dying woman whose 12-year-old grandson he befriends, but he doesn't approach her directly. The nature of his project isn't disclosed and we never see the colleagues he calls 'my crew' who, we're invited to infer, are filmmakers. The Engineer, for all his urban superiority, is an anxious man and not his own master. He's forever being phoned on his mobile from Tehran. Each time (a running joke that gathers momentum), he hops into his car and makes a tortuous drive to a cemetery on a hill top to receive a clear signal from a mysterious Mrs Godzani in the national capital. Her name inevitably suggests Godot, and The Wind Will Carry Us creates that air of existential unease and spiritual dread we associate with Beckett and Pinter. </p> <p>Nothing much seems to happen, little is explained. But in fact this quiet, labyrinthine village is teeming with life and the Engineer brings everyone together to save a stranger he converses with but never sees, who's trapped in a hole he's digging near the cemetery. There are astonishing images in Kiarostami's film, and odd encounters like the journey the Engineer makes as pillion passenger of an elderly GP who rides around the countryside on his little motorbike admiring the scenery, and blithely confesses to being of little practical use. At the end of this movie, as after an evening with Vladimir and Estragon, you feel you've been on a remarkable odyssey while standing still. This form of realism offers no easy answers, it just points to the unfathomable mystery of life. </p> <p>The week's other film of distinction, Marco Bechis's <b> Garage Olimpo</b>, also comes from a country that has recently suffered under a peculiarly repressive regime, though in this case the malaise is confronted directly. The setting is Buenos Aires in the late 1970s, and the Argentine military junta is rounding up opponents, dissidents and troublemakers, torturing them in subterranean garages, 'vaccinating' them with lethal injections and dumping the bodies from air-force transport planes over the Atlantic. The movie turns upon Maria, an idealistic 18-year-old Franco-Italian who is arrested on suspicion of working with an anti-government organisation. She discovers that one of her interrogator-torturers is the unassuming young man to whom her mother lets a room. This is a quiet, measured movie about the theory and practice of hell, contrasting the orderly, oblivious city, neon-lit by night, sunny by day, with the dark, horrific underground world of the vindictive, exploitative secret police who control both. The film is the more chilling for the way the door is shut when torture and violent acts take place, but we're shown the terrible consequences. </p> <p>In <b> Me, Myself &amp; Irene</b>, the Farrelly Brothers compound the offence of There's Something About Mary without being anything like as funny, and they fail to provide Ren\u00e9e Zellweger with the kind of endearing role they gave Cameron Diaz. On to a comic pursuit thriller (rogue cops seek to eliminate female witness) they've imposed every possible kind of offensive joke, daring us to laugh lest we expose our deficient sense of humour. A man waking up to discover a 10-inch dildo in his rectum is par for this particular course. The better jokes stem from the policeman hero (Jim Carrey) having been cuckolded by a black dwarf, chairman of the Boston branch of Mensa, and having loving black triplets as his brilliant, foul-mouthed sons. Various mental health societies have objected to the Carrey character being identified as a schizophrenic. They have a point. But the movie is really only a comic take on Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or more precisely a homage to The Nutty Professor, the re-working of Stevenson's tale by Carrey's idol Jerry Lewis. </p> <p><b> Play It To the Bone</b> is the poorest picture to date by writer-director Ron Shelton, a former baseball professional who really knows the world of sport. Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas look far too unscathed to be washed-up middleweight boxers driving with their joint girlfriend to Las Vegas to beat the shit out of each other for money and a last shot at the title as a warm-up bout for Mike Tyson. The characters are coarse, but the film itself is coarser, as well as overlong and poorly written. Not a patch on Huston's Fat City. </p> <p><b> Elephant Juice</b> comes from the deviser (Amy Jenkins) and director (Sam Miller) of This Life and is a would-be knowing look at the lives of eight well-heeled, narcissistic Londoners aged around 30 and having trouble with love and commitment. Its seven chapters are prefaced by questions (eg 'Is your sex life a natural expression of love?', 'Where does the pain come from?') which are as witless as the answers. Emmanuelle B\u00e9art as a city high-flier seems as bewildered by what she has to say as by the milieu into which she's been dropped. </p> <p>Worse, but arguably more ambitious, is Terence Gross's<b> Hotel Splendide</b>, an attempt to graft Delicatessen on to Fawlty Towers. Set at a run-down spa hotel on an island off the English coast, it's some sort of allegory about a nation in an advanced state of decay and denial. A strong cast struggles desperately with intractable material. </p> <p>Before the coming of the Beatles, Alun Owen (who scripted A Hard Day's Night) put Liverpool on the map with hard-hitting TV plays like Last Tram to Lime Street, as well as scripting one of the finest British gangster and prison pictures, Joseph Losey's The Criminal. The biggest plus about Jim Doyle's promising debut, <b> Going Off, Big Time</b>, is that it takes us from Mockney London to lowlife Merseyside for its cautionary tale of a decent lad becoming a gangster after serving four desensitising years in jail. Bernard Hill is splendid as an old lag, but the movie, which sets out to be a Merseyside Mean Streets, is uncertain in tone. </p> <p>The British Short Film Festival continues through to Thursday at the Empire Leicester Square with its usual crop of striking movies from all over. Old age and death are the dominant subjects, and I especially commend, because good and representative, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pelle's Des morceaux de ma femme , in which an elderly French man attempts to divest himself of every memory of his late wife and go naked in the world; and Vikki Blanche's The Other Days of Ruby Ray, where an old widowed vicar (the great Norman Kaye) has his faith renewed by a numinous 10-year-old girl in the Australian Outback.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Space Cowboys</strong> (130 mins, PG) Directed by Clint Eastwood; starring Clint Eastwood, James Garner, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland </p> <p> Had Clint Eastwood asked me to devise an SF western that would provide him with an epic role befitting his mature years I'd have suggested a space version of King Lear. </p> <p>As a galactic emperor touched with Alzheimer's, he'd divide his universe between his daughters. Then, as he flits from sphere to sphere with his rowdy entourage, the ungrateful daughters would take away his spacecraft, stranding Clint on a barren planet with a few eccentric courtiers. </p> <p>Inevitably, star wars break out, the good forces led by the rejected good daughter (a strong role for Sondra Locke here) and a family struggle for control of the galaxy ensues. </p> <p>He didn't consult me and instead, presumably influenced by the celebratory return to space made by the 77-year-old John Glenn on the Discovery shuttle two years ago, chose to make Space Cowboys, starring himself in his seventieth year, the 72-year-old James Garner, the 66-year-old Donald Sutherland and the 54-year-old Tommy Lee Jones as a marvellous bunch of superannuated astronauts. </p> <p>It's a hi-tech action comedy-drama, an artful cross between The Right Stuff, Armageddon, The Magnificent Seven and The Sunshine Boys, an entertaining spin on the traditional 'Last Big Mission' yarn. Usually, Hollywood ignores the ages of its increasingly elderly romantic male stars. Here, age becomes the point of the jokes and the pathos. </p> <p>The opening sequence invokes The Right Stuff. In nostalgic black-and-white, a quartet of young air force pilots called the Daedalus team push the envelope over the Californian desert in 1958 in preparation for an expedition into space. </p> <p>But the project is called off. A monkey is sent in their place (anticipating Eastwood's co-starring role with Clyde, the orang-utan in Every Which Way But Loose ) and the USAF hands over its operations to the newly created Nasa. Unlike Daedalus and Icarus, the four never get into orbit. </p> <p>Forty years later, their chance comes again. Ikon, a vital Russian satellite, has gone out of control and must be kept in space. Its outdated guidance system was stolen from Nasa by Soviet spies and the only person capable of supervising the repair job is its designer, retired Colonel Frank Corvin (Clint Eastwood), maverick leader of the Daedalus team. </p> <p>But confronted by his old enemy, devious bureaucrat and wingless eagle Bob Gerson (James Cromwell), he refuses to take on the task without his old Daedalus buddies. Like Yul Brynner putting together his band of gunfighters, Corvin searches out his old mates in their new habitats. </p> <p>The ace navigator, Tank Sullivan (James Garner), has become a Baptist preacher and confers with his God for three seconds before accepting. The incomparable engineer, white-maned amorist Jerry O'Neill (Donald Sutherland), who now designs rollercoasters, needs little pressing. Corvin's reckless rival and former co-pilot, Hawk Hawkins (Tommy Lee Jones), now flying a cropdusting biplane, initially turns the offer down, but it may well be that Jones himself needed persuading to play someone at least a decade older than himself without resort to make-up. </p> <p>The best scenes are to be found in the early stages. The quartet in their leather jackets and shades striding confidently towards the Lyndon Johnson Building at Nasa's Houston headquarters is a glorious sight - men feeling they're needed once again, being given the chance to fulfil a dream they thought had been denied them. 'We've got three weeks to send four old farts into space,' says flight director William Devane, restoring reality, and the quartet's medical testing and flight training are both comic and poignant. </p> <p>They know that if they can't cut it, they'll be replaced by the fit, technically advanced young astronauts who view them with open contempt. But the old guys are in charge of making this picture. They get the best lines and (which is dramatically unfair and seriously weakens a grand movie) the youngsters go largely uncharacterised. The old guys also get the best girls (doctor Blair Brown, scientist Marcia Gay Harden, feisty wife Barbara Babcock), though when Eastwood, having a barroom row with Jones, asks a waitress: 'Which of us would you like to take home?', she replies, quizzically: 'To the retirement home?' </p> <p>The excitement become more conventional when the astronauts are eventually launched into space. Nevertheless, the tensions are well sustained and there are effective surprises and final nods towards Dr Strangelove. It is no surprise, however, that our elderly heroes acquit themselves rather better than the two young astronauts who accompany them on the mission. </p> <p>The nice thing about the movie is that apart from some mildly barbed stuff about the callowness of youth, the mendacity of bureaucrats and the grim legacy of the Soviet Union, it's full of human warmth and good humour. There's no bitterness, no rancour and a merciful absence of triumphalism, sentimentality and flag-waving. Space Cowboys is a movie for those who prefer Budweiser and Jack Daniel's to summer wine.</p>"
