  "<p>Ask yourself a few questions about your boss. Does he or she spend the day enmeshed in meetings and only communicate via email and phone? Is your workplace populated with minions whose sole job seems to be to act as corporate bodyguards, blocking all contact between you and the person you work for?</p> <p>If so, you are working for an invisible boss. Supposedly busy, but in reality scared witless by their own lack of the management skills business gurus preach many bosses are currently becoming more remote than a Tibetan hermit. High-profile bullying and harassment court cases being brought against bosses by their staff make them feel less gregarious. </p> <p>Give it a go yourself. Pick your victim and get going on the phone. You will - I promise - get one of three responses:</p> <p>1. Someone you have never heard of before will tell you they are working from home, off sick or at a conference. </p> <p>2. Their PA will say they are in meetings all day, week or decade.</p> <p>3. You will be answered by voice mail.</p> <p>Assuming your boss has a function, though, you may well find yourself with a genuine need to communicate. Empowerment is all very well but sometimes we all need a little steer from above. So how can you cope when your boss has a habit of doing a Pimpernel? </p> <p>\u0095 Track, but do not attack. Stalk your prey out but without being seen. Check for any routines or rotas. Discover busy times and quieter times and plan to approach him/her during the latter.</p> <p>\u0095 Never plan the accidental meeting in anywhere like the lift or toilet, and then start talking business. This makes them nervous or stressed if they cannot even go for a pee alone. Try to make it feel as though they got talking to you, if possible.</p> <p>\u0095 Never get messages passed on unless this is the boss of bosses, someone so remote and omnipotent that face-to-face communication is unheard of in the company. Having said that, though, do not be too fazed by status. If you need to talk to someone you have every right, whatever their job title.</p> <p>If your boss is still unobtainable, book an appointment to speak with him or her. Make it in person, rather than over the phone. If you cannot get an early appointment, book one anyway for whatever date is available. One colleague of mine was offered the second week in January for an appointment to speak to his chief executive on the phone. His problem would not wait that long but he took the date anyway, just so he could tell the CEO that the system was not working. </p> <p>People avoid moaners and whingers, though. If you get the chance to speak, throw in some positives. So be concise and plan your communication in advance - or the heady excitement of having finally cornered your prey might be too much for you and you will start to babble in tongues. Write notes. </p> <p>Finally, make no more than three major points. Most invisible bosses suffer from ADS ( attention deficiency syndrome) and may become more withdrawn if you drown them with your monologue. And once you have made your points always agree on steps for future action. Summarise by re-stating those steps. If no actions are agreed then your hard work will all have been pointless.</p>",
  "<p>'Show me the money,\" demanded the sportsman of his agent, played by Tom Cruise, in the film Jerry Maguire. Routinely quoted to employers by employees - in our dreams, at least - the line is destined for immortality. But for some, money is a dirty word, too vulgar a subject to talk about. Yet it is one of the main reasons we work at all. And if you're a secretary in search of more of the stuff, the City and West End of London is where you need to be, according to a review carried out by recruitment company Crone Corkill. </p> <p>Surveying the wages of candidates working in Crone Corkill's City, West End and Richmond branches over the first six months of this year, compared with the same period last year, the review shows that junior secretaries are averaging \u00a317,000 with top PAs earning \u00a330,000 to \u00a337,000. They also admit to having placed a director's PA on a salary of \u00a347,000 and a business assistant at \u00a350,000, but those were the exceptions, not the norm, so don't get too excited. </p> <p>So what do we mean when we say City secretaries? \"Traditionally, the City was the finance industry and within one square mile of the Bank of England,\" says director of Crone Corkill Melanie Melrose. \"Now it really has extended, and includes Canary Wharf, and the industries include law, insurance, dot.coms, telecom and property companies. But really, when we talk of the City, we are talking of banking.\" </p> <p>The junior secretary sector has seen the sharpest increase in growth. West End salaries have risen, year on year, by 21%, ranging from \u00a314,000 to \u00a319,000; in the City they have increased by a similarly impressive 18.6%. Increasingly, it is graduates who are entering the market as juniors. But what do they look for? </p> <p>\"We have a higher number of graduates than before and a lot of them take a year out and temp. Not all of them want to go on the milkrounds and become accountants,\" says Melrose. \"Graduates realise that secretarial and administrative positions are a good career option. With keyboard skills, they could be earning a salary of \u00a318,000, which compares favourably with entry positions in other professions.\" </p> <p>Carolyn Asome, a languages graduate from Manchester University, has been temping with Crone Corkill for over a year. \"I've worked for Credit Suisse, First Boston and others, and you have to be very efficient, on the ball, and enthusiastic. Notoriously, banking pays the most. I'm probably earning twice as much in the City as I would working as a waitress,\" she says. </p> <p>And yet still there remains a scarcity of secretaries. \"Our survey reflects a shortage of really good candidates, with good skills and initiative, which is forcing employers to pay more to attract the best,\" says Melrose. So what skills do you need to earn all this cash? Are secretaries in the Smoke really any different from others? \"Technically, no, but you have to make sure your skills are up to scratch. You need to know packages such as Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. </p> <p>\"You also have to be commercially aware. You are entering a very particular culture, so you have to have a 'can do' attitude, be prepared to work very long hours - often you have to work late at a moment's notice. Secretaries who are flexible are the ones who get the most offers,\" says Melrose. </p> <p>So you might not get the time to spend all the money, but it's not just cash that's on offer. Perks for City secretaries can be excellent, too. Packages can include in-house gyms or reduced rates for membership; performance-related bonuses, lavish social events and financial help with purchasing property. Not bad, not bad at all.</p>",
  "<p>She may be traditional down to her oft-repeated felicitations to \"y'all\", but Alabama's Allison Moorer is hardly a typical country woman, and not solely because she is her own lyricist. In a genre marked by mawkish addiction to despair, she and older sister Shelby Lynne understand genuine tragedy. Fourteen years ago, when Moorer was herself 14, her father shot and killed her mother and then himself. Her current album, The Hardest Part, charts a relationship not dissimilar to that of her parents. However, Moorer sings directly of the murderous evening only once, in the harrowing Cold Cold Earth, which she performs alone. Extraordinarily raw and almost too close to home for public airing, when she whispers the \"two daughters he treated so terribly\" line, watching her feels like intruding upon the private grief of those 14 years. </p> <p>Moorer's rich voice has an authentic twang, more Billie Jo Spears than Faith Hill, but with the help of a sympathetic five-piece band she keeps it both country and universally accessible. As with the best of her peers and predecessors, Moorer - black vest, jeans, effective pout - presents her heartbreak in flirtatious fashion. \"Have you got your swollen organ?\" she teases keyboardist Michael Webb. He blushes underneath his beard. </p> <p>When Moorer transports herself into the centre of a song such as No Next Time though, the frisky mood alters. This nasty tale of a betrayed wife taunting her philandering husband with his own excuses is standard country fare, but in these assured hands its naked emotion transcends genre. Similarly the Oscar-nominated A Soft Place to Fall, taken from Robert Redford's flaccid film The Horse Whisperer: again, its lyrical sophistication (\"ask me anything but where I've been\") isn't sacrificed on the altar of porch homily. Is It Worth It, \"a song which makes me feel like my insides are on the outside\", is another divorce saga. Moorer plays the sultry, wounded siren in a manner that would scare the lights out of husband and producer Butch Primm, were he here and not back in Nashville. </p> <p>She can rock out, too. Long Black Train and the anthemic Send Down an Angel roar along like a less stodgy Pretenders, while her glorious wailing on guitarist Will Kimbrough III's broody showcase Don't Have a Gun suggests that if it went belly up today, she would conquer the backing vocalist circuit tomorrow. Surely that will not be necessary.</p>",
  "<p>At least one person a day dies at work in the UK. And no, it's not only in nuclear power stations, or down the few remaining coal mines. It's in regular working environments, mostly as a result of falls. What's more, 2.2m people have to take time off because of work-related health problems, resulting in 13bn working days being lost annually. </p> <p>There's worse news still for recruitment agency workers, who make up a significant proportion of the army of support staff, according to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). \"We have found that recruitment agencies in this country are unclear as to what their health and safety responsibilities are towards workers registered with them,\" explains Frances Gilbert of Bostock Marketing Group, the company that carried out the research for the HSE. \"This means that recruitment agency workers may not receive the same level of health and safety protection as other employees.\" </p> <p>In other words, temps get a raw deal when it comes to staying safe at work. Nobody, after all, seems quite sure if it's the agency or the host employer who is responsible for looking after them. Mel Draper, head of HSE's policy division, argues that \"although most recruitment agencies and host employers claim to exchange information on capabilities, training and health and safety features of the job, the fact remains that a poor level of awareness of health and safety legislation exists.\" </p> <p>As a result, temps may not be issued with safe and comfortable work stations, which are essential in decreasing the risk of ailments including severe back and neck pain and repetitive strain injury (RSI). In addition, they may not be using computers with glare-free screens and adjustable brightness and contrast controls that avoid damaging eye-sight. They may not be warned about fire exits and danger spots around the building, and they may be expected to work in an area surrounded by lethally stacked boxes and cabinets. And, crucially, they may not know at whom to direct their frustration when they find themselves confronted with these situations in an unfamiliar office. </p> <p>Suing a company for damages, now a widely accepted action for any one injured at work if the employer is to blame, is a further grey area for the temp. If they don't know if it's the agency or the hiring employer which is supposed to take reasonable care for their safety - and provide them with safe equipment, plant and premises, adequate supervision and proper training - then they don't know from whom to seek compensation. </p> <p>The HSE's report reveals that around half of all recruitment agencies do not have measures in place to ensure they are fulfilling their health and safety obligations, and that joining a smaller temping agency is particularly risky. In fact, research shows that, whether or not you're a temp, you are twice as likely to be hurt in an industrial accident if you work for a small firm than a large one. According to the Health and Safety Commission (HSC), many smaller businesses \"have greater difficulty understanding their legal duties and are unclear about the action they should take.\" </p> <p>So what's the solution? How can support staff - especially temps - make sure they're safeguarded in the future? According to Belinda Brooke, legal adviser for the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), a good start would be for agencies, host employers and temps themselves to learn the facts about the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. \"In fact,\" she argues, \"we believe most agencies already know them.\" </p> <p>It works like this. There are two types of agencies: those, such as Manpower, where the temp is fully employed by the agency; and the majority, including Adecco, where the temp is engaged by the agency under a \"contract for services\". \"You'll only know which kind you belong to by asking,\" advises Brooke. \"In the first case, it's the agency that is the employer and health and safety is therefore its responsibility. </p> <p>\"In the second case, the responsibility is split. Before you go to any assignment, the agency has a duty to advise you of any accident or health-risk that could occur as a result of the type of work. Say you're doing a copytyping job, you could expect the agency to warn you that there'll be a lot of typing - so if you suffer from RSI, you would have the chance to refuse the job. Additionally, it must tell you who to approach within the host company to inform you about health and safety issues related to the premises.\" </p> <p>In both cases, adds Brooke, the employer has a general duty of care for anybody - even if they are self-employed - who is on their premises, but that is legally \"weaker\" than the Health and Safety at Work Act. \"It's complicated,\" she acknowledges, \"but worth getting your head round so that you can make sure you have minimised all risks before you begin any assignment.\" </p> <p>So complicated has the legislation become, admits the government, that over the past 18 months, it has, through the HSC, been looking at ways to simplify it. Revamping the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 could, for instance, be something of a solution itself. The problem is that the original act presumed that companies would continue directly to employ most of their workforce. It did not envisage large numbers of people being self-employed, part-timers or sub-contractors. And it certainly didn't envisage the fact that the majority of the secretarial sector would be temping. This means that the supply chain among businesses has become complex, once again leaving ambiguity about who is responsible for health and safety. </p> <p>A further way forward for secretarial staff may be to introduce tougher legislation that protects workers from violence at work. According to the HSE, there has been a significant increase in the number of violent attacks by colleagues and clients. And while the British Crime Survey does not have a specific category for workplace violence - making figures hard to come by - it does note \"acquaintance violence\" which accounts for about half of all attacks on men and a third of all attacks on women. An incredible 23% of these incidents involve a customer or client, and around 20% occur at work. </p> <p>\"Receptionists and other secretarial staff who deal with the public may be particularly at risk because they're often the first point of contact for aggressive customers or clients,\" stresses Sarah Simpson, training director for the Suzy Lamplugh Trust. \"There are, in fact, five pieces of legislation relevant to violence at work including, above all, the good old Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. But many employers think health and safety has nothing to do with personal safety. In consequence, a lot don't react until something terrible happens.\" </p> <p>Andrew Pemberton, director of Human Focus, a company helping employers to reduce accidents and health risks, is, however, resolutely positive about the future. \"We have opened the first UK centre aimed solely at helping employees with neck and spinal pain back to normal work duties, and it has been enormously popular. I'm the first to admit that I don't believe that's because companies are increasingly caring towards their staff. I believe it's because they are finally becoming more financially aware of health and safety. </p> <p>\"Health and safety failures cost Great Britain up to \u00a318bn per year. More and more companies are learning this by the day and if that's not a good enough reason to start protecting staff, I don't know what is.\"</p>",
  "<p>Now where were we? Arsenal were going impressively, after wins over Lazio and Manchester United. Aston Villa had taken 10 points from four games to leap up the Premiership table. We expected a feast from two in-form teams. But with some players jaded by two weeks of intense international activity, some rusty from the break, we saw instead a messy match of half-chances poorly finished. </p> <p>It was settled by the one that was taken, Thierry Henry again making it 1-0 to the Arsenal, as he had done against United, if not quite so spectacularly. There was then no way back for Villa, who had played the neater football for much of the match but again lacked cutting edge, especially when one man short after the belated dismissal of Lee Hendrie by a referee who had forgotten to send him off until his oversight was pointed out to him. </p> <p>Rob Harris was the ref who allowed Tranmere Rovers to play with 11 men in an FA Cup tie last season after sending one wild Rover off. Yesterday he brandished a second yellow card at Hendrie but it took Arsenal's Gilles Grimandi to remind him as Hendrie lined up in a wall to face the free-kick. The first offence, for kicking the ball away, had preceded the second, pulling back Robert Pires, by just seven minutes. Mr Harris appears to have the memory of a goldfish. 'He's a prat, quite frankly,' said the Villa manager John Gregory, admirably of his player rather than the referee, though. </p> <p>It was all a little harsh on Villa ultimately, though it pointed up the difference between the very top teams of the Premiership and the sides who aspire to be. In Paul Merson, back on the ground where he plied his trade for 12 years, Villa have a player capable of moments of ingenuity but little out of the ordinary as support in the attacking third of the pitch. David Ginola remains injured and short of match fitness. </p> <p>By contrast, Arsenal have half a dozen - two of them even starting on the bench in Sylvain Wiltord and Kanu, along with the rested Martin Keown - so that they always look able to turn a match in which they are not at their most fluent. </p> <p>They had an early chance, David James saving brilliantly with one hand at his near post a shot by Dennis Bergkamp, but thereafter Ian Taylor, Merson and Hendrie assumed control of midfield, where Patrick Vieira, after his five-match suspension, looked off the pace. </p> <p>Duly, Villa carved out some reasonable opportunities. Gareth Southgate, back in towering form for his club in his right position, as one tackle on Henry in full flight showed, twice tested David Seaman, the goalkeeper saving his volley with his legs before tipping away a shot across goal after Southgate had met Merson's free-kick. </p> <p>With Villa protecting possession well and passing the ball accurately, Arsenal were denied the chance to do damage by sending Henry clear, Bergkamp being closed down quickly when on the ball. Frustrated, they were forced to resort to long shots, James clutching to his midriff one 30-yarder by Silvinho. </p> <p>Villa needed to score in this purple patch and one sensed they could be made to pay for not doing so. The feeling grew in the second half when Hendrie shot lamely across goal after Julian Joachim had slipped him through and Tay lor missed his kick on the six-yard line. </p> <p>And so it happened. Pires pushed the ball forward to Henry in the inside-right channel and he swivelled to send a low shot through Alpay's legs and into James's far corner. After that, and Hendrie's delayed red card, it was clear there would be only one winner. </p> <p>It could, too, have been by a bigger margin as Villa left gaps chasing the game. Henry drove just wide, Bergkamp saw his shot clipped over James cleared off the line by Southgate, and Wiltord mis-kicked from 10 yards. </p> <p>'You look at their bench and think, \"We can't match that\",' lamented Gregory. The answer to the lack of finishing power, he said, is to 'go out and spend money. We can't do that'. It does ignore, however, the fact that he has spent considerably on a clutch of average players rather than invested it in one quality striker. </p> <p>Arsenal, through Wenger's acumen, certainly have one, which is one of the reasons they are unbeaten since the first day of the season, with a 100 per cent home record to boot. Even jaded, 15 of their squad having been on international duty, they can eke out results when the spectacular eludes them.</p>",
  "<p>A week after Kevin Keegan resigned from his job as England coach, Tottenham's supporters were urging their manager, George Graham, to do the same following this latest away defeat, their fourth in five league games. </p> <p>Fans lived up to their pre-match promise of protests against Graham and the club's chairman Alan Sugar, and the early light-hearted chants of 'Graham for England' quickly turned to more angry calls by half-time, with Spurs 2-0 down to a Coventry team that had not previously won at home in the league. </p> <p>Although Spurs improved and scored early in the second-half, they still could not overcome a side reduced to 10 men when Carlton Palmer was sent off in the 71st minute for a violent kick at Chris Perry in an off-the-ball incident. </p> <p>Palmer may face disciplinary action from the FA after having to be pulled away from referee Peter Jones by fellow players, but both managers agreed he deserved his fate. </p> <p>'I'm a big fan of his but he had to go - you can't defend that sort of thing,' said Gordon Strachan. 'I was watching golf all morning but I never saw as good a swing as that - I expected Perry to be pitched out of the ground.' </p> <p>Graham, meanwhile, bemoaned the fact that the dismissal gave Coventry renewed spirit just as Tottenham threatened to equalise. 'The referee got it spot on, but I wish the sending-off hadn't happened because we were playing better against 11 men than we did against 10. They got players behind the ball and made it very difficult.' </p> <p>Tottenham's defence was all at sea during the first half. Graham is notorious for creating tight defensive units, but he needs better raw material than he has here. Ramon Vega is no substitute for the injured Sol Campbell, while former Wimbledon pair Ben Thatcher and Chris Perry are out of form. To make it worse, the players in front of them - Tim Sherwood and Steffen Freund - are playing increasingly poorly, leaving Tottenham as soft-centred as a marshmallow. </p> <p>'We're not solid at the back, which is not like my teams,' said Graham. 'We look good going forward but we keep giving soft goals away, and you can't give a Premiership side a two-goal start away from home and expect a result.' </p> <p>The problems started in the 12th minute when Thatcher went AWOL at left-back, allowing John Aloisi time and space to control a crossfield pass, cut in from the right and unleash a terrific left-footed shot into the top corner of goal. Worse was to come 14 minutes later when Ramon Vega allowed Craig Bellamy to take the ball off him inside the penalty area and square it across goal for John Eustace to fire home a simple goal. </p> <p>Spurs started the second half more strongly and pulled a goal back quickly when Richard Shaw's slip allowed Oyvind Leonhardsen to put Sergei Rebrov through. Tim Sherwood then headed against the bar in stoppage time, but Coventry hung on for a rare home win to leave Graham hoping Campbell makes a quick recovery.</p>",
  "<p>For a nation on its knees barely 10 years ago, Lebanon has undergone a remarkable recovery from the ravages of a 15-year civil war. And in the sporting arena, too, this once benighted country is now making impressive progress. </p> <p>As tension in the Middle East threatened to spiral out of control in Israel last week - and with a major flashpoint a mere 100 miles away on his southern border - the Lebanese president, Emile Lahoud, welcomed Fifa's high command, including president Sepp Blatter, to the start in Beirut of Asia's premier football tournament, the 12-nation twelfth Asian Cup. </p> <p>The opening ceremony at Sports City - rebuilt after its 1982 destruction by Israeli bombers - may not have boasted the technical wizardry of the Sydney Olympics, but as a celebration of a nation's ability to overcome adversity it was unrivalled. </p> <p>Security for the event verged on the paranoid. Four hours before Lahoud's arrival, hundreds of soldiers set up a cordon a kilometre from the stadium. Spectators and journalists were subjected to searches of clothes, bags and even pen tops. In the VIP area, Fifa officials and Lahoud sat nervously behind bulletproof screens surrounded by soldiers as army helicopters circled overhead. </p> <p>But the Lebanese crowd had cause to wave their national flags with extra vigour to toast a hat-trick of sports successes that is the envy of its oil-rich neighbours. In addition to staging the Cup, Lebanon is also poised to become the first Middle Eastern country to host the world rally championship and shortly the Lebanese rugby league side travel to Britain for the World Cup. </p> <p>But it is the Asian Cup that represents the biggest coup and offers this beautiful country the chance to establish itself again on the tourist map through sport, even though it has no professional teams. </p> <p>The government hopes the three top-class stadiums in Beirut and newly built, 25,000-seater venues in the Mediterranean towns of Saida and Tripoli, all with running tracks, will attract more events. </p> <p>'The Asian Cup is the biggest event this country will ever host,' the sports minister, Mohammed Yousef Baydoun, said. 'For each activity, the infrastructure is a must. If you don't have an opera house you can't have a symphony orchestra. </p> <p>'It is very important for Lebanon to have hosted this event, but the real meaning lies in the billions of people in Asia and other continents who will be following the games on television. </p> <p>'They will see another Lebanon from what they were used to between 1975-90. The word \"Lebanisation\" entered the dictionary with the meaning of a trou bled country in civil war. But, with this event, the word may now stand for stability, security and a chance of prosperity.' </p> <p>Lebanon could not have done it without the support of their Arabic neighbours, who backed the 1996 bid to stage the tournament - defeating the highly rated bid from China. </p> <p>Fifa executive committee member Mohamed bin Hamman of Qatar headed a campaign supported by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates, who all argued that Lebanon would be the politically correct choice considering all they had overcome. </p> <p>The Asian Football Confederation overcame financial constraints applied when a new government halved investment in the tournament to around \u00a318.5 million. Then on the eve of the tournament, as the Middle East crisis deepened, the AFC had to plead with teams not to pull out as Israeli fighter jets screeched over Beirut's concrete skyline. </p> <p>In an inauspicious start to the tournament, the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation's coverage of the opening game between Iraq and Thailand - watched live by just a few hundred Palestinians supporting Iraq in the 25,000-seater Saida stadium - was interrupted to broadcast news of the lynching of two Israelis in Ramallah. Then a power cut at Sports City plunged the crowd into darkness as the hosts prepared to play Iran. </p> <p>As Western media threatened to evacuate journalists, the government was eager to dampen fears, claiming the tournament was not a target. Baydoun said: 'This is not a Lebanese event - it is an Asian event. I can't see Israel doing anything as teams such as China, Japan and Korea are simply not targets.' </p> <p>Whether Lebanon's coup in staging the event can be matched by surprises on the pitch is a matter of intense local speculation, but realists tip Japan and reigning champions Saudi Arabi - both in Group C - to contest the 29 October final. </p> <p>If England are forced to attempt World Cup qualification through the play-offs then they are almost certain to face one of the 12 nations taking part in the Asian Cup whose standard has improved in recent years through lessons learned in Europe by players such as a trio of Iranians in the Bundesliga, AS Roma's Hidetoshi Nakata (Japan), Charlton's Karim Bagheri (Iran) and Sami Al Jaber (Saudi Arabia). </p> <p>Lebanon will almost certainly not be among the contenders. They have never before qualified for the Asian Cup and lost their opening game 4-0 to Iran, but still have a chance of going to the quarter-finals if they finish ahead of Thailand. </p> <p>Recently, the host nation have gone from rank outsiders to dark horses under the charge of Croatian Joseb Scoblar, a former Olympique Marseille goalscoring hero. His quest has been boosted by a \u00a3625,000 handout from the Lebanese FA and his search for a star has yielded expatriate Mohamed (Michael) Reda from Australia and Brazil's Malteron Barana. </p> <p>Relaxing the eligibility rules is not unique among the 12 nations. It is, though, an approach that Lebanon has adopted with great success in establishing a rugby league side who play under the national flag but is unknown even to the sports minister in its native country. </p> <p>The side for the Lincoln World Cup, starting in the Britain later this month, will be in a group with Wales, New Zealand and the Cook Islands. They are all Australian expatriates and have yet to play on home soil.</p>",
  "<p>Peter Taylor's rapidly rising managerial stock and Leicester City's first visit to the top of the league in 37 years were put into perspective by Teddy Sheringham's sixth and seventh goals of the season, which lifted a barely-recognisable Manchester United into a more familiar position at the top of the Premiership. </p> <p>'No complaints - they are more experienced at big games than we are,' Taylor said. Prior to this game Leicester had conceded only two goals all season, though 34-year-old Sheringham could easily have had a hat-trick, shooting over in the second half and going close with a header from a corner before coming off after 70 minutes. The player so mystifyingly withdrawn in Helsinki also played his usual supporting role, most notably in setting up Dwight Yorke for a shot which brought the save of the game from Tim Flowers. 'He's having a great season,' Sir Alex Ferguson said. 'I only brought him off because he has a slight calf strain and I want him for PSV on Wednesday' </p> <p>Considering Ole Gunnar Solskjaer added a third in stoppage time, City must have been glad they were playing only half the champions. Andy Cole, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs were rested, but the player United missed most was the injured David Beckham. Suddenly the visitors needed two or three passes to transfer the ball across the pitch instead of just the one, and too many failed to find intended targets. </p> <p>The home side were guilty of the same offence in a scrappy and forgettable first half-hour, and would ordinarily have been punished. But when Matt Elliott leant on Quinton Fortune to give away a free-kick on the edge of the penalty area, there was no Beckham to bend a shot over the wall and consequently little danger. Leicester did better with one of their own midway through the half, when Neil Lennon's free-kick found Gary Rowett at the far post. But he missed from close range with a side-foot volley. </p> <p>That was as close as Leicester came before half-time, by which stage they were grateful to be just one goal down. Their defensive concentration wavered in the 36th minute when Sheringham rose in front of Rowett to glance in Denis Irwin's cross for the breakthrough, then three minutes later Solskjaer supplied a low centre which Fortune was only inches from turning in. </p> <p>Leicester had a couple of chances to equalise right at the start of the second half, but Rowett hit the side netting and Darren Eadie's weakly-hit effort was smothered by Fabien Barthez. Leicester had to chase the game and they were hit by a classic United counter-attack. Leicester claimed a penalty when Wes Brown and Robbie Savage went for the same ball, but though the United player made contact with the man, he could not possibly have predicted Savage's arrival and Paul Durkin's corner verdict was probably correct. Predictably Leicester sent Elliott and Co forward, only to be caught when Fortune raced 60 yards almost unchallenged to supply Roy Keane. His first effort was blocked, but he found Irwin, and Sheringham pounced again when Tim Flowers failed to hold the Irishman's thunderous drive. </p> <p>Giggs came on for the last 20 minutes, in time to see Flowers fingertip a Solskjaer header over the bar and Nicky Butt hit a post, though Leicester refused to give up and could have had something out of the game with better finishing in the final minutes. Savage shot wide when Barthez was caught out of his ground, but when Richard Cresswell rounded the goalkeeper from Lennon's defence-splitting pass in the 81st minute, there was less excuse for the substitute missing an empty net. </p> <p>There was very little chance of Solskjaer missing when Yorke gave him an opportunity in the closing seconds. Leicester will need to get sharper if they are really going to challenge for honours, especially as they don't have Beckham, Cole and Scholes to come back. </p> <p>'I was criticised for my last selection against PSV, and it would have been the same had we lost here,' Ferguson said. 'But there were 10 internationals in that team and I have to trust them. We have PSV on Wednesday then Leeds on Saturday. It's a hectic programme for us.'</p>",

  "Next Saturday, 81 senior members of the Scottish Labour Party will convene at Viewforth, the baronial-style headquarters of Stirling council. There, in the shadow of Stirling Castle, the 53 MSPs and 27 members of the party's Scottish executive will deal with one item of business: the election of Donald Dewar's successor as party leader and First Minister of Scotland. <p>It is a near certainty that two candidates - Henry McLeish, the Enterprise Minister, and Jack McConnell, the Finance Minister - will be nominated from the floor. But whichever man emerges from that room as the victor, one outcome is guaranteed. The tragic events of last week mean the United Kingdom is about to experience the most profound shift in its constitutional settlement since the Scots voted to establish the Holyrood Parliament in 1997. </p> <p>'Donald's death is going to have a huge impact on the relationship between Edinburgh and London,' said one senior Labour MP at Westminster. 'You would have to be an idiot not to believe it is now a very different game.' </p> <p>At 12.18pm last Wednesday, the moment Dewar was pronounced dead, the whole of the UK, not only Scotland, entered uncharted and perilous constitutional waters. While Dewar was at the helm, the transition to devolved government had been relatively smooth and unthreatening. With his Westminster pedigree and Cabinet big-hitter status, he formed the crucial bridge between the old, unitary UK and the new, devolved system. </p> <p>In Scotland, he was respected as the driving force behind change; in Downing Street, he was trusted as the safe pair of hands to keep that change firmly anchored in the wider Labour vision of Britain. Open conflict between Holyrood and Westminster has been almost non-existent. But with Dewar's passing, the realities of dividing power between two different parliaments will quickly become apparent. </p> <p>For whoever takes over from Dewar will immediately be confronted with the unenviable task of moving the Parliament out from beneath the late First Minister's shadow. To do so, they will almost certainly have to adopt a more nationalistic agenda. </p> <p>According to recent polls, fewer than one in four Scots want independence, while more than half support devolution. But at the same time, the SNP has established a fairly solid lead over Labour when it comes to Holyrood voting intentions. The implication is clear: voters might not want to break up the UK but they want a Scottish Executive ready to rough it up with Downing Street. </p> <p>'The idea that the British state has ever been homogeneous is flawed, but never more so than now,' said James Mitchell, professor of politics at Strathclyde University. 'The real test of devolution was always going to come post-Dewar, and we are now moving into a much more realistic phase for the Scottish Parliament. </p> <p>'Without Dewar, it is going to have to stand up, establish itself and work.' </p> <p>So McLeish or McConnell will have to be prepared to break away from the path dictated by London party policy, a task that may come more naturally to McConnell. He was a founder of the Scottish Labour Action group in the 1980s and represented Labour on the Constitutional Convention. McLeish, by contrast, was a Westminster MP for 13 years, during which time he served as a UK Minister. But even he will want to start thumping a more overtly Scottish tub if he wins. One minefield the new First Minister will almost certainly have to cross involves the question of greater powers for Holyrood, in particular over raising its own finances. </p> <p>More importantly, Dewar's successor will have to be seen to secure a few victories against London. And that may create further problems for Labour in Scotland. There are fears in some quarters that neither man has the stature to take on Downing Street over a major issue of policy and win. 'The relationship between London and Edinburgh is going to be much more fluid,' said Mitchell. 'Dewar was somebody who could go to Blair, if not as an equal, then damn near it, and the loss of somebody who was such a big player on the British field is going to have a serious effect. Dewar was able to smooth things over, and none of the potential candidates is going to be able to do that.' </p> <p>Some leading Labour MSPs agree. One told The Observer : 'Downing Street will be concerned because Tony Blair knew Donald well and so did Gordon Brown. Whatever relationship they have with whoever takes over will not be the same.' </p> <p>All this will make life difficult for Downing Street. The movement of power away from London fits in with Blair's philosophical support for decentralisation. But it runs counter to his centralising instincts that the 'only way to get things done' is for him and his staff to get involved. He has had to learn, from the debacle of Ken Livingstone's successful campaign to be Mayor of London to the mess over Alun Michael in Wales, that devolving power means losing power. </p> <p>In an interview with The Observer in the spring, he admitted that he had to learn to let go. </p> <p>That decision will be tested now. Much like Margaret Thatcher, Blair has never really 'got' Scotland. He left it to the likes of Dewar, one of the few people he felt politically in awe of. Now he no longer has that luxury. 'The best way to describe it is that devolution is a big juggernaut Blair could live with so long as Donald was driving,' said a senior Scottish Labour MP. 'He knew its path would be predictable and it would only really have one gear. But now the fear is the juggernaut will run out of control.' </p> <p>A senior Labour Party figure with close connections to Downing Street said Blair was 'totally relaxed' about leaving the decision to Scotland. Downing Street has poured cold water on claims it intended to parachute in a senior Cabinet figure - names mooted included that of Alistair Darling, the Social Security Secretary, and John Reid, the Scottish Secretary - to take Dewar's old job. </p> <p>The fact is the potential Scottish front-runners do not fill Blair with the dread with which he greeted the news of Livingstone running for London and Rhodri Morgan running for Wales. A Downing Street source said a decision had been taken that Scotland and Wales should be left to their own devices. </p> <p>Many in Scotland are not convinced by these protestations. 'Tony Blair's problem is he doesn't have much understanding of the rest of the UK, which is surprising given that he spent time at school in Edinburgh,' said Mitchell. 'He has devolved institutions, but he still has a unitary state mindset.' </p> <p>Even taking a back seat may turn out to be a dangerous strategy. Blair, if his majority is cut drastically at the next election, will still be relying on Westminster MPs from north of the border to keep him in power. If Labour at Holyrood suffers a meltdown, there would be a knock-on effect on the UK-wide elections. </p> <p>That is why Blair will ensure Gordon Brown has a key role. The Chancellor, who enjoys enormous influence in Scotland, will step in to ensure the handover is smooth. 'Nobody with an English accent in Downing Street will get involved in this, but Brown will still be pulling strings,' said a Scottish MP. </p> <p>The potential pitfalls of this tactic were already emerging within 36 hours of Dewar's death. Supporters of McLeish were spinning that Brown had endorsed their man's bid to be anointed as party leader without a contest in the interests of party unity. The reaction from other Labour politicians and the Scottish media was predictable outrage. Yet again, Downing Street was implicated in a botched attempt to stitch up the contest. </p> <p>But the implications of Dewar's death are not limited to the Executive benches. Three weeks ago, the SNP's own big-hitting frontman, Alex Salmond, stepped aside after 10 years at the helm. </p> <p>The SNP, too, is adjusting to having a new, relatively inexperienced and untested leader in John Swinney. 'We used to have two real heavyweights slugging it out,' one MSP said last week. 'Now it is going to be two featherweights.' </p> <p>And if the new First Minister does pull off a few victories against London, the nationalists may well see their opinion poll leads evaporate. 'It is just too early to say what sort of effect this will have on the Parliament and on our strategy,' said Swinney, who was able to take on Dewar at question time only once since being installed as leader. </p> <p>'Obviously, I had not expected to be facing a new Labour leader this quickly, although I thought there was a possibility there would be a new one by the time of the Scottish general election in 2004. The one thing I would say is that political culture is shaped by people and the way people interrelate within institutions.' In the next few months, Scotland and the rest of the UK will find out how deep that change will run.</p>",
  "<p>As the ferry steams out of the tiny New England harbour of Wood's Hole, it takes less than an hour's sailing through the choppy Atlantic waters to have a first sight of the island of Martha's Vineyard, which along with its neighbour, Nantucket, is one of the most sought-after holiday destinations in North America. These islands have hardly changed since the first colonial settlers arrived 350 years ago, the architecture preserved, the natural landscapes protected from any kind of development. </p> <p>These wild, out-of-the-way isles adapt to the seasons like chameleons. In spring and autumn they are peaceful, perfect for walking and cycling through wetlands and miles of silvery beaches and sandy dunes. There will be plenty of room at the picturesque 'country inns', refined guesthouses oozing traditional New England style, generous hospitality and attractive prices. There is never any problem booking a table at gourmet restaurants, and this is a great time for being casual, with nothing better than a famous 'clambake' at the beach, a feast of locally-caught clams, mussels and lobsters. </p> <p>In midsummer the islands are transformed into an exclusive playground for the rich and famous. Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket are the long-time vacation home of the Kennedys and more recently the favourite escape for Bill Clinton and his family, and in July and August, half of Hollywood - from Sylvester Stallone and Dustin Hoffman, to Sharon Stone and Cameron Diaz - descends. There is a price to pay for rubbing shoulders with movie stars at the bar of the renowned Black Dog Tavern, or waiting in line next to a famous rock singer to choose an exotic sorbet at Mad Martha's ice cream parlour. </p> <p>The population of the islands grows 10-fold in summer, accommodation rates double, and suddenly everyone is vying to get dinner reservations at exclusive dining spots such as L'Etoile on Martha's Vineyard or the Chanticleer in Nantucket, where the bill will come to a lot more than one for the clambake. Whenever you decide to visit - and the islands are ideally situated between New York and Boston - a detour takes you to a different world, a different pace of life, where there's no crime, no traffic lights, no stress, and just lots of laid-back entertain ment, with regular music, art and cinema festivals, farmers markets, bargain antique stores, and village fairs. </p> <p>Outside the peak summer period, hotels on the island offer deals - lower midweek prices, large off-season discounts. Try to negotiate the best price when making a reservation. Although you will discover some of the most luxurious 'country inns' in the US, there is a range of reasonably priced accommodation too. There are few modern hotels thanks to a strict environmental policy: the historical eighteenth and nineteenth-century clapboard wooden houses have been renovated for today's visitor. </p> <p>Here are some addresses to suit different pockets. The prices quoted are for a double room, from low to high season. Most include a traditional American breakfast, so large you can usually forget about lunch.

  "<b> Philip McQueen (\u00a350,000)</b> <br> 43, divorced, service manager of pharmaceuticals company, lives in Manchester When Philip McQueen was divorced last year, he banked \u00a316,000 - his share of the profit from the sale of the marital home. In less than 12 months, he'd spent it all, along with his regular salary, on going out, clothes, records, books, and holidays. Especially holidays. 'I've never saved money, and in the past 10 years there's never been a single month when I haven't been overdrawn. I just believe \u00ba \u00aa that it's there to be spent. But it would be true to say that I went even more overboard than usual last year. I was fairly miserable, so I spent money on trying to feel better. To a certain extent it worked.' <p>Since his divorce, Philip has rented a two-bedroom flat in the middle of Manchester, which costs \u00a3700 a month. 'I spend about \u00a3100 on petrol, \u00a338 monthly gym membership, \u00a330-40 on records, and the same again for books and magazines.' Food isn't a big priority. 'I spend about \u00a33 a day for a lunch from Marks &amp; Spencer, and maybe \u00a330-40 a week on the rest.' But clothes are important. 'I buy them all the time, and I don't like cheap clothes. If a shirt is \u00a3150, and I like it, I'll have it. I go to the gym all the time, so I have a new pair of trainers every other month at about \u00a370 a time.'</p> <p>Sport is his passion. 'I'm a season-ticket holder at Burnley which is \u00a3320. Plus another \u00a31,000 for away games over the season, including petrol. I love ice hockey and go to see Manchester Storm as often as possible. I go about 25 times in a season, which costs about \u00a3400.'</p> <p>He doesn't save. 'Every now and again I feel guilty about that. I set up a standing order to pay \u00a3350 a month into a high interest savings account. But when I get to \u00a3900 I think: \"Great. That's enough for a skiing holiday.\"' Holidays take a large, regular chunk of his income. 'Three a year, at least. Two skiing trips, which I love, and at least one visit to the US.' The rest goes on socialising and trying to make a dent in his \u00a38,000 Visa bill. </p> <p>Life, Philip believes, is for living. And money is for spending. 'If I had a family, I'd have to behave differently, but I don't, so I don't see that it's a problem. My dad's generation would have scrimped and saved - had half a pint instead of a pint in the pub, or whatever. But where does all that denial and sacrifice get you? An extra 50 quid in the bank when you die.'</p> <p> <b>Nicola Evans (\u00a360,000)</b><br> 31, single, IT service delivery manager, lives in Manchester</p> <p>Nicola Evans's father spent 38 years working for one company - a prospect that seems Jurassically outmoded in her world. At the age of 31, she has already worked for five major companies - in London, in Manchester, and 18 months in Belgium - in her chosen field of information technology. That's the way it works.</p> <p>'I didn't plan this. Every time I join somewhere, I hope that it's going to be forever, but everybody moves around in IT. It's not just about money. I have to love what I do - I've actually taken a pay cut for a job I really wanted.' As well as moving jobs, she travels a lot even when she's settled at one place, and when she's not travelling she puts in long hours. 'It's a work-hard, play-hard life.' It's also an earn-big life - Nicola's salary has bought her a flat in London's Docklands, worth around \u00a3200, which she rents out, and a three-bedroom detached house in Manchester worth \u00a3120k. The rental income in London means that the flat pays for itself. Once she's paid the mortgage on her house, she spends the rest of her monthly salary. </p> <p>'I don't save, apart from the investment in the properties. Not a penny. I just can't.'</p> <p>Nicola is part of a new wave of entirely different householders - the young, affluent single who delay or decide against marriage and family life and buy houses to live in by themselves. Paul Webley has studied attitudes to money across different countries, and he notes that Britain, like the USA, is a very individualistic society. 'In Italy, young people who aren't married tend to stay in the family home. Our singles move out and live by themselves. We're very independent, which has a big effect on the way we live and spend our money in lots of ways.'</p> <p>One effect is that nobody young, single and well off wants to sit in their house by themselves every night. So Nicola goes out. About \u00a3200 per week of her income is spent on socialising. 'I'm out and about five nights a week. I go to bars and restaurants with friends. I spend freely, but I'm not madly extravagant. It galls me to pay more just because the restaurant has a flash name. But then sometimes I'll splash out on a really good bottle of wine.' For her 30th birthday, she hired Old Trafford football club and threw a party for 120 people at \u00a312 a head. 'I just thought - why not?' She's not a label queen - jeans and jumpers are as good at it gets at weekends, but she likes to dress well for work. 'I'll spend up to \u00a3500 on a suit.' </p> <p>Like all high earners, Nicola pays for her time with money. 'I have a lady who does my ironing for \u00a315 a week, and a gardener who costs me \u00a312 a fortnight.' She drives a soft-top Saab - worth about \u00a325,000, which the company buys, but which costs her \u00a36,000 a year in tax, plus 'God knows how much in petrol - I don't even want to think about it.' Most weekends, she drives to London or Bedfordshire, where her family lives. Her other big expense is holidays. 'As many and as often as I can. I'm spending a month in Thailand and Australia at Christmas.' </p> <p>In many ways, it sounds like a model of new economy living. 'In some ways it is, but I can't work at this level, earning this much money, forever. One day I want a family, and then this will have to stop. I'm enjoying it while it lasts. But one of the reasons I'm still single is because of how much I've put into work, and in the end no salary is enough to replace a good relationship and a family.' She knows how hard it will be to downgrade her lifestyle. 'But I've learned from some of the men I work with. They get the big salary and then they get trapped into having to earn at that level. They don't see their kids; their marriages suffer. I don't want it to happen to me.'</p> <p> <b>Paul Gattaora (\u00a3100,000)</b><br> 32, married, headhunter with two children, lives in Buckinghamshire</p> <p>Paul Webley's description of family-centred cultures and their differing attitudes to money is embodied in Paul Gattaora. An Asian man, he spent his childhood weekends and holidays working in his Dad's garage, or in the family shop. 'It taught me discipline and a good work ethic. It's just the Asian way.' He skipped university in favour of 'getting out there into the real world', and had a very successful career in magazine sales before starting his own business - the IT division of Portfolio Recruitment at Stockley Park. 'I got flash out of my system young. </p> <p>I wore the labels and drove the cars, all of that. But I was more or less over it by the time I was in my mid twenties.' These days he spends his money on his family house, where he lives with his wife, children and mother. 'That takes about 50 per cent of my regular income, and I don't mind that at all.'</p> <p>A good chunk of the remaining 50 per cent is also spent on the house. At the moment he's having a conservatory built. 'It's costing about \u00a335,000, without all the finishing off. I've had to order some tiles from France especially.' He never minds, he says, paying for quality. 'Something beautiful, hand-made and one-off? No problem. A great bottle of wine? I'll spend the money with pleasure. What I resent is the \u00a3200 a week we get through in Tesco. Basics in Britain are so overpriced. And don't even get me started on petrol.' The rest of his money goes on clothes - 'I'm not bothered about labels so much, but I have my suits made for work' - and, when he can find the time, on meals out with his wife and family. And, of course, on his pension. 'I've been building that up since I was 21. I've always planned ahead. It will give me a good income from the age of about 50.'</p> <p>Paul works very long hours: '16-hour days are common, and it's pretty much 24/7.' It's for money, of course, but mainly it's for himself. 'I always wanted my own business. I suppose it's in the blood. I'd done well in sales and I turned 30 and thought - right time for me. It's about self-esteem and self-determination.' The financial rewards are high, but he doesn't waste money. 'I don't spoil the kids or buy flash cars - I've got an old Jeep. I won't scrimp on quality, but I know the value of money, and how hard I work for it.' </p> <p>He's playing a long game. 'I don't think anyone could work at this pace and level for too long without keeling over and dying. The plan is to give it my all until I'm 40, make my money, and get out. I'll have paid off the mortgage, got the children sorted out. Then I'll open my own scrap-metal dealership and wear overalls, like my dad. That wouldn't pay me enough to do it now, but that's what I'd love. I'll be the ultimate 21st-century scrap merchant with my own website, selling all around the world!' And he won't miss the big money. 'I'll be fine by then. You should never chase money. If you do, it always eludes you. It has to be a consequence of your work and your life, not your guiding principle.'</p> <p> <b>David Cooper (\u00a31 million)</b><br> 58, married, commercial lawyer with four children and three step-children, lives in London</p> <p>David Cooper is famous for his big income and his enviable lifestyle. Home is a big house in Belgravia. 'It's worth about \u00a38 million. There's no point having a repayment mortgage on that kind of sum, so it's interest only.' The house is decorated with his collection of beautiful antiques, fine rugs and original paintings. He drives an Aston Martin, but there's several other equally juicy motor cars in his collection. His suits are bespoke, his shoes hand-made. There's another flat in Eaton Square. He drinks only good wine, and eats at only the best restaurants.</p> <p>His friends tend to be his clients, rich men like the biotech entrepreneur Chris Evans, or the late Matthew Harding. But he'd rather not talk about all of that. 'Not because I don't like talking about money in the British way, but because I'm bored with it. It's my own fault. I've spent years amusing myself by portraying myself as this big earning lawyer, but the truth is - and I know people won't believe this - I've never really been all that bothered about the money.'</p> <p>I believe him. David Cooper is a totally self-made man, having grown up as a Jewish working-class boy in Manchester. His father was a market stall trader. David was bright, and studied law at Birmingham but, more importantly, he was driven. </p> <p>In his early years, earning big was 'part of the game. I needed to get it just to show that I could and get it out of my system.' But the real point of it all has always been winning. 'I love what I do. I love the competition, and the challenges. I love meeting clients, mixing with all kinds of people. And that is what matters long after you've made all the money.' Paul Webley believes that money is a side issue for the very wealthy. 'There are lots of people with more money than they could spend in several lifetimes, still working as hard as ever. Achievement is a human impulse, and some people just have it to a very great degree.'</p> <p>His salary isn't the whole story. 'I don't think I could actually sustain my current lifestyle on that.' His 'real money' comes from business interests and investments. </p> <p>'I spend most of it on the mortgage and pensions, and over the years on building up the art and antiques collection. But I'm sick of that now. Past a certain point money becomes a burden. I can't go on holiday unless I hire house sitters because of the insurance. So much time is spent maintaining and administrating big sums of money or valuable things. I've lost my spontaneity.' He dreams of downshifting - not from work, which he still loves, but from his fabulous lifestyle. 'I'd rather like a smaller flat in Eaton Square. I'd fill it with Habitat furniture and leave all the doors unlocked. If somebody came and nicked it. I wouldn't care. I'd just buy the whole lot again the next day.'</p> <p>In spite of his wealth, David Cooper would not describe himself as financially secure. 'I am, of course, but that's not the same as feeling it. Every now and again I have a minor anxiety attack. Suppose the bottom fell out of the housing market completely? And if it did, the antiques market would follow suit. And then suppose that inflation ran riot, like in the days of Nazi Germany? It could happen. It's my background. I know that you can never really say: 'this is it. Now I'm safe.'</p> <p>David still insists on value for money. </p> <p>'I wouldn't buy a new, regular car. They're the biggest rip-off imaginable.' And he doesn't care for hotels. 'Almost all of them are overpriced and second-rate.' He can't stand, he says, being taken for a ride. 'I'm not mean. I'm actually rather generous. But I do hate paying \u00a380 for \u00a320 wine.' </p> <p>Having a lot of money isn't enough for a successful life, he insists. 'What's the point of being wealthy if you have no taste? Or if you don't know how to spend it well? It's very important to move in the right circles, and to develop an appreciation of what you can do with money.' In his own circles, he's barely even rich. 'I'm a member at Annabel's nightclub, where the Sultan of Brunei is also a member. I'm probably in the bottom 20 per cent of wealth as far as their member's list goes. But I'm in the top five per cent for popularity, because I can get tickets for Chelsea games.' At the smart, London school his younger children attend, the people he notices who flash the cash openly are 'not old hands like me. It tends to be the 30-something yuppies.'</p> <p>Having lots of money, he says, can enrich your life immeasurably. 'I'm not going to be a hypocrite and say I'd be happier poor.' But, he says, money can only bring happiness if you're in control of it, and not the other way around. 'And I'll tell you something else you won't believe. I'm permanently overdrawn. That's the truth.' </p> <p><b>Net profits</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fool.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">www.fool.co.uk</a><br> Provides a range of information: from experienced investors to people in debt.

  "In October 1991, the pop charts were awash with cheesy rave anthems based on themes from popular TV shows. Most would be forgotten the moment they spluttered out of the Top 40, but, even at the time, 'Go' seemed different. It was artfully constructed around the looming signature chords from David Lynch's Twin Peaks series, and on Top of the Pops its author threw himself about like a small, white, bald maniac. Soon a disbelieving music press was reporting on this vegan, Christian, teetotal, car-hating New York raver with intense eyes that betrayed such a disquieting mix of challenge and apology. Over the next three years, a string of euphoric hit singles followed. Then things got really strange. <p>Moby's friends will tell you that he lives in the same spartan Manhattan apartment as he did when he made 'Go'. He will tell you that he lives in his tour bus, because when his current travels end in December, he and his party will have been on the road for 21 consecutive months - during which time the material circumstances of his life have altered little, but the context has changed beyond all recognition. When he set out, Moby was considered yesterday's man, a talented musician with a penchant for aggravating others and shooting himself in the foot. When he released his latest album, Play, in May last year, the reviews were grudgingly favourable, but small. The US record labels which had turned him down seemed vindicated: Mute, the British independent which is his real home, watched as Play 'flatlined', shifting a meagre 10,000 copies in six months.</p> <p>A year on, Play has sold more than 5 million, going platinum in 17 countries and topping the charts in seven. Few Britons will get through an entire day without hearing at least one piece of Moby music, as he finds himself re-cast as the world's pop star du jour, a phenomenon he likes to refer to as 'obviously a clerical error'. More peculiar still, we should find this comforting. For his is an extraordinary story.</p> <p>Moby looks fit and fresh, but his mostly Brit crew look worn. 'Did you bring any British newspapers with you?' they ask with a hint of desperation as you're introduced backstage at the soon-to-be-rammed Bronco Bowl in Dallas, Texas. For the past few months, he's been treating his audience to some thoughts on the desirability of voting Al Gore for President, but this is very definitely George W Bush country, and last night in Houston, he forgot. I wonder whether this might have been an unconscious survival instinct, and Moby smiles and leads me to his preferred lair at the rear of his massive bronze bus. I'll be amused to note that he 'forgets' tonight, too.</p> <p>We've met before over the years, and I find him little changed on the surface: the same bald head and alert but strangely neutral features. He's always been good company, talking fast, listening well, engaging in conversation with the whole of his being, ever straining to reach the essence of whatever it is you're talking about, even if it's only tape recorders or socks. He's 35 now and claims to have gradually retreated from his formerly dogmatic approach to life and morality. These days, he even gets pissed sometimes. He's relaxed. He's having fun. I was recently with some musicians who complain bitterly about touring the way he is. I ask how he finds the experience.</p> <p>'I love touring because you never really get bored, and if you do get bored, your circumstances are always changing. Even a lot of the little irritants are addictive. Like, the other day, on our way from Albuquerque to Houston, we had a day off in Wichita Falls, Texas, which is officially the middle of nowhere. So you find yourselves walking through desolate places. And especially out west, America is full of them. There's so much space and so few people. Just standing in a parking lot in the middle of nowhere with a warm breeze blowing. You understand why film-makers are so drawn to making movies about the West - the weird guy sitting behind the counter selling cigars, the old lady on the porch\u0085 I love it.'</p> <p>The name began as a kind of joke, almost from the moment Richard Hall was born. He was so small, so frail, that calling him after the fictional scion of his great-great-great grandfather, Herman Melville, seemed to carry hope, to provide a kind of grand raft for the little boy to cling to. His father, an academic chemist, died in a car crash when his son was two, and his mother, Elizabeth, was a hippy artist who smoked pot and hung out with musicians and struggled, with the help of welfare, food stamps, social security, to make ends meet. Both sets of grandparents were wealthy - mother and son were never going to starve - but in the affluent hamlet of Darien, Connecticut, only 15 minutes distant from the neighbourhood Moby's pal Rick Moody was writing about in his novel/film The Ice Storm, they were apart, other.</p> <p>'The more I travel and see, the more I realise how conventional my upbringing was. But at the time, all my friends seemed to have stable, traditional, affluent homes. Now it turns out that lots of Americans were raised under similar circumstances to me, the difference being that they grew up in communities where everyone had messed-up home lives. I had new clothes, but from bargain shops, not Adidas and Levi's like my peers, and I'm sure a lot of people can relate to the sense of inadequacy that gives you. There was this sense of wanting to fit in and not fitting in, even if it was by no means unique to me. Every time I left the house, I was aware of those feelings.'</p> <p>In retrospect, there were silver linings. The number of pop stars who had hippy parents is high: Beck, PJ Harvey and Jarvis Cocker being but three obvious examples (Moby has noticed this, too). A beardy, bead-wearing friend of Elizabeth's tutored the 13-year-old boy in classical guitar and jazz theory. Through examining his mother's book collection, he came to realise that 'most of the heroes of the 20th century had made a virtue of feeling inadequate or displaced'. He read Rambeau, Faulkner and Bukowski ('not my favourite writer, but\u0085') and felt better. He went to study philosophy at Connecticut University, then transferred to New York, where he was disappointed by the inconsequentiality of the syllabus and directed most of his energy towards music. He played guitar with the punky Vatican Commandos and Flipper before graduating to the briefly wonderful New York psychedelicists Ultra Vivid Scene. Then he left for the visceral joys of rave.</p> <p>He'd picked up his Christianity while at school, but dates the rigidity that came to characterise it from the punk period. He can laugh at it now. 'It lasted till 1996 - from the ages of 16 to 30, basically, which is a long time. First I was a rigid punk-rock Marxist. Then I was a rigid vegan dance-music Christian guy\u0085'</p> <p>And what ended those things, I ask.</p> <p>'Empiricism. Going out and looking at the world and realising that fixed orthodoxies make sense on the printed page and in your head when your eyes are closed and you're going to sleep, but they don't make sense when you walk around and look at the world.' What did he want from the doctrines?</p> <p>'Very simply, what I think motivates people to want to hold on to rigid orthodoxies is the simple desire to see the world as a simple, understandable place. The only epiphany I ever had was being able to say that the world is not a simple and understandable place and people who try to make it so are... jerks. They're unpleasant, and no one wants to hang out with them. They're fundamentalists. That's why the first essay in the Play sleeve is specifically about that. What I found was that people were looking to me to be a rigid vegan fundamentalist or dance fundamentalist or Christian fundamentalist, and I find that to be distasteful.'</p> <p>Is he simply saying that Ewan McGregor won't hang with you if you have convictions? 'No. I think those beliefs and ways of living are erroneous as well. The thing is that I was proved wrong so many times that to try and insist that I know better than everyone else is just stupid.'</p> <p>So the end of ideology has worked for Moby, just like the rest of us. Actually, more than the rest of us. Noticing with humility yet an unmistakable frisson of glee that women fancy famous blokes, he has used the belated realisation that his old semi-celibacy was 'erroneous' as a springboard to discovery. Remembering that when Moby goes for something, he really goes for it, you can't help but feel pleased for him. There was the reported romance with Star Wars actress Natalie Portman, a toe dipped into the world of a dominatrix, the games of 'touch knob' (don't even ask) at celebrity parties, even the tawdry affairs of rock'n'roll legend.</p> <p>His most recent foray into the world of Big Celebrity was attending US R'n'B \u00fcbermeister Sean 'Puffy' Combs's lavish ball in the Hamptons. There's a rare grin on Moby's face as he recounts this.</p> <p>'I went mainly to see what it was like - I mean, that sort of ostentation. So you get there and it's this huge house right on the ocean. And his driveway is filled with Bentleys and Mercedes and Porsches and Jaguars\u0085 it's interesting. I can't judge that kind of consumerism, because I don't come from the same kind of cultural place that he comes from, but it was the weirdest mix. </p> <p>I mean, the Hamptons is horrifying. Really horrifying. It's so much money, so much wealth, so much opulence. You go to these parties and its basically just people figuring out what they can get from each other. </p> <p>'So the interesting thing about Puffy's party is that he wants to be part of that, so he'll go to the Hamptons' invitational polo matches, meaning that half the people at the party were moneyed old conservative WASPs, and the other half were homeboys who he grew up with, people from his record company, Bad Boy. And Salman Rushdie and members of boy bands. And everyone had to wear all white, so it was almost as though you couldn't tell who was who. Leo DiCaprio was turned away because he wasn't wearing white. He had to go buy something! The whole thing was just\u0085 interesting.</p> <p>'What I've come to understand is that indulgence can lead to epiphanies more times that abstinence,' he declares. 'My old quasi-celibacy is a good example. I was celibate for the wrong reasons. I was celibate for the same reasons as I was a vegan and didn't drink - because it made me feel superior.'</p> <p>It seems to me that Moby's being a little hard on himself here. The need to place himself beyond criticism surely stemmed from an underlying feeling that he deserved criticism. I suggest this, but he's having none of it.</p> <p>'Well, I could have been criticised for being a rigid, uptight asshole. And then I found myself suddenly being drunk and occasionally having tawdry one-night stands and affairs. And at times it was wonderful, at times sordid and dumb. But it didn't fit any generalisations, and that was the lesson.'</p> <p>At this juncture, I find myself wondering how Moby defines his Christianity these days. He has a problem with that title, he explains, because he thinks it implies self-righteousness. He became a lover of Christ ('in the Platonic sense,' he giggles) when he came across the Gospel according to Matthew at school, which 'just struck me as right'. Soon, church and Bible studies became a refuge from the alienation he felt elsewhere, fitting neatly into the strictured universe he was trying to construct for himself. In his newly chilled mode, he aspires to live according to the teachings of Christ, he says, adding as a casual rejoinder, 'at least some of them, because unfortunately, I have to be a bit selective'. </p> <p>Intriguingly, Moby's personal and musical evolution has mirrored, and in many respects presaged, developments within British culture during the 90s. Just as political ideology appeared to wither away in those years, so did the tribes and factions that had always defined pop culture. Someone once noted that Britain was the only country in the world where someone might ask, 'So what's he like?' and be told, 'Oh, he's a skinhead.'</p> <p>By the decade's end, the style tribes had dissolved, but when Moby released his debut album, Everything is Wrong, in 1995, minds had not yet been fully prised open. This was a couple of years before the Prodigy, Fatboy Slim or Tony Blair and when Moby, with his outsider's disregard for political or aesthetic correctness, released Everything is Wrong, which veered between swirling club anthems, punk thrashes and ambient torch music, it was met mostly with a mixture of disbelief and consternation. Some excited new listeners were won, but at the expense of fashionability: Moby was ahead of his time. Then, a year later, he tested his audience to destruction with a furious, hardcore punk album, Animal Rights, which very few people bought outside of Greece and Germany. </p> <p>Shortly after its release, his mother was diagnosed with cancer and died in 1998, at the age of 54. A friend has referred to this period as Moby's 'dark night of the soul', and he has wondered at the conjunction of that truculent record and his mother's illness.</p> <p>'You hear stories of farm animals getting jittery and running around before earthquakes,' he says. 'Maybe I was anticipating something.'</p> <p>In the event, what followed bore no relation to what anyone expected. Moby scrapped early sessions for a new album, spooked by the vivid rock/dance crossover success of the Prodigy's Fat of the Land. 'It got very distressing, going to expensive recording studios and continually coming out with results I hated,' he confessed shortly afterwards. 'In the end, I went back to my bedroom and made an album full of flaws, quirks and brilliant idiosyncrasies.'</p> <p>The turning point came when he stumbled across a series of recordings made by a couple of amateur American folk-music archivists named John and Alan Lomax. In the 30s, this father-and-son team had toured the South with a primitive 300lb tape recorder in the boot of their car, recording for posterity the gospel and blues sounds they heard at a time when no one else was. Moby found them inspirational and began to experiment with sampling segments of performance by the likes of the Shining Light Gospel Choir, Boy Blue, Bill Landford &amp; The Landfordaires and Bessie Smith, re-situating them in his modern electronic arrangements. It is tribute to the sensitivity with which he did this that tunes such as the now uniquitous breakthrough single 'Natural Blues' and the rippling 'Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?' sound as soulful as they do. </p> <p>Interspersed with the usual eclectic and emotive range of his original compositions, they came to form the spine of Play. And that's why we're here.</p> <p>Some people are asking whether Moby has relaxed his standards too much. As Play has grown in popularity, so have allegations that making money out of the mostly impoverished black artists recorded by the Lomaxes amounts to nothing more nor less than exploitation. Moby's heard the arguments and treats the issue gingerly, pointing out that his motives were sound; he never expected Play to be successful and has tried to make sure that the money generated has gone to the right people. He further posits 'collage and assemblage' as 'one of the dominant creative motifs of the 20th century', adding that most of the compositional elements are generated by him. He is right on all counts, but on the plane to Texas, I came across a more sophisticated argument, which could be seen as applying to modern dance music generally.</p> <p>Boiled down to essentials, the American business academic Jeremy Rifkin claims in a new book that the days of the property-based capitalist economy are numbered. Companies such as Nike, he notes, own little other than a concept, a lifestyle, and more and more people are leasing large items like cars in preference to buying. He suggests that in the future we will be purchasing experiences rather than ownership and that this form of exchange will seep into every area of our lives ('We're moving from commodifying goods and services to commodifying culture'). He claims fusion music is a good example of this process: corporations scour the globe for culture to mine, just as their precursors mined copper or coal. In the process, they tear them from their roots. </p> <p>'When you take a culture and homogenise it, transform it, package it and sell it back to people as paid-for experience, then it is just as possible to deplete cultural diversity as bio-diversity,' Rifkin concludes. Dance music has been doing this, or something very like it, for years. Moby comes to terms with the thesis with impressive speed, but takes a moment to work out what he thinks about it.</p> <p>'When I hear people saying stuff like that, I want to sit them down and give them some nice warm soya milk and cookies and tell them everything's going to be OK. I want to tell them, \"Just because we don't fully understand the complexities of the contemporary world doesn't mean that it's wrong or on the brink of collapse.\" You know, this idea that to remove something from its original context is contrary to contemporary life\u0085 everything is removed from its original context.</p> <p>'But I think that, ultimately, culture is democratic. And a lot of supposed academic liberals really have a hard time with that. </p> <p>I remember talking to my aunts and uncles at Christmas a few years ago, and they were complaining about popular music. They said, \"Why can't radio stations play more Bob Dylan and less of that trite, vacuous Britney Spears?\" The answer is because the majority of the people listening to the radio want to hear Britney right now and they don't want to hear Bob Dylan. I mean, I like both of them. </p> <p>'A lot of people imagine conspiracies where conspiracies just don't exist. These big multinational corporations, all they're trying to do is prop up their quarterly share price so they don't get fired. They don't have any agenda apart from staying in business. </p> <p>I think culture is suffering at their hands; the fact that all the record companies have been bought up by a couple of big multinationals\u0085 the music is definitely suffering. 'But you can't judge it from a static perspective. This is the ebb and flow of culture. We have a few years of generic pop music and crummy boy bands and then the next bunch of Nirvanas and Jane Addictions arrive to blow them away.'</p> <p>For his own part, Moby was recently heard lamenting the demise of beauty as an aspiration in art, pointing out that one of the few places where it is still viewed as a valid end-in-itself is within the dance community - 'And a lot of people are not comfortable with that, thinking that it's not intellectually credible. Which is a shame, I think.' With almost the same breath, however, he will question the lack of virtuosity in modern music. Not long ago, he had a haunting vision of George Gershwin being around today and winding up as the guitarist in Creed.</p> <p>'Now we have virtuoso computer programmers and drum programmers and that's wonderful because great records are being made. But I always wonder how many talents are being lost to mediocre records.</p> <p>'Because I do use George Gershwin as an example. He spent his life becoming a phenomenal pianist, learning compositional skills, learning how to write and sheet-read music, and the world is a richer place for it. It's so sad to think of someone who could have been the next Gershwin, or Miles Davis, or Coltrane, instead churning out a couple of mediocre alternative rock records or dance tracks. Because if everyone around you is doing mediocre stuff, you don't really feel the need to push yourself to do any better. At least very few people do. I mean, much as I might applaud democracy in culture, I'm also selfish in that I love memorable, meaningful music - songs that stay with me and that I can listen to and get an emotional reaction to time and again.'</p> <p>Interestingly, Gershwin's 'Rhapsody in Blue' was specifically conceived as a marriage of classical structure with contemporary jazz dance idiom. It was a crossover. Moby has it in mind to make an album in the spirit of Al Green or Bill Withers meeting Massive Attack, but he thinks it might take time to work up to this.</p> <p>A dollar millionaire before the release of Play, mostly on the strength of his remix and film work, even Moby doesn't know what he's worth now. The most controversial portion of his fortune comes from the car ads he has licensed his tunes to. The first time I met him, he wouldn't even step into a car unless he could be convinced that it was a matter of life and death. He is heroically inconsistent and vague on the rationale behind his change of policy, citing flattery, the fact that some of the ads are decent pieces of art and a desire to support his independent record company as factors. He denies that personal gain was a consideration, because he lives an almost distressingly simple life, despite admitting to 'a sybaritic side' that likes nice hotels and flies business class on trips that last more than four hours. It's notable that even the alienated former mates and old enemies will accuse him of stupidity before greed.</p> <p>I ask if he suffers from guilt over money.</p> <p>'To an extent, but I think I deal with it on a very abstract level.

  "<p>Shell is on bid alert this weekend after the resumption of \u00a355 billion merger talks between major US rivals Chevron and Texaco. </p> <p>So far the Anglo-Dutch oil giant has stayed aloof from merger mania in the global oil industry, as it carries out a restructuring programme. </p> <p>Texaco, however, has long been seen as an ideal merger mate, and a formal bid by Chevron could spur Shell chairman Mark Moody-Stuart to act, City corporate financiers said. </p> <p>The US oil companies first held merger talks in May last year, only to call the deal off a month later over price and who would gain control. </p> <p>Worth \u00a320bn and trading at a discount to its peers, Texaco is one of the few attractive targets left in the industry. However, an intervention by Shell would lead to fears of closure at the huge Texaco refinery at Milford Haven, the mainstay of the south-west Wales economy. </p> <p>The sector has seen a whirlwind of deals, prompted by the previously low oil price, over recent years. First BP merged with Amoco, then it took over smaller US rival Atlantic Richfield (Arco). Then Exxon swallowed Mobil to reclaim the number one slot. Last year, too, French and Belgian groups Elf and Totalfina merged to create the number four behind Shell. </p> <p>Recently, Chevron was understood to be in exploratory talks with Phillips, a smaller US rival. The main attraction of Texaco , however, is that both are involved in Caltex, a successful refining and petrol station joint venture in Asia Pacific, Africa and the Middle East.</p>",
  "<p>This year's Venice Film Festival did not boast a hugely impressive selection of films. Tellingly, the opening film was Clint Eastwood's OAP odyssey Space Cowboys. Standing out among the other entries, however, was Memento, a film by a young UK director named Christopher Nolan, and if you hadn't seen his low-budget debut, a thriller called Following, you could be forgiven for thinking this was just another worthy British corset-and-bonnet drama. But Memento turned out to be something very different. Its roots are in film noir, but it also harks back to the darker classics, like Josef Von Sternberg's The Blue Angel, in which human will is revealed to be grim, flawed and perversely inevitable. It stars Guy Pearce as Leonard, a man with no short-term memory, an affliction that is apparently the result of the shock he experienced when seeing his wife raped and killed by an intruder. The killer's name is John G, as Leonard knows all too well, since his name is tattooed across his chest, surrounded by various clues to the killer's habitat and identity. But unusually for a film of this type, Memento begins with the final judgment and then tells the story backwards. </p> <p>Leonard has John G at gunpoint, and wastes no time in killing him. But how did Leonard get here? It's a question that Memento skirts around with admirable dexterity; because of Leonard's 'condition', the film only tells us what he knows, when he knows it, and teases us with the circumstances. There's the sultry Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who bonds with Leonard because she's lost a lover too and sympathises (or does she?). And there's his irritating friend Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), another shifty character. And for a while it simply seems that Memento is taking us nowhere in particular, just backwards, until it suddenly pans out to reveal its carefully hidden agenda. And if you make it that far (no one's saying it will be easy), this imaginative and daring film turns into a thrilling mystery. </p> <p>Twist follows twist, and the final, subtle revelation lingers long in the mind, a startling piece of double-think that trumps The Usual Suspects's surprise denouement. </p> <p>Pearce, of course, should be used to this kind of stuff, having co-starred as upright cop Ed Exley in the adaptation of James Ellroy's brain-aching novel LA Confidential. Even so, he admits on the sun-drenched terrace of the Excelsior Hotel on the Venice Lido, it wasn't exactly immediate. So how did he take it? 'Probably similar to you, when you watched the film,' he grins, 'in that there's a lot of specific detail about the character and a lot of ambiguity about what he's going through as well as a great deal of confusion. I really had to break the script down and try to look at it as a more logical set of circumstances. Because at the end of every scene, you're not really satisfied like you are when you're watching a normal film. You're desperate to see the next scene to have it make sense.' </p> <p>Nolan, the brains behind this extraordinary film, is a nonchalant 30-year-old. His rapid career rise has occurred with apparent ease. He simply stuck to his studies at college in London and made films in his spare time. He has, he says, made films since he was eight years old, when he and his brother made 8mm war movies starring their Action Man figures, although the arrival of Star Wars sent him off briefly into the realm of science fiction. </p> <p>Asked how he got into making films on a more serious level, Nolan says simply that he did it 'by making a film. Kubrick was asked this once,' he says, 'and he said exactly the same thing. You only learn by doing it.' </p> <p> Following, the micro-budget British thriller he released last year, had some of Memento 's panache, if not its production values. But sensing a way forward, Nolan pushed the film through a series of film festivals, starting with San Francisco. The attention brought him the deal to make Memento, which was inspired by a short story his brother was writing about a killer suffering an identity crisis. Nolan borrowed the story and ran with it, but far from being aggrieved, his brother helped him construct the film's elaborate and ingenious website at <a href=\"http://www.otnemem.com\">www.otnemem.com</a> (memento backwards). </p> <p>The film went on to become a hit at three of the summer's major festivals. In Venice, Nolan says the subtitles didn't carry all of the film's jet-black humour and the fraught silence perturbed him, he really didn't know whether the notoriously fickle crowd would cheer or boo. Needless to say, he was astounded when he received a five-minute ovation, and yet again the following week when Memento won three major awards at the Deauville festival in France. The screening at the Toronto festival caused a major buzz, too, and Nolan is having a hard time adjusting. </p> <p>Without even trying, Nolan has effortlessly broken away from the rash of Britpack gangster films. His vision goes back to the more surreal and stately likes of Nicolas Roeg and Lindsay Anderson, who revolutionised our movie style (if not our industry) in the Seventies. There is, however, a catch to all this: we can only lay claim to half of Christopher Nolan when we try to set Memento against the Britfilm failures of the past 12 months. </p> <p>'My mother's American,' he says, 'so I've got both passports and I can work in both places. I've lived a bit in the States, but I've spent most of my life in England, so I always knew I had this great opportunity to work in both places.' </p> <p>And for the moment, he's staying in LA, where he moved with his wife when she landed a new job with British production company Working Title. In fact, he's just got back from Alaska, where he's been scouting locations for his next film, a remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller Insomnia, which starred Stellan Skarsgard as a crack detective who accidentally kills his partner. </p> <p>'To tell you the truth, I first had the idea when I saw the movie two years ago,' he says. 'I thought it could have been a much bigger movie - it had such a great central premise. But I thought it would be really interesting to take it in a slightly different direction, make it slightly more expansive. Make it different by Americanising it.' </p> <p>And if Memento is anything to go by, the chances are Nolan should do an impressive job. And at a time when the British movie industry is low, gloomy and fatalistic, we need a director like that - a new Ridley Scott, to lift us out of the doldrums. So what if we can only claim half? On current form, it's got to be better than nothing.'</p> <p><strong>Carrie-Anne Moss, the star of Memento</strong><br>Interview by Mark Morris</p> <p>Carrie-Anne Moss is trying to talk about Memento, but it's hard. Not because she doesn't like the film (she loves it) or because it was a tough experience. The problem is a little more immediate: it's the five puppies that are scrabbling all over her. 'I have a slew of animals,' she explains out of breath. 'It's my final puppy day: they are going to their new homes at the weekend.' </p> <p>So it turns out that the 33-year-old Moss isn't quite the icy figure that her role in The Matrix suggested. But that remains the only place most us will have seen her. Until the Wachowski brothers insisted that she was the only actress who could play Trinity, her career had consisted of things like F/X: The Series. Not, she says, that she ever complained, 'It's really hard to make a living as an actor. I'm grateful as I drive to work every morning.'</p> <p>She was born and raised in Vancouver - her accent remains unmistakably Canadian - and left home to become a model. She was working in Spain when the chance came to act, and she moved to LA in the early Nineties. Then came the years of bad TV. But she reckons it helped her that stardom didn't come to her too young. 'Now, I don't give it much weight. I've become a lot wiser over the years.'</p> <p>And anyway, it was all destined. 'I think everything happens at exactly the time it's supposed to.'</p> <p>When I ask her about the wilder claims that have been made for the meaning of The Matrix, she says, 'The metaphysical meaning of the movie is part of my life.' Now, there is a decent chance she is being incredibly deadpan, but she sounds as if she means it. She will spend the next two years working on Matrix sequels. 'When I said I would do them, I hadn't read the script or anything, but I trust the brothers that much. I knew I wanted to do it.'</p> <p>Before that, we'll see her in Chocolat, Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m's adaptation of Joanne Harris's best seller with a heavyweight cast including Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp and Judi Dench.As for Memento, did she know how the intricate noir was going to work while they were shooting it? 'I did, but not to the extent of how it was. When I saw the final film I was blown away, it was spectacular.'</p> <p>\u0095 Memento opens on Friday.</p>",
  "<p>'I don't have any friends who are girls.' He sniggers. 'I've got about 20 girlfriends though.' Several people laugh at this and a grin of triumph spreads over his face. He's got cropped hair and a practised air of urban cool, leaning back in his chair in his grungy clothes and mud-spattered, unlaced boots, smirking, casting amused and complicit glances at his neighbours, acting tough. He's skinny, 11 years old, a little boy wanting to be the centre of attention, playing it for laughs. </p> <p>'I just want to talk about sex,' says another boy, under his breath but wanting to be heard. </p> <p>I am sitting in a circle of 29 Year Seven girls and boys at King Edward VII lower school in Sheffield, for what's called 'Personal, Social and Health Education'. Dot Kesterton, one of the few full-time PSHE teachers in the country, remains impeccably cool as she 'climate sets' for the discussions they will have over the next few terms. </p> <p>Not far from this 1,600-strong comprehensive, an 11-year-old boy got his 14-year-old girlfriend pregnant last year and was splashed all over the tabloids (one gave him a BMX in return for his story). The baby has now been born and the boy says he is proud to be a father. He claims it was sex education that was to blame - the words put ideas into his head. Until then, he says he was an innocent child. </p> <p>And in Rotherham, a few miles away, an 11-year-old girl gave birth to her baby without even realising she was pregnant. Not far away, West Yorkshire, an area of great beauty, closed mines, high poverty and lost hopes, has the highest teenage pregnancy records in the UK. </p> <p>Everyone in the class has written private statements for Dot Kesterton, setting out what they want and do not want from their peers, from which she has extrapolated a list. It is a litany of curiosity, fear and secret desires. What they want is what they often don't have, and what they fear is what they often get. More than anything, they want people to listen to them, not to laugh at them. They want people to try to understand them and not to bully them, ignore them, tease and torment them; to be friendly, calm, attentive. </p> <p>They don't want people to embarrass them or talk about them behind their back, to snigger, sneer or make them feel sad, alone, ignorant, different and ashamed. They want to know about sex education, drugs, disease, homosexuality, bisexuality, sexual intercourse, Aids, sexism, alcohol, peer pressure, child abuse, friendships... </p> <p>In private, they are eager, uncertain and anxious about these things. In public, they sit in a fidgeting, self-conscious circle, whispering, snickering, giggling, frowning, smiling in a knowing way, tapping their feet, playing with their hair, doodling on their folders, looking down at their laps. There's a great divide between how young people feel and how they behave. Their soft, inner self is kept separate from the hardened self they present to the outside world. It's cool to be cool; cool to be tough; cool to be sexy; cool to pretend you're an adult. The dreamy, curious world of childhood gets hidden away. </p> <p>'You can't say to teenagers, \"Don't do that\",' says a 16-year-old girl, speaking at a meeting of the National Children's Bureau's Sex Education Forum, an umbrella body that promotes effective sex education. 'There's a difference between education and promotion,' says another. 'There's too much focus on sex and not enough on what leads to sex; there's not enough about relationships.' 'Why aren't we asked what we feel? Adults think they have the right to tell us what things we should hear. We should have input. We should grow up realising it's not a subject to be scared of, so that when we grow up we can sit down and talk to our own children.' </p> <p>These teenagers are articulate, composed and show emotional intelligence. All but one of those who speak are girls. Adults speak but don't listen, they say. They all say that they want their voices and their views to be heard. </p> <p>The Government has just launched a new advertising campaign to encourage teenagers to abstain from early sex. 'It's OK to be a virgin,' said one headline. Yvette Cooper, the Public Health Minister, has encouraged the advertising agency to use a 'hip' and 'groovy' tone, rather than a forbidding or embarrassed one. So a poster that reads 'Sex: Are You Thinking About It Enough?' captures young people's attention, while the small print encourages them to think it's cool to say no. Critics of the scheme have already drawn parallels between this scheme and the attempt earlier in the year to lessen the use of waif models in magazines. They accuse the Government of interference, bossiness and irrelevance. </p> <p>It's the irrelevance that really mat ters, the belief that a poster can prevent at a glance what young people have learnt over years. Young people embark on their first sexual relationships because of their confidence and lack of it, their self-esteem and lack of it, their fear, their curiosity, their ignorance; because of peer pressure, the need for affection, the terror of being different; because they are in love; because they want a lift home; because it's fun; because hormones are surging round their bodies; because their dad's run off, their mum's run off; because they are mature enough; because they are immature; because they want to say yes; because they can't say no; because they don't feel loved in the rest of their life; because it's what they think they're expected to do; because they are bombarded in all directions by sexualised images; because why not, because what the hell, because they are ignorant about the consequences and think that if you do it standing up you're not going to have a baby; because adults are hypocritical about sex; because they are told not to; because it is risky and reckless; because Aids and syphilis won't happen to them; because nobody talks about it; because nobody listens; because they are 14, 15, 16, 17; because they want to, need to. </p> <p>And because of desire, which, put in the scale against all the epic cons, can tip it. So much of the way we think about sex in the UK is in terms of disease and dysfunction, blisters and babies. Sex education is often framed in ideology and measured by how successful it is in limiting teenage pregnancy. Young people are told by their parents and figures of authority how it happens, but why it shouldn't ('it' being one of the most common ways of not saying the word). Sex becomes smutty and forbidden, titillating and trashy. Desire, pleasure and respect are off the agenda. Nor is there any evidence that simply telling young people to abstain has any effect, rather the reverse. More knowledge means less early sex. More talk means less action. </p> <p>Yet among many people, there is still considerable resistance to a coherent sex-education policy and a belief that to provide sex education is to promote sexual activity. The media still blames liberal teachers and parents for lower ages of first sexual experiences. Education as corruption: the 11-year-old boy becoming a father because of what he heard in the classroom. </p> <p>Sex as smut, the ultimate British joke - silly and tacky. Sex as hypocrisy - it sells newspapers, TV programmes. It saturates our culture and jumps out at us from billboards, yet it is still a forbidden subject of serious debate. Sex as a double standard - boys are taught about masturbation and wet dreams; girls are taught about periods and pregnancy. Sex as something separate from relationships, and the world in which we live now. </p> <p>The needs of children are so dramatic and yet nobody is really talking. For many young people, sex is not a rebellion but a way of belonging, not a pleasure but a trap and a nightmare. </p> <p> <strong> Children</strong> </p> <p> 'Children are sexually educated anyway,' says Simon Blake of Sex Education Forum who on 31 October chairs a conference, 'Taking the Initiative', which will explore effective sex education. 'Whether we like it or not, they learn. They learn from all around them - from TV, newspapers and magazines, other children. Myths are ingrained and children live in a deeply sexualised culture. Even very young children are encouraged to behave in a sexual way.' </p> <p>The rituals of the playground have changed. Pre-teen boys and girls used to play at mummies and daddies. Now they play at going out, complicated mimicries of dating, kissing, flirting and dumping. A boy will ask a girl out, or at least his mates will ask her out for him, for this is nothing to do with friendship. 'Going out' may consist of a circuit of a playground; dumping means ignoring them the next day. Whereas Dutch children tend to have friends of both sexes, in Britain boys and girls live in parallel worlds. </p> <p> <strong> Girls</strong> </p> <p> The majority of teenage girls say they regret their first sexual encounters. Most say they first have sex because pressure is put on them by boys. Although the teenage pregnancy rate across all groups is higher than in other countries, it is much higher for those girls who don't see a future for themselves - who have academically failed, who are poor, or who are the children of very young parents. 'It is too easy just to say that sex education is a simple social exclusion issue,' says Gill Frances of the National Children's Bureau. </p> <p>'But it is true that teenage pregnancy rates are up to nine times higher in poorer areas. Sex and relationship education should be an entitlement, but it won't cure the problem of social exclusion and poverty. It works the other way round. Put yourself into the mind of a young girl of 15, living in a run-down estate; she's never known what it is to feel secure, her dad's somewhere else, she's never fitted into her school, she's lonely, scared, unconfident. You can understand, can't you, why she'd have a baby.' </p> <p>When girls are asked why they first have sex, says Jo Adams of the Sheffield Centre of Aids and Sexual Health, they answer, \"To keep my boyfriend, to get a cuddle, to know I'm attractive, because I loved him, to get a lift home\". These reasons do not necessarily have anything to do with sex, particularly not with depressing bad sex with a partner who may not be well chosen. </p> <p>'It's like looking in the fridge for feelings. You don't find out that you're attractive, intelligent or beloved in the back seat of a car or in rapid, fumbling sex behind the youth centre. Girls can get into a downward spiral of self-esteem and diminishing returns. </p> <p>In Jo Adams's groups of girls, the focus is on assertiveness and self-esteem. 'Which bit of no didn't you understand?' is one of the catch- phrases of the group which calls itself Girls on a Mission. Lots of the young people she works with come from poor and fractured families; they are bored, frustrated and undermined. 'One of my colleagues said that if you gave everyone a bike, there'd be a lot less sex. There's something in that.' If girls are encouraged to go cycling, play the guitar, write poetry, do yoga, practical things where they can feel successful and empowered, then they feel more in control of their lives and their futures. Horizons, which had been blotted out, open up. Success breeds success; assertiveness assertiveness. Saying no once means that it is easier to say no the second time. </p> <p>When teenage girls were asked how they felt after not saying no to sex when they wanted to say no, the replies were: 'Angry... anxious... despairing... resentful... tired... annoyed with myself... irritated... uncomfortable... disappointed... frustrated_ fed-up.' And after managing to say no: 'Not so scared... pleased with myself... more open with the other person... strong... satisfied...less anxious... relieved... proud of myself... lighter.' </p> <p> <strong> Boys</strong> </p> <p> Most teenage boys first have sex because pressure is put on them by other boys. </p> <p> 'Many boys don't report regret,' says Gill Frances, 'which doesn't mean they don't feel it. But they are under huge pressure, and frequently they wish it hadn't happened. They live in a culture in which early sexual experience is glorified. Young boys posture in front of each other. But they have real anxieties about sex.' She and Simon Blake talk of things that teenage boys have said to them: 'I was right in the middle of it, and I thought, \"What will my friends think of me now?\" I wondered what on earth I was doing and then I remembered that my friends would cheer when I walked out of the door\".' They talk about the great divide between the tough, swaggering, posturing public persona of boys in particular and the scared, unready private one: 'Culture rewards them for the public persona. These teenagers know the trap they are in and still they can't get out of it. It is too dangerous for them. Think of all the bullying and the homophobia.' </p> <p>Jo Adams agrees. 'Boys present a cool and streetwise image, effing and blinding and talking about girls being up for it. Conquest is part of their status. I've heard teenage boys, say: \"What's the matter with you; haven't you got a kid yet? Some kind of poofter?\" The way they talk, you'd think they were Warren Beatty, but we get them to write down in private the questions they want asked, and these great, strapping lads of 15 and 16 ask: is it all right to have wet dreams, or how long should an erect penis be? They are marshmallows inside, anxious, frightened, excited, the way we all feel when we start out on a relationship. </p> <p>'What often worries me is that a lot of professionals who should know better - doctors, teachers, nurses - believe the image these lads present. They don't see beneath the surface. We've got to explore behind the fa\u00e7ade.' </p> <p>'But what we need to ask,' says Gill Frances, 'is how do we talk to that private, vulnerable, tender, needy boy? How do we reach him, rather than the swaggering, cocky persona he is hiding behind? The socialisation of boys here,' she continues, 'is vile . It is very different in Scandinavia and Holland. There, there is not the same division between genders. In Holland, as many boys as girls say they have sex for love. Here, they do it because of what their mates will think. In Holland, they talk to their mother or father, go to the clinic with their partner.' </p> <p>Boys are more homophobic than girls. If boys are not good enough at being 'male', this has a huge and horrible impact on them at school and among their peers. By being anti-gay, they are proving their own masculinity. Boys who are clever, good at school, into certain types of music, who are too small, too pretty, whose voices are not deep enough, who like the company of girls, these are the boys who are going to have a tough time. Jo Adams thinks that while feminism has given girls a way of thinking about their sexuality, there's no equivalent for boys: 'Just Iron John beating his chest in the woods, or Wet New Man. Feminists had to slog; they took risks. There are some boys taking risks now, and they are vilified.' </p> <p> <strong> Parents</strong> </p> <p> Most children say that they want to learn about sex from their parents first, but a lot of adults are ignorant about sex themselves. Simon Blake says that adults often ask questions like: 'How do I know if I've had an orgasm? Am I putting it in the right hole? Where does a period come from? Will I get pregnant if I swallow sperm?' </p> <p>One of the reasons that Holland and Scandinavia are so much more successful in their sex education than we are is because parents talk more and more openly to their children. Here, even when we are reasonably confident with the biology, we are inadequate with the relationships. Yet all the research shows that children want the facts to come out of talking through feelings. They want to talk about sex as important and connected with the rest of their life, not just as a mechanical act but an emotional one, as something that is special and prized. 'If you talk about it as mucky and round the back, you do it mucky and round the back,' says Gill Frances. </p> <p>'Don't talk to them about your own sex lives or ask directly about theirs,' says Simon Blake. 'Talk generally; come at the matter sideways. Discuss sexual relationships in general. It's tough to talk about our own sex lives, but it's easy and safe and not embarrassing to think about other people's lives and problems, or chat about dilemmas facing characters in soap operas.' </p> <p>He describes a recent confrontation between a mother and son. Son (genuinely wanting to initiate a debate): 'When do you think you're old enough to have sex?' Mother (terrified): ' I hope you're not doing it .' Son (who wasn't) probably goes out and does 'it'. </p> <p>It is often preferable for fathers to talk to sons, mothers to daughters. 'Women don't necessarily understand male sexuality,' says Gill Frances, 'so they often pitch it wrong. If a boy says, \"I keep having erections\" the mother might say, \"That's disgusting, you should show more respect\", whereas the father's more likely to say, \"Only 10 a day!\" He would normalise it, take away the anxiety and the shame. </p> <p>Liz Wilson works with a group in Sheffield called Parents Together Project; her official title is 'voluntary parent peer educator'. She has been trained as an educator and now works with parent groups, either for a single, two-hour session or over four week, to help them feel more confident about the way they are talking to and listening to their children. 'It's really about enabling better communication between parents and kids,' she says, 'but focusing on sexual relationships.' </p> <p>Her own children are seven, 10 and 13. She has conversations with each of them, from the 'Where do I come from' questions, through to puberty, wet dreams, being gay. 'Before I did the training,' she says, 'my approach was that I would always answer any questions that they asked me openly, honestly, without embarrassment. But, you know, there are loads of questions they simply don't ask, and we need to encourage parents to bring up the subject, but in a natural kind of way.' </p> <p>She gives as an example a situation with her 13-year-old son: 'We were watching a TV drama and everyone was leaping in and out of bed with each other, and I asked, \"What do you think about that? Should they have had sex with each other so quickly?\" I'm not saying, \"What's going on in your sex life?\" but rather trying to look with him at issues around sex and relationships. </p> <p>'Young people are entitled to their secrets and parents need to respect that, just as I wouldn't tell my children about my own sexual practices. We should go at things obliquely - it's often better to talk while not looking at each other. Talk when you're cooking, walking, driving along in a car. And,' she adds, 'talk about sex as something that can be wonderful, pleasurable, important.' </p> <p>She says she thinks boys have a raw deal. 'Mums and daughters talk more, and they have more starting points, like the start of menstruation, obviously. Boys have no real starting point. And they have much more pressure. There are lots of ways for a girl to be a girl, but only one way for a boy to be a boy. I think it's rotten for them.' </p> <p> <strong> Schools</strong> </p> <p> Sex education is on the national curriculum in secondary schools now, but only the reproductive and hormonal parts - 'The stuff about making babies,' as Gill Frances puts it. All the rest - friendship, self-esteem, desire, disease, everything that may enable a child to think about becoming an adult, everything that may give children pause - is taught under PSHE and is voluntary. In a strange way, we are moralistic about sex, and yet in sex education we take it out of its moral context, making it clinical and alien. </p> <p>'Too little, too late, too biological,' says Jo Adams. 'Not enough about emotions, which is what all young people say they need and want. Not about being jealous, getting dumped, being scared, body-image, rage, shame, guilt, being laughed at.' </p> <p>Gill Frances talks about the school as the place where the 'jigsaw' that the parents have started gets filled in, and where skills must be developed and practised with a peer group. 'We need to get to kids before the rest of the world gets to them. Of course,' she adds, 'the pre-giggle stage is younger and younger. Teachers, who are often untrained and squeeze PSHE into \"guidance\" sessions and circle time, remain anxious about sex education because they are often operating on the blurred line of the law. One hard-pressed teacher told me that at her school of course they hardly teach any sex education at all.' </p> <p>John Tripp of Exeter University has a more behaviourist approach to sex education. 'Knowledge is simply not enough. We need a kind of social learning.' He is the founder of A Pause (Added Power and Understanding in Sex Education), whose programme is to be delivered to all secondary schools in north and east Devon. He believes that abstaining from sexual activity, even for a few months, is extremely beneficial to young people. </p> <p>Traditional sex education, he says, is bound to be problematic. Teachers have not had the training, have no methodology to deal with it confidently. The clich\u00e9 of the young female teacher in a class full of snickering teenage boys is often also the truth. Also, he says, schools are largely 'places of fact. Teachers are not usually required to deal with relationships and feelings'. </p> <p>He also claims that there is no evidence that the plain facts influence teenagers' behaviour one way or the other. 'Behaviour is largely dependent on what you see around you. What you see,' he adds, 'is often not the truth - young people often think that everyone except them is having sex, because they say that they are, whereas, of course, most of them aren't. Part of A Pause's work is to demolish the myths.' </p> <p>A Pause uses out-of-school professionals (they have more credibility than teachers) and 16- to-19-year-olds to deliver sex education. The class becomes more collaborative and open. It is split into small groups; role-plays are encouraged. Tripp has even coined the term 'outercourse' (as opposed to intercourse), as a way of encouraging young people to hold off from early and unhappy sex. </p> <p>'We are not trying to make them toe the line. We're not indoctrinating young people against sexual activity. We are trying to help their self-efficacy skills, so that they actually do what they want and believe in, rather than become swamped by social pressure. It is tragic how few girls actually enjoy their first sexual experiences. We want people to have have successful, long-term sexual careers.' </p> <p> <strong> Talking</strong> </p> <p> 'We live in a country of prudery and pornography,' says Jo Adams. 'We are struggling with a tabloid culture. The very people who are really trying to develop a strategy for helping young people are peddled as the people who are irresponsible, and who are blamed for adolescent behaviour. Why should we expect young people to be responsible, when they've got us as role models? Sex isn't scandalous or dirty. Take it out from behind the bike sheds. Take it out from under the proscriptions of religious leaders.' </p> <p>'We aren't honest with young people,' says Gill Frances. 'We tell them to say no, but we don't tell them that sex is far more difficult to refuse than chocolate. We say: watch out! Be careful. We say it's dangerous. We don't say it's fun, pleasurable, lovely, important, but there are problems. Sex education is not just about knowledge and finding information; it's about finding ways of talking to children and listening to them.' </p> <p>'But it's hard to talk about sex,' says Jo Adams. 'We talk about emotions, we talk about family, work, food, holidays and verrucas... there's a great silence surrounding sex. We don't even talk with our partners - we have sex with them, but we can't say the words. </p> <p>'And one of the things we struggle with is that sex does need to be risky in some ways. So how do we create a context in sex education that enables a young person to take risks safely.' </p> <p>'It's about emotional intelligence,' says Gill Frances, 'and the power to name feelings, to be able to say, \"I'm scared and in need. I'm lonely. Please help\".' </p> <p>'It's about talking,' says Jo Adams. 'Start with talking.' </p> <p>'And,' says Gill Frances, 'it's about saying we have to change the world.' </p> <p><strong> Sextistics</strong><br> </p> <p>Britain has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Europe, and one of the highest of any developed country. Every year, 90,000 teenagers in England become pregnant; 8,000 of these are under 16; 2,200 are aged 14 or younger. Three-fifths of conceptions - about 56,000 - result in live births </p> <p>The UK has teenage birth rates twice as high as Germany's, three times as high as France's, more than six times as high as in the Netherlands. A significant proportion of young women conceive more than once in their teens: one in six teenagers who had an abortion in 1997 had already had an abortion or a live birth. </p> <p>One in eight young women who had their first baby in their teens went on to have a second child before they reached the age of 20. </p> <p>Conception rates are high compared to European countries, even in the more affluent areas, but are far worse in the poorest areas. Poverty and academic failure are good indicators of teenagers at sexual risk. </p> <p>Teenagers are having sex earlier in Britain than other European countries, although the average age for first sex is 17, and two-thirds of teenagers do not have sex before they are 16. In Holland, the average age for the first sexual encounter is six months later than in the UK. </p> <p>Between a third and a half of sexually active teenagers do not use contraceptives during first sexual intercourse. </p> <p> There is less syphilis in Sweden than in a single STD clinic in London. </p> <p>In Holland, 40 per cent of boys discuss contraception with their girlfriends before sex; in UK, it's 15 per cent. </p> <p> More than 50 per cent of 14- to 15-year-olds are not taught anatomy fully, despite many of them being sexually active already. </p> <p>A recent survey showed teenagers think there is too much emphasis in sex education on the 'mechanics' and not enough on emotions </p> <p> In Britain, there seems to be a strange disconnection between sex and pleasure: in most first sexual experiences, either the girl (two or three in every four), or both the girl and boy regret the encounter. So young people are having sex earlier, getting pregnant more - and not even enjoying it, even regarding it with a sense of dread.</p>",
  "<p>There is a joke about a driver asking for directions in Ireland. 'If I was you sir,' the local replies, 'I wouldn't start from here.' It came to mind contemplating the FA's currently lost location as they search for a new England coach. </p> <p>The man who put the mess in messiah should have gone in the summer after Euro 2000. In hindsight, the big players at the FA would probably now acknowledge it, in private at least. Never in 10 weeks was Kevin Keegan going to acquire the acumen for international footballing strategy that he himself finally admitted to lacking. </p> <p>Better then than now, given that a new man would have been easier to woo in a close season and that anyone currently successful - which is what England should be looking for - is going to be in several minds about quitting on something that is building up a head of steam. But the fact is that England do have to start from here and one can only hope that the FA show the foresight they lacked in Keegan's appointment. The signposts suggest a long and winding road with several hazards ahead. </p> <p>The first is the panel of kingmakers chosen by the FA, mostly from their international committee. All of them - Howard Wilkinson, Peter Ridsdale, David Dein, Noel White, David Davies and Dave Richards - have flaws and vested interests. </p> <p>Wilkinson, the technical director, may well want the job himself; at the least he will want to ensure that the new man is in tune with his methods. Ridsdale, the chairman of Leeds United, and Dein, vice-chairman of Arsenal, will want to keep their own managers, David O'Leary and Wenger, off the short list. White detests Terry Venables; Davies still talks fondly of him. Richards' record as chairman of Sheffield Wednesday speaks for itself. And none has kicked a ball for other than a photo-opportunity. </p> <p>'I can't think of anyone in football who doesn't have a vested interest in something or someone. Choosing any set of people is very difficult,' says the FA's chief executive, Adam Crozier. 'As a team, if we felt there was genuinely someone with a conflicting edge, we would conflict them out, just like with a board of directors. It is quite normal.' Couldn't that mean that all six could find themselves leaving a meeting at some point. 'In theory I suppose that is correct but I don't think that will happen,' Crozier adds. </p> <p>He insists that the FA - he and 'one or two' members of the panel - will be taking professional advice over the next 10 days to two weeks. 'We want to go out and get expert advice,' he says. 'We talk a lot about public opinion and, yes, that is one thing and I wouldn't decry it, but what is more important is expert opinion. We will talk to people in the game and say, \"You have been England manager before...\", \"some of you may have managed top clubs and players...\". We need to understand what they think. We are not saying, \"Make the decision for us\", we are just asking their opinions.' </p> <p>Crozier says that the process will then involve reporting back to the panel as a whole and coming up with a short list - of two or three names, he expects. He will then approach the men named. It will avoid, he says, the confusion of some five years ago when the then chief executive Graham Kelly's emissary, Jimmy Armfield, canvassed opinion, and 'four or five people thought they had been offered the job'. </p> <p>It is a start, and Crozier is to be commended for insisting that this time the FA will put their foot on the ball rather than react with a jerk of the knee as they did a year before his own appointment and the result was the knee-jerk management of Keegan. The current approach smacks of fudging and expediency, however. </p> <p>Now Crozier may be young, Scottish and from a non-football background, but his instincts and utterances seem sound. 'Long term', 'seeking professional help', 'a programme of development with the England team at the pinnacle', he says. But it does look as if his new broom has already encountered a thick pile of dust in the Lancaster Gate committee rooms. </p> <p>He has apparently been 'slapped down' by the FA chairman, Geoff Thompson, for daring to suggest that he himself would do the interviewing, that it would ultimately be his decision. Crozier probably meant nothing of the sort, except that he would be the one who finally settled the contract. More probably, he wanted to facilitate the appointment being made more professionally by people with insider knowledge. Take these statements. </p> <p>'I don't think in the past people have put enough thought into talking to the individual about what their philosophy is, how they would handle the job, who they might have with them, their experience, how they feel about outside pressures, the difference between club and international management.' </p> <p>And: 'What was interesting when I arrived was how little time people spent talking about football. All the commercial stuff, all the rest of it is all very well but it is to generate money to put back into football. Football is the essential thing.' </p> <p>It is sad that FA politics appear to preclude him from what is probably his gut feeling - his overseeing an independent task force with a mandate to hire from among the ranks of people who have seen the trends of the international game, the successes and failures of the England team, over the past decade. </p> <p>And there is a huge fund of expertise. The FA have had a Wiseman or two in recent years. Now they need a few wise men. </p> <p>Glasnost and perestroika came hard to the old Politburo, too. Crozier needs to retain his courage in plotting his way through the FA plotting. After years of infighting, the French managed it, with such as Aim\u00e9 Jacquet and Gerard Houllier ditching their egos, hitching their talents to the greater good. It is what England needs with Wilkinson - clearly no international manager but an able organiser who has forged the beginnings of a progressive structure - subjecting his department to the new man. </p> <p>'I believe there is genuinely a great opportunity for the right person,' says Crozier and he is correct when he says that the current England squad are underperforming and that foreign coaches look enviously at a new generation about to emerge. The appropriate coach will surely learn as much when he takes his first training session. It is why it is too soon to give up on this World Cup qualifying campaign. </p> <p>Now is the time for the English game to learn some enlightened professional methods that filter down to young players and empower England to produce the movement to rejoin the world game as equals over the next five years. </p> <p>Soon the FA will move headquarters from Lancaster Gate to Soho Square, the centre of our film industry. May some of its fantasy rub off to sweep away the recent grim v\u00e9rit\u00e9 both inside the FA and in the team. Wanted: man, and men, of vision who will enable the English game to watch some moving pictures again. Moving in both senses.</p>",
  "<p>Winning the World Cup is not down to chance, it's the result of hard work, a will to follow a strong policy, a search for superior football. If somebody wants to copy our system they must start by developing the blueprint, developing the coaches, and developing the players. These are the essentials. Today my role involves supervising the education of tomorrow's coaches, then they form the players. This is what technical direction is. We are the only ones in Europe to do this and it was started by Gerard Houllier. He created a special diploma for youth coaches called formateurs. They number 80 to 100 and every year they come back to the Federation to learn more. It's an ongoing thing. </p> <p>The main reason we won the World Cup is we had an exceptional generation of players and they are the fruits of a policy that was put together more than 30 years ago by the French Football Federation. We were very lucky to have had a group of people in charge who projected a great view of the future, knowing that if we wanted to be competitive we had to be organised. </p> <p>Georges Boulogne [national coach from 1969-73] had the idea to create a national technical direction. At the time, French football wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. He put the structures in place, and developed a whole line of thinking, a philosophy. He recently died, and thank God he saw France become world champions. </p> <p>He created what we call the formation , the development of young players - an enormous revolution. At the time, people didn't understand because the clubs were obliged to take it on and suddenly they had to find people to look after the kids and wondered what to do about school. </p> <p>Today we have very well prepared new young players. We are under-18 world champions. With the growing influence of agents, huge contracts and star lifestyles, it is increasingly difficult to ensure the boys sustain a sporting attitude. But the beauty of our way of working is that even if you are a young star, if you don't have the will to work properly you are dismissed immediately without the possibility of returning. For me, football is a way of life. You have to be very professional: you can't just do it lightly. </p> <p>Our help in this way doesn't stop once the players become professional. Imagine, for example, the potential for Patrick Vieira. I hope, if he continues his progression, in two years he will be the best player in Europe, or even the world. It's all in his head. If he keeps his ambition, enthusiasm, will power, he will do that. If he stops, he goes down. It's our role, and that's where we come in, to tell them to be very demanding of themselves. </p> <p>At the heart of the French system is Clairfontaine, our base in a chateau outside Paris. It was a great decision to create a home for football, from the kids to the professionals. Clairfontaine helps to bring everyone together and unites the work and the philosophy of French football. It's a meeting place for the football family. Even the referees go there for a get-together every year. At the FFF, we put the collective ideal first. That was the hardest thing to put together. The French are well known for being individual, egotistical, Latin blooded. But football showed us victory is a collective effort. </p> <p>The day will come when England have to kick start themselves, when they realise things can't carry on as they are. Maybe you need to change some views, as we did. The job was so enormous it took us more than 10 years to do it. It takes about eight to 10 years to bring a player to maturity in football. </p> <p>I am not worried about England. It's a football country, the roots of football. I can't see why it couldn't quickly put together its own formula. It doesn't have to be like the French. One of our biggest mistakes was that we tried to copy what happened elsewhere. You have to take what's good for you but not an entire system. </p> <p>But first of all you have to want to do it. Everyone in football's family has to agree in this. Even in France we still have to fight every day to keep developing. Howard Wilkinson - a good friend of Gerard Houllier - knows how it works in France. But he may put something together that is even better than our system. </p> <p>Since I began to work here in 1992, we have benefited from what was done before. What we missed was to be winners. I arrived at a crossroads. The players coming through the system were well groomed, educated and - crucially - increasingly competitive. This is why in the Nineties we've improved, because French people are not naturally competitive. </p> <p>Our football was already moving in the right direction but there was a major setback in 1993, the famous elimination from the World Cup when Bulgaria stopped us from qualifying in the last minute. It put a stop to everything. I was part of that mission and I thought it was finished for me. We had lost, the coach and main man, Gerard Houllier, stepped down, we were really disappointed. But it helped us in the end, that defeat. We could sit down, understand and go forward. </p> <p>Sometimes you have to accept missing a big tournament to ensure a stronger long-term future. Sometimes you have to be more realistic. Your goals shouldn't be sky high straight away. In order to create the right dynamic between players and coaches you need to lower your immediate goals, to make sure everybody is working together. In our sport we need solidarity. You can't do it on your own. </p> <p>People were sceptical when I took over, because I was part of the team that lost. We learned from our errors, the mistakes we made preparing the team, relating to the players, in the way people were living day to day in the French team. Rather than look at winning the World Cup straight away you have to learn the basics, and do the basics. That's what we did. We did it when the press was really against us, even not very honest at times, but we never changed our route. </p> <p>People like Kevin Keegan, Franz Beckenbauer, all the greats, they are doubted all the time. But thank God for that, because it helps you to go forward. Doubts should be a positive not a negative thing. Positive doubts make us think about how to improve. </p> <p>You need patience, but you know for a fact that when you are at a high level nobody is prepared to wait. The only people who were ready to be patient were people from the football world, who appreciated what I was doing. Nobody else believed in us, that we could do something massive. The fans and the media didn't understand, which is normal. What I needed, and got, was the support and means to do my job properly. I did exactly what I wanted to do. All we knew was that we shouldn't waste time - we had a main goal, which was the World Cup coming to France. We always remained focused but it was hard because we had Euro 96 before the World Cup. </p> <p>First, I wanted to create a group dynamic to take to the European championship. I wanted to finish in the top four of Europe. We did that, and then we realised we had great players in the team. Seventeen of that team played in big European teams, but we had to make them play together and give them a style of play. That was really difficult between 1996 and 1998 because we didn't have any competitive games as World Cup hosts. </p> <p>Strength, enthusiasm, conviction. These are the fundamental qualities a coach requires if he aims to win the World Cup. If you don't have these three things then you can't go beyond yourself, which is what you must do to win something big. </p> <p>Last summer I had no frustrations watching the team win the European championship from the background. I was so happy that the players I put together achieved this amazing thing. It was wonderful. I lived the tournament much better than 98 because I was more of a fan, a friend, than the decision maker. Seeing the fruition of what I worked with since 1993 was an extreme satisfaction and happiness, probably more than if I was manager. </p> <p>Now we have big responsibilities to prepare for tomorrow and we have new ideas - essential if we need to progress. It's easier to get to the top than to stay there. Motivation hasn't stopped because we want to keep our World Cup in 2002. You always need new goals. We never think about the past, we think about the future because football is constantly progressing. Think about African football, Asian football, it's formidable. If we think in Europe we are the best, we are not going to be the best forever. It's like us being world champions - if we believe that we'll stand still and we want to win it again. </p> <p><em>Aim\u00e9 Jacquet was talking to Amy Lawrence</em>.</p>",
  "<p>The case of lecturer Richard Griffiths, cleared last week of raping a student in what seemed a classic example of date rape, proves just how dangerous the amorphous relationship between lecturers and students can be. </p> <p>We will probably never know what really happened that night but the intimate manner in which the two were socialising throws up questions about the delicate relationship between lecturers and students ignored for far too long already. </p> <p>There are no national guidelines covering such friendships. Teachers jeopardise their careers if they have affairs with schoolchildren, and doctors risk being struck off, but lecturers are subject only to the idiosyncratic rules of their employers. </p> <p>At first glance, this might seem reasonable: undergraduates are not underage schoolchildren after all and nor do they physically and mentally depend on their lecturers as patients do upon doctors. </p> <p>On the contrary, undergraduates are among the most intelligent members of society. They are mature enough to choose an academic discipline to inform their future and are free to choose their lifestyle, their politics and their friends. They wear clothes in which the majority of the population wouldn't be seen dead and abuse their health in ways they will struggle to recall for the rest of their lives. Surely, such paragons of empowerment and independence can choose who will share their bed? </p> <p>Well, yes and no. Undergraduates may give the impression that they are waterproof, bulletproof and bombproof but in reality, they are often the most vulnerable members of society. </p> <p>Undergraduates are told again and again that their college years will be - must be - the best of their lives. They expect to spend their days entangled in passionate and erudite debates and their nights in decadent transportations of delight. They expect to wade knee-deep in kindred spirits from freshers' week on and take it as read that they will discover the love of their life shortly afterwards. </p> <p>The reality is sharply and depressingly different. </p> <p>A study released last month found that one university student in six suffers from chronic loneliness during his or her first year, causing at least one quarter to consider leaving. </p> <p>Loneliness is the root cause of problems including self-doubt, poor physical health (exacerbated by being responsible for one's diet in an atmosphere where beer has precedence over bread) and depression. </p> <p>Take the typical female student then, isolated and upset and place her in a position of surprising intimacy - one to one in a small room, week after week and often late at night - with a male tutor who appears mature, concerned and in control. It should be no surprise to anyone that female undergraduates fall for their tutors in droves. </p> <p>Sometimes, of course, genuine relationships can blossom but even these must struggle to overcome the initial inequality where all power rested in the hands of the older man. </p> <p>At the moment, universities risk the ire of their staff if they attempt to dictate the type of relationship they can and cannot enter into with their students. The introduction of national guidelines, however, would give them the confidence and authority to stand their ground while ringfencing their right to interpret each case individually. </p> <p>Because it is not just students who would benefit from national guidelines: if a student accuses a tutor of abuse in the wake of a messy end to a genuine relationship, for example, the slur can devastate his career. Griffiths, unpleasant as he may be, has been found innocent but his days of teaching were over the moment his name hit the headlines. </p> <p>Whatever the truth of the tale, two lives have been ruined in the past week. National guidelines would have protected all of those involved as well as the thousands of students and lecturers who continue to tred the knife edge. Such misunderstandings should not happen again.</p>",
  "<p>Those three little words no one wants to hear: you have cancer. The depth of the dread is probably why so many of us know so little about it, preferring to muck around with myths and half-truths. Both my parents had it. My wife is fully recovered from a skin melanoma. One of my best friends survived bowel cancer in his mid-twenties. And still my ignorance was wilfully deep.</p> <p>Nor is it just us civilians who feel that way. \"Even the medical profession hides from the truth,\" the doctor in our family told me. </p> <p>\"I had an old and highly respected Harley Street specialist come to me and say he'd had bleeding from his rectum for some time - what might be wrong? Of course he knew it was colorectal cancer. He just didn't want to know. And when you tell people they have cancer, they ask as few questions as possible.\"</p> <p>So let's tackle the questions we all find so hard to ask - and uncover the truth behind some of our myths.</p> <p><strong> 1 You can catch it just like you catch a cold </strong></p> <p>No, it's not a droplet disease. Nor is it water-borne like, say, cholera. But it's possible to catch diseases and viruses which can lead to it. Around 15% of cancers worldwide are caused this way. Cervical cancer, for example, is virtually always (99.7%) a consequence of HPV, a sexually transmitted infection. Liver cancer is 100 times more likely in hepatitis B victims - which is why it's one of the few cancers where the Third World has a lead over us. The major risk factor is that babies are infected by their mothers. </p> <p><strong> 2 Flying gives you leukaemia</strong></p> <p>Only if you are a long-term commercial pilot - in which case you are five times more likely to get it. The effect is related to the high number of hours flown and only applies to those who have put in more than 5,000 hours. Even serial business flyers like Rupert Murdoch don't rack up hours like that, so it's a purely professional risk. It's most likely caused by cosmic radiation which increases with altitude. So the higher you fly, the more marked the effect - presumably Concorde pilots ran (or flew) the greatest risk. The link was established by Dr Hans Storm of the Institute of Epidemiology, Copenhagen. \"The only way to avoid it,\" he said, \"would be to limit the number of hours pilots are allowed to fly, just as they do with nuclear workers.\" Airline pilots are also three times as likely to get skin cancer, but that's because they take more holidays in the sun.</p> <p><strong> 3 City life gives you cancer</strong></p> <p>No, there is no difference in incidence rate between our towns and our countryside. The same doesn't seem to be true, though, for survival rates. An Aberdeen University study found that rural Scots with stomach cancer were four times more likely to die before it was diagnosed. For breast cancer, it's three times. Why? Because country dwellers have worse access to specialist care than their town cousins.</p> <p><strong> 4 It's man-made chemicals that are to blame</strong></p> <p>Not really. Epidemiologists look elsewhere for the causes, by and large. The BMA estimates that 1 per cent of cancers are caused by food additives. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) says no more than 1% of all cancers are a result of man-made chemicals. It's true that a 1999 German report and a more recent one by the US Environmental Protection Agency pointed the finger at dioxins, even coming up with a figure of their being responsible for 12% of human cancers in industrialised countries. Other scientists, while not disputing that dioxins are poisonous, doubt that they are ingested in sufficient quantities and point out that there is no causal link evidence. There is no real evidence of increased cancers in Seveso, site of the worst dioxin exposure and the much-vaunted leukaemia link with water pollution in Worcester, Massachusetts - as recounted in the movie A Civil Action - is almost certainly false. Staggeringly, a majority of US citizens, when polled by the Discovery Channel, said they thought air pollution carried as big a cancer risk as heavy smoking. That's pretty much on a level with thinking the moon's made of green cheese. Still, maybe it's no coincidence. Believing some nasty big business out there is to blame for cancer has two advantages - it stops being your responsibility and, perhaps more importantly in the lawyer-heavy US, it affords you the opportunity to sue the bejaysus out of them. </p> <p><strong> 5 There is more and more and more of it around</strong></p> <p>Well, yes, but this is mostly because more of us live longer. It's overwhelmingly a disease of age - nearly two-thirds of all cancers occur in the over-65s. Also, fewer of us are dying of other diseases - and, death being death, we've all got to die of something. Still, even the age-standardised rates have risen. From 1971 to 1997, levels rose 13% in men and 34% in women. More recently, though, there has been a significant decline in male cancer - down 5.75% since 1994. This is probably because of the long-term drop in lung cancer rates - down 33% from 1986 to 1997. Female cancers, though, have risen a little recently, but they're still below their 1992 peak. In the US, by the way, it's fallen even faster - 10% down overall since the 1992 peak. </p> <p><strong> 6 Every second person seems to have it</strong></p> <p>Almost. In the US, 48% of men and 37% of women will get cancer at some point during their life. The UK figure is a little lower. According to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF), just over one in three will get it, one in four will die of it. Currently, the male five-year survival rate is just 31%, while the female is 43%. Five years is the cancer experts' preferred definition of \"survival\".</p> <p><strong> 7 There was some blood in my stools for a bit, but then it stopped, so I haven't got cancer</strong></p> <p>Maybe, maybe not. Cancerous polyps do bleed intermittently. </p> <p><strong> 8 Cervical cancer is a promiscuity thing</strong></p> <p>Afraid so. The younger a woman is when she first has sex and the more sexual partners she has in her lifetime, the greater her chance of getting cervical cancer. That's because it's one of the few cancers caused by something you can catch. More than 99% of women who get it have the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Male promiscuity is also a major cause - women who've only had one partner also get HPV. Male promiscuity, combined with lower hygiene levels, is often the problem in the Third World - men catch HPV from prostitutes and infect their wives and lovers. Colombia, for example, has the world's highest rate. There is an HPV test, but trials have had varying results. In some, it's proved accurate. In others, it has produced a number of both false-positives and false-negatives - though the trials weren't large enough to establish whether the numbers were unacceptably large. As recently as September 1999, Dr Peter Sasieni of the ICRF said that adding it routinely \"would certainly lead to greatly increased costs without necessarily significantly decreasing the amount of cancers\". However, both he and the ICRF now believe \"that HPV testing holds great promise as a primary screening method. It has an abnormality detection rate of about 90%, compared with 75 or less for a smear test.\" Currently, it's being tested on borderline cases - still 250,000 a year. Cervical screening is already working. It cut cases by 42% between 1988 and 1997, and deaths have fallen by 50% in the last 15 years.</p> <p><strong> 9 Male circumcision prevents cervical cancer</strong></p> <p>There is some evidence for this. In India, Muslim women have a lower rate of cervical cancer than Hindus and Christians. It certainly seems to prevent penile cancer, which is virtually never seen in circumcised men.</p> <p><strong> 10 I've got genital warts: that means cervical cancer somewhere down the line, right?</strong></p> <p>Almost certainly not. When it comes to cervical cancer, if you can see the problem with the naked eye, it means you haven't got a problem. Nasty but true. More than 60 variants of HPV have been identified. Genital warts are produced by HPV Types 6 and 11, which have no link with cervical cancer. The danger ones are HPV 16, 18, 33, 35 and 45. The big problem is they're mostly \"silent\". Many of us have these HPVs, very few of us know it - a big deal when your chances with cervical cancer are directly related to the disease's progress by the time of diagnosis. Have a pap smear, basically. Because, in the words of the American National Cancer Institute, \"properly treated, tumour control of cervical cancer should be nearly 100%\".</p> <p><strong> 11 Extremely overweight people are more likely to develop it</strong></p> <p>Some American sources say there is a connection between obesity and cancer. The ICRF says the link is not clear. There are two exceptions, though. Obese women are three to five times more likely to get endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer and obese post-menopausal women run an increased risk of breast cancer.</p> <p><strong> 12 More men die of testicular cancer than women do of breast cancer</strong></p> <p>Not so. Testicular cancer is a very rare disease. It accounts for just one per cent of male cancers - in England and Wales in 1999, 71 died of it, compared with the 11,548 women who died of breast cancer. Incidence has doubled over the last 20 years - though it may now be on the decline since a 1996 peak. It is one of the few cancers that attacks the young. Nine out of 10 cases are in under-55s - and non-descended testicles by the age of seven is a strong indicator for it. The survival rate is excellent, however - almost 95%.</p> <p><strong> 13 OK then, more men die of prostate cancer than women of breast cancer</strong></p> <p>Wrong again, though the figures are a little closer. Breast cancer is the leading killer disease for women between 35 and 54. According to the Office for National Statistics, the lifetime risk is one in nine. Prostate cancer, by contrast, is a one in 14 shot - still 10,000 deaths a year, with a 41% survival rate. Breast cancer survival rates are rapidly improving, though. It kills some 13,000 British women a year, of the 35,000 who develop it. But that is far better than it was. Since the late 80s, when we had one of the lowest survival rates in Europe, deaths have fallen by 30%, faster than anywhere else in the world. That was from a very high starting point, though, so more women are still dying in Britain than in America, Australia and some of Europe.</p> <p><strong> 14 Breast cancer is killing more and more young women</strong></p> <p>Definitely not. Death rates have been reduced by 30% in young and middle-aged victims - mostly because of the efficacy of tamoxifen, a cheap and effective drug which blocks hormone receptors on cancer cells, interfering with their growth. It probably saves more lives than any other form of non-surgical cancer treatment. In younger women, chemotherapy after surgery has made a big difference to death rates.</p> <p><strong> 15 Left-handers are more likely to get breast cancer, so are virgins</strong></p> <p>Yes and yes. The left-hand difference - which is \"modest\" - was reported in the journal Epidemiology. A suggestion is that there is a link to the hypothesis that intrauterine exposure to steroid hormones may play a role in the development of breast cancer, as well as influencing handedness. Virgins are more likely to get it because they don't have children. Breast cancer is closely linked to oestrogen levels. Asian women in Asia, for example, have low levels of both - and British women high ones. Having babies, particularly when you're young, lowers the risk. By contrast, the fewer children you have, the greater your risk. Other risks are late menopause and having a first child after 30 - the older you are, the greater the danger. According to Dr Hilakivi-Clarke of the AICR, it now seems that the impact of high oestrogen levels varies through a woman's life. In the reproductive years, they have no effect at all. In the womb and after menopause, they increase the risk. During childhood, they now appear to play a \"powerful protective role\". </p> <p><strong> 16 Routine mammograms are a waste of time for over-65s</strong></p> <p>No, says the US. Yes, said the ICRF till just the other week - \"There is no good medical reason to justify the decision.\" No, it now says. In the last week of September, the government announced that routine screening would be extended to 65- to 70-year-olds by 2004.</p> <p><strong> 17 I've got a painful lump in my breast, so I must have cancer</strong></p> <p>Most likely not - 90% of breast cancer tumours are not painful, according to a clinician. It is far more likely to be an abscess, which is then always painful.</p> <p><strong> 18 Every man, if he lived long enough, would eventually get prostate cancer</strong></p> <p>Probably. The death toll has doubled over the last 20 years, and in 20 years' time, 50,000 men a year will get it. According to Dr Peter Sasieni, statistician for the ICRF, 40% of all 80-year-old men have it - this was established through post-mortems. Many won't know they've got it, as it develops slowly and they'll die of something else first. \"You can assume that the incidence increases with age. So if men lived to over 120 or so, it is possible they would all get prostate cancer.\" But not necessarily die of it. It looks as if there could well be a form of prostate cancer that just sits there and grows very slowly.</p> <p><strong> 19 The PSA test has transformed the survival rate for prostate cancer</strong></p> <p>The jury's out on this. In the US, prostate cancer deaths have dropped 10% since the early 90s - both experts and patient groups attribute this to the prostate-specific antigen test (PSA) which is a simple blood test. Experts here are nowhere near as convinced, pointing out the test's low accuracy level - it produces an unacceptable number of both false-positives and false-negatives. One of the big problems is figuring out whether a tumour is aggressive or not. New research seems to have pinpointed the eight genes which are responsible for the disease.</p> <p><strong> 20 Black Americans are more likely to get prostate cancer than whites</strong></p> <p> True. No one knows why. </p> <p><strong> 21 There's this Chinese herb stuff which really zaps prostate cancer</strong></p> <p>Absolutely. Western researchers call it PC-SPES. It's an over-the-counter powder supplement with eight different plants in it: isatis, liquorice, lucid ganoderma, pseudo-ginseng, rubescens, saw palmetto and scute. Research is at an early stage, but when rats on PC-SPES were injected with cancer cells, only 60% of them got tumours - compared to the usual 99. Lab tests by Dr Jan Geliebter of New York Medical College further showed that PC-SPES \"strongly inhibits\" the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture.</p> <p><strong> 22 So vegetarians get less cancer</strong></p> <p>No. Eating five portions of fruit and veg a day - whether you're a carnivore, a vegetarian or a vegan - is the thing that could keep Mr C away, or at least make him less likely to come calling. For 20 years, experts have pointed out that red meat and saturated fats are laden with the bad stuff - the chemicals that kick off the process which leads to cancer - while the good stuff is in fruit and vegetables: phytochemicals and antioxidants which fight it. The conclusion propounded was that meat-eating was the problem. Not so. A recent piece of research by the ICRF found that vegetarians are just as likely to die of bowel cancer as meat eaters. Nor was there any difference in breast, prostate, lung or stomach cancer. \"Our analysis suggests that meat itself may have little effect on the development of the disease,\" says the ICRF's Dr Timothy Key - a fairly categorical statement by scientific standards. Another study, by the US National Cancer Institute, found that people on a low-fat, high-fibre diet seemed to stand as much chance of developing pre-cancerous growths in their colons as those who steaked up and burgered out. But it's hard to know what to read into that. Questions are definitely begged. What do pre-cancerous growths, for example, have to say about cancerous ones? And what about cancers outside the colon? Still, a recent AICR expert review of 247 studies found that 78% showed that vegetables and fruit protected against cancer. So best keep having salad with those chips.</p> <p><strong> 23 Garlic beats cancer</strong></p> <p>A recent study-review by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) suggests that those who regularly eat garlic - raw or cooked - run half the risk of stomach cancer and two-thirds the risk of colon cancer. The AICR recommends eating two to five cloves a week or taking garlic supplements, though the UNC-CH found no benefit in supplements. Why does garlic help? The suggestion is it's because it attacks helicobacter pylori which is closely linked to stomach cancer.</p> <p><strong> 24 Fruit juice stops you getting cancer </strong></p> <p>It probably helps. A glass of juice counts as one portion of the five a day of fruit and vegetables that the WHO and other experts say will lower your risk. For these purposes, by the way, potatoes and nuts don't count as vegetables.</p> <p><strong> 25 Vegans, then. They get less cancer</strong></p> <p>They certainly have lower levels of IGF-I - Insulin-like Growth Factor-I - which increases the risk of prostate cancer. \"Even small differences are predictive,\" says Dr Timothy Key. Low levels are found in places where little meat or dairy products are eaten. An ICRF study revealed that IGF-I levels are 9% lower in vegans than in meat eaters. However, says an epidemiologist, \"studies with big leaps of faith - the technical term is 'proxy outcomes' - from a chemical to a disease don't get me too excited\".</p>",
  "Tony Blair was forced on to the defensive yesterday over an EU bid to stop governments cutting fuel tax. <p>The French-backed proposal to harmonise pump prices throughout Europe, which would have tied Britain's hands in the current petrol dispute, prompted a sharp Anglo-French clash. </p> <p>The plan to level out excise duties in countries and give Brussels control over member states' oil reserves was meant to prevent future fuel protests against national governments. </p> <p>The row erupted on the last day of an informal summit in Biarritz, designed as a warm-up for tough negotiations on European enlargement this December. </p> <p>Blair insisted it had been a successful session, adding: 'We gain nothing as a country from being marginalised and without influence in the leading strategic alliance right on our doorstep. </p> <p>'That policy of engagement and influence will continue. It is important not just for Europe but for the British national interest.' </p> <p>But minutes later he bluntly dismissed the suggestion of a new common oil strategy binding member states to 'resisting the temptation to offset oil price rises by cutting taxes'. </p> <p>Chancellor Gordon Brown is reviewing motoring costs in the run-up to his pre-Budget report, with the threat of renewed protests over the high cost of petrol. </p> <p>Blair insisted there was 'not the slightest possibility' of the European Commission's proposals gaining support, adding: 'I can tell you the other governments would not be talking about that either. I cannot believe that anybody is really interested in doing that.' </p> <p>Blair also insisted that the fundamental charter of human rights agreed at the summit, which includes the right to strike, would not be legally binding.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year the good citizens of various French cities, all of which were in the middle of being cabled up, were treated to a new kind of roadshow. Universal Studios Networks was doing the rounds to promote its horror channel and, somewhat bizarrely, had teamed up with Heinz to do this. </p> <p>The ketchup company was looking to target a younger audience, and linking its most famous product to a channel dedicated to dripping fangs was seen as the perfect vehicle for the product reorientation. The local press and radio stations loved the roadshow and gave it huge coverage. The marketing teams from Universal and Heinz went away well pleased. </p> <p>A gimmick, perhaps. But it is also symptomatic of the malaise at the heart of commercial television. The new dynamics affecting the industry are forcing advertisers to invent new ways of reaching consumers. </p> <p>The explosion of channels, coupled with new technologies such as video-on-demand - which whizzes what you want to watch down your phone line at the click of a remote - and Personal Video Recorders (PVRs) - set-top boxes which record your favourite programmes on a hard drive and have the ability to let you skip the ads - mean fewer and fewer people are going to watch television as they used to. </p> <p>Viewers will be able to build their own virtual television network instead, as new software works out what they like and records it for them to watch at their convenience. The Simpsons at 3:30am? No problem. </p> <p>'Television schedules will shift from a time-based paradigm to one based purely on content,' says Tim Fern, engineering director of Pace, a UK company which is set to launch its own PVR built into a set-top box next year. 'People will operate channels according to their own interests. It will have a dramatic effect on those general channels which are ad funded. Maybe this is the end for scheduling.' </p> <p>Another firm, US-based TiVo, has already launched its own PVR over here in conjunction with BSkyB. </p> <p>The television industry has been slow to wake up to what Jerel Whittingham, senior consultant with technology investment bank Durlacher, describes as an 'earthquake' or, in more prosaic terms, the shift from linear to non-linear TV. 'It was a struggle to get people to take it seriously,' Whittingham says. 'Many in the industry had no idea that people will record and watch the majority of their programmes in the future. It's such a different model that it takes a while for it to sink in.' </p> <p>The most dramatic consequence of this fragmentation of scheduling is the impending demise of mass-market advertising. 'It's the death of the channel. If most people are watching at different times, the channel is irrelevant,' Whittingham says. </p> <p>This means that those mainstream commercial channels which don't adapt to the non-linear world face major problems. 'Linear TV channels funded by conventional advertising will die,' says Stephen Adshead, of research firm Datamonitor. 'It's not going to happen overnight, but the conventional TV channels will lose out.' Datamonitor is soon to publish a report predicting that by 2005, some 21 million households in Europe will have video-on-demand, while 31 million will have PVRs. </p> <p>The PVR's ability to distinguish between programmes and ads poses serious problems for the conventional commercial broadcasting model which builds audiences around popular shows screened at key times of the day. The impact of technology that allows viewers to skip commercials will be greatest on the most popular shows. </p> <p>'These are the programmes that are most likely to be TiVo'd. It's appointment viewing,' says Tony Garland, president of Universal Studios Networks. </p> <p>But the broadcasters will find alternative revenues to compensate for the rise of the virtual television network. 'We've brought in a number of different types of control,' says Richard Cross, vice president of Interactive TV at NDS, the company that is cre ating the software for Pace's new range of set-top boxes. 'In some cases you will be able to skip the ads, perhaps if you pay a premium. In other cases you won't.' </p> <p>Fern paints a future in which viewers pay \u00a32.99 to watch a film without ads, or 99p to take it with commercials every 15 minutes. Or viewers could, for example, count the number of times the Budweiser logo features in a particular ad and, by getting it right at the end in a multi-choice quiz, win a free film-on-demand. 'In future you are effectively going to have to pay people to watch the ads,' Fern says. </p> <p>This may not be as difficult as it sounds. The new generation of devices will learn from their users' viewing habits, a process which will allow advertisers to target specific audiences because the boxes help build socio-demographic profiles of their viewers. </p> <p>Thus, the argument runs, viewers may end up watching only ads that are relevant to their lifestyles. 'If you don't have kids under the age of three, what's the point of watching an ad for nappies?' Fern asks. </p> <p>Garland argues that the complexity of programming following the death of the conventional TV channel paves the way for branded, niche, TV channels - such as Universal's horror channel. These would allow broadcasters 'to own an audience's heart rather than its eyeballs', creating loyalty ties which offer advertisers new ways of targeting discrete audiences. </p> <p>'For channels, victory is no longer in the volume of eyeballs,' says Garland. 'If your revenue is 100 per cent dependent on being able to deliver eyeballs at a particular time, then new technology is a threat. Audiences are going to fragment.' </p> <p>For commercial channels, this argument is nothing new. ITV (along with BBC1 and BBC2) has seen its market share slip as new chan nels have emerged over the past 20 years. Back in 1982, ITV (including GMTV) had a 50 per cent share of the viewing market. Last year the figure had plunged to 31 per cent, according to Barb - the British Audience Research Bureau. </p> <p>But this decline in eyeballs will increase dramatically as future generations of PVRs become ever more powerful. Currently they are capable of storing up to 60 hours of television; in five years' time they will store hundreds of hours. </p> <p>Analysts confidently predict the development of 'broadcasting portals' - themed menus which tell you where and when to find a particular programme. Fan of John Cleese? Check out the comedy portal - and the ads that go with it. </p> <p>This is known in the trade as 'disintermediation' - new technology allowing other businesses to step in between viewers and broadcasters. Commercial channels now need ensure that their programmes don't get lost in the virtual networks confusion, otherwise the advertisers will look elsewhere. </p> <p>As Cross put it: 'If you're a channel, the question you now have to ask is 'how do I get on the hard drive?' Advertisers will be asking them the same question.</p>",
  "<p>In 1937, the year Edith Wharton died aged 75, her work was consigned to oblivion by the left-wing critic, Herbert J. Muller, in his Modern Fiction: a Study in Values. He conceded that in The House of Mirth she 'made what in its day [1905] seemed a daringly realistic study of high society'. But after finding a few words of praise for Ethan Frome, her single excursion into working-class life, Muller declared that 'the bulk of her work concerns the doings of pallid gentlefolk and soon acquires the mustiness that has already sent The House of Mirth to the attic'. </p> <p>Well, Wharton and her books have long been recovered from the attic and the two most famous of them have been filmed with great distinction by Martin Scorsese and Terence Davies, blue-collar Catholics far removed from the patrician, Wasp world of Edith Wharton. Both have seen in her books the subtle perception and unflinching honesty of a writer who, from a position of confident success and social acceptance, could observe the hypocrisy, false values and cruelty of her own class. To write trenchantly, vividly on one society is to illuminate the idea of society in general. </p> <p>As he's demonstrated in the movies inspired by his Liverpool childhood and the non-autobiographical Neon Bible, Davies has a tragic, or at least stoical, view of life, and it was clearly not to escape from his customary gloom that he chose to film The House of Mirth. </p> <p>The title, which misleadingly suggests a funfair attraction, comes from Ecclesiastes ('The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; the heart of fools is in the house of mirth') and Edith Wharton regretted having adapted her first major literary success for the stage. 'I now doubt if that kind of a play, with a \"sad\" ending and a negative hero, could ever get a hearing from an American audience,' she wrote during its very brief Broadway run. In consoling her as they left the theatre, the critic and novelist William Dean Howells famously remarked: 'What the American public always wants is a tragedy with a happy ending.' </p> <p>The 29-year-old Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) follows on from Emma Bovary, Anna Karenina and Isobel Archer in the nineteenth-century tradition of self-deceiving heroines destroyed through a combination of oppressive social conventions and their own wilfulness. Lily is a 29-year-old orphan, beautiful, intelligent, witty, but dependent upon an allowance from a rich aunt and expected to secure her place in upper-class New York through marrying a rich man. </p> <p>This is a society in transition (old money is being challenged, or inveigled, by the nouveaux riches) that plays a deadly game with complex, unwritten rules which have nothing to do with ethics or morality. The consequences for losers are ostracism and banishment. </p> <p>Following Wharton's book with intelligent fidelity, the film goes to the heart of the matter with a superb opening encounter between Lily and her confidant, Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz), a hard-working lawyer with no inherited money. Like her, he lives through the hospitality of the rich. They love each other, but her ambition and his diffidence keep them apart. This lean sequence, which establishes character, milieu and values, concludes with Lily leaving Selden's apartment block and lying to its owner, the suave financier Rosedale (Anthony LaPaglia), that she's been seeing her dressmaker. </p> <p>This is the first of several hostages to fortune. As Davies forgoes an authorial commentary (one of the strengths of Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence, where Joanne Woodward spoke for Wharton), we are not told that Rosedale is a Jew. Viewers who haven't read the book may think him merely an edgily ambitious arriviste and not be aware that Lily shares the conventional anti-Semitism of her class. </p> <p>Though both Lily and Selden see through, and wittily mock, this society, they're trapped within it, in Lily's case because she lacks the skills and the political vision to break away. Ultimately, she's brought down and sent to an early grave by her decency, her vulnerability and her honesty. She rejects several wealthy suitors, falls into the hands of the blackmailing would-be seducer, Gus Trenor (Dan Aykroyd), is manipulated by a treacherous friend, the adulterous Bertha Dorset (Laura Linney) and cheated by a hypocritical cousin, (Jodhi May). </p> <p>To tell this complex story, Davies steers a course somewhere between the luxurious explicitness of Merchant-Ivory - whose admirable, not dissimilar, The Golden Bowl opens next month - and the metaphoric, elliptical, expressionist style of his previous pictures. The action proceeds through a succession of dialogues where, except in the exchanges between Lily and Selden, the real subject under discussion only occasionally disrupts the polite surface. The truth is to be found in glances and a shift in the eyes, and his whole cast serve Davies admirably. </p> <p>The movie draws for its visual style on the contemporary paintings of John Singer Sargent and James Tissot (whose work is used for the covers of several Virago editions of Wharton), but Davies, who shot all the American material on artfully dressed Scottish locations, doesn't parade the period detail. The decor is always in the background. </p> <p>The eclectic use of music is typical of Davies, but the most obviously characteristic sequence is a transition from the States to the Mediterranean where Lily is to be undone. It begins with a series of tracking shots though the dust-sheet-covered furniture of a mansion, followed by the camera moving rapidly over a rain-splattered lake that gives way to the sun catching smooth, sun-dappled water as the prow of a yacht breaks through the sea, and finally the camera pans up to buildings on the cliffs of Monte Carlo. An episode to cherish.</p>",
  "<p><strong> When did you realise you wanted to get involved in film?</strong> </p> <p>After I graduated from high school I was studying writing at the New School for Social Research in New York. But I kept skipping classes. So I dropped out and went to a local community college in New Jersey. I had already worked at a string of convenience stores, and then I saw a listing in the paper for a video store clerk. And I thought, 'God, that I would love to do! What a great job sitting there controlling the ebb and flow of movies in this region, making sure the right people get the right movies.' </p> <p><strong> Was there a particular epiphany for you?</strong> </p> <p>My interest in film developed at the video shop. I starting going to film festivals and at one of those I saw Richard Linklater's film Slacker. It inspired me, not least because it was an ultra low-budget film made by someone like me. Then I looked at films by Hal Hartley and Jim Jarmusch which had a similar effect. So then I started looking at film schools because I knew that I needed to learn some technical skills. I saw an advert in the Village Voice for the Vancouver Film School. It had a 0800 number so it was worth a call - and they told me it was an eight-month programme that cost $9,000. They said: 'What we do is teach you hands-on; you get your hands on the equipment, you make films. We skip the theory element of most film schools.' That sounded good to me. </p> <p><strong> Did you make any films while you were at this school?</strong> </p> <p>Just one documentary. The course wasn't all it was cracked up to be and I went home after four months. The best thing that happened there was that I met my future producer, Scott Mosier, and my cinematographer, David Klein. </p> <p>I had to be resourceful if I wanted to be a filmmaker. So I followed the example of guerrilla filmmaker Robert Rodriguez who made El Mariachi for $7,000. He'd said: 'Take stock of what you have and work with that. I had a bus and I had a turtle, so I worked them both into the script!' I thought, I can get my hands on a convenience store. I went home, and got my job back at the convenience store, fully intending to shoot the film there. </p> <p><strong> What did you do about raising money?</strong> </p> <p>I certainly didn't want to take my 164-page script to potential investors and say, 'Do you have any cash?' I mean, 164 pages of dick jokes at a convenience store? Luckily, I had secured about a dozen credit cards over the last couple of years. I would apply saying that I was manager of RST Video and I made $50,000 a year. They'd call the video store to check. I would answer the phone: 'Yeah?' 'We're checking out a credit loan for Kevin Smith, the manager.' 'Oh. He makes $50,000 a year.' They'd say, 'Excellent!' and hang up. But suddenly I looked at these cards as a means of financing Clerks . </p> <p><strong> How did you find your camera equipment?</strong> </p> <p>Kodak had a programme for film school students where you were given 15 per cent off your film stock. Unfortunately, they only accepted people from the city so our Vancouver IDs weren't valid. Undeterred, we went down to the New School for Social Research and enrolled on a one-day course so we could get an ID card. It was called 'Roasting Suckling Pig' and the fee was $50. I signed on, and bought the film while the card was still warm from the laminating machine! Then we went back and I took my name off the course. We couldn't afford to spend $50. We rented an old clunky Arriflex SR camera. It was so loud we had to throw a leather jacket on it during filming. The shop wouldn't take credit cards, only cash. So I told my parents, 'We need $3,000 now, otherwise we can't get the equipment.' They were not well off, but somehow managed to put together some cash they had saved. </p> <p><strong> Did you have much technical knowledge?</strong> </p> <p>I hadn't stayed long enough to learn any technical knowledge at Vancouver. Thankfully Scott and David had, so David handled the camera and Scott operated the sound. Periodically David would set up the frame and ask, 'What do you think of this?' And I'd look through the lens and go, 'It looks wonderful.' Originally, I had wanted to shoot in colour, but Scott told me that we would have to rent an entire light package. If we shot in black and white we could use the store's fluorescent lights. </p> <p><strong> Were you working at the same time?</strong> </p> <p>Scott and I worked in the convenience store and the video store during the entire shoot. I would work the six till 11am shift. From 11 to five we were either sleeping or preparing for the next night's shooting. From five or six till 10.30 at night I was working again. Then from 10.30 till six in the morning we would shoot the movie. And then the day would begin again. Sometimes we would end a little earlier than 6am and we would go and sleep next door in the video store. We had pillows and some blankets and went and slept on the floor in the video store. We brought an editing unit into the video store so we could film and edit simultaneously. Scott would edit while I worked in the convenience store and vice versa. </p> <p><strong> What was the hardest thing about the shoot for you?</strong> </p> <p>At the start we had a crew of 10 people working for nothing. By the end of the first week, though, we were down to four people as the process was so boring. But the hardest thing was finding people to fill the small roles. In the final version, my friend Walter plays four roles; in the first cut he played five! We just kept changing his appearance. He just kept on popping up in the movie because he was around. Walter didn't go to sleep until early in the morning, about four or five or something. And every time somebody didn't show up for one of the roles, we were like, 'Walter, throw this jacket on.' </p> <p><strong> Was it exciting to see your film take shape and see the reactions?</strong> </p> <p>I loved the first cut of the movie. We made a poor quality video copy of it and watched it at my friend Ed's house. Just really revelled in it! The feeling was 'Wow! We made a flick! That's kind of cool!' I wanted to screen at the IFFM [Independent Feature Film Market]. That's where Richard Linklater had initially taken Slackers . We were given the Sunday morning graveyard slot. There were about 10 people in the theatre and most of them were the cast and crew! I was distraught. I couldn't believe I had spent 27 grand and nobody turned up. But Bob Hawke, one of the leading lights of the independent scene, was present. He liked the film and told a number of his contacts in the film world. Through him we got in contact with filmmakers' agent John Pierson, who had previously sold She's Gotta Have It and Roger and Me. He watched the film and agreed to represent us. </p> <p>Then we got accepted into the Sundance Film Festival, beating 600 other movies. The ending posed a problem, though. In the original a guy comes into the store and shoots Dante [the lead character] dead and robs the store. John said, 'You can't grow to love this character and then kill him because you didn't know how to end the movie.' He was insistent so we cut it before Sundance. </p> <p><strong> How did it go at Sundance?</strong> </p> <p>We had four successful screenings. It was the first time we saw the movie with a full audience and to hear the cacophonous laughter, the roaring, was a deeply satisfying feeling. But still no distributors were interested in buying the film. Then Harvey Weinstein saw it and loved it. John arranged a meeting with Harvey. He said, 'You made a fucking funny movie. I'll take it and put it on a bunch of fucking screens, show it to the right fucking people, put a fucking soundtrack in there_' Scott and I were impressed. He was our kind of guy: very blunt and very frank. So he made us an offer. The sum was very low, only $227,000. Twenty-seven grand would cover the hard cost of the movie, not the interest on the credit cards. And then we were left with a $100,000 to split between us and all the people on the cast.

  "<p><strong>Silence in October</strong><br>Jens Christian Gr\u00f8ndahl<br>Canongate \u00a39.99, pp272</p> <p> The plot of Jens Christian Gr\u00f8ndahl's fine novel is simple: a woman walks out of a successful marriage, leaving her husband to mull over their shared past. He can follow her movements (she has gone to Portugal, a place of memory for them both), although she doesn't communicate directly. It's as if she's sending him clues, in the unusual medium of credit card records, about a mysterious crisis of which he had no inkling. </p> <p>Tim Winton, in The Riders, his Booker-shortlisted novel of five years ago, used a similar situation as his starting point, but what he was writing was a sort of adventure thriller, whose Holy Grail was the female heart. The more cerebral, unnamed narrator of Silence in October doesn't set off in pursuit of the missing Astrid. He fulfils his professional and social engagements, a trip to New York, a party, his monstrous actress mother's latest premiere. But all the time he obsessively mulls over his emotional history. </p> <p>Both he and Astrid are in their mid-forties, their two children (one Astrid's by a previous marriage) now independent. It's a tribute to Gr\u00f8ndahl's rigorous imagination that the story should have so little in common with banal narratives of mid-life crisis or empty-nest syndrome. His narrator may be an art historian, but his broodings have a philosophical force for all their fluency. </p> <p>The narrator particularly admires the work of the New York school of painters (Rothko and Pollock among them). When he stands before their work, he feels that 'their absolute presence, devoid of references, demanded my own presence, a concentration without thought, resting in the centre of the eye's gravity, precisely here, exactly now'. Here, as so often, Anne Born's translation seems to render more than the bare bones of a style, its flesh tones, even. </p> <p>The narrator acknowledges that in a certain sense he has gone missing from his marriage long before Astrid made her move, but he isn't naive enough to inhabit some ideal of 'being here now' - that's the privilege of art exclusively. As Astrid's job announces perhaps a little obtrusively (she's a film editor), the stories we tell ourselves about our choices and where they have brought us owe their coherence to everything we snip out. The continuity of our selves is just that, continuity in the cinematic sense, a suppression of discrepancies. Love discovers its reasons only retrospectively. Earlier personalities nevertheless persist within both husband and wife, but what is their status - fossils, ghosts, hostages? </p> <p>One of Gr\u00f8ndahl's recurring quirks is to resist, in his phrasing, the conventional attribution of cause and effect. The narrator describes his excitement at seeing 'the words pull themselves out of the chink at the end of my fountain pen in long, vibrating, wavy blue ribbons of damp signs that dried into the paper'. He remembers watching Astrid 'as the glow ate its way through the cigarette between her lips'. Casting a cold eye on his mother, he notices 'the hanging corners of her mouth around the lips that had kissed so many men and allowed the words of so many writers to pass through her mouth'. The words do the writing, a cigarette smokes itself, the script delivers the actress. These games echo the novel's larger unpicking of the apparently self-evident. </p> <p>There's a definite whiff of existentialism about the narrator's attempts to root out the bad faith he brought to his marriage along with the good, and to re-establish himself in authenticity of feeling. Perhaps it's only a northern-European Protestant tradition of self-scrutiny - the tradition which threw up Denmark's proto-existentialist theologian Kierkegaard.</p> <p>That the obligation to know yourself is the deflection of a religious imperative is shown by one sentence in particular. The narrator is troubled by an old girlfriend's apparently straightforward question - is he happy? - and teases out its implications. Was the source of his upset 'that I was neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm, and so spat the question out of my mouth instead of answering?' In Revelations III: 15 it is God, confronted with one who is 'lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot', who does the spitting ('I will spue thee out of my mouth'). </p> <p>So much more of Silence In October is made up of memory and introspection than action that the transitions back to the present tense are sometimes awkward. Around the three-quarters mark, the book converges on the more standard territory of the novel of adultery, without ever quite sacrificing its analytical intensity. There is no shortage of details, evocations of mood and sensation, but Gr\u00f8ndahl seems most in his element extrapolating from them. </p> <p>Michel Tournier, describing his own transformation from philosopher to novelist, wrote that it was like a munitions works having to retool at the end of hostilities to make fridges. There's something about Silence in October, for all its depth of finish, of a hybrid product - a fridge with a gun turret, perhaps.</p>",
  "Was Britain's greatest crime-writer and creator of the world's best-known detective novel also a killer and adulterer? The allegations have been dismissed as 'ludicrous' by the Sherlock Holmes Society, but now author Rodger Garrick-Steele is hoping to prove his case beyond doubt with the proceeds of a film planned on the subject. <p>For 11 years he has gathered evidence to show that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle actually poisoned a man whose work he then plagiarised. The modern-day sleuth plans to have the alleged victim's body exhumed and tested to prove his theory. </p> <p>Garrick-Steele says Doyle's immortal The Hound of the Baskervilles was mostly written by Bertram Fletcher Robinson, one-time editor of the Daily Express. Commentators have noted similarities with a 1900 book by Robinson but Garrick-Steele goes further and says Robinson was hired as a ghost writer for the 1901 Baskervilles book. </p> <p>Doyle had not written a book since killing off Holmes 10 years earlier. He hated his detective writing saying 'it takes my mind from better things'. Reluctant to resurrect the pipe-smoking Holmes, he was none the less tempted by the money. </p> <p>When the first edition of The Hound of the Baskervilles appeared, the dedication read: 'My dear Robinson. It was your account of a West Country legend which first suggested the idea of this little tale to my mind. For this, and for the help which you gave me in its evolution, all thanks. A Conan Doyle.' </p> <p>The dedication was toned down in later editions. </p> <p>But, according to Garrick-Steele, Conan Doyle not only stole Robinson's work - he also had an affair with his wife. His most controversial allegation is that he then used her to help him kill Robinson when he feared professional and personal exposure. </p> <p>The claims met scepticism from Conan Doyle's admirers. </p> <p>'We were all wondering what was going on and there was some furious emailing back and forth but we now think his claims are speculation,' said Roger Johnson of the Sherlock Holmes Society. Nick Utechin, radio producer and editor of the society's newsletter, describes Garrick-Steele's claims as 'ludicrous'. </p> <p>'I honestly can't say this research is worth anything at all. There is no doubt that the bones of the Baskerville story came from Robinson but there is no evidence that I can see that he had an affair with his wife and went on to murder Robinson,' he said. </p> <p>Garrick-Steele will this week sign over the rights to his 11-year investigation to a Hollywood film company. He says he will use some of the profits to prove that Robinson died not of typhoid as his wife had claimed, but of laudanum (a tincture of opium) poisoning. </p> <p>Robinson was buried in 1907 at St Andrew's Church in Ipplepen, Devon, but modern toxicology could detect poison in his remains. </p> <p>'Nobody wants to dig poor Bertram up but this money provides an unmissable opportunity to let his spirit rest by proving foul play,' Garrick-Steele said. </p> <p>Last month, Garrick-Steele angered Scotland Yard detectives after he tipped them off about 'a murder case'. </p> <p>'Had Mr Garrick-Steele said his suspicions concerned a death which occurred 100 years ago and that one of his suspects was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, we would not have taken any action whatsoever,' said Detective Chief Superintendent Brian Moore. Despite lack of police interest, the circumstantial evidence that Garrick-Steele has found is compelling. </p> <p>Conan Doyle was a violent man, a bully as a child who later terrorised his own children. Robinson met him when he tried to stop a fist fight started by the author. </p> <p>His family background was far from normal. As a young man Conan Doyle and his mother Mary had his father Charles committed to a mental institution in their native Edinburgh. Conan Doyle, a qualified doctor, signed the papers. Charles died there, after years trying to prove his sanity and writing a perfectly lucid diary. </p> <p>Mary remained her son's confidante and they exchanged 1,500 letters before her death in 1920. </p> <p>Garrick-Steele, a former psychologist, speculates that Conan Doyle's affair with Gladys Robinson may have been born out of her desperation to have a child. Conan Doyle was her neighbour in London. </p> <p>The unstable Conan Doyle might have feared professional exposure and scandal over their affair and persuaded Gladys to poison her husband with laudanum. The effects could have been mistaken for typhoid. </p> <p>The death of Robinson, one of Britain's first war correspondents, was completely unexpected. He was a fit, well-off 34-year-old. Typhoid proved fatal in those days in only about 15 per cent of cases. No doctor was called until a day after he had died and the death certificate was completed with information provided by Gladys. She said he had had typhoid for 22 days and she had nursed him. </p> <p>But two days later she told a friend he 'contracted food poisoning in France and was dead within eight days'. She did not attend his funeral. </p> <p>Garrick-Steele began his research after buying Parkhill House in Devon, the former Robinson home. </p> <p>'The problem was the success of The Hound of the Baskervilles,' he said. A US publisher offered Doyle $44,000 to write a new Holmes series, but 'his first manuscript was rejected. It simply wasn't up to the standard of Baskervilles. So he turned to Robinson again,' Garrick-Steele says. 'Robinson would no doubt have blown his stack [over being uncredited for his work on the famous book] leaving Doyle terrified that the whole sorry affair would leak out. </p> <p>'His reputation was at stake. I believe he blackmailed Gladys into slowly poisoning Bertie.' </p> <p>Since Robinson has no living descendants, Garrick-Steele will have to convince a coroner that an exhumation is of historical worth. </p> <p>Doyle, however, may already have given his defence against the allegations. In 1886 he criticised reaction to the death of Thomas Carlyle, saying: 'As long as he was alive, who cared to breathe a word against him? </p> <p>'The moment that the old lion lay still and silent, however, there was no jackal too small to take a snap or a pinch at him.'</p>",

In fact, he rewrote it in 1936, but it wasn't published until 1985 when it was found among the author's papers, two years after his death. It has come to be regarded as something of a lost classic. </p> <p>The Road to Los Angeles is the first of Fante's quartet of novels featuring his alter ego, Arturo Bandini, a young Italian immigrant living in a suburb of LA and drifting through a series of menial jobs while dreaming of becoming a writer. Bandini is a sympathetic, often unlikeable, but strangely pitiable character; his aspirations and awareness of his own shortcomings and social position are manifested in arrogance, pomposity and cruelty to those around him, especially his mother and sister. </p> <p>Fante's prose is spare and simple, in direct contrast to Bandini's loquacious narrative voice and the flights of his imagination, in particular, his sexual fantasies over photographic magazines or the afternoon spent shooting crabs while re-enacting a revolution. </p> <p>John King's brief introduction reminds us that Fante founded a distinctive school of gritty American writing, his most prominent disciple being Charles Bukowski who said: 'Fante was my god.' Fante's humour is as fresh as it was when the book was written nearly 70 years ago.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay</strong><br>Michael Chabon<br>Fourth Estate \u00a312, pp544<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000241454,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Comic books and magic tricks can mean more that just ballooning muscles and gag gifts - or so Michael Chabon thinks, as he brings us to a time and place where intellect and mystery find their way into these two often overlooked art forms. Jewish mysticism meets Americana in his novel The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, and we find all this in the comic-book superhero, the Escapist, who is the creation of the wonderful pair of Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay. </p> <p>Josef Kavalier first makes the acquaintance of his cousin, Sammy Klayman, late one night in 1939. He has managed to escape from Prague, with the help of his magic teacher, Bernard Kornblum, but has had to leave his family behind after the German occupation of the city. Chabon brings Jewish mysticism from Prague to Brooklyn in the form of the Golem.</p> <p>The Golem is 'Rabbi Loew's mysterious automaton', whom, centuries back, Rabbi Loew conjured out of mud to save the Jewish people from destruction. As the story goes, after the Golem begins to cause his own forms of destruction, Rabbi Loew buries the Golem's clay body in case he is ever needed again. When the Germans occupy Prague in the Thirties, a committee of Jewish elders decides that the Golem's body must be sent away to protect it and his coffin becomes the means of departure for Josef. Stashed in the bottom, Josef escapes to his aunt's home in Brooklyn. </p> <p>Josef and Sammy discover their compatible artistic and narrative talents and convince Sammy's boss, Sheldon Anapol - head of Empire Novelty, soon to become Empire Comics - to start distributing comic books, which Josef and Sammy will create. Desperate to help his own family escape, Josef hits upon an idea for a new superhero with Sammy. Their hero is the Escapist, a masked man in tights who can perform daring acts of chain-breaking, lock-loosening and other feats of liberation. The Escapist, while a typical superhero in appearance, serves an additional purpose: he fights Hitler and the Nazis to liberate the Jews and other oppressed peoples. The Escapist takes off - and Josef and Sammy become Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay, Americanising their names to become a great comic book team. </p> <p>Best known for Wonder Boys, his novel turned film, Chabon's greatest skill lies in his combination of imaginative fiction and practical research. His prose, however, is neither fluid nor flawless. Joe's faltering English often seems unrealistically so; some of Chabon's secondary characters blur in the background of comic-book action heroes and artists. </p> <p>But what does make his novel an adventure wholly worth undertaking is the endearing and mysterious Joe, the misunderstood Sam, and their own personal and professional journeys. You read through Joe's angry anti-German stage, where he deliberately picks fights with any German-sounding or Nazi-thinking person he meets. You read eagerly as Joe falls in love with Rosa Saks, daughter of art magnate Longman Harkoo, and as she turns him into a softer man who puts all of his preciously saved salary (the comic business has been lucrative) into an account for his family. You read on as Sam falls for Tracy Bacon, an actor who plays the Escapist in the radio version of the story, and as Sammy realises that he is afraid to admit his love for another man </p> <p>To divulge any more would be cruel. Suffice to say that Joe and Sam and Rosa retain their own demons; the war takes its toll on all of them. But what remains impressive about this novel is Chabon's ability to find a comic book character who so describes the time and place about which he writes. And in telling all of this, he's written an adventure story that keeps you up until 4am with the bedside lamp on, eager to learn if the Escapist, and Chabon himself, can free the enslaved and lead them home.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Vogue Women </strong><br>Georgina Howell<br>Pavilion \u00a325, pp192</p> <p>Georgina Howell's Vogue Women is a coffee-table book with a message. It claims to show, in nearly 200 pages of glamorous portraits, how the place of women in society has altered over the past century. Not ordinary women, you understand - only, as it were, society women in society. These are photographs taken for the pages of Vogue magazine: politics has no place, and those of less fortunate physique must be 'edited', as Howell explains, before they are ready for their close-up. Whatever else these people may have done, the camera has already loved them. </p> <p>The aim of Vogue, Howell writes, has always been to 'induce aspiration', which sounds more like a painful medical procedure than a wistful daydream. The women in this book reflect not just fashion, it is supposed, but the changing shape of who we have wanted to be. This sounds a rather promising thought: might some new information be revealed by leafing through a series of over-familiar images of Coco Chanel, Princess Diana, Josephine Baker and Vivien Leigh? </p> <p>The answer, inevitably, is no. The hypothetical 'we' of the aspiring public must, for the most part, be a fallacy. No matter what decade or century they live in, some people will always wish they looked more like Grace Kelly, while others prefer Stella Tennant. Even Edith Sitwell has had her fashionable followers. Aspiring to be Jackie Kennedy was not the same as aspiring to be Marilyn Monroe, at exactly the same moment in history. Generalisations simply cannot be made. 'We opened the century wanting to look like aristocrats or actresses,' Howell proclaims, 'and ended it wanting to look like television presenters and the wives of football stars.' Is there a little snobbery to be detected in the comment, a sniffy woe at the extinction of the British aristocracy and its replacement by Victoria Beckham? </p> <p>Howell, a distinguished fashion editor and journalist, seems quite attached to the days when debutantes were 'backed like racehorses'. At one time, she suggests, the purpose of beauty was to attract a husband, and so good looks 'cultivated happy families'; now beauty only leads to depression - she cites Monroe and Diana as evidence. The stories Howell appears to cherish most are those of high-class unions - who married Aly Khan or the Marquis de la Falaise; who snapped up a count or a duke.</p> <p>The way she tells it, you could be forgiven for thinking that women's aspirations haven't changed at all: the time-honoured ambition to ensnare a rich man cuts right across the century - so much so that one wonders where the Sixties went. Elizabeth Taylor, an icon of more tucked-in times, memorably illustrates the point when she is quoted as saying, 'I don't think you have to burn bras. I like bras, and I love lace underwear!' </p> <p>The book contains a token section on women who have actually done things - Bridget Riley and Martha Graham are here, along with Marina Warner and Rebecca West - but in the main it is filled with women famous for being 'beauties'. As if to prove that it would not otherwise be a pleasant viewing experience, Vogue Women bundles the unbeautiful into a double-page spread so horrific it should be preceded by a warning: don't look now, it's Margaret Thatcher and Mother Teresa. A 'beauty' in Vogue terms is not just someone who is beautiful. She is, Howell explains, 'a recognised phenomenon', a person seen in the right places with the right people. This is beauty as conspiracy theory; it is in the eye of the beholder, and not just any beholder will do. </p> <p>Of course, the author is faithfully representing the ethos of the magazine, and her familiarity with its history yields some good anecdotes. Mrs Exeter, for example, was a fictional character invented by the editors in the Sixties, who was designed to prevent the alienation of older readers at a time when all was bent on youth. While David Bailey shot Jean Shrimpton sprawling on the floor, while sex was plastered over every fashion page, Mrs Exeter went to christenings in sombre suits. Howell also quotes a wonderful coverline from an old back issue: 'Is Ageing Really Necessary?' - a phrase which combines the narcissistic anxiety of the society girl with the indomitable impatience of the British schoolmistress. </p> <p>But this book is really about the pictures. Many are familiar old favourites, but some are startling. There is a shot of Uma Thurman's mother, Nena, a favourite model of Norman Parkinson, leaning against a white sports car in 1958, looking like a thin sliver of her daughter. There is Lee Radziwill, more perfect than Jackie; Jeanne Moreau, close up with a cigarette; Gwyneth Paltrow, looking modern, healthy and much less prim then usual. </p> <p>Some of the most beautiful shots in the book are barely photographs of women at all: they are fashion pictures, portraits of a line, a look, a colour scheme. Parkinson photographed Adele Collins at the end of the Fifties, in front of an antique embroidered wall-hanging; the background is in focus, in all its shabby luxury, and in the foreground is a blur, a swathe of vivid red from a hat, a spot of lipstick in the same colour and, in between, on a powder-pale face, the soft black outlines of two eyes. It is as if the girl had been painted in watercolour and was now drowning somewhere, her contours wearing off. Or maybe that's just what happens to women when they aspire too much.</p>",
  "President Bill Clinton yesterday announced that he will fly to Egypt tomorrow in a desperate bid to end two weeks of Israeli-Palestinian violence that threatens to plunge the region into full-scale conflict. <p>Clinton said he would attend the emergency summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik, following confirmation from both Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that they would meet face to face in an attempt to negotiate a ceasefire in the violence that has claimed more than 100 largely Palestinian lives and seen thousands injured. </p> <p>A grim-faced president told a hastily convened White House press conference that he 'would do everything to minimise the violence and to do all the preparation necessary to maximise the chances of a successful meeting'. </p> <p>The announcement that both sides were prepared to attend the summit comes after furious efforts by the US president and other senior international figures over the past eight days to end the crisis in the Middle East, where a lasting peace has been a priority for his administration. </p> <p>As violence continued across Israel and the Palestinian Territories the question being asked was whether either Barak or Arafat was in a position to control extremists in their numbers. </p> <p>And in one of the biggest gambles of his long leadership of the Palestinian people Yasser Arafat agreed yesterday that he would attend despite Israel's refusal to accede to his demand that an independent international commission of inquiry into the violence be established. </p> <p>Arafat's agreement to talk peace without conditions is a highly risky strategy as mood among Palestinians appears to be hardening against any hint of concessions to Israel whose forces have been responsible for the vast majority of the fatalities. </p> <p>Many now believe that Arafat has been too hasty already in his negotiations with Israel both in the Oslo Peace deal in 1993 and in the Wye Valley agreement that saw the PLO abandon its commitment to destroying the Israeli state. </p> <p>UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, who has been in the region for a week brokering an end to the bloodshed, said the summit would take place in Egypt today or tomorrow, and without preconditions. </p> <p>Speaking yesterday Annan said: 'There were no preconditions. There were suggestions.' Each side was quick to name those 'suggestions'. </p> <p>Nabil Shaath, a senior Arafat aide, said the Palestinians expected an Israeli retreat from the edge of Palestinian-controlled towns, and the loosening of a closure that would allow medicine and food into the Palestinian areas. </p> <p>Not appearing on anyone's list was the Palestinian demand to convene an international inquiry into the reasons for the violence. </p> <p>Barak had adamantly rejected that condition, saying that he only trusted the United States to lead such an inquiry. </p> <p>Barak's office said the summit would not treat the substantive peace issues that have been all but waylaid by the violence. Instead, he suggested the summit would formalise a ceasefire. </p> <p>The announcement came as Annan said he had called on both sides to cease shooting, which was yesterday being ignored. </p> <p>'I have asked both sides to stop firing until the summit,\" he said. </p> <p>Annan said he expected Clinton and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to work out the details. </p> <p>In Washington, a White House spokesman said Clinton was awaiting word from President Mubarak 'as to whether he feels the conditions are in place to convene a summit'.</p>",
  "The Middle East crisis took a sinister new twist yesterday when a London-bound Saudi jet carrying 95 passengers, mostly Britons, was seized by a hijacker armed with high explosives. <p>The plane, which was also carrying a Saudi prince, had taken off from Jeddah yesterday afternoon. It is reported to have stopped off in Damascus briefly before heading for Baghdad last night. </p> <p>The hijacker was thought to be operating alone on the plane, and while in Damascus had threatened to blow it up if he was not allowed to fly on to Iraq. </p> <p>The dangerous ratcheting up of tension came as President Clinton launched a desperate bid to rein in the violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by announcing that he would fly to Cairo today for a summit, bringing together Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. </p> <p>Flight SV115 from Jeddah, with a crew of 17, had been due to land at Heathrow at 5.40pm yesterday, but at 1.55pm, as the Boeing 777-200 left Egyptian air space, the pilot told the control tower at Cairo airport he was being forced to fly to Baghdad by a hijacker. </p> <p>'The plane had entered Cypriot airspace, and radio contact was lost after that,' said an Egyptian civil aviation authority official. </p> <p>Later the captain told the control tower at Larnaca, Cyprus: 'The hijacker is saying that he has TNT [explosives] on board and he might blow the aircraft, and we have passengers from all kinds of nationalities.' </p> <p>Syrian authorities had initially denied the plane permission to land, forcing it and its passengers into an agonising holding position above the eastern Mediterranean. The plane was reported to have been on the tarmac at Damascus for about an hour before heading for Iraq, where it landed at about 6pm (GMT). </p> <p>The Saudi Aviation Minister said last night that most of the passengers were Britons but some were from South Africa and Yemen. </p> <p>Heathrow authorities had last night set up an emergency room in Terminal Three for families and friends who had come to greet the passengers off the plane. </p> <p>Saudi Arabian Airlines were unable to say how many terrorists were involved in the hijack plot or what their demands were. </p> <p>There was speculation last night that the hijackers were Islamic fundamentalists opposed to the Saudi stance in the Middle East crisis, and could be linked to the terrorist Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>As the hijack drama unfolded, Clinton announced he would attend an emergency summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik, following confirmation from both Barak and Arafat that they would meet face to face to attempt to negotiate a ceasefire to end the fighting that has claimed more than 100 lives in recent weeks. </p> <p>As violence continued across Israel and the Palestinian Territories the question being asked was whether either Barak or Arafat was in a position to control extremists in their numbers. </p> <p>And in one of the biggest gambles of his long leadership Arafat agreed yesterday to attend the summit despite Israel's refusal to accede to his demand that an independent international commission of inquiry into the violence be established. </p> <p>Arafat's agreement to talk peace without conditions is a highly risky strategy as the mood among Palestinians appears to be hardening against any hint of concessions to Israel whose forces have been responsible for the vast majority of the fatalities. </p> <p>UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has been in the region for a week brokering an end to the bloodshed, said that the summit would take place today or tomorrow, and without preconditions. He called on both sides to cease shooting. </p> <p>Arafat's announcement is in sharp contradiction to comments made yesterday to a funeral crowd of several thousand in the Palestinian-controlled town of Hebron where Fatah fighters closely associated with his regime called for new attacks on Israeli settlers and the Israeli armed forces. </p> <p>The comments also suggested that Barak has little chance of seeing his demand met that Arafat re-arrest dozens of Hamas militants released from Palestinian detention in the last week. </p> <p>Yesterday clashes continued between Palestinians and the Israeli Defence Force. In Hebron Palestinian youths stoned Israeli soldiers in the centre of the town, drawing fire from the soldiers.</p>",
  "The Jewish settlers came to the mosque of Houwara al Kabir on the outskirts of the West Bank town of Nablus in the early hours. In the deserted midnight streets the sound of the Mitsubishi van woke Palestinian residents in their shops and houses. <p>Those who risked looking from their windows noticed two things: the Israeli army patrol vehicle that had spent the day shuttling up and down warning them to stay inside their houses had retreated. Instead, heavily armed Jewish settlers had taken their place, let into the town by the Israeli soldiers. </p> <p>'I could see the settlers get out,' explained shopkeeper Basil Odeh, standing in the blackened shell of the mosque amid the stench of smoke and petrol. 'I was afraid they were coming to shoot into our houses. I shouted out to warn my neighbours. A few minutes later I heard the bomb and looked out to see the flames coming from the window of the mosque. I tried to shout to my neighbours to come and help but it was too late. The mosque was gutted.' </p> <p>Odeh surveyed the wreckage of the mosque and led us to a bookshelf lined with scorched copies of the Koran. 'You ask me whether the peace process can ever work; if we can live with Jews. When it comes to attacking my religion, it makes it very difficult. How can you expect us to live with people who treat us like this?' </p> <p>On Thursday it was the mosque. Last Saturday it was Joseph's tomb - a Jewish shrine wrecked by the Palestinian boys of the shabab. They found and killed a rabbi, Hillel Lieberman, who rushed from the nearby settlement of Eilan Moreh to rescue religious artefacts. They tortured and shot him, then dumped his body. </p> <p>On Wednesday they buried Lieberman, and by the time the settlers burnt the mosque, two young Palestinian men were also dead: Mahar Ismail, aged 20, and Natheer Naif, 22, from the village of Jammain. </p> <p>So it goes: the terrifying and disproportionate cycle of violence between Arab and Jew in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. After a fortnight of clashes that have seen more than 100 die - the majority stone-throwing Palestinian youths cut down by Israeli soldiers - a calculus of Old Testament vengeance is being drawn up by the extremists of both sides. A mosque for a shrine is what it demands. A life for a life. </p> <p>The tensions laid bare in Nablus and its outlying communities - both Jewish settler and Palestinian - reveal in microcosm the fracture lines that are threatening to rip apart the peace process and plunge the region into war. </p> <p>For the events of the past two weeks beg Basil Odeh's bleak but simple question: can, after all the years of promised peace talks, of wrangling and negotiation, the people of the West Bank and Gaza and their cousins, the Israeli Arabs, ever co-exist with the Jews of Israel? </p> <p>Seven years after the Oslo Peace Accord - and two years after the agreement at Wye Valley that saw the PLO remove the promise from its covenant to destroy the State of Israel - the prospect of peace looks more distant now than ever. And in Nablus the communities are on the verge of guerrilla war. </p> <p>An hour after visiting the mosque of Houwara al Kabir we trudged through the dust of Jammain village a few kilometres away as the corpses of Mahar Ismail and Natheer Naif were carried amid a crowd of several thousand to the cemetery. </p> <p>'Mahar was bending down to pick up olives,' says one of his friends pointing towards the groves where Mahar died. 'Perhaps the Israelis thought he was picking up a stone.' </p> <p>Or perhaps the soldiers who killed them believed the men were among Palestinians who that afternoon had fired on the funeral procession of Rabbi Hillel Lieber man from among these trees. </p> <p>What is beyond dispute is that in the past few days both sides have been organising into their own militias. In a dangerous development that is being repeated across the Palestinian Territories, a chilling new expression is coming into currency inspired by the experience of Israel's northern neighbour in its long civil war. 'Lebanonisation' is the slow, vicious fracturing of society into militias under the pressure of sectarian violence. </p> <p>'You know, I think the Palestinians in general are not killers,' my companion says as we walk beside the corpses being carried shoulder high among the chanting of Hizbollah slogans. He is a middle-class professional Palestinian who speaks good English, declining to give his name. 'But we are fighting for our lives. It is clear that the Israelis are not prepared to give us anything. They want to treat all Arabs as slaves and second-class citizens. And under attack we have the right to defend ourselves. We have to have militias. We have to gather arms where we can find them.' </p> <p>The promise of a comprehensive Middle East peace was contracting last week into two closed worlds, implacable in their hostility to one another. The efforts of the international community, and of the Palestinian and Israeli leaders, to bring the peace process back on track will come to nothing if they cannot carry their increasingly distrustful communities. </p> <p>Now it is the very polarisation of the two communities that appears to be driving the political process itself. On the Israeli side, Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been forced to accommodate his right-wing Likud opponent Ariel Sharon, whose visit to the Haram al Sharif mosque two weeks ago triggered the killing, by offering a place in a 'unity' administration. Pressure on Yasser Arafat has seen him free Hamas militants from detention. </p> <p>On Thursday the latest multiplier in the escalating crisis was the 'lynching' of two young Israeli reservists in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Arrested as they lost their way, they were murdered by a mob who entered a police station and - unhindered by policemen of the Palestinian authority - stabbed, shot, kicked and burnt to death. </p> <p>Israel's response - firing missiles into the town centre - was swift and out of proportion. </p> <p>The two closing worlds are crucially different in important aspects. The world of the settlers and their right-wing Jewish allies is self-interested, exclusive and driven by a religious and ideological extremism that refuses to accept that Palestinians and Israeli Arabs have any right to their own land, regardless of the commitments that Israel has signed. </p> <p>On the side of the young Palestinian and Israeli Arab rock throwers of the shabab - and the gunmen emerging to support them - the alienation is driven by the harsh reality of day-to-day existence and half a century of discrimination in their own land. </p> <p>Critical in undermining the peace process on the Palestinian side has been its failure to improve the lives of ordinary Palestinians. Since Oslo, as the Palestinian commentator Edward Said points out in his new collection of essays on the peace process, unemployment among Palestinians has risen dramatically. Gross domestic product has been halved and movement from one side of Palestine to the other (guaranteed under the Wye Valley agreement) is as difficult as ever. </p> <p>It is not all the Israelis' fault. The corruption and incompetence of the Arafat regime in the Palestinian-administered areas, as Said points out, has exacerbated the hardship of Palestinians. </p> <p>But for all the failings of the Arafat administration, the central responsibilty for the Palestinians' problems rests with Israel's failure to abide by the Oslo and Wye agreements over free movement of people within the Palestinian Territories, and its failure to curb settlement building that continues to deepen already appalling social and economic problems. These disappointments at the lack of the fruits of peace were the backdrop to attempts to settle the final status for a putative Palestinian State. It was the stalled issue of the future of Arab east Jerusalem as capital of that state that sparked the latest wave of violence and which remains non-negotiable for Barak. </p> <p>For, if the peace process is failing, it is failing on the central assumption of its US and European backers: that as the peace process raised the quality of Palestinian life, the hardest issues of final status would become more manageable. In seven years, it is the reverse that has become the case. </p> <p>These are the complaints rehearsed by the men gathered at Nablus's burned mosque. </p> <p>'Do I believe the peace negotiations have a future?' asks Tael Farraj. 'The answer is no. The Israelis do not want to give us anything. We are getting nothing from the peace process. We know now that there is only one answer and that is an independent Palestinian State with its capital in Jerusalem.' </p> <p>Nor is this sense of disappointment with the peace process unique to the Palestinian Territories. If anything has shocked ordinary Israelis in the past two weeks, it has been the common cause made by so many of their Israeli Arab neighbours with the Palestinian rioters. </p> <p>'The fact is,' says Nabila Espanioly, human rights director of the Al Tafula centre in Nazareth, 'that the situation of Arabs in Israel is that we are second-class citizens in every respect - in education, housing, health and infrastructure. Those Palestinians among us who were made Israeli citizens in 1966 by virtue of where we lived, are discriminated against in every aspect. </p> <p>What is most shocking is revealed in the social-economic scales for all villages and towns which are graded from one to 10 on quality of life. </p> <p>'All Arab villages - save one - are below the fourth scale. The first scale is exclusively Arab. There is not a single Jewish village.' </p> <p>In the current climate of fear Espanioly's work on Palestinian and Arab Israeli human rights has marked her out for right-wing Jews as worthy of anonymous death threats. 'It is so depressing. I have spent my whole life working with Jewish peace campaigners to try and build something between us.' </p> <p>And it is a sign of the tensions between the two communities that even a woman like Espanioly, who has spent years working for peace, cannot unequivocally condemn the mob that murdered the two soldiers in Ramallah. 'It was very bad. Very bad. And I condemn their killing. But Israeli soldiers have killed over 100 Palestinians. That is why a group of people lost control.' </p> <p>She paused. 'I'm going to cry now... you build and build and build and then... this takes us back years.' </p> <p>At Eilan Moreh, the settlement home of the murdered Rabbi Lieberman near Nablus, the troubles of the Palestinians, whose land they have taken, is the last thing on the Jewish settlers' minds. 'I don't care what happens to the Palestinians,' says Sara Gelbard, a 36-year-old religious Jew from London who moved to Israel at 18. </p> <p>'It is not my problem. I don't think there is a peace process. It has been blown up by the Arabs. The diplomatic efforts to save it are just upsetting people here. It is going to happen: we are moving towards war. We are ready. We are prepared to be shut up in our homes for the few days until it is over. God will give us a miracle again, like 1967.' </p> <p>Gelbard's voice is moderate within the settler communities. 'They are cowards all of them. The Arabs, even our own soldiers,' says Rosalie Lasher, an ageing American Jew. 'I was a volunteer in 1967 but I have never known a problem like we have now. I have never known the Israeli Arabs want to fight. It is because we have given them more and more. But we have our own groups. Radical groups. Our young people will protect us.'</p> <p>\u0095 <b>Chronology</b></p> <p><b>28 September: Sharon sets off an explosion</b><br> </p> <p>A visit by Israeli right-wing opposition leader Ariel Sharon to Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque compound, Islam's third holiest shrine, sparks the spiral of violence. </p> <p><b> 30 September: Death that shocked the world</b><br> </p> <p>A terrified Mohammed al-Durrah, aged 12, shelters beneath his father's arm from crossfire in Netzarim Junction.

  "The government has caved in to demands from big business and scrapped plans to give mothers the right to return to work part-time after maternity leave, The Observer can reveal. <p>In a blow to Labour's attempts to woo women voters, Stephen Byers, Trade Secretary, will next month rule out the proposal when he unveils a new green paper on 'family friendly' policies. </p> <p>Baroness Jay, the Women's Minister, had pressed hard for the right to be included in Labour's next election manifesto. Campaigners for women and the family last night condemned the move as a capitulation to heavy lobbying from business organisations. </p> <p>Labour women MPs will also be concerned that male members of the Cabinet have again overruled the advice of both Jay and her deputy, Tessa Jowell, on a key family policy. </p> <p>However, sources close to Byers yesterday defended the move. 'We need to be sure there is not a backlash against women, so employers don't stop hiring them,' an official said. </p> <p>Recent nationwide research by the Equal Opportunities Commission found that almost 50 per cent of women with children who asked their bosses to reduce their hours or work from home were turned down. One in five of those who refused was then sacked or forced to resign. </p> <p>An EOC spokeswoman said yesterday: 'We would be very disappointed if this does not go ahead.' </p> <p>Almost half of the British workforce is now female. Of about 7 million people in part-time employment, almost 6 million are women, mainly with small children. It is expected that 70 per cent of mothers with children under five will stay in work by 2010. </p> <p>The family review is expected to back a period of paid paternity leave for fathers around the time of the birth, extended maternity leave for women and a substantial increase in maternity pay. Currently men and women are entitled to three months' unpaid parental leave to be taken at any point during the first five years of a child's life. But it remains unlikely, the source confirmed, that the Government will fund all three months. </p> <p>Unions are likely to consider a challenge to existing legislation under the new Human Rights Act. </p> <p>'You can argue that family-friendly policy and long working hours do not equate - and this may be against the right to family life,' said Carolyn Jones of the Institute of Employment Rights. </p> <p>Ministers are also likely to agree to CBI demands for earlier notice - up to a month - from women on maternity leave as to whether they intend to return to their jobs. </p> <p>Jay and Jowell have already been embarrassed twice this year. They helped arrange Tony Blair's humiliating appearance before a Women's Institute conference and they backed a summit on female body image which produced a string of critical headlines.</p>",
  "Senior Labour figures will be presented with a two-horse race when they meet next weekend to decide Donald Dewar's successor, The Observer has learned. <p>Party sources revealed that Jack McConnell, the finance minister, intends to stand for the leadership, resisting pressure for him to allow enterprise minister Henry McLeish to be elected unopposed. </p> <p>McConnell, 40, has refused to reveal whether he will stand because he feels that the focus should be on mourning Dewar's death from a brain haemorrhage on Wednesday, which left Scotland deeply shocked. </p> <p>But The Observer understands that McConnell will announce on Thursday or Friday that he will run against McLeish. Dewar will be buried in a private ceremony on Wednesday after a public service at Glasgow Cathedral. </p> <p>'Jack is not going to say anything until after Donald's funeral, but he is going to stand,' one insider said last night. 'There are no circumstances which would stop him from contesting this election.' With speculation about the late first minister's successor threatening to spin out of control, the Labour leadership in Scotland revealed yesterday that an interim leader will be elected by secret ballot at an executive meeting in Stirling on Saturday. </p> <p>Under party rules, the leader is selected by an electoral college of MSPs, trade unions and individual members. But the 28-day deadline written into the Scotland Act by Dewar for selecting a new first minister has forced the party to speed up the process. </p> <p>Lesley Quinn, the party's Scottish general secretary, promised yesterday that the full electoral college would be used later to elect the leader, although the hope must be that the interim leader would go forward unopposed. </p> <p>The post of deputy leader, never filled by Dewar because he did not want to anoint a successor, will also be elected by the full electoral college. </p> <p>The decision to adopt the truncated procedures indicates that Labour is desperate to avoid allegations of a backroom stitch-up in the selection of Dewar's successor. </p> <p>To the fury of senior Labour figures at Holyrood, it was suggested - with prompting from London - that McLeish be handed the job of leader to avoid the need for a time-consuming and divisive succession battle. </p> <p>McConnell will be taking a major gamble if he stands. The former Scottish general secretary has come under intense pressure to back off and give McLeish a free run and, by standing, he risks creating deep divisions within the party. The price of failure would therefore be high. </p> <p>But his supporters believe that he will have a far stronger chance of success under the new process - the electorate will be made up of 54 MSPs and 27 members of the Scottish executive - than the full electoral college. </p> <p>They hope to capitalise on the resentment among MSPs at the McLeish camp's bid to 'bounce' their man into the job, and a backlash against perceived Downing Street interference amid reports that Gordon Brown endorsed McLeish's campaign. </p> <p>The enterprise minister, serving as Labour's senior spokesman in the cabinet until a new leader is elected, is also likely to suffer from accusations that his supporters did not allow a dignified mourning period before they pushed for his election. </p> <p>'The way the numbers break down, it is wide open,' the insider said. 'But Jack wouldn't be standing if he didn't think he had a serious chance.' </p> <p>Details of the election were released as the Prime Minister's spokesman denied that Blair was taking sides. </p> <p>'What he wants is people to pay due respect to somebody who was a close personal friend of his and who is also somebody for whom the people of Scotland have massive affection,' Alastair Campbell said. 'The Prime Minister is not a member of the Scottish Labour Party, and the Scottish party will address this in due course.' </p> <p>Asked if the prime minister was wary of interfering after the backlash over the Welsh leadership battle, Campbell said: 'He is leaving it to the Scots, but I do emphasise that even a few years ago if somebody like Donald had died there would be a little bit of breathing space before normal politics resumed. There's not even been a funeral yet. I think people should wait.' </p> <p>Invitations to the rest of the Cabinet to attend the funeral were still being decided, he added. 'The family feel that Donald would not have wanted a massive thing but our sense is that the country would like a really big send off.' Labour is also considering a permanent memorial to the late first minister.</p>",
  "Tony Blair was accused of 'political cowardice' last night after he refused to back growing calls for cannabis to be decriminalised. <p>Paul Flynn, the Labour backbencher and campaigner for the legalisation of cannabis, said that the Prime Minister should end the 'tragic farce' of present cannabis legislation. </p> <p>He was speaking after the Prime Minister, pressed on Radio 4's Today programme, declared: 'There is a debate about whether you decriminalise cannabis or legalise it, and I am against it.' </p> <p>He ruled out establishing a Royal Commission to examine the issue. 'There is a policy that I happened to believe in,' he said. 'I'm not sticking to it doggedly, obstinately for the sake of it. I don't think it is a very sensible thing to send out a signal that you now want to legalise drugs.' </p> <p>The comments were made in the face of increasing evidence that cannabis use is widespread. On Friday Yvette Cooper, a health Minister, admitted she had tried cannabis at university. </p> <p>Yesterday it was also reported that the Chief Constable of Cumbria Police, Colin Price, said he would turn a blind eye if he saw anyone taking the drug at a party: 'I wouldn't say anything and I wouldn't do anything at all.' </p> <p>Price predicted that legalisation of cannabis was becoming virtually inevitable, and that police time was being wasted in dealing with soft drugs. </p> <p>Flynn said that the everyday nature of taking the drug revealed how ridiculous it was for it to be an offence. 'One Chief Constable says he would not arrest someone for using cannabis recreationally, while desperately sick people are being dragged through the courts for using cannabis medically,' Flynn said. </p> <p>'The debate about decriminalisation erupted after Ann Widdecombe, the Shadow Home Secretary, called for spot fines of \u00a3100 for anyone caught smoking cannabis as part of a zero policy on drugs. </p> <p>Seven members of her party later admitted smoking cannabis, throwing the policy into chaos.</p>",
  "Northern Ireland's power-sharing government faces a new crisis after the family of a murdered republican dissident last night claimed the Provisional IRA killed him. <p>The allegation calls into question the Provisionals' ceasefire and puts further pressure on First Minister David Trimble to resign from the Executive with Sinn Fein. </p> <p>The shooting of Real IRA man Joe O'Connor, 26, in West Belfast last Friday could also spark a bloody feud between mainstream republicans and dissidents. </p> <p>The father of three was shot seven times in the head outside his mother's home in Whitecliff Parade, only yards from where his grandfather, Francisco Notarantonio, was killed by loyalists 13 years ago this week. </p> <p>His mother, Margaret O'Connor told The Observer of the minutes leading up to the killing. Two masked gunmen, backed by look-outs with two-way radios at either end to her son's car as he pulled up to visit her. </p> <p>'One of them put his foot against the door to prevent him getting out. He then fired into the car at Joe. They also tried to shoot my brother, Anthony, who was in the car with my son, but he got away. They fired seven shots into Joe, five in his head and two in his face. </p> <p>'I know it was the Provisional IRA because up to 20 people said they saw who it was as they took their masks off before getting away. They killed Joe because he would not toe their line and opposed them going into Stormont.' </p> <p>The murdered man's sister, Margaret Lennon, claimed the Provos had tried to shoot O'Connor in a bar on the Poleglass estate in West Belfast the previous week. But when the IRA gang arrived, the dissident had just left. </p> <p>Mrs Lennon said that last March one of her brothers had been abducted and questioned by the IRA over his support for republican dissident groups. The kidnappers hijacked a bus belonging to the Catholic Church to transport her brother to a 'safe house' in the nearby Beechmount area, where he was stripped naked, beaten and questioned about dissident republican activity, she said. </p> <p>Her brother would have keen killed then, but for Real IRA gunmen, who went to IRA supporters' homes in Ballymurphy to demandhis release. </p> <p>She added: 'I heard the shots that killed my brother. At first I thought they were fireworks. Joe was killed because he was a true republican and did not agree with the Provos going into Stormont. He died because he spoke out. If this is the new police force on offer, then God help us.' </p> <p>Mrs O'Connor said her entire family had voted for Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams for almost two decades. Her brother, Victor Notarantonio, added: 'We were always for Adams, but never again.' </p> <p>He criticised claims in some national newspapers that the other dissident group, the Continuity IRA, carried out the murder. 'Everybody in this area knows that is a lie,' he said, 'They [the Provisionals] thought they could get away with this killing. They thought it would be no claim, no blame, that people would think it was the loyalists. But now the people know that the Provisional IRA did this to a fellow republican.' </p> <p>Victor Notarantonio's father was killed in disputed circumstances in 1987 when Ulster Defence Association gunmen entered his home and shot him dead as he slept. </p> <p>Last month the Government attempted to gag newspapers allegations that Francisco Notarantonio was set up by British agents to save a top IRA informer. It is alleged that UDA mole Brian Nelson - an agent for the Army's Force Research Unit - had unwittingly found information about a spy inside the IRA, codenamed Steak Knife. Nelson told his handlers that the UDA intended to assassinate 'Steak Knife'. The FRU panicked and saved their IRA mole by making Notarantonio a 'substitute target'. </p> <p>Ballymurphy is a stronghold for mainstream republicans. But there is a sign of dissent just yards from where O'Connor died. Along a wall at the top of Whitecliff Parade is a defiant message: 'The Real IRA fights on.'</p>",
  "Next Saturday, 81 senior members of the Scottish Labour Party will convene at Viewforth, the baronial-style headquarters of Stirling council. There, in the shadow of Stirling Castle, the 53 MSPs and 27 members of the party's Scottish executive will deal with one item of business: the election of Donald Dewar's successor as party leader and First Minister of Scotland. <p>It is a near certainty that two candidates - Henry McLeish, the Enterprise Minister, and Jack McConnell, the Finance Minister - will be nominated from the floor. But whichever man emerges from that room as the victor, one outcome is guaranteed. The tragic events of last week mean the United Kingdom is about to experience the most profound shift in its constitutional settlement since the Scots voted to establish the Holyrood Parliament in 1997. </p> <p>'Donald's death is going to have a huge impact on the relationship between Edinburgh and London,' said one senior Labour MP at Westminster. 'You would have to be an idiot not to believe it is now a very different game.' </p> <p>At 12.18pm last Wednesday, the moment Dewar was pronounced dead, the whole of the UK, not only Scotland, entered uncharted and perilous constitutional waters. While Dewar was at the helm, the transition to devolved government had been relatively smooth and unthreatening. With his Westminster pedigree and Cabinet big-hitter status, he formed the crucial bridge between the old, unitary UK and the new, devolved system. </p> <p>In Scotland, he was respected as the driving force behind change; in Downing Street, he was trusted as the safe pair of hands to keep that change firmly anchored in the wider Labour vision of Britain. Open conflict between Holyrood and Westminster has been almost non-existent. But with Dewar's passing, the realities of dividing power between two different parliaments will quickly become apparent. </p> <p>For whoever takes over from Dewar will immediately be confronted with the unenviable task of moving the Parliament out from beneath the late First Minister's shadow. To do so, they will almost certainly have to adopt a more nationalistic agenda. </p> <p>According to recent polls, fewer than one in four Scots want independence, while more than half support devolution. But at the same time, the SNP has established a fairly solid lead over Labour when it comes to Holyrood voting intentions. The implication is clear: voters might not want to break up the UK but they want a Scottish Executive ready to rough it up with Downing Street. </p> <p>'The idea that the British state has ever been homogeneous is flawed, but never more so than now,' said James Mitchell, professor of politics at Strathclyde University. 'The real test of devolution was always going to come post-Dewar, and we are now moving into a much more realistic phase for the Scottish Parliament. </p> <p>'Without Dewar, it is going to have to stand up, establish itself and work.' </p> <p>So McLeish or McConnell will have to be prepared to break away from the path dictated by London party policy, a task that may come more naturally to McConnell. He was a founder of the Scottish Labour Action group in the 1980s and represented Labour on the Constitutional Convention. McLeish, by contrast, was a Westminster MP for 13 years, during which time he served as a UK Minister. But even he will want to start thumping a more overtly Scottish tub if he wins. One minefield the new First Minister will almost certainly have to cross involves the question of greater powers for Holyrood, in particular over raising its own finances. </p> <p>More importantly, Dewar's successor will have to be seen to secure a few victories against London. And that may create further problems for Labour in Scotland. There are fears in some quarters that neither man has the stature to take on Downing Street over a major issue of policy and win. 'The relationship between London and Edinburgh is going to be much more fluid,' said Mitchell. 'Dewar was somebody who could go to Blair, if not as an equal, then damn near it, and the loss of somebody who was such a big player on the British field is going to have a serious effect. Dewar was able to smooth things over, and none of the potential candidates is going to be able to do that.' </p> <p>Some leading Labour MSPs agree. One told The Observer : 'Downing Street will be concerned because Tony Blair knew Donald well and so did Gordon Brown. Whatever relationship they have with whoever takes over will not be the same.' </p> <p>All this will make life difficult for Downing Street. The movement of power away from London fits in with Blair's philosophical support for decentralisation. But it runs counter to his centralising instincts that the 'only way to get things done' is for him and his staff to get involved. He has had to learn, from the debacle of Ken Livingstone's successful campaign to be Mayor of London to the mess over Alun Michael in Wales, that devolving power means losing power. </p> <p>In an interview with The Observer in the spring, he admitted that he had to learn to let go. </p> <p>That decision will be tested now. Much like Margaret Thatcher, Blair has never really 'got' Scotland. He left it to the likes of Dewar, one of the few people he felt politically in awe of. Now he no longer has that luxury. 'The best way to describe it is that devolution is a big juggernaut Blair could live with so long as Donald was driving,' said a senior Scottish Labour MP. 'He knew its path would be predictable and it would only really have one gear. But now the fear is the juggernaut will run out of control.' </p> <p>A senior Labour Party figure with close connections to Downing Street said Blair was 'totally relaxed' about leaving the decision to Scotland. Downing Street has poured cold water on claims it intended to parachute in a senior Cabinet figure - names mooted included that of Alistair Darling, the Social Security Secretary, and John Reid, the Scottish Secretary - to take Dewar's old job. </p> <p>The fact is the potential Scottish front-runners do not fill Blair with the dread with which he greeted the news of Livingstone running for London and Rhodri Morgan running for Wales. A Downing Street source said a decision had been taken that Scotland and Wales should be left to their own devices. </p> <p>Many in Scotland are not convinced by these protestations. 'Tony Blair's problem is he doesn't have much understanding of the rest of the UK, which is surprising given that he spent time at school in Edinburgh,' said Mitchell. 'He has devolved institutions, but he still has a unitary state mindset.' </p> <p>Even taking a back seat may turn out to be a dangerous strategy. Blair, if his majority is cut drastically at the next election, will still be relying on Westminster MPs from north of the border to keep him in power. If Labour at Holyrood suffers a meltdown, there would be a knock-on effect on the UK-wide elections. </p> <p>That is why Blair will ensure Gordon Brown has a key role. The Chancellor, who enjoys enormous influence in Scotland, will step in to ensure the handover is smooth. 'Nobody with an English accent in Downing Street will get involved in this, but Brown will still be pulling strings,' said a Scottish MP. </p> <p>The potential pitfalls of this tactic were already emerging within 36 hours of Dewar's death. Supporters of McLeish were spinning that Brown had endorsed their man's bid to be anointed as party leader without a contest in the interests of party unity. The reaction from other Labour politicians and the Scottish media was predictable outrage. Yet again, Downing Street was implicated in a botched attempt to stitch up the contest. </p> <p>But the implications of Dewar's death are not limited to the Executive benches. Three weeks ago, the SNP's own big-hitting frontman, Alex Salmond, stepped aside after 10 years at the helm. </p> <p>The SNP, too, is adjusting to having a new, relatively inexperienced and untested leader in John Swinney. 'We used to have two real heavyweights slugging it out,' one MSP said last week. 'Now it is going to be two featherweights.' </p> <p>And if the new First Minister does pull off a few victories against London, the nationalists may well see their opinion poll leads evaporate. 'It is just too early to say what sort of effect this will have on the Parliament and on our strategy,' said Swinney, who was able to take on Dewar at question time only once since being installed as leader. </p> <p>'Obviously, I had not expected to be facing a new Labour leader this quickly, although I thought there was a possibility there would be a new one by the time of the Scottish general election in 2004. The one thing I would say is that political culture is shaped by people and the way people interrelate within institutions.' In the next few months, Scotland and the rest of the UK will find out how deep that change will run.</p>",
  "At the height of the fuel crisis, Margaret Beckett denounced that part of conservative Britain which tolerated elections only when they brought victories to the Right. 'There is a group of people in this country who passionately believe... that there is something terribly, terribly wrong about having a Labour government,' she said. 'Labour ought never to be in power and if we are we ought to fail.' She was ridiculed as a barking conspiracy theorist by those who forgot the plots of MI5, retired colonels and Napoleonic tycoons against the Wilson administrations, but not by those who have been keeping an eye on the Countryside Alliance. <p>The Alliance's fight to save hunting is no longer being waged with vaguely rational arguments. Enter its collective mind and you are in a war of national liberation against an alien and depraved dictatorship. If you think I'm exaggerating, ask how Sam Butler, the Alliance's chairman, could bellow without a blush to a demonstration outside the Labour Party Conference: 'Our forefathers didn't fight Hitler to have this lot take away our liberties.' One of Butler's forefathers was 'Rab' Butler. He didn't fight Hitler, he appeased him throughout the Thirties and then aided Lord Halifax's manoeuvres to force Churchill to come to terms with the Nazi in 1940. His grandson cannot spot the difference between a Government which is reluctantly allowing a free vote on hunting in response to overwhelming public and backbench pressure, and a totalitarian invader. </p> <p>Because Parliament will sooner or later ban hunting with dogs, the MPs who support the new Hitler must be presented as human filth; unnatural and unEnglish politicians who have forfeited the right to legislate. </p> <p>The magazine Earth Dog, Running Dog, for example, which carries the Countryside Alliance's logo, said of Ben Bradshaw, the gay Labour MP for Exeter: 'Fortunately most people are still totally revolted by such lifestyles. Let us not forget the money the health service is forced to spend on the treatment of Aids - the gay plague.<i>Do we really deserve to have such people rule us and tell us what to do ?'</i> Bradshaw's black colleague, Oona King, meanwhile was 'typical of her species'. She was told to 'direct her talents to advising her scrounging supporters on how to claim more handouts [the editorialist means the London poor King represents, not farmers]. <i>She has no right to interfere in my life or anybody else's, apart from the deadbeats who helped send her to Parliament.'</i> Butler has told his troops that the Government's record was one of 'terrorists released, rioters allowed to roam the streets wreaking havoc and destruction, whilst the authorities look on'. The Alliance 'has made it clear to Parliament and public alike that we have been resolute in our determination to conduct our protests within the law.<i> However, should Parliament act perversely on the issue of personal freedom, then it will only have itself to blame for what may follow.'</i> (My italics throughout). </p> <p>As you can see, the anti-hunting campaign isn't only about hunting. The Alliance is a porte-manteau stuffed with every rage against women, gays, blacks, the poor, the Good Friday Agreement ... a damnable modern world turned upside down. </p> <p>Butler's prediction that hunters will take the law into their own hands if the deviants in Parliament 'act perversely' is already being realised. The provisional wing of the Countryside Alliance is the Rural Action Group. It affects an air of conspiratorial secrecy, while neglecting to take elementary precautions to protect its emails. The most recent warns of the need to 'keep quiet' about its plans for tractor and Land Rover owners to blockade Parliament Square (on 23 October, traffic wardens should note). </p> <p>If this sounds like an imitation of the tactics of the flying fuel pickets, then the resemblance may be more than coincidental. You do not have to go all the way with Beckett's notion that the oil refinery protests were a plot to be struck by the overlap between the demonstrators, the Countryside Alliance and the Conservative Party. Protesters' cars at the Stanlow oil refinery bore Alliance stickers. Where Tony Blair was confronted with demonstrators in Hull they carried banners crying 'No Hunting, No Petrol'. Liberal commentators responded by dissecting the hypocrisy of supportive Conservative politicians and newspapers who usually demand punitive sanctions against greedy strikers 'holding the country ransom'. But in truth their double-standard charge cut both ways. If Lefties believe urban workers are entitled to take action to protect their livelihoods, how can they criticise farmers suffering in the wors agricultural depression since the Thirties for following suit? </p> <p>Honest critics would be forced to hold their tongues if the Alliance and its fellow travellers represented the countryside. Predictably, they do nothing of the sort. Sam Butler isn't a persecuted yeoman, but a millionaire estate agent who has made his fortune by selling Cotswold property to the commuters and second-home owners who price the local peasantry out of the market. Britain's biggest builders - Robert McAlpine, Sunley Holdings, Persimmon Homes - are among his backers. So too is the Duke of Devonshire who wants to bring open-cast mining to his Derbyshire estate. These are 'countrymen' who are 'for field sports, not fields', as the International Fund for Animal Welfare neatly put it. </p> <p>They are also the Tory party on horseback. The Alliance offices are filled with ex-Conservative officials and MPs who lost their jobs in the 1997 massacre. Conservative councillors joined the refinery picket lines. My guess is that the Government's attempts to strike a deal with fuel blockaders before their deadline runs out in 28 days will be futile. Their Tory wing may find it hard to see the political mileage in compromise. </p> <p>The losers from the hijacking of rural grievance by the estate agents and developers are poor farmers. The best hope for an agricultural industry being crucified by a high pound is early entry to the European monetary union. The Alliance will no more support scrapping the pound than gay marriage or a windfall tax on the oil cartel. </p> <p>Hunters themselves have respectable arguments against the faux humanitarianism of prohibiting hunting with dogs but not with guns. They might ask that if the language of socialism is the language of priorities, what seriously radical Labour Party would waste a moment on fox hunting after 18 years in opposition? They could, and indeed have, concluded that their opponents are more concerned with persecuting hunters than saving foxes. </p> <p>For all that, the reasons to tolerate hunting have been destroyed by the hunting lobby. Any civilised person who has gaped at its bigotry can only shrug and mutter: all persecution is fine by me. </p> <p>\u0095 <b>And the biggest criminal is ... the governor, apparently</b></p> <p>As our politicians are meant to be eager to save us from crime, you might have thought that a prison governor who managed to turn criminals into law-abiding citizens would be f\u00eated. </p> <p>Yet Eoin McLellan-Murray, the governor of Blantyre House, was loathed. He ran a prison with the lowest number of positive drug tests of any jail in Britain. It didn't help him. </p> <p>Just 8 per cent of his inmates reoffended on release. The achievement served only to goad his enemies. In April they organised a raid by 80 officers dressed as if they were a Swat team breaking up a terrorist cell. McLellan-Murray was suspended and his jail was ransacked. </p> <p>His offence was to run a liberal prison which prepared inmates for release by letting them work for Kent employers and charities. </p> <p>Given the jail's success, reasons had to be found for destroying its regime. Martin Narey, the Director General of the Prison Service, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee in May that he had confidential intelligence of villainy in the jail which he couldn't discuss for fear of prejudicing criminal investigations. Kent Police said there were no criminal investigations. </p> <p>His officers had uncovered stolen goods and escape equipment as they tore through the cells, Narey continued. He did not tell MPs that 'stolen' bank cards were the legally held property of working prisoners and the escape equipment was the tools of a prisoner who was repairing a Mencap charity shop. </p> <p>This week the Home Affairs Committee will call Narey back to explain himself. Understandably, he has asked to give his evidence in secret. I hope the MPs will turn him down and ask why they were spun dark tales of criminal conspiracy and contraband which cannot be substantiated. </p> <p>They should also inquire about the fate of the governor. Since the biggest raid in the recent history of the Prison Service failed to find anything McLellan-Murray need be ashamed of, he has been subjected to months of interrogation by Home Office hardliners desperate to find a justification for zero tolerance reduced to absurdity. </p> <p>Last week, they gave us their best shot. Harry Fletcher, the spokesman for the probation officers union, reports McLellan-Murray will face disciplinary charges of failing to account for the purchase of a gas cylinder worth \u00a3110, two electric sockets priced at \u00a38.56 and a \u00a3500 donation to the mentally ill from the prison's charitable funds. </p> <p>He is not being accused of pocketing the money. It is merely that he or one of his subordinates didn't fill out the right forms when they dealt with the paperwork. For these terrible sins, one of the finest public servants in the Home Office will see his career wrecked while Narey's flourishes. 'Scandal' is an overused word by hacks, but in this instance no other will do.</p>",
  "Brian Lace was a well-paid cameraman for Border TV until he was fined \u00a3200, sacked, evicted from his house and had his car repossessed. With a criminal record, he found it impossible to find other work. A year later, living on benefits in a bedsit, he hanged himself from the back of a door. <p>Gary B was sitting at the dinner table with his partner, Jill, and their four children when 12 plain-clothes policemen with truncheons burst into his house and searched it for an hour-and-a-half. He was arrested and imprisoned for six months and has not worked since. The children could see him for only two hours a fortnight; his son became ill with stress. All four children now have a profound hatred of the police. </p> <p>Mark Gibson, a middle manager in a large bakery, was remanded in custody for 11 days before being conditionally discharged. Six years later he was fined \u00a3100. When he and his wife, Lezley, were burgled, losing all their wedding presents, the insurance company refused to pay up on the ground that he had a criminal record. </p> <p>Brian Lace, Gary B and Mark Gibson have one thing in common. They are guilty of the same offence as a third of the Shadow Cabinet, one member of the Cabinet and a Health Minister, at least 20 MPs, the US President (almost), Queen Victoria (quite openly) and six million British people. They used cannabis. </p> <p>Last week Francis Wilkinson, former Chief Constable of Gwent, argued for complete legalisation of cannabis. Yesterday the Chief Constable of Cumbria, Colin Phillips, said he would turn a blind eye if he saw cannabis used at a party. But while the public debate is transformed by a bracing gust of honesty, the war against cannabis is escalating. Almost a third of a million people were stopped and searched for drugs last year. The annual number of people given a criminal record for life for breaking the cannabis laws - among the most draconian in Europe - has risen fourfold in 10 years to 96,381 in 1998. Almost all those offences - 89,129 - were for possessing the drug for personal use. </p> <p>Half of those caught were cautioned. Almost 22,000 were fined. In total, 5,216 went to prison, more than half of them (2,832) just for possession. Fifteen per cent of all prisoners are serving sentences for offences related to drugs - mostly possession of cannabis. </p> <p>Two years ago the number of British people given a criminal record for cannabis use passed one million. The Independent Drug Monitoring Unit (IDMU) estimates that the total cost of upholding the law on cannabis is \u00a31.5 billion a year. Matthew Atha, director of IDMU, said: 'What strikes me is how ordinary a lot of the people are. It's teenagers to pensioners, from long-term unemployed to people in a steady job. We've had doctors, lawyers, teachers, social workers, computer programmers and company directors.' </p> <p>A survey by the Police Foundation found only 0.5 per cent of people think cannabis should be a top priority for police, and 46 per cent think its use should not be illegal at all. </p> <p>An independent inquiry into the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 by the Police Foundation, published in March, concluded that when it came to cannabis: 'The law's implementation damages individuals in terms of criminal records and risks to jobs and relationships to a degree that far outweighs any harm that cannabis may be doing to society. It criminalises large numbers of otherwise law-abiding, mainly young, people to the detriment of their futures'. </p> <p>The British Medical Association has declared cannabis 'very safe', and the respected medical journal, the Lancet, said it was 'less of a threat than alcohol or tobacco'. </p> <p>Most people caught in possession of cannabis are likely to be cautioned. But under current legislation, when anyone - such as the Home Secretary's son, William Straw - accepts a caution they admit guilt and end up with a criminal record for life. The police computer will come up with the offence if they try to get a job in the law, medicine, accountancy, the prison service, teaching or any work involving young or vulnerable people. They are also likely to be banned from ever visiting the US. </p> <p>A multiple sclerosis sufferer in Scotland who used cannabis for medicinal reasons wanted to go to the US for medical treatment. The US revoked her visa after it found out about her 'criminal' past. </p> <p>In Carlisle Crown Court tomorrow, Alan Mason will challenge the cannabis laws as an infringement of human rights. A former television producer from Carlisle in Cumbria, he is being prosecuted for possession, cultivation and intention to supply. He plans to claim immunity under the Human Rights Act, enshrined this month in UK law. </p> <p>The civil rights group Liberty also decided last week to use the Human Rights Act to try to overturn the cannabis laws. The Act states that public bodies - such as the police - can only interfere in private life if they can justify it in terms of public health, morals or in protecting the rights of others. Mary Cuneen, of Liberty, said: 'The possession of small amounts of cannabis should not be a crime.' </p> <p>When Jill, her partner Gary and four children were raided by police, she said it was the most frightening experience of their lives. 'It was a terrifying nightmare. Some of the police looked like thugs and they were carrying truncheons.' Gary spent six months in prison for possession and supply - he had given some to a friend - where he mixed with burglars and rapists. 'I felt gutted. I didn't think I could carry on, but I had to for the children,' said Jill. </p> <p>There are also fears that making criminals of more than a million otherwise law-abiding people brings the law into disrepute. Viscountess Runciman, author of the Police Foundation report that argued for the decriminalisation, told The Observer : 'I think it is undermining police-community relations.' </p> <p>For Peter Miles, a former electrician, the debate about legalisation is too late. He has smoked cannabis to combat depression and been busted three times. In one raid he was caught with one-and-a-half ounces of resin, and was prosecuted for possession and intent to supply, a charge he denies. He spent 11 weeks in jail and 60 days tagged electronically. </p> <p>With his record he finds it impossible to get work. 'Society has basically written me off,' he said. 'As a cannabis user who has never hurt anyone, I am put in the same category as rapists and robbers. It makes me furious.' </p> <p>\u0095 Some names in this article have been changed. </p> <p>\u0095 anthony.browne@observer.co.uk</p>",
  "The Cairo summit announced by President Clinton yesterday is an act of desperation rather than any kind of peace negotiation - part armistice, part ceasefire. It has no specific agenda and proposals for its format hit difficulties almost as soon as the event was agreed in principle. <p>While Palestinians would welcome UN chairmanship of the gathering and object to any US leadership role, Israel is wary of the UN and would rather see the US act as broker. Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat at first wanted to see Israeli soldiers withdrawn from the portals of cities held by the Palestinians, but he was hastily overruled. </p> <p>Whatever the form of the summit, the future of the Middle East peace process, the careers of three statesmen and the flagship of US policy during the Clinton administration were on the line yesterday. </p> <p>The peace mission, along with the legacies of President Clinton, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak were nearly shattered as Israel went to the brink of war on Thursday night, but all three sides have opted to give that process, and themselves, one final chance. </p> <p>A tense Clinton said yesterday he 'expected both parties to do all in their power to cease hostilities and halt the violence'. </p> <p>However, he added: 'We should be under no illusions. The good news is that the parties have agreed to meet and the situation appears to be calmer. But the path ahead is difficult.' </p> <p>Middle East peace has been by far the most important foreign policy flagship of Clinton's eight years in office - almost every official who has worked for him believes that the zenith of the Clinton epoch was the 1993 handshake on the South Lawn between Arafat and the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. </p> <p>Officials at the State Department were under no illusions as to what is at stake as tomorrow's summit opens. 'Americans dead in the Middle East again, and fighting all over the West Bank. How bad can it get for an administration that knocked their heads together and told them to be friends, right outside the White House?' </p> <p>The programme for a summit includes a 'fact-finding' mission, whose centrality is not lost on State Department officials. 'It is a high-risk ingredient, tantamount to a small-scale Truth Commission,' said one senior official, adding that the mission could rebound on either side. </p> <p>US officials are looking at various options for easing tension without offending their Israeli ally. One is to urge giving Palestinians control over more of the West Bank, simply to lower the numbers of checkpoints they are obliged to go through in daily life. </p> <p>Yasser Arafat's role as leader of the Palestinians is similarly on the line in this next phase. So far, he has failed to show the kind of authority or willingness to enforce calm demonstrated by his hero, Nelson Mandela, when black township rioting threatened to detonate the negotiations between his ANC and the apartheid government. </p> <p>As he prepares for the summit, Arafat remains stuck between the rock of his promises to Israel and the hard place of the fact that his supporters may accept the expedient recognition of Israel as a state, but cannot accept the idea that the Jews have a legitimate and historic right to a homeland on the East bank of the Jordan river. </p> <p>Jewish disappointment in him was summed up by one of the five Jews who met him in Stockholm during talks that led to the Oslo accord, Menachem Rosensaft. 'When the Ramallah mob murdered Israeli soldiers in cold blood, the hopes for any real peace any time soon were butchered as well. Not a word from Arafat condemning the carnage.' </p> <p>The summit is in many ways Barak's last chance to resurrect the middle way he sold to the Israeli electorate and then began to implement, with Palestinian co-operation. </p> <p>His proposals to compile a government of national emergency would almost inevitably entail the inclusion of General Ariel Sharon, whose march into the Temple of the Rock site sparked the violence.</p> <p><br><b> The Players:</b></p> <p><b> BILL CLINTON</b><br> <b> US President</b> <br> 'Now we should be under no illusions... the situation is still quite tense' </p> <p> <b> HOSNI MUBARAK</b> <br> <b> Eygptian President</b> <br>Is willing to host a summit as long as it serves the Palestinian interest.

  "On the day Lebanese Hizbollah guerrillas captured three Israeli soldiers in disputed border territory I was sitting talking to a middle-aged, middle-class Palestinian mother, a medical doctor, brought up in this country after Jewish fighters ejected her family from West Jerusalem in 1948 and far more likely to be found lecturing in her cut-glass English at a podium or ministering to the poor at her London surgery than breaking and piling up stones for children to throw at Israeli soldiers, though she would relish the experience. <p>She was beside herself at the news. She hit her palm with her fist; phoned a friend; jumped for joy. Her eyes glowed. Hizbollah's achievement in ejecting the Israeli army from Lebanon after 22 years has struck an ominous and envious chord in all Palestinians. </p> <p>On the day of the lynching of two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah, Palestinians and other Arab friends of mine were not so much horrified as resigned. They were much more concerned by President Clinton's immediate condemnation of the 'murder' while the deaths by Israeli rifle fire of 25 Palestinian children up to that stage had evoked from him no such comment. To them, and to their millions of compatriots, the state of siege the Palestinians found themselves in and the underlying vitriolic hatreds released by the events of the previous weeks more than justified such an horrific act, an understandable reprisal, as one of them put it, by a resistance movement fighting against military occupation. </p> <p>It is not surprising, this outpouring of hate, this bloodstained Schadenfreude, fuelled as it is by 52 years of Palestinian dispossession, 33 years of military occupation and the callous disregard for Arab lives shown by Israel's security forces and politicians and its many friends abroad. The river of bile flows from the continuing and, it seems, infinitely extendible, suppression of Palestinian civil and human rights under the diaphanous covering of the Oslo peace negotiations. </p> <p>The Oslo process, woven in secret in 1993 - a bad start - and the skin-deep improvement since then in relations between some Israelis and some Arabs, has been a misleading and humiliating farce for the Palestinians. Yet it has been one they and their leader played out in mainly peaceful compliance until the beginning of the end of the whole affair at Camp David this summer. Then, the long-delayed but crucial issues of Jerusalem and refugees, Israel-Palestine borders and Jewish settlements, were finally addressed, with formidable pressure on Yasser Arafat to concede the match and yield any further claims against Israel, a pressure he successfully resisted with the reward of Arab accolade and American-Israeli contumely. </p> <p>Now it is the end, the bitter end, manifested in the physical explosion of Arab resentment, frustration and loss of hope inside the Occupied Territories and inside Israel proper - among its one million (second-class) Palestinian citizens - during the past 17 days. </p> <p>The essential flaw in the peace process is not just the vagueness of the original Oslo project, by which the Israelis were able to delay their staged military withdrawals from or redeployments in the Occupied Territories of the West Bank and Gaza to the extent that they are in possession of 60 per cent of the former and 20 per cent of the latter to this day, and still, as we see daily, effectively command and control the rest. </p> <p>It is not just that in the seven years of this process, against the spirit but not the letter, of Oslo, Israel's illegal settler population in the West Bank and Gaza (not counting the Jerusalem settlers) has expanded from 110,000 to 195,000. Since Ehud Barak came to power 15 months ago, nearly 2,000 dwellings have been started in the Israeli settlements, about the same number as for 1998 under the ostensibly more aggressive Binyamin Netanyahu. </p> <p>Nor is it only the closure of Jerusalem to Palestinians not resident there (which means that most Palestinians in the Territories cannot pray at the Holy Islamic and Christian sites of the Old City); nor the ethnic cleansing of Arabs from Jerusalem; nor the daily indignities at the roadblocks and Ministries and criminal courts run by a foreign military power; though all these impositions, which we called apartheid and pass laws in South Africa, continued to intensify Palestinian despair while the diplomats and politicians displayed their maps and talked of peace. </p> <p>It was not alone the shame of seeing the leader, the Old Man, the apotheosis of Palestinian Nationalism, Yasser Arafat, forced into the role of quisling, arresting his own activists, made to bear responsibility for outrages triggered by the aggravation of his people by military occupation. Today, full of flaws, unaccountable, autocratic, quivering, beaten down, the visionary who brought the Palestinians to the brink of statehood, as he thought, seeing his dream explode, he evokes that cry: 'Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.' </p> <p>No. It was more than this that accumulated and broke the dam. The Palestinians found out this summer that Israel wanted yet more concessions: their legal rights to proper, effective self-determination traded for a clean bill of health for Israel. For an ephemeral state, Arafat was to sign up to dropping the whole Palestinian case against Israel. For the administration of a sticking plaster, a deep and angry wound was to be forgotten: the exodus from Palestine; the horrors of massacre and exile; the right of return; all recognised by and enshrined in international law and United Nations resolutions. </p> <p>As for Jerusalem, the Arabs had notionally conceded West Jerusalem to the Jews (a concession made by no major government, neither the United States nor Britain, for instance, since Israel's creation in 1948): now they were being asked to concede East, Arab, Jerusalem as well; though Ehud Barak's smoke and mirrors would have been deployed to make this look palatable, with outer Arab city areas granted a kind of municipal quasi-sovereignty. </p> <p>The Israeli and American spin doctors convinced most of the media that only the Holy Places were at issue, when it was the ancient and continuing right to Jerusalem, the right to the communications, commerce, vitality, heritage, bloodline, stones and bones of that city, to a real capital at Palestine's core, the new state's nerve centre, that Arafat held out for and for which justifiable campaign he was excoriated and blamed by President Bill Clinton. It was ironic that, in the end, it was in the Holy Places where the dam finally broke. </p> <p>Here is the final indignity, clear, undeniable yet unsolvable. The United States is no arbiter in this dispute between a feeble, nascent nation with no muscle and a shiftless, shaky Arab world at its rear; no unbiased broker with the best interests of both parties at heart, holding the ring for a fair outcome. The United States of Bill Clinton, and any foreseeable United States of Al Gore or of George W. Bush, is the friend, mentor, armourer and financier of Israel, advocate, judge and, ultimately, progenitor and saviour of unilateral Israeli rights and executioner of Palestinian aspirations. If anything, the jury, Congress, outdoes the Presidency, having already, by law, sanctified the confiscation by Israel of Palestinian refugee property by decreeing that the American Embassy in Israel should move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, on to what is largely stolen Palestinian land; only presidential veto, and that only just, has prevented this awesome precedent. As Senator Pat Buchanan once said: 'Congress is Israeli-occupied territory.' </p> <p>No nation - none in Europe, especially Britain; none in the Arab world - can gainsay the United States's power or dare point out the futility of its contradictory position; nor can anyone deny American determination to hold Middle East diplomacy close to its chest. </p> <p>Even Kofi Annan is regarded by the Arabs as an American plenipotentiary, called in temporarily to save the game from a disordered passage of play. And when, if another 'peace process' starts, it will be an American call, with American cards, at an American table, with Israel eyeing the pot. </p> <p>For this reason, as far as the eye can see and despair can stretch, the Israelis and Palestinians are doomed to play out their wretched parts: Israel possessed of the hubris of demanding control of and security in the whole Holy Land in the false colours of a mutually beneficial peace treaty; the Palestinians denied any realistic semblance of self-determination or self-respect. One day nemesis will come, in God knows what form and at what date. Judging by the past two weeks it cannot be far away. </p> <p>\u0095 Tim Llewellyn was BBC Middle East Correspondent from 1977-80 and from 1987-92.</p>",
  "If Palestinians were black, Israel would now be a pariah state subject to economic sanctions led by the United States. Its development and settlement of the West Bank would be seen as a system of apartheid, in which the indigenous population was allowed to live in a tiny fraction of its own country, in self-administered 'bantustans', with 'whites' monopolising the supply of water and electricity. And just as the black population was allowed into South Africa's white areas in disgracefully under-resourced townships, so Israel's treatment of Israeli Arabs - flagrantly discriminating against them in housing and education spending - would be recognised as scandalous too. <p>One fall-out from the current violence in the West Bank is that the world is beginning to recognise the extraordinary injustice with which Palestinians are treated by Israel. Israel likes to portray itself as an island of democratic civility whose peace-making efforts have now been destroyed by a Palestinian onslaught directed by Yasser Arafat. Yes, there is dreadful hatred. And yes, Arafat - cynical and corrupt - is no Nelson Mandela. But the responsibility for ending hatred must lie with the stronger partner. With this week's grim scorecard showing nearly 100 Palestinian fatalities and many more wounded against two Israeli soldiers dead, there is no doubting where the balance of power actually lies. </p> <p>An enraged Israeli population, united by fear and despair, will regard such criticism as grossly unfair. They argue that they signed the Oslo accords seven years ago. Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered a partial handover of East Jerusalem and placing the holy sites outside Jewish control at Camp David in July this year in order to to get a peace deal. Within Israel, there was a move to recognise Palestine as an independent state. It was thrown back in their face, and Arafat has been inciting Palestinians to riot, inevitably prompting the Israeli police and army to react. </p> <p>But that is a self-serving account. The Oslo accords built in an overwhelming Israeli territorial advantage in the West Bank, and inevitably turned Arafat into a compromised leader. He is caught between an intransigent negotiating partner and a sullen, suspicious population over whom he has little direct control - a stooge created by Israeli policy and sustained by it. And all the while Israeli settlers extend their settlements in the West Bank. </p> <p>There is and never can be any long-term legitimacy for the Israeli state in the Middle East as long as this process continues - and it is this that threatens Israel's long-term survival. It was not Mr Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa compound on 28 September that triggered the current mayhem; it was Israeli soldiers killing seven Palestinians and wounding 220 others the following day, a calculated act of oppression for which the 'peace-making' Mr Barak must accept responsibility. </p> <p>It is all very well calling for summits and truces, and if they succeed in creating short-term calm then they are welcome. But this is a moment of truth for Israel. It can threaten all-out war and even reoccupy southern Lebanon. However, it is a course that leads nowhere. If it wants genuine and lasting peace, Israel must work to construct a legitimate Palestinian state, draw back its illegal settlements from the West Bank to build confidence around an agreed timetable and, in the interim, exercise restraint in the way it polices. Playing the role of Old Testament hammer of the non-Jewish will offer no permanent solution to the crisis. </p> <p>This is the course of action that the European Union must back, and quickly. The EU must declare independence from apparently craven American support for whatever Israel does, with successive US Presidents fearing the strength of the Jewish vote in swing states like New York and Florida. Maybe even President Clinton in the last month of his presidency could be outspoken about the situation; he has no more to lose. But with the oil price rising ominously and immense support for the Palestinians welling up round the Arab world, the West needs to be seen on the side of right. </p> <p>This does not mean that we have to be starry-eyed about Arafat, or the medieval culture from which he springs. But two wrongs do not make a right, and Israel's indefensible policy of apartheid must be condemned for what it is. Until then, there can be only more distrust, hatred and violence.</p>",
  "We pride ourselves on many things - our tolerance, our humour, our strength in the face of adversity. But pride in our country has not always been as high up the list as it should be. <p>In part, this is because we find it difficult to reach a common agreement over what it means to be British. After all, we encompass more than one nation and an enormous range of races, accents and attitudes. Some Geordies may feel they have more in common with the Scots than with Londoners, while a Devonian may feel no more affinity for Liverpudlians than he does for people from Cardiff. </p> <p>Melding all this into a shared identity was always going to be a challenge. But it was made even more difficult by the way those on the Left turned their backs on the very concept of patriotism and left the field to those on the far Right. </p> <p>Fifty years ago, George Orwell wrote: 'In left-wing circles it is always felt that there is something slightly disgraceful in being an Englishman, and that it is a duty to snigger at every English institution, from horse racing to suet puddings.' Given the Left's tendency to wash their hands of the notion of nationhood it's unsurprising our perception of Britishness became a conservative one. </p> <p>The words we choose are of profound importance. The language we use to describe ourselves and others defines who we see as outsiders and insiders - and, if one side manages to claim a word for their exclusive use, they have won that battle for that idea. To paraphrase Orwell, in 1984, if we deny ourselves the words, we deny ourselves the thought. The Tories know this better than anyone. Their 'patriotic vision' of what it is to be British has always been a narrow, exclusionary one. </p> <p>Even when the Conservatives try to sound inclusive, their motives are doubtful. During the 1983 general election campaign, the Conservatives ran a poster campaign featuring the face of a young black man with the strap-line: 'Labour says he's black. We say he's British.' Their suggestion that one had to make a choice - that one could not be both - was absurd, if telling. The truth is that many Britons feel entirely comfortable defining themselves as Black British, Chinese British or Indian British. </p> <p>Our history and, therefore, our identity has been shaped since our earliest days by immigration. The first people to come here were Germans - the Angles who arrived in the middle of fifth century. And down the centuries others have added to the mix, from the Normans to the Huguenots, to the Irish, Italians, Poles, Jamaicans and Bangladeshis. </p> <p>It is this diversity of backgrounds and experience which has defined us. Far from being a weakness, it is one of our great strengths. </p> <p>So I do not accept the argument that Britain or Britishness is dead. On the contrary, both are now receiving a new lease of life. Enduring British values of fairness, tolerance and decency are at the heart of the Government's reforms to build a more inclusive, stronger society. </p> <p>Three Labour government Race Relations Acts in the 1960s and 1970s helped create a moral as well as a legal regime in which racist actions and words were put beyond the pale. And since 1997 we have been able to build on those foundations through the first new race relations legislation in 25 years, the inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence which is leading to a sea change in attitudes in the police service and new laws to tackle racist violence and harassment. </p> <p>By embracing diversity, we can help build a Britain we can all be proud of - wherever we are from. Far from returning to the past, standing up for Britain means building a stronger society for all.</p>",
  "<p>In August, 29-year-old accountant Jan Temple responded to a Department of Health urgent warning and had her soya oil breast implants removed. She had learnt that they could cause cancer, kill foetuses and harm breastfeeding babies. </p> <p>The complex and unpleasant operation left her without movement in part of her right arm. Because the soya is a natural product it becomes entwined with the breast tissue and the implants have to be 'ripped out', which can take more than five hours. In many cases the soya becomes putrid and the rancid remains have to be treated as a biological hazard. </p> <p>So far, 1,400 women in Britain have faced this horrific ordeal. But the full story of how thousands of women have been emotionally and physically scarred by these implants is only likely to come out in a US court next year when their American manufacturer faces compensation claims. At the same time, the case will shine light on how faulty medical technologies can easily find approval for use in Europe. </p> <p>Lawyer Paul Balen, representing 1,500 women seeking compensation for problems with the implants, has made repeated requests for information to Munich-based TUV, which in 1995 certified the soya implants as safe for sale throughout Europe. So far he has failed to get any response. </p> <p>TUV is one of 60 companies which, under European legislation, can give approval to medical devices, thus permitting the manufacturer to sell the product across Europe. </p> <p>An Observer investigation has revealed that the soya implants were not the only potentially fatal mistake that TUV made. </p> <p>In 1998 it certified a new type of mechanical heart valve made by the US manufacturer St Jude Medical. The artificial valves control blood flow to and from the heart. The St Jude's valve was coated with silver, whose antibiotic qualities the manufacturers hoped would prevent cardiac infection. </p> <p>Yet, little over a year later, St Jude has been forced to withdraw the valve after some users suffered strokes and at least one person in Britain died. More than 30,000 valves were sold worldwide and over 700 were used in the UK. It has emerged that the silver coating made the valve leak blood, thereby increasing the risk of a heart failure. </p> <p>Although details of British victims have not been made public, a US law firm has filed a suit against the company after a woman from Massachusetts, Linda Baez, developed serious heart problems. She had her first St Jude valve implanted in April 1999. Within a few months it began leaking and she had it replaced in November. This, too, leaked and she had to undergo a third open-heart operation. The lawsuit alleges the company was 'negligent in designing, manufacturing and marketing a defective heart valve that was not adequately tested'. It claims that 'the risk of serious bodily damage exceeded the benefits associated with the design'. </p> <p>One month after St Jude withdrew its valve, the company had to issue a warning about its Affinity pacemakers which were found to be defective. Once again these devices were approved for sale in Europe by TUV. </p> <p>In May this year, another US company, Edwards Lifesciences, had to suspend sales of a device known as a vascular graft, used to repair artery damage around the heart, after it was found to fracture. Although the device had not been approved in the US, TUV had certified it for Europe and it had been used to treat more than 100 people. A spokesman for the US company would not say whether any of these were British, claiming this information was 'commercially confidential'. </p> <p>The Observer passed on its information relating to TUV to the Department of Health, which agreed to launch an immediate inquiry through its Medical Devices Agency (MDA), which regulates medical equipment used in Britain. A spokeswoman said: 'We take these allegations very seriously and will look at any evidence The Observer has. We will make sure steps are taken to ensure the public is not being put at any unnecessary risk.' </p> <p>Despite such assurances, many in the medical and legal professions believe the whole system regulating medical devices is flawed and in need of an overhaul. Each year thousands of Britons are injured or killed by faulty medical devices legally used by surgeons in the UK. Deficient heart valves, pacemakers, hip implants and infant incubators have all caused serious injury and there is little the British authorities claim they could have done about it. </p> <p>It is only when reports of fatalities or other serious problems emerge, that a national authority, such as the MDA, can ban a product from its domestic market. </p> <p>Unlike drugs, medical devices do not require extensive clinical tests. Most of the 60 bodies allowed to approve medical devices are commercial organisations that profit from testing equipment. Government authorities are supposed to vet the bodies but some countries are more rigorous than others. </p> <p>Amanda Maxwell, writer with Clinica, a newsletter for makers of medical equipment, said: 'The number of companies testing medical equipment has mushroomed over recent years and none has been stripped of its licence. Questions are being asked as to whether being a testing body is an 'easy ride'. There are also worries that some of these companies simply do not have the medical expertise necessary to test this equipment.' </p> <p>This year the MDA annual report revealed that over the past 12 months the agency received reports of nearly 7,000 'adverse incidents', including 19 fatalities. Doctors and hospitals do not legally have to report problems, and privately senior MDA figures believe the true level of injuries could be as much as four times higher. </p> <p>Paul Balen said: 'I believe the whole licensing and monitoring procedures throughout Europe need to be questioned.' </p> <p>Dr Karsten Evert of TUV said: 'We test more high-risk medical products than anybody else in Europe, about 800 a year, and unfortunately there will always be one or two incidents. </p> <p>'We cannot be 100 per cent safe and secure otherwise there would be no progress in medicine but I assure you our testing team is among the best in the world.' </p> <p>\u0095 antony.barnett@observer.co.uk </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>'Safe' devices that hide danger</strong></p> <p>Ten medical devices, certain brands of which have been found dangerous despite gaining the 'CE' seal of approval for sale in Europe: </p> <p>\u0095 breast implants </p> <p>\u0095 heart valves </p> <p>\u0095 vascular grafts </p> <p>\u0095 pacemakers </p> <p>\u0095 hip implants </p> <p>\u0095 infant incubators </p> <p>\u0095 dialysis machines </p> <p>\u0095 collapsible wheelchairs </p> <p>\u0095 bedside rails </p> <p>\u0095 ear syringes</p>",
  "Three Dublin criminals with close links to the Real IRA are believed by Irish police to have vital evidence that could convict the Omagh bombers. But political pressure from Dublin has prevented police use of the potential supergrasses' evidence. <p>The Observer has learned that the trio, part of a North Dublin gang, were regarded by the Garda (Irish police) as potential vital state witnesses on the Real IRA unit behind the atrocity. The Omagh bomb, which killed 29 men, women and children, was the mass murder in British criminal history. </p> <p>Dublin government advisers were concerned that the use of evidence from criminals working with the Real IRA would alienate mainstream republicans opposed to a 'supergrass' system. The Irish government was also warned that Sinn Fein would oppose extradition of Real IRA suspects, on the word of such informants, to Northern Ireland and RUC custody. </p> <p>John Bruton, the Republic's opposition leader, said yesterday he would raise the allegations of political interference in the Omagh inquiry in the Dail (Irish parliament) later this week. 'The Omagh bombing was the biggest single crime committed in Ireland in the twentieth century,' he said. 'If these claims are true then it will turn into the biggest blot on law enforcement in this country.' </p> <p>Security sources on both sides of the border told The Observer that three men helped gardai foil several bomb plots prior to the Omagh massacre. Senior officers regarded them as potential witnesses for that crime. </p> <p>The Garda wants to use the same methods that led to the conviction of the killers of Dublin journalist Veronica Guerin in 1996. In that inquiry the 'accomplice evidence' or 'supergrasses', were prepared to give evidence against former criminal colleagues in return for protection. A protection scheme was set up by the Irish government in that case, but no such scheme was devised for Omagh. </p> <p>The use of such witnesses helped convict Paul Ward and Brian Meehan, the Dublin criminals who carried out the murder of Guerin. </p> <p>Sources point to the success of the Garda against the Real IRA before Omagh. Several bombs and caches of explosive were intercepted in early 1998. According to security sources, three criminal informants working with the Real IRA were vital to these successes. They had helped steal cars for the terror group, Pajero jeeps and BMWs for planned bomb attacks. The Real IRA, however, identified the source of the leaks and moved operations north of the border in early summer. </p> <p>In both the Republic and Northern Ireland police forces there is 'deep anger' over inability to use these informants against the Real IRA after Omagh. Three months after the atrocity the Irish police probe was wound down. Pat Byrne, head of the Garda Siochana, this year admitted that those behind the bomb would never be convicted. The names of the chief suspects, including two women, are known to both the Gardai and the RUC. </p> <p>Last Monday the BBC's Panorama programme named Colm Murphy, Liam Campbell, Seamus Daly and Oliver Trainor as possible Omagh bomb suspects.</p>",
  "Inside the prison camp at Chernokozovo, they call it the 'elephant'. 'They put a gas mask on your head. Your hands are cuffed behind your back, so there is nothing you can do. And then they close off the breathing tube and you start to choke.' <p>The torture victim, a small, wiry Chechen man, knelt down and made the sound of a man suffocating: 'The \"elephant\" was the worst.' </p> <p>A second victim spoke of a refinement of the 'elephant': 'Once the gas mask was on, they would choke you, so you were gasping to breathe. And they would let go and you would breathe in deeply. And then they would squirt CS gas down the breathing hole. It was so bad just the sight of the gas mask in the room would make people confess to anything.' </p> <p>The 'elephant' is just one instrument of torture used by the Russian occupation forces in Chechnya, revealed today in a joint investigation by The Observer and the BBC's Radio Five Report. </p> <p>Russian security forces have mounted a series of cover-ups to hide evidence of abuses from the Red Cross and the Council of Europe. In the small Chechen village of Katyr Yurt, a torture victim blinded in one eye spoke of the screams he heard each night while inside Chernokozovo. The screams were so bad local people were forced to move away because they found them unbearable. </p> <p>'At night,' he said, 'the things you heard were just terrible. Every night they would take people out of the cells. They screamed. They had their teeth bashed in, their kidneys smashed in. You could hear them being beaten from the cell. So then they would turn the music up loud, so you couldn't hear the screams.' </p> <p>The youngest victim we met was 17. He was living in a refugee city in Ingushetia, next door to Chechnya. We shall call him Peter. He sat in front of us, head bowed, terrified of eye contact: 'They handcuffed your arms behind your back and hooked the cuffs to a chain so you were suspended from the ceiling, with all your weight bearing down on your hands and shoulders. And then they would use you like a punchbag. They called this \"the swallow\". They'd hold you for half a day like that.' </p> <p>But this wasn't the worst torture for the teenager: 'They put me in a cell. There was something chemical in there. They cuffed my hands behind my back and said, \"Go on, swim\". I practically lost my sight when they shoved my head in there. There was also something else, a barrel full of water with a cage on top. You couldn't get out of there.' </p> <p>Peter drew us a map. Painstakingly, Chernokozovo came to life. Barbed wire, steps down to his cell, the punishment tank where he was dunked in the chemical that left him blind for days. </p> <p>The second victim - Richard - corroborated much of Peter's story and added his own account of agony: the 'meat-rack'. 'They crank a pulley to stretch you with chains attached to your legs. While they stretch you, they hit you with rubber truncheons, bottles full of water, targeting the kidneys.' </p> <p>He also underwent 'the swallow' and electric shock torture. Richard said that one day in the summer a Red Cross representative - a French woman called Catherine - came to Chernokozovo. Could he tell the Red Cross about the beatings and torture? 'No, the guards had come round before and told us we would be tortured if we did.' </p> <p>The Red Cross has confirmed that one of their delegates visited Chernokozovo; her name was Catherine and she was Belgian. </p> <p>Our third witness is a man of 20 who has the voice of an 80-year-old. He screamed so much when he was being beaten that his vocal cords snapped. In a pitiful whisper, he too spoke of the usual welcome at Chernokozovo, the beatings, having to crawl into the interrogation room and ask for permission to enter. </p> <p>While he was there a man was beaten to death: 'I don't remember the date, but they took him out of the cell one evening. We heard them shouting \"Crawl, crawl\". They were beating him and we heard him screaming. Then, the next morning, they led four of us into his room. His body was lying there. They'd broken all his ribs. They forced us to carry him out and dressed the body in the Muslim manner. We dressed the body, covered up with sacks, and they took us back to the cells. I don't know what they did with the body.' </p> <p>All of our witnesses were interviewed separately. Although the Chechens, who have lost the war against Vladimir Putin's greater forces, have every reason to blacken the name of the Russian occupiers, the victims independently supplied such detail of torture that their evidence must be conclusive. </p> <p>Another witness, Paul, 22, spent a month in Chernokozovo, where he says rape was commonplace, until his family bought him out for $500 (\u00a3340) - a year's pay. He had been put in the fridge, where they had to stand without moving a muscle. If they twitched, they were beaten. Paul suffered broken ribs, a cracked vertebra and a mock execution: 'They led me to the corridor. One of them cocked his sub-machine gun. They'd taken the first bullet out of the clip. They put the gun to my temple. As one pulled the trigger, the other clubbed me down. The others could see this from their cells. I'm already dead in their eyes. Then they dragged me out.' </p> <p>The torture described is so systematic it cannot be the work of a rogue unit acting on its own. Following allegations of torture at Chernokozovo by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the Council of Europe was allowed to inspect the camp in March. At the same time, torture victims were taken out of Chernokozovo and put on a prison train that ran up and down branch lines. None of the survivors who were held in the basement - where the worst atrocities were carried out - saw anyone from the international agencies below ground. Neither Amnesty nor the Council of Europe mentions the basement at Chernokozovo - indicating the prison authorities kept it hidden. </p> <p>The latest dispersal technique is to dump prisoners in pits - holes in the ground where the bitter cold of winter is a torture in itself. </p> <p>One witness who had been held in a pit last month said: 'It was freezing. At night they would chuck in smoke canisters and let off CS gas. They threw stones down on us. It was the contraktniki - mercenaries - who did it.' </p> <p>His family paid a ransom of $1,300 (\u00a3900) and they let him go. The Russians kicked him out of an armoured personnel carrier in the middle of Grozny with a bag on his head, leaving him for dead. </p> <p>Putin - whose style has been admired by Foreign Secretary Robin Cook as 'open and refreshing' - has denied that torture is used by his forces in Chechnya. </p> <p>Our last witness was eight months pregnant when thrown into a pit. 'They left me there for two or three days. There was no toilet in the pit. They urinated on me. They had stripped me down to my underwear; it was freezing, with snow on the ground.' They beat her repeatedly, she said, because she had helped the fighters in the First Chechen War, which ended in 1995. </p> <p>When the baby was born, she said, its face was bruised black and its skull deformed. </p> <p>John Sweeney reports on Radio Five Report at noon today.</p>",
  "As dawn breaks, Mack Meyer, clutching his lunch box and with a bellyful of coffee from the all-night drive-thru, stomps reluctantly into the Chrysler assembly plant in North Jefferson, on the edge of Detroit. <p>Mack looks the epitome of the downtrodden all-American working man in thrall to the factory whistle. The truth is that he earns $100,000 with overtime, owns two cars and an upstate hunting cabin, and cannot decide whether to vote Democrat - as his union insists he must. </p> <p>He thinks he'll vote for Bush, 'but I feel kinda bad about it. It's not right for a working man to vote Republican'. But he worries about too much gun control and thinks Bush is 'better on family values and a whole lot better on taxes'. </p> <p>Mack is what is known as a 'Reagan Democrat', which means he will vote Republican when he thinks the time is right and believes that 'Ronald Reagan knew how to talk to us; he had an empathy for the working man'. </p> <p>He would have felt very lonely at the headquarters of Local 245 of the United Auto Workers last Wednesday night, in the suburb of Dearborn, the heart of Ford country. Members of the research and engineering branch of the union had gathered here to watch the television debate between Bush and Gore. </p> <p>Sitting next to his father, Brett McDonald is the latest of three generations to have worked in the Detroit car industry since the Thirties. 'I guess you could say our family's built the finest automobiles the world's ever seen,' says Brett's father, Owen, now retired. </p> <p>Brett can't understand why everyone is criticising Gore for the last debate. 'He's good when he's fighting, gets angry - that's the man we need. Now, people are saying he's done better this time; but I don't think he's done so good being Mr Nice Guy. </p> <p>'This election means a lot to us. If Bush wins, that's a disaster for the American workers.' </p> <p>'Take that silver motherfucking spoon out your mouth!' comes an angry shout from behind, not at McDonald but at Bush on screen. </p> <p>As polls in America's deadlocked presidential election seesaw to the point of meaninglessness, the mathematics are simple: the presidency rests in the hands of thin slices of voters in a handful of battleground states. </p> <p>It will be decided by Florida retirees, farmers and suburbanites of Pennsylvania and Missouri, by blue-collar workers in Ohio and by the swing state of Michigan. Both candidates have bombarded that state with advertising and both made a beeline for it as soon as Wednesday's TV debate was over. </p> <p>Gore arrived in Dearborn to prepare for his rally today in Detroit. Bush was shoring up his stronghold in wealthy Grand Rapids on the rural western side of the state before heading for the car factories of Pontiac, to woo the 'Reagan Democrats'. </p> <p>US leaders have owed a great deal to Michigan this century; the state has picked the President in every election bar one and come within 1 per cent of national figures for three of the past four. Demographically, the 'Wolverine State' is a mini-America, with inner cities, suburban sprawl and miles of open farmland. </p> <p>But Michigan's distinguishing feature is that 30 per cent of its 5 million voters live in 'union households'; Michigan's trade unionists are credited with electing Reagan in 1980 and 1984 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. And of those 1.8 million or so trade unionists, 460,000 belong to the United Auto Workers. </p> <p>In this razor-edge election, they could swing Michigan either way, putting the state's 18 electoral college votes - and potentially the presidency - in the hands of the UAW. </p> <p>Motown - capital of the auto trade and the UAW - is a city where past, present and future meet. There is a famous frieze by Mexican artist Diego Rivera in the city art museum, commissioned by the Ford family, expressing the pain and glory of man's relationship with industrial progress and the machine - the history of Detroit and also the story of the US working class. </p> <p>Nowhere in the Western world is there such a landscape of factories and steel mills - spanning hundreds of square miles and spilling across the river into Canada - through which weave a tangle of railroad tracks and freeways, laden with carriers stacked with cars. </p> <p>The industry rode the recession (just), not least because of the resources available to the 'Big Three' - Ford, General Motors and Chrysler - and Americans' stubborn taste for their own cars and trucks. </p> <p>Yet the streets around GM's new downtown headquarters are among America's most decrepit and dangerous. Bricked-up stores, are arraigned like rows of tombstones, bearing names of businesses that have died like 'Sarah's Pretty Nails and Braiding - Human Hair'. </p> <p>The car factories themselves are flanked by others that are no more than shells of red brick and smashed windows. In places, grass grows through the street tarmac of the great city that gave the world the Ford Mustang and 'Mustang Sally'. </p> <p>Neither Gore nor Bush will waste time in the slums that line Michigan Avenue, near the abandoned Detroit Tigers baseball stadium. They know that the registered voting populace there is minimal. This is where people like Calvin Williams work, in the lone remaining fried chicken joint on the West 3000 block. Going to vote? 'No sir'. Registered? 'No sir'. Why not? 'Ha Ha! Want some chicken, or what?' </p> <p>In the UAW's famous local office Russ Leone keeps a copy of Rivera's frieze and walks corridors lined with photos of the hunger marches against the Ford Rouge plant during which five workers were shot dead, of the great strike of 1941, and of Nelson Mandela's recent visit to pay homage to the courage of plant workers past. </p> <p>Now, Leone admits: 'We've put some of our workers into the top 10 per cent wage bracket. They earn more than $100,000 and think they're capitalists and will vote Republican. Stupid suckers.'</p>",
  "<p>The most intriguing question about the internet is whether it will turn out to be a genuinely subversive technology or whether en-trenched power structures - governments, transnational corporations, cultural establishments - will eventually get a grip on it and subvert it to their own ends. </p> <p>Cyber-libertarians have never been in any doubt. Their view was summed up in John Gilmore's dictum that 'the internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it'. Libertarian suspicion of the evil establishments of the 'real' world was tempered by the consoling thought that these institutions were also irredeemably stupid. </p> <p>The collective IQ of the net was always going to be greater than anything the FBI, GCHQ, Microsoft or the legal profession could muster. And whatever the forces of darkness came up with, the net community could easily circumvent, disrupt or subvert. The balance of power between freedom and control had been irrevocably shifted - and so the internet became a uniquely subversive technology. </p> <p>In principle, this argument remains valid. The technology of the net, and the fact that software is pure 'thought-stuff', means that the subversive creativity of the internet community cannot be snuffed out. There will always be 16-year-old hackers capable of inventing ingenious mouse-traps which can be distributed globally within minutes. Short of banning the use of computers, shutting down the global telephone network and shooting all 16-year-olds on sight, there is little any authority structure can do about it. </p> <p>Where the libertarian com munity errs is in thinking that this is all that matters. So long as the internet remained a virtual playground for geeks, Gilmore's mantra did indeed apply. It still does. </p> <p>But once the net became a mass medium, accessed and used by hundreds of millions of 'ordinary' people and firms - for email, entertainment and commerce - the complacent optimism of the libertarian position began to look like a philosophy of denial. </p> <p>The difference is that established power structures are able to exert much more leverage on a mass medium than they could on a geek playground. Most internet users now are 'ordinary' folk, who lack both the talent and the motivation to cock a snook at authority. They access the net through internet service providers, companies run by accountants who carry no torches for liberty or anarchy. </p> <p>And e-commerce companies aspire to the same status: they are after profits, stability, and the protection of their intellectual property. Few of the key players in the mass-internet want trouble with the established order; in a way they want to be part of it. </p> <p>The Napster case illustrates this. The libertarian position is that it doesn't matter what happens to Napster in the courts because the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking genie is out of the bottle. </p> <p>This is true but beside the point, which is that the moment somebody runs away with these subversive technologies they become something different - and are suddenly more vulnerable to legal attack. </p> <p>The thing about Napster, remember, is not so much that it had zillions of users, but that it wanted to become a billion-dollar company on the backs of those users. This is why the recording companies are so interested in it. </p> <p>'File-sharing means we have to think about a fundamental change of the business model,' Sony's chairman and chief executive told the Financial Times recently. </p> <p>The companies want to destroy Napster not because they desire to stamp out its disruptive technology, but because they want to deploy it for their own ends. </p> <p>Who are the real subversives now? </p> <p><br> <a href=\"mailto:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>I've got nothing against forking out a sumo wrestler's weight in yen for three sets of karate lessons twice a week, because God knows we could do with a bit of Oriental-style inner harmony and mental discipline with seaweed fritters around here, but I'd like to know which enlightened master of the ancient practice of timetabling thought it would be such an excellent idea to hold the yellow-belt exams right in the middle of Football Focus, which by amazing good fortune happens to be the exact time my wife has arranged with her diary to unavoidably pop into town to look in some shop windows and eat cakes at the Jolly Teapot.</p> <p>Still, I am nothing if not Zen-like in the face of the day panning out in a less leisure-oriented way than expected, so pausing only to pack a nutritious hydrogenated-oils-and-chocolate-based lunch for the little one, off we go, me settling for the shipping forecast on the car radio while my raucous trio of red belts discuss textbook lunging techniques and the ritual preparation of Japanese poison blowfish as demonstrated on The Simpsons, activities that it seems can only be properly illustrated by ejaculating loudly (think samurai lottery winner) and waving your arms about in the rear-view mirror of a blood relative. </p> <p>Needless to say, the community centre is nowhere to be found until we have driven past it the three times required by the law of not being very observant, but eventually we're in the waiting room with the rest of the under-12s in their traditional white straitjacket and pyjama bottoms taking advantage of being allowed to throw kicks at each other without being clipped round the ear by a responsible adult.</p> <p>At last we file in. I find a seat at the back with the little one while the red belts sit on the floor being drilled by Sensei Tony, who, already bilingual in English and Essex, is no slouch at unexpectedly breaking into Japanese should the need arise. And it does, the first exercise being stretching and grunting, followed by everyone being required to go to the toilet at the same time with particular reference to remembering to bow as they exit backwards en masse through the one rather small doorway. Afterwards they split into groups to be graded. </p> <p>The first four step forward.</p> <p>'Yoi!' barks Sensei Tony.</p> <p>'To-shiba,' they reply in unison, thrusting their fists ahead, piston-like. 'Su-shi!' The little one leaps to his feet. 'STOP SHOUTING,' he bellows. I wrestle him back to his chair. Yes, I could take a hundred years to explain the declamatory idiosyncrasies of Wado Ryu (Way of Peace) combat procedure but it seems quicker just to give him his Milky Way and get him to draw circles, an activity recently voted by readers of Negligent Parent magazine as the ideal mindless task for any occasion involving choreographed noise. </p> <p>Meanwhile the Way of Peace is proceeding with a front punch and head block. 'Mitsu-BISHI!' They await further instructions in the attitude of persons engaged in synchronised defecation.</p> <p>'Ukulele,' says Sensei Tony, which means 'stamp swiftly on one's imaginary opponent's toe'. They stamp, bow and return to their positions. </p> <p>Now, my own little trio steps out, front-kicking and snap-punching and barking, coincidentally using the same tried-and-tested methods as they use to get into the car. 'YOKO-ugggh!' they shout in unison. It's nice to see them agreeing about something, not to mention using hand-eye coordination for something other than emptying the biscuit tin. </p> <p>It seems only hours later that we are collecting certificates of distinction and happily forking out money for new belts in exchange for being allowed to go home. I manage to find the little one out in the waiting room, so we head off, the other three already elbow-strikeback-fisting and lower-body-sweeping their way to the carpark. Ah, how much longer before they can sit on a beach waiting for someone to come along and kick sand in their face?</p> <p>We get home, where my wife is ready to complete the second part of today's programme of multicultural experiences by having us drive all the way out to Ikea to buy some some knives and forks that match and spend the rest of our lives in the queue trying to get back out again. </p> <p>Ah well, 'Smorgasbjorn birchveneerfloorung tecnik,' as the old Swedish proverb has it.</p>",
  "<p>David Boies was not having the best of days. It was an August afternoon, and he was in the lounge of a Los Angeles airport, waiting for American Airlines to sort out a flight that had been oversold. </p> <p>Recognised by his peers as one of the biggest-hitting lawyers in the US, Boies is used to dealing with the foibles of big business. When the US government wanted to take on the corporate behemoth of Microsoft in the anti-trust trial, it hired Boies. And after a few lengthy stints before the judge, he caused the biggest company in the world to consider breaking up. </p> <p>But he could have been forgiven for thinking this airport delay was just another sign that his luck was turning. His current client, Napster, the internet company that invented a piece of software so powerful it threatened to swamp the world with pirated music, was being sued by the Record Industry Association of America (RIAA). </p> <p>The case was not going well. Boies had lost the first court battle, and, with this huge challenge in the balance, he was stuck in a departure lounge. The flight was blighted by one mechanical problem after another, and they were paying people not to board. </p> <p>Once finally on the plane, Boies became aware of a man repeatedly turning to look at him. Eventually, the stranger asked: 'Hey, aren't you the Napster lawyer?' Boies assented, and then his inquisitor stood up and announced: 'Napster's lawyer is on the plane.' A cheer rose among the tired crowd of passengers. For the first time that day, perhaps, Boies knew that, even if not in the legal sense, he was backing the winning side. </p> <p>The court battle between the reactionary RIAA and the copyright-insolent Napster is set to reach its climax within the next couple of weeks. Whichever way the judgment goes, though, Boies's airborne experience is as clear a sign as any that the war is already lost for the RIAA. </p> <p>Three things are clear about Napster. The first is that it lets anyone copy and share MP3 files - files that use special compression techniques to digitise music so that it can be downloaded over the internet - with alarming ease and at virtually no cost. The second is that many of these duplications or 'exchanges' break time-honoured copyright rules, the laws that ensured the artists got their royalties when the record company sold their music. The third is that people love it. More than 35 million people are now fully fledged converts to the church of Napster. And, after years of paying through the nose for CDs, they don't mind breaking the law to visit it. </p> <p>It has divided some of the biggest names in the music world. Anti-Napster band Metallica have criticised their fans for enjoying the service too much. The Corrs are also in the anti-Napster camp. Radiohead, however, were far more sanguine when their latest album, Kid A , popped up on Napster prior to its massively hyped launch. Perhaps Radiohead's stoicism is the best way to deal with Napster. </p> <p>The court case may eventually force Napster to shut down, but it has spawned a host of imitators who are not going to disappear. In fact, the International Federation of Phonographic Industries estimates that there are currently at least 25 million illegal music files on the internet, producing up to 5 million downloads every year. </p> <p>Take Gnutella, for example. Gnutella is basically the internet's answer to Frankenstein's monster. It was developed as an unofficial project by a team of programmers at America Online who released it onto their website in March, only to realise the consequences of what they were doing and shut it down 24 hours later. </p> <p>Too late: the Gnutella code was out in the wild wild web and significantly it was a serious improvement on Napster. Unlike its predecessor, Gnutella doesn't have a central data base. This is crucial. Napster's central catalogue of music directs users to various sites where they can download records of their choice. Gnutella, however, constructs a labyrinth of virtual private networks which means there is no one point of reference - making it almost impossible for the music industry to kill it via legal action. </p> <p>'There's no one body hosting the index, so there's nobody the industry can sue. It's extremely difficult to prevent Gnutella from existing,' said Jay Marathe, head of consulting with technology investment firm Durlacher. </p> <p>Significantly, Napster, too, is using the index argument as a defence. The company no longer pools music on a centralised database, only directions as to where to find different artists located on various servers in cyberspace. Napster's critics, however, argue that this index is clearly designed to enable people to pirate music. </p> <p>The music industry is not the only business sector that is watching the Napster case with great interest. Scour.net and DIVX, two daring deviants to Napster which allow users to download film and video clips, are currently attracting an enormous following. </p> <p>The music industry now tacitly accepts that, if Boies has to retire a beaten man, another Napster variant is likely to spring up and take over the mantle. In a sign of weary recognition, Paul Russell, head of Sony Music Europe, conceded that it would be possible to accept the likes of Napster - if it used its online advertising revenues to pay and promote artists. </p> <p>'If they came along and said, \"We are smarter than you. We are going to sign up artists and we are going to invest in their careers and we are going to put their music up and invest in their careers\" I could live with that,' Russell said earlier this year. </p> <p>But the real challenge for the record labels is to create a viable online alternative to the likes of Napster which, while never being able to kill online piracy, will prevent it from dominating the industry. </p> <p>The future is not totally gloomy. After all, the record able audio cassette didn't kill the LP or the CD. For similar reasons the online pirates might not end up ruining the music industry. </p> <p>'At present it's very difficult to find the tracks that you want using Napster. It's often very slow, the names of the artists are sometimes wrong, it sends you to hard drives that are not that reliable. If I wanted to create my own compilation of tracks it's a long, hard slog. If the music industry could offer these sort of improved services, I believe that people would be willing to pay for the service,' Marathe said. </p> <p>But so far the music industry has been slow to react, choosing simply to swat the pirates with legal action. This is not a viable strategy for the future. The major record labels know that, whatever the Napster court case ruling, the judgment will ultimately change nothing. Other sites will always spring up to take its place. </p> <p>It may well be that Napster is heading for an early demise. So what? Long live Napster. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mp3.com\">www.mp3.com</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.napster.com\">www.napster.com</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.gnutella.wego.com\">www.gnutella.com</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.mydivx.com\">www.mydivx.com</a></p>",

  "When Flemish nationalist Filip DeWinter, exultant after his rapid advance in local elections, talks of 'zero tolerance', the immigrants of Antwerp know what he means. And they are apprehensive. <p>I met DeWinter in the headquarters of his Vlaams Blok party here, and he told me: 'I think that sometimes the police in Antwerp are too much like social workers.' He added: 'We want them to be more like the police - not like social workers.' </p> <p>His party, which won 20 of the city's 50 council seats, has made scapegoats of immigrants in a city with an ethnic element of less than 13 per cent in its population of 485,000. It has blamed them for a rise in crime. It also wants Flemish independence and is against abortion. </p> <p>DeWinter arrived for our meeting nearly half an hour late. Along with the Austrian Freedom Party's hero, J\u00f6rg Haider, he is the new face of right-wing politics in Europe. The suit is fresh but the eyes are close-set, the mouth curved in an unending sneer. His figure is tall and bullish. </p> <p>He describes his policies with enthusiasm. He sweeps aside the doctrine of multiculturalism: 'I don't believe in all these cultures living together. We are the bosses around here. I don't like that people adopt little pieces out of other cultures. </p> <p>'What is wrong with purity? We should not try to organise some kind of multicultural society. If I want to experience other cultures, I will go to other countries. </p> <p>'I sometimes go into the Moroccan communities. These Moroccan restaurants, they have Arabic writing on the walls. And the music they play. The women dress in hijabs. It's not our culture, and I feel threatened. What is wrong with these people adopting our way of life? They should assimilate into our way of life or leave.' </p> <p>DeWinter hopes to run the city by forming a coalition with conservatives, but is unlikely to succeed. In the city centre, only streets away from the city's halal butchers, staff at the Federation of Moroccan Organisations still struggle to digest last Sunday's election results. The group represents 50 ethnic welfare organisations. </p> <p>'How do you think we feel,' says Muhammad Shakar, the director. 'We're living in a city where almost a third of the population voted for Vlaams Blok. Imagine a Turkish child at school being taught by a teacher who has voted for DeWinter. Do you think that teacher will have a clear head when it comes to marking that boy's exams?' </p> <p>Shakar's primary concern is Vlaams Blok's calls for an extra 600 police in Antwerp. The city already has a force of nearly 1,800. Zero tolerance, says Shakar, as practised in New York, has targeted immigrant communities. </p> <p>'We'll all be suspects,' he says. 'One handbag will be stolen and 100 Moroccan youths will be arrested. DeWinter is always talking about New York as a blueprint, but look at the civil rights abuses committed by the police there.' </p> <p>Later on Wednesday, a group of Moroccan teenagers stand sharing cigarettes outside a sweet shop in Amerikalie Street. Dressed in the international urban uniform - baggy jeans and throwover anoraks - they huddle together against a chilly wind. </p> <p>The Vlaams Blok office can be seen down the street. 'You have an interview with DeWinter?', asks Fatah Hajaj. He laughs: 'Make sure you bomb that building.' </p> <p>Hajaj and his three friends could barely wait to finish school. Earlier in the day, Shakar had described the city's ethnic teenagers as 'the no-future generation'. </p> <p>Only 10 per cent of the Moroccan children opt for further education. 'There are no jobs for us, so why should we study?' asks Hajaj. 'There is very little for us to do. With Vlaams Blok in power, there will be even less for us to do.' </p> <p>Vlaams Blok has exploited the fear of immigrant crime. A recent pamphlet depicts a city overrun by immigrants - a cartoon depicts an Arab restaurant whose speciality is a bombe surprise . </p> <p>A city-centre gun battle between the Eastern European mafia and the police two weeks ago provided vital votes for Vlaams Blok at the council elections. </p> <p>After the interview with DeWinter, his secretary calls The Observer a taxi. She worked as an au pair in London - 'I liked the city,' she says. 'Every part is so different'. Asked to translate some posters on the walls, she is sheepish. 'You don't understand,' she says. 'Some of these Moroccans are like terrorists. We find them very threatening.' </p> <p>Does Vlaams Blok have any Asian members? 'Yes,' she says.

  "They were both classic underworld hits. Last month Michel Auger, one of Canada's top investigative journalists, was climbing out of his car at the office of Le Journal de Montreal when a man in a balaclava came up behind him and shot him five times with a handgun. Two weeks ago, antiques dealer Alan Decabral, the man who helped put road-rage killer Kenneth Noye behind bars, was sitting in his son's car outside Halfords in Ashford, Kent, when a man appeared at his window and shot him once in the side of the head. <p>The two incidents were thousands of miles apart and had different outcomes - Auger is still alive, whereas Decabral died instantly - but detectives believe the attacks could be linked to a rapidly escalating war between biker gangs, fighting for control of a lucrative drug trade. The Canadian Hell's Angels have been linked to a string of murders and police are investigating a theory that Decabral, a member of a British biker gang, may have crossed them over a drugs deal - and paid the price. </p> <p>Initially, the finger of suspicion in the Decabral murder pointed at Noye, who is one of Britain's most dangerous men and a serial bearer of grudges. Decabral had given evidence at the Old Bailey trial into the murder of Stephen Cameron that Noye had stabbed Cameron and then walked nonchalantly back to his Range Rover. Decabral dialled 999 and gave chase in his Rolls Royce before losing Noye. There were reports that he received death threats shortly before taking the stand; that three bullets were pushed through his letter box. </p> <p>The stress of playing a key role in Noye's downfall was said to be so great that Decabral's wife left him. He was forced to shut his business and moved to the quiet village of Pluckley in Kent. Eight weeks before he was killed, he told a newspaper that he spent all his time looking over his shoulder. </p> <p>For a man supposedly living in fear, Decabral took few precautions. He had been offered, but refused, police protection. He had continued using his own name and made little attempt to blend into the shadows. Weighing more than 20 stone with a distinctive beard and hair, Decabral was well-known in his village and beyond. His notoriety grew further after he was banned from his local pub after fighting with another customer. </p> <p>Far from being an innocent victim of the underworld, Decabral was closely allied with some of Britain's most powerful villains. The 40-year-old father-of-three was a high-ranking underworld fixer: villains turned to him when they needed guns, drugs or the services of a money launderer. </p> <p>Customs have confirmed that Decabral ran a team of bootleggers bringing back illicit booze and tobacco from the continent. He had 56 guns in his house, including machine guns and automatic pistols. </p> <p>That Decabral had found a way of making crime pay is not in doubt. His \u00a3350,000 house in Pluckley was bought without a mortgage, he owned a number of vehicles including a Rolls-Royce and a Jaguar and, when his house was raided a few months before his death, police found a \u00a3100,000 stash of \u00a350 notes. There had been three raids on the home in the 18 months before his death. Ironically, Noye's defence team were planning to use this information in an attempt to discredit Decabral as a witness in the upcoming appeal hearing. Far from giving Noye the satisfaction of revenge, Decabral's death could scupper his plans for shortening his sentence. </p> <p>Above all, Decabral was a biker. Not an enthusiast, not a collector, but a committed, hard-core gang member. A former Hell's Angel. Although the majority of bike gang members are simply enthusiasts, a hard-core of professional criminals exists. Tracked across the world by the FBI and the National Criminal Intelligence Service, these \u00e9lite members are involved in drug trafficking, protection and prostitution. Decabral was believed to be a key member of this group. </p> <p>The Hell's Angels are the most notorious of all the bike gangs. They are also by far the most active in criminal circles and guard this position fiercely. In Scandinavia, a war between the Angels and their rivals, the Bandidos, has left more than 25 dead in the past five years. Inter-gang violence in the UK is rarer but still happens: three years ago, two members of the Outcasts gang were murdered by Hell's Angels in south London. </p> <p>A few years earlier, Michael 'Long Mick' Rowledge, a member of the Hell's Angels' Windsor chapter, was shot dead in Liverpool while waiting to collect payment on a drug debt from a local gang. </p> <p>However, the most vicious biker gangs in the world are to be found in Canada. In Quebec alone, more than 150 bikers have been killed in the past six years. Canadian Angels are also highly placed in the world of drug trafficking. A recent raid recovered more than \u00a36 million of cocaine. The morning that Auger was shot, he had written a major expos\u00e9 about criminal activity in biker gangs. </p> <p>The fear now is that the war is spilling across the Atlantic. The Outcasts murdered by the Hell's Angels allegedly died because the Angels had been warned by their American counterparts to do more to maintain their reputation. </p> <p>While Hell's Angels around the world consider fellow club members to be their brothers, the links between those in Britain and those in Canada are some of the strongest. When Robert 'Snake' Tremblay was forced to go on the run from Montreal after murdering five bikers, he came to Britain where members of the London chapter fixed him up with a flat in Bermondsey. In 1994, when detectives swooped on a London hotel to arrest two Canadian Angels, they found a wealth of evidence of links with their British counterparts. </p> <p>A spokesman from the National Criminal Intelligence Service confirmed that police officers in the UK are in regular contact with their colleagues in Canada and that firm links between the international chapters of the Angels and other gangs continue to function. </p> <p>The intimate details of Decabral's deals with the Angels are still being uncovered. One theory is that he was trying to sell drugs and guns to rival biker factions; another is that he had tried to sell sub-standard products at an over-inflated price. Yet another suggests that Decabral, something of a playboy with several women on the go, had become involved with the girlfriend of a major biker figure. </p> <p>Whatever the motivation, the smart money believes that Decabral knew all along who was after him. He had turned down police protection after the Noye trial because he knew he would never be able to make any money with police officers looking over his shoulder. Once the threats from his eventual executioners started, going to the police would simply have put him in even more danger. Instead he went to the press, concocting stories about threats and bullets through his letter box - Decabral's friends and family have no knowledge of such an incident ever occurring - and betting that the publicity surrounding him would deter any potential assassin. He lost.</p>",
  "<b>Clarissa Dickson Wright:</b> When I was 10 I started spending holidays with my friend Christine who lived in a village in Sussex. My first memory of Johnny is going to a barbecue in a nearby village and this immensely scruffy little redheaded boy saying to me, 'Do you want to see my ferrets?' We banded together, roaming about the countryside and going to parties. I didn't have a crush on him, neither of us were each other's type, but I had a touch of hero worship - he could ride anything. <p>He went off to some strange places, jackerooing in Australia, while I went to university to study law. When he came back I had graduated and he started farming in Sussex and Kent, then moved north. About this time my drinking was kicking in.</p> <p>I isolated myself. Johnny saw me at the height of my drinking and was really sad about the state I'd got myself into. When I got sober, I didn't make much effort to get back in touch. I moved to Scotland about seven years ago, and one day Henry, my partner in the bookshop, told me we had a mutual friend. He dialled a number and handed me the telephone. I said, 'Hello, this is Clarissa, who is that?' and the other person, in a distinctive butterscotch voice said, 'Hello Petal.' Nobody else has ever called me Petal.</p> <p>Johnny was living about 20 minutes away from me on an 8,000-acre hill farm with 1,500 sheep, a wife Mary and two children. Johnny and I just picked up from where we left off as the closest of friends. When the BBC approached me about doing a countryside programme, I told them that I couldn't do it without Johnny. If he didn't translate well to camera, I wanted him as a consultant because he is the best countryman I know. Just as well, because I needed his support during filming. </p> <p>About a month before filming started last December, I was in Spain on holiday and my hernia tore. When we filmed the first day, I'd literally had stitches out the day before and I was feeling like shit. </p> <p>One of the first things that I was required to do for the show was walk six miles across a salt marsh in wellington boots, and Johnny was a brick. He just kept me laughing with his wonderfully witty sense of humour. </p> <p>Jennifer Paterson and I were brought together like the Spice Girls. I was fond of her but there were great difficulties working with her, especially in the afternoon. She liked to drink and it was hard representing a friendship that wasn't there. With Clarissa and the Countryman [BBC2, 8pm, starting Friday] it's the real thing.</p> <p><b>Johnny Scott:</b> The countryside was a Pandora's box of treasures for Clarissa. My upbringing was completely rural and I had all the things in life that she didn't. She was the most exuberant person I knew, so it was particularly sad to see her become so ill. Alcoholism is such a powerful illness and what causes it is terribly complex. In Clarissa's case, she was dreadfully upset at the death of her mother. Clarissa never married although she lived with someone for a number of years. He died tragically. </p> <p>Things were going desperately wrong for her - she'd given up a brilliant career as a barrister, she had terrible money problems and the last time I saw her before she got sober she was unrecognisable. I did fear she wasn't going to make it. Her courage saved her. When she called me a few years later, it was the same exuberant voice on the telephone telling me she was in Edinburgh. It was wonderful to have such a dear old friend living so close by. She had dried out and started to rebuild her life.</p> <p>She'd always had an interest in food and that led her to The Cooks Bookshop in Edinburgh. She soon became an authority on cooking. Anything she does with seafood is wonderful, and we share a love of British beef and game. Some time later came Two Fat Ladies.</p> <p>Clarissa has always been an enormously supportive friend and has the ability to think laterally. We often eat together, and go to the theatre. We might go fishing for trout on the river where I live or to the races. As with any close friendship, there are numerous times when she's been there for me, and I for her. We share the problems of life together.</p>",
  "Those three little words no one wants to hear: you have cancer. The depth of the dread is probably why so many of us know so little about it, preferring to muck around with myths and half-truths. Both my parents had it. My wife is fully recovered from a skin melanoma. One of my best friends survived bowel cancer in his mid-twenties. And still my ignorance was wilfully deep. <p>Nor is it just us civilians who feel that way. 'Even the medical profession hides from the truth,' the doctor in our family told me. </p> <p>'I had an old and highly respected Harley Street specialist come to me and say he'd had bleeding from his rectum for some time - what might be wrong? Of course he knew it was colorectal cancer. He just didn't want to know. And when you tell people they have cancer, they ask as few questions as possible.'</p> <p>So let's tackle the questions we all find so hard to ask - and uncover the truth behind some of our myths.</p> <p><b> 1 You can catch it just like you catch a cold </b></p> <p>No, it's not a droplet disease. Nor is it water-borne like, say, cholera. But it's possible to catch diseases and viruses which can lead to it. Around 15 per cent of cancers worldwide are caused this way. Cervical cancer, for example, is virtually always (99.7 per cent) a consequence of HPV, a sexually transmitted infection. Liver cancer is 100 times more likely in hepatitis B victims - which is why it's one of the few cancers where the Third World has a lead over us. The major risk factor is that babies are infected by their mothers. </p> <p><b> 2 Flying gives you leukaemia</b></p> <p>Only if you are a long-term commercial pilot - in which case you are five times more likely to get it. The effect is related to the high number of hours flown and only applies to those who have put in more than 5,000 hours. Even serial business flyers like Rupert Murdoch don't rack up hours like that, so it's a purely professional risk. It's most likely caused by cosmic radiation which increases with altitude. So the higher you fly, the more marked the effect - presumably Concorde pilots ran (or flew) the greatest risk. The link was established by Dr Hans Storm of the Institute of Epidemiology, Copenhagen. 'The only way to avoid it,' he said, 'would be to limit the number of hours pilots are allowed to fly, just as they do with nuclear workers.' Airline pilots are also three times as likely to get skin cancer, but that's because they take more holidays in the sun.</p> <p><b> 3 City life gives you cancer</b></p> <p>No, there is no difference in incidence rate between our towns and our countryside. The same doesn't seem to be true, though, for survival rates. An Aberdeen University study found that rural Scots with stomach cancer were four times more likely to die before it was diagnosed. For breast cancer, it's three times. Why? Because country dwellers have worse access to specialist care than their town cousins.</p> <p><b> 4 It's man-made chemicals that are to blame</b></p> <p>Not really. Epidemiologists look elsewhere for the causes, by and large. The BMA estimates that 1 per cent of cancers are caused by food additives. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) says no more than 1 per cent of all cancers are a result of man-made chemicals. It's true that a 1999 German report and a more recent one by the US Environmental Protection Agency pointed the finger at dioxins, even coming up with a figure of their being responsible for 12 per cent of human cancers in industrialised countries. Other scientists, while not disputing that dioxins are poisonous, doubt that they are ingested in sufficient quantities and point out that there is no causal link evidence. There is no real evidence of increased cancers in Seveso, site of the worst dioxin exposure and the much-vaunted leukaemia link with water pollution in Worcester, Massachusetts - as recounted in the movie A Civil Action - is almost certainly false. Staggeringly, a majority of US citizens, when polled by the Discovery Channel, said they thought air pollution carried as big a cancer risk as heavy smoking. That's pretty much on a level with thinking the moon's made of green cheese. Still, maybe it's no coincidence. Believing some nasty big business out there is to blame for cancer has two advantages - it stops being your responsibility and, perhaps more importantly in the lawyer-heavy US, it affords you the opportunity to sue the bejaysus out of them. </p> <p><b> 5 There is more and more and more of it around</b></p> <p>Well, yes, but this is mostly because more of us live longer. It's overwhelmingly a disease of age - nearly two-thirds of all cancers occur in the over-65s. Also, fewer of us are dying of other diseases - and, death being death, we've all got to die of something. Still, even the age-standardised rates have risen. From 1971 to 1997, levels rose 13 per cent in men and 34 per cent in women. More recently, though, there has been a significant decline in male cancer - down 5.75 per cent since 1994. This is probably because of the long-term drop in lung- cancer rates - down 33 per cent from 1986 to 1997. Female cancers, though, have risen a little recently, but they're still below their 1992 peak. In the US, by the way, it's fallen even faster - 10 per cent down overall since the 1992 peak. </p> <p><b> 6 Every second person seems to have it</b></p> <p>Almost. In the US, 48 per cent and 37 per cent of women will get cancer at some point during their life. The UK figure is a little lower. According to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF), just over one in three will get it, one in four will die of it. Currently, the male five-year survival rate is just 31 per cent, while the female is 43 per cent. Five years is the cancer experts' preferred definition of 'survival'.</p> <p><b> 7 There was some blood in my stools for a bit, but then it stopped, so I haven't got cancer</b></p> <p>Maybe, maybe not. Cancerous polyps do bleed intermittently. </p> <p><b> 8 Cervical cancer is a promiscuity thing</b></p> <p>Afraid so. The younger a woman is when she first has sex and the more sexual partners she has in her lifetime, the greater her chance of getting cervical cancer. That's because it's one of the few cancers caused by something you can catch. More than 99 per cent of women who get it have the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Male promiscuity is also a major cause - women who've only had one partner also get HPV. Male promiscuity, combined with lower hygiene levels, is often the problem in the Third World - men catch HPV from prostitutes and infect their wives and lovers. Colombia, for example, has the world's highest rate. There is an HPV test, but trials have had varying results. In some, it's proved accurate. In others, it has produced a number of both false-positives and false-negatives - though the trials weren't large enough to establish whether the numbers were unacceptably large. As recently as September 1999, Dr Peter Sasieni of the ICRF said that adding it routinely 'would certainly lead to greatly increased costs without necessarily significantly decreasing the amount of cancers'. However, both he and the ICRF now believe 'that HPV testing holds great promise as a primary screening method. It has an abnormality detection rate of about 90 per cent compared to 75 or less for a smear test.' Currently, it's being tested on borderline cases - still 250,000 a year. Cervical screening is already working. It cut cases by 42 per cent between 1988 and 1997, and deaths have fallen by 50 per cent in the last 15 years.</p> <p><b> 9 Male circumcision prevents cervical cancer</b></p> <p>There is some evidence for this. In India, Muslim women have a lower rate of cervical cancer than Hindus and Christians. It certainly seems to prevent penile cancer, which is virtually never seen in circumcised men.</p> <p><b> 10 I've got genital warts: that means cervical cancer somewhere down the line, right?</b></p> <p>Almost certainly not. When it comes to cervical cancer, if you can see the problem with the naked eye, it means you haven't got a problem. Nasty but true. More than 60 variants of HPV have been identified. Genital warts are produced by HPV Types 6 and 11, which have no link with cervical cancer. The danger ones are HPV 16, 18, 33, 35 and 45. The big problem is they're mostly 'silent'. Many of us have these HPVs, very few of us know it - a big deal when your chances with cervical cancer are directly related to the disease's progress by the time of diagnosis. Have a pap smear, basically. Because, in the words of the American National Cancer Institute, 'properly treated, tumour control of cervical cancer should be nearly 100 per cent.'</p> <p><b> 11 Extremely overweight people are more likely to develop it</b></p> <p>Some American sources say there is a connection between obesity and cancer. The ICRF says the link is not clear. There are two exceptions, though. Obese women are three to five times more likely to get endometrial (lining of the uterus) cancer and obese post-menopausal women run an increased risk of breast cancer.</p> <p><b> 12 More men die of testicular cancer than women do of breast cancer</b></p> <p>Not so. Testicular cancer is a very rare disease. It accounts for just one per cent of male cancers - in England and Wales in 1999, 71 died of it, compared to the 11,548 women who died of breast cancer. Incidence has doubled over the last 20 years - though it may now be on the decline since a 1996 peak. It is one of the few cancers that attacks the young. Nine out of 10 cases are in under-55s - and non-descended testicles by the age of seven is a strong indicator for it. The survival rate is excellent, however - almost 95 per cent.</p> <p><b> 13 OK then, more men die of prostate cancer than women of breast cancer</b></p> <p>Wrong again, though the figures are a little closer. Breast cancer is the leading killer disease for women between 35 and 54. According to the Office for National Statistics, the lifetime risk is one in nine. Prostate cancer, by contrast, is a one in 14 shot - still 10,000 deaths a year, with a 41 per cent survival rate. Breast cancer survival rates are rapidly improving, though. It kills some 13,000 British women a year, of the 35,000 who develop it. But that is far better than it was. Since the late 80s, when we had one of the lowest survival rates in Europe, deaths have fallen by 30 per cent, faster than anywhere else in the world. That was from a very high starting point, though, so more women are still dying in Britain than in America, Australia and some of Europe.</p> <p><b> 14 Breast cancer is killing more and more young women</b></p> <p>Definitely not. Death rates have been reduced by 30 per cent in young and middle-aged victims - mostly because of the efficacy of tamoxifen, a cheap and effective drug which blocks hormone receptors on cancer cells, interfering with their growth. It probably saves more lives than any other form of non-surgical cancer treatment. In younger women, chemotherapy after surgery has made a bid difference to death rates.</p> <p><b> 15 Left-handers are more likely to get breast cancer, so are virgins</b></p> <p>Yes and yes. The left-hand difference - which is 'modest' - was reported in the journal Epidemiology. A suggestion is that there is a link to the hypothesis that intrauterine exposure to steroid hormones may play a role in the development of breast cancer, as well as influencing handedness. Virgins are more likely to get it because they don't have children. Breast cancer is closely linked to oestrogen levels. Asian women in Asia, for example, have low levels of both -and British women high ones. Having babies, particularly when you're young, lowers the risk. By contrast, the fewer children you have, the greater your risk. Other risks are late menopause and having a first child after 30 - the older you are, the greater the danger. According to Dr Hilakivi-Clarke of the AICR, it now seems that the impact of high oestrogen levels varies through a woman's life. In the reproductive years, they have no effect at all. In the womb and after menopause, they increase the risk. During childhood, they now appear to play a 'powerful protective role'. </p> <p><b> 16 Routine mammograms are a waste of time for over-65s</b></p> <p>No, says the US. Yes, said the ICRF till just the other week - 'There is no good medical reason to justify the decision.' No, it now says. In the last week of September, the government announced that routine screening would be extended to 65- to 70-year-olds by 2004.</p> <p><b> 17 I've got a painful lump in my breast, so I must have cancer</b></p> <p>Most likely not - 90 per cent of breast cancer tumours are not painful, according to a clinician. It is far more likely to be an abscess, which is then always painful.</p> <p><b> 18 Every man, if he lived long enough, would eventually get prostate cancer</b></p> <p>Probably. The death toll has doubled over the last 20 years, and in 20 years' time, 50,000 men a year will get it. According to Dr Peter Sasieni, statistician for the ICRF, 40 per cent of all 80-year-old men have it - this was established through post-mortems. Many won't know they've got it, as it develops slowly and they'll die of something else first. 'You can assume that the incidence increases with age. So if men lived to over 120 or so, it is possible they would all get prostate cancer.' But not necessarily die of it. It looks as if there could well be a form of prostate cancer that just sits there and grows very slowly.</p> <p><b> 19 The PSA test has transformed the survival rate for prostate cancer</b></p> <p>The jury's out on this. In the US, prostate cancer deaths have dropped 10 per cent since the early 90s - both experts and patient groups attribute this to the prostate-specific antigen test (PSA) which is a simple blood test. Experts here are nowhere near as convinced, pointing out the test's low accuracy level - it produces an unacceptable number of both false-positives and false-negatives. One of the big problems is figuring out whether a tumour is aggressive or not. New research seems to have pinpointed the eight genes which are responsible for the disease.</p> <p><b> 20 Black Americans are more likely to get prostate cancer than whites</b></p> <p> True. No one knows why. </p> <p><b> 21 There's this Chinese herb stuff which really zaps prostate cancer</b></p> <p>Absolutely. Western researchers call it PC-SPES. It's an over-the-counter powder supplement with eight different plants in it: isatis, liquorice, lucid ganoderma, pseudo-ginseng, rubescens, saw palmetto and scute. Research is at an early stage, but when rats on PC-SPES were injected with cancer cells, only 60 per cent of them got tumours - compared to the usual 99. Lab tests by Dr Jan Geliebter of New York Medical College further showed that PC-SPES 'strongly inhibits' the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture.</p> <p><b> 22 So vegetarians get less cancer</b></p> <p>No. Eating five portions of fruit and veg a day - whether you're a carnivore, a vegetarian or a vegan - is the thing that could keep Mr C away, or at least make him less likely to come calling. For 20 years, experts have pointed out that red meat and saturated fats are laden with the bad stuff - the chemicals that kick off the process which leads to cancer - while the good stuff is in fruit and vegetables: phytochemicals and antioxidants which fight it. The conclusion propounded was that meat-eating was the problem. Not so. A recent piece of research by the ICRF found that vegetarians are just as likely to die of bowel cancer as meat eaters. Nor was there any difference in breast, prostate, lung or stomach cancer. 'Our analysis suggests that meat itself may have little effect on the development of the disease,' says the ICRF's Dr Timothy Key - a fairly categorical statement by scientific standards. Another study, by the US National Cancer Institute, found that people on a low-fat, high-fibre diet seemed to stand as much chance of developing pre-cancerous growths in their colons as those who steaked up and burgered out. But it's hard to know what to read into that. Questions are definitely begged. What do pre-cancerous growths, for example, have to say about cancerous ones? And what about cancers outside the colon? Still, a recent AICR expert review of 247 studies found that 78 per cent showed that vegetables and fruit protected against cancer. So best keep having salad with those chips.</p> <p><b> 23 Garlic beats cancer</b></p> <p>A recent study-review by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) suggests that those who regularly eat garlic - raw or cooked - run half the risk of stomach cancer and two-thirds the risk of colon cancer. The AICR recommends eating two to five cloves a week or taking garlic supplements, though the UNC-CH found no benefit in supplements. Why does garlic help? The suggestion is it's because it attacks helicobacter pylori which is closely linked to stomach cancer.</p> <p><b> 24 Fruit juice stops you getting cancer </b></p> <p>It probably helps. A glass of juice counts as one portion of the five a day of fruit and vegetables that the WHO and other experts say will lower your risk. For these purposes, by the way, potatoes and nuts don't count as vegetables.</p> <p><b> 25 Vegans, then. They get less cancer</b></p> <p>They certainly have lower levels of IGF-I - Insulin-like Growth Factor-I - which increases the risk of prostate cancer. 'Even small differences are predictive,' says Dr Timothy Key. Low levels are found in places where little meat or dairy products are eaten. An ICRF study revealed that IGF-I levels are 9 per cent lower in vegans than in meat eaters. However, says an epidemiologist, 'studies with big leaps of faith - the technical term is \"proxy outcomes\" - from a chemical to a disease don't get me too excited.'</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,382676,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Read the second part of Truths and myths here</a></p>",

  "<p>This year is the third Channel 4 Power List and already a trend is clear; power is becoming progressively privatised. The formal centres of political and governing power, while still important, increasingly jostle for a ranking alongside the leaders of the giant corporations, the playmakers of the information and communications revolution and the custodians of the high-street brands that capture our buying imagination. </p> <p>Nor are they the only challenge to the rule of politicians, judges and civil servants. Television chefs, football managers, a Radio 1 DJ and the creator of Harry Potter were all felt to command an important place in the listings - hardly surprising given that the criterion for selection was the 'capacity to influence the quality of people's lives, lifestyles and values in Britain today'. Power in contemporary Britain has many sources beyond Whitehall and Westminster. </p> <p>It is a measure of the civilisation in which we now live that only one Minister outside the Cabinet - Michael Meacher (No 202) - was included in the list when a number inside it did not merit inclusion inside the top 300. The royal family continue to sink, with both the Queen and Prince Charles ranking below the new royals - David and Victoria Beckham. No fewer than 16 Americans figured in the top 100 names, reflecting the growing importance of US power. But there were only eight women - and of those, two, the Queen and Cherie Booth, can hardly be regarded as normal candidates. The powerful are male, middle-aged and white. </p> <p>Despite the rise of the corporate and private sectors, the two most powerful white, middle-aged males in Britain are politicians, Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. Brown has won the No 2 spot that two years ago was held by Rupert Murdoch and last year by Bill Gates. It has become ever clearer that the Chancellor is the animating intellectual, economic and political force behind New Labour, and the judges seriously discussed whether he even deserved to be No 1. It is Brown, after all, who has designed every significant New Labour economic and social policy, and it is his judgment that will settle the key political decisions on the euro and the timing of the next general election. On the other hand, it is the Prime Minister who has last say over patronage and appointment, over which Blair retains a tight control; it is Blair who decides on policy towards, say, the House of Lords; he also led the war in Kosovo. On those grounds he deserves (just) to be No 1. </p> <p>But if Blair and Brown are powerful, it is a power more constrained and limited than ever before. There is the awesome and rising power of the right-wing tabloid press, reflected in the upward move in the rankings for the third successive year of David Yelland, editor of the Sun (34) and the ever-high position of Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of the Daily Mail (23), that together aggressively articulate the still dominant conservative ascendancy. The leader of the petrol protest, Brynle Williams, enters the list (254), along with the Countryside Alliance's chief executive, Richard Burge (197), as exponents of conservative direct activism - while William Hague has jumped to 50, a tribute to the Tory leader's capacity to exploit (until this month's debacle over on-the-spot fines for cannabis possession) populism to serve his cause. </p> <p>Those forces represent but one constraint on New Labour's power. There is the sheer weight of corporate power, with Sir John Browne of BP and Chris Gent of Vodafone (10 and 12 respectively). Independent central bankers Alan Greenspan (president of the US Federal Reserve) and Sir Eddie George (3 and 6) pay tribute to the power of the financial markets and their crucial role in determining interest rates. Steve Case, the architect of the AOL-Time Warner merger creating the world's largest corporation, Bill Gates and John Chambers, the president of Cisco Systems, (4, 8 and 11) represent not only the extraordinary transformatory dynamism of the new economy but their pivotal role as developers and gatekeepers of the new networks. Indeed, IT companies and the brains behind the hi-tech revolution are even better represented than last year. Two politicians may top the list, but the world they rule is a conservative business civilisation moving from being organised around factories and offices to one organised around networks - and which has a momentum and force independent of government. </p> <p>Indeed the powerful grip of not just the internet but the entire information revolution extends across the entire 300 names. The explosion of mobile-phone use is not only represented by Vodafone, but by Hans Snook of Orange (58). Shawn Fanning, the 19-year-old who invented Napster, which allows downloading of music from the net, enters the list at 189, and Professor Manuel Castells, dubbed the 'first great philosopher of cyberspace', is ranked at 139. Novelist William Gibson, the man whocoined the term cyberspace, joins the ranking at 288 - and the massive growth of computer games is reflected in the No 15 position of Nobuyuki Idei as head of Sony, which has sold 4 million PlayStations in Britain. Satosha Tajiri, who invented Pok\u00e9mon, is a new entry at 123. Many of the scientists in the list are closely connected to IT - or like the architects of genomics, John Sulston (116) and Craig Ventor (117), have made their advances in disciplines that are closely related. </p> <p>But in a world in which the capacity to digitalise, network and download is becoming ever more important and transformatory - so accelerating a bewildering new volatility and pace of change - people still need durable landmarks around which to organise themselves. They look less to religion - the only representative of organised religion, Pope John Paul II, ranks at 262, falling for the third successive year - but to the certainties provided by solid branding, a surrogate for community membership. The phenomenon is multi-faced. It lies behind the entry into the list at 203 of advertising guru Trevor Beattie, the man who gave us the Wonderbra ads and fcuk. McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Pret A Manger and Nike are all brand names that have made it to the list before, but Howard Schultz, the originator of Starbucks and cappuccino capitalism, is a new entry at 100. As is Frenchman Bernard Arnault (104), the architect of Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, a company that lives by its luxury brands ranging from Dior to Louis Vuitton. Stelios Haji-Ioannou (79) is the entrepreneur behind easyJet, and even Tiger Woods's entry into the list at 224 is in part because he has rebranded golf. </p> <p>The media, the vehicle by which brands and imagery are promoted, is as heavily represented as ever - although this year, reflecting the power of clubbing and dance music, Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong has made the list at 146. </p> <p>Indeed, if the list is any indicator, the British are growing more fun-loving and interested in culture and sport. It is not just that Sir Nicholas Serota, the man behind Tate Modern, has risen for the third year to 64; artists Tracey Emin (271) and Antony Gormley (298) are new entries representing the country's growing fascination with art. Sam Mendes, the director of American Beauty, enters at 223 and J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter stories, has jumped from 247 last year to 114. Jamie Oliver, the Naked Chef, is in the list at 241. Sport is more strongly represented, ranging from tennis's Williams sisters (245) to Formula 1 racing star David Coulthard (269). </p> <p>When The Observer and Channel 4 first compiled the Power List it was evident that while the House of Commons was still the most concentrated site of power in the country, it had a growing number of rivals. Two years later it is a trend more marked than ever.</p>",
  "<p>It will come as a relief to Tony Blair to find he is still regarded as the most powerful person in Britain. The Prime Minister, even when he was massively popular, has never felt himself to be the masterful controller of events which his propagandists have endeavoured to project. </p> <p>He looked quite out of control during this autumn of discontent over petrol prices, when his Government was overwhelmed by the bunch of self-described nobodies who picketed oil refineries. For a brief but dangerous period, the fuel protesters throttling the national windpipe appeared to wield much more power than the country's elected leader. </p> <p>It will also be a source of satisfaction at Number 10 that Tony Blair is ranked just ahead of Gordon Brown. The Government is a dual monarchy of Prime Minister and Chancellor, with rival courts and jockeying agendas. There has rarely been such a tortuous and talented coupling at the peak of British politics. At its worst, the relationship descends to resentment-fuelled destructive feuding. At its best, they are creatively symbiotic. </p> <p>They need each other, though Blair tends to be more generous than Brown about acknowledging his debts to the other man. The Chancellor, who is privately disparaging of Blair's numeracy, has proved to be the first Labour steward of the economy to avoid a calamity. It is primarily to him that Labour owes the fact it approaches the next election with bulging surpluses with which to fructify the voters. </p> <p>Blair's sense of intellectual inferiority has often led him to defer to Brown, though the Prime Minister is more likely to assert himself against his mighty Chancellor these days than he was at the beginning of the Government's life. Blair has less rebarbative relations with Cabinet colleagues and a capacity to appeal to a wider public, which makes him better-equipped for the role of Prime Minister. </p> <p>For all the highly charged disputes that have raged between them behind closed doors, the competitive yet complementary relationship is the rock on which the Government has been built. So long as the two men are still talking to each other, even when the words exchanged are angry and expletive, the Blair-Brown axis will probably surmount its enormous tensions. Should this relationship ever go terminally wrong, it could be the rock on which the Government founders. </p> <p>The stress lines between Blair and Brown have been both expressed and aggravated by abrasion between their entourages. The influence of the unelected adviser in contemporary British politics is sunderlined by the high placings of Blair's focus group guru, Philip Gould (31); Brown's former chief counsellor, Ed Balls (30); and Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell (14). Most sensational is the rating of Alastair Campbell (5) as more important than any other member of the Cabinet except Blair and Brown. </p> <p>That the Number 10 Press Secretary should enjoy such prominence is a commentary on the emphasis placed on spin and manipulation by both New Labour and its critics. I am sure Campbell would modestly protest that perceptions of his influence are grossly exaggerated. But who was it who taught the country to think perception is 90 per cent of political power? </p> <p> Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of 'The Observer' and author of the bestseller, 'Servants of the People: The Inside Story of New Labour' (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a317.99).</p>",
  "<p>Last month, Brynle Williams won almost instant celebrity as leader of the fuel blockaders. The Welshman, who enters the Power List at 254, was part of a network of possibly fewer than 50 disaffected people (remarkably undetected by MI5 director Stephen Lander, 173) which operated from kitchen tables using a mobile phone tree and almost brought a major international economy to its knees. </p> <p>On this occasion, Williams and his almost anonymous co-conspirators demonstrated more clout than the editors of the Sun and the Daily Mail . When those papers had sponsored a 'dump the pump' campaign two months earlier, it fizzled out. </p> <p>If ordinary people want to exercise power in modern Britain, the most practical way - short of inveigling your way into a focus group run by Philip Gould (31) - is still to influence powerbrokers or their agendas directly. A small group of Women's Institute members jeered Tony Blair four months ago. The gesture exemplified a feeling that the Prime Minister was out of touch. In a world in which political dialogue is conducted in soundbites or memorable TV images, it resonated cruelly. </p> <p>Just like the fuel protesters, the Countryside Alliance is another impromptu collection of largely anonymous malcontents who have exercised disproportionate power in 2000 (chief executive Richard Burge is a new entry at 197). Almost all its sympathisers are socially conservative. Most are politically Conservative too. However, they have terrified a Labour government with a majority of 179 into a humiliating retreat on foxhunting and compromise on the right to roam. </p> <p>Just as few Labour MPs are practising Christians, and therefore often underestimate the pervasive influence of the church, few live, socialise or travel to the country. Their fear of this unquantified constituency is palpable. </p> <p>Ten years ago, a generation of campaigners saw that power was moving slowly from the old establishment to the boardrooms of international companies. They resolved, quaintly, to buy shares and thus to exert a powerful hold on the conscience of these firms. While they were right that power has been privatised, corporate Britain remains resolutely exclusive. </p> <p>Some of those idealists still duti fully attend annual general meetings to raise environmental concerns or vote against director re-election. They still find themselves outvoted millions to one by pension fund representatives who have already been squared over lunch. </p> <p>The new decade's anonymous powerbrokers are operating more shrewdly. At the Consumers' Association, chief executive Sheila McKechnie (171) has had more impact on reducing the prices of new cars than a catalogue of European Union directives. After moving to the organisation from Shelter - where she once terrified housing ministers - McKechnie threatened to start importing cheap cars on the internet. She was backed by the purchasing power of 600,000 affluent subscribers to Which? magazine, many of whom delayed making purchases of new cars as they expected the cost to fall. Less than a year later, every major British car distributor has reduced prices by up to 20 per cent. Expect further reductions. </p> <p>Greenpeace director Peter Melchett remains in the list (231), lower than last year when the GM foods crisis hit the headlines. However, his successful defence against charges of criminal damage to GM crops may set a powerful example to the middle classes. </p> <p>The next time there is a wave of public sentiment over exported veal calves, or excessive use of pesticides, or police racism, expect more 'respectable' people to feel entitled to sit down in the road and claim duress. </p> <p>Lobbyist Angela Mason stays in the list (265) slightly lower than last year after a battering over Section 28. Backed by thousands of supporters of equal treatment for gays and lesbians, the Stonewall director has kept ministers under pressure on law reform. As well as its public backers, a network of 'in' gay well-wishers - including professional footballers and FTSE-100 executives - supports the lobby group, sustaining momentum for legislative change. </p> <p>Whether country-dwellers, environmentalists, consumers or gays, it is the very anonymity, indeterminate number and unpredictability of these constituencies that frightens those in power. That is what gives Brynle Williams's supporters - and their imitators to come - their own significant stake in the matrix of power in Britain today.</p>",
  "<p>Russian market researcher Sergei Yashko sees hope in the Fairy washing-up liquid and Comet washing powder he found in a \u00a312-a-month household in a tiny village outside Samara, on the Volga river. 'This confirms that even in extremely poor rural areas, people have tried out western brands - and there is future potential,' he said. </p> <p>The growth of Russia's gigantic consumer market is one of the key drivers of economic recovery, Yashko insists. And most pundits agree. Domestic producers of value-for-money goods are doing a roaring trade and, aided by the fourfold rouble devaluation in 1998, are threatening to drive foreign companies from the market. </p> <p>Poverty remains a formidable obstacle to the market's growth. Average wages were 1,520 roubles (\u00a338) a month in 1999, according to state statistics. People below the official poverty line of 900 roubles a month include teachers, engineers, state-sector scientists and nurses. </p> <p>A survey by GfK, the Moscow marketing company for which Yashko works, showed that poor Russians typically supplement their monthly earnings of between \u00a38 and \u00a39 per person with between \u00a32 and \u00a33 from the 'grey' (unofficial) economy, and often grow some of their food on their country allotments (dachas). </p> <p>Their staple diet includes potatoes, bread, cheap vegetables, macaroni and porridge. They strictly limit consumption of meat, fish, fruits, cheese and sweets. Fairy Liquid, or a rival Russian brand, is measured out a drop at a time. </p> <p>The survey found that furniture and electrical appliances are mostly of Seventies vintage; holidays are usually with relatives or at the family dacha; and outings to the theatre or cinema rare. </p> <p>Where, then, is the scope for branded products? Yashko said: 'The possibilities in the consumer market are part of overall economic recovery. GDP has been increasing, and we expect it to rise by between 5 and 6 per cent in 2000. </p> <p>'Real incomes are increasing; the government has just put up the pensions and the pay of many state employees. There has been a substantial decline of unemployment.' Then there is the grey economy, which adds between a third and two-thirds. </p> <p>What cash consumers have is most likely to be spent on value-for-money goods churned out by the rising domestic producers - many of them learnt, but not necessarily copied, from western importers who made the running until the 1998 crash. </p> <p>So when that rural Samara household finally uses its last drop of Fairy Liquid, it may replace it with a domestically produced one. GfK says that before the 1998 meltdown, Fairy manufacturer Procter &amp; Gamble had 36 per cent (by volume) of the Russian detergents market; that fell to 14 per cent last April. </p> <p>In the same period the share of the detergents market held by all foreign manufacturers together fell from 71 per cent to 43 per cent by volume. </p> <p>They have also taken a pounding in the markets for shampoo (68 per cent down to 38 per cent by volume) and toothpaste (77 per cent to 49 per cent). The international producers' encroachment into the yellow fats market has been reversed, from 41 per cent back down to 23 per cent by volume. Domestic producers, such as Nevskaya Kosmetika of St Petersburg, have moved into the deodorants market, hitherto a foreigners' preserve. </p> <p>Devaluation drove the foreigners' premium brands u-market, towards the small group of better-off consumers. For the mass market, it was suddenly no longer cheaper to import than to produce locally. </p> <p>The foreign companies accelerated plans to establish factories in Russia, and launched high value brands to do battle with domestic companies - both historically strong ones such as chocolate makers Krasny Oktyabr and Rotfront, and post-Soviet newcomers such as Wimm-Bill-Dann, the milk products and juices market leader, and Kalina, the detergents and cosmetics maker. </p> <p>Danone, Campino and Ehrmann have all opened factories producing yoghurts and other milk-based products to challenge W-B-D's supremacy. Julia Belova, spokeswoman for W-B-D, said the company is ready to fight. 'The 1998 devaluation drove many other foreign producers out of the market, and our company gained. Six months after the crisis, our milk products output was back up to pre-crisis levels. By August last year it was 15 per cent higher, and it is still growing.' </p> <p>The increasing sophistication of counterfeiters is an extra problem for foreign brands. When I bought Duracell batteries from a Moscow stallholder last week, she cheerfully offered a choice of genuine ones at UK prices or 'licensed' copies selling at 75 per cent less. </p> <p>A check by Moscow trade inspectors last month showed that 70 per cent of products carrying P&amp;G brand names such as Blend-a-Med toothpaste, Head and Shoulders shampoo and Tide and Ariel washing powders were counterfeit. Andre Bader, public affairs manger of P&amp;G Russia said that figure was untypical. Its market research showed that counterfeits comprised between 3 and 20 per cent of sales, 'but naturally it's a problem for us'. </p> <p>Both local and international producers have difficulty second-guessing, or trying to alter, Russian tastes. On one hand, foreign mayonnaise brands - creamier and softer than their Russian counterparts - have scarcely made an impact. Ninety-six per cent of the market remains in local hands. On the other hand, yoghurt, which was unknown in Soviet times, has now achieved 70 per cent market penetration and is one of the pillars of W-B-D's success. </p> <p>Market reform has changed the Russian diet little. This year's state statistical survey shows that bread, potatoes, macaroni and other carbohydrates remain staples - for most of the rich as well as the poor. Tradition and the cold climate were blamed for this by Andrei Vavilov of the Consumption Research Institute. He told the newspaper Argumenti i Fakti: 'Whoever you are, your body will try to build a store of fats.' </p> <p>Yashko of GfK says it is especially difficult to guess how Russian consumers will react to crises. Take, for example, feminine protection, as unknown as yoghurt in Soviet times and now used by about half the relevant women. In the year after the 1998 crash, consumption fell by a third, along with more obviously luxury items such as deodorants, fabric conditioners and instant coffee. </p> <p>Perhaps the most significant cultural shift by Russian consumers is from vodka towards beer. The Russian breweries - the largest are owned by firms in Germany, Scandinavia and South Africa - have largely adopted western European manufacturing methods, producing a taste that drinkers prefer. </p> <p>The 1998 devaluation helped, all but driving foreign beer brands out of the market. Last year Russia brewed more than 95 per cent of the 4.3 billion litres of beer it drank, a total that was 27 per cent more than in 1998. </p> <p>The expansion has continued this year, and the only people happier than the producers are Health Ministry officials, who say vodka consumption and its associated alcoholism are falling. </p> <p>Overall alcohol intake - in which Russia is a world leader- is heading down from 15 litres per person a year to around 13, compared with the eight litres consumed annually in the UK. </p> <p>Whether other changes in Russian consumers' habits will be so unambiguously good for them is not yet clear. </p> <p><strong>A tale of two consumers</strong></p> <p>Irina, a state-sector printer, earns 1,200 roubles ($43.50) a month. Her husband Oleg is retired on a 600 roubles monthly pension but still works, earning an extra 2,000 roubles. </p> <p>They live in a large Moscow flat (rent: 300 roubles) with their grown-up daughters, one a teacher and one a nurse, and their 18-year-old student son. </p> <p>Irina says: 'We buy a lot of processed foods, Russian-made meat products for example. But we can not afford fruit. Sometimes I buy it for my son, to ensure he has vitamins, and I have to hide it from the others. We all drink Russian beer.' </p> <p>Chocolates and ice cream are for occasions. She buys clothes 'very rarely'. </p> <p>The family's fridge and washing machine are more than 20 years old. Buying a car is impossible. Irina and her daughters holiday with friends in north-west Russia, limiting the cost to 1,000 roubles a head in train fare. </p> <p>Irina shops only at the market and has never tried supermarkets, where prices are higher. She considers her family fortunate to have work and 'considerably' better off than pensioners and the unemployed. </p> <p>Leonid, a banker, earns $8,000 a month, and $400 of it goes on rent for his Moscow flat.'I rarely eat at home, since I work very long hours. If I do, I spend perhaps 200 to 300 roubles at a 24-hour shop. Otherwise I eat out, usually for about 1,000 roubles.' </p> <p>As well as a imported fridge and washing machine, Leonid has a $2,000 Russian notebook computer and a sound system that cost about the same. He spent $800 on 10 days' holiday in Cyprus this year and $4,000 on 20 days in Tibet last year. His extravagance, he says, is having a $100,000 house built on land he bought in a prestigious area of Moscow. </p> <p>Leonid travels to London every few months, partly to buy clothes, he says.</p>",
  "<p>US investors in technology firms could be forgiven for feeling a dismal sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu this weekend. After all, autumnal routs of the Nasdaq, the US stock market for hi-tech shares, are nothing new. Last October, as the dotcom bubble was starting to inflate, there was a panic sell-off of tech stocks prompted by cautious comments from Alan Greenspan after the chairman of the US Federal Reserve hinted at impending interest rate hikes. Seven per cent was wiped off Nasdaq's value in a week. </p> <p>But that slump was quickly turned around. Towards the end of last October, strong earnings from Microsoft helped send the Nasdaq on a gravity-defying surge. The index registered its third-highest daily rise and powered 400 points through the 3,000 mark within a fortnight. The Nasdaq continued to grow by around 500 points a month until it reached its record high of 5,132 in March. </p> <p>What a different story now. At the nadir of a bruising week, the index dropped more than 8 per cent to 3,074 by last Thursday - its lowest level since last November. On Friday the Nasdaq managed to rally 242 points to 3316. But it was not enough to disguise the fact that over the past six weeks the Nasdaq has shed some 1,200 points, about 30 per cent of its value. Now it stands barely above its position 12 months ago. The internet bubble has burst and no one is expecting an equivalent turnaround of the October blues this year. Indeed, despite Friday's rally, further fallout is likely. </p> <p>'There are companies that are trading at 25 per cent of their all-time high and I still think they're overvalued,' said Paul Deninger, chairman and chief executive officer of Broadview, the technology investment bank. </p> <p>These are likely to be the e-tailers - online retailers who came to market amid the internet euphoria and are now spectacularly failing to meet their predicted sales targets. Fuckedcompany.com, the website that lists all the latest e-tail failures, now has so many horror stories that it's become a must-visit destination, selling space on its pages as banner ads. </p> <p>But while many focus on the gradual, horrible demise of the e-ailers, these dotcom deaths are not the reason the Nasdaq is taking a battering. In fact it is the performance of some of the biggest companies rather than the minnows that are causing traders' screens to turn red. </p> <p>The list of big-name technology companies issuing profits warnings or disappointing results over the past couple of months makes for uncomfortable reading. Bellwethers such as Apple, Dell, Intel, Lucent Technologies, Oracle, and Motorola have all worried the market with downbeat statements. </p> <p>The problem for the tech bulls is that they have run out of new technologies to rave about. After the e-commerce explosion and the hype around the b2c (business-to-consumer) model came the b2b (business-to-business) model. But the plunge in the stellar values attached to online marketplaces forced an urgent reappraisal. </p> <p>Then came the m-commerce hype surrounding new technologies such as wireless application protocols, which link your handset to the world wide web. But the soaring costs of mobile phone licences and capital expenditure to build networks dampened investors' enthusiasm. </p> <p>Finally, the market turned its attention to the internet infrastructure companies, such as Lucent and Motorola, which build the bits of hardware that wire the world. Analysts said this represented a shift towards companies that make the shovels for the gold rush rather than the diggers themselves. But firms such as Lucent failed to live up to the analysts' outlandish predictions </p> <p>At each question mark in the past 12 months there arrived a new internet-related sector with a fresh justification as to why it was worth the hype. Punters both big and small swallowed the tales in droves. As Yale economics professor Robert Shiller noted in his book Irrational Exuberance published a few months ago: 'The market is high because of the combined effect of indifferent thinking by millions of people, very few of whom feel the need to perform careful research on the long-term investment value of the aggregate stock market, and who are motivated substantially by their own emotions, random attentions and perceptions of conventional wisdom.' </p> <p>The failure of some of the biggest tech companies to hit their earnings targets might not have been so bad if, ironically, the old economy had not suffered a series of palpitations in recent weeks. While tech stocks have been thought of as relatively immune to soaring fuel costs, the markets have now started to wake up to the fact that a threatened economic downturn will affect every business. Further concerns about a soft euro and the renewed threat of inflation also affect sentiment. </p> <p>'Until now people have firmly believed techs were in a structural bull phase and would not be hit by economic downturn,' said an analyst at HSBC. 'The market has changed its perception and now sees them more as high-growth cyclicals which could be very badly impacted.' </p> <p>While many still see the Nasdaq as fundamentally overvalued, it is clear that a healthy dollop of reality has returned to the market. As Deninger put it: 'The fact that something like Napster [the online pirate music site], whose fundamental business model involved breaking the law, could get funded by serious venture capitalists is testimony to the fact that this market was overhyped. The past nine months have been insane.'</p>",
  "<p>It was one of the most high-profile competition inquiries ever - and, at an estimated cost of \u00a320 million, one of the most expensive. The main tenet was unashamedly populist: the big supermarket groups are conspiring to rip off customers and bankrupt suppliers to keep their profit margins high. </p> <p>All the more embarrassing then that the industry has been so comprehensively let off the hook. As The Observer revealed last month, while the Commission found evidence of unfair competition and restrictive practices, which acted against the public interest, it is not recommending any major changes to address this. </p> <p>The supermarkets have es-caped unscathed. Their relief could, however, be short-lived. For the last two years the big food retailers have been paralysed by uncertainty. No one was brave enough to launch bids, engineer mergers or agree the alliances that have long been talked about, because of the risk that the Competition Commissioners would rule them out. </p> <p>Now that the final report has been made public, all that will change. The industry will be able to switch its attention from shouting about how competitive it is, to engineering deals to reduce the intensity of that competition. In-deed, some believe the report effectively gives the green light to any combination of the major companies, regardless of how large their share of shoppers' purses. The commissioners conclude that the supermarket industry is local: how many of us would drive more than 20 minutes to get to a supermarket, never mind travel to a different part of the country? </p> <p>Some analysts believe that means Tesco could, in theory, bid for Sainsbury, even though it would have more than 30 per cent of the national market, provided Tesco could demonstrate that it does not have a monopoly in any local area or was willing to sell stores where that could be a problem. </p> <p>In practice, however, Tesco would find it hard to do a deal with any of its British rivals. It is, by some way, the largest of the four big chains, with a share of over 17 per cent. Even Safeway, the smallest of the big four, has more than 10 per cent of the market so a bid would take it over the 25 per cent trigger for a competition referral. More worrying, however, is Tesco's dominance in the South of England. The Commissioners report that there are five areas, including Cambridge and Salisbury, where it has more than half the market, and some estimate that there are at least 70 areas where it has a 40 per cent share. Add in virtually any of the other majors and Tesco would end up having to sell so many sites that it would make the deal pointless. </p> <p>The one possible acquisition for Tesco is Wm Morrison, the Bradford-based chain. It is expanding southwards, but its strength is still in its northern homeland so the overlap with Tesco would be smaller than under any other combination. But it has been expertly run by the indomitable Ken Morrison for the past 40 years and he shows no signs of wanting to sell out. Even if he did, the rest of the Morrison family, who between them own more than 30 per cent of the company's shares, would be likely to demand an exceptionally high price. </p> <p>Family shareholdings also offer some protection at Sainsbury, generally acknowledged as the weakest of the big four. The protection is weakening, however. David Sainsbury, the last member of the founding family to work in the group, left the board two years ago, and even the most patient of the family shareholders must be growing irritated by the chain's recent poor performance. As with Morrisons, however, family loyalty means a bidder would have to pay a high price to win their acceptance for a bid. </p> <p>The alternative is a merger with one of the other groups. That could mean the Sainsbury name would continue, but give the family a smaller stake in a bigger group. </p> <p>Safeway, the smallest of the big four, is the obvious candidate. It is recovering rapidly under Carlos Criado-Perez, who learnt his skill at Wal-Mart. This is the combination that would most alarm Tesco. The merged company would be the clear market leader, and Sainsbury's strength in the South-east would complement Safeway's Scottish dominance. </p> <p>Tesco has almost as much to fear from a second possible combination, seen by some industry watchers as the most likely of the possible permutations: a takeover of Safeway by Wal-Mart, which would then put it with Asda, acquired two years ago. </p> <p>This potential combination has an impeccable logic. When the Asda deal was done, Wal-Mart made no secret of the fact that it intended to become the number one in Europe, just as it is in the US. It has a long way to go. Its German business, bought just before Asda, is making losses and the US giant seems unable to work out how to fix it. </p> <p>It has yet to make much impact in Britain either. There are constant tales of management disarray, supported by the recent departure of Allan Leighton, the former Asda chief executive. Its sales have not grown as expected and it seems not to have converted British consumers, weaned on special offers, to its American mantra of everyday low prices. </p> <p>Some believe Wal-Mart's troubles in Europe make a bid for Safeway more likely. 'It has to get on or get out,' said a supermarket executive. A bid for Safeway would still leave it behind Tesco in the pecking order but the extra scale should make its strategy easier to execute. </p> <p>Others, however, believe it will concentrate on sorting out Asda first and that, when it does turn to acquisitions again, Boots rather than Safeway will be the target. Wal-Mart understands that market better; its strength in the US is outside food. Most tellingly, Boots' wide margins and depressed share price make it easier both to acquire for a reasonable price, and to cut prices while maintaining decent profits. </p> <p>Tesco's concern about either of the Safeway combinations has led it to float the idea of a break-up bid for the group. That would suit it perfectly. Tesco could get its hands on some of its favourite Safeway sites, as well as preventing its rivals challenging its dominance. </p> <p>The prospect of Tesco securing agreement for such a deal is, however, remote. 'There are huge problems with a consortium bid,' said one analyst. 'There would have to be a lead bidder - who would take on that role? They could have to pay as much as \u00a35 billion - where would they raise that kind of money?' </p> <p>Most of the intrigue centres on a British deal, but that does not mean a foreign bid is ruled out. Indeed, some predict that Carrefour, the French retailer, will eschew the weaker players and bid for Tesco. But Tesco's shares have been rising, partly on the expectation of a favourable result from the competition inquiry. If Carrefour had been planning a bid, it would have made sense to move earlier. It has no British interests, so would have been unaffected by the inquiry. </p> <p>The only thing everyone agrees on is that there are too many food retailers for them all to make decent returns - even the Commission found no evidence of excessive profits. Consolidation is inevitable. Now the inquiry is over, how that will happen is about to become clear.</p>",
  "<p>If you were looking for the best way to make Britain's railways safer you would not start from here. Desperate efforts to improve safety and restore credibility in train travel a year after the Paddington disaster have uncovered a system racked with confusion and neglect. </p> <p>All the technological solutions currently on offer to stop trains shooting red signals are flawed, and the 1 billion passengers that use the network every year have been left without the fullest possible protection as wrangling continues. </p> <p>Tomorrow, Railtrack, which owns the lines, signalling and stations, will respond to a legal challenge by the train drivers' union Aslef calling on the company to scrap its plans to install an inferior safety system. Railtrack will tell the official inquiry investigating safety in the wake of Paddington, and the Southall crash of 1997, that it is pressing ahead with the project to install a non-computerised device called TPWS, with government backing. </p> <p>Britain already lags far behind its principal European neighbours with their state-of-the-art, high-speed, double-deck or tilting trains, newly-built lines, and automatic signalling and accident prevention systems. </p> <p>Successive UK governments and the rail industry have dragged their heels for so long that the computerised Automatic Train Protection (ATP) equipment they were expected to fit a decade ago is now out of date. </p> <p>Safety campaigners and the unions are at loggerheads with Railtrack, the train operators, the safety authorities and the Government. </p> <p>A new generation of technology called the European Train Control System (ETCS) is being furiously developed on the Continent and Britain is involved, but it is not yet ready to be installed. Railtrack and the engineering firm Alstom have been working on ETCS with Siemens of Germany, France's Alcatel, Italy's Ansaldo and various European Union national railway companies. The new system will be compatible across Europe but adapted to fit each national network. Many continental operators are busy signing up for it. </p> <p>Railtrack is poised to sign a \u00a31 billion contract with Alstom later this year for new signalling on the West Coast mainline that will provide new-generation train safety between London, the Midlands and Glasgow by 2005. </p> <p>But beyond the West Coast line there are currently no definite plans or a timetable to order this technology for the rest of the UK network or even just its mainlines. </p> <p>Robin Gisby, Railtrack's network development director, said: 'After West Coast, the East Coast [line] would be next. We are maybe looking at 2006/7, then Great Western, if they are [due for] the next big upgrades. </p> <p>'It is very difficult to build this new system into the existing patchwork of signalling.' </p> <p>Gisby said the company would 'think carefully' about possibly 'retro-fitting' the new system on the existing London-Brighton route or the Midland mainline, which runs via the East Midlands to Yorkshire, 'if we were not going to be upgrading them in the next couple of years'. </p> <p>Words like that prompt industry observers to warn it will be at least a decade before Britain has a decent high speed rail network with automatic safety systems. </p> <p>The Hidden Inquiry into the 1988 Clapham crash, which killed 35 people, recommended that ATP be fitted within five years to eliminate the high number of signals passed at danger (spads). The then Transport Secretary, Cecil Parkinson - a railwayman's son - promised the House of Commons in November 1989: 'Finance will not stand in the way of the implementation of the report.' He was backed by his Labour Shadow, John Prescott. </p> <p>But Parkinson, who called for speedy action, had moved to another job by the time his Conservative government colleagues and British Rail shelved the plans in 1994 - on financial grounds. </p> <p>They calculated that, with a \u00a3550 million price tag, ATP would cost up to \u00a314m for each potential life it saved. Investment on the railways is usually limited to \u00a32m per saved life. Safety spending on the roads, where more than 3,400 people are killed annually, is around \u00a3750,000 per life. </p> <p>While other EU states were modernising their railways in the Nineties, building new high-speed lines and fitting them with ATP, Britain limited its work to the Heathrow Express and the Channel Tunnel, and pushed through privatisation while the bulk of the network crumbled. </p> <p>Only limited ATP pilot schemes were ever introduced. Great Western notoriously had the system installed but not working, because of reliability problems, when its Swansea to London train went through a red light and smashed into a freight train at Southall, killing seven people. </p> <p>Carol Bell, who was injured and traumatised in that crash and is now a safety campaigner, is convinced that existing versions of ATP in use in Britain, other parts of Europe and the US should have been fitted throughout this country a long time ago - and still could be. She is supported by Mick Rix, general secretary of Aslef, which has launched the legal challenge to TPWS currently being aired at the inquiry. </p> <p>Bell is dismayed at the failure to fit ATP, compounded by the distinct lack of commitment to signing up for the new European system for the whole network. </p> <p>Campaigners dread that once TPWS is fitted, the industry will try to wriggle out of upgrading to the European system - even if the Cullen Inquiry into Paddington recommends it, European law encourages it and the Government provides cash towards the \u00a32bn cost. </p> <p>'The sad thing is that \"only\" seven people died at Southall and although 31 deaths at Paddington was dreadful, if it had been the 200 feared at one point then I think there would have been drastic action on safety systems by now,' said Bell. </p> <p>Louise Christian, the solicitor leading the legal battle for the victims of both crashes, said TPWS should be scrapped in order to ensure the most expedient installation of the new European systems. </p> <p>But Sir David Davies, whose report on safety written earlier this year for the Government and accepted by Prescott as Deputy Prime Minister, said: 'The European system for the whole country would take at least nine years to fit, and most people say 15. TPWS can save lives sooner.' </p> <p>Safety campaigners warn there will have to be another crash before the warring parties agree about the best solution, let alone implement it. </p> <p><strong>How the train protection systems compare</strong></p> <p><strong> Automatic Train Protection (ATP)</strong> </p> <p><strong> How it works</strong><br>Generic term for computer-based automatic system. </p> <p>UK version consists of electronic messages from signalling system sent via cables in track or lineside unit to computer on train. Computer tells driver maximum safe speed based on route, speed limits, red signal ahead, etc. If permitted speed is exceeded, brakes are applied automatically. </p> <p><strong> Up and running?</strong> <br>Some form of ATP operating in most EU states. UK has ATP on part of Great Western and Chiltern lines, Heathrow Express and Eurostar trains in Channel Tunnel. </p> <p><strong> Pros</strong><br>98 per cent prevention of accidents caused by signals passed at red. </p> <p><strong> Cons</strong><br>Existing ATP in UK cannot be upgraded to match forthcoming European systems. Difficult and expensive to<strong> </strong> fit to old trains, less reliable. Could take five-15 years. </p> <p><strong> Cost</strong><br>Estimated between \u00a3550 million and \u00a32 billion to fit whole network. </p> <p><strong> European Train Control System (ECTS)</strong> </p> <p><strong> How it works</strong><br>Three levels of fully automatic system linking signalling system to onboard computer. Level One overlays existing signals and transmits data to train giving full ATP up to 180mph. Level Two has improved radio communications capability. </p> <p>Level Three does away with lineside signal and data kit. Train controlled via secure, digital radio links. Line capacity increased as trains can run closer together. </p> <p><strong> Up and running?</strong> <br>Level two currently being fitted to Vienna-Budapest line. Planned for UK West Coast Line by 2005. Further testing planned in Switzerland, France, Italy, Germany and Spain. </p> <p><strong> Pros</strong><br>State of the art train protection and communications. Complies with new EU laws. </p> <p><strong> Cons</strong><br>Difficult to retro-fit, therefore usually installed only when lines upgraded. </p> <p><strong> Cost</strong><br>Estimated \u00a31.1billion-\u00a32bn. </p> <p><strong> Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS)</strong> </p> <p><strong> How it works</strong><br>Cable loops in track transmit radio signals to unit in driver's cab. Brakes are automatically applied if train shoots red signal or goes too fast through speed trap set in advance of signal. Enhances existing UK Automatic Warning System (AWS) that rings bell in cab for green signal, sounds horn for yellow or red, applying brakes if driver does not respond. </p> <p><strong> Up and running?</strong><br>Small-scale trials on part of Thameslink line since 1997. Plans to fit TPWS to all signals at junctions by the end of 2002, and to virtually all rolling stock by the end of 2003. Proposals to trial enhanced system for speeds up to 100mph. </p> <p><strong> Pros</strong><br>Quicker, easier and cheaper to fit than ATP. Reasonably reliable. </p> <p><strong> Cons</strong><br>Current system only effective up to 75mph. TPWS cannot be upgraded to meet new European standards. </p> <p><strong> Cost</strong><br>\u00a3330m</p>",
  "<p>Advisers to Tomkins, whose chief executive Greg Hutchings quit abruptly last week, are investigating potential breaches of the Companies Act by the crisis-torn conglomerate. </p> <p>The review centres on \u00a385,000 of donations by the group to the Greater London Forum, a think-tank set up by Lord Archer during his ill-fated bid to become Mayor of London. </p> <p>Hutchings, a friend of the disgraced Tory peer, acted as treasurer of the forum. The handouts - which included \u00a310,000 to Business for Sterling, the anti-euro group - reflected the dealmaker's treatment of Tomkins as his own personal fiefdom. </p> <p>Tomkins' other lavish bills, which shocked the City last week, included \u00a330,000 a year each to Hutchings' wife and housekeeper, \u00a340,000 to a charity run by his close friend Su Sayer, and huge expenses run up on private jets, a per onalised Rolls-Royce and luxury London apartments. </p> <p>In all, Tomkins made charitable donations worth \u00a32.5 million in the past three financial years, but declared no political gifts. Under company law, while charities need not be identified in annual reports, beneficiaries of political donations must be. Failure to do so is a criminal offence, punishable by fines on all board directors. </p> <p>This weekend Hutchings' spokesman, Nigel Whitaker, did not return calls from The Observer. Sources close to Archer insisted the Forum was carefully set up to be 'non-party-political'. </p> <p>It is not, however, a registered charity, and Archer was its president. Tomkins' advisers believe the donations were clearly political. None of the controversial payments were known to chairman David Newlands until last week, and none was authorised by the full Tomkins board, sources said. </p> <p>'The London Forum was clearly a front for Archer, and the undeclared donations look to have broken the Companies Act,' one Tomkins' source said. 'The auditors are now scouring the books to check whether everything has been properly recorded and declared.' </p> <p>This weekend, shareholders urged Tomkins to resist any payoff for Hutchings, who earned \u00a31.45m last year. The group's lawyers will also press him to repay his lavish personal expenses once the final bill is known. </p> <p>The Stock Exchange, meanwhile, has contacted Tomkins' brokers, Cazenove and UBS Warburg, and may pass findings from the internal inquiry to the Department of Trade and Industry, regulatory sources said. </p> <p>Hutchings, 53, built up Tomkins from a tiny shell in 1983 into a vast Anglo-US conglomerate, spanning engineering, Smith &amp; Wesson handguns, bicycles and lawnmowers. But the City's love affair with the group ended with Tomkins' \u00a3950m purchase of Rank Hovis McDougall, the baker, in 1992. RHM was finally sold earlier this year. </p> <p>Hutchings' resignation has sparked calls for the group to be broken up. But this weekend Tomkins' biggest City investor, Hermes, called for no knee-jerk reactions. </p> <p>'We welcome the decision to conduct a strategic review,' said Hermes corporate focus director Peter Butler. 'We realise this may take time, and there are other options than an immediate break-up.'</p>",
  "<p>Oil shocks, crisis in the Middle East, exchange rates all over the place. It is all disturbingly reminiscent of the early 1970s. Stock market 'correction', flight to 'quality' in the bond market - it is also evocative of the panic of autumn 1998. That was when, after the Russian debt default, the wonderfully sophisticated financial markets 'dried up' (in the words of one US banker) and the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund had to be rescued at the behest of the US Federal Reserve. </p> <p>LTCM was run by Nobel prize-winners. Hedge funds are meant to be the most intelligent of investment managers. Ever since the rescue of LTCM - it simply could not be allowed to go under - and the Federal Reserve's successful easing of monetary policy, the system has kept going, but hardly a day goes by somewhere without official meetings aimed at improving the world's 'financial architecture'. </p> <p>Mighty efforts are being put into improving banking and general financial supervision, and the emphasis among International Monetary Fund economists has shifted from the arcane world of monetary theory to spotting potential financial crises. Yet officials express much private and some public frustration with the slow pace of improvement in the financial architecture. </p> <p>And, for all the emphasis on 'transparency' in economic and financial policy, the Group of Seven leading industrial countries has spent a lot of time hoping the most transparent problem of all - the vast trade deficit and mounting indebtedness of the United States, will simply blow away. </p> <p>Much of the debate about financial architecture calls to mind the application of a lick of paint while the house is being rocked to its foundations. There is something wrong, as former US Fed Chairman Paul Volcker has pointed out, with a world in which two of the three leading currencies - the dollar and the yen - can move by 50 per cent in value against each other in a period of two years. </p> <p>There is also something deeply disturbing about the way for a long time the world's monetary authorities seemed to treat the decline in the euro against the dollar, or the rise in the dollar against the euro, with insouciance. </p> <p>And there was something wrong with the main explanation being trotted out for this latter phenomenon - namely the strength of the US economy vis-\u00e0-vis the European. (The dollar has not been strong against the yen, and the Japanese economy has hardly been noted for its strength in recent years.) </p> <p>The first sign of hope that the G7 was taking international economic and financial imbalances seriously was when it intervened to stabilise the euro on the way to its recent meeting in Prague. The official communique stated that this was done 'at the initiative of the European Central Bank' and, technically, it was. But the US Federal Reserve had been worried about currency instability for some time. The Fed had to wait for the Europeans to get their act together. It also had to persuade the senior echelons of the US Treasury, because it is the Treasury that controls exchange market intervention policy in the US. </p> <p>Now, one of the reasons for the existence of the euro is that European statesmen in the 1970s wanted a 'zone of monetary stability' in Europe; this was against the background of the world financial instability that followed the break-up of the post-war Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system and the 1973-74 oil crisis. </p> <p>Whether we have statesmen or mere politicians these days is an open question. You would have thought that Ministers might have been worried about the exchange rate gyrations in recent years. On 5 October, Willem Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, reminded us that at the European Summit of December 1997 the Council of Ministers 'decided and made it public that so-called general orientations [for exchange rate policy] would only be issued in very exceptional circumstances'. Duisenberg added: 'Well, such exceptional circumstances have not arisen.' </p> <p>So the ECB's intervention was decided by the ECB's governing council (its board plus central bank governors) whereas the Fed needed the US Treasury's approval. The ECB explains most of its decisions in relation to its goal of price stability, and, in his speech to the European Business School London last week Duisenberg said the recent intervention showed the ECB took concern about price stability 'very seriously and are ready to back up our words with deeds'. </p> <p>Nevertheless, even the ECB was prepared to sign up to the G7 statement indicating that the intervention was not just about European price stability but reflected 'shared concern of Finance Ministers and Governors about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy'. </p> <p>This point was emphasised last week by Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, in another London lecture, given under the auspices of South Bank University's Journal of Common Market Studies. Trichet said: 'The success of the euro will yield a decisive contribution to an appropriate economic and monetary equilibrium in the world' and emphasised that the US, Japan and Europe were all 'vulnerable to a rather similar degree to adverse shocks occurring in the international financial system'. </p> <p>I am a great admirer of Trichet, and hope these remarks foreshadow rather greater leadership and sensitivity towards the world's economic imbalances than we have so far seen from the Euro X1. Buried in many a speech by the Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is the acknowledgement that, productivity miracle or not, the mounting US trade deficit could end in tears. </p> <p>The present signs of turmoil in world markets should be followed in due course by recognition of the urgent need for the G7 to build on recent intervention and work on currency stabilisation agreements, as it did in the mid-1980s. There may be a zone of monetary stability in Europe (the UK excluded), but we need target zones to limit the wild currency fluctuations around the world, and shore up that financial architecture.</p>",
  "<b> The Turk in Italy</b> ENO, Coliseum, London WC2 <br> <b> BCMG</b> Barbican, London EC2 <br> <b> London Sinfonietta</b> Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 <p> At the risk of stating the obvious, if you stage an opera as if it were a film, the music implicitly takes on the role of soundtrack. This not overly profound thought fluttered like a red flag of warning throughout English National Opera's new version of <b> The Turk in Italy </b> and insistently remained unfurled. In the overture, a flurry of cinematic business, cigarette smoking and film clips grabbed our attention, providing a visual, rather than a musical trailer for what was to follow. All the bustle acted as a foil to some of the extraneous sounds coming from the pit but this cannot have been the prime aim. </p> <p>Rossini's youthful comedy tells the story, roughly speaking, of a poet who draws his subject matter from life as observed in the flirtations, squabbles and intrigues of a Turkish prince and the pair of women who lust after him. In David Fielding's production, the original Naples gypsy camp has been replaced by a film studio for a Fellini-esque drama. The poet has become a director and the two women a composite of Sophia Loren, Anita Ekberg, Marilyn Monroe and Ava Gardner (a challenge indeed but bravely attempted). With this clever conceit, Kit Hesketh-Harvey has thus created a fresh storyline for one of Rossini's lesser known works, chosen to represent the composer in ENO's current Italian Season. The translation delighted in far-fetched rhymes (phosphorus and Bosphorus, haberdasher and Pasha) and earned well-deserved laughter. </p> <p>The most conspicuous element of Stefanos Lazaridis's set (designed to serve the whole season) remains the scaffolding, first introduced in Manon Lescaut . Here, less clatteringly, it acts as a gallery for the chorus and as a vantage point for Thomas Allen, skilful and omnipresent as the poet-director Prosdocimo. His experienced presence gave the production necessary polish. The programme book contains an extract from Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of An Author, making a familiar link between the Italian dramatist and his operatic predecessor. Their shared fascination with life's absurd illusions connects with Fellini's self-reflexive world and the slice of Cinecitt\u00e0 presented here. </p> <p>The difficulty came in the second act, when the repeated gag and Rossini's music wear a little thin. Despite some typically complicated ensembles which end up with everyone suitably confounded and dumbfounded, the score lacks the comedic brilliance of The Barber of Seville. The slightly ragged first night performance did not help. Donald Maxwell put his usual zest into the role of Geronio, the cuckolded husband. Judith Howarth as Fiorilla had splendid edge and presence. As her rival Zaida, Victoria Simmonds began nervously but settled into her part. Jeremy White sang the bass role of Selim the Turk with agility and warm humour. The chorus was crisp and David Parry, conducting, kept the rapid ensembles just under control. But the orchestral playing was disappointingly woolly, as too often of late. ENO's building programme promises essential renewal for Frank Matcham's 1904 theatre. Equally pressing is the need to restore the Coliseum orchestra to its old sparkle and pep. But 8 out of 10 would be a generous mark for the evening as a whole. </p> <p>Precision has always been a defining feature of <b> Birmingham Contemporary Music Group</b>, one of the best ensembles of its kind, especially when conducted by Simon Rattle. Last week they gave the world premiere (repeated tomorrow in Birmingham) of a commission by Colin Matthews, Continuum for mezzo-soprano and large chamber ensemble. A setting of two poems by Eugenio Montale with instrumental interludes, it matches the scale of a symphony or cantata, yet resembles neither. Not surprisingly for a composer who has worked on Mahler's incomplete Tenth Symphony, Matthews can handle grandeur and intimacy with equal skill. His scoring is limpid yet mysterious, qualities fully brought out by Rattle, BCMG and the soloist Cynthia Clarey. In the first poem, a dense exploration of memory, death and hope, low woodwind flutter and throb softly while harp, percussion and strings move with sensuous restraint, each layer or interruption perfectly placed. This darkling soundworld bursts free only in the orchestral interludes, the last of which gathers swirling, bright momentum. </p> <p>A breathtaking performance of Ligeti's Piano Concerto by Pierre-Laurent Aimard revealed this playful, percussive and perilous work in all its facets, brilliantly aided by Rattle's cogent direction. BCMG also gave the UK premiere of Krasa's Symphony for Small Orchestra, written in 1923, long before the Czech composer was interned at Terezin, eventually dying in Auschwitz in 1944. This short, sardonic work, scored with exacting delicacy, encompasses caf\u00e9, cabaret and dance music and a dry, military march. The third movement is a microscopically detailed setting for mezzo of Rimbaud's poem about picking lice from children's hair, only too authentic an account for those of us who regularly indulge in this modish middle-class pastime. </p> <p>John Tavener, whose radiant visions in sound possess not a single scratchy or abrasive noise, is being celebrated in an extensive series entitled Ikons of Light. A <b> London Sinfonietta</b> Festival Hall concert included Stravinsky's stark Canticum Sacrum, the work which inspired Tavener to become a composer, and his own Protecting Veil, which enjoyed cult status in the Nineties, tapping a new and still active hunger for contemplative music. The cello soloist was Raphael Wallfisch, making an ardent case for this meditation on the Virgin Mary. </p> <p>Tavener detests art music as the work of the devil and wants his compositions to be judged only as prayer. Even a new music audience at the South Bank is steeped in sin (and presumably the composer accepts his sullied fee). In art as in lice, itches have their place and scratches bring relief. Without them we cannot discern our position on Tavener's ladder of spiritual perfection.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The House of Mirth </strong> (140 mins, PG) Directed by Terence Davies; starring Gillian Anderson, Eric Stoltz, Dan Aykroyd, Anthony LaPaglia </p> <p>In 1937, the year Edith Wharton died aged 75, her work was consigned to oblivion by the left-wing critic, Herbert J. Muller, in his Modern Fiction: a Study in Values. He conceded that in The House of Mirth she 'made what in its day [1905] seemed a daringly realistic study of high society'. But after finding a few words of praise for Ethan Frome, her single excursion into working-class life, Muller declared that 'the bulk of her work concerns the doings of pallid gentlefolk and soon acquires the mustiness that has already sent The House of Mirth to the attic'. </p> <p>Well, Wharton and her books have long been recovered from the attic and the two most famous of them have been filmed with great distinction by Martin Scorsese and Terence Davies, blue-collar Catholics far removed from the patrician, Wasp world of Edith Wharton. Both have seen in her books the subtle perception and unflinching honesty of a writer who, from a position of confident success and social acceptance, could observe the hypocrisy, false values and cruelty of her own class. To write trenchantly, vividly on one society is to illuminate the idea of society in general. </p> <p>As he's demonstrated in the movies inspired by his Liverpool childhood and the non-autobiographical Neon Bible, Davies has a tragic, or at least stoical, view of life, and it was clearly not to escape from his customary gloom that he chose to film The House of Mirth. </p> <p>The title, which misleadingly suggests a funfair attraction, comes from Ecclesiastes ('The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; the heart of fools is in the house of mirth') and Edith Wharton regretted having adapted her first major literary success for the stage. 'I now doubt if that kind of a play, with a \"sad\" ending and a negative hero, could ever get a hearing from an American audience,' she wrote during its very brief Broadway run. In consoling her as they left the theatre, the critic and novelist William Dean Howells famously remarked: 'What the American public always wants is a tragedy with a happy ending.' </p> <p>The 29-year-old Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) follows on from Emma Bovary, Anna Karenina and Isobel Archer in the nineteenth-century tradition of self-deceiving heroines destroyed through a combination of oppressive social conventions and their own wilfulness. Lily is a 29-year-old orphan, beautiful, intelligent, witty, but dependent upon an allowance from a rich aunt and expected to secure her place in upper-class New York through marrying a rich man. </p> <p>This is a society in transition (old money is being challenged, or inveigled, by the nouveaux riches ) that plays a deadly game with complex, unwritten rules which have nothing to do with ethics or morality. The consequences for losers are ostracism and banishment. </p> <p>Following Wharton's book with intelligent fidelity, the film goes to the heart of the matter with a superb opening encounter between Lily and her confidant, Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz), a hard-working lawyer with no inherited money. Like her, he lives through the hospitality of the rich. They love each other, but her ambition and his diffidence keep them apart. This lean sequence, which establishes character, milieu and values, concludes with Lily leaving Selden's apartment block and lying to its owner, the suave financier Rosedale (Anthony LaPaglia), that she's been seeing her dressmaker. </p> <p>This is the first of several hostages to fortune. As Davies forgoes an authorial commentary (one of the strengths of Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence, where Joanne Woodward spoke for Wharton), we are not told that Rosedale is a Jew. Viewers who haven't read the book may think him merely an edgily ambitious arriviste and not be aware that Lily shares the conventional anti-Semitism of her class. </p> <p>Though both Lily and Selden see through, and wittily mock, this society, they're trapped within it, in Lily's case because she lacks the skills and the political vision to break away. Ultimately, she's brought down and sent to an early grave by her decency, her vulnerability and her honesty. She rejects several wealthy suitors, falls into the hands of the blackmailing would-be seducer, Gus Trenor (Dan Aykroyd), is manipulated by a treacherous friend, the adulterous Bertha Dorset (Laura Linney) and cheated by a hypocritical cousin, (Jodhi May). </p> <p>To tell this complex story, Davies steers a course somewhere between the luxurious explicitness of Merchant-Ivory - whose admirable, not dissimilar, The Golden Bowl opens next month - and the metaphoric, elliptical, expressionist style of his previous pictures. The action proceeds through a succession of dialogues where, except in the exchanges between Lily and Selden, the real subject under discussion only occasionally disrupts the polite surface. The truth is to be found in glances and a shift in the eyes, and his whole cast serve Davies admirably. </p> <p>The movie draws for its visual style on the contemporary paintings of John Singer Sargent and James Tissot (whose work is used for the covers of several Virago editions of Wharton), but Davies, who shot all the American material on artfully dressed Scottish locations, doesn't parade the period detail. The decor is always in the background. </p> <p>The eclectic use of music is typical of Davies, but the most obviously characteristic sequence is a transition from the States to the Mediterranean where Lily is to be undone. It begins with a series of tracking shots though the dust-sheet-covered furniture of a mansion, followed by the camera moving rapidly over a rain-splattered lake that gives way to the sun catching smooth, sun-dappled water as the prow of a yacht breaks through the sea, and finally the camera pans up to buildings on the cliffs of Monte Carlo. An episode to cherish.</p>",
  "Do you know what a PNA is - or a 'pre-nup'? The chirpy abbreviation is, no doubt, an attempt to make pre-nuptial agreements seem palatable. 'Pre-nups' sound like nibbles before dinner and that, in a sense, is exactly what they are: a taste of the meal to come. They are for people whose marriages are made not in heaven but in a lawyer's office. <p>For Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones, it is all settled: the wedding invitations are out, the baby, Dylan, is out too, and the wrangling over the pre-nuptial agreement is concluded. Should the couple divorce, Jones will gain at least \u00a31 million for every year of marriage. And to show that Douglas (worth \u00a3150m) and his bride are not mercenary, there will be no wedding presents. Guests will, instead, be encouraged to make out cheques to a charitable trust in Dylan's name so that he may learn about the 'joys of giving'. It could be argued that what Dylan is actually about to learn from his parents is quite different - it's about holding on to what you have. </p> <p>Pre-nuptial agreements have been popular in Hollywood for the past decade (think of Michael Jackson and Debbie Rowe, Donald Trump and Ivana, Ted Turner and Jane Fonda). But it is not only Hollywood that is becoming more grasping - or cautious (depending upon your point of view). And in Britain, which has the highest divorce rate in Europe, it should not come as a surprise that pre-nuptial agreements are becoming increasingly common. They tend to involve wealthy people or those getting married for a second time (once bitten, twice tight). </p> <p>According to James Harcus, a family partner at the law firm Withers, it would make sense even for those who marry without much money (they may, after all, earn handsomely later on) to think about drawing up a pre-nuptial agreement. 'England is the only country in the civilised world where pre-nuptial agreements are not legally binding,' Harcus points out. This would have changed if New Labour had had its way. Its consultation paper 'Supporting Families' (1998) expressed concern about divorce and the enormous legal costs involved and welcomed pre-nuptial agreements, as sensible pre-emptive measures, recommending that they be recognised by the courts. </p> <p>The recommendation has since been thrown out by the judiciary. According to Harcus, British courts tend not to respect pre-nuptial agreements, often awarding wives more than their husbands bargained for. Could this be an expression of moral disapprobation? 'That is my impression,' said Harcus. </p> <p>To form a pre-nuptial agreement, a couple may not seek advice from the same lawyer: each is separately represented. It is, from the first, an adversarial situation. Harcus admits that he knows of cases where the marriage had to be called off because of the hostilities involved or because 'it took such a long time to complete the process that the couple's ardour cooled'. </p> <p> Is the court right to disapprove of pre-nuptials? Are they really so morally objectionable? Gina White, who has recently married, thinks they suggest 'divorce in miniature. Or making a will - it is like planning the death of your marriage. But the difference is that all lives end, while only some marriages do.' So why the growing impulse to draw up such agreements? 'I think people are twisting the idea of a compensation culture, trying to compensate themselves for an unhappy marriage before it has even happened.' She adds: 'They want a safety net before there is any danger. I think it is a control freak impulse. I think we live in a society tormented by the wish to predict the unpredictable, manage the uncontrollable. </p> <p>'Perhaps God's low profile is to blame. Everyone knows that control freaks are running scared, trying to contain their own chaos.' </p> <p>Pre-nuptial agreements imply ungenerous provision. The generous optimist would never be drawn to such a contract. Or would they? A recent NOP poll claimed that a quarter of the population is in favour of pre-nuptial agreements (I wasn't consulted, were you?). It also maintained that Londoners were especially cautious lovers. But of the Londoners I spoke to not one sounded cautious, even in retrospect. </p> <p>Jamie Roberts, who was divorced after 13 years of marriage and now supports two families has no retrospective yearning for an advantageous pre-nuptial settlement, even though he is no longer the wealthy man he once was. 'When I first married I would never have compromised my feelings by considering such an agreement, because of the implication: this is not going to last, this is not made for us, this marriage is made for the law. The grinning skull of the law would have disfigured the face of my marriage.' Roberts admits, though, that his father used to warn him: 'Beware of fortune hunters. Remember Kashoggi!' </p> <p>Annabel Harris is not married yet, but believes that before she marries she will have to make 'the hardest pre-nuptial agreement of all: the decision to live together'. She thinks that any further agreement suggests you are in doubt about each other. 'A pre-nuptial agreement is like taking out buildings insurance; you are treating your marriage shabbily, as if it were a leaky, vulnerable house. Marriage ought to aim high - otherwise why bother?' </p> <p>Sheila Sullivan, author of Falling in Love - a History of Torment and Enchantment, has studied love in many of its manifestations throughout history. Does she think that pre-nuptial agreements are antipathetic to the state of being in love? Her answer is surprising. She concedes that couples madly in love would not be able to 'conceive of love ending' and would find all thoughts of money 'sordid' (to the extent that if one of them were to raise the idea of a pre-nuptial agreement, the relationship would probably founder). </p> <p>But she goes on to say that 'couples in a cooler, more rational frame of mind (in love - but not madly so) might be able to take a more realistic view of the future of their relationship, and would probably not be damaged by sensible thoughts about money or future separation.' And she adds, 'Perhaps they could laugh about it, while the romantics would only cry.' </p> <p>It is clear that for some couples, the pre-nup is a settler for pre-marriage nerves, a kind of legal Alka-Seltzer. There are extreme cases of pre-nup tension on record. Teresa and Rex Levalley from New Mexico made their legal agreement include guidelines on sex (3-4 times a week), conversation (at least 15-30 minutes a day), and driving (the tank must never be less than half full). How soon, one wonders, will it be before their marriage is running on empty? </p> <p>For those wanting a more straightforward pre-nup, it is now possible to buy a document on-line for \u00a329.99 - an idea introduced by <a href=\"http://www.desktoplawyer.net\" target=\"_NEW\">www.desktoplawyer.net</a> last Valentine's Day. The site cautions consumers that pre-nups are 'not enforceable in the courts of England and Wales'. It should also warn that pre-nuptial agreements may be totally overthrown by the arrival of children. </p> <p>Donald Wright, the Edinburgh-based lawyer who set up www. divorce.co.uk thinks the active promotion of pre-nups online 'foolhardy'. But he does not rule out such agreements entirely. 'Everyone is different.' One of his clients, divorcing for the second time, earns in excess of \u00a3200,000 a year - and would, in Wright's view, have been better off in every sense with a pre-nuptial agreement. </p> <p>Marriage is about sharing spoils; pre-nuptials are about dividing them (and 'spoils' seems just the right word). Of course it makes sense to think before you marry - and for some the planning will extend to a pre-nuptial agreement. But for Jamie Roberts and others like him pre-nups will never catch on. 'They put a red line through the marriage vow itself: \"And with all my worldly goods I thee endow\".' </p> <p> Some names in this article have been changed</p>",
  "<p>Win the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture at the right point in your career, and it's a triumph. Get it too late, and it's a heavy hint that the time has come to shuffle off the stage to make way for another generation. When Jorn Utzon won the award for the Sydney Opera House in 1980, he said: 'If you like an architect's work, you give him something to build, not a medal.' After Le Corbusier got the medal he went back to Maxwell Fry's house and, according to Charles Jencks's new biography, drank himself under the table, accompanied by a beautiful female companion. </p> <p>If there is one architect who has managed to design a landmark building with the same popular power as Utzon's opera house, it is Frank Gehry, who will be collecting the gold medal at the banqueting house in Whitehall on Wednesday. But Gehry can afford to take a more relaxed view than Utzon, and a more sober one than Le Corbusier. He was a late starter, toiling away in big commercial practices that specialised in shopping centres, and struggling for years on his own, before designing the Guggenheim in Bilbao. And that was only the beginning of Gehry's career as a mainstream figure. At 71 he has never been busier. He is building a new concert hall in Los Angeles. He has designed a new Guggenheim museum in Manhattan twice the size of his Bilbao outpost, and was in the running to build a skyscraper for the New York Times incorporating a 10-storey base decorated with giant fragments of the newspaper's masthead. 'It would have been a great building, but I pulled out. I could see that I wasn't going to be able to work with the Times's developers without a fight and I am getting too tired at my age to fight. Most people at my stage look for the bigger projects, I've gone the other way.' In Berlin he has just completed a spectacular bank, and there are projects in Brazil, Panama, Germany, the Czech Republic and the UK - the latter being an innovative cancer counselling centre built in memory of his friend, Maggie Jencks. </p> <p>Architects have traditionally enjoyed long careers - Frank Lloyd Wright completed the first great Guggenheim building when was 90. But Gehry is aware of the need to use the time he has left effectively. He is probably the most famous architect in the world, which means he is inundated with projects large and small from every ambitious city, manufacturer and retailer desperate for a piece of the Bilbao glamour. Paul Allen, Bill Gates's one-time partner at Microsoft, indulged his passion for Jimi Hendrix by having Gehry design the $240 million Experience Music Project in Seattle. </p> <p>Gehry, who has the rumpled affability of a Californian Woody Allen, makes an unlikely architectural guru. He is blessed with a self-deprecating irony of a kind not usually associated with American architects. Nor does he show any interest in the opaque language of structuralism that plagues so much contemporary industry discussion. He is allergic to corporate practice. Gehry is a shirt-sleeves kind of a guy, at his happiest messing around in a workshop with a blunt pencil and some yellow drafting paper. He used to make cardboard furniture with his own hands. And he spent a lot of time hanging out with artists such as Claes Oldenburg. They worked together on the offices of an advertising agency in Los Angeles, and came up with a design that incorporated a five- storey (habitable) pair of Oldenburg binoculars in the heart of the building. Subsequently, Gehry began to treat all architecture as art. He developed an obsession with fish imagery, building a restaurant in Japan in the shape of a giant carp, and creating a fish out of steel mesh on the Barcelona waterfront. He has an artist's wariness of offering too many apologies for his work. Why make a building look like a fish? 'Oh I don't know, I just kind of liked it.' </p> <p>Gehry was born in Canada, moving to Los Angeles with his family when still very young. He is the most considerable architectural talent to emerge from the city since Charles Eames in the 1950s, and the first to have evolved an architecture from the context of LA, rather than importing it from somewhere else. With its seemingly random collisions of shapes, and odd juxtapositions, Gehry's architecture accepts its context. When you are surrounded by freeways, giant advertising signs, and drive-in restaurants in the shape of giant bowler hats, or hot dogs, there is not much point trying to build chaste, well-mannered European style buildings. But if Gehry was uncrowned architect laureate of Los Angeles, it clearly rankled that he didn't get the prize commissions. Isozaki designed MoCA, the Getty went to Richard Meier. </p> <p>Gehry was beaten in the competition to design a cathedral for Los Angeles by Rafael Moneo. And when Gehry finally did get a plum project in his home town - the Disney concert hall - construction stopped almost as soon as the foundations had been dug, when the trustees ran out of money. It has only recently got back on track. </p> <p>Bilbao catapulted Gehry into another phase of his career, beyond the limits of Los Angeles. It was a sensation because it looked nothing like an art gallery, or for that matter, nothing like a piece of architecture at all. With its puckered titanium skinned roof, the Guggenheim was more like a train crash than a building, a home-made mutant version of the Sydney Opera House. Shock value of course is subject to the law of diminishing returns. The difficult question for Gehry is what happens when the Guggenheim becomes, as it soon will, the conventional signal for a museum. Gehry was both fortunate, and cursed to have hit the jackpot with the Guggenheim, a building single handedly credited with transforming Bilbao from terrorist-ridden industrial wasteland into a cultural pilgrimage site. It made him famous, but his work suddenly got out of sequence. He should have completed the Disney Hall first, which would have seemed like a logical curtain raiser for the Guggenheim. But because of the construction delays, the Guggenheim shot ahead. And when Disney Hall is completed in 2003 it runs the risk of having already been upstaged. </p> <p>Bilbao was a bolt from the blue, the last monument of the twentieth century, and one which was based on an exploration of forms that would never have been possible in any previous period. Gehry was able to build it thanks to a computer drafting system originally devised to design military aircraft that has already been superseded by faster, more powerful software. </p> <p>Looking at the Guggenheim now, just three years after it opened, it is clear that architecture has been sucked into the era of the computer upgrade. Gehry was the first to grasp the extraordinary liberating capacity for architectural geometry offered by new technology. But already the Guggenheim has that black-and-white, early-personal computer feel rather than the slick, seamless i-Book. But Gehry still has the potential to surprise us with yet another leap forward - and that is why he deserves the medal.</p>",

My ex-husband would beg me to help him shed a few pounds and then obstruct me at every turn. </p> <p>As with any addiction, when the activity is pleasurable, the habit is resistant to change. Love and eating are intimately bound together, and so the person most able to help him is someone with whom he has no emotional ties. Some people comfort-eat, as an antidote to stress or under-achievement. </p> <p>There are some practical things you can do. You may have been feeding him food that is too rich for his energy expenditure. You can certainly control calorie intake in the house by simply providing only healthy foods. </p> <p>Then if you need to get him to take more exercise, you may need to entice him along. I first got my man on horseback after a couple of whiskies and a reminder of his childhood ambition to be a cavalry officer. Choose an activity you can enjoy together, and one that gives social contacts. </p> <p>As you value your man and your marriage, think carefully before you resort to threats and ultimatums. Such tactics can seriously undermine his love and trust. </p> <p>Recently married men often do put on a lot of weight, and if all that is needed is a lifestyle adjustment, that is achievable. If it is a compensatory mechanism, and more resistant to change, you may just have to accept him as he is. </p> <p><b>Readers' responses</b> </p> <p>Being overweight is a gen eral problem that cannot be solved by an ultimatum. Maybe you should change your cooking and think about the family's lifestyle. You could also try to encourage him to do sports. </p> <p>Many people stop caring about their appearance when they get married. Have you changed as well? I think you should discuss with your partner the cause of the problem. You should start to do things you did before your marriage (candlelit dinner, go to a concert, have a moonlight walk). Never stop trying to attract each other.<br> H, A and J, Newcastle-upon-Tyne </p> <p><b> Next week's problem is from J.G. of Edinburgh</b> </p> <p> After years of following my husband's career, I began a career of my own, and have built a good reputation as an artist, although this doesn't produce a living wage. My husband states that he is delighted by my success, but is keen that all the household chores should still fall to me, even when I am struggling to meet a work deadline. As he is the breadwinner, and I work from home, I can see his logic, but I feel that he regards me more as his mother than as his wife. His sex drive has always been lower than mine, but now we only make love once every few months. He hides pornography around the house and is definitely not impotent. </p> <p>We have no children (by mutual agreement), and I wonder about leaving, although it would be very difficult for me financially. We get on well but at the age of 35 I am not ready to have my sexuality 'retired' by someone else. You will have guessed that he doesn't want to talk about this. Is sexual incompatibility a genuine reason for divorce?</p>",
  "<p>Dang Ha is Vietnam's answer to 'the man from the Pru'. She earns about \u00a3255 a month training Prudential Vietnam's 2,500 agents about the firm's products, ethics and, crucially, how to clinch a sale. </p> <p> She is benefiting directly from Vietnam's emergence as a new market economy. The country's communist rulers recently opened the first share trading centre in Ho Chi Minh City, giving people for the first time the opportunity to invest in the shares of just four former state-owned companies. </p> <p> The Prudential is one of the first Western financial companies to set up business in Vietnam, selling traditional life insurance products. </p> <p> The job has made a big difference to her lifestyle. Previously Dang worked as sales manager of the Meritus-Westlake Hotel, an international five-star hotel in Hanoi. The job was responsible, but paid only around \u00a3195 a month. With this, she had to pay towards her own direct family's upkeep and that of her mother, sister and sister-in-law. </p> <p> 'My brother-in-law unfortunately passed away one year ago and left behind my sister and five kids,' she says. 'My sister is only a farmer and it's very difficult for her to take care of the kids on her own. My sister-in-law is suffering from cancer and needs money for medication. Therefore I need to work even harder. </p> <p> 'Before joining Prudential, I could only support my family and my dependants for day-to-day living. Now I can save money, too.' </p> <p> Dang lives in Hanoi with her husband and two children, in a small, 50 square metre house that the couple bought before they were married for about 100 million Vietnam dong (approximately \u00a34,900. Her husband, Nguyen Van Sinh, graduated from Hanoi Uni versity and has worked for the Vietnam Science and Social Institute for the past five years, earning\u00a328 a month. He has just resigned to join the Pru as an agent. </p> <p> Dang Ha considers herself very fortunate to have a separate home for her family: 'In Vietnam, when a girl gets married, she will move out and live together with her husband's family. I am a lucky woman as my husband bought a private house so that we do not live with my parents-in-law.' </p> <p> Food costs are comparatively low - rice is cheap and chicken costs about \u00a31.77 per kilo - but household bills such as gas and electricity are approximately \u00a340 a month. </p> <p> Bikes are still the main mode of transport (Dang's parents, who retired eight years ago, now repair bikes to help make ends meet) and she travels to work on a 'company' motorbike. </p> <p> However, the couple have chosen to educate their children, five-year-old Nguyen Ha Vy, and three-year old Nguyen Hoang Son, privately, at a cost of \u00a350 a month. They have rejected the idea of buying such things as televisions and cameras, usually the first sign of increasing wealth in a developing economy. Instead they have managed to store about \u00a31,300 in cash in a bank. </p> <p> Dang says: 'Once my children finish school, I would like to use my spare money for helping them to build their own lives - finding a job, buying a house and getting married.'</p>",

  "<p>If they're not dropped down toilets, eaten by animals or had drinks spilt over them in pubs, one is stolen every three minutes. What are they? Mobile phones. </p> <p>Since you may have to pay up to \u00a3200 to replace a lost or damaged handset, taking out insurance to cover such an eventuality would seem sensible. But choosing mobile phone insurance can be almost as bewildering as choosing a network or handset. Where can you find the best deals? </p> <p>A survey by retailer Mobile Phone Centre (MPC) has found that accidents involving loos, beer and our four-legged friends are among the most common reasons for claims, accounting for 21 per cent of them. </p> <p>Incidents that MPC has come across include a phone devoured by a pig, another buried in the back garden by a pet dog and one falling from a bar into the slops tray. </p> <p>But it's not just accidents that leave mobile phone users - now more than 70 per cent of the population - with the inconvenience of managing without a phone and the cost of a replacement, which can be as much as five to 10 times the original price of the handset. </p> <p>Around 15,000 mobile phones are stolen every month in Britain and the number is growing. Theft accounted for 51 per cent of claims on the MPC scheme in 1999. </p> <p>But don't take the first insurance deal that is offered. Price and terms vary. Handset manufacturer Nokia recommends that you check what the networks or home insurers are offering. Network One 2 One spokeswoman Liza Hoeksma says: 'Look around. Sometimes the insurance is packaged into the deal or there may be a special offer of free insurance for a year. But we do recommend you take some insurance out. Phones are so easy to lose - people carry them around in their top pockets for instance - and replacing them can cost as much as \u00a3200.' </p> <p>Insurance can be bought from the networks directly or through the shops that sell the phones. Handset manufacturers do not offer insurance. Network Vodafone offers 'comprehensive' cover at \u00a35.95 a month for contract phones. You have to stump up a \u00a325 policy excess yourself when you make a claim. One 2 One's insurance is \u00a33.99 a month with a policy excess of \u00a320. Orange offers insurance at \u00a35 a month, again with a policy excess of \u00a320. The other big network, BT Cellnet, says it does not offer a scheme. </p> <p>Given that Orange will replace your handset for \u00a350, you may not think it is worthwhile taking out the insurance. But the company argues: 'If you take out the emergency care insurance once you have lost your phone you pay out \u00a320 for a new phone and \u00a330 pays for six months' insurance, all for the equivalent of your \u00a350.' </p> <p>Paying for accidental damage out of your own pocket can also be costly. If you drop your phone and crack the screen you will have to pay \u00a380 without insurance according to retailer Carphone Warehouse. </p> <p>Network insurance deals can tie you in for a year but Carphone Warehouse sells the insurance in three-month blocks after finding that most people lose their phones in the first six months because they are not used to having them. </p> <p>The price of Carphone Warehouse insurance depends on what type of phone you have and the level of cover. Its insurance for contract phones will set you back between \u00a389 and \u00a3107 annually while cover for pre-paid phones costs \u00a330 a year. Rival retailer MPC offers a deal through Cornhill which works out at \u00a360 a year. </p> <p>With all policies check what is not covered as well as what is. Loss is often excluded from policies meaning you will not get a payout if your phone is stolen because you leave it unattended on a bar. General wear and tear will probably not be covered. </p> <p>For theft to form the basis of a claim it may have to involve force. Remember all instances of theft or loss should be reported to the police and to the airtime provider. You won't get anywhere with your claim without a crime number. </p> <p>It is worth investigating whether mobile phones are covered by any household or motor insurance you already have. Norwich Union says mobiles may be covered under both the contents or personal belongings section of its household insurance as long as they are for personal use only. There is also a policy excess of \u00a350. </p> <p>Fewer than 30 per cent of mobile phones are insured, according to Carphone Warehouse. However, since the cost of replacing or repairing them is so high and problems so frequent, it is worth considering - provided you ask the right questions.</p>",

At the moment he is getting off quite lightly because his eldest child, Eleanor, 20, has just started a midwifery course. She gets her fees paid and receives a bursary of \u00a3100 a month. But her accommodation costs \u00a350 a week and she has to commute between the university in Nottingham and a hospital in Milton Keynes. </p> <p>This, though, is just the beginning. Don and his wife Wendy, 48, have another five children: Adele 15, Charlotte 13, Lydia 12, Laurence eight and Alastair four. 'As yet we're not sure what our commitment will be for Eleanor and, as we would also like to make allowances for the others to go to university, this is a long-term commitment.' </p> <p>Don wants to know if they are financially secure: 'We would like to be able to replace our main family car next year. This is a 12-year-old Citro\u00ebn eight-seater that we have owned for eight years.' They have another two cars which are both classics but not expensive to run. One car is a 1960 Ford Prefect which Don uses to get to work and the other a 1968 Morris Minor that has just got through its MOT. Eleanor wants this to commute between university and hospital but Don is worried about insurance costs: 'She is already a named driver on our insurance but then she will become the main driver.' Despite the two classics, cars are not Don's hobby: 'I only tinker with the cars when I have to. Most of the time it is point and pay - you point out what is wrong with it and pay someone else to do it.' </p> <p>A major expense this year was a holiday in Australia for the whole family: 'We wanted to go to Sydney, despite the fact that it was a long way.' </p> <p>Their four-bedroom house is worth about \u00a3150,000 although, as an 80-year-old 'one-off', it is difficult to value without putting it on the market. They have an interest-only mortgage of \u00a345,000 with Direct Line, covered by four life insurance policies, three with Sun Alliance and one with Barclays Life. These mature over the next three years, with a projected surplus of \u00a316,800. </p> <p>Don's job includes life insurance and long-term sickness insurance. They also have a joint whole-life insurance policy for \u00a340,000 which pays out when the first one dies. </p> <p>He contributes 10 per cent of his salary to a Norwich Union pension and his employer puts in 7 per cent. Although his youngest son will still be facing GCSEs when Don is 65, he is toying with the idea of early retirement: 'I'd retire tomorrow if I could and it has been suggested that I might be able to retire two or three years early because there will be sufficient funds for me to take retirement. But I would like to know if I am contributing enough.'</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Joanne Cox</strong></p> <p>The spread of the children's ages means that Don and Wendy have plenty of time to save and, when the mortgage is repaid, will have extra disposable income as well as a lump sum. </p> <p>As they want to change their car, and Adele is 15, their short-term needs are the more pressing. They should choose between National Savings and bank and building society accounts. For tax relief, they should maximise contributions to a mini cash Isa and take out another next year.</p> <p>For the longer term, the best returns come from equity Isas, provided Don and Wendy are comfortable investing in a share-based fund. They should write down their income and expenditure to see how much it costs to keep the family afloat each month and plan forward for up to 15 years, then check if Don's sickness insurance continues if he is ill for a long time, and whether they could manage if Wendy was ill. If not, they should think about health insurance.</p> <p>Don should budget for after retirement, remembering that some costs will disappear but others increase, particularly for leisure activities. If his projected pension does not cover the planned expenditure, he should save more. Wendy should check whether she can join an employer's pension scheme or look for a low-cost stakeholder pension next April.</p> <p>The lump sum from the endowments could be used to repay any loans and the excess invested for future university costs. </p> <p>\u0095 Joanne Cox works for Co-operative Bank Financial Advisers.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Lynne Maltby </strong></p> <p>Don should bear in mind that the easiest way to increase income is to reduce outgoings. His monthly expenses will be fairly static until 2002 when the mortgage is scheduled for repayment. In the meantime, he could move his \u00a35,000 loan on to his mortgage which will immediately release spare cash. This, in turn, could be diverted towards Eleanor's university costs. </p> <p>The good news, of course, is that come September 2002 his monthly outgoings will reduce substantially, by about \u00a3450. At that time he should start a short-term cash-based saving scheme for Adele and Charlotte's university costs and look at a longer-term savings structure for the three younger children.</p> <p>Regular saving maxi Isas are appropriate for his five- year objective as they provide tax-free flexibility and a range of low to medium-risk funds.</p> <p>The mortgage is pivotal to Don's financial planning as it looks likely that an extra \u00a315,000 lump sum will be available when his endowments mature. So, as well as having more money to save each month, he should use at least a proportion of the lump sum either to kickstart the savings regime or to provide an additional retirement fund for himself and Wendy.</p> <p>They could think about remortgaging their home, using a repayment mortgage vehicle to tie in with Don's retirement age. This releases equity for their substantial university funding needs. </p> <p>\u0095 Lynne Maltby is a manager with Willis National. </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only. </p> <p>\u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

  "<p>Most people shopping around for a mortgage need to choose between a fixed-rate or a discounted loan. </p> <p>Sometimes, the decision is relatively easy - if it is clear that rates are set to rise substantially, a fixed rate is more attractive - but with rates static, as they have been for the past eight months, it is harder to predict which offers best value. </p> <p>The Bank of England kept the base rate at 6 per cent again this month, and mortgage broker Charcol believes the longer interest rates stay at 6 per cent, the greater the chance they have peaked. Charcol marketing manager Siobhan Hotten predicts they will fall towards the end of the year. The broker has just brought out a new two-year fixed-rate mortgage at 5.49 per cent on 75 per cent loan to value in keeping with this prediction. However, rival broker London &amp; Country thinks the base rate will go up by 0.25 per cent before falling away in the first quarter of next year. </p> <p>If you think rates will soon fall, a discounted mortgage, where the lender charges a set amount below its standard rate, may be tempting. But David Hollingsworth, a mortgage adviser with broker London &amp; Country, says borrowers should think about what they want. If they want the stability of knowing how much they will be paying out each month, they should go for a fixed rate. </p> <p>If rates drop during the fixed period, you always have the option of switching to a mortgage with a lower rate. But then you may be hit with a redemption penalty. </p> <p>There are some highly competitive fixed-rate deals on the market. The base rate would have to plummet for them to become bad value. Northern Rock offers a three-year fix at 5.39 per cent, but there is a redemption penalty equivalent to 3 per cent of the loan in the first two years and 2 per cent in the third year. </p> <p>Discount rate mortgages undercut the lender's standard variable rate, which they track. Hollingsworth says they suit borrowers who can take a rate increase, or who are optimistic. Most discount mortgages have no redemption penalty in the discount period, according to Charcol, so you are free to remortgage. But remortgaging involves costs, typically \u00a3800 on a \u00a3100,000 mortgage. </p> <p>Capped-rate mortgages would seem to offer the best of both worlds: security and the potential to pass on a drop in rates. There is no limit to how much the rate can fall but there is a 'cap' on rate rises. However, this type of mortgage tends to be more expensive than the fixed-rate variety. Check out fixed-rate options first. </p> <p>Some lenders offer a rare hybrid - a mortgage that offers both a capped and a discount rate. But again watch out for penalties. Bristol &amp; West is offering a mortgage capped at 4.99 per cent until 1 November 2001, after which there is a 2 per cent discount for a year.</p>",
  "<p>Following the example of the US is usually seen as a bad way of doing things in this country - whether it means becoming more litigious, saying 'Have a nice day' or eating in McDonald's. </p> <p>But one of the biggest areas of Americanisation in the last decade has been our system of financing higher education. Current undergraduates now have to pay for their own maintenance and tuition fees - a source of anxiety to many parents, who got their own degrees for free. </p> <p>And the load is getting heavier on new graduates. The complete withdrawal of grants means that students graduating next summer are likely to have debts of between \u00a312,000 and \u00a315,000, according to the National Union of Students - a massive hike on the \u00a35,300 average debt for students graduating in 1999, according to research by Barclays bank. </p> <p>For the class of 2000, debt was reduced because many received grants each year. But most of the class of 2001 will have studied under a new system with no grant so they took out government loans through the Student Loans Company. The maximum loan this year is \u00a33,445 outside London (\u00a34,590 in the capital). Unlike their parents, they are also paying tuition fees of \u00a31,050 a year, with calls from the universities to raise them to as much as \u00a34,000 a year. </p> <p>But if we follow the US example, our graduates could be leaving university with debts closer to \u00a335,000 - or more if studying medicine, law or business. US universities are free to set their own fees - and many of them charge more than \u00a310,000 a year. Putting a child through college has spawned a huge financial industry in the US. You can even get tips on the web about keeping costs down when the family goes on a two-week trip with young Freddie in the camper van to visit the different universities on offer. </p> <p>In the UK we are seeing the start of similar moves. Calls from the top universities for more freedom in setting fees is just one part of a new desire for greater liberalisation. Conservative Party proposals to give huge endowments to universities and let them manage their own money is another move in the same direction. If Oxford University - current endowment funds estimated at \u00a31.5 billion - ends up with funds in the order of \u00a310bn (the amount that Harvard sits on), then it is likely to take a more commercial approach both to the setting of fees and to the awarding of scholarships. </p> <p>A big difference between the countries is that Americans are far more likely to get bursaries and scholarships than Britons. Laura Spence, the would-be medical student rejected by Oxford in controversial circumstances this year, is just starting her Harvard course after winning grants worth \u00a365,000. </p> <p>Whenever you hear experts expressing their worry about the brain drain, you can expect the argument to go towards giving universities a freer hand in setting fees. US academics earn considerably more than their UK counterparts. The simplest way to pay lecturers higher salaries would be to put up course fees but that would almost certainly lead to even greater graduate debt. </p> <p>In the US, students and their families are far more likely to see higher education as a commodity. They are unlikely to run up debts of \u00a335,000 by the age of 21 unless they think it worthwhile financially in the long run. This kind of consideration is already becoming more important here. The economics department at Warwick University recently produced a report which shows that a first-class degree is worth, on average, 12 per cent more in likely future earnings than a third and that male law and politics graduates (the best paid) are likely to earn twice as much as female agriculture graduates (the worst paid). Research from the High Fliers recruitment agency suggests a link between university and future pay - with Imperial College (London), Oxford and Cambridge graduates likely to earn a third more than Glasgow and Cardiff alumni. </p> <p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders sees graduate debt as 'an issue we can't afford to ignore', according to deputy director general Peter Williams. Might graduates postpone buying property so they can pay off their debts? What effect does this have on house prices if the bottom rung of first-time buyers suddenly falls away? Research conducted for the council by analysts London Economics concludes that the effect is likely to be minimal - not least because graduates tend to earn well and become quite accustomed to dealing with debt. But the council will continue to monitor the situation - especially if interest rates rise and the economic climate becomes less buoyant. </p> <p>Whatever the effect on property prices and ownership all graduates will have to learn to deal with debt.</p> <p><strong>\u00a313,000 of debt - but Kate's had a ball </strong></p> <p>Kate Emmanuel graduated in 1998 and still has about \u00a313,000 of debt - but she is happy about it. </p> <p>During her four-year international manage-ment and French course at the University of Bath, she spent a year in Montreal and then, a few months after graduation, went to New York for several months.</p> <p>'I have had a brilliant time,' says the 23-year old. 'Some of my friends scrimped and saved throughout university and never took out a loan. But I took out all the loans I could - and I did what I wanted.</p> <p>'If I wanted to go out for a meal, I did. I didn't live off baked beans. So now I have a big dump of debt to pay off - but most people have a mortgage to pay off. It's just like paying that.'</p> <p>She was the first person from her family to go to university, encouraged by a careers adviser who was impressed by her results at school.</p> <p>Although she was one of the last undergraduates to get a grant, she still needed other funds. So she got a free overdraft with the campus branch of Barclays ('they have been brilliant') and, in each of the four years, she drew down her full loan from the Student Loan Company.</p> <p>Her plan was to maximise her income, rather than cutting the outgoings. In her second year, she worked in a caf\u00e9. In her final year, she worked in a French restaurant in the city. 'It meant that I met all the French people in Bath. I was constantly having conversations in French.'</p> <p>When she graduated in July 1998, she knew that payback time had arrived. She took two jobs - as an office manager in the day, and a waitress some evenings - to pay off the \u00a33,000 overdraft she had accumulated.</p> <p>She paid off this by May 1999 when she went to New York, having negotiated another \u00a33,000 loan from Barclays.</p> <p>Now she is working for an internet service provider in Cardiff. Having started as a PA there, she has expanded her role to include liaison.</p> <p>She is also preparing to start repaying her student loan from April. Her fairly low level of earnings means that she has not had to repay any so far.</p> <p>She does not worry about her debts now. When she was at university, however, she did have the occasional sleepless night. But when she went to see her bank and discussed her affairs with them, she learnt how to control the situation.</p> <p>This seems to be the key to her peace of mind: 'As long as my finances were in control they were fine. I realised that as long as I tightened up in one area, I could survive if I really wanted to pay for something else.'</p> <p>So now she is on the verge of buying a car - on hire purchase. She does not need to worry about buying a house - because she now lives with her partner in Cardiff and he had already bought a property.</p> <p>The pension is the next issue.
