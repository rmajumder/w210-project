  "<p>Rt Hon Tony Blair MP Prime Minister; Leader of the Labour Party (1). <br> </p> <p> Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP Chancellor of the Exchequer (3).<br> </p> <p> Alan Greenspan Chairman, American Federal Bank Reserve (7).</p> <p> The man revered as the architect of the unprecedented economic boom in the US is facing his biggest test. His every pout, strut, and subtle change in syntax or vocabulary is analysed and counter-analysed by global markets. His greatest test may come after next month's Presidential elections. The Fed, although politically independent, has held off from changing interest rates in the run-up to the polls. Greenspan, originally appointed by Ronald Reagan, was accused of losing George Bush Sr the 1992 election after interest rate hikes just before the poll. With the US trade deficit spiralling out of control and growth still stellar, Greenspan will be responsible for 'the soft landing' of the economy. Despite all the adulation he has received in the past, it is this job which will prove the ultimate test of his mythical abilities, and may prove the difference between global boom or global slump.<br> </p> <p> <br> Steve Case Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, AOL; chairman designate, AOL-Time Warner (59). </p> <p> If, in 10 years' time, the impact of the internet amounts to a fraction of the wild claims made for it now, then much of the credit will go to Steve Case. The proposed \u00a3128 billion merger of his company, America Online with Time Warner, itself trying to merge with UK music group, EMI, represents the first conjuncture of old and new media. He barely registered on last year's list but this year he was the star of the show at the Davos World Economic Forum, eclipsing even Bill Gates, and he was proclaimed king of the new establishment by the US glossies. The creation of AOL-Time Warner is the practical manifestation of digital convergence. Television, movies, music and computer games will be available on demand in homes over high-speed data links. Case was in a position to broker the deal because AOL was among that rarest of breeds: the profit-making internet company.<br> </p> <p> Alastair Campbell Press Secretary to the Prime Minister (5).<br> </p> <p> Sir Eddie George Governor, Bank of England (8). <br> </p> <p> 'Steady but ready' Eddie's influence over interest rates has strengthened over the past year. He has made the casting vote in the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee on at least two occasions, keeping mortgage costs constant since February. Sir Edward became Governor of the Bank of England in 1993. His term was renewed for a further five years in 1998, his powers then greatly enhanced by Labour's granting of operational independence to the Bank in 1997, but weakened by the removal of regulatory powers over the financial sector. Last month he helped coordinate an international effort to prop up the ailing euro. But he is a noted eurosceptic, and as the Chancellor has tempered his euro-enthusiasm, and the economy prospered, so the relationship between the two men has improved. They now get on well. </p> <p> Bill Clinton President of United States of America (4). <br> </p> <p> Clinton's foreign policy often lays the foundation for the UK's. Labour modelled its election campaign on the 1992 Clinton victory; Blair used Clinton to promote peace in Northern Ireland. The United States dominated Nato policy over Kosovo, refusing to deploy US ground troops. Refused to assist Blair to forge a republican compromise on the RUC issue, which Clinton thinks should be addressed as outlined in the Patten report. Recently his influence in the Mid-East has been questioned. Such is the ephemeral nature of political power that Clinton - whose term ends in January- is unlikely to figure in this list next year.<br> </p> <p> Bill Gates Chairman, Microsoft (2).<br> </p> <p> The past 12 months have not been a great year for the world's richest man. The software guru has suffered the ignominy of having his company branded a monopoly by the US government which is now examining ways of breaking the firm up. Nevertheless Gates, 44, is still worth more than $60bn and it is far from certain that Microsoft will do the splits. Slow to realise the importance of the internet, Gates is now refocusing Microsoft into a company which aims to write the code for the next generation of internet-compatible devices. Disliked by some for the way his company has dominated the industry, Gates, married with two children, does not outwardly give the impression of being a bully. Quiet and reserved Gates has pledged to give away 95 per cent of his wealth to civic and philanthropic causes when he dies.</p> <p> Rupert Murdoch Chairman and Chief Executive, News Corporation (6).<br> </p> <p> Four million daily Sun readers and the 700,000 Times readers. His Sunday Times and News of the World are formidable money-making machines. In BSkyB Murdoch has 40 per cent and effective control of Western Europe's most profitable broadcaster. Was diagnosed with low grade prostate cancer recently, so speculation mounts that he is grooming a successor. His son Lachlan was last week appointed deputy at News Corp and seems the sibling most likely. As the election nears there will again be speculation as to the influence Murdoch wields over his editors.<br> </p> <p> <br> Sir John Browne Chief executive, BP Amoco; Trustee of the British Museum (23).</p> <p> It has often been said of Sir John Browne that he wields more power and has more influence over our lives than the aver age minister. After September's fuel crisis demonstrated Government impotence in guaranteeing petrol supplies, and its inability to force oil companies to ensure them, the Prime Minister may himself ruefully reflect on the truth of this remark. Browne has built BP from an important, but second tier oil company, to a global 'supermajor' capable of competing with the likes of Exxon. Two significant deals - the purchase of US oil company Amoco for pounds 30bn in 1998 and its subsequent acquisition of Arco pounds 18bn - have propelled the company to a market value of nearly pounds 138 bn and to the second slot in the FTSE 100 index. </p> <p>Highest new entry<br> John Chambers President and CEO, Cisco Systems Inc. </p> <p> Chambers, 51, is the man who wired the world. His company, Cisco, makes the hardware and software which powers the internet. It does all the back-end, boring stuff which means that it is set to benefit massively from the demand for e-business solutions. 'Are you ready?' runs the company's ads heralding the internet revolution. Cisco certainly was and its share price soared 50,000 per cent in a decade. Chambers is the internet revolution's biggest cheerleader and is the biggest critic. Cisco became the most valuable firm in the US earlier this year when it temporarily overtook Microsoft. </p> <p> <br> Chris Gent Chief Executive, Vodafone (31).</p> <p> UK's market leader in mobile phones, Vodafone's coup de grace was the takeover of German telecom company Mannesmann, valuing it at more than \u00a382 billion. Has become the world's biggest mobile phone operator.</p> <p> Rt Hon Peter Mandelson MP Northern Ireland Secretary (25).</p> <p> Returned to Cabinet after only 10 months in wilderness. After initial success, the peace process now seems precariously balanced in the face of Unionist opposition and republican refusal to compromise.</p> <p> Jonathan Powell Downing Street Chief of Staff (9).</p> <p> Became Tony Blair's chief of staff in 1995. Acts as the PM's fixer, liaising with civil servants, and behind-the-scenes Northern Ireland envoy. Refuted allegations that he masterminded whispering campaigns against Mo Mowlam and Frank Dobson. </p> <p> Nobuyuki Idei President and CEO, Sony Corporation (154).</p> <p> Leader of the world's largest corporation since 1995. Sony pioneered the video recorder, Walkman and Mini-Disc. His are the slogans 'Digital Dream Kids' and 'ReGeneration'. </p> <p> Greg Dyke Director General, BBC (11).</p> <p> His appointment provoked William Hague to spend \u00a3100,000 on media analysts to monitor BBC output. Drastic shake-up is already under way, with rout of middle management. He has even banned croissants at morning meetings to save costs.</p> <p> Marjorie Scardino CEO, Pearson (48).</p> <p> First female executive of a FTSE 100 company. Former Chief Executive of the Economist, her influence as head of a company that owns the FT, Economist, Penguin Books, Baywatch and Madame Tussaud's secured her number eight slot in Fortune 's list of most powerful women. Shares have doubled in two years.</p> <p> Rt Hon David Blunkett MP Education and Employment Secretary (27).</p> <p> Has direct responsibility for two of the government's key policies: raising school standards and New Deal. Launched inquiry into the marking of national curriculum tests for 11 year olds, and has introduced 'citizenship' classes.</p> <p> Rt Hon John Prescott MP Deputy Prime Minister; Secretary for Environment, Transport and the Regions (13).</p> <p> Presides over an annual transport budget of pounds 3.7bn and housing budget of pounds 2.4bn. Joined Brown behind the 'forces of privilege' campaign. Offered somewhat too eagerly to take reins in running the country so Blair could take paternity leave.</p> <p> Gerry Robinson Chairman, Granada Group; Chairman, Arts Council (39).</p> <p> Granada own a third of the ITV network. At the Arts Council Robinson is in charge of pounds 384 million of government and lottery money. Sits on the Creative Industries taskforce. </p> <p> Rt Hon Jack Straw MP Home Secretary (28).</p> <p> Remains a figure of calm as storms rage over Labour but...criticised over watering down of Freedom of Information Bill; under pressure to introduce race reforms in the wake of the Lawrence report; criticised over Asylum Bill and voucher system for refugees. </p> <p> Rt Hon Robin Cook MP Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Secretary (44).</p> <p> Has been kept busy with Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone and Chechnya, and has frozen military exports to Zimbabwe. Has been pressing Blair to enter the European single currency at an earlier date.</p> <p> Paul Dacre Editor, Daily Mail (19).</p> <p> The Mail outstripped the Daily Mirror's circulation for the first time in 1998, selling 2,421,319, the second highest among UK dailies. Instigated anti-GM foods campaign. Jumped on the asylum-seekers bandwagon, portraying many of them as bogus and thieves.</p> <p> Sir Richard Sykes Chairman and Chief Executive, Glaxo Wellcome (22).</p> <p> Appointed by Blair to the Council for Science and Technology, he opened the Edward Jenner Institute for vaccine research, to which Glaxo contributed pounds 10m. In May 1999 was named Business Leader of the Year. Paid pounds 3.63m last year.</p> <p> <br> Sir Richard Branson Founder &amp; Chairman, Virgin (32).</p> <p> Recently sold extracts of his autobiography Losing My Virginity to the Sun while a rival paper extracted Tom Bower's less flattering and unauthorised biography. Still hoping to land licence for National Lottery. </p> <p> Sir Peter Bonfield Chief Executive, British Telecommunications; Non-executive director, AstraZeneca (26).</p> <p> BT Cellnet will have stolen a march on competitors if its launch of the UK's first high-speed internet access succeeds.</p> <p> Lord Derry Irvine of Lairg QC Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain (33).</p> <p> Introduced Tony Blair to Cherie Booth when they were pupils in his chambers. His changes to the trial-by-jury system provoked outrage, especially from the Law Society. Now looking at judicial appointments after objections to his own choices. </p> <p> Wim Duisenburg President, European Central Bank (35).</p> <p> Dutch ex-banker now dubbed Mr Euro. Low value of the currency has adverse effect on UK exports to Euroland. The ECB faces allegations of lack of transparency in terms of policy and interest-rate decisions.</p> <p> Gerhard Schroder Chancellor, Germany (12).</p> <p> Glossy election campaign won him power and tag of 'Herr Blair', he took over a delicate role in European politics and an economy with 10.6% unemployment - 5m people. Hit early on by the departure of finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, due to policy divisions. </p> <p> Ed Balls Chief Economic Adviser to Gordon Brown (45).</p> <p> One of a handful of people the Chancellor will listen to, Balls is a prime mover behind the Americanisation of Labour economic policy. Regarded as 'deputy chancellor', he sees every key Treasury paper and is an advocate of welfare-to-work and promoting individual opportunity.</p> <p> Philip Gould Strategic Adviser (60).</p> <p> One of the architects of New Labour, key adviser to Tony Blair; married to Gail Rebuck of Random House. Gould is one of the most important people in Blair's inner circle.</p> <p> <br> Mark Moody-Stuart Group Chairman, Royal Dutch Shell (77).</p> <p> His reforms have upturned Shell's fortunes. Despite efforts to repair relations with the Ogoni people of Nigeria over the past two years ending in violence, with Ken Saro-Wiwa's successor being charged with murder and arson, Moody-Stuart has been hailed as succeeding in shaking up the Anglo-Dutch group and making it perform.</p> <p> Terry Leahy Chief Executive, Tesco (15).</p> <p> With a p\u00a3500m investment programme that will see 22 new stores and 10,000 new jobs, Leahy looks set to ensure Tesco retains its number one slot with 15% of the grocery market. Member of Demos think tank and the government's competitiveness taskforce.</p> <p> David Yelland Editor, the Sun (54).<br> As editor of the best-selling daily tabloid his influence will grow as the election looms and as the debate over the Euro becomes sharper. </p> <p> <br> Sir Robert May President designate, Royal Society; former Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government; Head of Office of Science and Technology (34).</p> <p> Argues for increased government funding for research, and more openness with scientific advice given to government departments. Co-wrote (with Liam Donaldson) report on GM foods, recommending surveillance but also saying there's 'no current evidence' of harmfulness. </p> <p> <br> Louis Gerstner Chairman and CEO, IBM (93).</p> <p> Heading the US computer giant since 1993, he has taken its total assets to $86bn.</p> <p> <br> Michael Eisner Chairman, Walt Disney Corporation (47).</p> <p> In his 14-year tenure Disney's market value has risen from $2bn to $75bn. But he lost in legal battle against former deputy Jeffrey Katzenberg over loss of earnings.</p> <p> <br> Steve Jobs Interim CEO, Co-founder Apple Computer Inc (68).</p> <p> Back in the limelight, turning the fortunes of Apple around with the new iMac. Results show increased demand for PowerMac G4 and new PowerBooks. </p> <p> <br> Linus Torvalds Programmer; originated Linux operating system (153).</p> <p> Bill Gates's nemesis: a Finnish student who wrote an operating system to run his own computer seven years ago and then publicised its code on the internet so other programmers could copy, refine and develop it. Linux, the free operating system became the favourite of geeks and system operators and has reached critical mass as many of the largest software and hardware makers announced plans to offer customers Linux-based products. System took pounds 1.25bn worth of business from Microsoft's Windows last year.</p>",

  "<p><strong>I have been involved in very difficult discussions with my employers which could result in my dismissal. Inefficient union officials have added to the problem. When I was involved in a grievance procedure, they failed to produce pages of minutes that would have proved my case. Now they seem reluctant to tell me how my dismissal negotiations are going. </strong></p> <p>You could take your union to court and perhaps win compensation if it breached its duties to represent you effectively. This, however, is a very difficult procedure. If you wanted to try it, you might get free advice from a law centre. You might also think seriously about trying to achieve a settlement with them rather than ending up in court. If poor representation did lead to your dismissal, your case against the union would be easier. </p> <p>You have the right to withdraw your authority for the union to represent you. Your employer would then have to negotiate with you, or with someone else you nominated. But it might be better to ask the union's head office to supply another representative. Some union officials do let clients down. Others dawdle on cases they think are weak. If that were so, they should be frank rather than let you down painfully and slowly. </p> <p> Legal advice from Lewis Silkin.</p>",
  "<p>The internet revolution, say the pundits, raises the possibility of the virtual organisation, allowing people to work from home, their back gardens or even their favourite holiday destinations. The era of the interconnected, wired corporation will see the end of the traditional boundaries between home, the workplace and leisure. </p> <p>If this were true, it would dramatically affect all our institutions. It could be truly stated that the information age is structured on quite different principles from those of the industrial economy. Commuting, like the office block and the central business district, would be a thing of the past. Congestion and traffic pollution would disappear. The very basis of urbanism as a way of life would be redundant. </p> <p>How realistic is this scenario? For a start, it is questionable whether knowledge-based jobs will be in a majority. Other workers - check-out staff, healthcare workers, teachers and those delivering personal services - will always need to travel to work to earn a living. But even for knowledge workers, it is unlikely to be the end of commuting to work. </p> <p>This is because the modern corporation can only be competitive through continuous innovation. </p> <p>Innovation depends on creativity. And a key factor in creativity is sociability. So although knowledge employees may technically be able to work from home, it will re-main necessary for them to meet each other, to interact and to brainstorm. It is through face-to-face contact between colleagues that ideas for new products, business leads and problem-solving emerge. This makes the physical workplace just as important in the future organisation as now. How do companies encourage sociability? </p> <p>The first step is to create effective team dynamics in which personal compatibilities are as important as technical skills. Witness how this is given priority by advertising agencies, publishing houses, R&amp;D departments and sales teams. Colleagues need to get on with each other and have fun together. </p> <p>Consider also workplace architecture. Many companies are redesigning their workplaces around centrally located cafes to encourage socialisation between colleagues who would otherwise rarely meet. In their physical layout, management consultancies and software design firms often resemble airport lounges with their sofas or-ganised around vending machines. </p> <p>For many companies, geographical location is regarded as of utmost importance, even in this age of the much-heralded death of distance. Again, this is to encourage sociability. The reason so many knowledge-based businesses remain in London, despite its congestion and high rental costs, is the cluster factor. The proximity of pubs, restaurants and wine bars enables colleagues to stay in contact out of work. From this, many new business ideas develop. </p> <p>Move to an out-of-town site with excellent facilities and lower costs and the business can die because of the lack of after-hours informal socialisation. For this reason Philips moved some of its design functions from Eindhoven to Amsterdam. It offers a buzz that attracts young creative staff as well as an infrastructure that allows it to flourish. </p> <p>For many companies, corporate events are organised to foster employee sociability. Although the formal agenda may be to approve strategic plans, their real contribution is to bring together colleagues who would otherwise never see each other. This is particularly important for global corporations. Their project teams may be organised to interact through internet technologies but for trust and the exchange of ideas to develop, periodic face-to-face sociability is vital. </p> <p>All such approaches to encouraging sociability at-tempt to nurture tacit knowledge - to encourage colleagues to understand how others work. This strengthens our own personal competencies but at the same time makes us inter-dependent. Because we work well together, we become good at this because others are good at that. I can concentrate on developing my strengths and so can you. We understand how each other thinks and how we each prefer to do different things in an informal but clearly understood division of labour. Only face-to-face sociability allows this to happen. </p> <p>This is why some high-spending football clubs fail to realise their true potential. Buying star players is not enough. Look at Chelsea. To be successful, each player needs to understand how his teammates think. On-the-pitch training is not a substitute for socialisation - which is why many managers turn a blind eye to some of their players' extramural antics. </p> <p>Equally, corporate success is not achieved by hiring superstars. The real key to high performance is combining in-dividual talents through shared understanding and 'hidden' tacit knowledge gained through intense or-ganisational sociability. Many small firms are good at this, particularly if they are located in geographical clusters that facilitate after-hours contacts. </p> <p>Internet technologies will change the ways we work. We will work more from home and communicate with colleagues across greater distances. But this will not make the workplace redundant. Rather, workplaces will be-come think-tanks to stimulate corporate creativity and innovation. Generating and managing tacit knowledge through colleague sociability will be a major challenge. A revolution in management practices will be required if sociability is to be combined with the internet to achieve competitive success. </p> <p><strong>It's a dating agency, a social circle... and a job</strong></p> <p>As old forms of community break down, people are increasingly reliant on the workplace for sociability and a sense of belonging, according to a report by careers consultancy Sanders &amp; Sidney. </p> <p>The report, Friendship Works, shows that sociability is an important element in people's decision to join - and stay with - a company and commit themselves more to work. Two-thirds of respondents said that a sense of community compensated for discontents such as pay. </p> <p>The office has also become much more than a place to work; 80 per cent of employees make friendships that extend beyond the office, and a quarter meet their partner there. Although the report finds that friendship and community have strong business benefits in staff retention and motivation, only 8 per cent of organisations have formal policies for fostering them. A resounding 94 per cent of employees think their employers are missing a trick.</p> <p> Richard Scase is author of Britain in 2010 (Capstone Publishing, 2000) and a professor at the University of Kent</p>",
  "<p>Having dealt the Football Association one blow by ruling himself out of the England job, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is ready to go for the knockout. </p> <p>The Arsenal manager is prepared to take the FA to court if his appeal against a 12-match suspension and \u00a3100,000 fine is rejected. </p> <p>Wenger feels the punishment he received for an incident involving the fourth official Paul Taylor at Sunderland was unjust. He said: \"I will first appeal. If that doesn't work I may have to go to a legal court. I will consider it with a lawyer. </p> <p>\"It is unacceptable that for 12 games I cannot work as I have always done. It will be difficult for me to sit in the stand because I have tried it many times and I have quite a problem with separation from my team.\" </p> <p>Wenger was found guilty of holding Taylor in the tunnel, where tension was high after Patrick Vieira's late dismissal for striking Sunderland's Darren Williams. He insists he had to intervene to prevent a far worse incident involving Williams and Thierry Henry. </p> <p>\"When I heard the sanctions I couldn't believe it,\" Wenger added. \"I feel like I have killed someone. They judged the situation to the letter of the law and didn't look at what intention was involved. My intention was never to hit anybody or insult anybody. I didn't even insult anybody. I just behaved as I think I had to.\" </p> <p>The FA will try to hear the appeal before Wenger's suspension starts on October 30. His punishment was the minimum laid down in the FA's new disciplinary guidelines. </p> <p>One specialist sports lawyer explained what Wenger might try to prove in court if his appeal fails. \"What Arsenal's argument could include is allegations of restraint of trade and arguments over the disproportionality of the punishment because the FA's guidelines do not appear to allow the particular facts and circumstances of a case to be taken into consideration,\" explained Darren Bailey of the law firm Townleys. </p> <p>Wenger feels the FA has been one-eyed in accepting the evidence presented to its disciplinary commission by Taylor. \"They listen to their officials and nobody else,\" he said. \"It's like when you go against the police.\" </p> <p>Henry has claimed he was pushed by Taylor and that his manager intervened only to keep everyone apart, but Wenger does not plan to involve his squad in the appeal. </p> <p>Reiterating that he intends to see out his contract with Arsenal until 2002, Wenger scotched talk of reaching an agreement with the FA to take over the England job in two years, though he did not rule out taking the post in future.</p>",

  "<p>A big Frenchman is currently the toast of Edinburgh. With his permanently smiling face, sticking out ears, and feet the size of large baguettes, Franck Sauz\u00e9e is the talisman of reborn Hibernian. Today Hibernian and Sauz\u00e9e play arguably one of the most significant games in years at Easter Road, when Rangers visit in the Scottish Premier League. </p> <p>Hibs, sitting second in the table, are a point ahead of Rangers, who lie third. The Glasgow club have played one match fewer but the psychology of their supremacy is still not lost on Hibs. A win or a draw today would preserve rare oneupmanship over Rangers. If any faint traces are to remain about Scottish clubs holding the Old Firm in check, Hibs need to take a point or points to add conviction to their valour. </p> <p>If Alex McLeish, who sat at Alex Ferguson's feet at Aberdeen, is the main source of Hibs' revival, Sauz\u00e9e is certainly its imprint on the park. The man who won 39 caps for France - it would have been much more had he not fallen out with G\u00e9rard Houllier - is marauding through matches in Hibs' famous green and white, spraying passes around from his new position as a libero. </p> <p>\"I can hardly believe the way Franck is playing these days,\" says David Zitelli, Hibs' other Frenchman. \"He is the new Beckenbauer.\" </p> <p>Sauz\u00e9e is a rare footballer, who has seen everything and done it all yet still bounds through games excitedly. He will be 35 two weeks from today but exhibits the thrill of a child whenever things are going right on the park. Two weeks ago, having poked a free-kick around St Johnstone's wall to score in the less than intoxicating setting of McDiarmid Park, he ran the length of the field in celebration of his feat. For a man who won the European Cup with Marseille in 1993, this seemed bewildering. </p> <p>\"I'm happy with my football these days and I'm proud to be the captain of Hibs,\" says Sauz\u00e9e. \"At my age, at this stage of my life, I wouldn't still be playing unless I was content within myself.\" </p> <p>When he signed for Hibs in October 1999, Sauz\u00e9e agreed to play for a year. Now he is into his second season, and it looks like he will stay for a third. </p> <p>Today he resembles an old warhorse who plays with a certain Gallic flair, but the vestiges of the old Sauz\u00e9e are still very evident. Tall, elegant, with an appetite for the biting tackle, he was a forceful presence in French international teams through a period of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when that team did not otherwise fulfil its rich potential. </p> <p>At club level Sauz\u00e9e has been the happy vagrant. After learning his craft with Sochaux, he moved, still aged only 23, to Marseille, but this first spell with his home-town team was to prove stormy. From Marseille it was along the Cte d'Azur to Monaco in 1990, then back to Marseille for two seasons in 1991, before Serie A and Atalanta Bergamo beckoned in 1993. </p> <p>His dainty feet were employed by Strasbourg and Montpellier before Hibs' siren call 18 months ago. After a stirring decade of action, Sauz\u00e9e has found contentment in Scotland's capital. </p> <p>His first match in the biting atmosphere north of the border could not have been less alluring - against Falkirk at crumbling Brockville Park. \"I remember playing in that match and maybe having 10 touches of the ball in total - the play just went on above my head,\" says Sauz\u00e9e. \"But coming to Hibs has been a great move for me. Alex McLeish is a good coach and Edinburgh is a fantastic city.\" </p> <p>Zitelli, whom McLeish signed in August as a brother-in-arms for Sauz\u00e9e, describes his compatriot as \"a changed man\" since being unleashed on the Scottish game. \"He has opened up, has flourished and is making the most of life,\" says Zitelli. \"And he is still capable of impressing on the pitch.\" </p> <p>Last season, in an horrific incident, Sauz\u00e9e lost three front teeth in a prang on the pitch. His new dental work is not the only patched-up aspect of this thrillingly restored footballer.</p>",
  "<p>The international players' union FIFPro announced after a meeting with the European Union competition chief Mario Monti it would have nothing more to to with the task force set up to hammer out proposals to revamp the game's transfer rules until it took players' demands seriously. </p> <p>\"Fifa and the leagues want their education programmes for young players but they're not willing to do anything for 'normal' players over the age of 23,\" the FIFPro secretary general Theo van Seggelen said yesterday.</p> <p>\"We won't speak with the task force any more until they come to us with proposals that are acceptable. Mr Monti assured us the European Commission won't approve any proposal if we're not involved in it too.\"</p> <p>Football's governing bodies set up the task force in an effort to prevent Monti outlawing the current transfer system, which he says breaks European rules on fair competition and abuses workers' rights to freedom of movement. They say banning the current system would throw the game into chaos but, under pressure from the Commission, have pledged to come up with proposals by the end of October to prevent the transfer system being banned.</p> <p>Van Seggelen, who met Monti with the FIFPro President Gordon Taylor and a delegation of players from around Europe, said fears of chaos were exaggerated. \"We don't think anything much will happen to football under a new system. Changes won't influence the game much,\" he said.</p> <p>Fifa has suggested allowing the free movement of players over the age of 24 and ending transfers for players under the age of under-18-year-olds 18, but said clubs should be able to seek compensation for the transfer of players of between 18 and 24.</p> <p>FIFPro, however, believe the plans would discriminate against older players. \"We want to clarify the situation for players of over 23, as to whether they have the possibility to break their contracts. The trouble is that the clubs still think they can make money from the trade in players,\" Van Seggelen said. He said the unions backed the idea of \"transfer windows\" - or limited periods during the year when players could move.</p> <p>Monti's office said in a statement that FIFPro had expressed its disappointment at the lack of progress made by the task force and that the players said they were willing to go to court if their concerns were not taken into account.</p> <p>\"I hope that Fifa, Uefa, the leagues, the clubs and the players will make all efforts possible to arrive at a solution which preserves the specificity of sport while respecting national legislation on contracts, the free circulation of players and EU law,\" the statement quoted Monti as saying.</p>",
  "<p>Just one more strange day in the very strange career of Michael Knighton, who faces a red-card demonstration today from Carlisle fans keen to see the back of him. </p> <p>Last month Knighton was banned from being a director of any company after a DTI investigation into a school in Huddersfield owned by Knighton that went into liquidation, but he remains in control of the club, thanks to his 93% shareholding in the holding company. </p> <p>One surprising ally of the fans is Chelsea's managing director Colin Hutchinson, who did time at Brunton Park in the early 80s and still has shares in the club. \"For the sake of the club, Michael Knighton should hand it over to people who are prepared to invest in it,\" Hutchinson said. \"Local people trusted by the fans should be in charge. It should be a community club.\" </p> <p>Quite right too, though it's not a concept he has been noticeably attached to at Chelsea. </p> <p>\u0095A disappointingly thin turn-out of football folk at Reggie Kray's funeral on Wednesday, with only David Webb and Alan Curbishley's brother holding the fort. However, Paul Gascoigne seems to have learned something from the lovable East End mobsters, if his theory of getting the best out of England's youngsters is any guide. \"I would like to hammer our kids. Bring them on nicely, but show them respect.\" Hammer? Respect? It might have come straight out of the twins' own coaching manual. </p> <p>\u0095Some of David O'Leary's \"babies\" may enjoy life in the fast lane, but Matthew Jones is not among them. The South Wales Echo reports that Jones's idea of a good night out does not involve the usual temptations open to young men with plenty of money. \"When my gran comes up we all go to the local bingo hall in one big group,\" Jones said. \"In fact I have become a member of the bingo hall. That's what my gran and my family would do back home in Llanelli, so why not in Leeds?\" Don Revie would have approved. </p> <p>\u0095One of the founding myths of English football, \"the Russian linesman\", has had a solid airing this week after Ray Parlour's misfortune in Helsinki. And it is a myth, of course, created in those far-off days when everyone from the Soviet Union was Russian. It's far too late to change his fate now, but the linesman was Azerbaijani, as anyone who has been to the Tofik Bakhramov Stadium in Baku can testify. </p> <p>\u0095Usually reliable TV watchers report an extraordinary exchange on Sky this week. Commenting on the possibility of Terry Venables taking over from Kevin Keegan, a respected broadsheet journalist is said to have remarked that his reappointment would be vetoed by the chairman of the FA's international committee, Noel White, whom he described as \"the nigger in the woodpile\". Surely it can't be true. </p> <p>\u0095Not for the first time this season, the Scottish Premier League has shown a wanton disrespect for tradition and the needs of disoriented travelling fans. Once again, all five matches this weekend kick off at the absurd time of three o'clock on a Saturday afternoon. </p> <p>\u0095In this week's release from the Ryman League, Premier Division Gravesend &amp; Northfleet announce the availability of their 20-year-old striker Dexley Fidyk. In the limited space provided, all the club could say is that Dexley \"has an excellent attitude and lives in SW London\". How refreshing it would be if bigger clubs had to sell their players using the same brutal shorthand of the small ads columns. How confident would they be of getting rid of the likes of Stan Collymore (\"unwanted gift\"), Paul Gascoigne (\"needs some work\") or Tore Andre Flo (\"hardly used\")? </p> <p>\u0095No doubt Peter Taylor will enjoy the traditional magnum of champagne (not to mention the traditional losing streak) after being voted manager of the month for September. In South Africa, however, they have no truck with such pretentious nonsense. Bruce Grobbelaar, now in charge of Pretoria's SuperSport United, has just received the equivalent award, which entitled him to 72 cases of beer. </p> <p> mike.ticher@theguardian.com</p>",
  "<p> Y ou don't have to be middle-aged and male to start your own business here - but it helps! The bumper stickers were the only things missing when, at an enterprise-boosting inititiave earlier this year, the government wheeled out the usual suspects like Alan Sugar, Richard Branson and Stelios Haji-Ioannou (pictured, right, with the PM). </p> <p> Yet according to new research entrepreneurial spirit is flourishing among the under-25s. In a poll of 16 to 24-year olds by the BBC's Essentials website, half claim to want to start their own businesses in the future, and of these one in ten have ambitions to go solo within the next two years. </p> <p> Being in control of their own destiny is an aspiration for 48% of respondents, while making more money appeals to just over a third of those about to make their first career choice. However existing research suggests that in Britain many graduates fail to follow through their intentions. </p> <p>A study of 10 countries published last year by the London Business School and Babson College, in Boston, Massachusetts, found that one adult in 12 was trying to start a business in the US, compared with one in 30 in the UK. Only 16% of Britons thought there were good opportunities for a start-up in the short term, compared with 57 % in the US. </p> <p> The key is confidence - in yourself and in your idea, says Mark Desvaux, a Swansea University graduate who has been starting businesses since the age of eight when he began selling tea to enthusiasts at his father's model aeroplane club. Other ventures included organising group ski-trips while on a student exchange to Canada. </p> <p> After graduating with a degree in management science, Mark considered starting his own internet search engine business, but instead spent four years as a consultant with a big internet service provider before plucking up the courage to set up HouseWeb - an online property site - at the end of last year. </p> <p> \"I've often wondered what might have happened had I taken the plunge straight after university,\" he says. \"I gained invaluable experience during my four years of employment and it's meant I've probably made fewer mistakes than I would have done. But if I had to advise a graduate who believes 100% their business idea will work, I'd say go for it.

  "<p>Marrakech's bewilderingly seductive <strong> Djemaa el Fna </strong> square has left a powerful impression on visiting writers. These range from Elias Canetti and Paul Bowles - who said, without it, Marrakech could be any Moroccan city - to Esther Freudin her novel turned film, Hideous Kinky. </p> <p>But perhaps the most telling word comes from one still living in the medina, Juan Goytisolo - known to the locals as \"the Spaniard\". Hymning the transient life of Djemaa el Fna in his novel Makbara (Serpent's Tail), he scoffs at the contradictory advice fed to tourists; namely to approach in daylight or after nightfall, by stealthy observation from its caf\u00e9 terraces or through a headlong plunge into its perpetual commotion. \"All the guidebooks lie,\" he writes. \"There is simply no way of getting a firm grip on it.\" </p> <p>Less a square than an irregular expanse, abutted by souks and spectacularly backed by the high Atlas mountains, Djemaa el Fna may have been named \"assembly of the dead\" as a place of execution, or \"mosque of nothing\" after an abandoned building plan. But it now draws Marrakchis and strangers alike in a perpetual round of trading, eating and entertainment. </p> <p>Partly for its protean elusiveness, Djemaa el Fna is a compelling spectacle, with a sensory overload of cooking smells and stove smoke, car horns and mesmeric drum beats. Musicians, snake-charmers, acrobats, healers and henna painters compete to beguile onlookers. </p> <p>The culture of the city, founded in the 11th century as a Berber hub, reflects its Arab-African origins, as Berbers mingled with Arabs, Saharan nomads and gnaoua - descendants of sub-Saharan slaves who produce the drumming trance music of the square. While Muslim women in the casbah may still wear the all-enveloping burka, younger ones are to be seen astride mopeds in sleeveless blouses and see-through gauze. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong><br> </p> <p> Marrakech divides broadly into the still vibrant <strong> medina</strong>, rebuilt under the French protectorate of 1912-56, and the new town of <strong> Gueliz</strong>. The city walls - made of tabia, the red mud of the plains mixed with lime - can be traced in a cal\u00e8che, or pony trap, as part of a two-hour tour (roughly \u00a316). This takes in the palmery, the oasis on which the Berber city was founded,and where stunning sunsets can be enjoyed. </p> <p>The 12th-century <strong> Koutoubia mosque</strong>, just west of Djemaa el Fna, is a towering city landmark deemed the finest Islamic monument in north Africa. </p> <p>Little remains of the city's founding Almoravid dynasty apart from the ruins of a palace beside the Koutoubia. But to the north of the square, amid the labyrinth of souks, is the <strong> Ben Yusuf medersa</strong>, or koranic school, which was largely rebuilt during the 16th- to 17th-century, again with Andalucian influence. (Open 8.30am-noon, 2.30om-6.30pm; 60p). </p> <p>South of Djemaa el Fna, palaces nestle beside the <strong> Mellah</strong>, literally \"salt market\" and once the largest Jewish ghetto in Morocco. It thrived after the 15th-century expulsions from Catholic Spain, but most of the Jewish population left for Casablanca in the last century or emigrated. The quarter remains a place of trade, in everything from TVs to rosewater. </p> <p>The <strong> Saadian El Badi palace</strong>, meaning \"the incomparable\", is also in ruins, but worth seeing for its grandiose scale. (Open 8.30am-noon, 2.30pm-6.30pm; 60p, plus about 60p tip for the guide.) Nearby are the lavishly decorated <strong> Saadian tombs</strong> (same hours and entrance fee). Rediscovered in 1917 and restored under French rule, they have separate men's and women's rooms, and zellij (intricate tiles) on tombs in the open cemetery - they all face east to Mecca, but are occupied by Marrakchi Jews. </p> <p>It is worth a walk through the adjoining casbah, where men sometimes sit outside sewing djellabas (hooded outer garment), while mosharabi , window screens above the doors, allow women to check visitors without being seen. The ubiquitous hand motif on door knockers guards against the evil eye. </p> <p>Back across the Mellah is the late 19th-century <strong> Bahia palace</strong>, which houses the king's retinue on his visits to the city. (Open - unless the king is in town - 8.30am-11.45am and 2.30pm-5.45pm; 60p.) </p> <p>Shaded gardens across the city offer relief from the dry heat. The <strong> Menara</strong> in the south, less a garden than an olive grove for picnickers, has a tranquil reservoir around which Marrakchis gather with ice creams. Most captivating is the <strong> Jardin Majorelle</strong>, north of Gueliz, now owned by Yves Saint Laurent. (Open winter 8am-noon, 2pm-5pm; summer 8am-noon, 3pm-7pm;60p.) Bamboo, palms and giant cacti flourish alongside a lily pond with goldfish, and the cool green is offset by walls and tiles paintedroyal blue. The small <strong> Museum of Islamic Arts</strong> (60p) is also worth a glimpse. </p> <p><strong> The souks</strong><br> </p> <p> Anyone serious about buying a carpet or kilim would do well to get their bearings at <strong> La Maison du Tapis</strong> (7 Derb Baissi, Kasbah), a government co-op where fixed prices mean you can accept a mint tea without undue pressure to buy. </p> <p>Few leave without some ceramics - brightly coloured from Safi, or more subdued from Fes. There is also silverwear, leather, brass and copper, and instruments heard in the square, such as tambourines and drums. </p> <p><strong> Out of town</strong><br> </p> <p> The Atlantic fishing port of <strong> Essaouira</strong> is more than three hours away by bus, but under two by long-distance grand-taxi or in a tour minibus. Founded by the Romans and colonised by the Portuguese in the 17th century, it is a beautiful Moorish-Portuguese harbour town, with a wall of cannons pointing to the sea. There is also a thriving artists' quarter (galleries include the <strong> Gallerie Frederic Damgaard</strong>, Avenue Oqba Ibn Nafiaa) and thuya wood artisans galore. <strong> Afalkay Art</strong> (9 Place My Hassan) is one of several wooden craft shops with fixed prices. </p> <p>Try freshly caught grilled fish in the harbour, or take a table overlooking the sea at <strong> Le Chalet de La Plage</strong> (Boulevard Mohammed V, tel: 475972), for a banquet of oysters (12 for\u00a38) and sardines garnished with coriander (\u00a32.50) - which bear no resemblance to the sad minnows in tins. </p> <p>The <strong> Ourika valley</strong>, a summer haven for better-off Marrakchis, though prone to lethal flash floods, is a grand-taxi ride south past clay-red Berber villages camouflaged amid the foothills. You can stop at Berber markets on Monday and Thursday for a glimpse of local life, and there is a Berber Museum en route which is more a shop for artefacts. A stylish stop for lunch with a view is the <strong> Hotel Restaurant Ramuntcha </strong> (Vall\u00e9e de L'Ourika, Aghbalou, tel: 114373).</p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>Travelscene (020-8427 8800 <a href=\"http://www.travelscene.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.travelscene.co.uk</a>) organises weekend breaks in Marrakech for \u00a3408pp (based on two adults sharing) including return GB Airways flights from London Gatwick and two nights' B&amp;B at the five-star Imperial Borj Hotel.

  "<p>Last winter saw a blizzard of ski-site launches, most of which have now matured and begun to prove their worth. Skiers are a travel site's favourite target: they come back to a site often to check on the state of the powder on their favourite mountain; they want better chalets; and, as their skiing improves, information about new resorts. They are much more likely to buy insurance and expensive kit, too. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.iglu.com\">Iglu.com</a><br> Iglu's specialism is ski accommodation for groups of at least four, although it also has special offers on packages and is especially keen to promote weekend ski breaks; these start at \u00a399, excluding flights.

  "<p>With snow already on the horizon and the choices of how to get to it greater than ever, the task of planning a wintersports holiday is a daunting affair. It is not just a case of where, when, with whom and how much, but also how you should go about it. </p> <p>The vast majority of ski holidays will be sold by the six largest tour operators, Crystal (now owned by Thomson), Inghams, Airtours, Thomson, First Choice and Neilson. Crystal alone goes to 110 resorts in 11 countries. Add to that another 150 specialist operators and your choice more than doubles to over 300 resorts around the world. </p> <p>Independent travel to resorts used to be a costly and inconvenient option. But now with low-cost airlines, easy-to-arrange transfers, and accommodation that can be booked on the internet, the equation has changed. </p> <p>There are numerous self-drive options, particularly to destinations in France and Switzerland, while the Eurostar now has a Friday overnight departure from Waterloo which gives you an extra day's skiing. </p> <p>Don't restrict your options by going to a high-street travel agent. Their brochure choice is limited and geared towards the large tour operators, which often own the agency. </p> <p>AITO (The Association of Independent Tour Operators, 020-8744 9280) produces an annual ski directory listing 28 ski companies covering 178 resorts in nine countries. </p> <p>There are two good ski and snowboarding guide books - Where to Ski and Snowboard 2001 (NortonWood Publishing, \u00a315.99) and The Good Skiing &amp; Snowboarding Guide 2001 (Which? \u00a315.99). These are updated annually and give listings of ski companies and the resorts they go to. They cover more than 180 companies, but not all of these are bonded, which means your holiday and money are not guaranteed if something goes wrong. </p> <p>For independent advice, you can talk to the small, specialist agencies, which are staffed by skiers and are paid on a commission basis. </p> <p>A number of websites give detailed reports on resorts, weather and snow conditions and thousands of holidays. The most comprehensive is Ifyoutravel, which has more than 150,000 holidays, information on thousands of resorts worldwide, including 360 degree panoramas of 20 Alpine resorts, hundreds of webcams, daily snow and weather reports, and 150 interactive resort town maps so that you can actually pinpoint your chalet or hotel. </p> <p><strong> Big six operators</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Airtours </strong> 0870 608 1950 </p> <p><strong> Crystal</strong> 0870 848 7000 (<a href=\"http://www.crystalski.co.uk\">www.crystalski.co.uk</a>) </p> <p><strong> First Choice</strong> 0870 754 3477 </p> <p><strong> Inghams</strong> 020-8780 4444 (<a href=\"http://www.inghams.co.uk\">www.inghams.co.uk</a>) </p> <p><strong> Neilson</strong> 0870 514 1414 </p> <p><strong> Thomson</strong> 0870 606 1470 </p> <p><strong> Specialists</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ski Solutions</strong> 020-7471 7700 (<a href=\"http://www.skisolutions.com\">www.skisolutions.com</a>) </p> <p><strong>Alpine Answers</strong> 020-8871 4656 (<a href=\"http://www.alpineanswers.co.uk\">www.alpineanswers.co.uk</a>) </p> <p><strong>Skiers Travel Bureau </strong> 0113 292 0893 (<a href=\"http://www.skiers-travel.co.uk\">www.skiers-travel.co.uk</a>) </p> <p><strong> Snow Line</strong> 01858 828000 (<a href=\"http://www.snow-line.co.uk\">www.snow-line.co.uk</a>) </p> <p><strong> The Ski Club of Great Britain</strong> information service on 020-8410 2009 (<a href=\"http://www.skiclub.co.uk\">www.skiclub.co.uk</a>)</p> <p><strong> Useful websites</strong><br> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ifyoutravel.com\">www.ifyoutravel.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.liveski.com\">www.liveski.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.1ski.com\">www.1ski.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.iglu.com\">www.iglu.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.skiclub.co.uk\">www.skiclub.co.uk</a></p> <p>The top snowboarding websites are: </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.board-it.com\">www.board-it.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.soulsports.com\">www.soulsports.com</a></p> <p>\u2022 For a review of skiing websites, see Fancy sloping off</p> <p>Are you a beginner, or expert, family or couple?

March and April are warmer and the days longer, but if the snow conditions are variable you need to pick a resort at high altitude where the snow will last. </p> <p>In off-peak periods, many resorts offer free skiing for kids and discounts for lift passes. </p> <p>Family wintersports holidays are a growing share of the market, competition between tour operators is fierce and bargains are plentiful.

Most child-care starts from six months, sometimes four months. There's all-day child care for four- to 12-year-olds, which includes some skiing depending on age. New this season are Mark Warner's (0870 8480 482) \"Teenager Weeks\" for 12-16 year olds and Crystal's one-parent savers.

Most include a 14-day winter holiday, but some do not include snowboarding. If you are going to go tobogganing, off piste or heli-skiing, you may need additional coverage. </p> <p>All major tour operators and ski companies will offer their own insurance, but it is often cheaper to shop around. </p> <p><strong> Insurance specialists</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Douglas Cox Tyrie</strong> 01708 385500 </p> <p><strong> Hamilton Barr Insurance Brokers</strong> 01483 255666 </p> <p><strong> Snowcard Insurance Services </strong> 01327 262805 </p> <p><strong> Ski Club of Great Britain</strong> 020-8410 2000 </p> <p><strong> Columbus Travel Insurance Direct</strong> 020-7375 0011 </p> <p>Hotels often charge a hefty single-person supplement.

  "In the Jerusalem Talmud, the lesser known of the two editions of the classical compendium of Jewish law and lore, the rabbis make a surprising statement. They conceive of God saying of the Jewish people: \"If only they would forsake Me and keep my Torah ...\" While putting practice apparently above faith, the passage continues, \"because the light in My Torah will bring them close to Me.\" <p>A striking reminder of the centrality of the Torah in Judaism, it emphasises that the will of God is found in his revealed teaching, that the words of the Torah are the stairway to heaven. </p> <p>But I think it implies something else of wider significance: that the pursuit of spiritual experience is less important than being part of a collective tradition. It is a message that today seems out of step with the times, as spiritual individualism loosens the hold of organised religion. The right to choose one's own \"path\" scores more highly than submission to group discipline. </p> <p>For Judaism, with its strong emphasis on religious collectivity - the peoplehood of the Jews - the corrosive effects of a culture of personal autonomy are clear. Britain's Jewish population has dropped by a third in under half a century, down to 285,000 at the last count - a mirror of a shrinking diaspora. But the headline figures mask a more complex picture of growing diversity and fragmentation, so much so that the historian of modern British Jewry, Geoffrey Alderman, believes we may be witnessing a \"complete breakdown of communal identity\". </p> <p>The statistical curves do not all head downwards. Synagogue attendance in Britain, for example, has actually risen since the 1960s. Synagogue marriages may have fallen since the 1970s, but the proportion of charedi, or ultra-Orthodox, marriages has climbed from around 8% in the early 80s to 21% now. With their unswerving pietism and their large families, the charedim are seen by many as the guarantors of the future, Isaiah's \"holy seed\" from which the tree of Jewish life will spring anew. </p> <p>The success of the charedim can be used to back up the argument that only the most orthodox forms of faith will prove durable enough to withstand the forces of secularism. From their vantage point, other movements which have compromised with modernity are merely staging posts on the way to oblivion. </p> <p>Conversely, others imagine a kind of pluralist paradise, in which all sorts of Jews may prosper - liberals and traditionalists, Jews who see religion as symbolic rather than supernatural, or cultural Jews, who may read Philip Roth and enjoy a smoked salmon bagel, but who regard religion as purely a matter of personal taste. </p> <p>In which case, the question arises, what will the various groups continue to have in common? Or is Judaism splintering into disparate sects and segments, islands with few bridges between them? </p> <p>To some extent, the answer may depend on the synagogue's ability to remain a central institution. Most British Jews still belong to one. According to the social scientist Stephen Miller, who has analysed the rise in Saturday morning attendances in the Chief Rabbi's United Synagogue - the largest Anglo-Jewish grouping - the figures suggest that many synagogue regulars see it less as a religious institution than as an ethnic club. </p> <p>Even from its earliest days in antiquity, the synagogue was a house of assembly, a communal centre rather than simply a house of worship. The busiest congregations to day can boast a host of extra-curricular activities, from art exhibitions to yoga. Building on this, some envision the emergence of multiplex synagogues, with a social, cultural and educational mix able to appeal widely across the Jewish spectrum. The synagogue would thus continue to be a communal focal point, a magnetic religious core around which different circles of Jews revolve. </p> <p>Attractive as this model might be, there are limits to how far a synagogue can extend itself into a cultural emporium. And the next generation of cultural Jews - if there is a next generation - may be happy simply to siphon off what Jewish content they want from the media or internet, theatre or cinema, without any need to belong to an overtly religious body. Perhaps the kind of unity which Jews may have to settle for in future will be more of a notional, or virtual, one than one crystallised in common institutions - one that still depends on an imaginative link with the Torah. </p> <p> </p> <p> Different perceptions of the written Torah, the five books of Moses, explain the internal Jewish divisions, some seeing it as the word of God; others as a \"divinely inspired\", but composite, work of human hands; others, as national mythology. Nevertheless, the Torah remains the point of common origin. At its root, Judaism is a living commentary on a text, as the Chief Rabbi Dr Jonathan Sacks has said, and so to be Jewish is to be, in some way, part of the commentary - to be part of a textual encounter. </p> <p>A chasidic Israeli who has spent years in a rabbinical academy, will, of course, read the Torah very differently from a postmodern American feminist. There cannot be unison, only a debate over its meaning.

  "When Russell Griffiths arrived at the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside in September 1998 he seemed a pretty cool kind of guy. In his first lecture, he stood up and said \"I'm sure you are as hung over as I am\". After five minutes of teaching, he said: \"Let's just all go back to bed.\" <p>For the 18-year-olds in front of him this was a bit of a laugh. Here they were, fresh out of school and this bloke was swearing in class and encouraging them to bunk off. For a while, they would say \"Russ rocks\" and get a bit of a kick out of him appearing in pubs and buying them drinks. </p> <p>But it was not long before students on Griffiths' course began saying other things about the 36-year-old lecturer. His teaching was erratic and often he would just read out from a textbook rather than prepare a lecture. Then there was the way he would stare at women's breasts, ask them if they had boyfriends and make inappropriate comments. </p> <p>Last Tuesday, Griffiths was acquitted of the rape of one of his 18-year-old students. A jury of six men and six women concluded that his claim that he and the student had been having a three-month relationship and that she consented to sex was true. After its verdict the jury was told that Griffiths had a history of stalking, harassing and humiliating former lovers and that he had a criminal record for it. </p> <p>They discovered he had lied to his employers about his past. And they learned that he kept a little black book of his conquests entitled the Sexual History of Russell Griffiths, containing details of the 90 women he claims to have slept with. </p> <p>Now that the court case is over and Griffiths faces a custodial sentence after he admitted charges of obtaining financial advantage by deception - by signing a de claration that he had no criminal convictions - a picture of him as a serious sexual predator has emerged. </p> <p>It has shocked university authorities who find themselves vulnerable to a lack of legislation which would force staff to reveal their criminal past. Now universities and student unions are urging the government to address the situation. Student leader Verity Coyle said she would launch a campaign to ensure that lecturers undergo the same rigorous checks for criminal history as teachers and social workers. </p> <p>Russell Griffiths was born in Swansea, and studied at a local comprehensive school and later at the city's university. He marriedand had a daughter, and left the two more than 10 years ago. He went on to become involved in a number of relationships - with at least two ending in obsessive behaviour on Griffiths' part. </p> <p>In 1995, Griffiths was given a two year suspended sentence after putting up a poster of a naked former lover in the hospital where she worked. </p> <p>He was convicted of making threats, making obscene communications and criminal damage. In 1996, he was again found guilty of sending obscene communications. Described by his solicitor at the time as \"a very intense young man\", Griffiths had persuaded his fiancee to pose for sexually explicit photographs and when they split up he sent them to her mother, to her ex-boyfriend, and to the university, along with claims that she had been sleeping with lecturers to boost her grades. </p> <p>Griffiths' true background only became clear to the university when a colleague complained to police. Police checks discovered the lecturer's history and a panic alarm was fitted in the female colleague's home. </p> <p>It was not until he had resigned from the university and applied for a reference for a teaching post at another university, that distinct steps were taken to inform pupils that he could be a danger. A week or so after the new term began, the alleged rape victim came forward to Deborah Wilson, another course lecturer. She said that Griffiths had drugged her drink at a disco, taken her home, and had sex with her without her consent. </p> <p>Griffiths' sexual diary marked women's performance out of 10 and had features such as \"best technique\", \"best feature\", \"likes/turn-ons\" and \"what we did.\" Some of the entries were accompanied by explicit photographs. </p> <p>Since he was charged, women associated with Griffiths have spoken of his behaviour. One, Claire Wilkinson, told the Daily Star that she slept with Griffiths at his flat after she went to talk to him about her worries over an essay. She said: \"He led me to his bedroom where he sat on the edge of the bed and talked. I asked if I'd pass and he said 'Yes'. But he failed me.\" </p> <p>Deborah Wilson, a fellow lecturer, said: \"One girl said she was so scared she locked herself in her room for three days and wouldn't go out.\" Yesterday, as students on the university campus mulled over the jury's verdict and watched as the alleged victim got on with her classes, they shook their heads. </p> <p>One woman whom he taught, Lucy Titterington, said: \"It's surprising how many girls who he made suggestive remarks to have come forward. He would turn up at the balls. We knew and took advantage of the fact that he would buy us drinks. </p> <p>\"At one ball he bought me a drink and said that with his personal help I could get very far. He said I was one of the most attractive, intelligent girls that he was teaching. I just thought 'Oh no', this personal help bit was not right. I didn't realise he was using that particular line on everyone else. My friend said he said it to her.\" </p> <p>Another student said: \"I had been doing some work experience in the marketing department and I went to Russell for a bit of advice. He said 'You are going to come across problems all your life because you are tall, attractive and have a big bust'. It was just the way he looked at you, penetrating your eyes. It was totally horrible. And now everyone's feeling a bit naive. Teachers are meant to be safe.\"</p>",
  "Tony Blair will defy Eurosceptic opinion in Britain today by giving conditional support to European Union plans for a charter of fundamental rights on the grounds it will not be legally binding or create new legal obligations for Britain's courts. <p>The European heads of government, holding a two-day session at Biarritz on France's southern Atlantic coast, are determined to move towards a new treaty that both streamlines EU decision-making and boosts accountability before the union's eventual expansion from 15 members to as many as 26 in the coming years. </p> <p>But progress on these big, fundamental issues was slow yesterday, in part because the information meeting cannot produce any definitive decisions. As one diplomat put it: \"Nothing much happened.\" </p> <p>Despite constant Conservative party sniping before the summit, British ministers in Biarritz insisted that a veto on the draft charter of rights - as urged by the opposition - was unnecessary. </p> <p>Instead, Mr Blair's minister for Europe, Keith Vaz, played down the charter's significance yesterday by comparing it to the most unlikely of publications: the Beano. </p> <p>Despite admitting on Thursday that \"all courts will draw upon and look at any documents\" when reaching judicial decisions, he said yesterday: \"People will be able to bring it up in the European Court of Justice just as if it was the Beano.\" </p> <p>Unflattering as that may be, the comparison with a comic has brought pro-Europeans and Eurosceptics into agreement. Thought the charter does not have the force of law like a formal EU treaty, the rivals agree that it is \"part of the process of federalising the EU\" by pushing rights into the EU court of justice's jurisdiction. </p> <p>Mr Blair is not alone in fearing the 54-clause charter, which, after months of wrangling, is due to be agreed at the full Nice summit in December. In yesterday's talks on future reforms, he also confirmed that Britain was filling to reduce its seats on the European commission from two to one. </p> <p>That change is designed to cut commission numbers to manageable proportions as the EU expands south and east. Even the British Conservatives concede that, eventually, no state may be able to have an automatic right to a commissioner. </p> <p>In return, larger states, led by Germany, want more votes on the EU's Council of Ministers to reflect their importance - a move that alarms smaller members. </p> <p>But Labour and at least three other states remain reluctant to concede much ground on a big core issue -- France's suggested streamlining plan, qualified majority voting (QMV). Britain will not abandon its national veto over taxes, social security, defence or future treaty changes, in favour of QMV. </p> <p>Even so, France's minister for Europe, Pierre Moscovici, maintained that \"There is a generally favourable trend on half of the topics to be decided by QMV\". </p> <p>The summit is expected to endorse modest moves towards internal EU reforms aimed at cohesion and effectiveness in EU bodies. </p> <p>But on the rights charterm the Conservatives remained adamant: \"This document is a superstate charter. It will be a major burden on business and a major bind on our independence,\" Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, said yesterday. \"It will give unelected EU judges the rights to impose laws on Britain. This superstate charter must be vetoed.\" </p> <p>There is a real cultural conflict between the traditions of European law and English common law, with the former allowing judges to decide what a treaty or law was intended to achieve while the latter requires them to stick more closely to the text. </p> <p>Eurosceptic claims that the charter will boost the right to strike, protect gay marriage and merely \"respect\" rather than \"guarantee\" press freedom, may seem far-fetched but as Anthony Duff, a Liberal Democrat MEP and expert on treaty law, has said, the consequence of installing the charter is part of the federalising process. \"I think everyone apart from the Brits seems to be quite clear about that,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>October brings many satisfactions. The scents and smells are good: a sharpness from fungi and decaying foliage, and an extra airborne sweetness from flowers that are especially fragrant on the damp air. </p> <p>Among these are certain later-flowering roses, such as 'Perle d'Or' and the China rose, 'Comtesse du Cayla'; great gusts from the sub-shrub, Clerodendrum bungei, with its domed heads packed with little pink flowers; and a number of ginger plants, such as Hedychium forrestii (1.2m), with white flowers above double ranks of smooth, bright green leaves. </p> <p>Most striking of these hedychiums in autumn is H. gardnerianum, with broad heads of yellow flowers and red stamens. That imparts a terrific scent, especially at night, but for most of us it is best pot-grown in a cool greenhouse and then brought to the house or display area just as flowering starts. If grown entirely outside, its flowering is apt to be too late to make the grade.</p> <p>So much is still looking fresh and appetising in the garden. We have worked hard to make this possible, but much of it comes quite simply by choosing and placing plants to their advantage. A slightly tender iris, Iris wattii, is worth growing entirely for its fans of rich green foliage, which are flatteringly presented on a length of stem. We bed that out for the summer in a fairly shady position that we can keep damp. </p> <p>For neighbours, it has other foliage plants with similar tastes: a good crown, self-sown, of the harts tongue fern; the smart-looking foliage and broadly cream- margined comfrey; Symphytum uplandicum 'Variegatum', always best on its second crop of foliage when the first, together with flowered stems, has been cut back; and the lively marginal cream variegation of Vinca major 'Variegata', although that needs a stern cut-back each spring and, if necessary, a check on its territorial ambitions. </p> <p>Just outside this shadow area, we bedded Francoa ramosa (1.2m) for the summer. It has a month-long flowering season, with long, occasionally branching spikes of pure white, four-petalled flowers. Its bright green, wavy-margined leaves are all near to ground level. It is a stylish plant, but not to be trusted outside through the winter. </p> <p>An autumn-flowering plant that really should be known and enjoyed by more gardeners (plenty of nurseries offer it, after all) is Fascicularia bicolor, the only hardy member of bromeliaceae, the pineapple family. Ours makes a low dome on the floor of our sunk garden, but it would be equally at home in a rock garden or at the foot of a wall. The habit of the plant is to make a hummock of evergreen rosettes of saw-edged leaves. When ready to flower, these turn a rich crimson red and open to reveal a central well, packed with a cushion of winking, baby-blue flowers.</p> <p>I hope I have made it sound sufficiently astonishing, not to say unlikely, because it is that. When a rosette has flowered, it is a useless encumbrance and should be sawn out. There is a hardy species of papyrus, Cyperus eragrostis (syn. C. vegetus), that looks its best in a submerged pot at the edge of our sunken garden pool, but it is equally at home in a border. It resembles the popular windowsill umbrella plant, making a series of 0.5m naked stems that are crowned by linear spoke-leaves, these subtending the domed green cushions, which are its flowers. At its best, and preferably as a solo feature, this is an arresting plant, but it does self-sow freely and, if the seedlings are allowed to grow unchecked, can create a confused and weedy impression. All that's needed is a spot of vigilance and control. </p> <p>In the same submerged pot as this cyperus, I have confined the otherwise rather terrifyingly aggressive Houttuynia cordata 'Chameleon'. Under water and controlled in this way, it develops (if in sunshine) its highest colouring, with a maximum of bright pink variegation, some cream and a little green. In a border, it is a rampant spreader and the colouring, especially if a colony is well-fed and not in full sun, can be disappointingly weak. This is a plant that is loved or loathed, and nothing that I write will influence your instinctive reactions. It certainly pays to have a garden that is seldom affected by early frosts. </p> <p>Among the most welcome beneficiaries are fuchsias, whether hardy or more dramatic kinds, that can be stood or planted out for the summer. Fuchsias seem to enjoy cool but not cold weather, and many of those that have tended to be shy-flowering during parts of the summer (often due to capsid bugs) now gather their strength for a tremendous burst of blossom.</p> <p>A perfectly hardy one of great energy that rises vertically 1.3m each year is 'Enfant Prodigue' (Infant Prodigy). It makes pyramids of red-and-purple blossom, though often on some branches and not on others. For its foliage (which is apt to be a weak feature in fuchsias), I especially like 'Tom West', which is of a fairly prostrate habit with bright pink-margined leaves and deep red stems. </p> <p>The colouring is brightest if the plant is confined to a pot and grown in sunshine, but it is bright enough when bedded out for the summer. If you can get the balsam, Impatiens tinctoria, through the winter outside without lifting it (take precautionary cuttings to overwinter under glass), covering the crown with a protective layer of straw or fern fronds in winter, it will be off to an early start the next spring and flower non-stop from June until the first frost. Mine is 2.5m high and carries a succession of large white flowers, the lower lip highly prominent, with a purple centre. They are powerfully night-scented - even obscenely so.</p>",
  "Petrol retailers warned yesterday that the crisis in the Middle East could force UK fuel prices higher, increasing the pressure on the chancellor to offer tax concessions to motorists in his draft Budget at the end of the month. <p>Fresh violence in Israel and the news of the blast at the British embassy in Yemen sent oil prices above $35 a barrel yesterday. They later fell back to $33.85 after the world's largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, signalled that the collapse in Israeli-Palestinian relations would not lead to a retaliatory Arab export ban against Israel's western supporters. </p> <p>The Petrol Retailers Association said that with oil costs at their highest level since the Gulf war, prices at the pump were certain to rise unless the crisis was quickly resolved. </p> <p>\"If prices were to stay above $35 a barrel next week, increases of a few pence a litre are inevitable,\" said Ray Hollaway of the PRA. </p> <p>Analysts warned that the market, already strained by unusually low stocks of spare oil, would stay on the boil as dealers stockpiled supplies to guard against further violence over the weekend. </p> <p>\"The word from Washington is containment. But containment is just not happening,\" said Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Salomon Smith Barney. \"This is a terrible collection of circumstances.\" </p> <p>With four weeks to go before the deadline imposed by fuel protesters for a cut in petrol taxes, lorry drivers said yesterday that some groups were ready to renew the blockades imposed last month. </p> <p>\"There is still very high feeling which we are finding difficult to control,\" John Bridge, national chairman of the Road Haulage Association, said. \"There are people who clearly feel they have to show some muscles on this, but at the minute they accept the fact we have to be able to discuss this with the government under no duress.\" </p> <p>The Treasury minister, Stephen Timms, is to meet representatives from the road haulage industry, farming and small businesses on Monday. Gordon Brown is believed to be considering fuel tax cuts for farmers and hauliers.</p>"
