  "A Rastafarian charged with possessing cannabis with intent to supply has applied to have his case reconsidered under article 9 of the Human Rights Act, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. <p>Rasta Brown made the application, believed to be the first of its kind, at Inner London magistrates court on Thursday. Brown, 38, from Stockwell, south London, originally admitted possession of a class B drug with intent to supply in August and was due to be sentenced when the application was made. </p> <p>Mr Brown's counsel, Rufus D'Cruz, said that although smoking cannabis was not mentioned in the 16 fundamental tenets of Rastafarianism it was considered \"an aid to worship, medicine, and as a source of income.\" </p> <p>The religion's acceptance of it as a source of income would be the basis of Brown's claim that he was not guilty, Mr D'Cruz said. Under article 9 he did not have to establish that Rastafarianism was a religion. </p> <p>\"The right is for freedom of thought, conscience and religion. It is clear from case law that it is a right to be interpreted broadly,\" he said. </p> <p>Judge Charles Gibson deferred a decision on whether the not guilty plea was acceptable. The case was adjourned until November 17.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to the global dance. It started in the late 1980s with Acid House - a simple, hypnotic brand of electronic dance music formed in the underground gay discos of New York, Chicago and Detroit, mixed up with trashy Euro disco on the dancefloors of Ibiza and often enjoyed alongside a new designer drug called Ecstasy. London and Manchester were the first British cities to succumb to it, but nothing this good could stay secret for long: by 1990, there was at least one big dance club in every town in the UK, and the culture was spreading all over the world. </p> <p>Once, only weird kids wanted to dress up and dance all night - now this kind of clubbing is a mainstream leisure activity everywhere: from Tokyo to Telford, Birmingham to Bali. And it shows no sign of ending. The music has evolved, adapted, spun off into endless confusing categories and sub-groups, but the basic premise stays the same: repetitive electronic beats, big smiles, and huge crowds giving it lots of hands-in-the-air abandon. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the clubs have got bigger, boasting massive sound systems and extravagant decor that will shock those of you whose last dance experience was a chrome disco with swirly carpets, a few flashing lights and a mirror ball. </p> <p>In the past decade, major British clubs such as Ministry of Sound, Cream and Gatecrasher have become international youth culture brands, big businesses selling CDs, magazines and clothes and organising parties all over the globe. Our star DJs earn more in one night than some of us do in a year, leading a life many jet-setters would envy: summers in Ibiza or Ayia Napa, winters playing clubs in Australia, South America or South Africa, and regular monthly gigs in New York clubs. </p> <p>The scene is now a huge global business with its own stars, its own social calendar with regular annual fixtures such as the gay mardi gras in Sydney, the Love Parade in Berlin, and the Miami Winter Music conference. It has also bred a whole new kind of tourism - clubbers who travel the world less to see the sights than to experience the nights. This is a guide to some of the club capitals of the world, but search in any big city and you'll find something similar.

  "<p>Before we had even loaded the gear into the canoe, the lake had changed from gentle ripples to heaving troughs, tossing foam into the wind. I was all for unpacking the tents and creeping back into the woods, but my guide Colleen expected me to get onboard and start paddling, so I put on a brave face. </p> <p>It took us six and a half hours to paddle seven miles. There isn't a word to describe how scared I was. It wasn't much comfort to know I had come all this way to find the shack of a long-dead fraud, drunk and serial bigamist called Archie Belaney. </p> <p>When we finally turned into the calm, I felt as though my shoulders had converged into a painful lump at the back of my neck. But suddenly it was worth it, a true wilderness experience, and I could see what had brought Archie all the way from Hastings to northern Saskatchewan to reinvent himself as a Canadian Indian called Grey Owl. </p> <p>When he first saw Ajawaan lake, Archie knew this was the place he was looking for. Here he wrote some of the books that were to make him famous as one of the world's first conservationists. </p> <p>My journey to Ajawaan started at the village of Waskesiu, a pleasant resort with boutiques, restaurants, and one of the most beautiful golf courses in the province. But we decided to forego these pleasures and drove the 15 miles to where the road peters out. There, we parked the car, unloaded the canoe, and were on our way. </p> <p>We began very gently along a quiet little river, the Kingsmere, lined with cat-tail reeds. This peaceful introduction to paddling a canoe was perfect for a first-timer like myself, and I soon got into the rhythm of it. However, once we reached Kingsmere lake, after about a mile and half of paddling, it was a different story - now it was time for some real canoeing. </p> <p>There was also a sense of isolation, of being the only two human beings on a vast expanse of water, the horizon of our destination way out of sight. </p> <p>The lake is 11 miles long straight down the middle. But forget about the middle - the golden rule is stick to the shore line, which makes the journey longer but is much safer. These lakes can be whipped up in a matter of minutes - and you're out of luck if you are caught in the centre. </p> <p>Along the way, we saw bald eagles and kingfishers. Red squirrels scampered along the shore as we pulled in at Northend, the last campsite before reaching the cabin. </p> <p>The campsites in the park are spartan but clean - all campers carry out their own rubbish. There's a place for a fire, a toilet - usually tucked away in the trees - and a raised platform reached by a wooden ladder where food must be stashed overnight, out of reach of the black bears. They look cuddly and friendly, but they are unpredictable and physically powerful. All they think about is food: they will eat anything from a can of beans to a tube of toothpaste. Even lipstick. </p> <p>Through the open flap of my tent, I saw the great sweep of the northern lights and dozed off to the lament of loons - diver birds. Early in the morning, a plume of mist rose through the pale sunshine, rising across the lake like a white rainbow. I heard the howling of wolves in the distance and a dawn chorus of unknown songs from birds with unfamiliar names. </p> <p>We walked the remaining couple of miles to the lake. The sun shone through glades of birch and aspen and the undergrowth was full of rustlings. It was a narrow trail, soft underfoot with moss and leaves, little changed since Grey Owl hauled his canoe along here. </p> <p>The cabin stands by the edge of the lake, surrounded by thick forest. Built from rounded logs with a traditional caulking of moss, it incorporates the beaver lodge from which the building takes its name. The beavers, which often feature in Grey Owl's writings and whom he called \"the wilderness personified\", would enter the one-room cabin from the lake via an underwater entrance. </p> <p>The bed he constructed from stripped pine saplings stands against the wall, as does his blackened wood-burning stove. The cabin is unlocked and unattended, and visitors are free to enter. </p> <p>As we sat on the porch in the sun, the only sounds were the light plop of a fish in the lake, the chatter of the birds, and the scuttlings of squirrels. Up a nearby slope is the cabin built for Grey Owl's wife, Anahareo (real name Gertrude Bernard), when their daughter was born. Close by in a clearing are the gravestones marking the spot where all three are buried. </p> <p>As we set out for the return hike to the campsite, a silver fox walked across the path in front of us; we froze, and he did too, eyes and ears quickly checking us out, then calmly continued on his way, his great silver bush of a tail disappearing into the forest. </p> <p>My trip was by canoe and on foot, as this is how Grey Owl would have travelled, but you can reach the cabin entirely on foot. Park officials recommend taking at least two days to complete the 25 mile round-trip. The trail begins at the Kingsmere river and follows the east shore of Kingsmere, lake alternating between forested pathways and stretches of beach walking. The beaches are fine for sunbathing, but you need to be hardier than me to swim in these northern lakes. They are never warm enough even in the height of summer. </p> <p>About eight miles along the trail is a mineral lick, a good spot to look for signs of moose, deer, bear and wolves. </p> <p>To preserve the wilderness experience, the park has deliberately limited access to the trail. One of the three campsites, Chipewyan, contains only two berths, a double and a single. </p> <p>The Grey Owl trail is a popular attraction, but there's much more to Prince Albert National Park. It spreads over 405,000 hectares (1m acres) in the middle of Saskatchewan and sits on the southern edge of a great forest of spruce, pine, birch and aspen. There are more nesting songbirds here than anywhere else in North America - more than 230 species - elk, badger, lynx, osprey eagle, a flock of rare white pelicans and a free-roaming herd of plains bison. It is also one of the few places left in the world where timber wolves live undisturbed. </p> <p>Grey Owl would be pleased to see that his world remains largely unchanged, and, I'm sure, encouraged by its continuing ability to inspire awe in those who have chosen to follow in his footsteps. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Attenborough's film biography, Grey Owl, opened yesterday.</p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>Canadian Airlines (0870 524 7226) flies from Heathrow to Saskatoon via Calgary for \u00a3461 return.

  "<p>Eighteenth-century antiquaries could not believe that the fantastic natural collection of gritstone rocks and tors at Brimham, overlooking Nidderdale in north Yorkshire, were not the remains of some ancient, long-forgotten civilisation. </p> <p>The pioneer archaeologist Major Hayman Rooke, nicknamed the \"Resurrection Major\" by his contemporaries for his prodigious programme of barrow-digging, actually concluded in a paper presented to the Society of Antiquaries in 1786 that they were the work of \"artists skilled in the power of mathematics\". </p> <p>Inevitably, it was the mysterious priesthood of the Druids who were favoured as the \"builders\" of this amazing natural sculpture park, although we now know that they emerged relatively late on the British scene during the pagan pre-Roman, Celtic period, around 2,000 years ago. </p> <p>The truth is that during the 18th and 19th centuries, just about every freak of nature and prehistoric monument, especially the celebrated stone circles and henges such as Wiltshire's Stonehenge and Avebury, and Castlerigg in Cumbria, were attributed to the Druids. As an 18th century parson commented: \"On no subject has fancy roamed with more licentious indulgence than on the Druids and their institutions.\" </p> <p>So it comes as no surprise to find that many of Brimham's bizarre rock formations were named after those white-robed and bearded priests of the oak groves. There's the Druid's Writing Desk, a flat, table-topped tor which overlooks Nidderdale towards the distant heights of Great Whernside; the Druid's Coffin, a body-shaped crevice; the astonishing Druid's Idol, a massive 200-ton boulder perched precariously on a tiny, 12-inch diameter pedestal; and the Pulpit, which stands awaiting a preacher brave enough to clamber up to its vantage point. And hidden away among the fallen boulders and lacy birches under the rocky escarpment beneath the moor's western edge is the Druid's Cave. </p> <p>The imagination of the early explorers of Brimham's rock garden was not confined to Druidism, however, and other rocks go under such fanciful zoological names as the Sphinx; the Turtle; the Dancing Bear; the Eagle; and the Camel. Some names are more recent: Donald Duck and General de Gaulle. </p> <p>Brimham Rocks are normally reached by taking the minor road north from Summerbridge, and our walk starts from the extensive National Trust car park to the south of the rocks themselves. </p> <p>A broad sandy ride leads fairly directly through the rocks towards Brimham House, originally built as a shooting lodge by Lord Grantley in 1792, but now providing refreshments for visitors and an interesting exhibition that attempts to answer: \"How on earth were these extraordinary rocks formed?\" </p> <p>In simple terms, they are the result of aeons of natural erosion by wind, frost and rain which first exposed and then gradually worked on the weaker joints of the millstone grit rocks to create the amazing shapes we see today. </p> <p>The panorama from the balcony of Brimham House is rightly celebrated, extending from the comical shape of the Flowerpot past the Turtle and Eagle, round to Crown Rocks and the Cannon, pointing menacingly out across Nidderdale. </p> <p>There are hundreds of paths to explore, but be sure that you don't miss the beaked Turtle, which seems to be standing improbably on its hind feet in front of and to the east of the House, nor the Druid's Idol, an extraordinary feat of natural balance that stands behind the House on the northern edge of the moor, close to the Druid's Writing Desk. </p> <p>Once you have exhausted Brimham's wonderland - and you should allow a good hour for this - a pleasant way to explore a little more of Nidderdale is to take the waymarked path which leads north from the rocks, zig-zagging down through the trees past the farmstead of North Pasture to reach the B6265, which is then followed left to reach the hamlet of Fell Beck. </p> <p>From Knoll Top, at the western end of the hamlet, take the path left which leads through the extensive birches beneath Knoxstone Crags and follows the eastern bank of Fell Beck for about a mile, joining the Nidderdale Way to eventually reach the village of Smelthouses. </p> <p>This charming little group of buildings takes its strangely industrial name from the fact that it was once the site of the mills which smelted the lead ore from the Yorke family's mines higher up in the upper part of Nidderdale, where limestone is the dominant rock. Many of the \"highly desirable\" cottages in the village started life as miners' and smelters' houses. </p> <p>After following the minor road for a short distance, turn left following the Nidderdale Way signs onto the beautiful, broad green way known as the Monk's Road. This lovely byway takes its name from the fact that it was used by the white-robed Cistercians of Fountains Abbey, just five miles away to the east, to link with their sheep farms and lead mines in Upper Nidderdale. </p> <p>The Monk's Way climbs steadily through the meadows and back towards Brimham Rocks, which now appear on the horizon ahead, until it reaches the minor road at Maud's Farm. It is now a short walk back to the car park, and perhaps a further exploration of those fascinating rocks. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>Brimham Rocks is about 10 miles north-west of Harrogate, and three miles east of Pateley Bridge, off the B6165 Ripley to Pateley Bridge road. The rocks are reached by taking the signposted minor road north from Summerbridge. </p> <p>The walk described is about 5 miles and should take about three hours, but you should allow at least another hour to explore the rocks. It covers fairly easy terrain, but suitable footwear should be used. </p> <p>The best map of the area is the Ordnance Survey's new 1:25,000 Explorer No 26, Nidderdale, but the larger scale map in the National Trust's leaflet, An introduction to Brimham Rocks and Moor, will show you where to find the featured formations. A convenient pub is The Half Moon at Fell Beck (tel: 01423 711560) but for first-class real Yorkshire ham, egg and chips in various combinations, try the Dry Gill Caf\u00e9 in the Main Street at Summerbridge. </p> <p>The nearest Tourist Information Centre (summer season only) is in the High Street at Pateley Bridge (tel: 01423 711147). Off-season, ring the TIC in the Royal Baths Assembly Rooms at Harrogate (tel: 01423 537300).</p>",
  "<p>The Daily Telegraph considers Chris Woodhead quite a catch. He will probably even be paid for a job he'd have done for nothing. What else can he realistically do? He could write for the Mail but is too much of a snob. The Daily Telegraph is for those who can quote Latin phrases. The Mail is for those who don't know much about Latin but think: \"At least the Romans made the chariots run on time.\" Both papers are for those who mourn the fact that political correctness has outlawed the harmless tradition of owning slaves. </p> <p>I suppose there will be plenty of gravy-train consultancies for Mr Woodhead. Disgraced people usually saunter from one trough to another. He could probably be a European commissioner or win a rail franchise; it is unlikely that he will ever do anything useful. He had the chance to do that when he was a teacher but failed and gave up. The Telegraph, announcing their new signing (who next - Sir Jimmy Savile? Edwina Currie?), says that Tony Blair showed courage in retaining the services of Mr Woodhead in 1997. Er, no. He showed that he is incapable of joy or glee, like a person who wins the lottery but decides to stay on as a store detective. Anyone with fire in their belly and a sense of fun would have summoned Mr Woodhead and told him: \"Chris my boy, I've got big plans for you. I'm setting up a new abattoir watchdog called Offal. You'll get some wellies, a funny hat, \u00a310 a year and your job is to drink the cerebrospinal fluid of cows to make sure it's safe.\" </p> <p>Perhaps cowardice made Blair keep Woodhead on, but it is hard to see what he was scared of, other than a national mood for change. Perhaps he sought to dampen hope as he did when he invited Lady Thatcher to tea. But it seems likely that the main reason for not sticking Woodhead's head on a ruler and parading it through the streets (treason is still a capital offence covering almost anything, and anyway, who would object?) was that there is no gap between New Labour and the Tories on the matter of education. </p> <p>Neither believes that absolutely no one should ever be afforded opportunities that are not the birthright of their class. But both have such a narrow and pessimistic view of human potential that they believe rigorous selection will identify the few who might prove useful to the economic system. </p> <p>So children are tested as young as possible to save time later on. And entry into secondary school increasingly depends on the ability to do puzzles. Puzzles are fine if one is hospitalised, a eugenicist or has Asperger's syndrome. They are the entry requirement for Mensa, that bizarre club for extremely rightwing people who will never be asked to babysit. And I suppose if one wants an ordered society, puzzles are another way of labelling people. </p> <p>Anyhow, when Thatcher moved out of No 10, Blair kept so much of her junk that one could imagine he offered her five quid for the ironing board. So we are left with the grotesque spectacle of John Prescott and Gerald Corbett joshing with each other about rail safety when most of us would like to see the Railtrack board in prison for manslaughter. We see arms contracts fulfilled and renewed. And we see testing continue to replace education. </p> <p>Had Woodhead gone in 1997, he would have long ceased to be a serious nuisance. He might have become one of those people who shamble along the street shouting the c-word but are generally considered harmless. He might have joined Talk Radio, yelling: \"If you like schools so much, why don't you try living there?\" at insomniac callers. He might have been selected as a Conservative candidate. Or he might have gone to the Telegraph early and by now been just another foot soldier among its vast phalanx of \"Am I the only person who mourns the passing of obscure points of grammar and proper respect for St George's day?\" columnists. </p> <p>He might perhaps deny parliamentary ambitions. I distinctly heard him on the wireless saying: \"I am not a Tory.\" I think the rest of us should be the judge of that. He might not be a paid up member but he will have a hard time convincing St Peter he is anything else. I suppose he might be a Melanie Phillips Liberal or a Jack Straw Labourite, in which case, \"Tory\" will do fine, whether as a definition or an insult. </p> <p>Perhaps he means: \"I'm not a Tory\" in the way that a person says, \"I'm not a racist,\" when all their views and actions point to the contrary. If so, he will be very happy at the Telegraph. When Woodhead says that most teachers do a good job, it is obvious that he means something else. When one reads in the Telegraph the sentence: \"The majority of black people are law-abiding,\" it translates as \"Crime's in their blood, so it's a mystery why more of them aren't arrested.\" </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Ireland is becoming a key transit centre in supplying Britain's growing number of drug users with thousands of kilograms of smuggled hashish, cannabis and cocaine, according to an intelligence agency report obtained by the Guardian. <p>Drug smugglers are using yachts, trawlers and cargo ships to land huge quantities of hashish and cocaine destined for Britain and Europe in remote coves and inlets on the west coast of Ireland. Ships make for Ireland's west coast from Panama, Venezuela, Morocco and Pakistan, taking advantage of the lightly policed waters of the Irish Republic in the south west of the country. </p> <p>The report reveals that the Irish authorities are struggling to stop the smuggling and admits that the area chosen is \"nearly impossible to patrol\". The Bere peninsula in Co Cork - thought to be one of the main centres of the smuggling operation - is better known as a remote tourist spot for its prehistoric stone circles, and opportunities for pony trekking and sea angling. It has many small inlets and beaches where drugs could easily be unloaded without detection, only one small port, Castletownbere, and a scattering of villages. </p> <p>Ireland's growing role in drug smuggling is revealed in an intelligence report released by the US drug enforcement administration to the Guardian under the US Freedom of Information Act. The report says: \"Ireland's isolated coasts are ideal for shielding illicit offload operations. The country's internal role as a transit point will accelerate as drug trafficking organisations continue to favour using the island for continental and Britain bound cocaine and hashish shipments.\" </p> <p>It points out that vast quantities of hashish seized in recent years \"point toward Ireland's growing role as a transit point for hashish destined for the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. Hashish shipments are imported into Ireland by recreational yachts or fishing trawlers, often directly from Morocco. </p> <p>\"Once in Ireland, the hashish can be moved more easily to other European destinations, considering Ireland's inclusion in the European Union. According to the US defence attache's office in Dublin, cannabis transited through Ireland also may be destined for North America.\" The report says that ships target Ireland because of the limited role taken by customs, the Irish navy and the Garda to tackle the problem. </p> <p>\"The ministry of justice is proposing legislation that would give naval authorities limited drug enforcement powers. At present, the Irish navy may detain suspect vessels for safety reasons or for fishery protection, but they are not allowed to make arrests.\" </p> <p>The Irish were alerted to the problem in 1995 when the Garda seized over 15,000 kilograms of hashish from a container in Urlingford, Co Kilkenny. The street value of the hashish was thought to be about \u00a316m, and the Garda found it had been brought ashore on the Bere peninsula. The ship involved - known as both the Tropic Moon and the Master Star - came from Pakistan. In November last year customs officials seized a con verted fishing trawler, the Posidonia, off the west Cork coast with an estimated \u00a315m of cannabis resin on board. Three British men were arrested and charged with smuggling offences. </p> <p>The cocaine trade is also growing following a series of seizures in 1996 and 1998. One shipment was only discovered after the trawler - originally from Venezuela - sought the safety of Cork harbour after a storm blew up. The crew of the ship admitted the cocaine had been airdropped to the trawler while she was sailing the Caribbean. The other shipment was discovered in a raid at Kinsale, further along the coast. </p> <p>The growing drugs trade has led the Garda to set up an anti-smuggling operation, sharing intelligence with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and Strathclyde and Dumfries to halt the movement of drugs across the Irish sea to Scotland. Ironically the three biggest successful hauls this year at Stranraer have involved Scottish drug dealers smuggling hashish and ecstasy tablets from the mainland to Belfast. </p> <p>Last night the Garda described the US findings as \"rubbish\". A spokesman said: \"We have had spectacular successes recently in seizing large hauls of drugs which have been shipped to Ireland. We do have an extremely rugged coastline with numerous inlets on the west of Ireland but we don't believe they can be used that easily by boats because of the rough Atlantic seas. We have, however, set up an operation to share strategies to tackle European drug smuggling and are cooperating with police forces in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe.\"</p>",
  "<p> It was The Onion, the online satirical chronicler of America's \"dumb century\", which ran a deadpan editorial entitled \"We need more movies where monkeys give the finger\". An arguable surfeit of such movies, or a suspected cultural climate of cynicism and exhaustion in which they will be increasingly tolerated, is where the fashionable \"dumbing down\" debate applies to the cinema.</p> <p>In many ways it is obtuse to fling accusations of \"dumb\" at Hollywood or individual Hollywood products. After all, isn't film a populist art? Haven't its most glorious and compelling works derived their brilliance from their creators knowing what a mass audience wants? Doesn't the energy and exuberance of their work depend to some degree on their exclusion from the simpering civilities of high art? </p> <p>Brilliant films come off the Hollywood production line all the time. But the dangers of dumb reside not merely in the kind of movies made, but the way they have come to be distributed, exhibited, criticised and understood. Hollywood's colonisation of world markets and national cultures is now all but complete, and like all colonisation, depends on a degree of collaboration with and admiration - covert and overt - for the victor. (With some honourable exceptions, the British lottery-funded film has unfortunately become a byword for dumb, with many a substandard script taken out of the bottom drawer to take advantage of the cash bonanza, with the presiding authorities now apparently seeking to redeem the situation by aping the American industry.)</p> <p>This is not simply a naive matter of political correctness or art-buff snobbery, of believing that Hollywood is always schlock or that there is no such thing as a bad Iranian film. Some quintessentially bad films can be middlebrow art movies saturated with their own sense of superiority.</p> <p> Rather, it is a question of vitality, variety and choice. Repertory cinema, where serendipitous discoveries can be made, is disappearing in favour of multiplex conformism. Increasingly, the work of film-makers like Kiorastami, Ozu, Fellini, Bergman, Ray, Powell and Antonioni is omitted both from what we can see on the big screen and from any discussion of cinema's history.</p> <p>As far as postwar Hollywood is concerned, a distinctively political case for the prosecution on the dumbing charge focuses on the terrified response to the McCarthyite bullying of the early 50s. This capacity for cowardice and self-dumbing is alleged to have resurfaced in the 70s with the Spielberg-inspired trend for \"juvenilisation\" of the movies. In the 80s, Hollywood president Ronald Reagan concealed his native shrewdness in favour of projecting a down-home, aw-shucks innocent who invoked Rambo in support of US interventionism, a Hollywood archetype who attained his apotheosis in the insidious Forrest Gump - whose moral superiority lay in his low IQ. And in the 90s, Paul Fussell identified \"dumb\" movies as the summer blockbusters subservient to their own hype: movies which take up less cultural space than their publicity. The apogee of this species of dumbness is the calamitous The Phantom Menace.</p> <p>Even in this Hollywoodised context, moreover, Hollywood seems not to have a history now. A creeping amnesia is setting in. Gilbert Adair suggests that cinephilia, as it is conventionally understood, has given way to a retail ubiquity of movie images, denuded of history and context. Put simply, students have posters of Marilyn Monroe with her skirts billowing round her waist, but how many can name the movie from which that image is taken? </p> <p>The other factor is the explosion of movie discussion on the web. This is in one way a thrilling, historic democratisation of film criticism. Now the old adage \"everyone's a critic\" is literally true. The one-party state of critical journalism is broken: anyone can publish their views on the net and get a global readership for them. </p> <p>But there is the gloomy question of quality control: critical discourse is supplanted by anorak fan-speak and chat-room argument. The giant Internet Movie Database has become a wildly popular reference resource all over the world, but as it is managed by Amazon.com with an eye to marketing its videos and DVDs, it entrusts its \"plot summary\" for each film to any punter who cares to file one, on the basis, presumably, that the customer is always right. </p> <p>But there are anti-dumbing forces ready to promote the cause of what, a little reductively, is known as World Cinema. The dynamism of Bollywood challenges the Los Angeles hegemony and acts as an antidote to dumbness and uniformity. Then there is the inexorable growth of festival culture: already, the Martell Tour of French Cinema is very popular and has led to French movies being picked up for distribution.

  "<p><strong>1950s</strong></p> <p>1950 <strong>Sunset Boulevard </strong> (High) <br>The sour underside of Hollywood's self-mythologisation, with Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond immortalising the generation of silent-film stars cast aside by the sound revolution of two decades before. Billy Wilder's acid-dipped movie was arguably the first successful essay in biting the hand that feeds, and initiated a film-about-film-making micro-genre that encompasses everything from The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) to The Player (1992).</p> <p>1952 <strong>Singin' in the Rain</strong> (Low) <br>The anti-Sunset Boulevard, if you will. Set on the cusp of the silent movie era, it's an uncomplicated celebration of the burgeoning sound film era. Hollywood inspects itself, and comes up smelling of roses.</p> <p>1955 <strong>Blackboard Jungle </strong> (Low) <br> Hollywood faced up to the sudden appearance of the teen generation (The Wild One, with Brando, was a year earlier; Rebel Without a Cause, with Dean, the same year). It reacted with admirable cynicism: Blackboard Jungle is the first proper rock'n'roll movie, packaging a series of tunes around sledgehammer attempts to connect with the teen audience. It's an approach that's barely changed since, for over the decades teens - and their likes and dislikes - have formed the movies' most crucial demographic.</p> <p>1958 <strong>A Bout de Soufle</strong> (High) <br> Landmark first entry in the French new wave - directed by Godard, story by Truffaut - whose obsessive recycling of movie iconography blazed a trail in cinema's appreciation of its own cultural influence. </p> <p><strong>1960s</strong></p> <p>1960 <strong>Psycho </strong>(High and low) <br> The hitherto genial master of suspense shocked his legions of fans when he turned thoroughly nasty, and ushered in a new form of cinematic terror. The sick-in-the-head killer has since formed one of cinema's most reliable earners, but there were risks for the film-makers too. Michael Powell's Peeping Tom was released the same year, and virtually ended his career overnight.</p> <p>1960 <strong>La Dolce Vita </strong> (High) <br> Fellini's cautionary parable of the moral emptiness at the heart of Italy's postwar economic miracle centres on the cult of celebrity and its function as an all-pervasive social lubricant. In the movie that gave us the word \"paparazzo\", gossip columnist Marcello Mastroianni is a ruthlessly etched metaphor for the parasitical habits of a society enthralled with its own media. </p> <p>1964 <strong> The Gospel According to St Matthew </strong> (Low) <br> A heartfelt rendering of the sacred text from Marxist director Pasolini, which remains one of the most accomplished extrusions into cinema of the politics of ethnography. </p> <p>1964 <strong>A Hard Day's Night </strong> (Low) <br>The teen-oriented movie took a second giant step with the Beatles' first cash cow which is something of a pop-culture masterpiece, thanks to director Richard Lester. Its mix of music and unforced self-referentiality became a template, the Spiceworld movie being its most recent manifestation.</p> <p>1967 <strong>Bonnie and Clyde </strong> (High and low) <br> Breakthrough antiheroic fable that established European new wave practice in Hollywood. As the eponymous bank-robbing partnership, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway helped explode the thematic straitjacket of mainstream cinema and pioneered the use of aestheticised violence.</p> <p> 1969 <strong>Easy Rider </strong> (Low) (pictured) <br> The underground went overground with Dennis Hopper's cheaply shot biker movie. As an ode to freedom, its cultural place became thoroughly compromised, especially as its most memorable tropes were rapidly absorbed into the music video industry.</p> <p> <strong>1970s </strong></p> <p>1970 <strong> MASH </strong> (High) <br> Elaborate response to the first war to go out live on TV, Vietnam, recast as a black comedy set in the bloodsoaked chaos of a military hospital in an earlier one, Korea. Altman's verit\u00e9 camera style echoed both documentary-film practice and the low-budget looseness of the European new wave; a conflation that would reach its height a decade later in Apocalypse Now, as camera crews are filmed filming an assault.</p> <p> 1971 <strong>A Clockwork Orange</strong> (High and low) <br> Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Burgess's parable expertly points up the symbiotic relationship between high and low culture: Malcolm McDowell is the boot boy whose depravities are inspired by, and scored to, everything from Beethoven to Arthur Freed. The response-conditioning processes of Alex's therapy are key instances of the debate over violence and its relationship to media and society.</p> <p>1972 <strong>Deep Throat </strong> (Low) <br>Possibly the grubbiest moment in the history of cinema's cultural wars - a hardcore porn movie which became a mainstream hit. </p> <p>1975 <strong>Jaws </strong> (Low) <br>As the Hollywood auteur generation began to run out of steam, one of their upstart compadres blew them all out of the water - by inventing the event movie. Hollywood was never the same again.</p> <p>1976 <strong>Network </strong> (High) <br> Bitter attack on TV's power to dilute and eviscerate, marking a shift of the movies' cultural assault from self-flagellation to a new enemy. Peter Finch is the newscaster who threatens to kill himself on air, Faye Dunaway the marketing executive who's prepared to sacrifice everything for ratings. Prefigures The Insider (1999) in its indictment of the broadcast media.</p> <p>1978 <strong>Superman </strong> (Low) <br>As cinema's financial horizons began to expand after Jaws and Star Wars, new sources for inspiration began to open up. Christopher Reeve's version of the Man of Steel hit gold, and a marriage between the movies and the most frowned-on of all literary forms - the comic - was cemented.</p> <p>1980 <strong>Star Trek: The Motion Picture </strong> (Low) <br>A new step forward in cross-media partnership. TV, as Network had demonstrated, was the movies' enemy; now it could become their friend. The first Star Trek movie, playing on the loyalties of the fans of a long-cancelled TV show, was by no means a sure-fire proposition. Its success, however, led directly to a string of sequels.</p> <p><strong> 1980s</strong></p> <p>1980 <strong> Raging Bull</strong> (High and low) <br> Martin Scorsese's ode to embittered masculinity via the psychotic nobility of Jake LaMotta was the last genuine masterwork of Hollywood's auteur generation - it exited with a precise layering of cinematic mythology and representation, as De Niro/ LaMotta invokes the ghost of Marlon Brando/Terry Malloy in a culture-conflating final scene.</p> <p>1982 <strong>First Blood </strong> (Low) <br> The first Rambo movie - the character that became the brutal exemplar of American machismo during the 80s, and in many ways defined the low culture of the era.</p> <p>1986 <strong>Top Gun <br> Low </strong> <br>Another cross-media operation: Tony Scott lifted images directly from his own car commercials to power the Tom Cruise fly-boy vehicle.</p> <p>1986 <strong>She's Gotta Have It </strong> (High) <br> The rise of African-American cinema in the 80s radically changed the movie landscape. Lee's literate, quickfire debut film specifically rebutted the hitherto unchallenged assumption that blaxploitation - low culture cinema of the most impressive kind - was the only African-American genre that could survive, and ushered in an entire generation of film-makers.</p> <p>1989 <strong>Batman<br> Low</strong> <br> Hollywood crossed a line with Batman: the first time that a movie earned more through merchandising and licensing than through box-office receipts. Hence the Hollywood conventional wisdom that films are simply loss leaders for the toys.</p> <p> <strong>1990s</strong></p> <p>1991 <strong>Reservoir Dogs<br> High and low</strong> <br> Cinema's modern obsession for recycling pop culture started here - literally in the opening scene, when a crew of stick-up artists deconstruct Madonna's Like a Virgin. Tarantino's film destroyed at a stroke the equation of genre cinema with low culture and, displaying a dizzying breadth of cinematic reference and film-making dexterity, singlehandedly proved that populist forms could be made to work in the service of the most high-minded of propositions.</p> <p>1993 <strong>Jurassic Park </strong> (Low) <br> Spielberg's warning on the dangers of reality-manipulation, accomplished, ironically, with the finest live-action CGI yet seen. </p> <p>1994 <strong>Three Colours Red </strong> (High) <br> A landmark less for its content than for its defeat at the hands of Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs follow-up Pulp Fiction for high culture cinema's most sought-after prize, the Cannes Palme d'Or. Kieslowski's last film, and the closing part of a trilogy much admired by an embattled European cinema, its failure at Cannes demonstrated the comprehensive cultural hegemony of American independent cinema in the 90s.</p> <p>1994 <strong>Dumb and Dumber </strong> (Low) <br> The film that excited cultural commentators across the globe into bringing the phrase \"dumbing down\" into general circulation. The Farrelly brothers' comedy, with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, was universally reviled on its release (most notoriously, it was savaged by a TV panel who hadn't even seen it). The Farrellys, however, had the last laugh when they hit box office (and low culture) gold with There's Something About Mary. </p> <p>1995 <strong>Toy Story </strong> (High) <br> Animation has always been Hollywood's quiet money-maker, but few Disney products achieved thematic sophistication equal to their ground-breaking computer-generated animation. Both a Hans Christian Andersen-esque fable of toys coming to life, and an elegiac tribute to the disintegration of classical cultural virtues.</p> <p>1996 <strong>Scream <br>High and low</strong> <br>A Tarantino-esque reclamation of cinema's scuzziest genre - teen slasher movies - given a sophisticated treatment that acknowledged its unwritten rules and structural robustness. The high point of postmodern cinematic wit.</p> <p>1997 <strong>Boogie Nights <br>High and low</strong> <br>Twenty-five years after Deep Throat, hardcore pornography became fit subject matter for one of America's cutting-edge highbrow film-makers, Paul Thomas Anderson. An ambitious, auteurist depiction of two decades of porn, Boogie Nights marked the climactic reversal of the symbiotic relationship between high and low cinema culture.</p> <p>1998 <strong>Shakespeare in Love <br>High </strong> <br>America's cinematic Anglophilia reasserted itself as period literary films surged in popularity. Financed in the US and a multi-Oscar-winner, Shakespeare in Love harnessed the talents of stage veteran Tom Stoppard in a comic spoonful-of-sugar treatment of the literary establishment's eternal touchstone.</p> <p>1998 <strong>The Truman Show </strong> (Low) <br> Maybe the relentless upward drive was getting to Hollywood: LA's king of low-culture movies, Jim Carrey, became the conduit for an easy-access meditation on the pitfalls of a director's power.</p> <p>1999 <strong>Being John Malkovich <br>High </strong> <br>Cult of celebrity viewed though an MTV perspective - directed by music-promo prankster Spike Jonze. With Malkovich himself in the lead, Jonze and his screenwriter Charlie Kaufman created a densely layered commentary on society and cinema's obsession with itself.</p> <p>1999 <strong>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace </strong> (Low) <br> The current champion of low-culture cinema, destroying all comers. Sitting on a franchise that has renewed itself with reissues, special editions, prequels and sequels, George Lucas is the single figure most responsible for Hollywood's current configuration. Whether that's a good or bad thing is what this debate is all about.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday's intervention by the European Central Bank looked high risk from the outset. By the end of the day, it looked plain cavalier. On the plus side, there was the virtue of real surprise and, unlike September's action, the ECB was in the driving seat. The background was more favourable, too - with a handful of stats over the past fortnight hinting at a cooling of the runaway US economy. </p> <p>So the near-two cent jump in the euro which followed the first bout of market action in the morning looked a justifiable result. The trend, for once, seemed to be the ECB's friend. </p> <p>It is all the more alarming then that by lunchtime all the gains had evaporated and the currency was back below the level at which the ECB had first intervened. Even a second bout of action in the afternoon struggled to hold the price much above this level. </p> <p>What neither the markets nor anyone else could work out was why the bank did not ensure a bigger bang for its (apparently modest) amount of bucks by waiting until after next week's US presidential election, when the Federal Reserve could have helped out. Add in a rise in rates and the ECB's approach might then have amounted to a classic exercise in central bank intervention. </p> <p>A November rise in interest rates remains a possibility - though how that would square with the need to address the imbalance of economic performance between the US and the euro-zone, which has driven the dollar higher (and the euro lower) is not obvious. But any sign now of the US cavalry will look like a rescue mission. </p> <p>Indeed, there was room to speculate yesterday whether the ECB acted on its own because it knew it could not get the Fed on board even after the election. </p> <p>That is unlikely. Instead, the ECB seems to have jumped at a chance to raise its credibility - and missed. The danger now is that it faces a lonely war of attrition which can only compound the worries about price stability the intervention was designed to address. </p> <p><strong>Bankers' spat</strong><br> </p> <p>Merger or takeover talks which leak in their early stages usually do so as a negotiating or scuppering tactic by one of the parties. The leaks can be costly. </p> <p>For instance, Peter White, the chief executive of Alliance &amp; Leicester, found out just how difficult it can be to negotiate in public when news of his talks with Bank of Ireland reached the outside world prematurely. He eventually lost his job. </p> <p>Ian Harley, chief executive of Abbey National, and Peter Burt, his counterpart at Bank of Scotland, must be hoping that they too do not suffer a similar fate after news of Abbey's approach to the Edinburgh institution emerged late on Thursday. </p> <p>Long misunderstood by the City, Mr Harley was at pains yesterday to make it clear he wanted to get BoS back to the negotiating table. But his chances looked far from bright last night, unless Mr Burt is only talking tough and is secretly ready to reconsider his terse official statement - itself reminiscent of the hostility he adopted during his ill-fated bid for NatWest a year ago. </p> <p>To be fair, the leak had done neither Mr Burt, in New York for personal reasons, or Mr Harley much good by the end of the day. BoS, the smaller of the two operations, had been forced to acknowledge that in the summer it tried to instigate a deal with Abbey, which it would have liked to portray as a \"merger\", allowing the BoS men to take the top jobs. Failure leaves Mr Burt in the uncomfortable position of having two abortive deals out in the public domain, a factor which will make it all but impossible for him to argue that he sees a rosy independent future for his bank. </p> <p>But it is Mr Harley who is probably in the more precarious position. Unlike Mr Burt's shareholders, his appear to be showing fewer signs of patience, despite a track record which is nowhere near as bad as some critics make out. His own contradictory statements have done him few favours and the rise in his bank's share price showed yesterday that the City believes that his approach to BoS will flush out another bidder. </p> <p>Analysts at Deutsche Bank note that, while the deal he wants to pull off is \"reasonable,\" better ones are available and for that simple reason they believe it is unlikely to happen. </p> <p>Mr Harley's proposal, which contains only the loosest of terms and had not yet touched on boardroom positions or even the price to be paid, is still on the table. But to get BoS back talking he may have to indicate that the word \"takeover\" be restricted to its accounting sense rather than a more general usage which would mean dumping the Edinburgh management. </p> <p>Such a route could also require Mr Harley being brave enough to relinquish his own position as well. Indeed, his big shareholders might require it of him - either that, or a predator makes it academic.</p>",
  "For weary motorists it was a case of once bitten, twice shy. While the prime minister spent the day telling people not to panic, drivers across the country ignored him by spending the day queueing at forecourts. <p>The rush to top up tanks reached near-farcical levels with one driver queueing for only 56p worth of petrol, according to the AA. </p> <p>Motoring organisations joined oil companies and the government in a plea to keep calm. But there was little sign of a let-up in demand as garages across the country ran dry and others were besieged by queues. </p> <p>Oil companies tried to play down the threat to petrol supplies by the upsurge of up to 60% in daily sales and claimed they were resupplying most dry garages within 24 hours. The absence of blockades was still allowing daily resupply, they maintained. </p> <p>The RAC said some motorists had been trying to get round shortages by mixing diesel and petrol in their cars or trying to run cars that use lead replacement fuel on unleaded petrol. \"They will face bills totalling thousands for a new catalytic converter. Some people are being unbelievably silly,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p>Tempers started to fray. In Eastbourne, East Sussex, a motorist was arrested after allegedly assaulting a security guard at a Tesco's filling station. </p> <p>The queues were replicated across large areas of the country with snaking lines of traffic spilling from forecourts on to roads in Greater Manchester, Merseyside, London and Glasgow. </p> <p>Fife police issued a warning after long queues built up at petrol stations. Drivers fearful of the consequences of a new blockade were told their actions were causing shortages. A police spokesman said: \"Panic buying is putting an abnormal strain on fuel supplies.\" </p> <p>Peter Brill of the RAC said although fuel supplies from refineries remained uninterrupted, panic buying was leading to fuel droughts. </p> <p>Devon and Cornwall's assistant chief constable, Ian Latimer, spoke out following reports of hundreds of people buying petrol cans. One army surplus store sold 300 jerry cans to a single customer. \"It is causing us concern, especially with bonfire night weekend approaching,\" he said. </p> <p>The emergency services warned motorists there was a legal limit to how much fuel could be stored: up to 15 litres at home and 10 litres in a car. </p> <p>London's overstretched road network was badly hit in some areas by the rush to the pumps. </p> <p>The manager of a BP garage in Finchley, north London, said: \"It was absolutely mad. People were putting \u00a350-\u00a370 worth of petrol in their Range Rovers and then filling up two or three jerry cans as well. It was pure greed.\" </p> <p>He took a delivery of 36,000 litres on Wednesday afternoon and virtually all of it had gone within 24 hours. By yesterday, he was forced to conserve the remaining 3,000 litres for ambulances and police vehicles who regularly use the garage. </p> <p>A Shell petrol station in Muswell Hill, north London, was forced to close on Thursday night after panicking drivers blocked the road by attempting to join the queue from all angles during the evening rush hour. </p> <p>Motorists in the north west, where the previous fuel blockade hit first, began joining queues late on Thursday and headed for the forecourts again yesterday. </p> <p>John Ashton, regional director of public health in the north west, warned of the consequences of further fuel blockades. He said September's pickets had been devastating. </p> <p>During the last fuel crisis, he said family doctors, district nurses and health visitors could not keep up with their full quota of home visits. Operations were cancelled and patients could not attend out-patient clinics. Meals on wheels and other vital services provided by the voluntary sector and local authorities faced major disruption. </p> <p>\"Taxi drivers who move blood supplies between hospitals could not get petrol and the firm that removes environmental waste from hospitals throughout Greater Manchester reluctantly had to withdraw its services.\" </p> <p><b>Cans and Can'ts</b><br></p> <p>Motorists who hoard more than the legal limit of petrol face fines of up to \u00a35,000. </p> <p>The Petrol Spirit (Motor Vehicles) 1929 law restricts people from storing more than two 10-litre metal containers and two 5-litre plastic containers of petrol in garages. It was updated in 1982, as metal containers were replaced by plastic. </p> <p>The containers must be kept in structures separated from living space by a wall and a door that is able to resist fire for half an hour. </p> <p>Approved containers can be bought from hardware stores. Containers are required to have a screw-cap or closure to prevent the vapour of liquid escaping.</p>",

  "Kenneth Clark, that quintessential arts mandarin, was booed as he entered the dining room of the Athenaeum in 1954. Whatever could have possessed the assembled judges, bishops, dons, civil servants and others to boo one of their own? The reason was his recent appointment as chairman of the Independent Television Authority - the regulator of the new commercial channel that was to bring an end to the BBC's monopoly. The clubmen were expressing their outrage that money-making should be allowed to invade a cultural domain, albeit a \"popular\" one. <p> The episode is significant precisely because the medium in question was television, the greatest single transformer of cultural life since 1945. The transformation took place with remarkable speed. In 1946 there were only 15,000 TV licences, mostly in London; by 1956 there were over 5 million, and pretty much the whole country could receive transmissions; by 1960 this had doubled to 10m, and by 1969 nine out of 10 households had a television. Clark himself did not possess a television at the time. In its early days, it was understood that television was a medium principally watched by the lower orders: television, Noel Coward explained with camp magnificence, \"is for appearing on, not watching\". </p> <p> But the potential of TV quickly became clear. Indeed, Clark himself was to become one of its great beneficiaries, especially as the presenter in 1969-70 of a 13-part BBC series simply called Civilisation. Civilisation here meant the high art and music of western Europe, and Clark made clear that he thought culture in the present was going to the dogs. The barbarians were now well inside the gate in cultural terms, and as Clark crisply put it, \"popular taste is bad taste, as any honest man with experience will agree\".</p> <p> Clark's manner of social grandeur was part of his authority in this role, and in measuring the distance travelled in Britain's cultural journey over the last half-century or so, perhaps no change has been more important than the loosening of the connection between social status and cultural authority. There are, necessarily, elites who exercise disproportionate power in most areas of social and cultural life, but there are now a far greater variety of such elites than 50 years ago, and, crucially, they are much less likely to overlap, still less to form a series of concentric circles. Concomitantly, the notion of a single hierarchy of cultural forms now has to coexist with a much more pluralist acceptance of a diversity of equally legitimate cultural activities. At the beginning of the 21st century, even the distinction between \"high\" and \"low\" culture no longer works. For many people under 30 today, the ministry responsible for the most significant part of their cultural life is the Ministry of Sound.</p> <p> This expansionist narrative partly rests on a shift in the sense of \"culture\" itself. As Stuart Hall, doyen of that form of sociology-plus-street cred that has become known as \"cultural studies\", influentially put it: \"Culture not as a body of work, or particular media, or even as a set of ideal standards and rules, but rather as lived experience, the consciousness of a whole society; that peculiar order, pattern, configuration of valued experience, expressed now in imaginative art of the highest order, now in the most popular and proverbial of forms, in gesture and language, in myth and ideology, in modes of communication and in forms of social relationship and organisation.\"</p> <p> In the middle of the 20th century, Britain was, numerically speaking, still overwhelmingly working class. And it was a highly class-conscious society, with class identities recognisable at a glance and strong patterns of deference governing relations between classes. Half a century later, inequality and exploitation may be no less pervasive in British society, but an enormous rise in general prosperity and an accompanying change in social attitudes mean that the rigid pyramid of the class structure no longer corresponds to the lived experience of daily life in the way it once did. </p> <p> The seeds of this change were sown in the 40s, a decade which saw the working class register substantial gains in their standard of living and their political influence. The second world war had the greatest impact here, rescuing large swathes of the population from the long night of un- or under-employment and disturbing many of the assumptions of service and subordination on which prewar social relations had been based. But although the radicalising experience of the second world war, the confidence and bargaining power which full employment gave to the working class, and the consequent electoral triumph in 1945 challenged the established social order, it is important to remember just how little cultural radicalism there was among Labour's leaders (apparently Attlee \"suffered acutely if the port was circulated the wrong way at his dinner table\"). </p> <p>Nonetheless, the social changes consequent upon greatly increased prosperity were highly visible in the ensuing decades. One of these was the rise of what was called the \"affluent worker\": a long period from the late 40s of full employment and rising real wages meant that the average manual worker and his family were enjoying a much greater level of prosperity than ever before. A second change is what was called \"the embourgeoisement of the working class\". This was not just a matter of increased prosperity, but a fundamental change of identity. It involved repudiating the old self-consciously separate, fatalistic, working-class stance, and adopting broadly middle-class attitudes and ways of life, including saving and the pursuit of upward social mobility, as well as the development of more individualistic and self-interested political allegiances. </p> <p> Contributing to this blurring of class identities, the decades of postwar prosperity brought vast new markets into existence, and the technological innovations which responded to these markets introduced a greater diversity of cultural media. The development of commercial television after 1954 is an obvious example; the multiplication of radio stations, at first in the form of \"pirates\", is another. And the phenomenon of the \"pop star\" - the new celebrities of the 50s and 60s - would have been impossible without widespread ownership of record players. What records were to music, the paperback was to books, leading to what one might call the Penguinification of British reading. Paperback publishing had been in its infancy in the 40s, but in the course of the 50s the whole commercial exploitation of this medium was transformed: from selling a few hundred thousand copies in total, Penguin's sales rocketed to the point where in 1959 alone they sold 12m paperbacks. The 60s saw an even more extraordinary expansion, and by 1968 their annual sales had risen to 29m.</p> <p> These large sales were the fruits of new marketing strategies which skilfully exploited the potential links between different media. The success of John Braine's Room at the Top illustrates this trend. It appeared as a hardback, with accompanying newspaper serialisation, in 1957; it was published as a paperback in 1959, and in the same year, crucially, it appeared as a film. A sequel and a television series came later. Critics of the expanding cultural forms complained of \"Americanisation\", as the great engine of capitalism exploited new markets, but this can also be seen in terms of a diminished deference towards Europe as the traditional home of inherited culture. Increased national self-assertion in other parts of the British Isles could be seen as loss of deference towards the internalised values of Englishness. In the spaces thus opened up for groups, most notably ethnic groups, to assert their demands for recognition and dignity, public respect for distinctive forms of cultural self-expression has partly functioned as compensation for lack of political and economic power.</p> <p> But the disorienting speed of such social and technological change generates nostalgia, and nostalgia can sometimes seem to have been the dominant ethos of British culture since the 70s. Evelyn Waugh, John Betjeman and a host of costume-drama producers have fed this appetite for self-definition through loss. At its core is the self-indulgence involved in revelling in the defeat of the stylish and the graceful by the harsh realities of the functional, the effective, the modern. The result is the psychological or cultural mechanism by which sheer pastness confers a charm, the frisson of irrecoverability, the pleasures of longing. Things not in themselves particularly beautiful, things considered the height of new, functional vulgarity when they first appeared, come to seem the quintessence of a more lovable age. Think how this has happened to 19th-century terraced houses, or to 30s cinemas, or to 50s railways, and so on. Culture is regarded as something that happens elsewhere, and in England the elsewhere of choice for many people is the past.</p> <p> As a result of these complex, dislocating changes, much contemporary cultural debate consists in trying to pick one's way between, on the one hand, an embattled nostalgia expressed in ill-directed cries of \"dumbing down\" and, on the other, a knee-jerk cultural correctness that locates virtue exclusively in whatever can be claimed to have been previously neglected, marginalised or, best of all, suppressed. In this situation, bewilderment and indifference disguise themselves as relativism and tolerance. But abstaining from making cultural judgments is not necessarily the best way to show respect for other people's differences: that can be simply to hand control over our lives to the unsleeping drive of capital to maximise its returns. </p> <p> We are, by and large, very pleased with ourselves about the distance we have travelled from a world dominated by the values of the Athenaeum dining room circa 1954, and to express our self-satisfaction we rush to damn all that we suspect still belongs to that world by calling it \"elitist\". The elites represented there have indeed lost much of their prestige, but the elites gathered in boardrooms have thereby only increased their power. The complacent and intolerant attitudes on many issues of those who took their social and cultural superiority for granted half a century ago may indeed be part of a world well lost - but those muted boos were not altogether wrong in identifying the force that would transform British culture beyond the powers of even the Kenneth Clarks of this world to regulate it. </p> <p><b>Kenneth Clark on St Paul's</b><br></p> <p>\"In spite of the awkwardness of imposing a Roman elevation on to a gothic plan, [Wren] has achieved areas of such refined and inventive detail as to make St Paul's Cathedral the chief monument of English classicism.

  "President Robert Mugabe's supporters have embarked on a fresh wave of farm invasions. More than 100 farms were occupied this week, while the 1,600 farms already hosting squatters have witnessed increased levels of violence. <p>According to witnesses, eight people have been seriously assaulted, some knocked unconscious, including both white farmers and their black staff. So far, police have not tried to stop the violence. In Glendale, northern Zimbabwe, officers have grabbed land for themselves, witnesses said. </p> <p>Mr Mugabe and senior ministers have been blamed for encouraging the new wave of invasions and for inciting violence. Mr Mugabe said last week that he would revoke the racial reconciliation offered to white Zimbabweans in 1980. He threatened to try Ian Smith, the former leader of Rhodesia, for war crimes with other whites who served in the armed forces under him. </p> <p>Cabinet ministers and provincial governors have urged supporters of the ruling Zanu-PF party to \"settle themselves on farms\". Ignatius Chombo, chairman of the land resettlement committee, said the government did not have enough transport to resettle them in an orderly way so they would have to do it themselves. </p> <p>\"The statements were incitements to violence on the farms,\" said Jerry Grant, deputy director of the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents 4,200 mostly white, large-scale farmers. \"We've seen an immediate response in the form of more aggression, more threats and more beatings. Death threats have been issued all over. Whether or not the policy of reconciliation has been withdrawn officially, it is happening on the ground.\" </p> <p>On Monday, Dave Jenkins was hurt when he was hit on the head by one member of a 100-strong mob intent on settling on his farm in Glendale. Mr Jenkins said the group arrived in eight vehicles, including a police Land Rover, led by the Mashonaland provincial governor, Elliot Manyika. </p> <p>\"I tried to explain to them that my farm has not been listed [for compulsory acquisition for resettlement] but the governor would not listen,\" said Mr Jenkins. \"The crowd got ugly and one of my neighbours was hit on the head with an iron bar. Armed police just stood by.\" He said the situation was getting dangerous and feared someone could be killed. </p> <p>Mr Jenkins and his wife have stayed on their farm to witness scores of squatters plant maize and cotton in their fields. </p> <p>\"We will get a court order today or tomorrow telling the people to get off our land,\" he said. \"I don't think it will make any difference, but we must try. It is like the impeachment motion against Mugabe in parliament: it may not stand much chance of passing, but every possibility to change this situation must be pursued.\" </p> <p>Mr Mugabe's land policies have been criticised in a draft United Nations report. According to yesterday's Zimbabwe Independent, the report claims that there is \"no coherent land reform plan\" that can be supported by the international community. </p> <p>The newspaper said the UN draft report claims that provincial governors are directing the farm invasions, often in breach of Zimbabwean law. The UN team included experts from Chile, Brazil, Kenya and Jamaica. </p> <p>The already tense atmosphere in Zimbabwe is set to intensify next week when the supreme court considers a case brought by white farmers against Mr Mugabe and other ministers who say the president's land policies are unconstitutional because they deny farmers and their staff police protection and compensation. </p> <p>Mr Smith's return from Britain on Tuesday is expected to inflame the situation further. But Mr Smith appears to be relishing the prospect of a joust with the government.</p>",
  "<p>Lloyd's of London was yesterday cleared in the high court of orchestrating an elaborate fraud in the 1980s designed to avert the collapse of the huge insurance market. </p> <p>The decision followed eight months of arguments and a 10-year legal wrangle over claims that Lloyd's had duped investors who were encouraged to join the market without being told about billions of pounds' worth of outstanding insurance claims.</p> <p>More than 200 investors, known as \"names\", argued that they were fraudulently recruited to become the market's financial backers when senior executives knew that liabilities were soaring. Up to half of the \u00a38bn losses related to claims for asbestosis, mainly from the US.</p> <p>In his ruling, which ran to 600 pages, Mr Justice Cresswell said there was insufficient evidence to prove that Lloyd's actions amounted to a case of fraud. But the judge added that the incompetence of the professionals who operated in the market was \"staggering\" and the names were innocent victims of their failings. He also pointed out that many names were unable to pay their debts because they had been unable to recoup losses from firms that advised them or from the \"errors and omissions\" insurance scheme operated by Lloyd's to cover losses incurred by members.</p> <p>Lloyd's, he said, should be more conciliatory towards the names and recommended an independent review body be established to consider each case.</p> <p>\"It is high time that the Lloyd's litigation here and overseas came to an end,\" he said. \"The hostility between the names and Lloyds was evident throughout the trial.\"</p> <p>But last night the dissident investors, many of whom face bankruptcy, vowed to fight on and said they were prepared to take their case to the European court of human rights.</p> <p>Sir William Jaffray, the lead name, estimated the losses suffered by each of the 230 names stood at \u00a35m and hinted they would be seeking compensation in excess of \u00a31bn.</p> <p>\"There will be no surrender to Lloyds whatsoever,\" he said. \"We will certainly look at an appeal and it may end up getting settled in the European courts. We are determined to negotiate proper compensation for our names and we believe we have been defrauded despite the judge's announcement today.\"</p> <p>Sir William insisted the judgment had failed to exonerate Lloyd's and had left the company \"covered in mud\".</p> <p>\"The scale of loss and damage is quite horrendous,\" he said. \"People have sold homes and businesses in the mistaken belief they were underwriting genuine losses. What we need now is some tough fraud-busting legislation and the very fact that Lloyds can continue in business after this is a national disgrace.\"</p> <p>Nick Prettejohn, chief executive of Lloyd's, said he was delighted the court had thrown out the claims and denied there had been any attempt by Lloyd's to defraud names.</p> <p>He commended the judge for making a distinction between the lack of competence of \"some people in the market and the efforts to improve regulation by Lloyd's\".</p> <p>Mr Prettejohn said he would consider the judge's recommendation to set up a review panel but hinted that Lloyd's might reject this and continue to pursue names for the outstanding debts.</p>",
  "Yasser Arafat plans to fly to Washington for talks with President Bill Clinton, the Palestinian leader's senior negotiator said yesterday after meeting the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright. <p>Saeb Erekat said in Washington that Mr Arafat had issued two public statements calling for an end to the violence in Israel, \"[and now] we want to see the United States exert every possible effort on the peace process. </p> <p>Despite the truce, clashes continued yesterday, but in Jerusalem Israelis returned in droves to the main market the day after a car bomb carrying 10kg of explosives killed two people. </p> <p>\"This is part of our life here, and we have to go back to our routine,\" Vered David said as he negotiated the crowded lanes of Mahane Yehuda market with carrier bags full off pastries. </p> <p>As both sides buried their dead and political leaders prayed for the strength to resist retaliation, two more Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Nevertheless, Israeli and Palestinian officials were hopeful that this ceasefire, the official announcement of which was cancelled after Thursday's car bomb, would hold. </p> <p>They were also unusually conciliatory. \"Despite the shooting and the clashes, I know that there are attempts, and there are intentions from the Palestinians to bring calm to the territories,\" the Israeli prime minister's security adviser, Danny Yatom, said. </p> <p>\"I am sure that in the coming hours, in the coming days, we will see more effective at tempts and we will see better results,\" he told Army Radio. </p> <p>Yasser Arafat's negotiator Nabil Shaath was also positive. \"We are doing our best. It is much calmer today in Gaza than on any day before.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile mourners gathered in the south-western suburbs of Jerusalem for the funeral of Hanan Levy, a lawyer, killed by Thursday's car bomb. The other victim, the daughter of a politician with a large following of Jewish settlers, was buried on Thursday night. </p> <p>In the village of Hizme, to the north-east, the funeral of a young Palestinian followed the familiar ritual: the coffin draped in a Palestinian flag surrounded by hundreds of mourners, slogans and stone-throwing, and then gunfire from Israeli soldiers. </p> <p>Within hours another teenager from Hizme was dead. A second Palestinian was shot dead in the West Bank city of Tuklarem. </p> <p>As on every Friday for the past six weeks, the violence began at the end of afternoon prayers, as marchers headed towards Israeli army positions. At Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, and Bethlehem, Hebron and Ramallah in the West Bank, events unfolded according to the same pattern. </p> <p>In the Old City of Jerusalem there was relative calm, largely because worship was once again restricted to women and men over the age of 45. </p> <p>If this truce is to succeed, this pattern must be broken. \"We still have a list of martyrs who are dying now in intensive care units. If tomorrow there will be a funeral, after that for sure the funerals will go to the clashpoints, and [they will throw] stones, and the soldiers will shoot them with real bullets, and the circle will continue,\" said Hussam Khader, who leads Mr Arafat's Fatah militias in the West Bank city of Nablus. </p> <p>\"But if Israel takes its forces away from the entrances of Palestinian cities, and forces settlers not to attack Palestinian civilians, we can talk about a ceasefire. </p> <p>\"The problem is we have two forces on both sides: the settlers and the soldiers for Israel, and the police and the people for the Palestinians.\" </p> <p>As ever, the question remains whether Mr Arafat is able to rein in people who are determined to avenge their horrific lossesand the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, will resist pressure to retaliate for the market bombing. On Thursday night his cabinet gave the ceasefire 24 hours to produce results. </p> <p>\"This time I think we will see something new,\" Mr Khader said. \"The traditional type of uprising - demonstrations and stones - this will disappear in time, within two or three days. But maybe we will hear about attacks by the settlers, and attacks by the militias on soldiers and settlers.\" </p> <p>If Mr Khader is right the region is heading towards a war of attrition: a low-intensity conflict punctuated by daytime bombings in Israel and night raids on the Jewish settlements in the West Bank. </p> <p>\"If people have guns and attack settlements, then it is easy for them to destroy the ceasefire,\" he said. </p> <p>\"If Mr Arafat calls for a ceasefire and the new generation of Fatah agrees with him - not the traditional leaders - then he will achieve this. But if the people in the refugee camps say they do not want to accept it, then who has the power to impose a ceasefire? No one.\"</p>",
  "Gordon Brown will announce an increase in the basic state pension of at least twice the rate of inflation as the government seeks to repair the damage caused by last year's 75p a week increase. <p>The Treasury refused to comment on the chancellor's plans, but speculation in Whitehall last night was that the increase could be \u00a35 a week for single pensioners and \u00a38 a week for a couple.</p> <p>With the Treasury feverishly attempting to massage down expectations of the size of the government's budget surplus, Mr Brown intends to concentrate on Labour's priorities rather than the demands of fuel protesters.</p> <p>One source said last night that Wednesday's announcement would be generous and, while increasing the basic state pension, would provide extra help for those on the lowest incomes.</p> <p>The increase is intended to bridge the gap until the introduction of the new pensioner tax credit in 2003, but Mr Brown will also uprate the minimum income guarantee to around \u00a390 a week for the 2m poorer pensioners.</p> <p>The chancellor will speak to the prime minister over the weekend to finalise plans, but he is determined to put the bulk of any extra spending into helping pensioners rather than a big cut in fuel duties.</p> <p>Help the Aged said a \u00a35 increase would do much to undo the damage of the 75p rise. But the National Pensioners Convention, led by Jack Jones, said it would still press for the restoration of the link with earnings.</p> <p>By law the basic state pension should rise in line with inflation by \u00a32.25 for single pensioners and \u00a33.60 for couples.

Senior Treasury officials yesterday described recent City forecasts of \u00a320bn or more as \"overblown\".</p> <p>Mr Brown is likely to justify the lower projections by arguing receipts from corporation tax and capital gains tax will be lower than City expectations.</p> <p>In an extract released from a speech he is due to make to the Confederation of British Industry on Monday, Mr Brown stressed he would not repeat the \"mistakes of the past\". \"We are not going to seek easy and short term solutions, abandon the inflation target, relax our fiscal discipline or reach for quick-fix or easy solutions. We are going to stick the course,\" he is expected to say.</p> <p>The chancellor's cautious approach was reinforced by the prime minister yesterday when he said that he would not squander the budget surplus with unsustainable tax cuts.</p> <p>He said it would repeat the Tory mistakes of the 1980s if the government blew the surplus after working so hard to remove the deficit and get debt under control.</p> <p>He pointed that in 1998-99 the Conservative government ran a fiscal surplus of 1.4% of GDP. \"By 1992-93 that had turned into a deficit of 7.8% of GDP, a massive turnaround of almost 10% of GDP in four years.\"</p> <p>Apart from a drive to cut the 35% productivity gap between British and American workers, the pre-budget report will also focus on new help to revive the inner cities, including relief for regeneration in brownfield sites.</p> <p>The chancellor is also expected to announce details of a new community investment tax credit to encourage private investment in underinvested communities and a community development venture fund with matched funding from the government.</p>",
  "Channel 4 has been criticised for using real criminals in a violent film about the underbelly of Britain's inner cities. <p>Instead of actors, a cast made up largely of convicted criminals will star in Shooters, to the anger of victims' groups.

  "<p>Two little known entrepreneurs have proved that you do not need to appear on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? to make \u00a31m out of a game show. </p> <p>A former GP and a club comedian who came up with the original format for the BBC's new hit, The Weakest Link, are being paid \u00a34,500 for every edition broadcast. If the show continues for a year - even allowing for breaks - they could pocket more than \u00a31m. </p> <p>Even if it does not, the pair will probably become millionaires when the show is sold abroad. The BBC announced yesterday that more than a dozen foreign broadcasters were queuing to buy it. </p> <p>Fintan Coyle, a former GP in south London, came up with the idea for The Weakest Link with his friend Cathy Dunning, a comedian who has developed a number of light entertainment programme formats. Although the show's presenter, Anne Robinson, has embarked upon a whirlwind publicity round, the creators have been kept in the background and said nothing. Dr Coyle was not at home yesterday. </p> <p>Their programme, which has evolved considerably from the original idea, has proved a remarkable hit in the early evenings on BBC2, where it appears daily. It is now enjoying a peak time \"champions' league\" run on BBC1. </p> <p>Its appeal stems from the format which demands contestants work with each other to \"bank\" as much cash as possible, but then forces them to vote out one of their number at the end of each round. The \"weakest link\" endures the sharp end of Robinson's tongue, and exits along a \"walk of shame\" to be interviewed, Big Brother-style, backstage. </p> <p>The BBC has been using the show in the ratings war against ITV. When it made its BBC1 debut earlier this week, the programme drew almost 8m viewers. On Thursday night, when it went head-to-head with Millionaire, it scored 6.3m and pulled Chris Tarrant's show back to 9.2m, its lowest rating this year. </p> <p>BBC1's controller, Lorraine Heggessey, is said to be delighted with The Weakest Link's performance. A celebrity edition and a \"losers' league\" are now being considered. </p> <p>BBC Worldwide could generate as much as \u00a330m for the corporation, with more than a dozen foreign broadcasters registering an interest in the show's format. </p> <p>Colin Jarvis, BBC Worldwide's head of programmes and operations, said foreign presenters would have to maintain the tone set by Robinson. \"Foreign broadcasters are mesmerised by Anne.

  "<p>One of England's newest islands lost another metre of privet hedge and gravel drive to the river Ouse yesterday as dinghies manned by veterans of the Mozambique floods kept a lifeline open in the village of Naburn, only four miles from central York. </p> <p>\"It may look a bit cosy after Mozambique,\" says Paul Wooster of the International Rescue Corps, as his dinghy drifted past two tubs of geraniums and a garden gnome, \"but we're getting worried about pollution - drains backing up and an awful lot of stagnant water about.\" </p> <p>Mr Wooster's dinghy service is now the only way in to Naburn. Passengers on the boat's circuit include Christine Hirst, clutching frozen shepherd's pies. \"Social services have sent them for us to deliver to anyone on their own or in difficulty,\" she says. The village is used to floods but not since 1947 have they been so high or so long. </p> <p>\"Luckily we all know one another,\" says Mrs Hirst. \"Except maybe for Milly - she was only born on Friday.\" The island's newest inhabitant has had a check-up visit from a health visitor also marooned on the island, where a baby boy was born a few days earlier </p> <p>Four families have moved out after problems with power cuts, even though Yorkshire Electricity is one of the local flood heroes.

  "A man was ill with suspected Ebola fever in southern Uganda last night after he helped to nurse a patient who died of the deadly haemorrhagic fever last week, health officials said. <p>In the north, where the epidemic erupted in September, two more people died overnight. The death toll now stands at 84, and 267 people have been infected. </p> <p>Geofrey Kabango, a 27-year-old prisoner on parole, was looking after sick prison inmates and soldiers at Mbarara University hospital when he was taken ill on Thursday. </p> <p>Among the patients he was helping to care for was Samuel Bandese, 20, an army private who had recently moved from the northern town of Gulu, the heart of the epidemic, to the army barracks at Mbarara, about 50 miles from the border with Tanzania. </p> <p>Bandese was the first person outside the Gulu area to die in the present Ebola epidemic. </p> <p>Sam Okware, the commissioner for health services, said international health officials were in Mbarara with their Ugandan counterparts to examine all hospital staff and people in contact with the two men. </p> <p>The officials say they are confident that efforts to control the spread of the virus will not be derailed. </p> <p>\"Any case of Ebola worries us, but government and other officials have been very good,\" Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation's surveillance and response unit said. </p> <p>\"We found that a limited number of people came in contact with the infected person in Mbarara. The response has been rapid enough.\" </p> <p>The fatality rate has been lower than expected: less than 40% of those who have contracted the disease have died, and 141 of those infected have been discharged from hospital.</p>",
  "The IT industry is perceived as a particularly open industry where race is not an issue. Look around most IT departments and they are invariably made up of a diverse workforce. But take a closer look, and it often becomes apparent that white IT professionals are the ones who are making it to executive positions of authority. <p>Rene Carayol is a man who's made it. Formerly the managing director of IPC Electric, the 42-year-old is now chief executive of an e-business consultancy. Yet he says he is still shocked by the amount of racial prejudice that he comes across and how it affects his career. \"When I go to new offices with my team, receptionists instantly turn to a member of my team to see who is the boss,\" he says. </p> <p>\"At IPC Electric, many of the suppliers didn't expect to be working for a black IT director and they had to get used to working with me. It took some time.\" </p> <p>Carayol thinks it took him longer to get where he has in the IT industry than it should have done, because of the colour of his skin. \"I found that I stayed a junior for what appeared to be a little too long. It is a persistent complaint that I hear from ethnic minority people. It's taking minorities longer to reach top positions than it should.\" </p> <p>Sarabjit Ubhey, head of operational control at Bupa, thinks institutional racism has to be at the root of it. \"People expect racism not to be an issue in IT because it's a new industry,\" she says. \"But the so-called glass ceiling seems to be there as there are so few senior non-white IT people. The numbers don't match up and that shows there is an issue. </p> <p>\"The fundamental problem is awareness. For example, my team has a very diverse make-up. There are a couple of Muslims and people from other parts of the world. As a manager, if I am organising an event I have to make sure I don't arrange things that will exclude some of them. For example, if I invite </p> <p>A lot of networking goes on at work social events, and if someone is not party to that interaction, it could mean they are missing out on opportunities. </p> <p>Paul Riddell, the Commission for Racial Equality's (CRE) head of legal strategy and private sector in London and the South, says one of the most common complaints from people who approach the CRE is that they feel excluded from these networks and that this has hindered their career progression. </p> <p>Riddell agrees it is the responsibility of managers to make sure people are not being excluded. \"They shouldn't use the informal stuff as a forum for career advancement,\" he says. \"Instead, </p> <p>Some companies have support groups for ethnic minority groups. While these can be a good forum, they can also have the negative effect of compounding a \"them and us\" situation. </p> <p>Some companies have also appointed diversity managers. But Carayol thinks companies should not need to employ a diversity manager: \"Diversity should be on every manager's list.\" </p> <p>The more role models that non-white people have, Carayol says, the easier it becomes for them to progress up the career ladder. The good news is that he thinks it has already begun. </p> <p>\"Get a couple of people through and it opens the floodgates. The race issue is in the same place as women were 10 years ago. It is taking longer than I expected and it is more painful, but it has started to change.\"</p>",
  "<p>The safety of the maize which the government hopes will be Britain's first commercially grown GM crop was last night in question after independent scientists checked corporate research and found that the animal food had a \"suspicious\" trend of killing chickens. </p> <p>Steve Kestin and Toby Knowles, who have worked on chicken studies for the Ministry of Agriculture, were commissioned by Friends of the Earth to review a study by Aventis, the giant GM company, supporting its case to grow the maize in Britain. </p> <p>The scientists, from the University of Bristol's department of clinical veterinary science, told a government hearing yesterday that they had found \"a failure to investigate suspicious trends\" in the death of chickens. </p> <p>Ten male broiler birds out of 140 (7.14%) who were fed the GM maize in a small trial died compared to five (3.57%) who died after eating conventional maize. </p> <p>This, they said, suggested \"either a fault in the study or a real direct effect of diet and should act as a spur for further investigation\". </p> <p>The Aventis study stated that the level of deaths was \"normal for this fast growing strain of bird\" and gave a normal mortality rate in broiler chickens of this age at \"between 5 and 8%\". </p> <p>But a source in the British poultry industry said yesterday this range of deaths was abnormal -\"4% is the average. Anything over 5% and you have got a problem\". </p> <p>The Bristol scientists also questioned the methods and conclusions of the Aventis study. </p> <p>They said that the nutrition tests done by the company on the maize were \"inadequate\" and \"not of a standard that would be acceptable for publication in a scientific journal\". </p> <p>They further found the studies had not been repeated sufficiently to be of scientific validity. Only four repeats were used, as opposed to the minimum of 14 which they recommended. </p> <p>Using such a small number of tests, they said, would be \"one of the best methods _to show no effect\". They also noted other flaws in the design of the Aventis study. </p> <p>\"It's astonishing that this study has not been assessed and found wanting by the government, and that it's been left to Friends of the Earth to have it properly reviewed.\" said Dr Kestin. </p> <p>During the hearing experts have already questioned Aventis's scientific evidence for the marketing of the GM forage maize. </p> <p>In particular, they have expressed concern over the failure to test the GM maize on cows for which the maize is intended. Aventis has refused to produce evidence at the hearing. </p> <p>Earlier this week, the Ministry of Agriculture said that the official tests on the Chardon LL crop, carried out by the French authorities, had only been conducted for one year rather than the two required under EU law. </p> <p>Yesterday's revelations were a further blow to the government's GM policy. </p> <p>In April, it announced its intention to allow Chardon LL - which has been genetically modified to be resistant to Aventis' own herbicide - to be put on to the national seed list, the final legal barrier before the seed can be sold to farmers. </p> <p>But a loophole in the law found by Friends of the Earth allowed the public the right to an ppeal against the decision. </p> <p>A spokesman for Aventis last night said: \"We are confident that Chardon LL is a variety eligible for entry on to the national list, having already complied with all of the prescribed relevant regulatory procedures.\"</p>",
  "Vermont is used to being in the vanguard: it was the first place to outlaw slavery; first to grant the vote to every man. <p>But earlier this year it set itself apart in another way, and one that it is finding difficult to accommodate. Its fewer than 600,000 people are alone in giving gays the right to the next best thing to marriage. </p> <p>If it is true that all politics are local, then it is especially true in Vermont. It is not a great prize for Al Gore - who is likely to win it - or George W Bush, delivering only three of the 270 electoral college votes needed to elect the president. Nor is there much interest in either candidate. </p> <p>Considerably more likely to encourage participatory politics are Ed Flanagan and Karen Kerin. </p> <p>Mr Flanagan, 49, is the Democratic candidate for the US Senate, the first openly gay Vermont official - he is state auditor and if elected he will be the country's first openly gay senator. </p> <p>Ms Kerin, born Charles Kerin 56 years ago, is thought to be the first transsexual to run for Congress. She has received no financial support from her party, the Republicans, and not much more from the voters, putting her on about 9%. </p> <p>Their posters are all over the state. A more cryptic injunction, at least to outsiders, says: \"Take Back Vermont.\" </p> <p>Richard Lambert, the dairy farmer who has sold more than 5,000 of these posters at $5 each, says: \"It's immoral to me, period. We didn't go and shove it down their throats, what we thought [of them]. Don't come and shove it down our throats that that's an acceptable lifestyle.\" </p> <p>This was the first test of opinion since the Vermont civil union law, which allows gay couples to share inheritance rights, home ownership, health insurance, and tax returns, became law in July. </p> <p>Mr Flanagan, asked to define the line between civil union and gay marriage, made an 0 with forefinger and thumb: a matter of semantics, he said. </p> <p>But while this puckish Democratic lawyer, well to the left of the Clintonites, would be delighted be the first openly gay senator in Washington, he considers the reaction against civil unions an irritation. </p> <p>Rather than discuss that, he wants to challenge the iniquities of the American healthcare system, the power of vested interests and lobbyists in Washington, and retraining for the middle-aged. </p> <p>In any case, he believes that Vermont will eventually grow to accept its most recent unique distinction. \"They're still going to be able to drag girls home. They won't start having fantasies about men.\"</p>",
  "They call this the ground war, and never has the phrase seemed more apt, not only because in recent days the parties have been deploying their activists like shock troops. There is also an awful lot of talk about guns. <p>In the white working-class neighbourhoods of Detroit and other industrial centres, the unions are performing their traditional election task of mobilising the Democratic party's core supporters - calling workers to remind them to vote, distributing pamphlets and driving people to the polling station on election day. </p> <p>This year, more than ever before, their adversary in this street-level battle of brawn is the National Rifle Association (NRA), the gun lobby. </p> <p>The NRA is providing committed activists to man the banks of Republican phones, and even more importantly, it is spearheading an assault on one of the Democrats' exposed flanks, the white working class, which in states such as Michigan includes large numbers of fanatical hunters. </p> <p>When Charlton Heston, the NRA's figurehead, came to Michigan to declare the election \"the most important since the Civil War\", half the people at his rallies were wearing union jackets. </p> <p>An advertisement, funded by the gun manufacturers, running in Michigan in recent days shows an anonymous man in white shirt and tie dismembering the American flag with a scalpel. The message is clear: once the liberal elite take away the Second Amendment, which arguably guarantees the right to bear arms, there will be no stopping it. </p> <p>Tim Hillebrand is your Democratic nightmare - a working-class Democrat born and bred, who has this year turned NRA organiser in Motor City. </p> <p>\"I've been a union member since I was a teenager. I've never voted Republican before in my life,\" said Mr Hillebrand, an assistant nurse in a psychiatric hospital. </p> <p>But now he feels his right to own a gun is under greater threat than ever, with a series of control measures, (to close loopholes in the background checking, for example) awaiting congressional approval </p> <p>\"There has never been such a fierce, anti-gun energy in this country,\" he said, pointing to some proposals which would require gun-owners to carry a licence bearing a photograph. \"It's like having to have a licence to write a book or to go to church. This is more important than union stuff. This is about the interpretation of the constitution.\" </p> <p>Paradoxically, the struggle over guns has not emerged as a core issue in the national campaign, precisely because it is so sensitive and crucial in swing states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania. </p> <p>Many Democrats wanted Al Gore to make more of George W Bush's gun record - he backed a bill in Texas making it permissible to carry concealed weapons in public buildings including churches and schools. But he soft-pedalled on the subject, aware that a strong anti-gun message would weaken the bedrock of his working-class support. </p> <p>While Bill Clinton focused on winning voters in the centre, Al Gore's campaign has reflected a return to the Democratic fold, with a populist message delivered in class terms. </p> <p>The principal influences behind this approach have been the Democratic pollster, Stan Greenberg, who was banished from the Clinton court but who is now back in favour, and America's Forgotten Majority, a book published earlier this year and taken very seriously by Democratic strategists. </p> <p>The authors, Joel Rogers and Ruy Teixeira, argued that the white working class had not disappeared, as the Clintonites appeared to assume, but was \"the key to the 21st century politics\", accounting for 55% of the voting population. </p> <p>Only half of this bloc hold blue-collar jobs, but the book makes the case that the rest, in low-paid clerical and service jobs, have working class incomes and lifestyles, and have seen their living standards stagnate and even decline during the \"Clinton boom\". </p> <p>\"These people are the real swing voters in American politics. Their loyalties shift the most from election to election and, in so doing, determine the winners in American politics,\" Rogers and Teixeira said. </p> <p>In Detroit, Jim DeLuca is trying to hold the line for the Democrats among the city's 350,000 trade unionists. He is an official in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and for the past week has been running a phone-bank. </p> <p>He and five other electricians sit in a grey soulless room, making their way through lists of fellow union members, asking for their vote. </p> <p>\"Al Gore doesn't want to take away your gun,\" he tells the doubters, reciting a slogan from the campaign literature. \"But George W Bush wants to take away your union.\" </p> <p>\"We ask you to look at what's good for all labour. Not just your family issues, but what organised labour has done for you in the last eight years,\" he added. Electricians are one of the groups who have done particularly well in Detroit as a result of a construction boom. </p> <p>They have been earning from $70,000 to $100,000 (\u00a348,000-\u00a369,000) a year, and the members Mr DeLuca calls are still overwhelmingly loyalists, yet with a Democratic lead in Michigan of only a few points, he is nervous. </p> <p>Ralph Nader, the Green party candidate, is drawing away 5-10% of union members. Mr DeLuca estimates as many as 25-30% are flirting with the NRA and the Republicans. </p> <p>He, and most Detroit unionists, believe Michigan's 18 votes in the electoral college will be decided on election day. Mr DeLuca and his wife will be on duty. But so will Tim Hillebrand. The 2000 ground war may yet be settled over the barrel of a gun.</p>",
  "Some of us involved in psychotherapy and counselling suspect that the current sexual abuse scandals among the clergy are only the beginning of what is to come. <p>Instead of concentrating on devising even more elaborate forensic selection procedures and tests for clerical candidates, which I am sure have their uses, I doubt if anything really beats the extended clinical history-taking, concentrating in depth on psycho-sexual development. Given the power of the sexual drive, I fear the committed paedophile will always try to find a way of getting at his or her sexual targets. </p> <p>However, trying to think beyond the present crisis to the future of the church prompts consideration of possible structural changes to address the underlying issues, and make the church a place in which sexual abuse of children is made much less likely. I do not think it can be eradicated; I have seen no evidence that paedophilia is more prevalent among the clergy than the general population. </p> <p>The churches are also obsessed with gay and lesbian issues - indeed with sex in all its aspects. Recent anecdotal speculation from the United States suggests a much higher proportion of gays among the clergy than in the general population. Who knows? With the present, Vatican-generated witchhunt against gays and lesbians, it is hardly likely that gay priests in the closet will feel safe to come out and face their own particular Gethsemane. </p> <p>I take it as axiomatic that women have to be ordained to the diaconate and priesthood. The presence of women priests will have a beneficial impact on men priests, and perhaps help begin to restore the laity's increasing wariness in male clergymen's contact with children. The Vatican's ban on even discussing the subject of women priests makes me profoundly sad, as does the reluctance of priests to make public views they keep to private conversations for fear of reprisals from Rome. </p> <p>The link between priestly vocation and compulsory celibacy is clearly not necessary, even if it is the present norm in the Latin church. Given our human need for emotional contact with, and containment by, others, should we not now be encouraging those with a vocation to celibacy to be grouping themselves together in religious communities, however small? </p> <p>We are fortunate in having a long tradition of monastic practice and wisdom. I am very concerned about the long-term corrosive impact of clergy living alone, and not having to face the destructive side of our natures, which can erupt in close living with another person or people. The eremitical vocation is, I believe, rarely found in trinitarian Christianity, and certainly not among the secular clergy. </p> <p>There are presently a number of worrying trends. I am concerned about the growth in numbers of candidates for the priesthood who seem to exhibit rather rigid personalities and have a penchant for ultra-conservative theology, pre-Vatican 2 liturgy, and dressing up. I suspect some of these people are sexually immature or confused, and are running away from their sexuality by immersing themselves in the idea of an all-male priestly caste. </p> <p>The priesthood has always attracted its more than its fairshare of odd balls and misfits. That has been one of its glories. What I am concerned about, in an age in which sexuality is increasingly questioned, is that those who are confused and deeply unhappy with their sexual orientation use a celibate priesthood as a way of running away from their internal confusions. </p> <p>Priesthood is, inter alia, about service to others; sexually and emotionally insecure priests are little use to the laity. But people do not have to be sexually active, or even experienced, to be emotionally secure. </p> <p>If clergy who do not a have a vocation to celibacy are, or want to be, in committed, long-term relationships - with either a woman or a man - should we not be encouraging them to do so? With the ordination of former Anglican married priests, we now have, in this country, living proof that a married Catholic priesthood works. </p> <p>We must all know at least one no-longer-active Catholic priest living with, or married to, a woman. Can we not be grown up enough to see that gay (and lesbian, once women are ordained) priests, who do not have a vocation to celibacy, should be encouraged to be in stable, faithful, lifelong relationships that parallel heterosexual marriage? </p> <p>One of the challenges to the church is to devise effective pastoral support and liturgies for same-sex couples, lay or ordained, who want to commit themselves publicly to each other in the presence of God and his people, and to receive a blessing. God only knows that in such a homophobic society as this, lesbian and gay people need all the help we can get. </p> <p>Lastly, the whole issue invites us to consider more deeply the nature of Christian ministry, lay and ordained, in societies with rapidly declining numbers of priests. A useful place to start is by reading Mark Jordan's The Silence Of Sodom: Homosexuality In Modern Catholicism (University of Chicago Press, 2000). It is not an easy read, nor is it just about homosexuality, but it provides an invaluable background to understanding the deeper reasons why we are in a mess over clerical sexual abuse. </p> <p>Radical? I hardly think my proposed administrative arrangements stand comparison with the really challenging imperative for metanoia in the gospel of Jesus Christ. They are merely suggestions so that the Kingdom of God may be lived and preached more effectively. </p> <p>Dr Bernard Ratigan is a psychoanalytic psychotherapist working in the NHS in Nottingham.

  "<p>A painting of the London to Chester mail coach in the 1870s hangs behind the desk of John Roberts, chief executive of the Post Office. On the shelf below it is a model of its modern counterpart, a Royal Mail train. </p> <p>Mr Roberts, a history graduate, is proud of the Post Office's past. But the train makes the point that the Post Office is \"a business looking forward\". It is also a reminder of one of the more immediate problems awaiting his attention: what to do about the mail which is being delayed by Railtrack's decision to impose speed restrictions in parts of its network. </p> <p>About 25% of mail is transported by train. \"We are very dependent upon the railways and on running times. When moving mail from one end of the country to the other, an extra half hour makes a great difference to us. We will have to look at whether we have to transport more mail by road, which is not something we would not want to do.\" </p> <p>The danger is that late trains will lead to late deliveries, which will damage the Post Office's reputation as it is enters a new age of competition. </p> <p>Mr Roberts, 56, believes his lifetime career at the Post Office has prepared him well for the new age. He entered the civil service as a high flyer under the university entrant scheme. He was then offered two jobs, one in the Post Office and the other in the Ministry of Agriculture. If he went to the Post Office, he was told, his civil service career would be short-lived because the organisation was about to become a public corporation. </p> <p>He was not deterred. He joined the Post Office, where his father, a career civil servant, had worked as a middle manager for six years. During his early days Mr Roberts worked for the chairman, Sir William Ryland, who was overseeing the change in its status to public corporation. </p> <p><strong> 'How far we could push'</strong><br> </p> <p>He also worked for Sir William's successor, Sir William Barlow, who had been brought in from heading the ball-bearings group Ransome Hoffman and Pollard. \"This exposed me to the ways of private sector business,\" Mr Roberts said. \"At the time we were preparing to split the Post Office from British Telecom. </p> <p>\"I was influenced by the private sector non-executive directors. We were trying to be as commercial as we could. We were seeing how far we could push the Post Office towards being a fully commercial organisation without actually being one.\" </p> <p>When he took over as managing director of group services in 1993, Mr Roberts had specific responsibility to privatise the Post Office - a plan which collapsed largely as a result of public opposition. </p> <p>\"The 1990s were wasted years for the Post Office because of the privatisation debate. But now we have greater commercial freedom. We have been able to invest about \u00a3500m in companies, mainly in Europe. That has been a fundamental change which none of us would have foreseen.\" </p> <p>The Post Office's immediate future, and its relationship with the government - its shareholder - has been set out formally in the Postal Services Act 2000. The Post Office gets greater commercial freedom and protection from cash-grabbing raids by the Treasury. But the price has been the appointment of a postal regulator.The government has departed from the usual model where the regulatory power is invested in an individual and set up a commission with a chairman, chief executive and five independent members. </p> <p>Postal regulation is unknown ground and the commission is expected to flex its considerable powers, creating extra work for Post Office executives. </p> <p>Yet Mr Roberts hopes he will be able to maintain his routine of starting work at 8am and finishing by 6pm. \"I think it is very important to have a balance between what I do here and what I do outside. It is important for the family. </p> <p>\"I used to be told I was very competitive. I would hope to do a few more years here to see the Post Office through some of the changes we are going through. But there may well come a time when the Post Office needs a different kind of chief executive from a different background.\" </p> <p>One ambition is to \"really understand computers\". He added:\"I use the computer on my desk, especially for email, and I have a computer at home. Like many people in their 50s with a family, you get browbeaten into it.\" </p> <p>He believes the Post Office will have a growing internet-linked business. For example, it wants to be the delivery channel of choice for e-tailers. But, he says, of all the Post Office's businesses, e-commerce is the hardest to predict. \"Five years hence we will still see the mail business generating the bulk of the business, although somewhat reduced from today. The package business will have increased and counters will be holding its own. </p> <p>\"It is important to remember that only 0.6% of retail sales are via e-commerce. I think it will grow rapidly, but 100% of 0.6% is not a lot and we must not get carried away by the hype.\" </p> <p>He is confident he can steer the Post Office through the most radical change in its history. The European commission is threatening to wipe out the bulk of its postal monopoly. The economic viability of its 18,500 outlets is threatened by the government's decision to pay benefits direct to bank accounts from 2003. </p> <p>It is fighting to establish a universal bank for the financially excluded in a move which would replace some of the business lost by the benefits decision. But the big banks have been reluctant to become involved for fear they will end up footing the bill for what is, in effect, a piece of social policy. The British Bankers Association has said it would be shunned because it would have the \"stigma\" of being a poor people's bank. </p> <p>Mr Roberts rejects that argument. \"We have never seen this as a stigma. We have seen it as a service. We have always made people in the Post Office able to deal with every part of society. Our customer base mirrors the UK as a whole.\" </p> <p>The recent Postal Services Act set in law that universal service obligation: to deliver mail to all the country's 27m addresses at a uniform and affordable price. </p> <p>The legislation stipulates that big takeovers, which Mr Roberts feels may soon be necessary, must be cleared by government first. But the Post office has already embarked on new ventures, most notably the acquisition of foreign parcel companies such as German Parcels, and it is offering call centre and internet services to meet new demands. </p> <p><strong> 'Impact on social mail'</strong><br> </p> <p>The changes have not all been welcomed by the workforce. \"We have too much unofficial industrial action and that knocks on into our service.\" </p> <p>Mr Roberts admits to writing fewer personal letters than he used to. \"I think it started 20 years ago when the phone started to be the way for families to communicate. The mobile phone is now having the biggest impact on social mail.\" On the other hand, his business correspondence has gone up by leaps and bounds. </p> <p>A framed set of stamps sit on a book shelf in his office, a present from an American postal organisation. \"Postal executives who travel abroad frequently exchange stamps. I have a bookcase full of stamp albums at home.\" </p> <p>The boy stamp collector has come a long way.</p>",
  "<p>It is said that in wartime London or communist Moscow people would spy a queue, join it and only then seek to discover its purpose. Scarcity and necessity are powerful determining forces. Financial markets encourage similar behaviour, although the perception of scarcity is often illusory, and greed rather than necessity is the magnet that draws the unknowing into the crowd. </p> <p>Information and misinformation are the lifeblood of the stock market. Share prices at any instant in time reflect the sum of all knowledge and belief about a company, its industry, the economy and many other more extraneous factors. The exchange of facts, supposed facts and opinions is continuous, chaotic and almost impossible for the authorities to police. The forums for this exchange may evolve with technological advances - from the coffee shops of yore to the internet chat rooms of today - but their basic functions have not altered for centuries. </p> <p>The flow of information around the market is currently a hot topic for regulatory debate. In America the authorities have clamped down on the traditional practice of selectively briefing investment bank analysts in order to \"smooth\" the impact of news flow on their share prices. In theory those with most to gain are private investors who are disadvantaged by the denial of access to this privileged information flow. </p> <p>Britain's top dog regulator, Howard Davies, chairman of the financial services authority, has responded to the US action with a bold statement that Britain already has a regulatory framework designed to ensure instantaneous, equal access to price-sensitive information from companies. He is relatively new to the job, so it is too early to say whether his bite will prove equal to his bark. His precedent's experience is not encouraging. Full-blown insider trading is another matter, but even here the regulator's hit rate is low. </p> <p>My advice to Mr Davies is threefold. First, oblige companies to issue quarterly financial statements in line with US practice. It is a bore for the companies, not to say more costly. But it would increase transparency and reduce the scope for accounting jiggery-pokery. Second, start to prosecute a few people that flaunt regulations. You can't nail everyone, just nail someone. Third, be realistic. Gossip is part of the market's rich tapestry and life in the market would be poorer without it - metaphorically as well as literally. </p> <p>As a professional broker I am routinely at the front of the queue when new information is doled out.

Cut, paste and forward functions all ensure that gossip spreads wider and faster than ever before. Misinformation flows as fast as facts and can be even more damaging to the integrity of the system. The net also protects anonymity, thereby increasing the ability to manipulate perceptions and prices behind a mask of mystique. </p> <p>Our market makers at Old Mutual Securities have found that gossip on bulletin boards poses a threat to their profitability. In response we have worked with one of our corporate clients, IBNet, to develop a software product, ShareDetec, that roams the internet chat rooms in search of references to companies in which we make markets. In only a couple of months it has proved invaluable. Suddenly the waters are clearer. And, before you ask - yes, IBNet has already announced this project to the market. </p> <p>My few hours on the bulletin boards felt like the human equivalent of IBNet's roaming software with a few keystrokes misprogrammed. I'll never go back to Motley Fool, which was as easy to use as a dictionary with the pages shuffled and unnumbered. By contrast, iii.co.uk proved easy to navigate. I also had to push through the novelty barrier before I could make any use of the tools at my disposal. </p> <p>Once beyond these hurdles I found myself in a world of collegiate dialogue, shared hopes and common bogeymen. Here was a community eager to pool resources in the pursuit of enlightenment and, in turn, enrichment. Leaving aside the low-level buzz of routine conversation, most of what filled the boards was publicly available information, posted for the benefit of all and then dissected over and over again in search of its \"correct\" interpretation. </p> <p>The chat room phenomenon has demystified investment which, let us professionals be honest, is not as technically complex as we would like to have outsiders believe. This is not to say that it is easier to make money than people believe. However, the blizzard of text swirling around bulletin boards runs counter to this demystification process. </p> <p>I was particularly intrigued by a lengthy thread about another of our corporate clients that, in the round, completely misrepresented the current reality within the business. Not because the company was failing to inform the market - the thread's trigger was a news release to the stock exchange - but because an odd confection of inexpert amateurs was rooting through the release in a spirit of paranoia searching for a hidden meaning that did not exist. A fall in the share price of a couple of pence was seized on as confirmation of suspicions and heightened the frenzy. In the end I was glad to log off with my sanity intact. In future I think I will stick to the cappuccino. </p> <p>Edmond Warner is chief executive of Old Mutual Securities </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk\">edmondw@omsecurities.co.uk</a></p>",
  "In the seesaw that is the Northern Ireland peace process, the momentum seems to have shifted back to the republican side. The last 48 hours have brought a double boost to their cause. First came the upbeat report from the two international arms inspectors, Cyril Ramaphosa and Martti Ahtisaari. Following their second look at the IRA's arms dumps they went far beyond a mere declaration that the arsenals had been untouched since their first visit. They added that the dumps were \"substantial\", that the weapons they saw were not rusty, obsolete kit but \"usable\" arms, and that they are convinced that the IRA is serious about peace. Those words represent a PR coup for republicans. <p>Another came yesterday. The agenda may have looked mundane - a meeting launching a food standards agency - but the encounter between Sinn Fein's health minister in the Northern Ireland executive and her Dublin counterpart was a milestone. For last week David Trimble told his Ulster Unionist party he would ban Sinn Fein from all such meetings of the North-South ministerial council, created under the Good Friday agreement, so long as the IRA held on to its guns. Yesterday both Dublin and Mr Trimble's deputy as first minister, the SDLP's Seumas Mallon, sat down with Sinn Fein - effectively showing two fingers to the Ulster Unionist leader. Now Mr Trimble finds himself at odds not only with republicans, but a combination of Dublin, moderate nationalism and even the British government: the secretary of state, Peter Mandelson, has rightly asked for the ban on Sinn Fein to be lifted. </p> <p>Still, such a reading of the peace process - as a constant to and fro between unionists and republicans, with one holding the moral advantage this week, the other the next - may be a mistake. For it misses out a key player. The reason for the IRA's failure to move faster on unionism's central demand may have less to do with Mr Trimble than with the British government. </p> <p>London's dilution of the Patten report on policing has antagonised the IRA - which thought it had agreed a deal with London, trading progress on police reform for decommissioning, back in May. Key aspects of Patten, including both local and international oversight, have been watered down in the process of turning recommendations into law. These changes have not come at the behest of unionists, who have focused on symbolic questions, such as the RUC name and badge, but have been made by the government itself. The Patten inquiry was a fair-minded study. Its findings were just. They deserve implementation on their merits. But their delivery was also promised as the British side of a bargain. It is not just unionists and republicans who must fulfil their obligations. Our own government has a duty to do so too.</p>",
  "Go, Al, go! The Democratic candidate is America's only sensible presidential choice next Tuesday. Despite his troubled campaign, Mr Gore has shown that he is a man who knows his business, has thought carefully about the issues and has the discipline, maturity and character required for the job. <p>His Republican opponent, George W Bush, has proved exactly the opposite. While likeable, even charming in a puppy-dog sort of way, the Texan governor's lack of top-flight experience, his vagueness and unfamiliarity with policy complexities and his evident intellectual laziness have become apparent to all. Neither man has articulated a startlingly different or inspirational vision for America at home. Both have set up their stalls on the crowded political centre ground, Mr Bush with his declared allegiance - somewhat at odds with his record - to \"compassionate conservatism\", Mr Gore with his vow to fight for middle America. Ideology is absent in new millennium America. There are, even so, decisive differences between their claims to the job. For his competence, his commitment and his genuine concern, Mr Gore is the man we hope the voters will pick. </p> <p>On the domestic front, Mr Gore is preferable for numerous reasons. Unlike Mr Bush, he will protect a woman's right to abortion and is clearly determined to uphold the legal rights of minority and disadvantaged citizens. Unlike Mr Bush, the Democrat will try to persuade Congress to enact tougher gun-control laws. When it comes to the key issues of social security provision, prescription medicines and health insurance for young and old alike, Mr Gore's proposals are both more equitable and workable than his opponent's. The Democrat acknowledges that campaign finance reform is essential if America's democracy is not to be further debased; yet despite the strong case for such reform made by John McCain, his main party rival, Mr Bush does not. Mr Gore acknowledges the need for more effective workplace regulation and tougher environmental standards; Mr Bush, the complete corporate candidate, does not. Mr Gore firmly believes that there is a legitimate role for government in a free market society, lest capitalism's excesses overwhelm the less fortunate; Mr Bush does not really. The Democrat refuses to squander the record budget surplus on massive, regressive tax cuts, preferring instead to invest some of that money in education, public services and debt reduction. Mr Bush, at his most irresponsible on this question, espouses reckless, inflationary tax giveaways that could stop the American economic miracle in its tracks and ultimately trigger a worldwide recession. </p> <p>In terms of foreign policy, Mr Bush (to the uncertain extent that he understands the issues at all) is the embodiment of all that is negative and ugly in post-cold war American thinking. He is the child of rightwing congressional and thinktank unilateralists, or neo-isolationists, who undermine the UN, ridicule concepts of nation-building, cut the foreign aid budget, wage trade wars and block or emasculate international treaties. Like them, Mr Bush supports US military disengagement in the Balkans and perhaps elsewhere, persists in regarding China and Russia as potential enemies, believes it right to besiege and bully out-of-favour countries with sanctions and threats, and complains that European allies are not pulling their weight. Yet like the hawks, the Republican simultaneously undermines Nato and global arms control by insisting on a national missile defence system for Fortress America. </p> <p>Mr Bush seems to know little, and care less, about non-military global threats like climate change, desertification, Aids, population growth and developing world poverty, debt and educational under-attainment. His is the exceptionalist mentality of the America Firster who views the outside world as strange and threatening. While this is hardly surprising in a man who has travelled beyond the US on only three occasions in his adult life (excluding visits to Mexico), it is hardly acceptable in a man who aspires to world leadership. His worst know-nothing instincts would probably be tempered by more seasoned advisers. But his is a strikingly narrower outlook than that of Mr Gore who, while hardly faultless on these many issues, would at least try to to maintain the limited, albeit self-serving, internationalism of the Clinton years. </p> <p>The manner in which this year's presidential campaign has been fought leaves much to be desired. Too often it has appeared as a mere beauty contest between two not particularly beautiful men. More than ever before, money, the media and pollsters have set the agenda, particularly through TV ads and chat shows that emphasised the personal and the trivial over the substantive and serious. One consequence is likely to be another disappointing voter turnout, at around 50%. The televised debates would have been more illuminating had the Green party candidate, Ralph Nader, been allowed to participate. Despite this, Mr Nader has waged a valuable and stimulating campaign. The Democrats would do well to give careful consideration to some of his proposed reforms. </p> <p>But after all is said and done, the marginalised Mr Nader cannot win and the lightweight Mr Bush should not be allowed to. When Joseph Lieberman, Mr Gore's running mate, said the Texas governor was not yet ready for the presidency, he was too kind. On this year's showing, Mr Bush is unlikely ever to be worthy of the job. Mr Gore, in contrast, the son of a Tennessee politician, a long-time senator, and vice-president for eight years, is tailor-made for it. It is true he sometimes seems doomed to be the ultimate man in a suit. Exciting he ain't. A visionary he is not. But he is the safe, wise choice - for them and us. So, on Tuesday: Go, Al, go!</p>",
  "What a sad reflection on public life that we can only get rid of Chris Woodhead by his own volition (Woodhead sent packing, November 3). I first encountered him 25 years ago as an innocent A-level student on the infamous creative writing course in Devon. Why did I never see this teacher who was meant to be a co-leader on the course? <p>Despite his lack of example, I become a teacher myself, and for 15 years have taught in the decayed state system of this damaged society. Despite everything, I have felt rewarded by the students, but abused by the reactionary policies Woodhead has been a mouthpiece for. I wish now that I had been more worldly-wise on that course and blown the whistle on Woodhead's shenanigans. Then the world of \"education, education, education\" might have been spared the breathtaking and deceitful opportunism of our now, thankfully, former chief inspector of schools. <br><b>David Lockett </b><br> London </p> <p>\u0095You perpetuate the myth about Woodhead \"raising standards\" (Leader, November 3) and say his reports were full of progress achieved. Yes, progress to more unsuitable curricula in the pursuit of positions on league tables; towards the denigration of music, art, drama, dance and other horizon-widening aspects of education; towards a totally utilitarian view of education in which \"achievement\" is tested ad nauseam by flawed tests; and towards the utter demoralisation of thousands of dedicated men and women working in schools. <br><b> Gunter Helft </b><br> Worcester <br> gunterhelft@lineone.net </p> <p> \u0095School governors have much to be grateful to Chris Woodhead for. Governing bodies, responsible and accountable in law for the conduct of their schools, never had access to information about standards until Ofsted came along. Why? Because the education establishment in schools and local education authorities has never been happy with ordinary people knowing the truth. </p> <p>Ofsted changed that by setting up a system of reports to governing bodies. It has led to a massive cultural change; no wonder so many \"professionals\" are still uncomfortable about it. <br><b> Vivienne Hiett </b><br> Brighton </p> <p> \u0095The truth is Ofsted inspection teams vary enormously in their experience and qualifications. Some make sweeping judgments on little evidence, refuse to correct factual mistakes and even arbitrarily dismiss claims of unfairness in the knowledge that it is politically unwise for schools to make a fuss.

  "The rebel Falkirk West MP Dennis Canavan has been wooed back into the Labour fold by the party leadership, who he once condemned as a cabal of control freaks. <p>In a move which surprised many of his former Labour colleagues and dismayed some in his constituency Mr Canavan announced yesterday that he had been persuaded to re-apply for party membership and believed reconciliation was now \"a distinct possibility\". </p> <p>The move came a month after Mr Canavan announced his intention to resign his Westminster seat, which would have pitched Labour into an awkward byelection at a time when their standing north of the border is at its lowest for a generation. That prompted the party to extend an olive branch and after private talks with party officials, including the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and the new Scottish first minister, Henry McLeish, Mr Canavan was persuaded to realign himself with the party he had joined as a teenager. </p> <p>Mr Canavan, a staunch leftwinger, had been expelled from Labour for standing as an independent in the Scottish parliamentary elections after the late Donald Dewar rejected him as \"not good enough\" to be a candidate for Holyrood. </p> <p>He took the seat with a 12,000 majority and has been a thorn in Labour's side ever since, attacking the leadership at every opportunity and accusing them of intransigence, arrogance and incompetence. </p> <p>His application to rejoin the party will be considered by Labour's NEC at the end of the month, and, if accepted, he will follow party practice and remain as an MP until the general election when he will relinquish the seat and concentrate on his role as an MSP. </p> <p>At a press conference yesterday, Mr Canavan denied that he had sold his soul. \"It is not a question of scuttling back at all,\" he said. \"I was invited to apply and I accepted that invitation. The approach was made by them, not by me. </p> <p>\"I think the Labour party have learned a lesson from the people of Falkirk and I hope that the Labour party leader ship will listen more to people in constituencies as a result of this experience. </p> <p>\"I was virtually born and brought up in the Labour party and despite the disappointing way in which the Labour party treated me I still think that it is capable of not just forming a government but of taking decisions that will benefit some of the most disadvantaged people in society.\" </p> <p>The death of Mr Dewar left the way clear for an approach to Mr Canavan because there had been considerable animosity between the two men. </p> <p>The Scottish National party's deputy leader, Roseanna Cunningham, said the decision was a \"fix\" born of Labour panic about losing the byelection to the SNP.</p>",
  "Stymie had killed Lizard so there was a \"green light\" - the term for a go-ahead for a revenge killing - shining on the Temple Street gang when it met that night. But now a different kind of light is being shone on this meeting four years ago of the young gangsters of Los Angeles, and it has exposed another slice of the biggest police corruption scandal in the city's history. <p>This week four LAPD officers have been standing trial in what could be the first of many such cases. And the outcome will have huge political, social and cultural ramifications. </p> <p>Stymie is Anthony Adams, a member of the Temple Street gang who had killed Lizard, a leading member of the Mexican Mafia - a fearsome prison based gang strong enough to order killings from behind bars. </p> <p>Lizard had been collecting \"taxes\" on his gang's behalf and Stymie had shot him \"as a 'we're not going to pay' kind of thing\". The MM could not let this go unpunished and had demanded thousands of dollars as a \"fine\" before removing the \"green light\". </p> <p>The meeting that was due to take place at the corner of Temple Street and Coronado, a patch known to the police as the Snakepit, was for gang members to discuss how they were going to pay this fine. The police planned to be there, too, and pick up Stymie and his pals. </p> <p>The person explaining all this to fascinated jurors in the city's courtroom 109 is Brian Liddy, one of the accused. He looks like a bull in a sports jacket and is sitting in the witness box on this balmy November day being questioned by his attorney, Paul DePasquale. </p> <p>What happened after Liddy and his colleagues arrived at the Snakepit that night is what the jurors have to decide. </p> <p>Did he and his fellow officer, Michael Buchanan, really get hit by a pick-up truck driven by a getaway gangster or did they make the whole thing up, and frame and beat up the gang member? And are the officers part of a vast scandal that has led to killings, beatings, framings and drug dealing - all carried out by the men who should be enforcing the law? </p> <p>That story starts with Rafael Perez, a policeman caught stealing 2.7kg (6lb) of cocaine from a police locker room in 1998. In a plea bargain deal, he was given a five-year jail sentence in exchange for information about corruption among his fellow officers. </p> <p>What Perez told investigators has now led to more than 100 people having their convictions overturned and left the city facing bills for an estimated $135m (\u00a393m) in law suits from ex-gang members who were framed, beaten and, in one case, paralysed. One victim will not be suing personally: Juan Saldana, 21, was shot and left to bleed to death with a gun planted beside him. </p> <p>Every week over recent months it has seemed that a gang member, usually Latino, has emerged from prison with tales of beatings and plantings. </p> <p>One of the very worst cases was that of Javier Ovando, who was allegedly shot and paralysed by Perez and his fellow officer, Nino Durden. The officers then accused Ovando of attempted murder and he was jailed for 23 years, with the judge chiding him for his lack of remorse. Ovando is out now and will be compensated but will not walk again. </p> <p>The police union, the Police Protection League, has claimed that Perez was a rogue cop and was only implicating his colleagues to save his own skin. But morale among officers has slumped. They say they are now so concerned about being accused of framing or beating gang members that they spend their hours on duty avoiding trouble. This may be the reason for the recent rise in gang shootings, and the renewed activity among the more than 400 gangs and 60,000 gang members in the city. </p> <p>There is a heavy political undertow in LA to accusations that the police have abused their power. In 1992, 54 people died after the riots that followed the acquittal of officers caught on video beating Rodney King. In 1965, in the Watts section of LA, it was police action against an alleged drink driver that led to the riots in which 34 died. This time the city wants to show that it is acting properly, and hence the Los Angeles district attorney, Gil Garcetti, has initiated the prosecutions. </p> <p>Liddy, Buchanan and two other officers, Paul Harper and Edward Ortiz, accused of conspiring to pervert or obstruct justice, are the first fruits of Mr Garcetti's labours. And as their trial comes to its conclusion, there is a political dimension: Mr Garcetti is running for re-election next Tuesday. A conviction would help his credibility and an acquittal would pose questions about his judgment. </p> <p>This week has come a new twist: Perez is not giving evidence as planned because his ex-girlfriend has now claimed that he and a fellow rogue officer, David Mack, had killed a drug dealer and his mother and had buried their bodies in a rubbish tip in Tijuana, Mexico. The Mexican police found no remains. </p> <p>Perez is duly \"pleading the fifth\" - refusing to give evidence in case he incriminates himself in a double murder. But whatever happens in this case, the ramifications are already being felt throughout the city. </p> <p>A few miles from the downtown courthouse, in Boyle Heights in the Latino area of the city, sits Frank, as he suggests we call him. Frank, a good-looking, shaven-headed 20-year-old in a Nike jacket and jeans, has cut his teeth with the Playboys gang. He says that the framing of young gang members is routine and is himself suing the LAPD for planting marijuana and crack on him, which led him to a year in jail. </p> <p><b> Different rules</b><br> </p> <p> \"Rafael Perez was known to us more as a businessman than a policeman. He was one of the big dealers. Have things changed because of what happened? The police just play by different rules now.\" </p> <p>He said that instead of planting drugs on gang members, the police now arrest them for petty offences. \"They do it with righteous excuses now but they're still there.\" </p> <p>Frank is sitting in a room at the back of the centre where Father Greg Boyle - \"G-Dog\" as the young gang members call him - runs a programme that helps them find work and tries to get them out of the gang cycle. </p> <p>Father Greg, who probably knows as many gang members as anyone in California, has noticed a dramatic change in policing since the scandal broke, but it is not a change he welcomes. </p> <p>\"What we have now is police abuse that takes the form of absence,\" he says. \"There is an over-cautious tentativeness, a reluctance to stop the people that they should. They want to get to the ends of their shift not just without being shot but without having a grievance filed or a complaint levelled. Either they're violating human rights in the name of law enforcement or they have a hands-off policy. Both are wrong and both are not helpful. </p> <p>\"I buried my 85th and 86th kids last week,\" says Father Greg. \"One was a 19-year-old gang member and one was a 10-year-old girl caught in the crossfire. A lot of that comes from the tension that kept mounting that could have been largely remedied by a police presence but because we didn't have any, that [the shootings] became an inevitability.\" </p> <p>Back in court, the two young prosecuting attorneys, Laura Laesecke and Anne Ingalls, cross-examine other officers. Without Perez their case is weak. It is further weakened by the reluctance of the police witnesses to remember too clearly what happened on key nights. But Ms Laesecke has got her teeth into the case. She rides the constant cries of \"objection\" from the high-profile all-male defence attorneys as she tries to construct the case against the four. </p> <p>The judge, the elegant Jacqueline Connor, has been attacked by the local press for being pro-police. She watches as Liddy pauses for a split second while he answers as to whether he kicked the fleeing gang member so hard between the legs that he soiled himself. </p> <p>The presidential election has taken over the city's front pages and the taxes being discussed are the ones George W Bush would like to cut, not the kind imposed by the Mexican Mafia. The circumstances that created LA's gangs, the drug laws that take them to court and the jails in which so many languish have not been part of the presidential debate. Neither of the frontrunners offers much in the way of penal reform or a shift in the distribution of wealth. </p> <p>Amazingly to some outsiders, includ ing New York journalists covering the case, there has been little public outrage. To many in LA, it seems, what happens to the young gang members is what they deserve. </p> <p>James Ellroy's book LA Confidential told a story of police corruption in the 1950s, but it was not written until 1990. Perhaps we will have to wait a while for the full story of the current scandal and another 40 years to see Rafael Perez and his gang of untouchables on the big screen in all their terrible glory. </p> <p><b>Crimes and punishments</b></p> <p><b> July 1996</b><br> Police swoop on Temple Street gang and claim to have been injured by fleeing gang members.

  "<p><strong> Three vie for Nats sell-off</strong><br> </p> <p>The government yesterday announced a short list of three consortiums for the controversial part privatisation of National Air Traffic Services, Nats. </p> <p>The list brought an immediate call by unions representing air traffic controllers for the sale to be called off. One, the IPMS, said all three bidders were tainted by conflicts of interest. </p> <p>The short list includes the Airline Group, which brings together British Airways and Virgin Atlantic with six other UK airlines. Also in contention are Nimbus, made up of Serco, Arinc and PPM Ventures, and the Lockheed Martin-backed Novares group. But a bid submitted by US hi-tech group Raytheon has been discarded. </p> <p><strong> Dutch raid on BT offshoot</strong><br> </p> <p>Dutch competition authority the NMa said yesterday it raided offices of broadband company Versatel and mobile phone operator Telfort, owned by British Telecom, in investigating possible rules violations during the country's mobile phone licence auction. </p> <p>The raids followed a transport ministry hearing on Wednesday, where it emerged the two contenders had talked to each other at the start of the auction in July. \"The NMa reasonably suspects competition law has been trespassed,\" the authority said. \"Based on statements from Versatel and Telfort at the hearing of the transport ministry, suspicion has arisen that these two parties ... sought to influence the outcome of the auction.\" </p> <p>A Telfort spokesman downplayed the NMa action, saying it was a \"friendly meeting\". </p> <p><strong> Quaker Oats open to offers</strong><br> </p> <p>European food companies such as Cadbury Schweppes and Nestl\u00e9 could make a move for US food group Quaker Oats after the company rejected a $13bn approach from PepsiCo. </p> <p>The offer for Quaker represented about three times 1999 sales of $4.73bn, in an industry where companies tend to trade between once and twice times sales. </p> <p><strong> Greece to buy Eurofighter</strong><br> </p> <p>The Greek government is expected to sign a deal within the next few weeks to buy up to 90 Eurofighter aircraft, a project involving 40,000 British jobs. </p> <p>That was announced by defence minister Baroness Symons at the start of final assembly of the first production Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft at BAE Systems, at Warton near Preston, Lancashire. </p> <p>According to defence sources, the four-nation Eurofighter consortium fought off an attempt by France to sell its Rafale aircraft to the Greeks. </p> <p><strong> Cold comfort for Unilever</strong><br> </p> <p>Poor summer weather dented Unilever's strategy of concentrating on a limited number of brands with growth potential.

  "<p>In the spring of 1998, I decided I'd like to write a book about the 1925 Scopes \"Monkey\" Trial, the celebrated trial of a schoolteacher accused of teaching evolution in defiance of Tennessee law. This was not an arbitrary choice. My great-great-grandfather was Charles Darwin - something I had given little thought to as an adult until I came to live in America and discovered that his theories were still rabidly contested here. A US Gallup poll taken last year found that 40% of those surveyed favoured teaching creationism instead of evolution in public schools. That same year, the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete virtually every mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum. </p> <p>In early childhood I was told how Darwin's theory of evolution had demolished the biblical story of creation. And if the very first chapter of the Good Book was nonsensical and untrue, why should the rest be any more credible or useful? My parents made an attempt to raise me as a Christian, but ultimately lacked the conviction to boost me over the numerous improbabilities. </p> <p>Most modern scientists - perhaps 99% - believe the world is about 4bn years old. Professor Kurt Wise, associate professor of science and director of origins research at Bryan College in Dayton, Tennessee, puts its age at somewhere around 6,000 years. Kurt teaches his course in two parts: the first from the perspective of theistic evolution - that is, the idea that God used evolution over long periods of time to create the universe. The second half of the course is where he teaches what he really believes: that the \"six days of creation\" were in fact regular \"earth rotation days\" because the same word for \"day\" is used in the Ten Commandments when we are instructed to work six days and rest on the seventh. </p> <p>Kurt is taking a group of Bryan College summer students on a cave geology tour and he invites me along. Several white vans, replete with Christian youth, are parked outside the college. I find one with an empty seat at the back, clamber past a group of clean-cut types of both sexes, and settle in for the ride. \"I hear, like, intellectuals, a lot of them commit suicide?\" squeaks a zit-encrusted teenage boy. \"'Cause they believe what they're taught, evolution an' all, so they got nothing to live for?\" And now he fixes me with a mordant look, like maybe I'm one of them. \"That's true, statistically true,\" says another young man. \"They don't have God in their lives, they don't have Jesus as their personal saviour.\" \"Amen,\" says one of the girls. </p> <p>We've been driving for half an hour before they ask me why I'm here. I keep it simple: a book on the Scopes trial. Most of them are from rural states: South and North Carolina, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Minnesota. Many have been taught at home; most are pleasant but uninteresting, the weird similarity of their views making it hard to distinguish one from another. After about an hour, we arrive at Grassy Cove, a pastoral valley between faint blue mountains, and turn off the main road on to a dirt track. There must be at least 50 of us tramping along in the heat. The entrance to the cave is a ragged horizontal slit, like a mouth clumsily hacked into a Halloween pumpkin. Even more alarming, it's at ground level. Doughty Christians insert themselves into it with difficulty, slither down in steep descent and disappear. Kurt has divided us into small groups, which depart at intervals of five or 10 minutes. </p> <p>Flashlight-less, intensely dubious, I squeeze through the hole. The downward skid is actually quite short. I find myself muddy but uninjured. As Kurt cannot be at every \"point of interest\", he has stationed older students at each, all holding a piece of paper on which is typed what Kurt would have said had he been there: \"The Flood Did It.\" That's the basic message. What the majority of geologists believe took millions of years, Kurt and his fellow creationists believe was done a few thousand years ago in a matter of months, when Noah was forced to sea with all the animals on earth, including his family but excluding the fish. </p> <p>We're asked by the first of Kurt's surrogates, a young woman, to observe a well-preserved fossilised brachiopod in limestone. A brachiopod is a kind of shellfish. We are 1,000ft above current sea level and you can find fossils like this all across America at similar elevations. If brachiopods decay or if they get moved any distance, the muscle that holds the shells together fails, and the shells separate. Modern brachiopods, if they're found whole at all, we're told, are usually found with the shell open and the opening facing upward. This fossilised brachiopod appears to be complete, has its shell closed, and it's on the tilt. To Kurt, this suggests that \"the critter\" was still alive when it was deposited, which suggests it was buried rapidly, which suggests, as Kurt puts it, \"a global diluvial catastrophe\". </p> <p>The student, reading Kurt's words, goes on to talk about the stalagmites near the entrance. Kurt argues that, as these stalagmites, though large, occupy less than 1% of the available space in the cave, they may not be as old as other geologists think; if they were, they would have filled the place up and we wouldn't be here. The cave is so grotesquely dramatic, so tortured, that Kurt's theory - suggesting an upheaval as violent as one's own alarm - does have emotional resonance. Certainly I can imagine a roiling wall of grey mud and rock roaring and cascading into the cave and carving out this infernal canyon. But Kurt seems to want to have his cave and eat it too: this deluge was so fantastically fierce that it burrowed this vast warren out of solid rock in under a year, yet not so fierce as to pulverise the delicate, twin-shelled brachiopod. </p> <p>Inside the next room lurks our new guide, a smiling, sanctimonious young man. When we are all gathered inside, he tells us to sit down and switch off our flashlights. Then, out of the blackness, comes his pious young voice: \"Why don't you lead off, Brittany?\" \"My God is an awesome God!\" sings Brittany in a sweet, high voice, and then the rest join in. \"Be praised!\" Then they all sing together: \"My God is an awesome God! Be praised!\" The room sounds like a small cathedral, more bass, less echo, but it is, I have to admit, pretty awesome, particularly in the darkness. </p> <p>Then we wander off toward the final and most horrific room of all: a vast, meandering, asymmetrical cavern. The ceiling is only 2-3ft from the floor and appears to be supported only by occasional rough columns formed by stalactites and stalagmites fusing together, each column tapering in the middle like some weirdly guttered candle. On top of this massive slab there's a billion tons of mountain and some loony creationist is asking you to crawl into this awful, ill-supported geological death-gap, which, if it collapsed, would leave you flatter than a dime, all so he can expound, through delegates, some nutty theory which every reasonable man on earth knows is utter hogwash. Only a fool would enter. In I crawl. </p> <p>We reach a central column, and slump down to listen to a lecture. I remember none of it. Finally, we're backing out. The mood lightens immediately, suggesting that perhaps I was not alone in my claustrophobic terror. The girls become chatty. I ask what the rules are. Most of them are obvious: no drugs, no cigarettes, no alcohol. A girl fills me in on the dress code. \"No tank tops, no tube tops, no halter tops, no spaghetti straps, no short shorts, and you have to have a one-piece bathing suit.\" As we wind our way up towards daylight, the girls become almost evanescent. One of them asks if I'm a believer. I guess they've rumbled me. </p> <p>\"You should come and sit in on some of our classes,\" she says. \"It would be really helpful.\" The atmosphere on the drive back toward Bryan College is friendlier than it was on the way here. They know who I am, they've absorbed it, and are willing to talk freely about themselves and their beliefs. Their religion, they tell me, is the only true religion, unique because Jesus Christ, the son of God, set foot on earth. No other religion can make that claim. </p> <p>The girls state that they would not marry a non-believer. In fact, they wouldn't even marry a Catholic unless he was born again because it would be hard to live with someone whom you knew was going to hell. Of all their beliefs, I tell them, this born-again-or-go-to-hell thing is the one I find hardest to take. If God is so perfect, why would he care whether you believed in him or not? It seems so petty. Believing in a literal hell, an inferno of unimaginable suffering, they accept with equanimity that seven-eighths of the world, including me, will end up in it. For ever. </p> <p>I am glad to arrive back at the college to be offered hotdogs from a barbecue grill. (The flames! The flames!) I take my food over to a patch of grass and sit down next to a couple of fellow cave-survivors. Exhausted and vaguely depressed, I find Kurt, thank him, and leave. </p> <p>If I went down to Dayton an atheist, I came back an agnostic, refusing to share the arrogance of any conviction in a matter so clearly unprovable either way. In his autobiography, Darwin, who also called himself an agnostic, wrote that the magnificence of the universe almost forces one to conclude that God exists. However, he continued, \"Can the mind of man, which has, as I fully believe, been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the lowest animal, be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions?\" He goes on to say that the problem is compounded by \"the probability that the constant inculcation in a belief in God on the minds of children has produced so strong and perhaps inherited effect on their brains, that it may now be as difficult for them to throw off their belief in God as for a monkey to throw off its instinctive fear of a snake\". For this monkey at least, my great-great-grandfather was right. </p> <p>\u0095 This extract is adapted from Trials of the Monkey: An Accidental Memoir, by Matthew Chapman, which is published by Duck Editions on November 16 2000, price \u00a314.99.</p>",
  "<p>Aribert Reimann is best known as the composer who made an opera from Shakespeare's King Lear. In daring to tackle a subject that had defeated both Verdi and Britten, he produced a work that was widely performed across Europe following its premiere in 1978. There have been three more stage works since, all demonstrating Reimann's belief that great literature can produce viable librettos. The Ghost Sonata, based on Strindberg's play, appeared in 1984 (Opera Factory staged it in London five years later), Troades (after Euripedes' The Trojan Women) in 1986, and The Castle (from Kafka's unfinished novel) in 1992. </p> <p>Now he has turned his attention to Lorca, compiling the libretto for his latest opera from a German translation of The House of Bernarda Alba, the Spanish poet's last play. Bernarda Albas Haus, as it becomes, was commissioned jointly by the Komische Oper in Berlin and the Bavarian State Opera, which gave the first performance in Munich on Monday. </p> <p>While musically and dramatically first class, the work shows, however, that there are some subjects a composer - even one with Reimann's chutzpah - should leave alone. Lorca's drama, about a matriarch whose repressive control over her household and five daughters has tragic consequences, is so powerful and bleak that it is hard to see what any music could add to its intensity, let alone a score like Reimann's, whose musical language, stemming from Berg and Webern, is better at defining extremes of emotion than more subtle nuances. </p> <p>What theatrical power there is in Bernarda Albas Haus derives entirely from the raw bones of Lorca's dramaturgy; at least half of the text is spoken, either unaccompanied or given a febrile orchestral backdrop, while the rest is pushed into jagged vocal lines of great swoops and leaps. For Reimann, at least, expressionism is alive and well. It all makes for tough going through the two-hour, three-act span of the work, and the most operatically effective passages are those where Reimann does least to compromise the directness of the drama. Two scenes carry real punch: the confrontation between Bernarda and her housekeeper, La Poncia, which is played out over a bare cello line; and the monologue of the deranged grandmother Maria Josefa (a spoken role anyway), underpinned by a mesh of string chords. But it is Lorca delivering the punch, not the composer. </p> <p>Each of the characters in the all-female cast is given her own sound world. Bernarda is defined by the 12 cellos in the orchestra, and even though much of the orchestral writing is redundant, its gestures can be bold and imaginative. There are four pianos in the pit, two with sheets of paper laid across the strings to produce dull percussive sounds. With a contrabass clarinet, they add a baleful presence to the widely spaced textures in which Reimann exploits the extremities of the instruments' ranges. </p> <p>Thematically and structurally the score is rigorous, but it does nothing to enhance what is already there in the words and action. At its best the effect is like film music; at its worst it seems distracting. It never threatens to become essential. </p> <p>In terms of production and performance, though, the Bavarian State Opera has undoubtedly done their commission proud. The conductor Zubin Mehta ensures that all the effects in the score come across with maximum intensity, while Harry Kupfer stages it in a ravishing set by Frank Philipp Schlossmann: a white box festooned with chairs on every surface, which takes on innumerable hues under Max Keller's lighting. </p> <p>Kupfer obtains performances of visceral power and physicality. Vocally it is equally remarkable. Just as Reimann tailored the title role in Lear for Dietrich Fischer- Dieskau, so the part of Bernarda Alba was designed for another great singer, Helga Dernesch. This great Wagnerian may be at the end of her career but she makes the most of everything she has left and physically dominates the stage too, epitomising the cruel presence around whom the household is spinning into chaos. </p> <p>There are superb performances from Isolde Elchlepp as La Poncia and Anne Pellekoorne, Jennifer Trost, Margarita De Arellano, Claudia Barainsky and Anna Korondi as the daughters. They deliver Reimann's demanding writing with immense care, getting every word across, though it is sad to discover even Munich has succumbed to the tyranny of surtitles - despite the libretto being in German. It only serves to underline that in this case the words matter a lot more than the music. </p> <p>\u0095 In repertory at the Bayerische Staatsoper until November 13. Box office: 00 49 89 2185 1920.

  "Most gardeners only feel the need for cold frames in the spring, when hardening off seedlings and cuttings or starting cucumbers, but a good reason for writing about them now is that one might make a good Christmas present for a loved one. <p>In fact we at Great Dixter have made great year-round use of cold frames for the past half-century. Certainly they are in great demand in spring for both raising and hardening off seedlings. Also, they will be useful for establishing newly potted, rooted cuttings taken off soft perennials in the autumn - verbenas, fuchsias, felicias, diascias, \"geraniums\", gazanias and many more. These will have been over-wintered under just frost-free glass, but from March onwards should be treated individually in a potting compost. The cold frame gets them started until they can be stood outside. </p> <p> In May, we shall still be sowing tender annuals like ipomoeas, zinnias and cucumbers (for growing on the compost heap). But we also make late sowings of quite ordinary annuals like cosmos and marigolds, annual rudbeckias and dahlia seed strains, so as to have a follow on in the borders to plants that fizzle out after the end of June. This keeps things looking fresh right into October. We also make late dahlia cuttings for the same purpose.</p> <p> Before this, cold frames are useful for starting dahlia and canna tubers into new growth when they come out of winter storage. They are bedded into moist peat and the frame is at first kept closed but able to be shaded if the sun is hot. We sow our pansies and violas in July, but they need to be kept cool in order to get a good, even germination, so no frame for them. A pane of glass over the pot or seed tray and a position under a tree will suit them, but the frames are still useful at this time of year as a standing area for young plants that were raised from cuttings - hydrangeas, for instance. The frames' sides are a protection against wind. </p> <p> In autumn, nearly all my display pots containing tulip, narcissus, hyacinth and other bulbs are placed in a cold frame, where the amount of rain they receive can be controlled and they will often remain there until just bursting into flower, the protection having advanced their flowering dates by a week or two ahead of those that were planted in the garden, so you get a nice succession. </p> <p>The frames offer protection to many potted plants in winter - most of it young stock later destined for the garden. It is not just a question of a higher temperature; it may be little warmer inside than outside, but the frame also keeps out desiccating winds. In my opinion, it is essential that a frame should have solid walls. These give you far greater protection and control over temperature fluctuations. An all-glass or polycarbonate version heats up famously - probably too much - during the day, but temperatures plummet as soon as the sun is gone. Residual warmth is all-important. This is ensured partly by solid wooden or concrete walls and partly by mats (any old matting or piece of carpet, hessian or blanket, supposing it hasn't already been destroyed by your dogs) put over the frame in the evening and removed the next morning. </p> <p> Probably the most satisfactory example will be the one you have made yourself. Use treated (what is known as \"tanalised\") pine, which will last for 10 years. You want a double layer of boards for height, each 14-15cm across. Then a third layer of board sawn at an angle so that they are three boards high at the back and two at the front. This will give you the sloping lid that throws off rain and the whole frame should be roughly facing the sun. The boards are screwed at the frame's corners into uprights of what you order as lengths of, say, 5cm x 5cm tanalised pine (the sides may also need strengthening with uprights). Polycarbonate sheeting is ideal for the lids, being lighter than glass and less easily broken. This is nailed or screwed to a wooden frame. </p> <p> It is usually a good idea to build a central partition into the frame, with a light over each section. This will allow you to treat the two halves separately, the one kept closed, most probably, till seeds have germinated or cuttings rooted, the other ventilated for hardening off. Be very careful to avoid sun-scorch by day. Clear glass will give some protection. So will ventilation. Damp the foliage down in the morning with a fine spray from a can. The ideal to aim for is moisture by day but dry foliage by night. Under close conditions when you don't want to admit air, a weekly spray with a fungicide (varying the active ingredient so as not to allow resistant strains of fungi to develop) is important. The grey mould botrytis fungus can do so much damage so quickly.</p>",
  "<p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) was set up by the government after the BSE debacle to \"protect our right to expect food that is safe and of a high quality\". And after the publication of the Phillips Inquiry into BSE, the promises made by government for the FSA seem even more pertinent. It was to be independent, open and \"run by people with expertise in food safety and without any hidden agenda\". It has now been in operation for eight months, and already disillusionment is rife. Eyebrows were first raised when its government-appointed boss, Sir John Krebs, appeared on Newsnight shortly after coming into the job. Sir John is a distinguished zoologist and authority on badger culling, with no particular \"expertise\" in food. Nevertheless, after being grilled by Jeremy Paxman, it was apparent that he had quite firm opinions that were supportive of genetically modified food, and was critically unconvinced of the benefits of organics. </p> <p> In February, he again demonstrated his interest in biotechnology by chairing an Organisation For Economic Co-operation And Development (OECD) conference on GM food in Edinburgh. Then, last month, Sir John made a surprise attack on organics: \"[People are] not getting value for money . . . if they think they're buying extra nutritional quality or extra safety [when they buy organic food], because we don't have the evidence to support these claims.\" The Soil Association, which campaigns for organic farming, was somewhat miffed. Its policy director, Patrick Holden, says, \"Sir John has been badly advised. There are some 150 studies that demonstrate significant qualitative nutritional differences between organic and conventional food, and we have asked the FSA to fund more research into this area. Sir John is displaying bias by rubbishing the only system that is actually addressing consumer concerns.\" </p> <p>On the enhanced safety of organic food, the Soil Association is happy to give chapter and verse - for example, that 43% of conventional fruit and vegetables contain pesticide residues, whereas the organic equivalents do not. But one fact is particularly persuasive: no fully organic cattle have contracted BSE, while 177,263 conventional ones have. At the Food Commission, an independent food watchdog that welcomed the setting up of the FSA, concern is now mounting over the FSA's handling of BSE. \"We were looking for an agency that would be more open than MAFF [Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food] and make fewer blunders,\" says the commission's Dr Tim Lobstein. \"What we've got is an agency that is a bit more open, but is still making blunders. About half the representation at its BSE 'stakeholder' meetings has come from the meat industry. As a result, the agency was actually considering lifting the ban that prevents cattle over 30 months going into the food chain. Following research showing how the disease could be transmitted through blood transfusion and the increase in human deaths from vCJD [variant CJD], it had to drop the idea.\" </p> <p> On its ability to combat food poisoning, the FSA is also found wanting. \"The FSA is a complete charade,\" says Dr Richard North, food poisoning authority and research director for Europe of Democracies and Diversities. \"The FSA has been sidelined by the European Commission, which has quietly taken over control of food safety policy and enforcement. Sir John is effectively the head of a branch office of the new European Food Authority, and is left playing around with trivia in areas not covered by the commission's initiatives.\" For an illustration of this point, look no further than the FSA's recent revelations that 30% of frozen chickens contain more water than is legal. It is an old food scam that has been exposed repeatedly over the years by independent organisations such as the Consumers' Association and Food Commission, and numerous trading standards departments. It is politically safe territory, though - unlike the contamination of farmers' conventional seed with GM seed, urgent information that the FSA sat on for five whole weeks. So, the question now needs to be asked, is the old Machiavellian MAFF culture that brought us BSE in the first place now reasserting itself in the FSA?</p> <p> \"So many of the civil servants are ex-MAFF or Department of Health, and the board is loaded with people without a relevant background in food policy,\" says Tim Lang, professor of food policy at Thames Valley University. North agrees: \"Sir John is coming like a baby to an intensely political subject and being made to stick to the old MAFF orthodoxy by civil service minders.\" And Dr Lobstein goes even further: \"Sir John's lack of experience in food leaves him open to manipulation by civil servants and the food industry.\" The FSA, meanwhile, denies that any of this is the case: \"Sir John is coming from a position of independent, objective scientific assessment with no predisposition to one view or another,\" a spokesperson says. But if the FSA is to be anything more than a useless and expensive clone of MAFF, it needs to represent informed consumer opinion. Post-BSE, consumers have shown very clearly what kind of food they trust: it's no coincidence, after all, that our supermarkets are now brimming with organic food, while GM food is being forced off the shelves. Yet the FSA seems to be pursuing a curiously contrary agenda with its annual budget of \u00a3140 million, most of which is financed from the public purse. What's the point of a consumer watchdog that's totally out of step with what consumers want? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk\"> www.greenpeace.org.uk</a> has a guide on GM supermarket foods.</p>",
  "<p>Why don't more people live in radical, experimental, cutting-edge, call-them-what-you-will ultra-modern houses? Answer: Ask a five-year- old child to draw a house. Whether from a rich or poor background, whether born in a council flat in Glasgow or a mock Tudor mansion in Weybridge, the result will almost always be the same. A funny little box-like house with a pitched roof, smoking chimney, centrally placed door, a window on either side downstairs and two windows more or less symmetrically arranged above them. Quite often there will be a big sun shining above the roof and in the green crayon strip of garden below a stick mummy, a stick daddy and perhaps a cartoon-like cat. </p> <p> I was gently challenged on this very subject a few months ago by fellow journalist John McCarthy, when he was making a BBC radio series on the nature of house and home. Even if they lived in a flat, he asked? Even if they were from single-parent families? Yes. McCarthy checked up on the theory by visiting an inner-city school and asking a class of children to draw a house. The theory did indeed hold up. McCarthy was astonished - but only until he had thought the notion through with me and other people for whom the history of house and home (not the same thing) are compelling subjects. </p> <p> What the children are drawing, more or less, is a portrait of the human face. The first thing a child sees, or tries to focus on when born, is its mother's face. Well, breast maybe, but the mother spends a lot of time looking into her baby's face. When a young child draws a house, it puts a door where the mouth or nose is on its parent's face and windows for eyes. In the child's mind's eye, the house is home, a kind of anthropomorphic building-being, a sanctuary that is (or should be) as cosy and as reassuring as its mother's arms. </p> <p> Home, then, is a notion as old as the human species. It is hardly surprising that the vast majority of people - whether they live in caves, as many still do in Guadix and Cappadocia; in mud, stone or straw huts; or in flats or houses - experience the home as a kind of replacement for the womb. Most like it to be a fixed point in their lives both emotionally and physically: old- fashioned, comforting, familiar. In Britain, although we like the idea of a groovy, modern studio-type apartment in a city centre, many people still share a dream of coming back, somehow, to the equivalent of a cosy cottage with perhaps a walled garden - a thing of inglenooks and log fires, of dogs damp after a long walk, of roast Sunday lunches and nips of sloe-gin in winter. Human beings tucked up as snug as bugs in rugs in the brick-and-stone arms of a friendly building-being. </p> <p> Nicolas Pople, an architect and senior lecturer at London's South Bank University, has published a book called Experimental Houses, about buildings that are as far removed as can be imagined from the ones that children draw. Why? Because, as Pople says in his introduction, \"experimentation is an inherently conscious act and is never innocent. The gesture of the experimental is expansive, moving beyond the known and immediately comprehensible, but with a clear set of objectives in view\". </p> <p> One of the new experimental homes in the book, an elegant concrete, aluminium and glass affair near Bordeaux, is designed by the influential architect Rem Koolhaas. As self-conscious as a Hollywood starlet, this is the house as box of tectonic tricks - a whole room acts as an elevator, linking all three floors - a clever game for fashionable architects to play as they get to grips with the ambitions and vanity of the wealthy, artistic bourgeoisie - and fail to respond to those for whom such a house is a magazine dream. </p> <p> In terms of making nice images in hard-to-read architecture and la-la design magazines, Koolhaas's decidedly cool house has been a winner on the grandest scale. Unlike the traditional home represented guilelessly in children's drawings, this place is as much public relations exercise as experiment, a clever concatentation of forms designed to excite those brought up in a world of architecture refracted in the lenses of cameras or shone through slide projectors in design schools. </p> <p> It is a house that seems to follow you around the globe: here it is, in model form, in an exhibition on modern homes in New York; here again in another handsome book touching down among a library of others on my desk, at least four of which show pictures of this very same building. If home is where we return for shelter and solace, to hide away from the uncertainties of the everyday world, to close the door and soak in the bath a million miles from the public stage where our hair is brushed and faces painted, then Koolhaas's creation is the opposite of home. It is a glamorous film set playing all the latest architectural games. It would be great fun for a holiday or a surprise weekend away, but, like so many experimental houses, not a place most people would consider living in. </p> <p> I hate to sound conservative or as if I am putting the dampers on architectural experimentation, for the story of architecture at its best has been one of adventure and game-playing. Often this has been no more than the equivalent of rearranging deckchairs on an ocean liner, but there have been revolutions, both aesthetic and technological. These have pushed both the design of homes and the ways we experience them into futures that on the one hand have given us the flushing lavatory, and on the other the Rem Koolhaas dwelling near Bordeaux. </p> <p> Intriguingly, most of the major revolutions came very early on. Recently I stayed in a beautiful courtyard house, rebuilt countless times since it was first raised by Spanish Moors in the 14th century. Its design - solid walls keeping the world beyond at bay, colonnaded courtyards, an ancient underfloor central heating system and a wind tower for distributing cool air during the hottest Mediterranean months - dates back way beyond the arrival of the Arabs in Spain in the eighth century, back beyond the Romans who gave us their \"hypocausts\" (underfloor central heating), to the beginnings of civilised housing. This house - television, fridge and other mod cons aside - would be familiar to the residents of Ur, capital of Sumerian civilisation, between five and six thousand years ago. This is a sophisticated house - more complex than a child's drawing - yet it embodies nearly everything that we could possibly want in a city home. </p> <p>Short of technology, then, have all the experiments in rural and urban housing since Ur and Sumerian civilisation been no more than architectural conceits and the vanity of riches? </p> <p> To an extent, yes. Most of the types of homes we live in were invented a long time ago. Even the high-rise apartment block that we tend to think of a post-second world war horror (for the poor if not for the rich who have taken to it in Manhattan, as in Manila, as eagles to their mountain eyries), was a Roman invention. At its crowded, intensely noisy height in about 200AD, the centre of imperial Rome was ringed around with five- and even eight-storey apartment blocks (insulae).</p> <p> These tended to be shoddily built and many deaths were caused by the Roman equivalent of chip-pan fires, but you would find yourself more at home here than you might imagine. The smartest Roman homes, for instance, as in homes from earlier Mediterranean and Mesopotamian civilisations, boasted various forms of lavatory that would be acceptable to most of us today.</p> <p> Air-conditioning? It gets hot in Rome, doesn't it? Yes, but responsibly and sensually designed homes throughout the world have never needed refrigerating; instead, the best have made use of wind as well as deep eaves, fountains, colonnades, shutters and other simple architectural devices to keep extreme heat at bay. In any case, Arab domestic architecture featured effective air-conditioning centuries ago. In the heart of medieval Cairo, you can visit old merchant houses cooled by air that is caught by funnels rising like those of ships above the dense roofscape. </p> <p> Double-glazing, then? Again, that goes back a very long way, too. Open-plan living? Didn't that come in just about a century ago with Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago? Well, yes, but it was also a feature of cave dwellings, of the grass skerms of Kung Bushmen, of the Inuit igloo, of the great communal dwellings of the Yanomamo Indians of the Orinoco river basin, of Arab tents, Kazakh yurts . . . of the beautiful cluster dwellings of the Awuna people of Ghana or the sophisticated multi-cylinder homes of the Mesakin Quisar people of Sudan. </p> <p> Alright, clever clogs, what about the mass-produced modular house invented by Le Corbusier (1887-1965) and made possible by 20th-century war-time and Fordian conveyor belt technology? I'm sorry. Try going back to Kahun, the 20-acre, 27th-century (BC) new town built to house the workers engaged on building the Illahun pyramid for Sesostris II. Here, rows of mass-produced worker's homes sharing near identical plans have been identified. In some ways, these fast-track dwellings were more sophisticated than their 20th-century counterparts, because internal walls were clearly arranged, or perhaps even moved, as and when a particular family needed more or fewer rooms. This 5,000-year-old idea was to be one of the revolutionary selling points of the Millennium Village currently being built on the North Greenwich peninsula, London, in the long shadow of the Dome. The ancient Egyptian workers' dwellings also featured roof terraces and were built of 100% recyclable materials. </p> <p> Even so, few architects have proved to be as adventurous as the imaginations of, say, Marco Polo (Travels) or Italo Calvino (Invisible Cities), both of whom have created gloriously experimental houses in their respective mind's eye. Nicolas Pople quotes Polo's compelling description of Kublai Khan's pavilion: \"let me tell you how these two halls and the chamber are constructed. Each hall has columns of spicewood very skilfully carved. On the outside they are all covered with lion-skins of great beauty, striped with black and white and orange. They are so well designed that neither wind nor rain can harm them or do any mischief. Inside, they are all of ermine and sable which are the two finest and costliest furs there are... and the chamber where the Khan sleeps... is also of lion-skins without and ermine and sable within, magnificent in workmanship and design.\" </p> <p> Today, few of us wish to kill such rare and magnificent animals for their skins, yet Polo captures for us a dreamy and sensual home - an experiment in imaginative living - that few radical modern architects with their clumping concrete, insistent brick and deterministic steel can hope to match in the wonder stakes. Although modern architecture has become fashionable over the past 20 years, few architects have been able to shake the vast majority of people from their simple and possibly innate dream of a house that looks like a child's drawing and which, for better or worse, was invented with humankind </p> <p>\u0095 Experimental Houses, by Nicolas Pople, is published by Lawrence King at \u00a345.

  "<p>Having big ears is one of the oddest peculiarities to have because no one quite knows what it means. For example, if you're a man with big ears, women don't titter in the street, wink knowingly and say, 'Look at the size of his ears!' Or they might do, but that's the end of the conversation. Women don't really have a big-ear problem, as they can grow their hair over them. All you have to remember is to go for big hair all over. Simply growing hair over the affected area will make you look as though you're wearing earmuffs. </p> <p>Some lobally-challenged people refer laughingly to their big ears as love handles.

The trick here is to make sure the glue is strong enough. There's nothing worse than making a big social entrance with your nicely flush ears, only to have one suddenly break free and fly open like a taxi door. </p> <p>Big-ear wearers, like Battle of Britain pilots, are constantly aware of the position of the sun. When the sun gets behind your ears it gaily shines straight through them, making you look as though you've got a couple of Chinese lanterns attached to your head. If a group of people are laughing unexpectedly at you and you know you've got a big pair of rubbery flappers, check the sun. </p> <p>When night falls, the trials of the big-eared are far from over. Turning over on your pillow requires as much attention to the positioning of the ears as a pilot would give to the positioning of the undercarriage on landing. If you accidentally fold an ear over and spend the night with the weight of your head on it, not only will it stick out in the morning, but there's a very good chance that it will be pointing forward. And that's a distinction you don't need on a crowded bus. Especially if it's on its way to the Cup Final.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Poisoning the Minds of the Lower Orders</strong><br> Don Herzog<br> Princeton, \u00a312.50<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000092243,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> Rather a find, this one. While it appears under an academic imprint, it seems as though the author is not exactly following the brief that his discipline would suggest. Herzog teaches law and political philosophy at the University of Michigan; but he appears to have written a book about British politics, prejudices and manners between 1790 and 1830. Moreover, he has done so with a scholarly thoroughness that one would not have suspected from someone writing, so to speak, left-handedly. </p> <p>But an air of carnival infects his book. His subject may seem dry, but he handles it with almost mischievous \u00e9lan. And this subject? Largely, the beginnings of modern conservatism; and particularly as it manifests itself in reaction to the French Revolution. We have a parade of all the gargoyles of the day getting themselves into a lather about the number and influence of new-fangled newspapers; the inadvisability of people from the working classes discussing politics in coffeehouses and (worse) alehouses; the question of whether Jews, blacks and women were to be admitted into the thinking classes, or indeed even the human classes. </p> <p>Herzog reminds us of some uncomfortable facts. Cobbett, the radical, was offensively anti-negro, even by the standards of the day; whereas Johnson, the Tory, could see no justification for discrimination on the basis of skin colour. Byron was disgustingly anti-semitic, as was, indeed, the whole culture: \"Eager vocalists turning to The Universal Songster could learn the words to some fifty songs featuring Jews, among them the ever memorable ... 'The Jew Pedlar Selling a Pig, 'Jabesh Ham; or, the Catastrophe of a Pork-Chop Dinner', and 'De Chinkling of de Cash'. Somehow these aren't the sort of deep sea treasures that surface when social historians want to wax romantic about popular culture.\" This is not cut-and-dried partisan history. Look at the swipe he gives EP Thompson, for instance. </p> <p>Herzog's tone is sceptical, constructively flippant, mordant - and, above all, readable. He is even more fun to read than our own Roy Porter, a social historian who has crossed over into a relatively widespread readership. Herzog deserves the same, and if he is a bit too fond of the word \"squelched\", as in what usually happens to human rights, we can forgive him that in the wider scheme of things. </p> <p>What makes this book truly special is the way that you can start thinking \"that reminds me of something ...\" without Herzog's having had to spell it out at all, or even hint at it. The patrician concern about the proliferation of newspapers is echoed in today's reactions to the internet; the justifications for state secrecy and misinformation are as alive now, with the persecution of David Shayler and others, as they were then; and stirring up the mob for illiberal, if not sinister, purposes, is something that we should research with the impending fuel blockade in mind. </p> <p>That Herzog allows these connections to form without the slightest nudge on his part is something almost magical. I know that many people out there would rather eat one of their own feet than read a supposedly academic work like this; but do give it a go. You'll find it's worth it.</p>",
  "<p>Professor Evelyn Fox Keller lounges in a swivel chair in her office at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , with her sockless feet in battered Reeboks on the desk in front of her; from time to time, when agitated, she spins round and rests them on the desk behind her, as sturdy and cluttered as the other one. It's a nice metaphor for the way she fits into the angular world of professional science. She is on top of several subjects, as a pioneering feminist critic and philosopher of science, who has also been a working biologist, but ostentatiously comfortable only on her own terms. </p> <p>Tom Wilkie, adviser in bio-medical ethics at the Wellcome Trust, says that her kind of criticism of science is something that this country badly needs: \"As the BSE crisis shows, we tend to treat scientists as disembodied experts in this culture, but her stuff fills out a fuller picture of the relationship between science and the world around it.\" </p> <p>Her honours as a scientist are numerous: she has been a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study, where Einstein worked, and has won a MacArthur \"genius\" award. But she is also famous for an attack on Harvard (where she gained a doctorate in theoretical physics in 1963) and as a feminist scholar of science. To find her in the splendour of MIT - Nerd Central itself and just up the road from Harvard - is something of a surprise. </p> <p>It is as a feminist critic of science that she is best known. According to the American writer Pamela Weintraub, Keller's work has \"cast a pall on science and its glorious priesthood, whose powerful political bias affects the 'description of nature' emerging from the lab\". </p> <p>Keller was born in 1936, one of three children in a poor Jewish New York City family, first-generation immigrants from Russia. Her father worked in a delicatessen. The children \"made spectacularly good,\" she says: her sister Frances Fox Piven is a political scientist and poverty campaigner; her elder brother Maurice is a biologist at MIT. Evelyn attributes some of their success to the New York public school system - \"It was wonderful. It really was.\" </p> <p>Her original ambition was to be a psychoanalyst: \"I heard about the unconscious when I was 12 from my older sister, and I thought it was the neatest thing I had ever heard.\" It's a big swerve from there to theoretical physics, especially as psychoanalysis is now discredited as about the most unscientific theory that could ever have existed. But she retains a huge admiration for Freud. </p> <p>Maurice was a physicist by then, but it was Evelyn's comparative failure in English composition that tipped the balance. \"No matter how I tried, I couldn't get better than a C in English. I was reading the George Gamow books [popular science of the 50s in which the ordinary hero, bored by physics lectures, falls asleep and understands what is said in the course of vivid dreams] and my older brother was a scientist. So I started to write my English essays about physics topics. All of a sudden I got As.\" </p> <p>She moved into physics, intending to return to psychoanalysis after she had got a degree, but at Brandeis University, something extraordinary happened. Instead of cleverness being a means in itself, or at least a means of escape from the circumstances of her upbringing, it suddenly became something unselfish. She fell in love with theoretical physics. </p> <p>This is not a metaphor, says Keller, but a literal description of her experience. She once expanded on it in an article: \"I fell in love simultaneously and inextricably, with my professors, with a discipline of pure, precise, definitive thought, and with what I conceived of as its ambitions. I fell in love with the life of the mind. I also fell in love, I might add, with the image of myself striving and succeeding in an area where women had rarely ventured. It was a heady experience.\" This idealism is part of a fierce romantic quality that friends detect in her. Gillian Beer, president of Clare Hall, Cambridge, says, \"She's full of a sort of dark life: there's tremendous intensity in her relationships, and even in her laughter. She's a very loyal friend, though she also has enemies, whom she rather relishes.\" </p> <p>As a young scientist, Keller believed she was part of the greatest adventure that humans had ever embarked on: \"I thought it was a cooperative venture in which people wanted to find out what the world was made up of\"; and that the people she worked with were, by definition, working for the benefit of humanity - though perhaps, in those days, she would have said \"mankind\". Years later she wrote: \"I believed not only in the possibility of clear and certain knowledge of the world, but also in the unique and privileged access to this knowledge provided by science in general and physics in particular. I fully accepted science, and scientists, as arbiters of the truth - physicists were, of course, the highest arbiters.\" </p> <p>She graduated in 1957, a year when the prestige of American scientists was as high as it would ever be. She wrote her undergraduate thesis on the work of Richard Feynman [the Nobel Prize winner regarded as the purest example of idiosyncratic genius among all the discoverers of quantum mechanics] and wanted to go to California to study with him. But in the end she went on a state scholarship to Harvard, and almost at once her dreams collapsed. </p> <p>She had no trouble with the work, but she found the atmosphere unendurable. \"Harvard was a disaster,\" she says now. \"It was a very difficult time to be a woman in a physics department.\" There were only three women among the 100 postgraduate physicists. Several months into her first year, a teacher offered her a lift and asked how she was getting on. As she started to tell him, she almost burst into tears; then realised that admitting her feelings filled him with acute discomfort, as if, instead, she had started to take off her clothes. The experience made her even more buttoned up, even more miserable. It is hard to believe now that this confident woman in steel-rimmed spectacles with a huge gleeful smile could ever have been embarrassed about anything. But she was, and she was deeply miserable. She felt persecuted by the faculty and by her fellow students, and bitterly disappointed by the work she was doing. </p> <p>\"I went to graduate school to learn about... the nature of space, time, and matter... I was taught, instead, how to do physics. In place of wisdom, I was offered skills. Furthermore, this substitution was made with moralistic fervour. It was wrong, foolhardy, indeed foolish, to squander precious time asking 'why?'. Proper humility was to bend to the grindstone and learn techniques.\" </p> <p>She found this narrowing of the boundless horizons of science quite mystifying, and was still more puzzled that the people who did it were proud of their narrowed horizons. \"I didn't fully understand that in addition to the techniques of physics, they were also learning the techniques of arrogance.\" She toyed with the idea of going to medical school, but a certain stubbornness kept her going even after she had passed her first set of exams early and felt she had little more to prove. </p> <p>It was chance and family connections that showed her the way out in the summer of 1960. Her brother Maurice, newly married, was spending the summer at Cold Spring Harbor, a small village on the north shore of Long Island which is one of the capital cities of modern biology; it houses a permanent government funded research laboratory and hosts a series of influential science conferences. \"I went there for the summer, because he had a spare room - well, half a spare room, because he had a baby.\" </p> <p>These were the years in which it seemed that all life could be understood by probing at its simplest structures: bacteria and the viruses that prey on them; and most of this work was done by men who had trained as physicists. The structure of DNA had been unravelled by Crick and Watson in 1953, but its code - the syllables spelt out by the letters Crick and Watson had discovered - was not cracked until 1963; and, of course, the task of turning those syllables into intelligible words, and then deciphering the grammar and syntax of their language still continues. Max Delbruck, one of the leaders of this revolution, was working at Cold Spring Harbor, and got her to work in a lab there: \"they were all on the lookout for smart young things, especially from physics\", she says with an unselfconscious acceptance of her own smartness. </p> <p>She switched her attention entirely to biology, and persuaded the physics department to let her take a doctorate in theoretical physics with a dissertation that was in molecular biology: she had thought of a technique which would make it possible to decide whether one or both strands of DNA were used to make proteins: she thought the task would take weeks. It took more than a year in practice, and she left with a doctorate and a conviction that she was not really cut out to be an experimental scientist. \"I couldn't stand it when I'd see three weeks of work go down the tube because someone brushed against the water heater and the temperature went up. There were just so many variables out of control.\" </p> <p>Matt Meselson, the professor under whom she took her PhD, remembers her as a young woman in a hurry. \"She just wanted to get her doctorate quickly and get out. Most of the other students were less impatient. She worked hard. But she didn't really have the patience.\" </p> <p>So she moved to New York, working again as a theoretical physicist at New York University, and in 1964 married her boss, Joseph B Keller, a mathematician of great distinction. Shortly there after, they had two children - a son and a daughter. Jeffrey, now 35, is a software engineer; Sarah, 34, is a university teacher. </p> <p>Evelyn started work in yet another field, this time mathematical biology. She was happy. Two of the papers she wrote are said to be classics in the field: working with the mathematician Lee Segel, she produced equations to describe an extremely puzzling phenomenon: how it is that some single-celled amoebas can change, when times are hard, into a single, multi-cellular organism, without any one cell being responsible for the transformation. \"This was all very nice, but in 1969 I followed my husband to California. [where he still is] Lee was going round the country talking about our work, and he was getting more and more excited, and I was sitting at home getting more and more bored. So I started thinking about women and science.\" In fact she started to study her own predicament as a mathematical biologist with the tools of mathematical biology. She got hold of all the data she could find about women scientists: how many there were, and how long they lasted in their profession. \"The attrition rate was really shocking.\" </p> <p>Four years later, when she was invited to give a lecture series on mathematical biology, \"I felt I could not in good conscience give six lectures without making some reference to my being a woman. So in the last lecture I developed an epidemiological model for women in science using the data I had collected in Stanford in 1970. I showed them the equations, and the birth and death constants\" - which predicted the rate at which women scientists would abandon their profession - \"and then I devoted the last few minutes to a review of the reasons for these difficulties. I decided that probably the most serious obstacle to the success of women was the widespread belief that science was an inherently masculine endeavour. Where did it come from? What consequences did it have?\" </p> <p>It was the first time she had asked those questions out loud and the consequence was a huge sense of personal liberation. Even telling the story 26 years on, much of her face disappears in a huge grin. \"In 1974 these were not polite questions. I went back to the motel that evening and wrote up the talk. It was the first story I ever sold\" - she shakes her hand in the air in a jubilant, cheque-waving motion. </p> <p>That was the beginning of her career as a feminist critic of science. Gillian Beer says, \"What's important is that she asks new questions, and she holds on to them in ways that other people don't. She will start with very bold, sometimes odd - I'd say maybe absurd, if that wouldn't be misunderstood - questions, and moves in from there with that great weight of intellect until she carry them through. We met because I wrote a rather mixed review of her Reflections On Gender And Science and she wrote back and we became friends It's very typical of the way she listens to how people respond to her ideas. But of course it is the sheer intellectual stamina that is most impressive.\" </p> <p>There is certainly a ferocious energy about Keller which the relaxed posture belies. She has a house on the edge of Cape Cod that she loves and where she gardens, and she keeps a kayak for voyages on the chilly Atlantic. </p> <p>One of her happiest memories is of teaching cross-disciplinary courses with her colleagues in the humanities at a small university town in New York State in the 70s. \"Since it was the 70s, you could ask any question you wanted. We were rethinking everything, including a new educational system\"; and in the process she caught up on all the things her scientific education had missed out, reading literature, anthropology, and philosophy. She talks as if this period of blossoming radicalism was about the most fun she ever had in her life. </p> <p>Today, walking through the streets round MIT, once a centre of radicalism, she seems a figure from a long-past era among the hurrying, brightly efficient students, some of whom greet her respectfully. \"They are all so entrepreneurial these days\" she says. \"But when an MIT student goes radical, they really are radical,\" and she laughs at the thought. </p> <p>But even though it is a powerhouse of capitalism now, the atmosphere at MIT remains extraordinarily informal, in ways she fits right into. The faculty lunchroom is a kind of 50s cafeteria, with some of the smartest people in the world eating off paper plates at plain deal tables; after lunch she took a cardboard mug of coffee outside and sat on a bench to enjoy the autumn sunlight, asking a student to move up and make room for her. This mixture of sensual relish and intellectual stringency makes her company rather disconcerting; it would not be very pleasant to be a student who she decided was not trying. </p> <p>The trouble is that like so many revolutionaries she sees her followers going further than she thinks they should. For she still believes in science. It's no use saying , as some do, that science is a purely cultural construct, like art or fashion, because that does nothing to explain why it works and helps us change the world with a precision and power that no other human activity can approach. She doesn't even think there is any special way that women do science differently from men. On the other hand, she believes it is grossly misleading to pretend that science has no cultural element in a way that actually holds back scientific progress. </p> <p>Language which is seen as transparent becomes impervious, she says, and holds people back from the complexity of the phenomena they are trying to understand. The consequence is that both men and women do science less well than they might. These arguments came together, in a huge stroke of good luck, in her study of the maverick geneticist Barbara McClintock, who won the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1983, whom she had seen, as from a great distance, in her lab at Cold Spring Harbor in the summer of 1960, when Keller was converted to molecular biology. </p> <p>McClintock had worked there, solitary among the crowds, since 1945. Her speciality was the genetics of maize, a plant to which she remained faithful throughout the decades when almost every other geneticist had moved on to simpler and faster-growing organisms. But, by the detailed and patient study of patterns in individual plants as they grew, McClintock had been able to discover, on her own, two hugely important parts of the genetic mechanism: she identified genes which controlled the activity of others, placed further along the chromosome; and she saw how these regulated genes could \"jump\" from one part of a chromosome to another. She called this \"transposition\". </p> <p>It took her six years to work it all out, and when she presented her results to her peers, no-one understood them. Nearly 15 years later, they were independently rediscovered in bacteria by molecular biologists, and McClintock was acknowledged as a pioneer; but by this time the habit of solitude was well entrenched and she continued to feel isolated by her interests and understanding of the world. </p> <p>Keller's biography of her, A Feeling For The Organism, started off as a study for the New Yorker. But it grew into a full-scale biography, which appeared five months before McClintock won her Nobel Prize (she died in 1992). The moral seemed simple: that women could only succeed in science, as McClintock had, by sacrificing everything else in their lives. </p> <p>Keller says: \"By her own account, even as a child, McClintock neither had nor felt any need of emotional intimacy in any of her personal relationships. The world of nature... became the principle focus of both her intellectual and emotional energies. From reading the text of nature, McClintock reaps the kind of understanding and fulfilment that others acquire from personal intimacy.\" But Keller was also interested in whether McClintock gained a deeper intellectual understanding of the world through this emotional connection. This is sometimes also a plea for a more holistic understanding of the world, not because it is spiritually improving, but because it is in some respects scientifically enlightening. It can make our knowledge of the world more precise and reliable, which is, of course, the opposite of what holistic normally means - fuzzy and new age. </p> <p>Keller's latest book, The Century Of The Gene, argues that the idea of the gene, which carried science through to such huge advances in the last century, will not do so well in this one, as more and more is learnt about the ways in which strings of DNA actually work in the world, and the complexities of their interactions with surrounding cells. </p> <p>On one level it is a beautifully illustrated examination of the arcane ways in which particular, meaningful stretches of DNA are pulled out of a chromosome which is, so far as we know, 97% meaningless \"junk\", and assembled into the kind of genes that actually specify the proteins that build people and every other living thing. On another, it is an attack on the view that genes are agents which do things to the passive world around them and are solely responsible for changing it. Lewis Wolpert, professor of biology at London University, a conspicuous opponent of Keller, attacks her for talking \"junk\" and \"bullshit\"; but at the same time says her thesis is \"what everybody knows\" and cries \"So what!\" when specific points are raised. </p> <p>The row between Wolpert and Keller is a wonderful example of the kind of antler-locking into which academics of all sexes naturally fall in a world where simply agreeing with someone can seem an unforgivable insult. One of Wolpert's themes is that the philosophy of science has absolutely nothing to teach working scientists. So when he gave a talk to this effect in Cambridge, England, and cited all the wonderful work which was going on in the laboratory without any help from philosophers, Keller rose at the end and said she agreed entirely with the importance and interest of this work - but why had he left his own laboratory to join in the science wars? The consequence was, first, that he heckled her next lecture in London, and then wrote a pamphlet attacking it. </p> <p>\"I suppose she wants a feminist interpretation of the gene,\" says Wolpert. </p> <p>But the only thing feminist about Century Of The Gene is that she works in the territory familiar to another woman philosopher, Mary Midgley, an admirer of her work, where the metaphors that scientists use are taken seriously. These are dangerous borderlands; metaphors such as \"selfish genes\" can take on a life of their own among non-scientists, who take them to meant things that their creators never intended. But Keller, as a scientist herself, is more interested in the effect that metaphors have on the way that scientists see the world, and the sort of possibilities that they lead them to explore, or to exclude. </p> <p>This is, if anything, even more unpopular among working scientists than are questions about the effects of their language on the outside world. It's quite easy to come to terms with the idea that stupid, ignorant people - non-scientists - might misinterpret the language that scientists use. It is more threatening to suppose that scientists themselves might be misled. Yet this has been the thrust of all Keller's recent work; and in The Century Of The Gene, she looks at the possibility that the word \"gene\" itself has outlived its usefulness. For the century she has in mind is not the one just opening, with its promise that genetic engineering will transform the world and our understanding of it, but the 20th century, just over, when all the theoretical discoveries were made. </p> <p>\"At the very moment in which gene-talk has come to so powerfully dominate our biological discourse, the prowess of new analytic techniques in molecular biology and the sheer weight of the findings they have enabled have bought the concept of the gene to the verge of collapse,\" she says. \"It's been a growing conviction of mine that biologists have a whole other way of talking to each other in the lab than they do to the public.\" </p> <p>All the information in a cell is contained in its genes, or at least in its DNA. But this begs the question of what exactly information is, and whether it can exist on its own, self-sufficient as God. Keller believes that without a context, it is meaningless. Because genes are switched on and off in response to the circumstances of the cell around them, a \"genetic program\" cannot reside solely in the genes. </p> <p>She is certain to make more enemies by challenging the view popularised by Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins that the gene is the motor of evolution. \"Before you can talk about natural selection, evolution had to arrive at a system that would endure for long enough for natural selection to operate on,\" she says. But she has never worried about voyaging alone through uncharted seas of thought. Her self-confidence remains extraordinary: a woman with a big laugh happily paddling her own kayak through the ocean, just because she thinks it fun and interesting.</p> <p> \u0095 The Century Of The Gene is published by Harvard, price \u00a315.95.</p>",
  "<p>Indian cricket's ruling body last night suspended five players named in the Central Bureau of Investigation's match-fixing report, as British detectives prepared to fly to the subcontinent to gather further evidence into the allegations. </p> <p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India banned Mohammad Azharuddin, the former Test captain, and four other players from international and domestic matches. The suspensions will remain in force while the BCCI carries out its own inquiry into the scandal. </p> <p>The president of the board, AC Muthiah, said the move did \"not as yet\" amount to a life ban but promised tough action if the findings went against them. The other players suspended are Ajay Jadeja, Ajay Sharma, Nayan Mongia and Manoj Prabhakar. </p> <p>\"We have asked all state associations to suspend them,\" Muthiah said. \"The CBI has carried out a painstaking exercise.\" The BCCI's own investigation would take \"about 15 days\", he added. </p> <p>Sir Paul Condon, the head of the International Cricket Council's Anti-Corruption Unit, has already been in touch with CBI officials, Muthiah said. Two detectives from his squad are expected soon in New Delhi. </p> <p>Sources hinted that two players, Azharuddin and Sharma, are likely to be banned for life, with lesser punishments for Jadeja, Mongia and Prabhakar. Only Azharuddin and Jadeja still play for India. The ban will make little difference to the Indian line-up, as neither player has been selected for the forthcoming Tests against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. </p> <p>More names may yet emerge from the CBI's investigation. Officials have refused to discuss reports that a second England player, as well as Alec Stewart, may be involved. Lord MacLaurin, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, yesterday reiterated his statement that, \"if there is any suspicion against any of our England players and they fail to come and talk to me or any or my colleagues about it, they will be suspended.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile the all-rounder Craig White, who scored his maiden century for England against a PCB Patron's XI, denied the allegations against Stewart had affected squad morale. \"We're giving him heaps of support trying to help him through. We'll put it behind us and concentrate on the cricket,\" said White. </p> <p>Yesterday the New Zealand cricket board announced it would set up an inquiry into the report's allegations, while in Sri Lanka, the former vice-captain Aravinda de Silva admitted being approached by bookmakers but denied accepting any money.</p>",
  "<p>Look away now if you don't want to know the score. Tonight Manchester United will not be appearing on Match of the Day. At least neither Sir Alex Ferguson nor any of his players or backroom staff will allow themselves to be interviewed after the game at Coventry City. All season the United manager has refused to cooperate with the nation's favourite football show, ordering the rest of his staff to keep mum too. Not even the former United man Garth Crooks, armed with one of his trademark 15-clause questions, will be able to scale the wall of silence. </p> <p>The big chill began when Ferguson read a suggestion in Match of the Day magazine which accused him of being a bully. He has, though, had disputes with the show before - in 1993 he went quiet after pundits criticised the total exclusion zone he had placed around Ryan Giggs - and BBC executives were hopeful this one could be resolved as quickly as in the past. After all, they pointed out, the magazine has no editorial links with the programme beyond a shared title. </p> <p>As the stand-off developed, negotiations took place at the highest level on both sides. Peter Kenyon, United's chief executive, was said to be keen on a thawing in relations and, through careful diplomacy by intermediaries, a resolution appeared to have been reached early last month. Word came through the day after England played Germany that normal service would be resumed the following Saturday. </p> <p>Then Ferguson read newspaper extracts from the Radio 5 Live commentator Alan Green's book about the pair's lengthy spat (they have not exchanged a civil word since Green made characteristically combative remarks about Roy Keane during the 1995 FA Cup semi-final). As a response to the Green book Ferguson raised the ante, issuing a blanket ban on all contact with the BBC. Radio and television, local and national, the silence from players and management at the country's top football club is absolute. </p> <p>Ferguson is understood to believe there is an anti-United bias at the corporation involving Green, the ex-Liverpool duo of Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson, and the former editor of Match of the Day Brian Barwick, a Liverpool fan. It is a belief that remains unshaken even though the current Match of the Day editor, Niall Sloane, is a United fan and the editor of Match of the Day magazine, Tim Glynn Jones, is such a keen red that he used to run the Shankhill Skinhead, an Old Trafford fanzine. Not forgetting Greg Dyke, the top man at the Beeb, who is so fond of the club that he used to be a United director and has spent the past few weeks trying to call in a few favours on his programme's behalf. </p> <p>United haters, of course, may not be so troubled by the silence. And even United fans would presumably prefer a testy grump who wins everything rather than a media darling who wins nothing. </p> <p>So how much does the disagreement between Ferguson and the Beeb really matter? Compared to Kosovo, Gaza and the state of the nation's transport infrastructure, not a lot. But the spat is symptomatic of a rapidly changing relationship be tween those playing and those reporting on football that has serious implications. </p> <p>For Ferguson is not alone in being in dispute with sections of the media. While few have gone quite as far as the former Dundee United chairman Jim McLean, who is under police investigation for an alleged incident with a BBC reporter, there are plenty of others grinding axes. </p> <p>The Manchester City manager Joe Royle still refuses to conduct post-match press conferences if anyone from the Liverpool Echo is present, because of what he describes as a vendetta against him when he was Everton manager. Duncan Ferguson has not spoken to a single journalist since he felt the press gloated at his prison sentence for head-butting an opponent. </p> <p>While there are many in the game who remain open, helpful and polite - it would be hard to find any journalist with a bad word for Jim Smith or Gareth Southgate, for instance - sulks and silences, spats and scraps are becoming ever more regular. One seasoned football reporter reckons that, in 20 years' experience, he has never known an atmosphere as tetchy as the present one. For fear of losing access, he believes, many of his colleagues have become cowed, sycophantic and simply dare not ask the challenging question. The possibility of forming mature relationships with managers or players is a thing of the past. </p> <p>\"Trust,\" he says, \"simply does not exist in football any more.\" </p> <p>The connection may not be obvious but all this is tied up with Middlesbrough launching their own website this week, with Chelsea publishing their own magazine and with Manchester United appointing a director of communications. Clubs are fighting for complete control of the lines of information. They want to communicate directly with their fans without interference from an independent third party, the press. Increasingly, if players and managers have something to say, they say it not via the established media but in club magazines, serialised autobiographies or on their own websites. </p> <p>And why not, the clubs will ask. If there is no trust left, whose fault is that? Newspapers devote huge amounts of space to what is known in the dressing room as \"slaughtering\" players: in the tabloids it is stories about their private lives, in the broadsheets (including this one) it is speculative analysis of their characters. Arsenal's Thierry Henry probably spoke for many when, at the launch of his new website recently, he said his motive was primarily to ensure his fans got the story he wanted them to hear, unfiltered by the distorting prism of the media. </p> <p>But there is something else at work here. There is a widespread assumption in football that the media is making an unjustified killing out of the game, that money is pouring into the pockets of journalists, photographers and broadcasters which rightly belongs to the players, managers and chairmen. The lure of the personal website has as much to do with the financial implications of being able to market a player's image as it does with freedom of information. </p> <p>Money certainly seems to have been at the root of a one of football's longest-running battles between Michael Knighton, when he was chairman of Carlisle United, and the local paper, the News and Star. </p> <p>\"He was very sensitive of criticism of the club,\" says Keith Sutton, the paper's editor. \"He was very upset when we reported that he claimed to have seen a UFO at a motorway service station but the thing that finally made him see red was when we printed a special souvenir supplement after Carlisle got to Wembley in the Sherpa Van Trophy. He was very jealous of that, felt we were taking money that belonged to him. So he banned us from the stadium. Of course, it didn't work; we took copy from freelancers. Finally he got so fed up with us, he published his own paper called Borders On Sunday. It only lasted four weeks.\" </p> <p>By contrast, on the other side of the Atlantic, sporting franchises a good deal larger than Carlisle United offer the kind of access to players that the British media can only dream of. This is not because the Americans are better disposed to the press but because they are contractually obliged to be available. Players accept that media duties come with their elephantine pay cheques. And team PR officers ensure the arrangement runs smoothly. Here club PRs seem to believe that the most important part of their job is ringing up to challenge opinions offered in match reports (\"when you wrote our full-back has two left feet, were you being entirely fair?\"). </p> <p>In such an environment of distrust, and with commercial pressures rising all the time, rapprochement looks impossible - meaning that balanced, objective coverage of footballing matters may soon become endangered. </p> <p>As for the Match of the Day spat, staggeringly, despite the \u00a373m over four years that the BBC pays to cover the game, it has no contractual pull: interviews on the programme are a matter of informal understanding. And, if anyone at the BBC thinks the dispute with Ferguson will blow over soon, they should take note of what happens in the true home of football . . . </p> <p>Emerson Leao, Brazil's new national coach, took exception to a story about himself in Placar, a popular football magazine. So exercised was he that he vowed never to speak to anyone at the magazine again. That was 15 years ago and he has been as good as his word: the ban stands. In Brazil even the sulks are world class.</p>",
  "<p>The total sums for the cost of the damage wrought by this week's storms, floods and high winds are still being calculated, but look likely to be around \u00a3500m on insurance policies - and much more for damage not covered by insurance. </p> <p>Insurers have been inundated with claims this week, such as the one Eagle Star received for a house in Cheltenham which had just been fitted with a new roof, the whole of which was blown off. Or the customer in Kent who was shocked to see their neighbour's chimney crash into their garden and land on a wrought iron table. Or the instance of a lawnmover which was blown over a fence and into the next door garden. </p> <p>The most common claims this week have been for tiles blown from a roof, often causing damage to a car or other property below, flooded cars and chimney stacks collapsing. </p> <p>Eagle Star says that most of its recent claims have come from the Birmingham area and have been for an average of \u00a3500. </p> <p>But what should you do if your home is hit by an ill wind or hellish high water? Are you covered, and are you going to face a long slog ar guing with the insurance company? </p> <p>One thing that few people will be able to claim for is wrecked garden fences - hardly any policies cover them. </p> <p>Direct Line says that storm damage is automatically covered by its buildings and contents insurance, which covers outbuildings, garages and sheds but does not include fences, trees or gates. Eagle Star will cover the tree but not the fence; it will be up to you to check the terms of your policy. </p> <p>Most insurers provide emergency 24 hour helplines to deal with immediate enquiries, giving details of approved carpenters, plumbers and electricians to deal with repairs in your area. But Jeffrey Salmon of Salmon Assessors makes the point that you should always take it upon yourself to minimise the damage, even if that means calling a plumber without the nod from your insurer. </p> <p>\"Do not depend on your insurer - they may take up to three weeks to do anything about your claim. In the meantime you must mitigate the damage as soon as possible or it could get worse. Insurers are obliged to pay for any work you have done which is deemed to have mitigated your loss.\" </p> <p>Eagle Star says it pays bills directly to the supplier and that no claims form is required - the process is conducted over the phone. But for larger repair jobs the contact should have been made with the insurer before you commission the work, or you could end up paying for it yourself. </p> <p>In the case of large claims, that is for \u00a31,000 or more, the insurer generally appoints a loss adjuster to manage the claim. The loss adjuster is supposed to be independent, but is appointed by the insurance company and so presumably will be trying to keep the amount paid out to a minimum. You could consider countering this by appointing a loss assessor who works for the policy holder to maximise the payout. </p> <p>They work on a no-win, no-fee basis, and usually take 10% of the amount paid \"although we generally increase the claimants payout by around 30%,\" says Mr Salmon. Find your local loss assessor in the Yellow Pages. </p> <p><strong> Roof damage</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Always use plastic sheeting or a tarpaulin to prevent water leaking through a storm damaged roof. </p> <p>\u0095 If the damage consists of just a couple of tiles which have fallen, it may be advisable for you to pay for the repairs yourself - although remember that a call out charge alone can be as much as \u00a350. Rebecca Hadley, of AA Insurance Services, says that if you make more than one claim in a year, you will either lose your no-claims bonus or your premium will be increased by an average of 20% (which amounts to the same thing) the next year. The AA's policies include an emergency repairs clause, however, which mean you can charge upto \u00a3170 of repairs to it in a year without sacrificing your no claims status. </p> <p>\u0095 If the roof shows signs that it was already in a bad state of repair the damage, says Direct Line, is unlikely to be covered. </p> <p>\u0095 If tiles fall off and hit a car, the damage should be covered by motor insurance, provided it is fully comprehensive, although again, if the damage is not too great, it may not be worth sacrificing your no claims bonus or paying the excess. </p> <p>\u0095 If the tiles damage someone else's property or vehicle, you cannot be held responsible for this, unless it can be proved that you failed to maintain your roof. </p> <p><strong> Flood damage</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Turn off your electricity and gas supply and have the respective companies check your connections before you turn them back on. Your insurance should cover the cost of this. </p> <p>\u0095 Collect water in buckets and where ceilings are bulging with water you should pierce the plaster with a broom handle to let it through. </p> <p>\u0095 Hire one or more dehumidifiers and keep them for as long as necessary, which could be three weeks or more. \"If you get wet rot six or seven months after a flood, you will find this is not covered by insurance,\" explains Mr Salmon. The insurer should, however, pay for the hire of the dehumidifier. </p> <p>\u0095 Dry out carpets and soft furnishings but don't lift fitted carpets as they may shrink. </p> <p>\u0095 Take photographs of everything. </p> <p>\u0095 Do not throw anything out. Water damaged goods should be put in black plastic bags or covered up, but never discarded as the insurer may send a third party to come and survey the damage. </p> <p>\u0095 In flood prone areas you should listen out for alerts of any further flooding. You could also raise furniture and valuables to avoid damage and keep sandbags, warm clothing, a torch and a radio to hand. </p> <p>\u0095 If your car is flooded, do not attempt to move it. Phone your insurer and if you have fully comprehensive cover, this is covered. The insurer will call a garage to have it towed away and dried out. Some policies provide courtesy cars, although Direct Line does not.</p>",
  "<p>House prices fell again last month and the average home is now worth just 5.7% more than a year ago, according to Halifax. </p> <p>But the comments yesterday from Britain's largest mortgage lender are in sharp contrast to the latest survey from rival Nationwide, which said this week that prices rose in October and are now 9.9% higher than a year ago. </p> <p>British house prices fell by 0.4% last month, the fifth monthly fall so far this year, and the average price now stands at \u00a386,121, Halifax said. </p> <p>The annual rate of house price inflation has fallen to 5.7%, the lowest figure since May 1999, it added. </p> <p>In January this year annual price inflation was running at 16%. But a spokesman said: \"The prospects for the housing market over the remainder of this year and during 2001 are relatively bright despite the slowdown experienced since the beginning of 2000. </p> <p>\"Critically, housing demand should continue to be underpinned by a sound economic background and affordability levels that are broadly in line with long-term averages nationally. </p> <p>\"Nonetheless, economic growth is likely to slow over the coming quarters, which will constrain housing demand and therefore house price growth.\" </p> <p>Figures from the inland revenue confirm the slowdown in the housing market: property transactions in England and Wales fell by a seasonally adjusted 6% in the period July 1 to September 30.</p>",
  "<p>Credit card companies are privately slapping hefty fines on rogue websites for misusing people's card details amid a big jump in complaints about internet fraud, it emerged this week. </p> <p>Much of the problem centres on \"adult\" websites and other disreputable merchants, most of which tend to be based in America or offshore locations such as the US Virgin Islands, that are fleecing credit card-holders in the UK and around the world. </p> <p>Britain is a mecca for credit card fraudsters. Incredibly, more than half of all credit card transactions in Europe take place in the UK and more than half of Europe's card fraud happens here too. And the growth of shopping on the web has the potential to make matters worse. </p> <p>This week, British and US regulators added to fears over net purchases when they warned web users to watch out for internet fraudsters. Officials said they were taking action against more than 250 cyber conmen, mainly in the US, who have been tricking gullible web users. </p> <p>Mastercard/Europay, the international payments organisation, disclosed to Jobs &amp; Money that since June it has fined around 30 websites, many of them sites selling pornographic images and goods, which have generated the largest number of disputed online transactions. </p> <p>Mastercard/Europay carried out research into where credit card disputes - such as alleged fraud and complaints about unsent goods - were arising, and found that about 50% of them related to e-commerce. And about half of these e-commerce disputes related to adult websites. </p> <p>One of the most popular scams operated by US-based adult sites involves requests for users' credit card details, either to pay a \"one-off\" subscription fee or simply to act as proof that customers are over 18. The individual does this, and then he or she finds they are being charged $25-$30 every month by the site - a regular payment they clearly haven't agreed to. Attempts to get the unauthorised payments stopped run up against toll-free phone numbers that only work in America, with no address to write to. </p> <p>Other sites, some of them auction and holiday websites, are taking credit card numbers and passwords and using them to go shopping at major online retailers that might have been visited by the customer. Research shows that people tend to use one password for all their online shopping and rogue sites exploit this fact. They take the card details and password and visit sites that only need a password before allowing customers to shop. CDs and other goods can be bought in large numbers and sent on to an address in another country. </p> <p>So what can the victims do? The fact that it may involve porn means some people will be too embarrassed to contact their bank or credit card company to try to get the matter rectified. Some will simply cut up their card, which is immensely frustrating for the card companies, for whom losing customers is an expensive business. </p> <p>MasterCard/Europay is now hitting back, and earlier this year put in place a policy where if the number of disputed transactions exceeds a certain amount for two consecutive months, it fines the website's bank (it can't fine the sites directly). And these are no token penalties either - the fines start at $5,000 and rise to a hefty $100,000. The October fines were the most severe yet imposed, and are expected to lead to a crackdown on guilty sites. </p> <p>\"Nearly all the people on the list [of those fined] have been what you would call disreputable merchants,\" says Paul Lucraft at Mastercard/Europay. They are all based in America or offshore America. </p> <p>Mr Lucraft stresses that Mastercard/Europay is not mounting a moral crusade against adult websites. \"It just happens to be that a number of the people who are ripping off the system are hiding behind these sites.\" It probably costs the porn sites \"a few cents\" to post images on the net and they are collecting perhaps $30 a month from hundreds or thousands of individuals, he adds. </p> <p>Lack of confidence in net security is deterring millions of people from buying on-line. Future Foundation, a think-tank, says that security topped the list when it asked people what they consider the most important service criteria. It quizzed 1,000 people and found that 76% of non-internet shoppers say that when they do come to make their first online purchase, they will want to deal with brand names they trust - not least because of widespread fears about security. </p> <p>Measures are being put in place to give consumers greater protection against online fraud. Government rules came into force this week which give new rights to people who shop via the internet, phone or mail order. </p> <p> Ministers have amended the Consumer Credit Act so that people are no longer liable for the first \u00a350 when someone uses their credit or debit card to make fraudulent purchases. There is also a new seven-day cooling-off period during which you can change your mind and have your money refunded. </p> <p>In this climate of concern, some companies are now offering nervous net shoppers peace of mind for a price. A company called CPP (Card Protection Plan) recently launched \"e-shopsafe\", described as the first comprehensive insurance policy designed to protect internet shoppers against fraud. It costs \u00a310 a year and covers shopping done via any secure site worldwide - but it may only be worth con- sidering if you do a lot of shopping from over-seas websites because some of the protection it offers is already provided within the new UK rights that came into force on Tuesday. </p> <p>Ms W, a marketing manager from York (she didn't wish to be identified), took out an e-shopsafe policy after she bought a book about environmental volunteer holidays over the internet - but later found her credit card details had been used by a fraudster to buy pornography. </p> <p>Two months later, three transactions appeared on her statement for amounts under $30 that she most definitely didn't recognise. \"When I looked closely I was horrified to see the name of the retailer I had supposedly shopped with. There was no doubt as to what they sold.\" </p> <p>She was eventually reimbursed for the fraudulent transactions but the incident has severely dented her confidence. \"I was surprised at how easy it all seemed for the fraudster. It has also made me more vigilant in checking my credit card statements.\" </p> <p>Parool Patel, a freelance public relations director, was the victim of a similar (non porn-related) incident earlier this year when his statement showed US dollar purchases he had not made. He wondered if it might be internet-related as he had only recently been browsing the net for books and CDs. He contacted the card company which put the transaction into a \"dispute account\" and has heard nothing since. \"I presume they have resolved the fraud or absorbed the cost,\" says Mr Patel. </p> <p>In the longer term, a number of further measures are planned to combat card fraud, both online (which accounts for a small but growing percentage of total card fraud losses) and offline. The UK banking industry is currently rolling out a new generation of \"smart\" credit and debit cards containing computer chips but it's proving to be an agonisingly slow process. Though the roll-out commenced 18 months ago, currently only around 10m of the 120m cards in circulation have chips. </p> <p>These new cards are more difficult and costly to counterfeit than traditional cards with a magnetic strip on the back, which are falling foul of a fast-growing problem called \"skimming\", where fraudsters copy data from a genuine card on to a blank card without your knowledge. </p> <p>This might happen in a restaurant or bar where a crooked waiter takes your card away when you pay and secretly copies it. This is what happened to Adam Mason, 26, a consultant at a London sports marketing company. A few weeks ago he suddenly found he couldn't obtain cash from an ATM with his Barclaycard. When he called the company, they said they had put a block on his card because its fraud office had noticed his plastic had been used simultaneously in London and Morecambe - someone had run up a \u00a3400 bill in two days at various stores in the Lancashire town using a counterfeit card containing his data. </p> <p>Adam had only recently made his first online purchase and initially believed this to be the source of the fraud, but he now reckons it was a result of a visit to \"a particularly dodgy bar\" where he had put his card behind the counter and had never received a receipt. Barclaycard fully reimbursed Adam and also recovered the counterfeit card, and he is full of praise for the way it sorted out the matter so quickly. </p> <p><strong>Tips for foiling fraudsters</strong> </p> <p>Here we identify the online fraudsters' tricks of the trade and offer some advice on how to avoid their clutches. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The password trick:</strong> A crook running a rogue website takes a customer's credit card number and password to go shopping at major online retailers that might also have been visited by that person. Many people use the same password for all their online shopping, so the crook will go to sites that only need a password before they allow customers to buy goods. Armed with the person's credit card details, they can then go on a shopping spree. </p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use different passwords on different sites. Also, just as you wouldn't give your credit or debit card details to someone you don't know, make sure you trust the online retailer, says CPP, a company specialising in credit card protection. \"Check out an unfamiliar site before you buy,\" it adds. \"Do they have a secure site? Do they provide full address and contact details, not just a mobile phone number? Which trade organisations is the company a member of?\" Secure sites typically display a padlock symbol on your screen when you are entering your details. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The multiple debit trick:</strong> Asking visitors to the site to pay a \"one-off\" fee which turns into a regular amount charged to your credit card every month. </p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> As we explain in the main article, the sites notorious for doing this are US-based porn sites, so you're clearly dabbling in dangerous waters and some people will have little sympathy for your predicament if this happens to you. If you are going to deal with a website that asks for such a one-off fee, make sure there is a contact phone number that works and check for a full address on the site. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The undelivered goods trick</strong> </p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The advice above applies here too. You've got a better chance of sorting the matter out if the site is in the UK - at least it will be covered by our laws. As we have highlighted, new rules came in this week giving greater protection to people who shop online. One of the new rights is that if you haven't received the goods within 30 days, you are entitled to your money back, unless both parties have agreed to a longer period or alternative goods/services are supplied and you accept them. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The email sales trick:</strong> A site that has your card details emails you with an offer to \"upgrade\" the service you receive. It says this will cost you perhaps an extra $19.99 a month and that if you don't reply within X days it will automatically start deducting the amount from your credit card. You do not get the message in time - it might be an old email address or you're on holiday - and you end up with a regular payment going out that you haven't authorised. </p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Check your emails regularly if you subscribe to a site that has your card details. And go through your credit card statement with a fine-tooth comb.</p>"
