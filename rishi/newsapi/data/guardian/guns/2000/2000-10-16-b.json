  "<p>Halifax tried to pull a publicity stunt yesterday saying it will not increase premiums for any of its buildings and contents policy holders as a result of the flooding which has hit parts of the country.</p> <p>Unfortunately the offer is not as generous as it seems. MoneyUnlimited contacted other big UK insurers, including Direct Line and Nationwide, and found that none of them had any intention of raising premiums either.</p> <p>In addition, a spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers said it would be unusual for insurers to hike their premiums as a result of the floods because the damage has not been widespread. </p> <p>Insurers base premiums on the number of claims they've had across the whole book of business. If the entire country had been flooded premiums would probably go up, but as only a handful of each insurers' policyholders will be making claims, the companies can absorb the losses without having to increase premiums.</p> <p>That's the good news. The bad news is that there are lots of ways for insurers to justify premium increases, so don't be surprised if yours does actually rise when you come to renew your policy.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Halifax said: \"We will not increase premiums as a direct result of the floods, but there are other factors, including changes to tax and legislation, which we take into account when setting premiums.\"</p> <p>In short, insurers could increase premiums across the board and blame the rise on a variety of factors as long as the floods are not one of them. Halifax and the other insurers were unable to say if other factors would lead to premiums increases, only reiterating that increases would not be because of the floods.</p> <p>Stuart Cliffe from the Association of Bank and Insurance Customers said: \"Halifax have gone a step too far with this move. The whole point of insurance is that it protects you against one-off events, so when a one-off event like flooding happens why should customers worry about premiums increases. It's almost fraudulent to make claims like this in the hope of getting new customers. Insurers can never guarantee rates won't increase because anything can happen and lots of issues affect the premium.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the floods have once again raised the issue of climate change and the impact it will have on the insurance industry. </p> <p>Environmental campaigner Friends of the Earth has been talking with the industry explaining the link between burning fossil fuels, climate change and destructive weather patterns in the hope that insurers will see it is not in their long-term interests to insure oil companies as their activities result in huge losses for the insurers. </p> <p>And the industry itself is starting to take notice. Andrew Dlugolecki from CGNU has been working on the links between climate change and insurance losses for some time and says he was expecting flooding like the ones witnessed in recent weeks. \"The industry will be working closely with developers and planners to make sure the three million new homes to be built in the next 20 years are not built in flood prone areas,\" he says, before adding \"climate change is obviously a factor as well and the insurance industry needs to accept this.\"</p>",
  "<p>Almost ten years to the day since then environment secretary Michael Portillo gleefully \"topped out\" the steel cap to Canary Wharf, the Docklands monument to capitalism has come of age. In a low-key announcement yesterday, the stock exchange confirmed that Canary Wharf is to join the FTSE 100 index. </p> <p>It has been a long, bumpy road, but the tallest building in Britain is finally winning acceptance. The main tower at 1 Canada Square is 99.9% full, two more towers are nearly finished and Canary Wharf has this week agreed to take control of a further slice of land on the bank of the River Thames. </p> <p>A recent surge in the company's share price has taken the value of Canary Wharf to \u00a33.8bn, which means the family of chief executive Paul Reichmann is sitting on a stake worth \u00a3255m. The group is even considering a bid for the site of the Millennium Dome. </p> <p>However, it has hardly been an easy ride. On the windy November day in 1990 when the tower was completed, Mr Portillo declared: \"The prophets of doom, with their nonsense about white elephants, have already been proved wrong.\" </p> <p>He was soon to swallow his words, as the site's Toronto-based developer Olympia &amp; York put Canary Wharf into administration. It became a symbol of the unsustainable excess of Thatcherism. </p> <p>Too many buildings had gone up in London, causing a collapse in rents when the economy slowed down. It was years before demand for office space caught up with supply. Canary Wharf acquired an image problem that it has never truly shaken off - of soulless nightlife, poor transport links and hostile surrounding neighbourhoods. </p> <p>Yet for all its critics, Canary Wharf has bounced back. Mr Reichmann, the former boss of Olympia &amp; York, led a consortium which bought the company back for \u00a3800m five years ago. </p> <p>Since then, the company has been helped by the continuing growth of the financial services sector and more recently, the birth of thousands of dot.com companies in search of space in central London. </p> <p>Consolidation among banks and stockbrokers has created larger organisations in search of bigger buildings than ever. Canary Wharf has been able to respond more quickly and cheaply than its rivals, partly due to the underground infrastructure of pipes, networks and plumbing laid by its ambitious founders. </p> <p>Meanwhile, developers finally appear to be running out of space in the Square Mile. Just 2m sq ft of offices are due to become available in the City in the next six months - a figure which has fallen 52% in the last year, and is at its lowest level since 1988. </p> <p>Property analyst John Atkins of HSBC says: \"There is a growing shortage of office space in central London, more particularly of high quality space, and more specifically in large units.\" </p> <p>Surging demand has allowed Canary Wharf to bring forward its plans and it will complete the next stage of its development - towers for HSBC and Citigroup - early next year. </p> <p>Mr Atkins says: \"The one advantange they've got above all the others is speed. They know exactly what's under the ground - they don't have to worry about any archeological remains, unlike the City, and they can throw things up quickly and not too expensively.\" </p> <p>Canary Wharf's estate is creeping out towards both edges of the Isle of Dogs. In its latest expansion, the company yesterday said it was paying \u00a334m to buy out Singapore-based Pidemco and Hotel Properties, its joint venture partners in a riverside site to the west of the main Canada Square. </p> <p>This will provide space for further shops and restaurants - the group is anxious to counter complaints that the area is a graveyard for entertainment. In fact, it already has 130 shops and is classed a \"sub-regional shopping centre\". Most of the main bar chains are in evidence. A Canary Wharf insider boasts: \"You can never get into All Bar One here these days - it's heaving.\" </p> <p>The extension of the Jubilee Line has been crucial in attracting new businesses. In the early days, Canary Wharf was only served by the Docklands Light Railway, which stopped in the early evenings and never ran at all over the weekends. </p> <p>The arrival of the tube has been one of the only indisputable improvements for local communities. For, despite its belated financial success, critics point out that Canary Wharf has struggled to fulfil one of the original aims of the Thatcher-inspired enterprise zone - to help lift Docklands out of poverty. </p> <p><strong>Tall storeys 12 towering years</strong></p> <p><strong> May 1988</strong> Construction begins at Canary Wharf </p> <p><strong> August 1991</strong> State Street first tenant to move in </p> <p><strong> May 1992</strong> Canary Wharf's developer, Olympia &amp; York, goes into administration </p> <p><strong> October 1993 </strong> Rescued by consortium led by Lloyds Bank </p> <p><strong> October 1994</strong> Working population reaches 10,000 </p> <p><strong> December 1995 </strong> Sold for \u00a3800m to group including current boss Paul Reichmann, Prince al Waleed and Franklin Resources </p> <p><strong> February 1996</strong> IRA bomb explodes at nearby South Quay, killing two people </p> <p><strong> November 1997 </strong> Tony Blair holds summit with President Chirac at Canary Wharf </p> <p><strong> April 1999</strong> Flotation values Canary Wharf at \u00a32.2bn </p> <p><strong> September 1999</strong> Jubilee line station opens </p> <p><strong> September 2000 </strong> Canary Wharf makes first full-year profit </p> <p><strong> October 2000 </strong> Joins FTSE 100</p>",
  "<p>New Contemporaries is an annual exhibition selected from the work of students and graduates of fine art degree courses in the UK. Hosted by the Cornerhouse for the sixth year running, the 33 successful artists have been chosen by Sarah Kent, visual arts editor of London magazine Time Out, Jeremy Millar, a freelance curator, and artist Gavin Turk. Damien Hirst, a previous New Comtemporaries exhibitor, is one of the project's patrons. </p> <p>Much of the work here seems to harbour a fascination with urban-pastoral landscapes or concepts. Can we take the city to the country and vice versa? Josephine Butler's huge atmospheric photographs of peaty groves could depict October days in any rural area, but she tells us in the title that they are all somewhere in the City of London. With the industrial detritus of bricks, hose-pipes, buckets and glass, James Ireland sets up Tableau, a DIY waterfall, cheekily based on an accompanying photograph of the real thing. </p> <p>Beata Veszley, meanwhile, brings animals to the city by constructing five life-size plastic horse-heads replete with manes and glass eyes. She mounts these on wooden poles and the viewer is encouraged to step inside the cast and wear one like a mask. If you're with a friend, equine conversations are welcomed. </p> <p>Of the video installations, Nikolaj Larsen's Love is a fuzzy-pictured shot of a couple kissing in the rain, with a maniac occasionally shouting \"I love you\" in the background. It is at once intimate and horrible. Also intriguing is Vali and Ameneh by Johannes Maier, a chat between two bilingual Iranian speakers, and you have to listen carefully to hear them slip between the colloquialisms of the two languages. If the video work seems to wisely eschew political content, then this is counteracted by Phil Collins's How to Make a Refugee, a two-screen documentary showing a lifestyle magazine photographing refugees. In a rather obvious indictment of the media, Collins clearly reveals the humiliation of the young boy being photographed. </p> <p>Of course, there is much playfulness on show too. Edward Weldon's small but chunky oil paintings of envelopes, cash tills, and skips are grubby delights, while Cable Car by an artist known simply as Eric is a life-size model in wood. Jennifer Beattie's sculpture, Beautiful Tree, is made of varnished branches which look like barbecued ribs and boast Sellotape clusters for blossom. It might sound like a Blue Peter special, but it's rather stunning. Also striking are Marta Marce's post-Hirst canvases of bold lines and spirals.</p>",
  "<p>New Zealand stretched their necks at the death yesterday to beat India in the ICC Knockout Trophy final, a match in which they were chasing all day, and secure their first major one-day competition. Led by a brilliant unbeaten century from Chris Cairns, they won with two balls to spare, showing yet again that a well-organised team can punch above its weight in one-day cricket. </p> <p>Sourav Ganguly was both the hero and villain for India. He scored a spectacular 117 from 130 balls but ran out the flower of his batting - Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid - and so contributed to a total at least 40 runs shy of what had earlier looked likely. </p> <p>After disappointing crowds throughout the tournament Nairobi's large south Asian population turned out in force yesterday, greeting every run and wicket with uproar. </p> <p>Tendulkar showed the way early, driving good-length balls and cutting anything remotely short. During his innings he became the heaviest scoring one-day batsman ever but he was run out for 69 when Ganguly called for a sharp single, then changed his mind. The innings faltered towards the end but their 264 still looked enough. </p> <p>Nathan Astle and Roger Twose thought differently, attacking with gusto as the Kiwis raced to 61 off the first 10 overs. But two wickets apiece from Venkatesh Prasad and Anil Kumble put them on the back foot at 109 for four, at which point Cairns took control. </p> <p>Despite a knee injury he batted first for respectability and then upped the tempo, putting on 122 with Chris Harris. Cairns brought up his century off 106 balls and, by the time Harris fell for 46, the deficit had been reduced to 11 runs. Three were required when Ajit Agarkar started the final over and, as the crowd chanted \"we are losing it\", Cairns and Adam Parore picked them off in singles.</p>",
  "<p>George Weah's marriage of convenience with Manchester City is teetering on the brink of divorce after he demanded talks with Joe Royle that are likely to precipitate his departure from Maine Road. </p> <p>Weah is scheduled to meet the City manager this morning and the likelihood is that his contract will be terminated after he indicated that he is unwilling to stay at Maine Road unless he can be guaranteed first-team football. </p> <p>This was the fourth match of the season that he has been left on the bench and for a man of his amour propre, a weekly salary of three, four or five times that of his team-mates is only intensifying his frustration. </p> <p>Indeed, only three months after becoming the highest-paid player in City's history he has let it be known that he has become disillusioned with Royle. </p> <p>Weah failed to make a scheduled appearance as the guest analyst on a Granada football show last night and Royle, having emphatically denied there was a problem 24 hours earlier, confirmed they would be holding talks. \"I'll be meeting George to discuss his future,\" he said. </p> <p>The unlikely figure of Paul Dickov is keeping Weah on the bench and he vindicated Royle's faith with another excellent display against beleaguered Bradford, scoring with a sumptuous strike to open the scoring after 30 minutes. </p> <p>Coincidentally, City will take a duster to its trophy cabinet this week and clear a gap among the gleaming relics of happier days for a new keepsake: the patch of Wembley grass where Dickov scored that goal 94 minutes into their Second Division play-off final against Gillingham. </p> <p>The snorts of derision emanating from Old Trafford no longer rankle quite so much. For City, it was that moment more than any other that can be traced back as was the catalyst for their remarkable transformation. The turf will be watered lovingly </p> <p>Two-and-a-half years on and Dickov's longevity is surprising everyone - not least Weah. The man who could not hold down a regular place in the Second Division two seasons ago is now the man who is keeping the former World Footballer of the Year on the bench. </p> <p>\"I never have a wage sheet with me in the dug-out,\" Royle stated before the extent of Weah's disaffection became more widely known. \"Because George is the star, there will always be questions asked when he is left out. But Manchester United have Dwight Yorke on the bench and no one makes a fuss of it. </p> <p>\"There will be times when George plays and times when he doesn't. But that goes for everyone. Kevin Horlock is an international player and he was on the bench as well.\" </p> <p>Comparing Weah to Horlock is similar to assessing the different merits of Pavarotti and a karaoke champion but everyone knew what Royle meant. City are ego-free and happy to stay that way. </p> <p>Besides, if possession is nine tenths of the law, Dickov's case would no longer be laughed out of court. The indefatigable little Scottish international striker has added a new dimension to his game and his volleyed goal, catching a dropping ball with the outside of his right foot, illuminated an otherwise murky affair. </p> <p>\"Even now, at the age of 27, he is still learning,\" said Royle. \"It was a goal that would probably have gone in the stands a couple of seasons ago.\" </p> <p>Functional rather than inspirational, Royle's men should survive with something to spare if they can avoid suspensions and injuries. Otherwise this could be a First Division fixture next season. </p> <p>So far this season Bradford have averaged a league goal every three hours 37 minutes and once Alfie Haaland's shot had deflected in off Stuart McCall to double the lead just before half-time the win bonuses could have been counted out there and then. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "<p>And the next one please. Fulham duly dispatched Blackburn Rovers yesterday afternoon to extend their perfect start to the Nationwide season to 10 games. On this form it is hard to see anyone preventing Jean Tigana's team stretching that run to 46. </p> <p>By common consent, there is no other side in the First Division on the same plane as Fulham when it comes to \"playing football\". Though Rovers ran the London side close in the second half, there was always an inevitability about the result, even against a side who themselves spent \u00a34m on players over the summer and were the pre-season favourites to win the division. </p> <p>The partnership forged between Tigana and Mohamed al Fayed has, it seems, all but guaranteed Fulham's return to the top flight for the first time since they were relegated from the old First Division in 1968. The team's immediate aim, however, is to beat Reading's league-record start to the season of 13 wins. </p> <p>If they do eventually go up, Fulham will be the most heavily bankrolled side to graduate since Blackburn themselves, eight years ago. Al Fayed has forked out \u00a320m on players since arriving at the club and, like the late Jack Walker at Rovers, has discovered that money can buy success. </p> <p>More cash will be needed to make an impact in the Premiership, but Al Fayed's pockets are bottomless and Fulham can emulate Blackburn who, three years after being promoted, were league champions. </p> <p>The Frenchman Tigana has shown himself to be not so much a quick learner about British football, as possessed with the strength of character to impose his own views on how the game here should be played. His team, back on top of the division, are all comfortable in possession, imaginative in their passing and movement and willing to run at opponents with the ball. </p> <p>Confidence has grown and though they went behind to a fourth-minute goal, Fulham hit back with such an array of attacking options that Rovers were bamboozled. As a result they sat far too deep and allowed the home side to control the midfield. </p> <p>The player who best took advantage was Fabrice Fernandes, a two-footed 20-year-old left-winger on loan from Rennes whose skills caused Rovers all sorts of problems. </p> <p>Tigana believes in width, and on the other wing the strength and pace of the former Chelsea player Bjarne Goldbaek was equally devastating. Combined with the runs and turns of the front two Luis Boa Morte and Barry Hayles, the Rovers defence were left in a right old spin. </p> <p>All this after Blackburn, seeking their first away win since March, had taken the lead when Matt Jansen was allowed to waltz through the Fulham defence and plant the ball past Maik Taylor. </p> <p>Jansen then nearly put Noel Blake in for a second, before Fulham got a grip and equalised through Fernandes. Jeff Kenna allowed him to run into the area and fire a shot which John Filan should have stopped but which nonetheless nestled in the net. </p> <p>Hayles then went close on several occasions before the break, Fernandes shot just wide and the referee Uriah Rennie declined Fulham what seemed a penalty when Gary Flitcroft brought down Lee Clark. </p> <p>But once Rovers had sorted out their midfield in the second half, they went close to taking the lead. Blake headed just over, Craig Hignett hit the bar and Stig Bjornebye forced Taylor into a rare save. </p> <p>Ironically, it was during this period that Fulham scored again. Goldbaek fed Louis Saha and the division's leading scorer, on as a substitute, was felled in the area by Henning Berg. Saha duly converted the penalty for his 11th goal of the season, to keep Fulham on the road to the Premiership. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "Liberal Democrats in Wales yesterday seized the long awaited opportunity of putting their policies into practice in government by voting overwhelmingly in support of a three year partnership agreement with the minority Labour administration in the Welsh assembly. <p>The junior partners in the new coalition will take up two seats in the nine strong assembly cabinet in a reshuffle due to be announced by Labour first secretary Rhodri Morgan today. </p> <p>As part of the new arrangement the Liberal Democrat leader in the assembly, Mike German, will become deputy first secretary. Discussions on the division of cabinet portfolios were taking place between the party leaders last night. </p> <p>The coalition, modelled on the agreement between the two parties in Scotland, is due to remain in force until the next assembly elections in 2003. </p> <p>It was thrashed out in secret talks earlier this month in a bid to usher in a period of stable government in Cardiff following the turbulence that has marked the past 17 months of minority rule. </p> <p>The agreement, which triggered the resignation of the Labour education and culture secretary, Tom Middlehurst, in protest at the offer of cabinet seats to the Liberal Democrats, is founded on a partnership document that includes many of the policies on which the Lib Dems fought the 1999 assembly elections. </p> <p>Despite the initial disquiet of some Liberal Democrat members at the clandestine nature of the discussions, delegates to the party's autumn conference yesterday voted 130 to 11 in favour of the deal. </p> <p>Labour assembly members and the Labour executive in Wales had already given their approval. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, hailed the vote as a good day for Wales and for devolution. He said the assembly now had the stability it had lacked. </p> <p>\"Today's decision will increase confidence in the assembly and allow it to deliver changes - most of them in the Liberal Democrat manifesto - which will make a real difference to the lives of the people of Wales.\" </p> <p>Among the initiatives to have been agreed is the recruitment of 700 teachers to help reduce class sizes for eight to 11 year olds, the provision of an extra \u00a360m to support farmers and rural communities, and an immediate investigation into student hardship and funding. </p> <p>Agreement has also been reached on a review of voting systems for local government elections in Wales with a committment to pressing Westminster to bring forward assembly sponsored legislation to implement the review's conclusions.</p>",
  "Half a century ago, Rumbek secondary school was the only secondary school in southern Sudan, and it was the pride of British colonialism. Its long, low brick classrooms were built around a large courtyard shaded by giant mango trees. <p>Catholic and Protestant chapels stood just beyond the central courtyard, with dormitories, a refectory, an orchard, a vegetable garden, offices and teachers' houses spread out over a large area; it was the orderliness of Surrey transported to one of the wildest parts of the empire to forge a new elite on the British model. </p> <p>\"This school was the manufacturer of the first generation of politicians in the south. All the officers of Anyanya 1 [the group of insurgents that led the first southern rebellion, which started in 1955 before the British left] passed through this school,\" said one graduate and a former commander of the organisation into which Anyanya evolved, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (the SPLA). </p> <p>As the rebellion grew in the south in the 1960s, schools were closed and Rumbek secondary, with all its pupils and staff, was taken to the north. When peace was signed between north and south in 1972, the pupils organised the immediate return of the school. </p> <p>\"We came down all together by train, leaving the teachers to follow,\" said one of the move's organisers, later to become an SPLA commander. </p> <p>Once war broke out in the south in 1983 following the declaration of sharia Islamic law by Khartoum, the school's brief life as the cradle of the southern elite ended abruptly; its grounds became a government military barracks. </p> <p>The soldiers built a mosque, and pulled down the outlying buildings and the teachers' houses. The empty chapels now have Arabic slogans written on the walls. A broken-down military truck occupies a corner of the courtyard, where the odd bullet shines in the dust, and the laboratories have become the kitchen, housing two great vats of sorghum porridge and broth for cooking soup. Dozens of vultures perch on the roof. </p> <p>Three years ago the SPLA took Rumbek town and, as the town began to revive, the people reopened the secondary school. \"We had to, it is the identity of the south, the nucleus of our struggle,\" said one teacher. </p> <p>The reopening was a community effort, but there were few resources. Last year when the harvest was good, the townspeople contributed food. But this year southern Sudan faces another serious food deficit and the people have none to give. The students' food must be bought using some of the \u00a330 fee each pupil pays a year. </p> <p>How their families find the battered and torn Sudanese pound notes in this society, where life is mainly subsistence farming and barter and most adult males are dead or in the SPLA, is a mystery. </p> <p>In the classrooms, the students sit on home-made bamboo chairs, packed 80 or 100 to a room. There are now 380 students, in their late teens to late 20s. The school has only nine permanent teachers and 11 part-time ones. Three of these were released from the military by the SPLA at the request of the headmaster. Most of them are graduates, but not trained teachers. None draws a salary, nor any equipment except for a very few books. </p> <p>The teachers' greatest frustration is not only the consistent lack of books, but the fact that the students are often completely unprepared. Although primary schools have been reopened in the liberated areas for several years, their standards are minimal. </p> <p>\"The children arrive here with no background. Their teachers are so poorly educated that it is often like starting from scratch with boys in their 20s,\" said one English literature teacher. </p> <p>He is teaching George Orwell's Animal Farm and Alan Paton's Cry the Beloved Country, the books he was taught and loved himself a generation ago. But to his class, even much of the vocabulary is new. </p> <p>\"We have completely lost the battle for education,\" said one priest. \"Suppose peace comes, how can we even begin to negotiate with the northerners when they have degrees and we are coming from the village?\" </p> <p>The older generation were so well educated in this school that it hurts them deeply to know the next generation have lost out so dramatically. </p> <p>\"Before the war we had the British Council giving us scholarships and teachers,\" said one teacher. \"What's happened to you people that you do not bother now, when we are so much in need?\" </p> <p>Oxfam and Unicef have dug pit latrines, provided a grinding mill and some exercise books. The school's main donor looks like being the US Agency for International Development, which has promised $300,000 (\u00a3210,000) for teacher training and curriculum development; it has emphasised the importance of including girls. </p> <p>Endorsing this, one foreign aid official declared: \"We want many, many Margaret Thatchers, and many, many Indira Gandhis to come out of this school.\" </p> <p>There are now just three girls in the school, one of whom is 29 and a mother of three. The second, a tall determined-looking young woman who speaks English as impeccably as the first generation of Rumbek students, wants to be a doctor. </p> <p>She is following a tradition in the south: the first female graduate, the first female commissioned officer, and the first female doctor all came from Rumbek. \"But this was before the war spoiled everything,\" said one teacher bitterly. </p> <p><b>How the war destroys normal life</b></p> <p><b> 1955</b> First rebellion by southern Anyanya insurgents (an event known as Anyanya 1) </p> <p><b> 1956</b> Sudan becomes independent from Britain </p> <p><b> 1972</b> Addis Ababa peace agreement between north and south </p> <p><b> 1981</b> Anyanya 2 rebellion starts in south </p> <p><b> 1983</b> Khartoum proclaims Islamic sharia law </p> <p><b> 1983</b> Sudan People's Liberation Army/Anyanya merge </p> <p><b> 1980s</b> SPLA takes large parts of south </p> <p><b> 1986</b> SPLA talks with northern opposition </p> <p><b> 1989</b> National Islamic Front military coup in Khartoum </p> <p><b> 1995</b> Asmara agreement brings northern opposition and SPLA together in National Democratic Alliance </p> <p><b> Sudan's long history of civil war means that:</b> </p> <p>\u0095 Successive generations of children - more than 3m - have grown up without access to adequate primary education.

  "Sudan is suffering one of the longest civil wars in the world. The conflict has gone on there ever since independence from Britain in 1959, with only a short hiatus between 1972 and 1983. <p>Southern Sudan, home to more than 6m people, has been the centre of hostilities, but the war has spread to the north and east of the country as well. Two million Sudanese have already died due to the conflict. A further 4m people are estimated to have been displaced, primarily from the south, but also from northern areas such as Kordofan. Around 2m of them live in miserable conditions in camps around Khartoum and other cities in the north. </p> <p>Chronic conflict has destroyed the social fabric - the institutions sustaining food, security, education and healthcare - in the south, leaving two generations of Sudanese dependent on relief. It has also made them vulnerable to the war economies that sustain the conflict. Poverty is extensive, deep and growing. Underdevelopment has become institutionalised. Southern Sudan now constitutes one of the most glaring examples of development failure in the whole of sub-Saharan Africa. </p> <p>The tragedy and scandal of Sudan's poverty and underdevelopment is not that nothing can be done, but rather the opposite. Many of the country's problems can be addressed. Key aspects of development can be promoted, especially people-focused development. Despite severe constraints, civil society and community institutions in southern Sudan have arisen and undertaken notable initiatives. Even in the context of continuing war and conflict, non-governmental agencies have access to most of the people for most of the time, and have attempted to expand their activities from relief to longer-term development. There are sizeable pockets of peace within southern Sudan where such development investment does not risk being disrupted by fighting. </p> <p>Local development initiatives can be supported, people can be trained and educated, community institutions and administrative structures can be built and strengthened, and poverty can be reduced. The lack of books, of pencils and chalks, a lack of trained teachers, the absence of teachers' pay, and the lack of an effective administration have stopped children from learning in southern Sudan. More than one generation of children has been denied the right to education in the south. We cannot and must not allow further generations of children to be denied their right to education, too. </p> <p>Many donors, including Britain's Department for International Development, will provide only limited development funding while the war continues. They may have coherent arguments to defend this policy: they may wish to avoid the diversion of aid towards further military purchases fuelling the war, and to use aid as a lever to move the warring parties towards a peace settlement. </p> <p>Our interpretation of the British government's current policy of reduced development assistance while the war continues is that it has done little to further the pursuit of peace. It cannot be justified once its real costs are measured in terms of the deepening poverty and suffering of the southern Sudanese. </p> <p>There is a growing body of civil organisations in Sudan investing in the development of their war-ravaged communities; they could receive increased assistance to sustain their efforts. Investment in longer-term development, particularly in education and health services, would sow the seeds for peace and prepare a generation of people to build reconciliation and peace once an agreement is reached. Development is essential to reduce the need for relief and to lay the foundation for peace. Development is imperative to give hope to generations of Sudanese who have little to look forward to now. </p> <p>Britain has a particular moral responsibility to be at the forefront of international development efforts in southern Sudan - because of its historical links with Sudan, because of its stated commitment to poverty reduction and education for all, and because of its commitment to human rights. </p> <p>We British non-governmental organisations working in southern Sudan acknowledge the British government and the EU's recent efforts to review their policies on aid to Sudan and urge them to expand their development assistance significantly. We call for a three-track approach from the British government. </p> <p>The government needs to sustain and step up its efforts to promote a negotiated solution to the conflict, based on the Igad declaration of principles [agreed by the government and rebels in 1993 as a basis to negotiate peace], on behalf of the people of Sudan. The government needs to sustain the provision of humanitarian assistance to people still in dire need, respecting the obligations of international humanitarian law. </p> <p>We call urgently on the government to respond now to the development disaster in the Sudan, and to provide people-centred development assistance to help lay the foundation for a sustainable future for the people there. This should be provided through local civil society and other bodies, and not through any warring party. </p> <p>Without increased assistance from the government and the EU, the current work done by non-governmental agencies supporting peoples' livelihoods, building resilience, reducing vulnerability to conflict and addressing development need will remain inadequate. </p> <p>We urge the British government to be in the vanguard of international donor efforts to tell the story of southern Sudan's development disaster and to respond to it with vigour. We can - and must - address the problem now. </p> <p> Roger Riddell is the international director of Christian Aid. David Bryer is the director of Oxfam in Britain</p>",
  "In an office on the edge of Balata refugee camp, Hussam Khader keeps a nickel-plated Kalashnikov on his desk, an amulet for the men trooping in with assault rifles and bullet-proof vests. \"These people are going to fight with the Jews, but it is my job to use that in the negotiating table,\" the Palestinian official said. <p>That combustible mix of guns and talk, born in the back streets of refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza, comes into the full glare of international diplomacy today when Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, sit down with world leaders in Egypt to try to end 18 days of violence. </p> <p>Yesterday, Mr Barak said he would insist at the summit that the armed militias of Mr Arafat's Fatah faction, called the tanzim, which means organisation in Arabic, be disbanded, and that freed Hamas and Islamic militants be returned to Palestinian jails. </p> <p>Can Mr Arafat comply? Amid the wreckage of the peace process, many Palestinians believe that force is their only means of equalising the gross imbalance in international support and firepower between them and Israel. </p> <p>That argument is expressed most forcefully in Nablus, a stronghold of Hamas, as well as the tanzim. </p> <p><b> Hardliners</b><br> </p> <p> Officially, the tanzim operate with Mr Arafat's sanction, but there are no guarantees he can rein them in. Key figures in the tanzim preach a far harder line than the Palestinian leader, and want to seal off his options of returning to negotiations. They are seeking alliances with Hamas, and other Islamist groups which have opposed the peace process from the outset, and are now calling for violent action. </p> <p>In addition, the refugee camps are full of armed men whose allegiance is unclear. \"Most of the Palestinian people have a gun like you have a degree certificate from the university hanging on the wall,\" said Mr Khader. </p> <p>In Balata, where posters of the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein now hang as a symbol of Arab defiance, the tanzim leaders say they have just begun to fight. They predict a long and bloody guerrilla war against Israeli soldiers, and armed extremists in the 145 Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. </p> <p>The tanzim raised their first militia of 500 armed men in Nablus a week ago, and it has already been blooded in clashes with local Jewish extremists. Additional chapters are being raised in Gaza and in the West Bank cities of Jenin, Hebron and Ramallah. </p> <p>On the other edge of Nablus, which sits in a bowl formed by the surrounding hills, other forces are stirring. A day after his release from prison, Jamal Mansour, the Nablus leader of Hamas, is passing around a giant bowl of sweets to well-wishers. </p> <p>Detained for more than three years without charge at Israel's behest, Mr Mansour is edgy. Mr Arafat can order him back inside in an instant. Thirty-four Hamas prisoners were re-arrested in Nablus at the weekend. But for now, the Hamas leader believes he enjoys Mr Arafat's favour: among the callers on Saturday were several leaders from Mr Arafat's Fatah faction. </p> <p>\"Sometimes, in his mind, he needs signals to show he is still interested in the Palestinian national issue,\" he said. </p> <p>Such signals are Israel's greatest fear. When the Palestinian leader opened his jails on Thursday, hours after combat helicopters rocketed the perimeters of his Gaza headquarters while he was inside, Israeli officials accused Mr Arafat of giving a \"green light\" to Hamas suicide bombers. </p> <p>They also claimed he had released Mohammed Deif, the most dreaded Hamas bomber. </p> <p>That is untrue. Several dangerous militants, including him, were not freed, but transferred to house arrest for fear, the Palestinians said, they would be killed in additional Israeli attacks on their security installations. </p> <p>However, Israel remains in a state of high alert. </p> <p>\"It is clear that we have found ourselves in a situation where there is a great will to carry out a terrorist attack,\" Amos Malcha, the head of military intelligence said. \"It is possible that such an attack could interfere with a summit.\" </p> <p>For the Hamas, Mr Mansour is not revealing his hand. </p> <p>But he said: \"If there is still an occupation, what can we do? We will resist.\" That is his code for saying that the bombers have been activated. </p> <p>Although Israel says the resort to guns is inexcusable, it has an irresistible logic for the Palestinians. Under the terms of the peace process, the 30,000 armed police and security forces under Mr Arafat's control in the West Bank and Gaza are barred from turning their guns on Israel. He is also committed to easing Israel's constant sense of insecurity by keeping Hamas in check. </p> <p>The tanzim give him force, coupled with deniability. \"Officially, as soldiers in the Palestinian Authority, we can not use our guns against the Israelis because they will use this to attack us more and more. But if you have a militia made up of civilians, then the people will sleep well,\" said the Nablus tanzim leader, who would give only his first name, Nasser. </p> <p>Unlike regular forces, the tanzim are free to operate in areas of the West Bank under the control of the Israeli security forces. They also have an explosive charge, on a much greater scale than the last few days of skirmishes between the tanzim and settlers' groups would suggest. </p> <p>\"This is a game of chicken. It is saying: 'If you don't pull me back, I will go to the brink',\" said Khalil Shikaki, director of the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research. \"Hamas is Mr Arafat's playing card. But this is a very risky game because if Hamas has a massive suicide bombing, it could spell the end of the peace process.\"</p>",
  "The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, sat face to face at a table with the US president, Bill Clinton, and other leaders at the Middle East emergency summit in Egypt today. \"We have to move beyond blame,\" Mr Clinton declared. <p>The atmosphere this afternoon remained tense as clashes continued in the Middle East, while the two leaders, who have yet to meet bilaterally, gathered in the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.</p> <p>At the beginning of the summit, Mr Clinton declared: \"We cannot afford to fail.\" </p> <p>The sombre-faced leaders posed silently for photographs and Mr Clinton ignored a reporter's question about prospects for the meeting before making his opening statement. </p> <p>\"The future of the peace process and the stability of the region are at stake,\" Mr Clinton said, urging both sides to remember how far they had come since 1993 when they agreed to resume the peace process. </p> <p>The summit was called to end the recent mayhem on the West Bank and Gaza that has cost nearly 100 lives and fractured whatever trust remained between Israel and the Palestinians. </p> <p>On a key issue, Mr Clinton called for a fact-finding mission to probe the causes of the most serious fighting between the Israelis and Palestinians in years and to prevent a recurrence. \"We want to get negotiations started again,\" he said. </p> <p>The Egyptian president and host of the summit, Hosni Mubarak, called for \"saving what is left of the credibility of the peace process\". </p> <p>After Mr Clinton and Mr Mubarak made opening remarks, the meeting took a recess. </p> <p>Each country's team kept to itself. Mr Barak stood up and talked to his advisers. Mr Clinton turned in his chair to speak to the national security adviser, Sandy Berger, and the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright. </p> <p>The leaders sat about 10 feet apart around a horseshoe table, with Mr Clinton and Mr Mubarak sitting at the head of the table. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Palestinian militiamen opened fire on Israeli soldiers during two West Bank protest marches, and rock-throwing clashes erupted elsewhere in the Palestinian territories.</p> <p>Two Palestinians were seriously injured by Israeli fire, Palestinian doctors said. </p> <p>South of the West Bank town of Nablus, around 1,500 Palestinians marched toward an Israeli army checkpoint.</p> <p>Around 500 broke away from the march and began throwing stones at three Israeli army jeeps. Several gunmen, shooting from olive groves, fired on Israeli soldiers, drawing return fire.</p> <p>Eight Palestinians were injured in total, including the two who were in a serious condition with bullets to the head and chest respectively, said a doctor at a Palestinian field clinic. </p> <p>On the outskirts of the West Bank town of Ramallah, Palestinian gunmen opened fire on Israeli soldiers manning a checkpoint. </p> <p>Across the West Bank and Gaza strip, thousands of Palestinians joined protests against a renewal of contacts with Israel. </p> <p>With a little more than three months left in his presidency, Mr Clinton still hopes to broker a peace accord. But for this summit, the most optimistic outlook is for a truce and a date set for new negotiations between the two sides. </p> <p>\"We shouldn't give it all up for what has happened in the last few weeks,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Barak was first to arrive for the emergency summit at the Egyptian Red Sea spa report, followed by Mr Clinton and Mr Arafat. </p> <p>Also at the emergency summit were King Abdullah of Jordan, the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, and Javier Solana, the EU security chief. </p> <p>Mr Arafat, Mr Barak and Mr Clinton each met separately with Mr Mubarak before the summit gathering. </p> <p>Mr Clinton hopes to return home in time for a memorial service on Wednesday in Norfolk, Virginia, to honour the 17 US sailors killed in an attack last Thursday on a US destroyer at the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula.</p>",
  "<p><strong>GUNS, GOLF AND GREAT GAMES</strong></p> <p>At 10.29pm last night, Sander Westerveld was in Liverpool's trendy Jalons Wine Bar, debating whether to stay rooted to his seat or make a dash for the toilet. A minute later - with Westerveld still undecided - all hell broke loose. Three masked men burst into the bar and opened fire, wounding one man in the leg and another in the foot as the Liverpool keeper and five of his team-mates looked on in horror.</p> <p>Fortunately, none of the players were injured and they were later driven away in a mini-bus. A statement released by Liverpool FC this morning said: \"A number of players were enjoying dinner with their wives on Sunday evening at a restaurant they have previously visited a number of times when the shooting occurred. Markus Babbel, Didi Hamann, Sami Hyypia, Erik Meijer, Sander Westerveld and Christian Ziege all provided their details to the police before leaving the premises. The group were obviously shocked by events but were thankfully all unhurt.\" </p> <p>The two casualties were treated in hospital for their injuries, which are thankfully not too serious. The gunmen, who wore balaclavas, escaped in a silver Vauxhall car, which was later found burned out in nearby Greenbank Road. Police are asking anyone with any information to contact them.</p> <p>Westerveld makes no mention of the shooting in his consistently entertaining website column today. \"Personally, I like to think I am on something of a winning streak at the moment,\" he says, blissfully ignorant of the fact that he could have been killed. \"Before we played Derby I managed to win at golf on my computer!

But sadly, it possibly looks as though we may have made a slight misjudgement, perhaps, because Weah has been released from his two-year contract with immediate effect.</p> <p>The former world player of the year and AC Milan legend had become disillusioned at his amazing inability to push Paul Dickov and Paulo Wanchope down the first-team pecking order. Having to sit on the bench for the duration of Saturday's win over Bradford wouldn't have helped his mood, and watching Dickov turn into a better version of Ronaldo for the day may have been the last straw. Crisis talks were held during the past 48 hours, with divorce the inevitable result.</p> <p>\"It is not a situation I thought would arise,\" Weah said today with a knapsack on his back. \"However, having spoken to Joe Royle, we have amicably agreed it would be best for both parties to terminate my contract. I will review my own situation at a later date.\" Meanwhile, Joe Royle remained surprisingly calm. \"It is always regretful when things do not work out between club and player.

Heck, even the paper with which he has an exclusive weekly column - \"he talks, you listen\" - has come out in favour of the former Portsmouth boss. But when it comes to garnering support for the \"impossible job\", what you really need is the endorsement of a top building society. And today, Tel got it.</p> <p>\"We understand what people might say about the connection between us and England if Terry Venables got the job,\" said Chris Hull, spokesman for the Nationwide building society, sponsors of Team England, and eminently qualified advisors on issues of financial probity. And football coaching. \"They are not looking for an accountant or director of finance,\" Mr Hull said. \"They are looking for a national coach and I think the FA will choose the right man.\" And if not then they can forget about getting the best mortgage at the lowest rate.</p> <p>Of course, Mr Hull's musings were to be expected - they're simply one way of making sure Nationwide get value for their sponsorship money. (Imagine a board meeting in five years' time: \"Gentlemen, over the past six months we have seen increasing losses leading to the threat of bankruptcy. But on the bright side, I think we got the formation right against Albania\".) But how does one explain away this ringing endorsement, from a more unexpected source? \"As a football coach I am told that Terry Venables is one of the best around and from what I have seen I don't disagree,\" Alan Sugar said this weekend.

His new look Real Madrid took advantage of Celta Vigo's 1-1 draw at home to Alav\u00e9s to go top of the table with a comfortable 3-0 victory against champions Deportivo la Coru\u00f1a at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u on Saturday night. (Although some would no doubt argue that replacing the skinny, floppy-haired floating midfielder Steve McManaman with the, er, skinny floppy haired floating midfielder Guti hardly represents a new look). </p> <p>Ra\u00fal opened the scoring with an almost apologetic finish from Figo's run and cross, Hierro converted a penalty after Roberto Carlos was brought down, and on-form Guti wrapped it up in the second half, scoring his forth of the season with a header (ok, so there is a difference between Guti and Macca). </p> <p>The Madrid fans' delight must have been tempered by the scores coming in from the Basque Country, though. Rivals Barcelona were busy filling their boots, handing out a 6-0 thrashing to Real Sociedad at the Anoeta Olympic Stadium.</p> <p>The home side were undone in just forty minutes. The star of the show was Portuguese winger Simao, who has shown so far this season that he may just about be able to step into Luis Figo's shoes, if not his bank account. It was he who beat Aranzabal for pace, creating an easy opener for Rivaldo. Alfonso, Barcelona's summer signing from Betis, added two more in quick succession, shooting home after a Luis Enrique corner on 16 minutes and beating Mattias Asper from distance five minutes later.</p> <p>Real appeared to give up at that point. Rivaldo, from the penalty spot, Luis Enrique and Simao completed the scoring before half time. Even Real Sociedad's magnificent second-half clean sheet couldn't placate the fans, who booed their side from the field. </p> <p>The result was a huge blow to Javier Clemente, the man Spaniards love to hate. He now looks set to become the second managerial casualty of the season after Zaragoza's Juan Manuel Lillo - sacked after his side threw away a 4-1 second leg second half lead in the Uefa Cup.</p> <p>Perhaps scared that what goes around comes around, Barcelona manager Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer wouldn't criticise Clemente's side, insisting that the result was a reflection of \"our quality not their failings.\" Mind you, the ex-Betis coach, another manager under pressure, would say that: rumours continue to suggest that he is soon to be replaced by Valencia coach H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper or ex-Chelsea boss Gianluca Vialli.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Valencia, like Celta, passed up the chance to move to the top of the table, only managing a 1-1 draw at newly promoted Villarreal. Meanwhile, Real Mallorca picked up their first win of the season, coming from behind to beat Racing Santander 2-1. Las Palmas (as in Vinny Samways) defeated M\u00e1laga by the same scoreline, and delighted fans were treated to torrential rain and no goals between Espanyol and Rayo, Zaragoza and Valladolid, Numancia and Athletic and Osasuna and Oviedo.</p> <p>Attention now turns to this weekend's 'derbi' encounter between Real and Barca. And what attention. Readers of the Spanish sporting press will be subjected to merciless hyperbole for the rest of the week and beyond. We'll see who sits next to who on Madrid's flight to the Catalan capital, what the scores were in the training-ground five-a-sides, and every other piece of pointless information you could wish for.. </p> <p>Real Madrid captain Fernando Hierro somewhat inevitably claimed that Bar\u00e7a's 6-0 victory \"doesn't scare us.\" Maybe not, but team-mate Luis Figo may be just a tad nervous. 'The world's most expensive player'\u0099 is in line for a hot reception in the Camp Nou, where Real Madrid haven't won for seventeen years. </p> <p>Barcelona president Joan Gaspart insists he will suppress his \"true feelings\" in the directors box, but wouldn't make any guarantees about the supporters, or \"cul\u00e9s\": \"who am I to say how the fans should behave?\" he said. \"I hope they express how they feel, that they are true to themselves ... Figo should be made to realise that in life you simply can't do what he did to us.\" </p> <p>Rumours in the Spanish press suggest that over 300,000 whistles will be distributed to Barcelona fans keen to welcome Figo back. Questions must remain over the Catalans' ability to count, though - the Nou Camp's capacity is only around 90,000.</p>",
  "<p>Vivendi, the French media and telecoms group, yesterday agreed to sell its 23% holding in BSkyB as a means of gaining approval for its \u00a366bn merger with Canada's Seagram. </p> <p>The European commission set three conditions as it gave approval to the creation of what will be called Vivendi Universal. It has already been cleared in the US. </p> <p>The business will span mobile phone networks, the Universal Hollywood studios, Universal Music, internet portals and pay television in Europe. The deal had been hailed in June as the first European media group which could meet rivals in the US eye to eye. </p> <p>The agreement to divest the BSkyB shares ends what has on occasion been an uncomfortable relationship between Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation controls the company, and Jean-Marie Messier of Vivendi. </p> <p>The divestment, which was announced yesterday morning, had little effect on the BSkyB share price, which closed up 7p at 907p. The sale could also mean that Vivendi will no longer become a significant shareholder in Sky Global Networks, the holding company for all of Mr Murdoch's satellite pay-television businesses which is due for a stock market flotation later this year. </p> <p>Mr Messier hinted that he could still play a part in the new SGN company, however, and said: \"All doors remain open\". BSkyB's link to the Fox film studios through News Corp was the EC's main cause for concern. Vivendi has two years to sell its stake. \"We will take our time and examine together with Rupert Murdoch the best way to exit from BSkyB for both us and News Corp,\" Mr Messier said. </p> <p>The divestment, he added, would be made with a view to maintaining \"the excellent quality\" of their relationship. </p> <p>Under the second EC stipulation, Vivendi must offer to rival pay-TV operators access to Universal's film output . It has guaranteed that its own pay-TV operation, Canal+, will not hold first rights to more than 50% of Universal's film production. </p> <p>The Canal+ commitment covers the French, Belgian, Italian, Dutch, Spanish and Nordic countries over a five-year period. The third issue was Vivendi's multi-access internet portal, Vizzavi, which caused competitive concerns over the emerging online music market. To answer that worry, Vivendi will offer rival portals access to Universal's online music content, also for five years. </p> <p>Last year Mr Messier attempted to broker a merger between Canal+ and BSkyB but the talks ended in acrimony over which side would emerge in control of the combined operation. Mr Messier then rattled Mr Murdoch by building a stake of 25% in BSkyB, which has since been diluted by new shares being issued. Relations between the two men though are said to have warmed. </p> <p>A BSkyB spokesman said: \"Vivendi has been a very supportive shareholder over the past year. We now intend to enter into discussions with Vivendi with a view to ensuring an orderly disposal of their stake.\" </p> <p>The deal cements Mr Messier's position as one of the most powerful media figures worldwide. Since he took the helm of what was then G\u00e9n\u00e9rale-des-Eaux in 1996, Mr Messier has reshaped the utility as a media and communications business. </p> <p>Seagram's Universal music publishing business is the largest in the world and includes artists Boyzone, Elton John and Shania Twain, while its film business has scored hits with The Mummy and Gladiator. </p> <p>Its television arm produces shows including Xena Warrior Princess and has a library of programmes such as Kojak, Murder She Wrote and Miami Vice providing a wealth of content for Vivendi's pay-TV networks.</p>",
  "The second big presidential debate was like nothing so much as the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava in 1854. Instructed to seize the guns, the 600 rode suicidally in the wrong direction, and Al Gore did the same when he faced George Bush in Boston. The guns he seized were his own. He sacrificed his superior knowledge and experience on all aspects of policy. He fell over himself to assure the watching millions that he agreed with Bush on this and that. And when Bush laid himself open to charges of ignorance and hypocrisy, Gore spared him. <p>It was the most depressing spectacle and a disservice to the several million fence-sitters who will decide who will be the next president. </p> <p>How did it come about? Everybody and the polls agreed the day after the first debate that Gore won easily. Then three things conspired to change the result, manifest in a sharp rise in the polls for Bush. First, instant replay. When it came to anything other than a vacuous generalisation in that first debate, Bush was open mouthed like a fish gasping for air. The trouble was Gore showed his contempt by rolling his eyes and shaking his head. In the week following, television replayed this image without illustrating the provocation. \"Where were the man's manners?\" became a staple of conversation, instead of focusing the question on Bush: \"Where was the man's mind?\" </p> <p>Next, the Dick Cheney-Joe Lieberman encounter. The press and the Democrats had written off Cheney, but he scored big time. His directness and dry wit were much more convincing than the treacly lovefest Lieberman initiated with his friend \"Dick\". It was hailed as a gentleman's discourse but it had no virtue except that, for the Republicans, it blurred the differences. </p> <p> And then, the Republican war room swung into action and scored a major success with a lazy press. Once again, caught in story mode syndrome, they pounded a drumbeat all week on the narrative line that Gore is a liar. </p> <p>Gore's staff panicked. They made him watch a parody of his debating style from television's Saturday Night Live. They abjured him to avoid anecdotes where he might misstep. Gore would indeed have been well advised to make a small correction in his style towards deference, but he over-compensated. Unlike Bill Clinton, he is tone deaf to nuance. He did not merely control his facial reactions; he put his brain on ice. He grovelled. He was utterly out of character for two-thirds of the debate and it represented a sell-out to his convictions. There were cheers across the land when he woke from his sycophantic narcolepsy, but it was too late. </p> <p>And now to the campaign on lying that so rattled the Democrats. The first thing to note is that the people calling Gore a liar are liars themselves. The Gore \"lies\" are not so much lies as irrelevant and inconsequential misremembering of circumstance. No, on one particular visit to a Texas forest fire he was not accompanied by the director, but by a deputy. But yes he did visit Texas disaster areas many times and that was the point. </p> <p>The main attack by the Republican spin machine has proven false itself. Gore quoted a newspaper report about a girl who had to stand up because she had no desk at school. The school principal, embarrassed by the revelation, denied it and the credulous national media accepted that denial as evidence of a Gore fib without any further inquiries. In fact, as the Sarasota Herald Tribune has made clear, a dramatic budget cut has high school students going without desks for weeks. Good politics for the Republicans maybe, but lousy journalism. </p> <p>The most sickening thing about the Republican fib factory is that while the moralisers have been regurgitating the propaganda, they have ignored really substantive lies by Bush. Forget amazing small errors like saying, with glee, that Texas would execute three men for a hate crime, when it's two men, and he is supposed to stand aloof pending appeals. There are examples of his mendacity - or his faculty for memory-loss and myth-making - that will affect people's lives. He said in the debate that he is in favour of hate-crime laws, but he has rejected them in Texas. He asserted that the percentage of people insured for health was going up in Texas but down nationally when both have risen. He described the Kyoto agreement on global warming as imposing controls only on the US, but it is multilateral. He says he is for clean air, but has given in to the polluters in his own state. He said he favours checks on guns bought at shows, but rejects the three-day waiting period that would enable them to be effective. He says he will pay for popular new programmes by using a quarter of the budget surplus, but his own budget shows he has allocated less than half that much. </p> <p>Will the real Al Gore stand up before America sells itself short to the spinners? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The European Commission's clearance of the AOL and Time Warner merger was a complex, drawn-out process which had commentators guessing and double-guessing the outcome until they tied themselves into knots. But no-one came near predicting the outcome of the \u00a366bn corporate marriage between the French media company, Vivendi, and Seagram of Canada, the owner of Universal studios. To get to the altar, Vivendi was forced to serve divorce papers on one of its key interests: British Sky Broadcasting.</p> <p>Vivendi has agreed to sell its 23% holding in the company over the next two years to assuage EC concerns that Vivendi Universal, as the new company will be known, will not link up with Fox studios, which is a sister company of BSkyB as Rupert Murdoch owns both. Attention will now turn to one of the more fractious relationships in the media world: that between Mr Murdoch and the Vivendi chairman, Jean-Marie Messier.</p> <p>Sky said: \"Vivendi has been a very supportive shareholder over the past year. BSkyB now intends to enter into discussions with Vivendi with a view to ensuring an orderly disposal of their stake. Any disposal has no effect on the fundamental business success of BSkyB.\"</p> <p>But the rapport between Mr Murdoch and M Messier has cooled over the past 12 months since an attempt to merge Canal Plus, Vivendi's pay-TV arm, and BSkyB foundered on disputes over who would control the company. The relationship seemed to be warming up recently after Mr Murdoch made conciliatory noises in press briefings, but the EC has thrown things up in the air again.</p> <p>The centre of the dispute has been Vivendi's role in Sky Global Networks, the company formed by the satellite TV operations in Mr Murdoch's News Corporation. M Messier had threatened to sell his stake in BSkyB unless Mr Murdoch allowed it to be converted into shares in SGN. M Messier has now been forced to give up a useful lever against his rival.</p> <p>The Frenchman is now a very powerful global media player, and Mr Murdoch's star may be waning, but SGN is a significant global satellite platform which will be the ideal carrier for Vivendi Universal's masses of content. A stake in SGN, which is expected to float at the end of the year, will confirm M Messier's ascendancy. The tenacious owner of News Corp has already shown his willingness to share out interests in SGN by selling 4.7% of it to US cable giant Liberty Media.</p> <p>The rest of the concessions forced out of Vivendi and Seagram have fewer ramifications. The second stipulation states that Vivendi must offer other pay-TV companies access to Universal's film output, which includes blockbusters such as The Mummy and Gladiator. A recent deal between the cable operator, NTL, and Universal Studio networks to set up a UK movie channel shows this is already being done.</p> <p>The third issue covers Vizzavi, Vivendi's pan-European, multi-access internet portal, a joint venture with Vodafone. Seagram*s Universal music publishing business is the largest in the world and Vivendi has promised it will offer rival portals access to Universal's online music content for five years.</p> <p>This final concession might leave the music companies, EMI and Warner Music, feeling hard done by, as the combination of internet access and back catalogues was enough to put their proposed merger on the back burner. However, Vizzavi has barely 1m subscribers at the moment and Warner Music found it hard to settle concerns over its links with AOL, which came from parent company Time Warner. Vizzavi's potential customer base is 80m, thanks to the presence of Vodafone and Vivendi's Cegetel telecoms subsidiary, but the EC clearly did not think it was of paramount inportance.</p> <p>It has been an exhausting process for M Messier, but the deal marks a stunning turnaround for his company. When he took over as chairman in 1996, Vivendi was predominantly a utilities firm. Four years later, it is one of the world's most powerful media conglomerates and only the AOL Time Warner merger has managed to overshadow it, though it may struggle to keep Vivendi Universal out of the limelight.</p>",
  "<p>How are businesses gearing up for the new consumer power that is emerging from the electronic revolution? I did some research for Marketing Forum 2000 to find out, and discovered real dilemmas for marketing and businesses. </p> <p>The research, which was conducted among both marketers and consumers, found that the rules of marketing haven't changed fundamentally, but that many of the processes marketers use are now too bureaucratic and ponderous. </p> <p>Some companies are simply hiving off their electronic division to keep the \"e-types\" from being too disruptive a force in the existing culture. This is, in effect, a kind of corporate denial. A better solution would be to embrace the need for change and become quicker to respond and less bureaucratic. Size is important in the e-world, but speed and agility are vital, too. The winners will be the companies that succeed in combining both. </p> <p>There are also implications for ways of working. In the words of one senior marketer, \"This is the death of precedent.\" Everyone in marketing will have to find quicker, more original ways of working, with more emphasis on creativity. This should, surely, be the perfect climate for agencies. </p> <p>While the marketing community is undergoing a revolution, agencies - which have traditionally seen themselves as the natural business partners of marketing clients - are turning into dinosaurs. They have not risen to the challenge of adapting to meet the rapidly changing needs of their customers. The web agencies fared even worse and were seen by one respondent as \"the dot.coms of the agency world: entrepreneurial, ambitious, but lacking substance\". </p> <p>However, the problem is not only one for agencies. As far as consumers are concerned, few companies are getting their electronic offering right. There is too much emphasis on design and too little on functionality in websites. </p> <p>One of the consumer respondents summed it up: \"Your website is your shop - whether or not you are planning to sell from it. Most people who visit are looking for information and help, and they need to be given it. Then they may stay to browse and even buy. If they don't like the feel of your place, they have the biggest shopping mall in the world on their desktop.\" </p> <p>However, this pales into insignificance against the biggest single conclusion from this research. We are witnessing the start of a seismic shift in the balance of power in marketing. We are feeling only the first distant rumbles, but as more people become e-enabled, the closer we will get to the epicentre of a major earthquake that has the potential to shake the very foundations on which marketing has been built. The marketing industry may soon look back with nostalgia at the good \"old\" world which was ruled by brands and built on inspiring confidence and reflecting consumer aspirations. </p> <p>Since the arrival of the e-world there has been much talk of building deeper relationships based on the previously undreamed of quality and quantity of data, providing a new depth of knowledge and the ability to anticipate consumer needs. Attractive as this model may seem to today's marketers, based on the consumer research, I believe it unlikely that this will be the future of marketing. </p> <p>While it is not news that the new, emergent e-consumer is becoming empowered, marketing has not yet fully understood the implications of meeting the needs of consumers who feel omnipotence rather than awe. In fact, this sense of omnipotence is not usually a response to marketing. It often comes on the back of a bigger need, such as the desire to become knowledgeable about a medical condition affecting a member of your family. It takes persistence and a degree of acquired skill to become really competent on the web. But this type of stimulus leads consumers to push through the pain barrier, and once they have done so there is no turning back. </p> <p>There is a glint in the eye and an almost belligerent attitude among consumers who have \"cracked\" the web. Marketers and brands really need to understand this phenomenon. Never before have consumers understood that they have the power over a medium and by extension over brands. What's fundamentally exciting is that consumers are controlling it, they are defining how it grows. They don't control the way the other media work, but they are controlling this and it's immensely exciting. </p> <p>People power is on the increase. Governments can't afford to ignore it and neither can brands, and this means that marketing needs to change beyond recognition.</p> <p>\u0095 Lindsey Roberts is founding partner of the FRESH ideas consultancy.</p>",

  "<p>She's the 11-plus failure who went to a top university. The BBC secretary who rose to take charge of all its drama. A woman who even rivals describe as \"very personable, very credible\". \"You will be hard pressed to find anyone with a bad word about her,\" says Andrew Davies, TV writer and adapter. Last Thursday, months of negotiation and five years of recrimination ended when Jane Tranter, 37, was named BBC drama commissioner - a new title for an old idea. </p> <p>She is the BBC's supreme drama leader, the creative champion at its most critical hour. \"The BBC can claim a piece of your heart,\" says Tranter, in a line that could fit one of her trademark costume dramas. What was her manifesto? \"What got me the job was the programmes I made. My manifesto is my work.\" In the past three years Tranter's serials department has produced the goods - Warriors, Wives and Daughters, David Copperfield, Care, and Other People's Children. </p> <p>Such is her standing that director general Greg Dyke preferred her modern take to the more traditional tastes of ITV's drama controller, Nick Elliott.\"She seems to enjoy herself. And she has the confidence to back her own judgments. She's actually like Elliott,\" says one observer. It is also said that the BBC simply could not afford to lose her to rival Channel 4. </p> <p>Tranter's mission is to rescue the BBC's reputation from inconsistency and downright bad programmes (Badger, Fish), while turning the huge spending boost on popular drama conjured up by Dyke into successful hour-long series for BBC1 at 9pm, supporting the move of the news. BBC1 has to double the amount of hour-long dramas it shows each week from two hours to four. \"We have to decide what makes a popular BBC drama,\" says Tranter, wearing black leather trousers, jumper and silver jewellery. \"To decide how to fill the hours with unique, distinctive dramas, that are BBC as opposed to what any other channel does. Our audience expectation has been dulled in the last decade.\" </p> <p>Harbour Lights and Sunburn, she believes, might have been done well by ITV. From now on, dramas as star vehicles are out. \"We have to do it fast, but not by panicking, without knee-jerk commissioning. If we think we need to stuff the autumn full of overly popular things we'll fail. We need to re-present ourselves to the audience with the very best ideas, based on the very best scripts.\" </p> <p>But Alan Yentob and Mark Thompson have also recruited two very substantial players, ex-Granada drama controller Simon Lewis and his deputy Sue Hogg, to make popular drama series for BBC1, fresh from creating the ITV series Grafters and Always &amp; Everyone. </p> <p>But here lies some confusion more reminiscent of the old-style BBC drama department. Much has been made over the past few months of Tranter's anxiety to clarify her position in relation to the Granada importees, before accepting the big job. Lewis believes the pair report direct to Thompson, while working with Tranter. Tranter, meanwhile, says, \"I will commission projects from Simon Lewis, [I will commission] everything from everyone, apart from the soaps.\" </p> <p>Examples of BBC1 dramas which fit her bill? Holby City, Casualty, EastEnders, David Copperfield, Wives and Daughters, Pure Wickedness, Down to Earth (the new Sunday night hit) and The Sins, a forthcoming series starring Pete Postlethwaite, a pure Tranter product. \"Look what the BBC has grown up with - Z Cars, Edge of Darkness, early Bergeracs, Boys from the Blackstuff.\" These, she says, are the traditions and influences to build on. \"I call it modern-retro, look at the best we have been and sharpen up what we're doing now.\" </p> <p>She is not a well-known face. Too busy working, she's never courted outside attention. \"I can't think of an argument I've had which is not about a programme. I think if you have arguments with people about getting the programmes made, and your only agenda is to get the best possible result on screen, then people understand why sometimes you're tough.\" Those who work with her say she defuses rows with cutting humour. </p> <p> Born in Oxford, Tranter is the daughter of two teachers. Both were strong Methodists from families where the industrious, pious tradition went back generations. When she failed the 11-plus, her parents paid fees for St Helen's &amp; St Margaret's School near Oxford, and then Kingswood School, Bath, the Methodist public school. She is poised rather than posh. </p> <p>Wanting to be an \"urban chick\", she headed for King's College, London and an English degree only to find it \"not very interesting - I was really cross about it.\" Dickens was the most modern author she studied. She also took \"hideously uncool plays to Edinburgh - like a Man for All Seasons.\" </p> <p>With a certificate from an Oxford secretarial course, she joined the BBC in 1985, camouflaged as a secretary at BBC Radio Drama. But at 24 she became an assistant TV floor manager for EastEnders and Bergerac, and was launched. \"It was old-fashioned - a way to learn everything about TV while disguising your intent. The whole time I was interested in scripts and how they came to be commissioned.\" </p> <p>One criticism is that her experience is too concentrated on the words, rather than the overall production - yet producers say she knows when to intervene if stars play up. Her second BBC break came in 1987 when she moved to be assistant script editor on the fourth series of Casualty, and the third break when David Thompson, now head of BBC Films, took her on as a script editor, working on Screen One and Two. Her reputation grew, leading Carlton to headhunt her for its new TV franchise, as a drama commissioner. \"I could not resist. I'd never get that opportunity again,\" she says. </p> <p>At Carlton she backed Timothy Spall in the comedy drama, Frank Stubbs Promotes, Bramwell - the then-rising writing star Lucy Gannon's surprise hit about a Victorian woman doctor - and the regional soap, London Bridge. Her return to the BBC in 1997 coincided with the disastrous split between broadcasting and production which encouraged channel controllers to turn to independent producers. </p> <p>As she joined, several of the BBC's most respected drama executives were quitting the chaos (\"shouting 'see you, suckers!'\" Tranter recalls) for the independent sector. \"I'd always thought I would return to the BBC. I couldn't bear it when I was in ITV and it was considered great sport to pull BBC dramas to pieces, even if frequently they deserved to be.\" When Michael Wearing left, she took over the BBC serials department, home of Our Friends in the North and Pride and Prejudice. </p> <p>\"An executive producer has a finger in many pies, you have an overview, provide a safety net, quality control; you get all of the blame, none of the credit. I love it. It is a job without boredom, you're in production 365 days a year, working at a cracking pace. I love the adrenalin of production going on all around you.\" </p> <p>Andrew Davies gives an insight into how Tranter works. When his Carlton drama Wilderness, about a woman who turns into a wolf, was bogged down, he recalls, \"she just went away, wrote a set of terrific notes and showed us a way through the difficulties. She is someone whose opinions are valued.\" </p> <p>Tranter says of the recent arid period: \"Part of the problem was that BBC drama had allowed itself to get overgrown and unventilated. It's always easy to look inward, into a bureaucracy. As soon as you do that, you're done for. You have got to understand the structures, but you have to look outside, to the audiences, concentrate on making programmes. I never changed my modus operandi. </p> <p>\"So [in serials] we put our heads down and made the programmes. Coming from ITV, the BBC was simple. I wrote out commissioning forms for development funds [for new dramas]. To have them green-lit I went across the road to [BBC1 controller] Peter Salmon, who'd joined at same time.

  "The Tawang valley in India's north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh is a remote place. A few tribal farmers live here. The occasional hunter can be seen slogging up its hillsides. Were it not for the fact the Buddhist mountain region occupies a pivotal place in India's relations with China, the valley would remain one of the country's most obscure and underdeveloped areas. <p>As it is, the roads leading deep into its interior are in excellent condition, even during the monsoon months. Their construction is a legacy of the war which China and India fought in the Tawang Valley in 1962. The war saw the Chinese invade the valley and press on as far as Tezpur in Assam, inflicting heavy casualties and humiliation on Indian troops. The Chinese eventually withdrew to what is now known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC).</p> <p>Nearly four decades later the area is still a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers. Confirmation of this came last Friday, when Arunachal Pradesh's chief minister, Mukut Mithi, alleged that Chinese troops had been making regular forays across the highly sensitive border. </p> <p>\"Maybe they have crossed the border without knowing where the LAC stands - but in any case this has to be stopped,\" he said.</p> <p>Over the weekend Mr Mithi escorted a party of journalists up to the Sino-Indian border to prove his point. He showed them what he said was a new Chinese-built mule trail in the Dibang valley district, and claimed that \"repeated incursions\" were taking place. \"Normally they come in the guise of graziers or hunters by encroaching on the LAC. Sometimes they claim that the land belongs to them,\" he said.</p> <p>Whether the incursions are genuine or imaginary, they speak volumes about the continuing mutual mistrust which exists between New Delhi and Beijing. India still lays claim to 40,000 sq kms (16,000 sq miles) of territory occupied by China in Kashmir, while China lays claim to a wide swathe of territory in Arunachal Pradesh, which shares a 650-mile border with China.</p> <p>Unlike the disputed border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir, where rival troops shell each other every day, the Sino-Indian frontier does not ring with gunfire. Postal workers from both countries even exchange letters for villagers who live next to the LAC. China and India recently set up a working party to clarify the issue. But the tension continues: in 1986 the Red army allegedly constructed a helipad at the frontier, only for it to be demolished by Indian troops.</p> <p>On the diplomatic front, relations between Indian and China remain outwardly cordial. India's president paid a successful visit to Beijing earlier this year. China's foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, came to India in July. </p> <p>But there exists plenty of suspicion too, most of it concerning the nuclear issue. India continues to accuse China of helping its archrival Pakistan to acquire advanced nuclear missile technology. US intelligence and military sources confirm that Pakistan's nuclear programme is more advanced than India's because of assistance from China and North Korea.</p> <p>In 1998 India and Pakistan carried out tit-for-tat nuclear tests. India's defence minister, George Fernandes, defended the action on the grounds that India faced a nuclear threat from China. Last month he announced that India's latest inter-continental missile, Agni III, would be ready for testing \"sooner than expected\". The missile has a range of 2,500kms - enough to hit targets in central China. In turn, the Chinese have complained of Indian navy patrols in the South China sea.</p> <p>Though India's relations with Pakistan dominate the attention of foreign policy analysts in the US and Europe, the country's relationship with China is in many ways more intriguing. </p> <p>And more complex. The two most challenging postings for Indian diplomats abroad are widely held to be Beijing and Islamabad. \"In the short term the problem is Pakistan,\" one diplomat said. \"But in the long term it is the Chinese we need to worry about.\"</p> <p><b>Email:</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:luke.harding@theguardian.com\"> luke.harding@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/kashmir/0,2759,184266,00.html\">India and Pakistan</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/pakistan/0,2759,180809,00.html\">Pakistan</a></p> <p> <b>Other articles:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=luke+harding&amp;Query=luke+harding&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=Vdkpublicationdate+desc&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Luke Harding</a></p> <p><b>Useful links:</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.timesofindia.com/\" target=\"_new\">Times of India</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.paktoday.com/\" target=\"_new\">Pakistan Today</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.indiamonitor.com/\" target=\"_new\">India Monitor</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/in.html\" target=\"_new\">CIA world factbook: India</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/pk.html\" target=\"_new\">CIA world factbook: Pakistan</a><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mnet.fr/aiindex/\" target=\"_new\">South Asia citizens' network</a></p>",
  "With apologies to the residents of Uckfield, Lamberhurst, Lewes and a host of other villages and towns across southern England who are surveying the mud-silted wreckage of their homes and businesses this morning, the floods couldn't have come at a better time. Indeed, a conspiracy theorist might concoct a notion that a bunch of eco-terrorists had sabotaged sluice gates to ensure the scenes we've had of flooded fields and high streets turned to churning rivers \u00e0 la Mozambique. The timing is excellent. We are only a month away from the Hague convention on climate change when the promises of Kyoto are supposed to be nailed down, and there is a real danger that the convention will go belly-up, in large part owing to US truculence. <p>Climate change induces a strange apathy. Everyone knows about it, few people do anything about it. If an environmentalist group launches a campaign to save a cuddly animal, it will get plenty of support, but only the really dedicated will write letters to their MP demanding a 20% cut in carbon emissions. An air of unreality has settled over the whole subject. Kyoto asked for cuts of 5% below 1990 levels, which the scientists assert is hopelessly inadequate. They say we need cuts of 60-80%. </p> <p>Yet even Kyoto may prove impossible. A decade after it was universally accepted that climate change was caused by carbon emissions, they are still rising. Not even scare stories seem to have had much effect. To cap it all, the fuel tax protest a month ago seemed the coup de grace, pre-empting the whole debate in the Hague. It could have been a textbook PR exercise on the part of the oil companies to demonstrate the power and stubbornness of the electorate: don't mess with our petrol. </p> <p>Just when it seemed that all was lost, rivers we had nearly forgotten about with richly redolent names such as the Beult, Uck, Ouse and Tiesse spring their wondrous revenge on our indifference. The rivers we had thought we had safely corralled proved our hubris. Seventeen severe flood warnings, 47 flood warnings, 97 flood watches: virtually the entire country was threatened by the worst floods in 40 years. The sense of outrage and anger from those affected suggested that we had forgotten that rivers flood. They always have done from time to time; what has changed is that they are now flooding frequently. We have to learn again the folk knowledge that was lost for a couple of generations about how rivers behave: where they flood, how they can suddenly rise and the destructive force of a river in spate. It was not for nothing that our ancestors worshipped water spirits; they knew their power, for creation and destruction. </p> <p>We lost this knowledge because we believed that such chances of nature could be ironed out by a combination of technology and government raising and applying the necessary revenue. Sue Tapsell, a fellow at Middlesex's Flood Hazard Research Centre, has done research on the impact of floods in County Durham and the Thames Valley; the common theme is the impulse to blame - it is someone's fault. What quickly follows is the angry comment of a man quoted last week who has been flooded three times this year: \"Something has got to be done.\" He is absolutely right. It has, but - here's the catch - it won't stop the floods. Even if we magically managed to cut our carbon emissions tomorrow, we will be reaping the results of the carbon we have already put into the atmosphere for generations to come. The consequences of all this for the faith and trust we have in government are legion - the environment does not pay dividends within an election cycle. </p> <p>The million-dollar question is how you close the gap between the angry \"something must be done\" and the dramatic shift in lifestyle and political priorities (investment in renewable energy before the NHS) that is necessary. Platform, a London-based group of activists and artists, advocates a process of reconnecting individuals and communities with their environment, which in cities is often buried under their feet. They have been running a campaign on London's rivers - Still Waters - many of which are no more than bricked over drains. On the river Wandle, a micro-hydroturbine powers some of the local primary school lights, and a bell is triggered on high tide. </p> <p> The task is herculean. Tapsell has done research with London schoolchildren on their attitudes to the countryside. Some had never been there; some didn't know what a river was; some said they'd prefer it if it was tidier and there were benches; some said the countryside scared them, they might be snatched by strangers or catch a disease. Country Life's survey of children's attitudes to the countryside last week revealed similar themes. </p> <p>One poignant comment indicated how regimented and confined is children's interaction with nature: \"You cannot sit on grass in case there are dog faeces.\" When Tapsell took a party of children to a river, they revelled in being allowed to get wet and muddy. Once it was in that intimate, intensely sensual experience of nature (on wasteland or in the countryside proper), that most children experienced their first taste of freedom. The exhilaration of building a den or climbing a tree is about escaping adult control. Our interaction with materials used to start with the mud and the puddles. Now it's in the hygienic playschool's water play. Somewhere along the line, we've lost the link between nature and freedom and drilled a fear of open spaces into children. They're relegated to the confines of the playground under a watchful eye, while the countryside is as real as video tape as it flashes past the car window. </p> <p>The twin principles which govern children's attitudes (and probably many of their parents) to the countryside are fear and sentimentalisation. Human life has never lasted so long, and never have so few lives been lost to accidents and serious illness in Britain, and yet we are more preoccupied than ever about preserving life and reducing risk. Partly in response to that sense of danger, we have constructed a children's entertainment industry predicated on airbrushing out the unpredictable brutality of nature: Bambi and Percy the Park-keeper. What help is the Jungle Book to the generation who will have to cope with more of the consequences of environmental degradation than ever before? </p> <p>The alternative, as environmental scientist James Lovelock has argued, is that we need a few really nasty shocks. If London, Hamburg or Washington DC were flooded, with a serious loss of life, we might finally start making connections between climate change and our unsustainable lifestyle. The problem about this argument is that by the time London floods, most of Bangladesh and the Nile delta will be long underwater. Rather, the best chance Britain has is a course of environmental ECT: lots of small, nasty shocks where it really hurts. So roll on the Uck, Beult and Tiesse, they've got a lot to teach us. The more floods, the merrier. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com\">madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The city of Cardiff is effortlessly dominated by the new rugby stadium, the one they decided to build instead of an opera house by Zaha Hadid. Built like a cross between a ship, a space station and a branch of Sainsbury's, it is a permanent reminder that in this city sport and populism count for more than culture. </p> <p>With hindsight, the Centre for Visual Art was never going to make it here. The only major contemporary art space in Wales opened to a great fanfare in the Hayes shopping centre last summer. It was a converted Victorian library, but unlike the original institution it charged admission, and had a touchy-feely introduction to contemporary art for children on the top floor. It wanted to be the Millennium Dome and Tate Modern simultaneously, but had no chance of being either because its funding bodies - the Arts Council of Wales and the city council provided the bulk of the \u00a39m cost - expected the centre to make up a serious financial shortfall from admissions in its first year. The financial crisis at the end of 12 months was not merely predictable. It is almost as if it were planned in advance. The CVA is to close in its present form on November 5. </p> <p>Cardiff's political establishment went about the business of establishing the Centre so half-heartedly that it's hard to believe they wanted a modern art gallery at all. Instead of nurturing an audience for new art, the CVA acted as a proof to cultural conservatives that Welsh people don't want this modern art rubbish, see. </p> <p>Instead, Cardiff has a world-class rugby stadium. It also has the \u00a32bn Cardiff Bay Development - eventually to include an new cultural hub, the much-delayed Wales Millennium Centre - where the despised docklands have been turned into a genteel setting for businesses and fish restaurants. The aesthetics of the new Cardiff Bay, as with other waterfront reclamations from Sunderland to Liverpool to New York's Pier 17, are cosily retrograde. This kind of reclamation can create a pleasant setting for eating an ice cream. It cannot make a city feel like a city. </p> <p>Cities are cultural entities. The texture of social and economic life in them is defined by their cultural energy or lack of it, and cities all over the world - Glasgow, Barcelona, Seattle - have demonstrated that by changing the way their cultural life is perceived you can change everything about them. The problem is that culture is not something that can be neatly delivered from above. It cannot - as the Welsh critic Raymond Williams argued, because it is complex and living. When city authorities - and in the case of Cardiff, national governments - try to regenerate a city by mixing up architectural, artistic and leisure projects, the results can be catastrophic. Sheffield ends up with a National Centre for Popular Music (aka the Unpopular Centre for National Music) whose shiny Nigel Coates design cannot conceal the poverty of its displays; Newcastle gets a vast, pointless life-science centre; Greenwich gets the Dome. </p> <p>What these follies have in common is a patronising conception of popular culture. The question, as city after city tries to turn itself into a hip, swinging cultural metropolis, is what kind of culture do you want and why? To a city like Cardiff, the answer appears to be popular, mainstream culture. So opera was out, and contemporary art is out. Rugby is in. But what Cardiff's Taffia has done is to impose a boring cultural stereotype on the city, and on Wales, and then to build monuments to this stereotype. As a strategy for urban cultural regeneration, this is a disaster. Cardiff feels small - it is, with a population of 320,000 - and parochial. It has the commercial and leisure venues you see all over Britain. But this does not add up to any sense of metropolitan energy. </p> <p>Architecture in Wales means, for many people, medieval castles perched on rocky crags over slate-built towns. The castles built by the English in the 14th century are architectural masterpieces - dense, raw structures that still speak of power. The problem for Wales is that there is no metropolitan tradition to compare with these rustic ruins. The urbanisation of south Wales only happened in the 19th century and a country that had always had a tiny population scattered across small towns and hamlets never really got used to the idea of the big city. Swansea, with its mid-20th-century cultural scene, was perhaps the closest to a Glasgow or Dublin - but Dylan Thomas spent his final days in faraway New York. </p> <p>The Welsh have built towns that seem makeshift and frightened compared to the looming mountains. The interior world of the home has been valued more than public space; the national imagination is rooted in the village. For all these reasons, Cardiff's culture has shied away from the metropolitan and expressed itself until recently in a flight to the suburbs. That's why \"cultural regeneration\" has become necessary, with the Cardiff Bay scheme - including the construction of a \u00a3200m barrage to control tidal levels and the opening up of waterfront spaces for development - and the Millennium Stadium attempting to lure money into the city centre. </p> <p>In too many cities in Britain the bright, shiny dream of \"cultural regeneration\" has been pursued without the courage to believe in culture at all. What is most wrong is the assumption that a cultural project in a city has to fit in with what is already there. Sheffield thought it was a pop city (The Human League! Jarvis!); Cardiff thinks it is Rugby Central. But where cities have exploded into cultural life it has been a surprise. Glasgow's 1980s literary scene and cur rent art scene had nothing in common with the way the city had always been imagined. </p> <p>Good art is serious and difficult. It does not confirm what you already know. This is why so many of the new cultural spaces and projects in cities across Britain just turn into samey exercises of less interest than the opening of a new multiplex. At least multiplexes, music and book megastores give people access to contemporary culture. The lessons of success and failure in the cultural renewal of Britain's cities can be stated simply. Tate Modern or Millennium Dome? </p> <p>Across the country, enterprises that respect their public succeed. Glasgow succeeds, public art commissions such as Alison Wilding's Ambit in Sunderland succeed, Norman Foster's glasshouse in the Welsh countryside succeeds. Intelligent avant-garde culture excites people. In a city it creates drama and possibility - the essence of the metropolitan. By contrast, local authorities who have assumed that everyone is an idiot have ended up with embarrassing follies. </p> <p>If Cardiff wants to be a cultural mecca why not create something really wild? A John Cale Gallery of the 1960s Fluxus avant-garde, a Frank Lloyd Wright museum designed by Frank Gehry, a Gorky's Zygotic Mynci centre for bilingual culture - with a cafe called Bwyd Time. But then what's the point if the city can't even keep a modern art centre open for more than 12 months. </p> <p>\u0095 The British Art Show 5 is at the Centre for Visual Art, Cardiff (029-2038 8922), till November 5.</p>",
  "<p>The Labour peer Lord Hollick is expected today to receive a bid of at least \u00a3100m for the Express newspaper titles from the Hinduja Group. </p> <p>The imminent bid by the group, run by brothers Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja, will turn the tussle for control of the Labour-sympathising Daily Express, Sunday Express and Daily Star stable into at least a three-horse race. </p> <p>United News &amp; Media, which owns the newspapers, rejected an approach last week by two other rich brothers, the twins David and Frederick Barclay, as too low at \u00a375m. </p> <p>It is understood that informal talks have also been held between Lord Hollick and David Montgomery, former chief executive of the Mirror Group. </p> <p>Rumours about other potential bidders, including Mohamed Al Fayed, the owner of Harrods, were also circulating last night. </p> <p>Confirmation of the imminent bid by the Hinduja Group, which has a wide range of businesses from banking to oil and media, prompted one source to comment last night: \"There does appear to be a horse race emerging.\" </p> <p>Lord Hollick is understood to want more than \u00a3150m for the Express group. Its main title sells approximately 1m copies a day, a little more than the Sunday title. </p> <p>Speculation about the future of the Express group intensified after its parent, United News &amp; Media, was forced to back down from its television ambitions after regulatory intervention. As a result, the group sold its TV franchises to Granada, and while Lord Hollick has denied that the Express is up for sale, major shareholders in United believe the titles are on the market. </p> <p>Lord Hollick is said to have told the Barclay brothers that he wanted double the \u00a375m offered, but it is understood that he intends to hold out for an even higher price for the papers, which he has turned from Tory supporters to enthusiasts for New Labour. </p> <p>The latest bid for the Express comes from two brothers who rank eighth in the Sunday Times rich list, and who also have close connections to the government. </p> <p>The Hinduja brothers, who are based in London, said that their bid would aim to counter any claims of political bias by setting up a board of trustees that would guarantee the editorial independence of the newspapers. They are British citizens and have two other brothers, one Swiss and one Indian. </p> <p>They made their first pitch for the Express to United News &amp; Media's financial advisers, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, on Friday afternoon. They are expected to table it formally as soon as today. </p> <p>They said last night that the offer would be made by Amas UK, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hinduja Group. </p> <p>\"The group believes that with the appropriate structuring, good management, a strong editorial team and injection of cash, Express Newspapers can once again become an excellent business investment as part of the group's media communications business,\" the Hinduja Group said. </p> <p>The group pledged to encourage a \"genuine campaigning spirit on issues that matter to the British people and that improve the quality of life for everyone\". </p> <p>They will make their bid just before they discover whether they are to be indicted on bribery charges, with one of their other brothers, in India.</p>",
  "<p>There are more exclusive destinations than Le Saint Geran in Mauritius or Little Dix Bay in the British Virgin Islands. No star name and billion-dollar bank account will get you a ticket to Maja Vallis or Tritonis Lacus for the spring of 2003. There is, however, one man who is going. A man convinced that, when the early sun begins to warm the rusty flood channels of Chryse and the dusty expanse of the Elysium plains, he and his team will be exploring them. His name is Colin Pillinger, and he works in Milton Keynes. </p> <p>This spring is not on Earth, and much as he would love to be, Pillinger is not going to be there in person. What he is attempting to do is almost as extraordinary: pull together a diffuse group of scientists and engineers, on a wee budget and a tight timescale, to build the first British spacecraft to land on another planet. That, and answer a question which has bothered us for a few hundred years: is there life on Mars? </p> <p>Pillinger, professor of planetary sciences at the Open University, believes the Mars lander he is building, Beagle 2, will be able to sniff out the evidence of life, if there is any to be found. But Beagle, on board the European Space Agency mission Mars Express, will not be alone. The vessel of a richer, older space power, Nasa, will be cruising through space hard on the heels of Mars Express, with its own, more expensive and elaborate set of landers - the Athena project - on board. A race has begun. </p> <p>The public face of space science tends to be all smiles and friendship between nations. But Pillinger has been making some distinctly undiplomatic remarks in public about the virtues of his budget Beagle against the $400m (\u00a3272m) Athena, which will consist of two labs mounted on wheels, able to roam across the Martian surface. (Accounts of the cost of Beagle range from a 10th of this to a third, if you include the whole Mars Express mission.) </p> <p>Pillinger's most scathing remarks came at the British Association science festival last month, when he said: \"Athena has what I believe to be an inferior package of scientific instruments to search for life.\" It was a bold attack, and a hostage to fortune. \"It was an entirely valid criticism delivered in the way I delivered it, when I was supposed to be saying what was good about British science,\" he says now. \"I wouldn't want to labour the point.\" But he won't withdraw it, either. He is disappointed by his rival's tactics, which he says will only yield measurements indirectly showing the existence of water, a prerequisite for life. Beagle will directly sample the air, rocks and soil for carbon compounds which are the products and components of life. </p> <p>\"It's very difficult to see how [Athena] is going to further our study of Mars,\" Pillinger says. \"They're going to show they have the technical ability to move around the planet but it isn't going to look for life.\" </p> <p>Pillinger's opposite number on the other side of the Atlantic, Steven Squyres of Cornell University, is too courteous to admit to anything so crude as rivalry. But it would lead to some heavy angst at Nasa, with 35 years of missions to Mars to its credit, if a small country with a minimal track record in space managed to land a probe on the planet first time, and then announced to the world it had solved the mystery of whether it hosted life. </p> <p>Nasa's history of successful Mars missions has been interspersed with so many disasters that as far back as 1969 a Nasa scientist wondered if there wasn't a \"galactic ghoul\" standing sentinel over our neighbour in space. Last year was so calamitous the agency had to rethink its whole programme: a Mars climate surveyor was lost because the engineers who built it mixed up metric and imperial measurements, and two months later a polar lander vanished without trace after starting its descent to the surface. </p> <p>Which is why, of course, Squyres - who was involved in both missions - thinks Nasa should be taking it slow, careful and long. And why, perhaps, Pillinger might have bitten off a teeny bit more than he can chew. </p> <p>\"The nice thing about our programme is it really is a programme. It's not just one mission,\" Squyres says pointedly. \"We did Mars Pathfinder (a successful mission) for a very low cost. Then we went back and did two missions for less than the cost of Pathfinder, and they both failed. The lesson we drew from that is that if you push too hard in terms of faster, better, cheaper, you have failed missions.\" </p> <p>Squyres' point is that Nasa's rovers are scouts for other US missions to come, which will be more focused on the search for life. \"We're not carrying biological instrumentation,\" he admits. \"Our mission has a different focus.\" </p> <p>Can Pillinger pull it off? \"The Europeans aren't overreaching themselves by identifying something which is a key objective and going for it,\" says Andr\u00e9 Balogh, professor of space physics at Imperial College in London. \"The Europeans can make a difference if - and it is a big if - Mars Express works. It remains a relatively high-risk project.\" </p> <p>Squyres and Pillinger have never met. The American is younger - 44 to Pillinger's 57. Squyres grew up in a science family in Winona, New Jersey; his father had a chemistry doctorate from MIT. Pillinger, from Kingswood on the outskirts of Bristol, declines to talk about his childhood. But there is a symmetry. Both men went into science - Squyres into geology, Pillinger chemistry - with no clear idea of where they were going, only to be touched by the lure of space early on. </p> <p>With Squyres, it was being taught as a student in the 1970s by a scientist who had worked on the Viking Mars landers. \"As I got deeper into geology, I concluded there wasn't that much more real exploring to be done on Earth,\" he says. \"I was captivated by the idea of being able to explore other worlds.\" </p> <p>Just out of his postgraduate training, Pillinger was taken on by Bristol University in 1969 to analyse fragments of lunar rock from the Apollo missions. It was the start of a career which saw him become one of the world's leading experts on moon rocks and Martian meteorites, chips of Mars which were sent flying into space after an asteroid collided with that planet and which ended up bumping into Earth. </p> <p>\"It was good to go out at night and look at the moon and be able to say: 'I work on that,' \" he says. </p> <p>While Squyres was taken up rapidly into Nasa's sprawling space science establishment, Pillinger remained confined to earthly labs for decades. When in 1997 ESA began canvassing missions for Mars Express, he seized his chance. </p> <p>Brushing aside the doubts of the European space bureaucracy about whether money could be found for a lander, he convinced them he would raise the funds himself. So Beagle 2 was born, funded by British universities and businesses, a sceptical government and a band of as yet unrevealed sponsors being corralled by Saatchi and Saatchi. </p> <p>If all goes according to plan, around Christmas 2003, Beagle will separate from the Mars Express orbiter, descend to the planet by parachute and bounce to a halt in a coccoon of gas bags. A clamshell shield will unfold, exposing Beagle's scientific instruments, and the lander will beam back to Earth a Blur track specially composed for the event. Beagle's cameras will be calibrated by filming an image of coloured spots provided by Damien Hirst. If nothing else, Britscience is putting the first and probably last Britpop and Britart on Mars. </p> <p>A few days later, the first Athena lander will drop onto another part of the planet. Given past experience, the odds are poor that Beagle and Athena will both perform flawlessly. It would be an extraordinary coup for Pillinger if a working British Beagle was merrily scratching and sniffing around in the Martian dirt when Nasa arrived. It would be a profound personal blow if something went wrong. </p> <p>\"Beagle 2 is very much Colin Pillinger's baby, and he has very much put himself on the line,\" says Balogh. \"He's got an extremely distinguished background in analysing meteorites in the laboratory. This is a big departure for him. </p> <p>\"He's in a fairly exposed position. But I think that without people like him, science doesn't necessarily advance at anything but a pedestrian level.\" </p> <p>Pillinger is aware of the risks. \"It's ever so easy to land on Mars on paper,\" he says. \"My answer is we've recruited what we think are the best possible players in Europe. We believe we have a strong, substantial team.\" </p> <p>Speculation about whether life exists on Mars has been going on since the 17th century. No matter how many disappointments there have been - confirmation by the Mariner probes in the 1960s that Mars was a frigid desert with a thin atmosphere, the lack of evidence for life found by the Viking landers in the 1970s - there is an overwhelming desire on the part of humankind to believe we are not alone in the solar system. </p> <p>The announcement in 1996 that researchers had found fossilised life in one of the Martian meteorites which fell to Earth received much greater attention than the subsequent chorus of scientific criticism saying the \"fossils\" were, in fact, natural geological features. </p> <p>There is always a suspicion that space scientists cynically play up the chances of finding life on Mars or the Jovian moons to drum up public support, and hence funding, for their programmes - even when they don't, in their hearts, have any hope that life is there. </p> <p>It seems to be another thing that Squyres and Pillinger have in common that they aren't like that. They both insist they will wait for the data to come in. But it is clear that they wouldn't be so interested in Mars if they were sure, personally, that the rocks were dead. </p> <p>\"One of the things that makes Mars a special place is the fact that it is so Earthlike, and the possibility that life must have arisen there,\" says said Squyres. \"It's very hard to prove the negative, that there is no life.\" </p> <p>Pillinger thinks the jury is still out on what the meteorites show. He is convinced that the \"fossils\" show evidence of water flow and carbon compounds, the building blocks of life. Beagle has to prove that the carbon compounds are native to Mars, rather than being the results of contamination of the meteorites, and to see what else it can find - like methane in the Martian atmosphere, which would be as clear an indicator of life as a sign in Maja Vallis saying: \"Mars Welcomes Careful Landers.\" </p> <p>If Squyres sees himself as an explorer, Pillinger is more of a sleuth. \"At the beginning analysing extraterrestrial rocks turned out to be the job I was offered, but there were times when I could have said I'd like to do forensic science.

  "Two men who hijacked a Saudi Arabia Airlines jet carrying 90 passengers, including 40 Britons, disclosed yesterday that they wanted to protest against Saudi human rights abuses. <p>The two, who were under arrest in Iraq last night, described themselves as ordinary people rather than international terrorists. The incident was not related to the Palestinian-Israeli clashes. </p> <p>The two hijackers surrendered in the early hours of yesterday morning at Saddam international airport in Baghdad after hours of negotiations with Iraqi officials. They had threatened to blow up the plane with TNT explosives. </p> <p>The plane, which had 17 crew on board, was hijacked over the Mediterranean on Saturday night en route from Jeddah to London. The hijackers forced the pilot to change course, flying over Syria and on to Baghdad. </p> <p>The freed passengers, who include 15 Saudis, 15 Pakistanis and various other nationalities, spent Saturday night at a hotel in Baghdad. Last night they left the hotel to fly to Riyadh in Saudia Arabia where they were planning to spend another night. They are expected to continue to London today. </p> <p>The passengers had not realised that they had been hijacked until the plane landed in Baghdad. </p> <p>One passenger, Jacky Doyle, a mother of two who works for the British Museum, said: \"I was not aware of the hijacking until I realised that we were at another airport, not Heathrow.\" </p> <p>One of the hijackers told reporters yesterday at the airport in Baghdad: \"We are just ordinary people and we are calling for the rights of the Saudi people, such as decent education, decent health and other services.\" </p> <p>They called for the abolition of the Saudi monarchy, which presides over a government with one of the worst human rights records in the world. </p> <p>A recent report by the human rights group Amnesty International condemned the regime for a series of abuses, in particular public executions. One of those on board the hijacked plane was a Saudi prince. </p> <p>The hijackers, who gave a press conference at the end of the seven-hour ordeal, said that they had chosen to force the aircraft to fly to Iraq because \"the Iraqi people are under embargo and because we trust the Iraqis and they will not betray us\". </p> <p>Both looked relaxed and one of them covered his face with a handkerchief. They refused to give their names. </p> <p>But the United Arab Emirates satellite television channel in Abu Dhabi identified the two men as Ayeish Ali al-Khalidi and Faisel Naji al-Bluey, both from Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>The hijackers twice threatened to destroy the Boeing jet, once in the air and again on the tarmac of the airport in Baghdad. </p> <p>\"We carried out the operation because we believe in the principles of justice and equality,\" said one. The other added that the Saudi people were opposed to the presence of American troops in their country. </p> <p>Both hijackers said they had not asked for political asylum and did not intend to stay in Iraq. Although Saudi Arabia has asked for their return, the Iraqi government hinted that it was unlikely to comply, given that there are no diplomatic ties between the two countries. </p> <p>Passengers told how the hijackers had shown the captain a cache of three bombs and a gun. </p> <p>Waqas Hussein, 21, a passenger from Pakistan going to study in the UK, said there had been little or no security at Jeddah airport when they began their journey. \"There wasn't any checking of our luggage or ourselves,\" he said. </p> <p>He added: \"People were scared but nobody got rowdy. I saw some tense faces. After four hours sitting in the plane the captain announced that they had successfully negotiated with the hijackers. </p> <p>\"Everybody on board clapped as the hijackers left.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the first episode of the third series of The Royle Family (tonight, 9.30pm, BBC1) was recorded, its opening dialogue must have seemed merely a little jokey nip at the feeding hand. Watching BBC1, Jim Royle complains that \"it's all shite\" and the family are \"going to have to get Sky\". </p> <p>Now Caroline Aherne's comedy forms, along with the final series of One Foot in the Grave (tonight, 9pm, BBC1), an emergency scheduling bridgehead before the first BBC News (tonight, 10pm, BBC1) to be transmitted in the old ITN News At Ten slot. In short, Jim Royle is charged with preventing the BBC1 audience from deciding it's all shite and buying Sky. </p> <p>The only television comedy in which the dialogue is almost wholly about TV has found its perfect moment. A further irony is that Victor Meldrew in One Foot in the Grave is precisely the kind of middle-class grump who would regard a sudden switch in the timing of the news as a perversion of the natural order and phone the BBC to moan. </p> <p>But, for the first six weeks of the new News, Royle and Meldrew should be able to divert the shite-watchers and switchboard-jammers, because these are among television's most brilliant and original comedies. And, in each case, a format now famous has been invigorated by a new plot-point. In One Foot in the Grave it's an impending death: Victor dies in the final episode. In The Royle Family, it's a recent birth. </p> <p>The arrival of Denise and Dave's first child David Keanu perfectly illustrates the mixture of vulgarity and subtlety in Caroline Aherne and Craig Cash's writing. Jim Royle's terror of breast-feeding - flinching at a reference to \"leaking in Top Shop\" - might have been predicted, but Denise's post-natal depression and maternal indifference - leaving all nappy-changes and night-waking to her husband - are an unusually dark strain in domestic sitcom. The alarmed glances of the parents - a solidarity of horror at their daughter's state - are beautifully played by Sue Johnston and Ricky Tomlinson. </p> <p>But the show's status as an anthology of popular culture is extended by the kitchen scene in which teenager Anthony Royle and his friend Darren laboriously swap Ali G impersonations. It's typical of the sharpness of observation that one of the boys is a terrible mimic and that both have the latest Beckham shave-cuts. </p> <p>As co-writer, star and now director of this episode, Caroline Aherne is now approaching a Woody Allen or Warren Beatty level of multi-skilling. The only question over the series' classic status is whether its frequent sell-by references - Anne Robinson, Posh and Becks, Ali G - will prevent it from claiming new generations of viewers in the way that Dad's Army and Fawlty Towers have. </p> <p>One Foot in the Grave reminds us that writer David Renwick understands (as with his other hit, Jonathan Creek) that TV is a visual medium. This may seem a truism but TV comedy can be - and frequently is - carried by dialogue. A writer with brilliant ears and lazy eyes can still become rich. Characteristically, however, Renwick's opening episode is built around visual images: a giant television set accidentally bought, two works of modern art, the apparent discovery of human remains in Meldrew's garden. </p> <p>What's notable about both these shows - and what explains their unusual double success in attracting enthusiastic reviews and high ratings - is that they alternate broad and narrow comedy, appealing simultaneously to two audiences. </p> <p>The tabloids enjoy Meldrew for his Alf Garnett-like rants and DIY disasters; the broadsheets acknowledge the nods to Samuel Beckett, which writer David Renwick has admitted are deliberate. There's even an episode in which Victor is buried up to his neck in earth like Winnie in Happy Days - an ironic Beckettian phrase which would be a perfect sub-title for One Foot in the Grave. </p> <p>David Renwick has joked that he kept the literary inspiration for the show's tone quiet because you couldn't tell the Controller of BBC1 you were writing a Beckettian sitcom. But you wonder if he's the only one keeping this secret. The Royle Family also does to the sitcom what the Irish cricketer-dramatist did to the conventions of the boulevard stage comedy, again working through a cunning double structure. </p> <p>Consisting almost entirely of references to very recent popular culture, The Royle Family seems on the surface a wholly mainstream show, but its lack of incident and the risk the dialogue takes with banality and repetition often render it surreal. </p> <p>Indigence prevented Beckett's tramps from having television, but there is something very familiar in the Royle Family's attempt to avert tedium and fear through circular dialogue which frequently turns to discussion of sex and bodily functions. Beached on their sofa in front of their god of a box, they patiently but hopelessly wait for a revelation which will never come - Waiting For Dando, perhaps. </p> <p>Who would have thought that a primary influence on sitcom at the turn of the 21st century would be Samuel Beckett? But, with many television programmes these days struggling to attract one audience, the BBC is lucky to be beginning its scheduling endgame on BBC1 with a pair of shows which can bring in two. </p> <p><strong>Class act</strong></p> <p>Those who dislike The Royle Family are usually uneasy about its attitude to the working-class; the allegation Mike Leigh has also faced. It's a fair concern - Caroline Aherne's stance seems to me at best cheer-sneer - and reminds us just how much of British TV has social standing as its subject even in an allegedly egalitarian era. </p> <p>The legal drama North Square (Wednesday, 9pm, Channel 4) is advertised as and looks like a British version of LA Law and Ally McBeal, but the drama of the opening episode depends, to a perhaps surprising degree, on the clash of background and accent. </p> <p>The temptation is obvious because the relationship between barristers and their clerks still generally obeys the stereotype of the toff-thug double-act. North Square encourages this by focusing on chief clerk Peter (Phil Davis), a chain-smoking cockney who rebukes a Blairite new barrister for inviting his clerk to first-name him rather than \"sir\" him. In another scene, a toffish lawyer is thumped by a Scottish one for a racist remark. </p> <p>One of the strengths of American legal series has been the way they explained legal foible and detail, but, on the early evidence, North Square seems over-concerned with the Fair Employment Act as a source of dramatic tension. It's true that easy assumptions are undermined - the clerk proves more cultured than the barristers - but even these moments arise from consideration of class. </p> <p>Peter Moffat's writing and Tim Fywell's direction are smarter and glossier respectively than Kavanagh QC, but, for a series billed as breaking the laws of the British legal series, it's worrying that the opening insight - juries coming back into court never make eye-contact with someone they've convicted - has previously been made by both Rumpole and Kavanagh. This could still be a classy number if only it had less class.</p>",
  "After a Tory junior home affairs spokesman denounced Cherie Booth as \"an unaccountable cross between First Lady and Lady Macbeth,\" Rabinder Singh must have been surprised to find himself caught in the crossfire. He was the colleague who co-wrote the controversial Daily Telegraph article last August on the human rights act which revealed, so the Tories claimed, that the prime minister's wife had her own political agenda. <p>Maybe it was linking the act to the \"third way\" which sent their blood pressure soaring. Booth was trumpeting legislation passed by her husband's government which would put millions into the coffers of her new human rights chambers, Matrix, said the charge sheet. It's not something Singh wants to talk about, and his reticence leaves the impression that it was a bruising episode. Although it was Booth who was asked to write the article, she brought him in on the task. A co-founder of Matrix, he has written extensively on human rights law, and the article reads more like his thoughts than hers. </p> <p>Today the Foreign Office will announce Singh's appointment as the independent monitor overseeing the fairness of the entry clearance system through which people from other countries are granted or refused permission for short visits to the UK. The inevitable cries of cronyism will go up and with some of Labour's appointments, such cavils have been justified. Not with this one. For one thing, the 36-year-old barrister will be taking a cut in earnings to shoulder the part-time job. It will occupy him for eight weeks a year just when the new human rights act will put him most in demand for high-profile and well-paid court cases. The \u00a3350 a day it pays is no more than half the rate he commands for his legal services, other barristers estimate. And there is no doubt that he got the post on merit. </p> <p>Chambers Guide to the Legal Profession rates Singh among the top three juniors (non-Queen's Counsel ) for public and administrative law. \"He is one of the brightest barristers of his generation,\" says the foreign office minister Keith Vaz, who chose him from a shortlist to go forward for approval by the home secretary, Jack Straw, and by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who makes the appointment. </p> <p>The post was created seven years ago when appeals against entry clearance refusals were abolished. Since then, appeals have been restored for those who wish to visit relatives in Britain. That leaves those coming for non-family reasons without a right to appeal. The independent monitor oversees the decision-making process in those cases but plays no role in individual cases. He makes random checks on some 800-1,000 visa refusals a year to see whether decisions are consistent and fair, and makes an annual report to parliament suggesting any improvements he thinks necessary. </p> <p>Singh is the second person to hold the job - his predecessor was Dame Elizabeth Anson, one of the Tory \"great and good\". At the bar, his is the first generation of Asian lawyers to make it into the top chambers. \"When I was a student, I had no role models,\" he says. </p> <p>Born in this country to Sikh immigrants from India, he grew up in a working-class part of Bristol and went to the city's grammar school. At Trinity College, Cambridge, he took a double first in law, then spent a year at the University of California at Berkeley on a Harkness fellowship. \"That's when I became interested in constitutional law and human rights. In a very serious way, my thinking on human rights was directly influenced by my experience in America. That's what induced me to come to the bar. I wanted to contribute to - dare one say it? - justice.\" </p> <p>He did his pupillage in the leading public law chambers at 4-5 Gray's Inn Square, where Cherie Booth also practised, staying there until, with Booth and a group of barristers from those and other chambers, he left to set up Matrix. Like most barristers in the public law field, he acts both for and against the government. But in view of his new role, he has decided not to do immigration cases for either side while he holds the post. </p> <p>Singh, now for younger lawyers the role model that he lacked himself, is highly visible in court, wearing a turban in place of a barrister's wig. No black or Asian lawyer has yet made it to the high court bench. But few doubt that, a dozen or so years from now, a turbaned judge will sit in the royal courts of justice.</p>",
  "Hopes of defusing the Middle East crisis suffered a new blow last night when Lebanon's Hizbullah movement claimed to have captured an Israeli intelligence officer - another card to add to three kidnapped soldiers it is already holding. <p>It seemed likely to cast a further shadow over today's Sharm el-Sheikh summit in Egypt, called by President Bill Clinton as a desperate attempt to halt the two-week spiral of violence between Israelis and Palestinians. </p> <p>Reports from Lebanon yesterday named the man as Hanan Tennenbaum, described as an agent of the Mossad secret service. But Israeli officials insisted he was a businessman who had gone missing in Switzerland several days ago. </p> <p>Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, secretary-general of Hizbullah, made the dramatic announcement at a meeting of Muslim leaders in Beirut. </p> <p>In Jerusalem last night, an Israeli minister, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a former army chief of staff, hinted that tough action would be taken against both Hizbullah and Lebanon. </p> <p>But he also signalled that Israel might be prepared to negotiate with the radical Shi'ite Muslim organisation. </p> <p>Israeli Radio said that relatives of the businessman, who holds the army reserve rank of colonel, had reported him missing a few days ago after he had left for a trip abroad. </p> <p>Another report said Mr Tennenbaum had been kidnapped by business partners and transferred to Hizbullah. Swiss officials said they were investigating the allegation. </p> <p>\"We are checking information and searching in Switzerland but we cannot confirm that action took place on Swiss territory,\" said Rolf Debrunner, a spokesman for the justice and police ministry. </p> <p>The missing Israeli is understood to have been working for the Israeli electronics and telecommunications company Tadiran. </p> <p>There is evidence that Switzerland is a fertile ground for a covert war between Israel and Islamic extremists. In June, the Swiss supreme court handed down a one year suspended jail sentence on a Mossad agent caught by Swiss police during a surveillance operation on a suspected Hizbullah activist three years ago. Several Islamic militants live in exile in Switzerland. </p> <p>Ephraim Sneh, Israel's deputy minister of defence, confirmed that there was a man of that name, but described him as a private individual. Mr Sneh implied that Israel would be calling on the International Red Cross to take up the case, though it has so far failed to provide any information about the whereabouts of the missing soldiers, seized after a border gun battle earlier this month. </p> <p>The brother of one of the three said yesterday that the family had heard nothing at all from any source. </p> <p>Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, has interceded with the Lebanese authorities. On past precedent there is also likely to be a low-profile effort by Germany, exploiting its close relations with Iran, Hizbullah's most powerful patron. </p> <p>A decade ago, quiet UN diplomacy did much to help secure the release of the last of the western hostages held by Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon. </p> <p>Sheikh Nasrallah said further details would be announced \"at the appropriate time\". But his reference to a \"complicated security operation\" appeared to confirm suspicions of a kidnapping or sting operation. </p> <p>Hizbullah has already said it wants to swap the three soldiers for Arab prisoners held in Israel. Israel is still seeking to clarify the fate of an air force navigator, Ron Arad, who was shot down over Lebanon in 1986. </p> <p>In the past Lebanese prisoners held by Israel have been exchanged for the remains of Israeli troops killed in action, in complex and secretive deals brokered by the Red Cross. </p> <p>It is an article of faith that Israel will go to extraordinary lengths to bring its boys home. The Lebanese leader said that the latest kidnapping, like the seizure of the soldiers, was to show support for the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza strip. According to the latest figures, 100 people, mostly Palestinians, have been killed in the clashes. </p> <p>Hizbullah officials meanwhile called on residents of South Lebanon not to approach the border fence for fear of an Israeli attack. </p> <p>Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, pulled Israeli forces out of Lebanon last May, fufilling an election pledge made on the grounds that a more effective defence could be mounted from inside the border. Israel had occupied parts of South Lebanon since 1978, when it launched a massive operation against the PLO.</p> <p><b>Prisoners they want to swap</b></p> <p><b> Hizbullah</b> wants Israel to release 15 Lebanese prisoners, including two senior leaders. The Palestinians have asked Hizbullah to include about 1,600 Palestinian prisoners in any swap </p> <p><b> Iran</b> wants four of its nationals believed to have been held by Israel since the 1982 Lebanon war to be included in an exchange </p> <p><b> Israel</b> wants back three of its soldiers, who were captured last week just over the Lebanese border, and presumably also the \"businessman\" whose capture was announced yesterday. It is also seeking information about an air-force navigator, Ron Arad, missing since 1986</p>",
  "Liberal Democrats in Wales yesterday seized the long awaited opportunity of putting their policies into practice in government by voting overwhelmingly in support of a three year partnership agreement with the minority Labour administration in the Welsh assembly. <p>The junior partners in the new coalition will take up two seats in the nine strong assembly cabinet in a reshuffle due to be announced by Labour first secretary Rhodri Morgan today. </p> <p>As part of the new arrangement the Liberal Democrat leader in the assembly, Mike German, will become deputy first secretary. Discussions on the division of cabinet portfolios were taking place between the party leaders last night. </p> <p>The coalition, modelled on the agreement between the two parties in Scotland, is due to remain in force until the next assembly elections in 2003. </p> <p>It was thrashed out in secret talks earlier this month in a bid to usher in a period of stable government in Cardiff following the turbulence that has marked the past 17 months of minority rule. </p> <p>The agreement, which triggered the resignation of the Labour education and culture secretary, Tom Middlehurst, in protest at the offer of cabinet seats to the Liberal Democrats, is founded on a partnership document that includes many of the policies on which the Lib Dems fought the 1999 assembly elections. </p> <p>Despite the initial disquiet of some Liberal Democrat members at the clandestine nature of the discussions, delegates to the party's autumn conference yesterday voted 130 to 11 in favour of the deal. </p> <p>Labour assembly members and the Labour executive in Wales had already given their approval. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, hailed the vote as a good day for Wales and for devolution. He said the assembly now had the stability it had lacked. </p> <p>\"Today's decision will increase confidence in the assembly and allow it to deliver changes - most of them in the Liberal Democrat manifesto - which will make a real difference to the lives of the people of Wales.\" </p> <p>Among the initiatives to have been agreed is the recruitment of 700 teachers to help reduce class sizes for eight to 11 year olds, the provision of an extra \u00a360m to support farmers and rural communities, and an immediate investigation into student hardship and funding. </p> <p>Agreement has also been reached on a review of voting systems for local government elections in Wales with a committment to pressing Westminster to bring forward assembly sponsored legislation to implement the review's conclusions.</p>",
  "Relations between France and Monaco are at their worst in decades following a threat by Paris to sever ties unless the tiny principality revises its legal system and tackles money laundering. <p>Already criticised this summer by a parliamentary inquiry into cross-border financial crime, Monaco - which has just 35,000 inhabitants but harbours 340,000 bank accounts - has now come under even fiercer fire from the French economic affairs and justice ministries. </p> <p>Ministers Laurent Fabius and Elisabeth Guigou said in their reports that there were \"serious gaps\" in Monaco's anti money-laundering legislation and \"large discrepancies between banking law and reality\". Unless agreement could be reached on a \"complete re-examination\" of economic, financial and judicial arrangements between the two states, they said, the government would impose new legislation. </p> <p>The tax haven and playground for the super-rich, ruled for 700 years by the Grimaldis, Europe's longest-reigning royal family, has had image problems ever since Princess Grace died in a car accident in 1982. </p> <p>Princess Caroline made a name for herself as a topless model, and Princess Stephanie was photographed having sex in a swimming pool before her former bodyguard and now ex-husband was snapped in the arms of Miss Erotic Belgium. </p> <p>Last year reports began circulating about a fraud in commemorative postage stamps from which several members of the royal family were alleged to have profited, including his Serene Highness Prince Rainier. </p> <p>But senior figures in Monaco have reacted furiously. The chief minister, Patrick Leclercq - one of the many officials who administer the principality on secondment from French ministries - said: \"Both these reports contain numerous mistakes and incomprehensible inexactitudes. </p> <p>\"I can only assume that during France's presidency of the EU, France wants to prove a point... by putting on such an extraordinary show of toughness.\" Prince Albert, heir to the throne, said he was \"shocked and disappointed\" by the allegations, which were \"aimed once again at reinforcing the idea of Monaco as a place built for and by the very rich\". </p> <p>The ties of \"protective friendship\" linking France and Monaco are based on a 1918 treaty in which Paris undertook to guarantee Monaco's sovereignty and security. </p> <p>Paris now wants the Monte Carlo casino, owned by the Grimaldis and long suspected of money laundering, to be placed under the control of French customs authorities; Monaco's 70 financial institutions to declare all their bank accounts; and the financial crime unit to be reinforced.</p>",
  "Squirrel monkeys have become addicted to marijuana in laboratory tests, according to research published today in a science magazine. The findings will be a blow to campaigners who argue that cannabis is non-addictive and should be legalised. <p>\"These findings suggest that marijuana has as much potential for abuse as drugs such as cocaine,\" Steven Goldberg, from the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, reports in Nature Neuroscience. </p> <p>Professor Goldberg and two colleagues at the institute in Maryland, trained the monkeys to press a lever 10 times to inject themselves with intravenous cocaine. When a salt solution was substituted, the monkeys gradually stopped pressing the lever. </p> <p>When the researchers replaced the salt solution with a solution of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the chemical in marijuana which alters mood, the monkeys returned to the lever. </p> <p>The monkeys gave themselves about 30 injections during a one-hour session. Prof Goldberg's team calculated that the amount of drug absorbed by the monkeys in an hour was - weight for weight - about the same as that absorbed by a human adult smoking a marijuana cigarette. </p> <p>Prof Goldberg said that self administration was evidence of addiction, a theory that had been tested repeatedly since the 1950s. \"It has been used with any new drug, to see whether or not it has abuse potential. You check it in animals before you go on to humans. Those procedures were validated by checking virtually all psychoactive drugs. There are virtually no exceptions. Drugs that people abuse, animals intravenously self administer.\" </p> <p>But until now, the exceptions have been hallucinogens used in anti-psychotic treatments - and marijuana. There has been tentative evidence in the past that marijuana is addictive, but campaigners have been able to dismiss it as inconclusive, even though 100,000 in the US each year seek treatment for marijuana dependence, and many see it as a pathway to heroin or other drugs. </p> <p>Smoking marijuana has also been found to increase fivefold the risk of a heart attack in the first hour after inhalation. </p> <p>But a huge proportion of people in Britain claims to have used cannabis without harm. The Conservative party announced a \"zero tolerance\" policy for drugs, and was embarrassed to hear seven front benchers admit to having used the drug. There is also pressure from doctors and researchers who are anxious to explore THC as a medical tool. </p> <p>Marijuana was widely used by doctors until earlier this century. Queen Victoria was reputed to have been prescribed it for period pains. There is a body of evidence that shows it can relieve glaucoma, a form of blindness, and ease the suffering of people with multiple sclerosis. </p> <p>The latest finding creates few problems for the medical lobby, who see synthetic forms of THC as useful prescription drugs, possibly administered in a suppository. But it challenges the argument that marijuana is harmless. </p> <p>However, the Maryland team will be criticised for using just four monkeys in the experiment. In 1981 Prof Goldberg made the same discovery with nicotine and tobacco prompting the US surgeon general's report which began to undermine the tobacco industry and bring about anti-smoking legislation - it was 10 years before other scientists came to the same conclusions using different methods. </p> <p>Prof Goldberg said: \"The fact that animals did not appear to self administer THC has frequently been used to support the idea that it is different from other abused drugs. This is no longer true.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tough controls on Railtrack and operating companies are to be imposed this month by Britain's two railway regulators. </p> <p>The rail regulator, Tom Winsor, will produce a more effective control of Railtrack while the shadow strategic rail authority will attempt to stamp its authority on the industry by removing a rail franchise from one unsatisfactory operator. </p> <p>After watching five years of privatisation, during which the industry has grown by 30%, Mr Winsor is to tighten up procedures for Railtrack over the next five years. He is expected to police Railtrack more closely than his two predecessors were able to. </p> <p>He will use his authority to ensure that Railtrack delivers the government's \u00a330bn investment programme recently announced by the deputy prime minister John Prescott. </p> <p>Railtrack will not be immediately penalised for failing to perform to standards laid down by Mr Winsor. It will be given the opportunity to mend its ways, but if it cannot achieve the regulator's standards, it will receive financial penalties. </p> <p>The regulator has started taking steps to improve Railtrack's financial operation. He wants to see a clearer financial breakdown between maintaining the railway and enhancing it. </p> <p>Mr Winsor will tell Railtrack that it needs to set up a computer database containing the latest accurate information about the state of the railway. At the moment the information is incomplete and bewildering to operators. Railtrack will almost certainly strongly disagree with the review and could call on the competition commission to intervene, even though the company is a private monopoly. </p> <p>Mr Winsor has enjoyed an uneasy relationship with Railtrack since taking over his job in July last year. But Railtrack handles millions of pounds of taxpayers' money and the government sees the regulator as its bulwark against poor administration of the railway. </p> <p>Ministers have decided not to intervene in the SSRA's decision to agree a new 20-year-old deal for one of London's biggest computer rail franchises. </p> <p>The French-owned company Connex is to lose the franchise to Go Ahead, which operates Thameslink Trains.</p>",
  "Arching steeply over the Danube, the Rainbow bridge is back in use again, at least for pedestrians. Opening it ceremonially to car traffic, 18 months after Nato destroyed its predecessor and the two other bridges in this elegant city, was meant to have been one of the high points of Slobodan Milosevic's election campaign last month. <p>But the work was not finished in time, and the first people to cross the bridge were not grateful citizens thanking their president, but angry protesters who brushed police aside a fortnight ago in one of the many nationwide demonstrations against the Yugoslav leader's election fraud. </p> <p>Instead of being a symbol of Yugoslavia's revival after Nato's air strikes, the bridge represents the tension between Belgrade and Vojvodina, the region of which Novi Sad is the capital. </p> <p>\"The bridge is actually illegal,\" says Radoje Cvetkov, the city's main architect and planner. \"Only three metres wide, each of the two lanes is much too narrow and the angle is too steep. If cars break down or get stuck on ice in the winter, there will be chaos. But, as with most things, Belgrade just went ahead without consulting us.\" </p> <p>European Union leaders confirmed on Saturday that they would provide the money to remove the debris from the other two bridges that still lie in the water in Novi Sad. </p> <p>\"Once the work starts, it will only take between two and three months to provide a wide enough channel for barges and ships to pass. The river has not frozen for the last 20 years, so winter is not a serious factor,\" Mr Cvetkov says. \"To clear the width of the whole river may take another three months\". </p> <p>The closure of the 1,750-mile waterway has had serious effects on Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, as well as Yugoslavia. Reopening it has been snarled in political arguments. </p> <p>Mr Milosevic insisted that the work be supervised by a Yugoslav (presumably one of his loyalist nominees), while the Danube commission, the long-standing body which represents all the riparian countries, wanted an independent figure who would put the work out to open tender. </p> <p>The EU was willing to give aid for clearing the debris but not - as Mr Milosevic was demanding - aid for rebuilding the bridges, because the latter could be seen as paying reparations for Nato's airstrikes. In either case, no money was to be paid while Mr Milosevic wasstill president. </p> <p>Now he has fallen and the money will flow. Mr Cvetkov is confident that help will also come for rebuilding the main suspension bridge, which sags spectacularly into the water. </p> <p>\"I think it's realistic to expect help,\" he says. \"After all, Nato always said it was bombing Milosevic, not the Serbian people.\" </p> <p>With money due to flow from Brussels, and probably Washington too, the main issue now for the post-Milosevic leaders in Novi Sad is how to get more money from Belgrade. The 18-party alliance in power there now, Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), which organised Vojislav Kostunica's election victory last month, swept the board in the regional assembly elections in Vojvodina last week, taking 117 of the 120 seats. </p> <p>\"Kostunica is not a solution for the Vojvodina. He was our standard-bearer in the fight against Milosevic, but he won't do anything for us. Our real struggle is only starting now,\" says the local DOS leader, Nenad Canak, who is chairman of the League of Social-Democrats of Vojvodina. </p> <p>A towering figure, who looks more rather than less formidable as he stumbles round his office on giant crutches after crashing his motorbike, Mr Canak is known as one of the most outspoken men in Serbian politics. </p> <p>\"The thing they call Yugoslavia is a fraud. Yugoslavia doesn't exist. The Yugoslav army is just an occupying force in Montenegro,\" he said. </p> <p>Leaving Montenegro aside, he favours a decentralised but federal Serbia with substantial autonomy for five regions plus Belgrade and a new contract for sharing the powers that would be left to the federal centre. </p> <p>While he favours Vojvodina becoming a republic within Serbia - some in Novi Sad want full independence - he knows that even getting real autonomy will take time. For all his fiery rhetoric, Mr Canak is a realist. </p> <p>\"People supported us as a weapon against Milosevic, not as a vote for autonomy or a republic. I won't force any autonomy changes through. First you need to build up public support,\" he said. </p> <p>Vojvodina used to be the jewel of the Yugoslav economy. It had all the oil refineries and the petrochemical industry, as well as flourishing wheat, corn, and sunflower fields. </p> <p>\"When Milosevic centralised everything under Belgrade's control, he took our resources and our money. Some 42% of Serbia's budget revenue came from here. Now we have to start getting it back and filling our institutions with real power,\" Mr Canak explained. </p> <p>\"The stereotype of Vojvodina is that we are slow and peaceful. It is wrong. This was always a military border area, so we are descendants of soldiers and are very tough. But we have learned that tolerance is the cheapest way of existence.\" </p> <p>In the streets of Novi Sad ordinary people seem to agree: \"Independence is unnecessary and expensive. We will be part of Europe now anyway. That's what matters,\" commented Tibor Wajda, 55, a Hungarian-speaking theatre director. </p> <p>\"For political reasons we can't get more autonomy. We need economic autonomy from Belgrade. That's all,\" said Dragan Vujanovic, who worked as a sound engineer for state TV for 10 years. \"Everyone wanted to get out of Milosevic's Yugoslavia, not secede from the Serbian people.\"</p>",
  "A meeting that could seal the fate of the Athens Olympics takes place today between the woman in charge of the project, Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, and the prime minister, Costas Simitis. <p>It follows a week of feverish speculation in the Greek capital that Ms Angelopoulos - who led Greece's winning bid to host the 2004 Olympics, and then had to be brought back in six months ago to rescue the preparations after withering criticism from the head of the international Olympic committee (IOC) - is about to resign because of disputes with government ministers. </p> <p>Ms Angelopoulos wants the back-stabbing to stop and the red tape untied. </p> <p>There is already some sense of panic about whether the city will be ready, and should Ms Angelopoulos quit, plans for 2004 will be in worse turmoil; some even say the games could go with her. </p> <p>\"If Gianna goes, then the red phase will have been reached,\" an IOC official, who asked not to be named, said this week. He was referring to an extraordinary public warning in April from the IOC president, Juan Antonio Samaranch. He told the Greeks that there were three categories of organisation of the Olympics: green, where everything is proceeding smoothly; yellow, where there are \"many problems\"; and red, where the \"games are in danger\". </p> <p>Greece, he said, was \"at the end of the yellow phase\". </p> <p>Many of the promises made when Athens won the games in 1997 have not been kept, and the local organisers have become mired in Greece's notorious bureaucracy. </p> <p>\"The games are coming home,\" Ms Angelopoulos, 45, had said in Sydney. But to what? </p> <p>Greek government officials insist that everything is on schedule; with a new underground expected to ease traffic, and a new airport scheduled to open in March 2001, the capital is being transformed, they say. </p> <p>But there are many worrying gaps. The sites for the athletes' and media villages have still not been chosen. The new airport built by a German company is ready, but there are no road or rail connections. </p> <p>When Greece won the bid, it said that 70% of the sports venues were in place, but three years later that figure remains unchanged. The IOC wants the sites ready by November 2003 so they can be properly tested; the Greeks say they will not be ready until May 2004. </p> <p>After Mr Samaranch's broadside, Mr Simitis, who had initially snubbed Ms Angelopoulos - the rumour was that she wanted too much power - asled her to mend the damage, despite misgivings from some in his ruling Socialist party. </p> <p>Ms Angelopoulos, who is married to a shipping tycoon, Theodore Angelopoulos, is a former conservative MP who the Socialists suspect of having political ambitions still. </p> <p>One minister said last week: \"This [the Olympics] is the biggest thing to happen to Greece this decade. Do you think we're going to let her take the credit?\" </p> <p>Since taking on the role as president of the Athens 2004 organising committee (Athoc) six months ago, Ms Angelopoulos is generally credited with injecting a sense of urgency into preparations for the games, and with improving relations with a jittery IOC. </p> <p>But in Greece's febrile politics, she has also had to brave a lot of criticism from politicians and the media; this, she says, has undermined the project. \"I don't think that we will fail,\" Ms Angelopoulos said, \"but they must leave us alone to do our work. When you are trying to cover your back, you can't devote yourself to your task.\" </p> <p>The knives were out for her even before the Olympic flag had arrived in Greece from the Sydney games on October 3. </p> <p>She came under fire from politicians and the media for \"excessive\" spending on hospitality in Sydney. There was wrangling about her officials' salaries as well as her demands that she be given more authority to cut through the bureaucratic delays that have cast doubt on Athens's ability to stage the games. </p> <p>She was also criticised for not returning from Sydney on the same plane as Greece's athletes and officials - she flew in her private jet. </p> <p>Speculation about her future increased after a \"clear-the-air\" meeting with Mr Simitis on October 5, after which she announced she was taking a week off \"for personal reasons\", and reports of a split in the five-member Athoc executive committee. </p> <p>\"What's up with Gianna?\" asked one newspaper headline, while another bayed \"2004 pieces!\" The bickering reached such a pitch last week that Jacques Rogge, the IOC executive monitoring the project, stepped in to call for a ceasefire. </p> <p>Mr Rogge will head an IOC delegation to Greece in November to assess progress. </p> <p>At today's meeting Ms Angelopoulos wants an assurance from the prime minister that she retains his support. She also wants a commitment that he will act to control his ministers. </p> <p>Staff at the Athens 2004 office were playing down the significance of their boss's \"break\" last night, saying she was in London visiting her children. Even if she did quit, they added, the games would not be doomed. \"Look how many times they changed the management in Sydney,\" said one. \"And they didn't take the games from them.\" </p> <p>Given the potential for new embarrassment to the country, however, some Greeks are thinking the unthinkable - that it might be better if the games went elsewhere. As an MP from the Coalition of the Left said: \"If Greece loses the games, we will hate the rest of the world. If Greece keeps the games, and then screws it up, the rest of the world will hate us. I know which I'd prefer.\"</p>",

  "The judges of Canada's supreme court have voted to stop being addressed as my lord and my lady (and your lordship and your ladyship). They sent round a note to lawyers last week telling them to drop that form of address, which one judge described as anachronistic and embarrassing. They would prefer to be called, in or out of court, Justice Smith or whatever. Is it not time for our judiciary to reconsider their court titles? At the moment, all judges of the high court and above are addressed as my lord or my lady. <p>But neither high court nor appeal court judges are in fact peers; there is no logical reason to address them as if they were. It's a historical tradition, born of their original wish to be seen as grand and important. </p> <p>That is no longer a valid reason. Senior judges in most countries with English-type legal systems are happy enough to be addressed as your honour, or justice, without feeling that the appellation is demeaning or undermines their status. It's different with the law lords, who are real lords - for the time being - and entitled to be called my lord. But they, I'm sure, will soon(ish) become a supreme court unlinked to the second chamber, which would be the moment to abolish these forms for the whole senior judiciary. </p> <p>It has always seemed strange to me that our best judges have not said or written a great deal about what they know best - judging. Yes, there have been judicial memoirs, usually written by retired judges who, on the whole, lack writing skills and have little of interest to impart. Lord Denning, the former master of the rolls, wrote several books in the late 70s and early 80s, but they were little more than a knock-about run-around of Denning's Greatest Hits. The only top judge I've read who has written intelligently about the job was the great Lord Devlin, in his brilliant book, The Judge. </p> <p>I'm delighted that Lord Bingham - former lord chief justice, now senior law lord - has now joined the very small club of judges who have real insight, interesting thoughts and an elegant command of language. The Business of Judging (Oxford University Press) is a selection of his public lectures, speeches in the House of Lords and occasional writings. Only a minority of the wide-ranging collection is about judging, but the chapters on judicial independence and judicial ethics in particular are exceptionally thoughtful and illuminating. There's even a brief discussion on whether or not a judge should be entitled to drink in a pub near the court in which he's sitting. (No, not within a mile). </p> <p>The most inexplicable (and never properly explained ) omission of this government in the criminal justice field is its failure to abolish the mandatory life sentence for murder. Just about everybody with any knowledge wants it to go, including all the top judges. Lord Bingham, in his book, reminds me of another passionate supporter of getting rid of it. \"A mercy killing is of a different moral order from a sadistic, sex-based child murder. I would suggest that it is beyond argument that murder embraces such a multitude of diverse sins that the single mandatory life sentence must be inappropriate.\" A House of Lords debate, 1989. The speaker: Lord Irvine of Lairg.</p>",
  "<p>The EU is planning to cut a third of its nuclear inspectors in a move which a weapons safeguard expert says could lead to nuclear bomb material being diverted to rogue states. </p> <p>Wilhelm Gmelin, who until last month was director of nuclear safeguard for Europe said with 500 tonnes of plutonium in the EU, \"we risk a downward spiral of lax controls\". </p> <p>The 272-strong staff at the Euratom safeguards office, which is responsible for making sure plutonium and uranium is not diverted from civil to military use, is to be cut by 93 posts under plans sent by the commission to the European parliament. </p> <p>Mr Gmelin said that \"disarmament goes hand in hand with confirmation that states are no longer producing fissile material for nuclear weapons.\" For example, \"within the EU the UK has declared that it is no longer producing fissile material for nuclear weapons use, but this statement is, so far, not verifiable\". </p> <p>Mr Gmelin, who held the director's post since 1986, criticised the proposed cuts at a plutonium conference in Brussels. </p> <p>He said: \"We must work hard to convince the public and politicians of the necessity of an adequately financed and effective nuclear safeguards system.\" </p> <p>Mr Gmelin said the cuts risk undoing past monitoring of nuclear material and \"all the time pretending that we are maintaining standards. It would put the EU at risk of reneging on international agreements and European law.\" </p> <p>The issue is particularly sensitive because of Bill Clinton's attempts to take plutonium and uranium out of US and Russian weapons use. The UK in its strategic defence review put weapons grade plutonium back into civilian safeguards as part of this process. </p> <p>Mr Gmelin's is also concerned about the use of plutonium at Sellafield in a fuel called MOX, which British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) had intended to export to Japan. It was manufacturing practices at a demonstration plant for MOX which led to the falsification scandal last year and a safety inquiry. </p> <p>Although there was no question that plutonium had been misplaced, Mr Gmelin said new plutonium business put extra strain on the inspectorate even if numbers were not reduced. </p> <p>In Brussels, Gilles Gantelet, a spokesman for the energy commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, said cuts in the inspection budget were still at draft stage.</p>",
  "The death of Harold Williams in prison last week was a poignant reminder not just that innocent people can be convicted in Britain but that they are discriminated against in the prison system, which treats the guilty more favourably. <p>In the first place, the innocent serve longer sentences. Williams, whose case was referred to appeal by the criminal cases review commission last August, was convicted in 1977. He would have been released on parole in 1988 had he been prepared to admit his guilt. That was something he would never do, so he remained a prisoner. </p> <p>His case is by no means unusual. The solicitor Campbell Malone has a number of clients in the same position, including Neil Edgington, whose case is still with the CCRC. \"Neil has been in custody since September 1981, and he had a tariff of 16 years,\" says Malone. \"He has had glowing reports about his conduct in prison, but he has recently been refused both parole and a reduction in his categorisation - because he protests his innocence.\" </p> <p>The prison service acknowledges that \"it is unlawful to refuse to recommend release solely on the ground that the prisoner continues to deny guilt\", but contends that \"minimisation and denial of offending are good indicators of continuing risk\". </p> <p>Officially, a prison has to proceed on the basis that the conviction is safe. This is, in principle, the only practical policy, but in practice it will exacerbate the injustice already done to the wrongly convicted prisoner. </p> <p>There are tremendous incentives for a prisoner to admit guilt. He will be able to earn privileges, which could include more time out of his cell and more visits from his family, and will be able to progress through the system, being re-categorised downwards, in preparation for his ultimate release date. </p> <p>However this \"progress\" will be measured by whether he takes part in offending behaviour courses run by psychologists, all of which are predicated on the basis that the prisoner is prepared to admit guilt. If he refuses, he is deemed to be ineligible for the courses and not cooperating with his sentence plan. So he will lose privileges and parole opportunities. This puts otherwise model prisoners in a confrontational position with officers and results in their being labelled \"difficult\" merely because they assert their innocence. </p> <p>The issue has long concerned Dr David Wilson, a former prison governor, who is now professor of criminal justice at the University of Central England. \"Lots of sceptical prison staff and criminal justice professionals will say dismissively, 'Oh, they all claim to be innocent', but that attitude fails to recognise that prisoners are under constant pressure to acknowledge their guilt, with the temptations of more privileges and an earlier release date, and that it is actually very difficult for a prisoner to continue to assert his innocence.\" </p> <p>Another of Malone's clients, Susan May, recently had her case referred to appeal. \"At that point, Susan was moved from Durham, where she was settled into a routine, to a different prison, on the basis that there were more courses there that were suitable for her,\" says Malone. </p> <p>\"The move put her under unnecessary mental pressure at an emotionally difficult time. The idea that she suddenly 'confront her guilt' just when her case had been referred is arrant nonsense. </p> <p>\"You sometimes have to wonder whether there is a deliberate policy to try to break the spirits of prisoners claiming to be innocent.\" </p> <p>Prison psychologists generally describe prisoners who protest their innocence as \"in denial\". However, the setting-up of the CCRC and the Simms and O'Brien judgment at the House of Lords (allowing prisoners to receive visits from the media) were both based on the knowledge that there are innocent people in British prisons. </p> <p>One prison where matters have come to a head is Frankland in Durham, where 40 prisoners who are protesting their innocence are launching a legal action against the governor. Sharmila Salvi, of the Manchester law firm Olliers, who has taken on the case, explains: \"Many prisoners went to Frankland on enhanced status but were downgraded on arrival to standard status because they were not complying with their sentence plan. In other words, they could not take part in offending behaviour courses because to do so would mean admitting guilt.\" </p> <p>The relevant prison service order issued by the Home Office says that privilege levels should be \"portable\" between different prisons and also that targets set in a sentence plan must be \"realistically expected of the prisoner\". </p> <p>Privileges that go with enhanced status at Frankland can include all- day visits, television sets, single-cell accommodation and cooking facilities. Salvi says: \"We will be arguing that the policy at Frankland is unlawful and discriminatory in respect of prisoners who are asserting their innocence.\"</p>",
  "<p>Some people thrive in the face of adversity. Captain Riette Everton is one of those people. In <strong> Witness: Satanic Crimes</strong> (Channel 4, Sunday), she was dressed up like a deckchair at Cowes and chuckling like a beaver. As one half of South Africa's occult-related Crimes Squad, Riette and her boss, Colonel Kobus Jonker - who is equally stoic and wears a Donald Duck tie - investigate crimes like that committed by a woman with supernatural leanings in a suburb of Cape Town. She lured a heavily pregnant 16-year-old girl back to her house, handcuffed her to a chair and cut the baby from her stomach, depositing it in a duffel bag before making her escape. </p> <p>Luckily, the local constabulary caught the Satanist before she could do anything devilish to the infant but this case is symptomatic of the growth in \"Satanic crimes\" which has meant Riette and Kobus's workload has increased exponentially over the last five years. In the \"new\" South Africa, graveyards are kept under 24 hour surveillance to deter grave-robbers, the ritual sacrifice of cats is commonplace and heads are often stolen from corpses - or cut from living folks less than willing to give them up - to be used in Satanic initiation ceremonies. (Why they can't use a digestive biscuit like normal people, I don't know). </p> <p>Despite the terrible nature of the crimes they confront, Riette and Kobus are chipper because they have God on their side. He protects them \"more than a gun or a knife or a bulletproof vest\" (not too sure about this myself), and it is Riette's Christian duty to carry on hunting down people who smear cats' brains over their neighbours' front doors and like Iron Maiden. And quite right too. Kobus even visits a man convicted of a Satanic crime - the decapitation of a homeless man - in prison and holds his hand. I mean, the man says he has become a Christian but you can never be too sure. Don't touch the glass, don't pass him anything. </p> <p>The main focus of Witness was the case of Rina Radloff who had her throat slit in her home. After suicide was discounted (three stab wounds in the back put paid to that theory), suspicion fell like a wet blanket on Rina's ex-husband's new wife, Antoinette, who dabbled with the occult. She also dabbled with looking like a drag queen doing a post-op Cher and dressing really badly. In fact, most Satanists dress really badly. This may contribute to their lack of popularity generally. That, and their lack of a poetic soul. Madeleine (or perhaps Mad Elaine) dressed in black and wore chicken legs round her neck. She favoured the bony variety as opposed to the KFC kind (although it looked as though she was quite keen on them as well), and wrote poems like \"Silence equals silence, power equals power, death equals death.\" Hardly All Things Bright And Beautiful, is it? </p> <p>Among the assorted weirdos, Antoinette was the weirdest. She was keen to put paid to the notion that while she could leave her body, she wasn't a shapeshifter (this must be an important distinction in the Satanic world) and hadn't murdered Radloff at all. She is now awaiting trial for murder. As well as for crimes against fashion. </p> <p>It was easy to get carried away with the spooky nature of Witness, but there was a distinct dearth of analysis as to why white South Africans especially are increasingly taking an interest in the occult. Had there been a bit more investigation into that, the documentary could have been lifted well above the sensationalism with which it so often flirted. </p> <p>The skin, as we know, keeps the outside out and the inside in. While it was icky enough to see decapitated cats in Witness, the technicolour detail of the human body of <strong> Superhuman</strong> (BBC1, Sunday) was almost too much to bear, even with the safe hands of Robert Winston guiding us. Inevitably a series people will buy the boxset of \"just to have\", it was undeniably detailed, thorough and Important Television, but there were way too many pictures of gaping wounds and broken bones and big sharp needles puncturing skin for my liking. And did we really need snapping sound effects when being told of broken ribs? Tsk, shame on you, BBC, for such queasy-making nonsense. There's a reason we aren't translucent, and it's that the workings of the human body aren't pretty. More programmes about flowers and cats (alive and intact), please.</p>",
  "<p>Three female singers so dissimilar they could have dropped in from different planets were at work on the jazz circuit last week. One, the Grammy-winning Norwegian vocalist, composer and teacher Sidsel Endreson, is from such a distant musical location that the jazz circuit is hardly the place for her, if it weren't so hard to imagine anywhere more appropriate. </p> <p>The three represent a fascinating contrast with the pop mainstream, yet they all live at a time of erupting resourcefulness in terms of what the human voice might be stretched to do. Singers replicating 1940s Latin swing, firing off the defiant percussive monologues of ghetto rap, synth-bending their voices like electronic instruments, or echoing the soul and funk traditions of Aretha Franklin and Stevie Wonder can comfortably rub shoulders in the pop charts. The musical voice has rarely sounded so varied and fruitful. Against that backdrop, these three improvisers might seem to be existing in a backwater, but in their different ways they influence the mainstream by the independence of their skills. </p> <p>Norma Winstone is a long-respected improviser, composer and lyric-writer with a sound as glancingly muted and supple as a flute. She sings in a complex and ambitious chamber-improv band featuring American pianist Fred Hersch. The other two are in parallel worlds with very little in common but musicality, timing and consummate control of a completely personal sound. At the conservative end, the expatriate American Stacey Kent played the Soho Pizza Express. She put her graceful spin on a programme of Broadway love songs and show tunes so convincingly that a young audience discovered it for the first time, while an older one was filled with nostalgia and respect for a still startling craft. </p> <p>Meanwhile at Ronnie Scott's, the Norwegian Sidsel Endreson baffled some, spooked some and mesmerised others with an utterly personal angle on contemporary vocals that sound like Jan Garbarek's horn lines being sung. Unlike Kent, with her sharp clothes, deft urbanity and knowing wit, Endreson is distant, entranced, ungroomed, private. Yet she let herself free-fall into the distracted atmosphere of a metropolitan nightclub rather than a bare-bulb improv room or a recital hall. She opened with an astonishing 10 minutes of a cappella lament, echoing Nordic folk melodies vanishing into or spiralling into shivery yodels, that left the audience in stunned silence. Endreson's remarkable range of timbre and her conviction that hot licks aren't indispensable to communication left everyone in the room influenced by her imposing presence. \"I was thinking earlier on today, 'What the fuck am I doing here?' \" Endreson asked the audience at the end. Opening ears to what the human voice can do, that's what. </p> <p>When Winstone met the cabaret-jazz superstar Diana Krall on a European tour, she was surprised to find that Krall and her band knew some of Winstone's most exploratory records. \"Funnily enough, she was almost apologetic about her own work by comparison,\" Winstone recalls, \"which she certainly doesn't need to be. I guess I keep wanting to make something different happen, and in material terms that's my downfall. I'll do pieces with John Parricelli and Iain Ballamy that mix free things with Brazilian things; sometimes I'll do songs, sometimes impressionistic things. Maybe if audiences never know what they're going to hear, then it's never going to be that big. But I'm always thinking there's something else to do, something else to discover. That's what keeps me interested.\"</p>",
  "Humility, compassion and fierce independence marked the career of the former Malaysian chief justice Tun Mohamed Suffian Hashim, who has died of cancer aged 82. At much personal cost, he never flinched from his criticism of the destruction of what was once a well-regarded judiciary in Malaysia, primarily by the prime minister, Mahathir Mohamed. <p> Suffian's unabashed belief in the best of the colonial heritage, especially in the administrative and legal systems, brought him into conflict with anti-western, third-world demagoguery which swept away time-honoured methods in favour of quick fixes. In Malaysia, this has meant dramatic changes in the legal system, without much thought, so that Islamic law is on a par with the common law system that the country still attempts to follow. </p> <p>Malaysia changed course in 1981, when Dr Mahathir, on taking office, began to dismantle the status quo. He did it so deliberately - and so completely - that many, including the judiciary, were not aware of its significance until after the fact. </p> <p>The rot began, Suffian often said, when the sixth lord president, Tun Saleh Abas, was removed from office so that Mahathir's political challengers could be neutralised. Since then, he felt, the judiciary had become handmaiden to Mahathir's political manouevres. </p> <p>In 1988, Suffian raised his fears following Mahathir's sacking of judges he perceived as obstacles, and his moves to bring the federal courts under his control. When Mahathir wanted his deputy, Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim, destroyed politically, the judiciary performed the coup de grace by convicting him of sodomy and corruption. </p> <p>Tun Suffian, or \"Suff\" to his friends, paid a heavy price for his criticisms. He was so isolated officially that to many he did not exist. The media ignored him. </p> <p>The son of a kadi, a religious judge, Suffian was born in a remote village in Perak state. He read law at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on a Queen's scholarship, and was called to the bar in 1941. At the outbreak of the second world war, he joined All India Radio, in New Delhi. After the conflict, he returned to London, where he joined the BBC. </p> <p>Appointed to the Malayan civil service, he was posted to Malacca as magistrate and harbour master, a curious appointment justified on the grounds that while there was no provision for a magistrate's salary, there was one for the master of the non-existent harbour. </p> <p>In 1959, Suffian became Malaya's first solicitor-general, and, two years later, a high court judge. In 1973, he became chief justice of Malaysia, and, the following year, lord president. In 1975, he was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for government service, Asia's equivalent of the Nobel Peace Prize. After retirement in 1982, he became an adviser to Standard Chartered Bank, though official opposition prevented his advancement. </p> <p> A private man, he was devoted to his wife, Bunny, whom he had met at Cambridge. Her death in 1997 devastated him, particularly since the Islamic authorities denied her the cremation she had wanted, insisting she be buried under Islamic rites in the Moslem cemetry at Kuala Kangsar. </p> <p>When he became ill, Suffian was cared for by the niece of Malaysia's founding prime minister, Tengku Abdul Rahman, and her husband. He died a disappointed man, having spoken often, in public and private, of how what took generations to build could be destroyed in a day and would take years to rebuild. He had no children. </p> <p> Tun Mohamed Suffian Hashim, judge, born November 12 1917; died September 26 2000</p>",

  "President Bill Clinton is threatening to interfere once again in the search for a peace settlement in the Middle East. If possible he should be kept at arm's length by the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, whose quiet diplomacy has begun to make peace look like a possibility. If Mr Clinton now tries to elbow him aside and to reassert America's control of what should be an international operation, he is likely to fail as he has failed before. If that happens, it will be tragic for the people on both sides, Palestinians and Israelis, for whom a settlement would have brought relief from violence and misery and despair. <p>But one need feel no sympathy for Mr Clinton, whose motivation in bringing together Arabs and Israelis has always seemed to be his own personal ambition to score a foreign policy triumph that might rescue his tattered reputation. In pursuing that ambition, he has masqueraded as a mediator, an \"honest broker\", while all the time he and his team of Middle East advisers have worked, sometimes openly and sometimes surreptitiously, to advance the interests of Israel. </p> <p>It would be more accurate to say that they were pursuing what they took to be the interests of Israel - whereas in fact they were helping to produce the result that we see today: a result tragic for the Palestinians, damaging to the Middle East and likely to be disastrous for the Israelis as well. Israel will never be secure until it can win the goodwill, or at least the tolerance, of its Arab neighbours. It must be obvious to everyone that this fictitious \"peace process\" has only intensified the frustration and bitterness that have found expression in the present Palestinian uprising. </p> <p>The Americans have not merely failed to achieve their stated aim of an equitable settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. Ever since Mr Clinton persuaded Yasser Arafat to shake hands with Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, on the White House lawn in September 1993, the American president and his advisers have actually made a just settlement harder to achieve. </p> <p>Before that meeting there was already a perfectly adequate framework for peace, in the shape of UN resolutions 242 and 338. What was needed was to implement these resolutions, which called on Israel to withdraw from occupied territory in exchange for recognition by the Arabs of Israel and its right to exist behind secure borders. But as the Israelis built settlements all over the occupied territories it became apparent that they had no intention of withdrawing. </p> <p>For a time, the Americans professed to regard the UN resolutions as the basis for the artificial \"peace process\". But gradually they dropped any mention of them, and as the years passed (and the Israeli settlements multiplied), they led the negotiations further away from the United Nations. They resisted every attempt to involve the Europeans or the wider international community in the search for peace in the Middle East. When the Palestine question was debated in the UN security council, the Americans invariably came to the defence of Israel, even to the extent of vetoing resolutions critical of Israeli policies that had the unanimous support of the other council members, including Britain. </p> <p>All this has encouraged the Israelis to think themselves politically invulnerable. Confident of the unfailing support of the US, they could ignore UN resolutions, annex East Jerusalem, build Jewish settlements on Arab land, deny the Palestinians freedom of movement, invade southern Lebanon and bombard whatever targets they chose, up to and including Beirut - all this in defiance of their obligations as members of the UN. This is a scandalous catalogue of illegal activity, in which the underlying responsibility has been that of the US, made worse by the pretence that President Clinton, Madeleine Albright and the rest of them were acting in the interests of peace and justice. </p> <p> So what next? A way must be found to break the US monopoly over Arab-Israeli negotiations and to return the search for peace to where it belongs: the UN. This is what the Europeans should aim for. They have never made use of the influence they possess, and it is time they - especially Britain - played an active role instead of tagging along behind the Americans. </p> <p>It is not a matter of being anti-American or anti-Israeli. The fact is that between them Israel and the US have colluded in a policy designed to favour the Israelis, rather than produce a balanced peace that would take account of the interests of all the peoples concerned. </p> <p>Whether such a peace is still possible, now that a spark has set light to all the pent-up resentment over the failure of the American \"peace process\", it is impossible to say. Certainly it will not be easy, so the sooner a new initiative is taken, the better. The fact that the secretary general of the UN has taken the lead makes a good start. Now let Britain lead the other Europeans in lending him their support. And, if possible, keep Mr Clinton and Mrs Albright out of the picture. </p> <p> Michael Adams is a research fellow in the politics department of Exeter University and a former Middle East correspondent of the Guardian </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "A sweeping Taliban military offensive across the mountains of northern Afghanistan threatens to unleash a refugee crises and a wave of Islamic insurgency and drug smuggling through Central Asia. <p>Four years after seizing power in Kabul, the Taliban Islamic militia has made crucial gains in the past two months in the only area of Afghanistan still outside its control. Now that Taliban troops are sitting along western parts of the 1,000-mile border with Tajikistan, the Tajik government and its backers in Russia are increasingly apprehensive. </p> <p>Tajikistan has barely recovered from a five-year civil war that began only months after the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago. Unemployment runs at more than 50% and most factories have fallen into ruin. This year a severe drought threatens the lives of 3m people, half the population. </p> <p>So far Tajikistan has kept its Afghan border formally shut, fearing the impact of a flood of refugees. Aid agencies in the capital, Dushanbe, say up to 100,000 Afghans would descend on the country's southern provinces, the area worst affected by drought, if the Taliban made further advances. </p> <p>\"The large humanitarian catastrophe could be greater than that in Kosovo, one of the biggest in the world,\" Sergei Ivanov, the head of Russia's security council, was reported as saying last week. Moscow opposes the Taliban and is keen to increase its own influence in Central Asia. </p> <p>Radical Islamic groups in Tajikistan, it is feared, would be inspired if the Taliban seized the remaining 10% of Afghanistan. Islamic militants are believed already to be moving from Afghanistan through the narrow strip in the centre of Tajikistan and onward north into Kyrgyzstan and the Ferghana valley, where hardliners have long wanted a separate Muslim homeland. </p> <p>\"There is a very real threat of a spread of Islamism in Tajikistan,\" said an aid worker in Dushanbe. \"There are a lot of different divisions of radical Islamists.\" </p> <p>One of the region's leading rebel groups, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), which has bases in the mountains of Tajikistan and wants to overthrow the secular Uzbek government, was added to the US state department's list of terror organisations last month. </p> <p>Uzbekistan accuses one of the parties in the governing coalition of Tajikistan - the United Tajik Opposition - of supporting the rebels. In August IMU rebels fought their way to within 60 miles of the Uzbek capital, Tashkent. </p> <p>In the northern Tajik province of Leninabad, the Hizut Tahir movement, an Islamic group based on small, independent cells, has been pushing for a separate state. Leninabad is cut off from in winter when snow blocks the only pass. </p> <p>Although 25,000 Russian soldiers guard the Tajik border, drug smuggling from Afghanistan, estimated to produce 70% of the world's heroin, has increased five-fold this year. Rival factories in Afghanistan compete to refine the purest heroin, whose price rises exponentially on the smugglers' trail through Tajikistan to Russia. </p> <p>Some of the most vulnerable parts of the border are guarded not by the Russian army but by soldiers from the United Tajik Opposition, the Islamic group which, though now in Tajikistan's coalition, fought against the government in the civil war. For the Taliban, opium production is a big source of income; this year alone it brought in at least $9m (\u00a36m). </p> <p>The most immediate threat remains the current drought and the danger of a flood of refugees. At least 70,000 people fled the Afghan city of Taloqan when it fell to the Taliban last month. Up to 100,000 more would flee if the Taliban takes the last opposition town, Faizabad. </p> <p>In villages across southern Tajikistan people are on the brink of starvation. The UN's World Food Programme is launching a $62m emergency operation to feed 1m of the most at risk in the next nine months. </p> <p>The drought reduced most of this year's crops to dust. What little water remains is diverted to the state and collective farms which for decades have been forcing a lucrative cotton crop out of an otherwise arid land. </p> <p>Most villagers have used up their meagre savings and sold their livestock. Many were well off under Soviet rule, but now cars sit rusting in garages and even if the old fridges and black and white televisions are still working, there is rarely electricity. </p> <p>Malakhova Bibigul, who works at the Maxim Gorky collective farm near Kurgan-Tyube, lost her husband in the civil war. She has eight children but an annual income equalling just a few founds from her work in the farm's cotton fields. </p> <p>\"I don't know what my future will be,\" she said, clasping the white shawl covering her head. \"I hoped my eldest son would go to school and be able to support the family. But he doesn't go. We can't afford it, he has no money for books. I have lost hope.\" </p> <p>Mrs Bibigul is one of a group of villagers who have been given half a hectare of land by the World Food Programme, together with flour, seeds and fertiliser to survive the winter and grow a crop for next year. </p> <p>These Muslim villagers were once refugees themselves. More than 500,000 fled into Afghanistan during the Tajik civil war. Now they are likely to find families of refugees begging for help at their doors. </p> <p>\"It was difficult living in Afghanistan,\" said Qurbangula, 35, whose husband was also killed in the war. She is one of 60 widows on another collective farm close to the Afghan border who have been given land and seeds. </p> <p>\"But it is better to be hungry and thirsty in your own country than to have enough food but be forced to live abroad.\"</p>",
  "A three-year-old boy who went missing at a remote beauty spot had spent the night huddled under a bush, his rescuers said yesterday. <p>Cameron Munro was found safe and well by a rescue dog and his handler after being missing for 16 hours. He had disappeared at the Highland beauty spot the Falls of Shin, near Dornoch, Sutherland at around 4.30pm on Saturday and was found yesterday about half a mile away. </p> <p>Flight Sergeant Al Sylvester, from RAF Kinloss, one of 34 RAF rescuers who had spent the night searching for the boy, said: \"He was perfectly fine. He wasn't hurt or upset at all. He was talking to himself about dinosaurs and he had been looking for dinosaurs in the woods when he went missing. He had only been out of his mother's sight for seconds.\" </p> <p>Mr Sylvester added: \"When he was found he was a little cold, he must have slept through the night. He was quite sheltered but it is still incredible he survived. </p> <p>\"He lives in a farm area and he must be a hardened wee boy with a real will to live.\" </p> <p>Cameron, from Ardgay, was reported missing from a play area at the Falls of Shin visitor centre by his mother who was also with his two-year-old sister. </p> <p>A full-scale search was mounted with three mountain rescue teams, helicopters fitted with heat-seeking equipment from the coastguard and RAF Kinloss, police officers, sniffer dogs and scores of volunteers. </p> <p>Mountain rescue teams continued the hunt overnight and a full-scale search resumed at first light. </p> <p>Mr Sylvester said a dog found Cameron sitting in the undergrowth yesterday morning. \"The feeling is just fantastic but we were convinced that we were going to find him alive.\" </p> <p>Cameron was released from Raigmore Hospital in Inverness after a check-up.</p>"
