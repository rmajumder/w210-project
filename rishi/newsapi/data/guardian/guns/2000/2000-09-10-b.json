  "<p>Anyone who has watched BBC2's recent series Brain Story could be forgiven for being slightly in awe of Professor Susan Greenfield, as she delves into our most incredible and unfathomable organ. Greenfield is, after all, professor of pharmacology at Oxford University, a key figure in the international field of neuroscience, author, broadcaster and the first woman in the past two centuries to be director of the Royal Institution. </p> <p>And who works for a boss like this? Answer: the charming and self-effacing Viv Pearson, 51, who has spent the past 18 months as Greenfield's PA. \"You need a lot of stamina to keep up with her,\" she says. \"She is very fair but she works at 110% all the time and hasn't got a free evening until December.\" </p> <p>Hardly surprising, as Greenfield effectively has two day jobs - the professorial role in Oxford and the Royal Institution directorship in London. \"Most of my work is managing her diary and correspondence, booking flights, making sure she has transport and checking that the people she is going to see will look after her properly,\" confirms Pearson. </p> <p>She claims to have no scientific background whatsoever, and says the most daunting aspect of her job is dictation. \"When I first arrived, some of the words Susan was using, like acetylcholinesterace - which I now know is an enzyme - I couldn't even get my tongue round. But she is very patient.\" </p> <p>As for her working environment, any of us conjuring up visions of Hammer Horror flicks, with devilish white-coated technicians sawing up brain tissue, will be disappointed. \"This is a totally brain-free zone. The work on the tissue is done in the labs, and if they are working on something unsavoury, I don't go in,\" Pearson insists. </p> <p>The work carried out in the pharmacology department focuses on a particular group of brain conditions - Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease - all of which are treated by different drugs. \"However, my department is exploring the idea that there is something common to all three conditions. The idea is that they are all triggered by progressive damage to groups of neurons,\" says Pearson, who recalls the time when she came into slightly more contact with the human brain than she would have wished for. </p> <p>\"When the BBC was working on the brain programme, I had to go to collect a brain in formaldehyde. As I was carrying it down the corridor, it leaked all over my dress and drenched my feet. I thought... hmm, interesting.\" </p> <p>Although Pearson is not directly involved in the media spin-off from Greenfield's TV work, she does find herself on the frontline with the general public. \"Since the programme went out, there have been at least two or three calls a day from people who have had something wrong with their brains, or in some cases are terminally ill. They offer to come up to the labs and be used as guinea pigs, or they think Susan is a medic and can cure them. I have to be really sensitive and listen. You can't turn round and say, 'I am sorry, I have to stop you there.' Sometimes I feel really useless. It would be lovely to make them better.\" </p> <p>Although new to the world of neuroscience, Pearson has a solid work track-record, albeit on a part-time basis for many years, while she brought up her two children. And since she is married to a professor she is no stranger to the workings of the academic mind. </p> <p>During her professional life she has worked as a PA in Cyprus, emigrated to South Africa, worked as a secretary to a finance company, and done time as a long-haul air stewardess. Before her present post she was a part-time PA in a firm of surveyors in Oxford. </p> <p>\"By the time I was 48, I felt I was ready for the challenge of a fulltime job,\" she says. But was the world ready for her? \"There is a barrier to older people. Some people think that 50 is really old. I had a couple of interviews and you could see the shutters coming down.\" </p> <p>Pearson first came across her boss-to-be in a national newspaper. \"I read her column and found it fascinating stuff. When I found out that she was looking for someone I knew I wanted the job.\" She describes Greenfield as the sort of woman who doesn't put labels on people, a personality trait that worked in her favour. \"I turned up for the interview at the age of 50, with no science background, but I was keen, enthusiastic and wanted the job.\" </p> <p>And she has every intention of staying. \"I learn something every day. It is all fascinating. When you say science to people, they usually think - ugh! But everyone has a brain. That's why it is such an appealing subject.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Brain Story, by Susan Greenfield, is published by BBC Worldwide at \u00a317.99</p>",
  "<p>How's your memory these days? Eroded by stress and information overload, or still gleaming and purring like a newly-polished Rolls with a finely-tuned engine? Do you spend your working day confidently calling clients and colleagues by their correct names, and only dipping into your appointments diary to access dates beyond the year 2003? Or are you forced go scrabbling off to check your palm-pilot every time anyone asks you for your own mobile number?</p> <p>Having a good memory makes you popular and successful. How charismatic do you sound when you can not only greet people and make introductions, but refer to their kids, pets, star signs and hobbies, and get every detail right every time?</p> <p>Absorbing new information is only useful if it sticks to your brain like gum to the sole of a trainer. Training rates are high in most modern workplaces, but learned information retention rates are woefully low. Check out your colleagues, especially any who have been on a recent course in soft skills. Ninety-nine percent will remember being on a course, especially if it was residential and they got pissed at the bar every night. Forty-three percent may be able to tell you the title of the course or the name of the tutor. Twenty-two percent might even manage to remember a couple of points they learnt on it, but these will only emerge after several sessions in regressive hypnosis and trauma counselling.</p> <p>Every single on of them will be able to tell you what sweeties and biscuits were on offer every day. Which says a lot about how the brain prioritises.</p> <p><strong>Goldfish brains</strong></p> <p>The average goldfish is alleged to have a two-second memory-span, so that by the time it has made one circuit of the bowl it has forgotten all about the castle or bit of duckweed that stands in the middle. You can tell we are turning into a nation of goldfish by the ever-decreasing loops that our brains seem to be working on.</p> <p> I hear the same discussions about Big Brother every three hours or so from work colleagues, usually making the same mundane points, like: \"Of course, don't forget it is primarily a game show, you know,\" but always in a tone that suggests they have discovered another way to split the atom.</p> <p><strong>Error margins</strong></p> <p>Mistakes work on an ever-decreasing loop, too. We make the same spelling mistakes regularly and just as regularly correct them on spellcheck. We forget to glance at the multiple copies display on the photocopier and gawp in surprise every time a stream of unwanted papers spew out. When we enter the building in the morning we push the door market \"pull\" every time.</p> <p>If you want to check the state of your own memory's health, ask yourself how often you do any or all of the following:</p> <p>1. Worry that you forgot to lock the front door when you left home 2. Lose keys or glasses 3. Bump into someone you know your know quite well, but can't place who they are. 4. Go to get coffee and come back having been sidetracked and forgotten it. 5. Forget the name of someone you know reasonably well 6. Forget the number of your mobile phone or fax machine</p> <p><strong>Coping mechanisms</strong></p> <p>Coping with your own forgetfulness is difficult enough, but what if it's the boss whose brain seems to be deleting more from its memory banks than it is storing? Or perhaps it's a colleague or your PA, and you find yourself constantly locked into one of those: \"Why didn't you do it?\" \"Because you never asked me to\" stand-offs.</p> <p>Forgetful admin can be dangerous and frustrating, but a boss with boiled brains can threaten your entire career. A secretary in the health sector had been finding her manager increasingly difficult to track down or get information from. Then she had a day off sick and her husband phoned to let the boss know.</p> <p>\"I'm afraid Caroline won't be in today.\" he told the manager. \"Caroline who?\" asked the boss. \"Prentice.\" There was a long pause. \"Oh, I'm sorry, what time was her appointment?\" the boss asked. The woman had been his secretary for five years and sat at the next desk, but he thought her husband was referring to one of his clients.</p> <p>Prompting others is tricky, especially when the person with selective memory is higher in status. Forgetting annoys us. We would rather argue to the death than admit something has slipped out mind. So how can you survive when all around are losing their marbles, thanks to stress, tension, anxiety and apres-holiday blues?</p> <p>\u0095 Keep your message concise. Limit the points you make. The average brain will take in no more than about five new items into its short-term memory on a good day. Most people in business are having very bad days, so cut that down to two or three. Never overload. Keep it simple.</p> <p>\u0095 Create a pause. Once you have delivered your message, allow them to scan it into their brain. Memories that stick have been captured and printed. Important moments, known as Flashbulb Memories, stay scanned into our brains forever, like the moment you heard the news that Princess Diana was dead.</p> <p>\u0095 Try to paint a picture. Be visually descriptive with your words, as well as just factual. Material that has been visually coded has a greater capacity for sticking in place than that which is acoustically coded. If you are giving your boss an important document you need action on, try to hand it to him/her, rather than just laying it on their desk. Comment on the logo or typeface. Make them study it, if possible.</p> <p>\u0095 Get them to rehearse. Doing something always creates a longer memory than just being told about it. If you are briefing colleagues, ask them to feed back to you afterwards, or do some exercise based on the points being briefed.</p> <p>\u0095 Remember that the brain remembers primary items more easily than things that come later on a list. Put your important point at the start.</p> <p>\u0095 Novelty value We remember things that are different or quirky. Try to make your key points in a way that stands out.</p> <p>\u0095 Repetition The most effectively structured talks work in three stages: 1. Tell them what you are going to say. 2. Tell them 3. Tell them what you just said. In a brief business conversation this could translate to: 'Tony, about that delivery for Parsons.....I need the documentation from you by lunchtime to get the order out.....so, just to clarify, you'll get that form back to me by twelve....' etc.</p> <p>\u0095 Create a memory-trace I have Mike Edden, senior consultant at the Industrial Society to thank for this glorious trick. When you work with a colleague who regularly forgets events or requests, create an effective memory trace for them, to ensure the moment gets captured and printed into their mind. Any slightly off-the-wall or unusual associated moment will do. Once you've handed the colleague the paperwork ask them if they'd like a drink from the machine. If they ask for a tea, bring back Fanta. When they claim to have forgotten the existence of the order form you can jog their memory by reminding them that was the time you got them Fanta instead of Earl Grey.</p>",
  "<p>Bored with lining your boss's pockets? Want to work for a company you feel is doing some good in the world? Join the club. According to the Institute of Business Ethics (IBE), support staff are joining the rapidly swelling ranks of UK workers who are turning their backs on employers with no sense of moral responsibility. </p> <p>\"With last week's news that the government is to drop its ethical foreign policy, there are likely to be even more of them taking it into their own hands to ensure that employers lacking values are employers lacking loyal staff,\" says Simon Webley, IBE research director. But if the foreign office finds it too difficult to stick to its commitments, how easy is it for the support worker to find a truly ethical employer? </p> <p>The voluntary sector is perhaps the most obvious port of call - and one of the most popular. Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO) has just announced a record number of applications, an indication that workers are looking for a job that does more than just pay the bills. \"The most common reasons given were the wish to give something back and a need for personal fulfilment,\" explains Matthew Bell, VSO's director of communications. But bills do need to be paid, and the financial rewards in the voluntary sector will barely cover your weekly groceries, let alone your rent or mortgage. The VSO's national recruitment campaign, launched earlier this year, was upfront about job prospects: \"Lawyers wanted. Salary \u00a3400 per annum. And yes, you did read that correctly.\" </p> <p>Even paid posts within charities - and indeed the public sector - can offer far lower salaries than average. That's why, says Webley, it's good news that more and more private businesses are introducing a \"code of business ethics\" - something that shows staff and prospective staff just how seriously they are taking their moral responsibilities. </p> <p>A typical code will address corporate policy towards its various stakeholders: employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers and the wider public. Standards relating to suppliers, for example, are likely to include a commitment to ensuring that there is no child labour at any stage of its supply chain, and that wages and working hours are reasonable. Meanwhile, standards relating to staff might include policies on what to do if you are offered products - such as stationery - that you suspect have been made by exploiting workers in developing countries. </p> <p>As part of their code, some companies, such as C&amp;A, have set up a trust to send inspectors on regular visits to check the ethical standards and practices of all suppliers - whether in east London or the Far East. Other employers, including Marks &amp; Spencer, and Monsoon, have joined the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), \"a membership body that focuses purely on setting standards for labour within supply chains,\" explains David Steele, its information officer. </p> <p>Nevertheless, research shows that a few employers do write a code of ethics simply to look good. Upon closer inspection, there may be little real commitment. </p> <p>\"That's why it's so important for values-driven secretaries to ask at the interview stage not only whether there is a code, but whether you can see it,\" advises Rachel Ormond, an academic researcher in ethics and employment. \"It will always exist in document form, and increasingly it is included on the company website and in the annual report. </p> <p>\"You might also want to ask whether your prospective employer encourages staff to get involved in giving something back to society,\" she adds. Employees may do voluntary work, for example, either wholly or partly in company time, and usually on projects initiated by the company. Allied Dunbar sends staff on one-month secondments to help with projects in India. And at M&amp;S, 100-hour part-time secondments are set up for staff to help with local community projects, which are carried out over three-month periods. </p> <p>So important are employers' ethics becoming to today's jobseeker that research shows that they are often the deciding factor when a candidate opts for a particular post. \"In reality, pay and training tend to be a higher priority for support staff,\" says a spokesperson for recruitment consultancy Manpower. \"But because it's a jobseekers' market at the moment, they can often take those two for granted.\" </p> <p>The ETI's David Steele claims that media coverage has encouraged workers to take a broader interest in the companies for which they work. \"There has been a recent influx of documentaries and features highlighting conditions in factories overseas, as well as on issues like child labour in this country,\" he says. \"The fact that the internet has created a global economy is also significant. We no longer think of a sweatshop in Korea as being so far away.\" </p> <p>A spokesperson for recruitment agency Adecco adds a further reason: job-seekers have a greater choice in selecting companies they respect and share common values with. \"More employers are 'going ethical' every day. The result is that if you're a secretary who wants to work in, say, the City, you can now pick a company that you know invests in environmental projects.\" </p> <p> Robert Weston, founder of Groundswell, an ethical business consultancy, explains, \"Organisations approach us not only asking, 'How do we become more values driven?' but 'How can we be seen to be values-driven?' The second question comes from employers' knowledge that to sell their product and to attract the best recruits, they have got to have clear-cut values.\" </p> <p>Shell is one company that has had to work particularly hard at reassessing its approach following past controversies concerning the disposal of the Brent Spar oil platform and the company's activities in Nigeria. Last year, the company unveiled a new ethical advertising campaign - in part aimed at improving its image among prospective employees. \"We want to be seen as a company willing to confront these often difficult issues, not sweep them under the carpet,\" a company spokeswoman explains. </p> <p>Sue Jenkins, PR manager at Triodos - a Bristol-based bank which invests exclusively in organisations with social and environmental objectives - believes that after the greed-oriented 80s, there has been an inevitable move towards \"giving\". \"Most of our candidates now apply because of our values,\" she says. </p> <p>Jane de Bude, PA to the managing director at Triodos, is one such person. She left her last position as a legal secretary for a large solicitors' firm after she became disheartened by their lack of ethics. \"I work hard here,\" she admits. \"But I believe wholeheartedly in what I do. I feel I'm putting something back into society rather than just concentrating on how much money I - or my employers - make. It has made a huge difference to my level of job satisfaction.\" </p> <p>In the end, predicts Alex MacGillivray, deputy director of the New Economics Foundation, ethical issues will become so crucial in the recruitment process that instead of a bunch of well-known \"good\" companies, there will be a blacklist of notoriously \"bad\" ones. Few will want to be listed among the latter. Already, according to the IBE, 83 of the FTSE 100 companies have a code of business ethics. </p> <p>\u0095 Further information: <br>The Institute of Business Ethics: <a href=\"http://www.ibe.org.uk\">www.ibe.org.uk</a> 020-7798 6040;<br> Ethical Trading Initiative: <a href=\"http://www.ethicaltrade.org\">www.ethicaltrade.org</a> 020-7796 0515; <br>Voluntary Services Overseas: <a href=\"http://www.vso.org.uk\">www.vso.org.uk</a> 020-8780 7200; <br>Triodos: <a href=\"http://www.triodos.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.triodos.co.uk</a> 0500 008270</p>",
  "British firms are involved in the supply of barbaric torture equipment to Third World countries responsible for gross abuses of human rights, an Observer investigation can reveal. <p>The companies, which offered to help deliver leg irons, belly chains and hundreds of weapons, are flouting United Nations sanctions designed to prevent civilians being tortured. Known as 'brokers', they are exploiting loopholes in British laws which the Government has repeatedly promised to close. </p> <p>One Birmingham-based company, HPP, last week offered to help arrange delivery of leg irons and CS gas to a private security company in Rwanda, where ethnic tension between Hutu and Tutsi tribes is still simmering after up to a million people died in the 1994 genocide. </p> <p>In negotiations with an undercover reporter posing as a representative of a private company, HPP faxed a series of quotations for the consignment and said the equipment was to be flown to Rwanda by a Spanish-based company called Larrangua y Elorza. </p> <p>The total cost - for 35 hand-and-leg cuffs, 25 leg cuffs, 10 belly chains and 300 CS gas canisters - was \u00a31,720. HPP quoted the price in pesetas but indicated it would be happy for the goods to be paid for with a sterling cheque drawn on a British high street bank. </p> <p>The quotations, signed by Mary Barford, a director of HPP, offered delivery in two to three weeks. Asked about the company's activities, Barford said last week that her firm only passed the details of the deal to the Spanish company and denied any further involvement. 'It is just not our business. We don't sell anything like this. [Passing on the demands] is the sum total of our involvement.' </p> <p>Supplying CS gas to a private company in Rwanda - such as the one specified by The Observer's reporter - is a breach of UN sanctions prohibiting the delivery of weapons to anyone other than the government or peace-keeping forces in the war-torn central African state. The use of leg irons contravenes the UN's standard minimum rule for treatment of prisoners, passed more than 40 years ago. </p> <p>Belly chains are attached around the stomach like a belt. Handcuffs and legcuffs are attached to them, preventing movement of arms and legs. They can also be used for joining prisoners together. </p> <p>Shortly after coming to power in 1997, the Labour Government announced that anyone exporting leg irons would need licences. However, as with restrictions on the export of weapons, it is still easy for businesses based in the UK to arrange sales from points overseas. The Metropolitan Police had to drop a recent investigation into a businessman alleged to have sold electric shock batons to the Cypriot police. The Crown Prosecution Service ruled that, because the batons were bought in the United States, there was no case to answer, even though the deal was brokered in the UK. </p> <p>'Torture is an obscenity and it is appalling that loopholes in British law can allow companies based in this country to keep torturers supplied with the tools of their trade,' said a spokesman for Amnesty, the London-based human rights group. </p> <p>'Stories like this are a major embarrassment to the Government which, more than four years after the Scott Report [into arms to Iraq], is yet to introduce legislation to stop this disgusting trade.' The Government last week admitted it had dropped laws proposed in a recent White Paper from the parliamentary schedule for the next year. </p> <p>Both leg irons and CS gas have a terrible history in Rwanda. CS gas was used at least once by the Interahamwe Hutu militia to flush sheltering Tutsis out of buildings before hacking them to death. In the town of Kibuye thousands of Tutsis were killed as they fled a football stadium after gas canisters were thrown in. </p> <p>Leg irons have been used by military intelligence officers in Rwanda in the torture of prisoners. </p> <p>Larrangua y Elorza, which is based near Bilbao in northern Spain, boasts of having commercial relationships in dozens of countries worldwide. Data from Amnesty reveals that the company - which specialises in leg irons and handcuffs - is represented in at least seven countries, including Chile, Pakistan, Mexico, Thailand and Yemen, which have a record of misuse of 'restraint' devices. </p> <p>There are dozens of UK companies that have exploi-ted loopholes in UK legislation and continue 'brokering'. British Customs officers are investigating a series of air freight specialists in London and Gatwick who organise transport for arms shipments from eastern Europe to central and west Africa. </p> <p>Rwanda was the destinations for dozens of arms shipments brokered by British, French, South African and Bulgarian companies in the early Nineties. Many of these companies are still trading. </p> <p>The Government is under increasing pressure to close the loophole. Next week a motion at the Trades Union Congress will call for urgent legislation to curb the practice. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jason.burke@observer.co.uk\">jason.burke@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The wife of Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair yesterday picketed Downing Street in a bid to have her husband freed. But as Gina Adair protested, detectives revealed that they were probing the loyalist leader's financial affairs in a bid to keep him behind bars for as long as possible. <p>The Royal Ulster Constabulary's Financial Investigations Unit has been ordered to trace all of Adair's assets under the Proceeds of Crime Order. If the Shankill Road loyalist fails to explain where he got his newly-found wealth from, he would face further prosecution under the new legislation. </p> <p>The Ulster Defence Association's leader in loyalist west Belfast was re-arrested and put back in prison last month after Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State, judged that Adair had broken the terms of his early release last year from the Maze under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. </p> <p>Adair's wife picketed Downing Street along with several leading UDA members from its so-called London brigade. The UDA-aligned British Ulster Alliance claimed Adair was a 'political scapegoat' and that his re-arrest was internment by another name. </p> <p>A senior RUC officer said the force's Financial Investigation Unit was engaged in an 'assets tracing probe' over Adair's income and wealth. </p> <p>'We are looking at how he maintains his lifestyle, owns a big car, can go off on holidays to the Caribbean, and generally how he earns this money. The use of this legislation will be an increasing part of our fight against paramilitary-related crime in the next few years. The objective is to hit them where it hurts them most - in their pockets,' he said. </p> <p>The officer added that even if Adair was to be released by the Sentence Review Commission or win a judicial review which overturned Mandelson's decision, the RUC could amass enough evidence to put him back in jail or at the very least strip him of his wealth. </p> <p>Adair's UDA unit in the Lower Shankill area has been accused by the security forces and rival loyalists in the Ulster Volunteer Force of running the drugs trade in loyalist west and north Belfast. </p> <p>The UDA has countered by claiming that individual UVF commanders are also selling drugs. They also deny that Adair is motivated by profit pointing out that if he was, then he would not have courted publicity by standing with loyalists at Drumcree and challenging the UVF in its Shankill heartland. </p> <p>Members of the Lower Shankill UDA will also be investigated over their role in the loyalist feuding and general criminality in Belfast. It is understood that among those under investigation is a woman who took part in an armed show of strength in the Lower Shankill three weeks ago that sparked off the feud. She was captured on film in a balaclava and paramilitary uniform firing off an AK-47 rifle on the platform of a UDA rally that included the deputy Lord Mayor of Belfast, Councillor Frank McCoubrey. </p> <p>The weapons used in that display, the AK-47, a pistol and a sub-machine gun, were discovered in a flat during an RUC/Army search operation in the Lower Shankill last Thursday night. </p> <p>The security forces have also seized a number of weapons belonging to the UVF including a new Israeli-made Uzi sub-machine gun. An RUC forensic team found plastic wrapping around the Uzi which was abandoned in a street off the Crumlin Road during an aborted UVF attack on the UDA last week. </p> <p>According to the police, the plastic wrapping indicates the weapon was only recently smuggled into Northern Ireland. This confirms RUC fears that loyalist terrorists are still buying arms despite their ceasefires and their public commitment to the peace agreement. </p> <p>The loyalist feud, which has claimed three lives and caused more than 80 families to flee their homes in the Greater Shankill, shows no sign of ending. Talks were held on Friday night between the political representatives of the two warring paramilitary groups. The talks involving the Progressive Unionist Party's David Ervine and the Ulster Democratic Party leader Gary McMichael failed to bring the fighting to an end. </p> <p>A senior UVF commander told The Observer that progress in further talks would be 'very slow'. He said: 'There is no peace on the Shankill, this is not over by a long chalk.'</p>",
  "Tony Blair was in the top-floor flat of No 11 on Thursday 16 October 1997 when the phone began to ring, irritatingly. He had given instructions that he was not to be interrupted except in an emergency. A small nightmare already sat in front of him. Clare Short had embarrassed herself at the party conference in Brighton a fortnight earlier. Returning to the secure cordon around the conference area after an evening on the party circuit, the International Development Secretary had objected to being searched and had become involved in an emotional altercation with the security staff and the police. Had she been arrested, it would have been terrible for her and the Government. The worst had been averted: party officials intervened. The 'men in the dark' she once savaged were conducting an operation to keep this damaging story out of the newspapers. Blair was discussing with Short how she would handle herself if it did become public. <p>Then, the phone rang. At the other end of the line was Brown, anxious to resume an argument that had been flaring between them for much of the week. With fatiguing intensity, Brown was pressing to make a statement clarifying the Government's attitude towards the European single currency. Since the beginning of autumn, there had been mounting media speculation about a split between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. All of their argument was not re-rehearsed in this brief phone conversation. Distracted by Short and bludgeoned by Brown, Blair agreed to the Chancellor's plan to give a newspaper interview. 'But talk to Alastair first,' said Blair before putting down the phone. This five-minute call had consequences for Britain that would last for years. </p> <p>Brown kept his promise to ring Campbell and told him he would calm the speculation by fulfilling a long-standing request for an interview from Philip Webster, the political editor of the Times . On the assumption that Blair and Brown had reached an agreed position, and wrung out at the end of an exhausting week, Campbell agreed a text with Ed Balls, the Chancellor's economics adviser. Campbell, who does not appear to have discussed it further with Blair, would later confess that this was the scene of one of his greatest mistakes. </p> <p>The media, in common with most of the Cabinet, had presumed that this was a repeat of the drama, familiar from the Conservative years, of a Euro-enthusiastic Chancellor trying to drive a Euro-cautious Prime Minister towards the single currency. What this obscured was the role reversal between the two men. Blair, always temperamentally inclined to leave every option open, wanted to keep alive the possibility of entering the single currency before the election, at the very least as a signal to the rest of Europe of his good intent. But treating the euro as a political gesture was regarded as a nonsense by Brown who saw it as an issue of economics. A man compulsively inclined to close down debates he did not want to have, Brown wanted to shut off the option altogether. Not the least of the many extraordinary features of this episode is that the two most powerful men in government had not settled such a critical difference. </p> <p>Brown had been moving towards a view that the economies of Britain and the continent were not sufficiently synchronised to make early entry desirable or practical. He and Balls were horrified to discover how little preparatory work had been done at the Treasury. Brown brooded over the problem with Balls. If Britain could never be ready to join before the next election, the Government should say so clearly. Constant speculation about their intentions would be damaging, not least to Brown himself. A fixation with leading members of the Blair government was the fear of being stranded on the wrong side of an argument. Brown was not going to charge the guns of the Europhobic press while Blair observed the battle from a safe distance. Personal and economic calculation combined in the Chancellor's mind to produce the conclusion that he should unequivocally declare that Britain would not join the single currency before the next election. </p> <p>It was against this background that Webster of the Times was rung to be told that he had got his interview and was about 'to make history'. This was not an interview in the sense that an innocent newspaper reader might imagine, but a device that had become common practice between politicians with a message to get out and lobby correspondents eager for a story. The crucial passage about the single currency was provided to Webster by fax. It restated the Government's position with a sceptical flavour. </p> <p>The sensation was the headline that the Times printed over it: 'Brown rules out single currency for lifetime of this Parliament'. Though this was probably a little harder than had been intended by the Chancellor, it was the interpretation that Webster had been guided to put on his story during phone conversations with Brown, Balls and, most of all, Campbell who gave the journalist a very strong steer that the Government was ruling out the euro. This was also the line that Charlie Whelan, the Chancellor's devoted and roguish mouthpiece, spun out to other journalists. Brown wanted his change in policy trumpeted in a Europhobic tabloid. 'I'll get on to Higgy,' said Whelan. He suggested to the editor of the Sun that he should headline his version of the story: 'Brown Saves Pound'. Stuart Higgins would run a variation of that tune: 'Brown Says No to the Euro.' </p> <p>To spin such bold headlines over an ambiguous text on an issue of massive consequence was living dangerously. Not quite riskily enough, though, for Whelan. By the time other journalists were alert to the U-turn being announced in the Times , Whelan had repaired to the Red Lion pub to celebrate what he regarded as a great coup. He confirmed the story to BBC Newsnight and ITN. Two Liberal Democrat press officers observed Whelan repeatedly leaving the bar and shouting into his mobile phone: 'Yes, Gordon is ruling out British membership_ No, it doesn't say it in the interview, but Gordon is effectively ruling out joining in this parliament.' Rapidly the word spread that not only was the Government executing a massive change in policy, briefings on what Brown called 'the most important question the country is likely to face in a generation' were being conducted down a mobile phone from the pavement outside a pub. </p> <p>Someone haad been sliced out of the loop: Peter Mandelson. Knowing that he would fight the shift, Brown had left the self-styled 'Minister for Looking Ahead' blindsided. The first Mandelson knew about it was when Millbank faxed a copy of the front page of the Times to him at home in Hartlepool. A little after 10 o'clock, a palpitating Mandelson rang Chequers. Someone even more important had been left in the dark: Tony Blair. The Prime Minister had retired to his Buckinghamshire retreat on Friday evening, entirely oblivious to what was being perpetrated back in London. 'Did you authorise this?' asked Mandelson. 'I don't know,' replied Blair. 'What's going on?' Mandelson read from his faxed copy of the Times . What Brown had done was disastrous, he argued with Blair. Unequivocally ruling out entry would cause untold damage to Britain's relations with Europe and the Government's reputation among pro-European businesses. Now Blair began to fathom the magnitude of what was happening. He ended the call by telling Mandelson that he would immediately speak to the Chancellor. But Brown, who had disappeared to his Scottish constituency for the weekend, was incommunicado. Even the opera tors of the Downing Street switchboard, fabled for its ability to connect the Prime Minister to anyone in the world at any time of day or night, couldn't reach the Chancellor. Nor, even more remarkably, could Blair get hold of Campbell. He had all of his press secretary's phone numbers wired in his head. As he punched the phone, from none of them could the Prime Minister raise an answer. Campbell had gone missing just when Blair vitally needed him. Isolated at Chequers, marooned in the Chilterns, cut off from both Chancellor and press secretary, Tony Blair had one last desperate option. He phoned Char lie Whelan. The Prime Minister had been reduced to asking the man he never wanted in government what government policy was supposed to be tonight. When Blair came on the line, Whelan dived out of the bar of the Red Lion to find a discreet corner. </p> <p>'What the hell is all this stuff in the Times ?' Blair demanded. 'It's our policy,' replied an insouciant Whelan, still revelling in what he took to be a magnificent triumph. 'What's the problem? It's in the Times because it's our policy.' 'Who says it's our policy?' inquired a stunned Prime Minister. He had never authorised this. 'The headline - it's far too hard. You've got to row back.' 'Sorry, Tony,' replied Whelan. 'It's too late.' </p> <p>Had Blair turned on Newsnight , he would have seen the presenter also demanding to know what the hell was government policy on the single currency. Was it, as the official spokesmen for the Treasury were still insisting because Brown had left them in the dark as well, to keep the option open? Was it, as both Campbell and Whelan had been spinning, to rule out entry? The confusion extended to Britain's two most senior civil servants. On Saturday morning, the Cabinet Secretary rang the Treasury's Permanent Secretary. 'What on earth is going on, Terry?' asked Sir Robin Butler. 'I've no more idea than you, Robin,' Terry Burns had to admit. </p> <p>This was turning into an exhibition of New Labour's worst traits. Manoeuvring between its two leading men, exacerbated by the mutual loathing and paranoia of their entourages, and further aggravated by the Government's haphazard forms of decision-making, was creating mayhem in the most fundamental area of foreign and economic affairs. </p> <p>By Saturday morning, the media was savagely questioning the competence of the Government. 'That's done it,' Brown told Whelan. 'They'll crucify us for this.' Whelan offered to resign 'if it will help'. Brown instantly dismissed the idea: it would make him look weak. </p> <p>The spinners went into damage-limitation mode, and not entirely unsuccessfully. Some of the Sunday newspapers carried apparently authoritative reports that the new policy had been meticulously agreed by Blair and Brown the previous week when, in fact, the farrago had flowed from a five-minute phone call. This fiction had been manufactured by Whelan for the consumption of the media to try to dress up the chaos as a well-ordered decision. Campbell and Mandelson both knew this to be mendacious, but felt compelled to fall in with the deception. To do otherwise would be to expose the rupture between Prime Minister and Chancellor. </p> <p>There was a brittle conference call between Blair, Brown, Mandelson, Campbell, Balls and Whelan. Mandelson made plain that he thought they had blundered because they had failed to consult him. But there was not time for involved recriminations. Those would have to wait. It was agreed that the Chancellor would give interviews sticking to the opaque line that he would say no more than that the Government would be making a statement in due course. This was an attempt to put a straight face on this twisted farce. </p> <p>Monday's press was the worst for New Labour since it had come to office. The media tempest was accompanied by turbulent markets when the City opened for the new working week. By excruciatingly unfortunate timing, Brown was due to inaugurate the new electronic trading system at the Stock Exchange. As the Chancellor's gnawed finger activated the system, the screens behind him began to glow red. In 20 minutes \u00a320 billion was wiped off share values. </p> <p>Blair called the principal players together on Tuesday for a post-mortem. The two tribes lined up, Brown, Balls and Whelan on one side of the table; Blair, Mandelson, Campbell and Jonathan Powell on the other. Blair delivered an acidic commentary on the debacle of the previous 96 hours, finding it convenient to assign most culpability to the frictions between his entourage and the Chancellor's retinue. 'The feuding must end,' the Prime Minister declared. Though he rarely ventured even implicit criticism of his Chancellor in the presence of large numbers of witnesses, at one point Blair looked directly across at Brown: 'Everyone is to blame, Gordon, but you have chief responsibility for making sure that something like this never happens again. Our credibility is at stake.' </p> <p>Campbell, as complicit in the disaster as Whelan, was hardly in a position to demand, much as he might have liked to, that the other man be sacrificed. Mandelson was not so constrained. In the absence of the Brown team, Mandelson urged Blair to seize this opportunity to get the head of Whelan. 'We are all to blame,' sighed the Prime Minister. 'It wouldn't be fair.' 'Life's not fair,' snapped back Mandelson. 'Look,' said Blair. 'I'll get rid of him by Christmas.' Whelan had cast himself into the role of villain of this piece. The image of him - fag in mouth, drink in hand, mobile wedged into his neck, spinning economic policy from a pub - was indelibly burned into the episode. But Blair was right: to heap all the blame on a press officer would not be fair. Whelan was the Chancellor's creature following Brown's instructions. Whelan's methods were an application, albeit a crude one, from the New Labour textbook of spin. His most heinous sin against the New Labour commandments was to get caught. Campbell had been an accomplice to the briefings, and then went Awol at exactly the moment when Blair needed him. Brown was guilty of attempting a clumsily executed bounce on Blair who had failed to keep control of an area of policy so important to him. </p> <p>When Blair flew to Scotland for the Commonwealth Summit at the end of that week, still there was no policy. Mandelson was fighting to reverse Brown. Though unwilling to go that far, Blair was not ready to agree to closing off entry altogether. The Chancellor wanted the door slammed; the Prime Minister wanted it left ajar. Drafts of the statement banged back and forth between London and Edinburgh. Down from Scotland from the Prime Minister came his desired text which left the option of joining semi-open by qualifying Brown's policy of closing it off with the phrase 'barring a change in economic circumstances'. Back to Edinburgh went the Brownian version with that phrase removed. They played ping-pong. Each time Blair put the words in, Brown struck them out. </p> <p>Campbell, thinking an apology might draw some of the sting of the criticism, wrote an opening paragraph for Brown's speech expressing regret about the shambles. That Brown also flatly rejected. He was not going to admit failure. He declared he would use his statement to take 'the high ground'. With the negotiations deadlocked, Blair issued a nuclear threat. He told Brown he would make the statement to the Commons himself. Brown was fissile with fury, raging that this would undermine his authority as Chancellor and expose the division between them to the world. Brown did not know it, but he had an unfamiliar ally in Mandelson. 'It would be better,' he separately told Blair, 'to get Gordon to announce your policy.' There was some foundation to Brown's suspicions about being used by Blair. </p> <p>Eventually they ground out a compromise. Britain would not join the single currency before the next election 'barring some fundamental and unforeseen change in economic circumstances'. The door had been left open but only by a crack which time would turn into a victory for the Chancellor. </p> <p>Late on Friday afternoon, it was finally announced from the Treasury that the Chancellor would be making a statement to the Commons on the Monday. He framed his new policy within an overall intent to join the single currency at some point. 'We are the first British government to declare for the principle of monetary union, the first to state that there is no overriding constitutional bar to membership.' If the tests were met and the single currency proved 'successful' then 'Britain should be part of it'. Blair, sitting beside him, had been particularly insistent on this gloss. The new policy was announced as 'prepare and decide'. </p> <p>Euro-enthusiasts believed an opportunity had been missed. Roy Jenkins rang the Prime Minister that evening to tell him he had made a 'grave mistake'. Blair replied: 'Well, maybe.' </p> <p>His predicament over Europe, the conflict between strategy and tactics, the vacillation and indecision, was not over. The reckoning had only been delayed.</p> <p> \u00a9 2000 Andrew Rawnsley.

  "<p>The dentist in the Little Shop of Horrors may have sung about the joys of inflicting pain, but the truth could not be more different. Dentists are so depressed about patients who do not like them or complain about their sloppy work that they are losing sleep, skipping meals, becoming alcoholic and committing suicide. </p> <p>A study presented to the British Psychological Society has shown that most dentists are now severely demoralised because of a backlash from patients increasingly less willing to put up with second-rate work. </p> <p>Almost two-thirds of dentists said they were extremely stressed from having to cope with 'difficult or unco-operative' patients, with 44 per cent admitting that they suffered stress because of problems with 'dissatisfied' patients. </p> <p> The Observer recently revealed that more than 80 per cent of NHS dental work is sub-standard. There has been a sharp rise in the number of official complaints against dentists, and their medical negligence bills are spiralling. </p> <p>The stress is taking its toll on dentists' health. Almost 60 per cent of dentists feel tense and depressed, and more than half are suffering from headaches, indigestion, and feeling tired for no obvious reason. They also regularly suffer from vomiting, dizziness and not getting enough sleep. </p> <p>The study's author, Dr Lynn Myers of University College London, said: 'If they are high on stress, they are drinking more, smoking more, sleeping less and skipping breakfast. The more NHS work they do, the more stressed they are.' </p> <p>Another recent study showed that dentists have the second highest suicide rate of any profession. Last month a dentist in Bradford committed suicide, with work stress cited as the cause. </p> <p>The British Dental Association has set up a helpline for the large number of dentists who are turning to drink and drugs. BDA spokesman Anthony Kravitz said: 'Dentists are turning to drink or drugs because of stress - and it is usually work stress.' </p> <p>Most dentists also complain they are stressed because of the NHS payments system, which pays them to deal with as high a number of patients as quickly as possible. Dentists usually set aside just six minutes for a check-up. The survey showed that most dentists admitted they saw more patients than they wanted to in order to boost their incomes. Privately, many admit that they get depressed by always doing second-rate work. </p> <p>One dentist in the north of England told The Observer: 'I stopped doing NHS work so I could sleep at night - I now just do private so I can spend more time on it, and live with a clean conscience.' </p> <p>The survey also shows that dentists find it difficult to deal with patients anxious about feeling pain. David Cocker, a dentist in Tunbridge Wells who has also virtually given up NHS work, said: 'If the patient is very nervous, it transfers to the dentist. With a very nervous patient, I feel it twice over.' </p> <p>Dentists - looked down upon by the rest of the medical profession and often stereotyped as sadists - almost always use the title 'doctor' in order to gain prestige, even though virtually none of them actually have a doctorate. </p> <p>The Advertising Standards Authority recently banned dentists from using the title in adverts, slamming it as misleading. </p> <p>Health officials are now concerned about the large numbers of young dentists who are simply leaving the profession. </p> <p>One dentist, who quit eight years after qualifying to train as a teacher, said: 'It's a disgusting job looking inside people's rotting mouths all day, there's no real social interaction, and everyone hates you.'</p>",
  "Late on the Sunday afternoon after the election, Gordon Brown left his new domain at the Treasury to be driven to the Blairs' home in Richmond Crescent. Stepping through the clutter of cases, crates and boxes of a family preparing to move, they talked together in the front room, the location of so many of their internal debates in Opposition. The difference now was that their words could be made into the flesh of change. They were the two most powerful men in Britain. From the street outside came the chatter of police radios. <p>The Chancellor had come to get a decision from the Prime Minister about handing control over interest rates to the Bank of England. This audacious stroke had been the subject of conversations between the two men for some time. Brown had decided that he wanted to announce Bank independence immediately they came to power, but he had deliberately waited until polling day to bounce that element of the plan on Blair.</p> <p> This was partly tactics: it would give Blair little time to consult others who might be cool about the idea. It was partly temperament. Brown dealt with issues by brooding, alone or within his tight ring of trustees, before crashing his decision on colleagues. Blair circled and circled around subjects, like a plane endlessly orbiting a runway, more often casting widely for advice, before descending on a conclusion. While warm to the boldness of the Bank plan in principle, and enthused by the political dividend of winning the City's instant approval, Blair had mildly irritated Brown by not going snap at once. </p> <p>Brown urged: 'If we're going to do it, we've got to do it immediately.' To postpone would expose them to the accusation that they had been forced into it because they weren't competent to run the economy. Brown showed Blair the letter he proposed to give to the Bank's Governor, the product of a frenzied weekend of work at the Treasury. When Blair agreed to Brown's plan to make the announcement that Tuesday, the Chancellor departed a satisfied man. </p> <p>It was a beaming Eddie George who emerged from his audience at the Treasury with Gordon Brown on Bank Holiday Monday. He told Brown he was 'delighted' with this 'wonderful news'. This was a 'historic moment' for the Bank to which George had been devoted all his working life. But his joy was not unconfined. The Chancellor had also revealed to George an intention to examine the Bank's powers of supervision over financial institutions and the management of government debt. </p> <p>George sought from Brown a promise that he would have the opportunity 'to argue the Bank's case' before a decision was made. The Governor left the meeting with a second letter, not to be published on Bank independence day, containing guarantees from Brown of consultation. Anxious to make sense of this extraordinary event, the Governor sought out his old friend at the Treasury, the Permanent Secretary, Sir Terry Burns. Burns reassured him that nothing was likely to happen about the Bank's other powers in the near future. </p> <p>Both men were seriously misreading the nature of the new Chancellor, and neither had grasped Brown's hidden agenda concerning them both. 'Gordon wanted an independent Bank of England,' says another senior Minister. 'But he didn't want a Governor independent of Gordon Brown.' </p> <p>The Chancellor, possessed of an almost pathological urge to be in control of everything and everyone around him, had long before determined to be rid of Eddie George, the stout, chain-smoking incumbent at Threadneedle Street. Ed Balls, Brown's economic adviser, had been at a pre-election lunch in the Commons at which George had been fiercely critical of Kenneth Clarke's reluctance to raise interest rates. When this was reported back to him, Brown hardened in his conviction against George. 'If he attacks a Tory Chancellor like that, what's he going to do to us?' </p> <p>Blair was aware of Brown's animosity, though not attuned to the scale and determination of it. When the Governor again angered Brown by criticising aspects of his policies in a pre-election interview, Blair dispatched Peter Mandelson to give George a private friendly warning about the perils of provoking the wrath of Brown. </p> <p>'Eddie has to go,' Brown would fume, and he wanted Burns gone with him. A monetarist appointee of Thatcherite vintage, Burns was politically, economically and temperamentally uncongenial to Brown. The Chancellor and his acolytes would refer to the Governor and Permanent Secretary as 'The Manchester Mafia'. A third man in their sights was an alumnus of Manchester Grammar School, the deputy at the Bank, Howard Davies. In his previous incarnation as director-general of the CBI, Davies had sharply attacked some of Brown's policies, criticism which had never been forgotten by the new Chancellor, a man with an elephantine capacity for remembering slights. </p> <p>The moment of combustion was delayed while the covert preparations for the Bank announcement were completed. On Tuesday, 6 May, at a press conference the like of which had never before been organised at the Treasury, Brown revealed his 'revolution at the Bank'. The Prime Minister was not over-guilty of hyperbole when he described it as 'the biggest step in economic policy-making since World War II'. The City celebrated with spree-buying of shares, gilts and sterling. The FT-SE 100 soared to a new record, and the pound reached its highest level against the mark since sterling's ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. </p> <p>Brown was ominously silent about whether George would be reappointed as Governor when his term expired in 1998. As for the plan to strip the Bank of its supervisory powers, that remained a secret to a tiny number within Whitehall. </p> <p>A fortnight after their first meeting, Brown summoned George for another audience. The surprise he now sprang on the Governor was an entirely unwelcome one. As they sat facing each other in his study at No 11, Brown told a pole-axed George that the following day he would be announcing to MPs his plan to transfer the Bank's supervisory powers over financial institutions to a Securities and Investment Board. The Chancellor had already settled on a chief for this 'super-SIB', as it would become known. The job had already been accepted by Howard Davies. As a former head of the Audit Commission, among other qualifications, he had the right pedigree. His CV wasn't Brown's paramount consideration. By appointing Davies, Brown would remove one of the Manchester Mafia from the Bank, and George would be deprived of an ally in resisting the Chancellor. </p> <p>Brown had good cause. A series of scandals had undermined confidence in the Bank's regulatory abilities. His presentation of this to George as a fait accompli was, however, brusque to the point of brutality. The Governor listened with reddening rage. George, a bridge-player, felt that Brown had been dealing from the bottom of the deck. The promises of consultation had been broken. He had been deceived. This, he told Brown, was 'a betrayal, an intolerable betrayal'. </p> <p>As he was driven back to the City, George concluded that his position was untenable. He rang his private office back at the Bank. Between lungfuls of Rothmans cigarettes, he began to dictate a letter of resignation. By the time his car had returned him to Threadneedle Street, George was still boiling, but the temperature of his anger had dropped sufficiently for him to discuss what he should do with senior colleagues at the Bank, and his ally at the Treasury, Sir Terry Burns. </p> <p>Burns urged George not to take a knife to his veins until he had raised the alarm with Sir Robin Butler at No 10. The news that Eddie George had been driven to the brink of resignation was rapidly conveyed to the Prime Minister. 'Jesus,' gasped Blair. 'What has Gordon done?' The resignation of the Governor of the Bank of England, barely a fortnight into the Government's life, would ignite precisely the crisis with the City that he and Brown were supposed to be dedicated to avoiding at any cost. This would be catastrophic, thought Blair. </p> <p>He got hold of the Chancellor. He said: 'There will have to be a negotiation, Gordon.' The Prime Minister also made a personal call to George and - as one witness to this episode puts it - 'poured some balm on his wounds'. </p> <p>Brown never reacted well to being thwarted. This displeasure he expressed by delegating the task of the detailed bargaining with George to his deputy, the Chief Treasury Secretary, Alistair Darling. With Burns acting as the go-between, a concordat would eventually be negotiated which left the Bank with sufficient responsibilities for the overall stability of the financial system to satisfy Eddie George's honour and save his face at the Bank. </p> <p>George attempted to play down rumours that he had been close to resignation. 'All sorts of things go through your mind,' he replied to a question about it, but the thought of resigning 'went away very quickly'. For 'Steady Eddie' even to hint that he had been wobbling was enough to send a tremor through the markets. </p> <p>Was this simply an exhibition of Brown's insensitive approach to relationships? Or had the Chancellor deliberately set out to provoke into resignation a Governor he wanted to be rid of? There is no question, according to one confidant of Brown, that had George gone through with his resignation 'Gordon would have jumped at it'. At the time, one anonymous ministerial associate gloated that the Governor had 'played into our hands'. </p> <p>When Darling presented the agreement he had come to with George for Brown's inspection, the Chancellor indicated his continuing fury by approving it with little more than a grunt. He was redoubled in his determination to prise out both the Governor and the Permanent Secretary. A campaign of destabilisation was under way against Eddie George. Candidates to replace him were regularly floated in the newspapers. After several representations were made to the Prime Minister, Tony Blair finally confronted his Chancellor about the briefings against Eddie George and told him to put a stop to the campaign of poisoned whispers.</p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Andrew Rawnsley.

  "Mo Mowlam, the darling of all but the senior members of her own political party, is to lay bare her pet hates in a television show on Friday night. <p>The former Northern Ireland Secretary is the guest of comedian Paul Merton in BBC2's Room 101, in which she will confess her loathing for lawyers. </p> <p>The entire legal profession, represented by a model of a shark, is number two on her list of items selected for annihilation. </p> <p>Avoiding any reference to the fact that Tony Blair and his wife are both trained barristers, Mowlam argues that lawyers should be wiped off the face of the planet,and complains most of them think they rule it. 'They are difficult, arrogant, self-opinionated and they earn too much money,' she tells Merton. </p> <p>The Cabinet Minister, who announced last week that she is to step down from parliament at the next general election, adds that the worst types of lawyers tend to have gone to both Eton and Oxford, where they quickly pick up 'a degree of confidence' that other people have to learn later through hard graft in the real world. </p> <p>Mowlam also consigns Clause 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act to the fiery furnace. Arguing strongly for the repeal of Conservative legislation that banned the 'promotion' of homosexuality in schools, she indicates that the issue is one which she will continue to campaign about. </p> <p>She claims there is no reason why young people should not be offered full information on homosexuality and on sexuality generally. 'People are what they are. Nobody can tell you that you have to be one way or the other. People should have the right to learn for themselves what they are.' Mowlam, MP for Redcar, was recently chosen to welcome publicly the gay Conservative businessman Ivan Massow over to the Labour Party. </p> <p>She also rails against no smoking signs which, she says, are an infringement of civil liberties. Although she has given up the habit since her treatment for a brain tumour, she confesses that she still enjoys the 'odd passive moment'. </p> <p>In a return to childhood passions, Mowlam speaks of her dislike of cooked apple and of the 'green slime' found on open-air statues. </p> <p>As a schoolgirl in Coventry, the young Mo and her friends made news in the local paper by volunteering to clean the verdigris from the municipal statue of the nude Lady Godiva. </p> <p>Golf is also savaged by Mowlam, but the first choice for her personal Room 101 is the wig that she wore for six months during her chemotherapy treatment. She says she had two identical wigs, one of which she has auctioned off for charity. </p> <p>She denies that she ever took it off during negotiations to gain political advantage. 'I just took it off when I was hot, although that may sometimes have coincided with difficult moments,' she says.</p>",
  "British soldiers trying to free hostages in Sierra Leone are suffering nightmares and hallucinations linked to a powerful anti-malaria pill blamed for causing permanent brain damage. <p>Mefloquine, which is given to tourists and travellers under the name Lariam, has been prescribed to members of the Parachute Regiment in the war-torn West African state, even though other international forces have banned its use after troops went on the rampage and tortured local people. </p> <p>Some medical experts believe the drug can cause heartbeat abnormalities, mood disturbances, hallucinations and convulsions. </p> <p>An Army source told The Observer that some British soldiers serving in Sierra Leone were suffering nightmares and that many disliked taking the pill. Three months ago Lance Corporal Kristian Shelmerdine of the Parachute Regiment shot himself in the arm in an accident he claimed was triggered by the drug. He said he could remember nothing about the shooting apart from experiencing vivid dreams and waking with a bullet wound. An Army investigation found him guilty of negligent discharge, but at least one Army doctor thinks mefloquine could be responsible. </p> <p>There have been other cases involving British troops and Lariam in recent years. Former paratrooper Steve Pratt was given a war pension after suffering adverse reactions to the drug, and Sergeant Colin Murray of the Royal Engineers blamed mefloquine for an incident in Nairobi, Kenya, when he bit off the nose of a colleague in a bar-room brawl. Murray was initially court-martialled, but the case was later dismissed at appeal on technical grounds. </p> <p>'The potential side-effects from mefloquine are of serious concern. There are alternatives that do not carry the same degree of risk,' said Jeanne Less of Lariam Action USA, a group co-ordinating legal suits filed against the drug in the US. </p> <p>Roche, the Swiss manufacturer, says all drugs have some form of side-effects and that mefloquine has been stringently tested. It is extremely effective against malaria, and the company points out that serious side-effects are rare. </p> <p>Wing-Commander Andy Green, an Army expert on malaria, said any soldiers reacting to the drug would be taken off it, but it was still the best preventative. </p> <p>Australian peacekeepers in East Timor take doxycyline, which is also effective against malaria and has fewer side-effects. But it requires daily use, unlike mefloquine, which is taken once a week. </p> <p>Mefloquine was at the centre of an inquiry into the behaviour of Canadian peacekeepers in Somalia in 1993 after they beat, tortured and shot Somalis. An inquiry concluded that mefloquine 'could have been a factor in the behaviour of some troops'. </p> <p>Despite such incidents, many experts in Britain believe the small risk of taking the drug is far outweighed by the potentially lethal chance of contracting malaria. There are an estimated 100 million cases of malaria annually and it is responsible for more than two million deaths a year. </p> <p>In Britain, Lariam is still prescribed by many doctors for anyone travelling into a malaria area. Joanna Hensler, 32, who took the drug before a trip to Kenya in 1996 believes it has almost destroyed her life. She developed dizziness, insomnia and eventually became paranoid and suicidal. </p> <p>'I am certain it was Lariam,' she said. 'I took the pill at night and woke up feeling confused and numb. From then on my life changed.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:paul.harris@observer.co.uk\">paul.harris@observer.co.uk </a></p>",
  "It had become a persistent theme of media commentary that, in New Labour plc, Blair was the chairman and Brown the chief executive. The Prime Minister giddied around the globe from summit to summit; the Chancellor was the colossus who bestrode the peaks at home. The implication was that while the Prime Minister was the grinning, travelling salesman of the Government, the man of substance and action was the Chancellor. <p>Blair was initially sanguine about all this. To one aide who worried that the Chancellor was becoming over-mighty, Blair expressed himself unbothered: 'When I sit in the garden of Chequers, and the sun is on my face, I know who is the Prime Minister.' Others around nagged him about the markedly more comradely noises in Brown's speeches which seemed designed to pitch himself to Labour MPs as a more radical substitute for Blair. The Prime Minister again appeared unfazed. 'If Gordon uses a bit of left-wing rhetoric, so what? It keeps the party happy.' </p> <p>A civil servant remarked to Blair that when Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson were together it was like 'watching two strangers talking'. Blair replied that his relationship with his Chancellor was like 'a marriage'. </p> <p>Lurking in the recesses of any argument between Prime Minister and Chancellor was Brown's belief that he had been the making of Blair. The Prime Minister couldn't entirely subscribe to that, but he did acknowledge his debts to Brown. 'It's always there when Gordon is arguing with Tony - \"you owe me\" - even if it's not very often expressed,' says a Cabinet Minister. </p> <p>Officials marvelled as they were also shocked at the open disdain with which Brown would sometimes treat Blair. Aides and colleagues remarked upon the extraordinary efforts Blair devoted to managing Brown. 'He mediates, he negotiates, he defuses, he cajoles, he rails, he shouts, he hugs, he flatters,' said a close observer of the relationship. </p> <p>The 'normality' of Blair was an act, but it was more than a performance. It was his self-conceit that 'I do not think of myself as a politician'. Of course, he was a politician, a most extraordinary politician. What he meant was that he had not been born and bred by the machine; his every breath was not politics. The same was not true of Brown, a man consumed by the political since an early age. 'Gordon's problem is that he hasn't got a family,' Blair told one confidant, which he also believed to be the central explanation for what was wrong with Peter Mandelson. </p> <p>Blair thought that he had a unique capacity for dealing with his turbulent and talented friends. Ministers, aides and civil servants who brought him complaints about the Chancellor's uncollegiate behaviour were told by Blair: 'I can handle Gordon,' in the manner of a psychotherapist talking about a brilliant but temperamental child. </p> <p>Gordon went through 'unco-operative' stretches, the Prime Minister explained to one close friend, but 'he always comes back in the end'. A senior civil servant who has observed them at close quarters confirms: 'It is like a marriage, a tempestuous marriage. The rows can be terrible. But if you're on the outside and you interfere, you won't be thanked for it afterwards. You come between them at your peril. When it comes to make-up time, everyone else is to blame, rather than they themselves. </p> <p>By the New Year of 1998, the marriage was increasingly strained by stretches of crockery-throwing. Blair's ambition to turn No 10 into the corporate headquarters of his government had been frustrated. While his energies were dissipated, the design to turn the Cabinet Office into a Department of the Prime Minister, imposing his writ across Whitehall, was not realised. Brown saw the vacuum and rushed to impose himself in it. The Chancellor's comprehensive spending review was an opportunity to delve deep into every department which he further exploited by binding Ministers to his will through 'public service agreements' with the Treasury. The good reason for this - ensuring that money was efficiently spent - was allied to a manipulative motive. It was an attempt to make the rest of the Cabinet agree to serve the Treasury. </p> <p>Regular, and from a variety of Ministers, were the protests to Blair that Brown's idea of consultation was to pick up the phone and bark his decisions at them. David Blunkett complained that Brown would block his ideas and then repackage them as the Chancellor's own under the New Deal label. 'Blunkett would go bananas,' says a civil servant. So provoked was Blunkett by Brown on one occasion that the Education Secretary stormed from his ministerial suite shouting 'the mendacious sod', demanded his car, and told the driver to take him straight round to Blair. His alarmed officials rang No 10 to warn them of the imminent arrival of an incendiary Secretary of State. </p> <p>Blair began to tire of dousing colleagues inflamed by Brown. Expressions of his exasperation with the Chancellor became more frequent. 'Jesus,' Blair despaired to officials and aides. 'What has Gordon done now?' </p> <p>At moments of extreme exasperation, Blair would cry: 'God! Gordon can be impossible.' The surface tension manifested itself in increasingly demented infighting between the rival entourages at Downing Street and the Treasury. Alastair Campbell made time in his frantic schedule to compile a bulging file of cuttings of newspaper stories inspired, or so he believed, by Charlie Whelan to promote the Chancellor at the expense of the rest of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister. </p> <p>The relationship was so fissiparous that something as apparently innocuous as a friendly biography of Brown provoked mounting agitation at No 10. In early January, Campbell demanded of Whelan that he let him have a pre-publication copy of Paul Routledge's life of Gordon Brown. Campbell called him a liar and smashed down the phone when Whelan replied that he couldn't, because he had lent the only copy in his possession to John Brown, the Chancellor's older brother. It was long beyond the point of mattering whether or not Whelan was telling the truth: he probably was in this case. The relationship between him and Campbell had collapsed. </p> <p>This grudge match between the spinners was amplification and aggravation of the stress lines between Prime Minister and Chancellor. It also served as a proxy for the battle for ascendancy between them. It suited both Blair and Brown to pretend to each other, even to themselves, that vicious briefing by their rival coteries was not of their making. Whelan's excesses occasionally made Brown wince; some of Campbell's activities caused Blair to flinch. Yet both gun dogs were broadly following their masters' wishes. Otherwise, they would have been muzzled or put down. On one of the many occasions when Mandelson demanded of the Prime Minister that he force the Chancellor to dispose of Whelan, Blair replied: 'How can I sack Charlie when he's only doing what Gordon's telling him to do?' </p> <p>The biography of Brown - written with 'his full co-operation' - was an admiring account of a man about whom there was much to admire. Routledge accurately depicted the Chancellor as a man scarred by the way in which he had been denied the crown by Blair. Picking the scab off this wound presented Brown, a picture that was not as kindly as the biographer intended, as a man eaten by past wrongs. Calculated to infuriate Blair was the book's tendentious suggestion that he was a cheat and a charlatan who broke a blood promise to his oldest political ally and robbed of his birthright the man who was supposed to be his closest friend. </p> <p>The nature of the Blair-Brown relationship was a subject I thought worth exploring in my column for The Observer. Of many conversations I had that week, the most significant was with a person I described at the time as 'someone who has an extremely good claim to know the mind of the Prime Minister'. I would describe them that way today. </p> <p>For the first five minutes of a long conversation with this person, I was spun the familiar line that no political coupling was more blissful than that between Blair and Brown. The Prime Minister esteemed the Chancellor as 'a great talent' and 'a great force'. But, after a little prodding, an entirely different account began to tumble out. Brown's self-promoting biography was 'a classic piece of misjudgment'. The Government could not afford 'any more lapses into this sort of nonsense'. </p> <p>Why, I wondered, did Brown behave like this? 'You know Gordon, he feels so vulnerable and so insecure. He has these psychological flaws.' Warming to the theme, the other person poured out a litany of complaint about how all the Government's afflictions had been caused by the Treasury. 'If you go through the real disasters of our time in government - EMU, the Geoffrey Robinson affair, ISAs, single parents - I'm afraid there is a common thread to them all. They are coming out of the Treasury.' This was not entirely just: chief responsibility for the Ecclestone Affair lay at the door of No 10. The complaint continued: 'What Gordon has done is cut out the civil service, and that just leads to trouble.' Blair was obliged to take control of the committee on welfare because other members of the Cabinet 'just don't trust Gordon. There's so much venom against him.' </p> <p>The highlights of the insight this offered into the nature of the relationship between Prime Minister and Chancellor formed the basis of the column I wrote that weekend. The vivid phrase 'psychological flaws' was projected on to the front page of The Observer. There was a media excitement. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson spoke truthfully when he denied authorship of 'psychological flaws'. Many, though, thought they heard the voice of Mandelson, who had been depicted as a treacherous Iago in the Brown biography, speaking later that Sunday. It was reported by a BBC political correspondent on Radio 4's main evening news that 'close allies of the Prime Minister are furious at the Chancellor for, as they see it, reopening old wounds'. The reporter continued that 'some have warned' that while the Chancellor is in a very strong position 'that may not last for ever, and nobody is indispensable'. The reporter was Lance Price, known to be close to Mandelson, who would succeed Tim Allan as a press spokesman at No 10. </p> <p>Monday's newspapers seized on this startling evidence that the friction between the Treasury and Downing Street was much more inflamed than had hitherto been appreciated. The Mirror had 'Britain's two most powerful men at war'. Labour MPs, the more innocent of whom had swallowed the line that it was always harmony and sweetness between the neighbours of Downing Street, reacted with shock. </p> <p>In an attempt to smother the flames, an over-protesting Alastair Campbell declared on the Prime Minister's behalf that he regarded Brown as 'an extremely excellent Chancellor'. Brown, who happened to be in Brussels, made a professional job of publicly shrugging it all off as 'essentially rumour, gossip and tittle-tattle'. He was masking a profound hurt. He smarted at the attack, partly perhaps because this complex man could recognise some of himself in the description of his vulnerabilities and insecurities even as he was understandably insulted that they were labelled 'psychological flaws'.</p> <p> On Brown's return to London, there was a clench-jawed confrontation with the Prime Minister. Brown dressed his anger in a concern for the standing of the Government. It was 'destabilising', Brown complained to Blair, as well as being 'unfair' to him personally. 'This damages me and you,' Brown thundered at Blair. 'Why are you letting this go unpunished?' Brown's desire for retribution was thwarted because Blair could not - or would not - tell him who was responsible. 'I can't believe it was anyone here,' responded Blair. Brown thought Blair was lying. </p> <p>Blair was apologetic that things had got so out of hand, but he had his own grievances. He told Brown he had brought this on himself with 'that bloody stupid book'. How long had he been warning him that Brown would be the one damaged by 'the Whelan operation'? Brown came to the opposite conclusion. This episode confirmed to him how important it was to retain the services of Whelan as the bodyguard of his reputation against No 10, and as the instrument of his retaliation. </p> <p>Brown possessed a valuable weapon - information - which he used to disadvantage Blair. The Chancellor was always confident of winning an argument about economics with the Prime Minister, much the less confident in the area of the pair, so long as Blair did not have independent sources of advice. Brown decreed to the Treasury that the Number 10 Policy Unit, including Blair's personal adviser on economics, was not to be supplied with information about the March 1998 Budget. Brown was again keen to sweep away tax breaks that he regarded as illogical and redundant such as mortgage tax relief. 'Is this wise, Gordon?' Blair would ask, a favoured formulation for framing his worries about something proposed by Brown. </p> <p>Among his own intimates, Brown took to saying: 'Tony is the master of wise politics' in a voice that hovered over being a compliment before descending into sarcasm. Brown had a premonition of what to expect in the summer reshuffle because he had been shut out of the debates within Downing Street. By four o'clock on the last Sunday in July, all of the Prime Minister's key aides were safely and secretly gathered inside No 10. There were no cameras to watch them arrive: Alastair Campbell had artfully misled the media that Tony Blair was spending the weekend at Chequers. Sally Morgan, the head of the Political Office, had a little list: Ministers who were camp followers of the Chancellor. They were marked for execution. 'How will he take it?' Blair worried out loud. No one expected the Chancellor to take it well; all agreed that it had to be done. According to one of the aides in the room that afternoon: 'It was Blair versus Brown. Blair had to win.' </p> <p>At any rate, he had to be seen to win. As the reshuffle was announced, it became evident that Blair was carpet-bombing the network of supporters Brown had placed in government. It was designed to establish who wore the trousers in Blair's 'marriage' to Brown. There was talk from No 10 of a more 'formal' style of decision-making. </p> <p>Chairing his first co-ordination meeting at No 10, the new Cabinet 'Enforcer', Jack Cunningham, looked around at Campbell and Whelan. He made a display of taking charge. He thumped the table: 'The feuding must stop!' The feuding would last much longer than Doctor Jack. </p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Andrew Rawnsley.

  "American officials in Kosovo are being accused of interfering with an investigation into a senior Kosovo Albanian politician implicated in murder, drug-trafficking and war crimes. <p>Ramush Haradinaj, a former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), was the key US military and intelligence asset in Kosovo during the civil war and the Nato bombing campaign that followed. </p> <p>In the latest twist in the saga of an increasingly flawed electoral process, United Nations police in the province complain that US personnel withheld evidence about a gunfight involving Haradinaj, who is now head of one of the province's leading political groups. </p> <p>UN investigators leading the case say US officials based at their main base, Camp Bondsteel, removed forensic evidence from the scene of the gun battle, including bullets retrieved from walls. The incident, which took place in the village of Strellc in the west of Kosovo, is well out of the US Army's area of responsibility, which lies in the south-east of the province. </p> <p>Following the shooting Haradinaj, known almost universally in the province as simply Ramush, was flown by helicopter to Camp Bondsteel and then onto Germany to be treated in an US Army hospital for shrapnel wounds. UN investigators were denied access to him during that time. </p> <p>Evidence from the incident was eventually handed over after angry phone calls from Fred Pascoe, the American policeman heading the UN investigation. </p> <p>The news of American reluctance to co-operate with the investigation comes amid a catalogue of accusations linking Haradinaj to murder, drugs trafficking and war crimes. </p> <p>The shooting revolved around a dispute between Haradinaj and members of the Musaj family, who accuse him of ordering the murder of their brother and three other men shortly after the arrival of Nato troops in Kosovo in June 1999. The men were all part of FARK (Armed Force of the Republic of Kosovo ), a rival group to the Kosovo Liberation Army. </p> <p>Three Musaj brothers had visited Haradinaj's father to demand the bones of their brother, a right they had according to Albanian custom. Haradinaj admits he went to the Musaj family home at around one in the morning to stop the brothers from visiting his father again. </p> <p>This is the second time this year Haradinaj has been caught up in violence. He was injured in a fight with Russian soldiers at a K-For checkpoint in the spring. Western diplomats say he has damaged his party's prospects in UN-organised local elections due this October. </p> <p>This latest incident does not appear to have damaged his contacts with US military or political figures. </p> <p>His party officials were invited to a discussion on the future of Kosovo at a meeting organised by the US state department. He himself is currently in Washington on a fund-raising trip and as the guest of a US Congressman, Benjamin Gillman. </p> <p>His standing with the international community is summed up by British officials who describe him as 'one of the few former commanders of the KLA who can deliver'. They say he was crucial in smoothing over the transition of the KLA from a guerrilla army to a civilian-based national guard. </p> <p>But British military personnel who liaised with Haradinaj before and during the Nato bombing campaign paint a different picture. One former soldier, who served with the Kosovo Verification Mission, described him as 'a psychopath' and accused him of terrorising his own men and the local population into loyalty to him. 'He would beat his own men to maintain a kind of military discipline,' he said. </p> <p>'Someone would pass him some information and he would disappear for two hours. The end result would be several bodies in a ditch,' he added </p> <p>The man said he was also present when Ramush 'went to deal with' an Albanian family who had let Serb police into their house. The incident matches a human rights report issued by the OSCE (Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe) last year in which seven masked men entered a house in the village of Gornja Lucka. Two men were beaten and a third was taken to a nearby canal and never seen again. </p> <p>During this time the same former soldier says Haradinaj was maintaining daily contact with American military personnel in the US and that these links were then taken over by Nato at the beginning of the bombing campaign in Kosovo. </p> <p>Another alleged victim of Ramush's men was Suad Qorraj, who had operated a satellite telephone for a rival KLA commander during the war. His family say he went missing from the town of Decani on 23 June 1999, two weeks after the end of the war. On 1 August Suad's charred remains were found in a nearby forest. The burial notice said he had been 'killed by Serbs'. </p> <p>A year on from Suad's death, Haradinaj still wields considerable power in western Kosovo. 'He can very easily bring the area to a halt,' says Robert Charmbury, UN administrator of the biggest town in the region, Pec, citing as evidence the fight against Russian peace keepers in which the town was 'blockaded in minutes'. </p> <p>The Alliance party has strong representation on local municipal boards and is discussing the possibility of a pact with the Kosovan Democratic Party (PDK), led by Hashim Thaci, former political leader of the KLA. Such a deal might squeeze out the favourites to win in the region, the Democratic League of Kosovo, in October's elections. </p> <p>Whatever the outcome of the polls, senior UN officials are concerned about Haradinaj's long-term impact on the province. One aide claims Haradinaj is now financed by two men, Naser Kelmendi and Ekrem Lluka, both of whom are suspected to be involved in smuggling. UN police reports, seen by The Observer, go further and describe Lluka as trafficking drugs and cigarettes in Greece, Kosovo, Albania and Italy. </p> <p>Meanwhile the Musaj brothers are worried about what Haradinaj will do in the next few weeks. 'If he doesn't attack us before the elections he'll attack us afterwards,' said Sadic Musaj. He and his brother have already built up the walls around their compound in case of another attack. He doubts however whether anybody will take action against Ramush. 'Nothing will happen, he has strong people behind him.'</p>",
  "The Fergana Valley, where the borders of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan meet, has become the scene of a ferocious holy war. The worsening conflict may lead to the first deployment of Russian troops in the area since the fall of the Soviet Union. The region has become a bloody battleground for rebel guerrillas, believed to be members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, who aim to overthrow Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov, impose sharia law, and carve out an Islamic state. <p>Regional governments have accused the Taliban and Osama bin Laden of training and bankrolling the guerillas. The Taliban deny giving the rebels anything but moral support. Iran has also been implicated in the funding of the crusade. </p> <p>In the past month conflict has escalated as Kyrgyz, Uzbek and Tajik troops try to clamp down on the insurgents. The governments of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, concerned about the destabilising effects of the rebellion, have formed an anti-terrorist alliance. However, all three former Soviet states are impoverished and may not be able to rely on their own armies. </p> <p>Moscow has agreed in principle to help, but there are no details on the type of military operation they have in mind. Numbering less than 1,000-2,000, the rebels use rugged mountain terrain to their advantage in outrunning and ambushing their enemies. At least 20 government soldiers and 40 rebels were killed in fierce battles last month.</p>",
  "The beleaguered Dome supremo, Lord Falconer, came under fresh fire last night after he was accused of exacerbating financial problems at the struggling Greenwich building by ignoring earlier demands for cash handouts which would have helped contain its spiralling debt problems. <p>Further question marks were also raised over why the Dome Minister failed to ask what the board of the New Millennium Experience Company intended to do to avert the crisis, despite the fact he was fully aware of its problems. </p> <p>Sources close to the NMEC said that last year, before the building was even open, they discussed seeking more cash when it became clear advance ticket sales were low, but were warned off by Falconer. </p> <p>News of the poor advance sales shocked Dome executives who had been predicting 12 million people would visit the site. By February, however they were forced to cut the prediction to 10 million and then revise the figure down in subsequent months. </p> <p>'In November everybody on the NMEC board was alerted that it would need additional funding. Advanced ticket sales were just not happening,' a senior Dome source said. </p> <p>'The Millennium Commission recognised the need[for more cash]. But Falconer was saying: \"No I don't want this done.\" The executive directors needed his approval because he dominates the board. No application was made, so by January you've got a mounting cash flow crisis.' </p> <p>NMEC's accounts state that the company had 'clearly defined capital expenditure control guidelines' linking its budgets to visitor forecasts and other targets. </p> <p>The board's failure to deal with the situation has meant that it has been forced to seek an extra \u00a3179 million from the commission to prevent the Dome going under. Asked directly if he had been consulted in November about applying for more cash, Falconer said: 'Not that I am aware of. It wouldn't be made to me. It is for NMEC to approach the commission. I wasn't at all NMEC board meetings.' </p> <p>However, the NMEC source said: 'Falconer was present at nearly all the board meetings and comes with a civil servant in tow. And, on the odd time he didn't come, he had the minutes sent to him. He pretends its as if he's just a shareholder in a company who doesn't know what's going on.' </p> <p>Falconer, a close friend of the Prime Minister, conceded: 'There were certainly discussions in November about advance ticket sales but I don't recall any suggestion at that stage that that was anything other than a time problem, which might affect cashflow.' </p> <p>Falconer also admitted for the first time that the situation was so bad by May, that he was prepared to agree an early closure for the Dome, despite the Government's public insistences that it would last all year. Only the discovery that it would be too expensive to close saved the Dome from shutting ignominiously at the end of the summer holidays. </p> <p>The disclosure comes as the nature of the contract between Nomura and the Government falls under the spotlight. Falconer refused to discuss the terms of the contract but informed sources say Nomura has been looking to negotiate a performance-related deal. </p> <p>This could mean that, while the bulk of the \u00a3105m would be paid up front, potentially as much as a quarter of the money won't be paid by the bank unless attendance targets for the new Nomura-run Dome are met.</p>",
  "Who says that Tony Blair has a care for nothing but popularity? The curtain falls on Mo Mowlam, the one member of his Cabinet whom it does not sound ridiculous to describe as loved. Compare and contrast with Charlie Falconer, ringmaster of the damned Dome, who hangs on to his job. The world knows what to make of these double-jointed scandals. The sainted Mo, National Treasure, has been hounded into premature retirement by the misogynist West Side Boys around Tony Blair. The right Charlie, National Disgrace, clings to his unelected office only because he is one of the Prime Minister's chums. <p>The truth is more complicated, and more interesting. I don't believe that Tony Blair was corrupted with envy by the public adoration for 'our one-and-only Mo', still less is he stupid enough to have wanted to martyr her. He has actually shown himself to be pretty indulgent of Mo - or perhaps that should be scared - by allowing her to remain in the Cabinet after she has served her notice to quit. The same cannot be said of all of his retinue. Courtiers will ever be wary of any Cabinet Minister who threatens to overshadow the Sun King. There certainly was sustained whispering that she was a loose cannon on the ship of state, who would have to be thrown overboard if she could not be lashed down, and it was not just confined to Number 10. A senior member of the Cabinet - and no, this is not Peter Mandelson speaking - told me some months ago, with a brutality that rather took my breath away: 'She's ill, of course.' </p> <p>The traffic was not all one-way. Understandably aggrieved that her massive contribution in Northern Ireland was not given all the credit it deserved, Mo and some of her friends did not help by fuelling chatter about a campaign to get her. At the beginning of the year, she told myself and a fellow journalist that her security arrangements were being reviewed, and suggested that she would be happy to live without the inconvenience of being manacled to bodyguards. After a discussion with my colleague, we decided not to write this up. Neither of us thought it a good idea to increase the risk of making her a target for a terrorist. A couple of weeks later, the withdrawal of her Special Branch protection was splashed up in another paper, with the interpretation that this was a deliberate humiliation of Mo by Number 10. </p> <p>So you can see why she has been the cause of flinching at Downing Street as you can also understand why her provocative unpredictability was as unpopular with some Cabinet colleagues as it was adored by the public. When she took part in a TV comedy show's dog wedding or told clitoris jokes or admitted she had inhaled or (horror!) talked about moving the Royals into modernised digs, her more buttock-clenched colleagues shuddered with distaste. The unbiddability which irritated the suits and spinmeisters was, of course, the other side of the coin of her public appeal. </p> <p>Blair wanted to exploit it. His mismanagement was not to find a way of harnessing her talents for the good of the Government. As I reveal in today's Review section, when he made it clear he wanted her to leave Belfast, she asked for the Foreign Office and, when he refused her that, she sought to be Defence Secretary as a step towards that goal. Contrary to what was written at the time, and was still being erroneously repeated last week, Blair did not block Mowlam from becoming Health Secretary. He offered her the job; she turned him down. That she wound up marginalised, miscast and miserable at the Cabinet Office was a failure for which she must bear as much responsibility as Tony Blair. Had both of them organised things more adeptly, she, not Ken Livingstone, would very probably now be Mayor of London. </p> <p>The decline of Mo is not so much about New Labour's sexist laddism. It has much more to do with an ecology of government that tends to be hostile to personalities of bright colour. Number 10 likes women so long as they are well-tailored, pastel-hued, softly-spoken, and unswervingly on-message. There is an anal-retentiveness about New Labour, born of its consuming fear of revisiting the party's past indiscipline and division, which struggles to accommodate individualists and exotics. With the exception of Peter Mandelson (a special case in so many respects), the faces that Tony Blair has promoted to the Cabinet have been managerial techocrats who taste of vanilla. Stephen Byers, Alistair Darling, Geoff Hoon and Alan Milburn are all personable fellows, but the sound of them droning out perfect, for-the-many-not-the-few New Labourese does not give anyone's heart an adrenaline spike. </p> <p>Mowlam may not have been much of a woman for detailed policy wonkery; what she possessed in abundance was emotional intelligence. She connected with the public. Whether you put it down to her cancer, her tactility, or even to artfulness, it is an exceptionally rare gift among contemporary politicians. New Labour has more than enough suits who can do the twiddly bits of government. What it is desperately short of - as are all the parties - is leading men and women who can engage the public's attention. I don't imagine anyone getting excited at the prospect of being hugged by Alistair Darling - with the possible exception of Mrs Darling. </p> <p>And the safe pairs of lips preferred by the Prime Minister do not necessarily turn out to be any more reliable than the supposedly difficult characters like Mo Mowlam. Stephen Byers had a career near-death experience over the fire sale of the Longbridge plant by BMW. Geoff Hoon is struggling with the Sierra Leone imbroglio. Alistair Darling's legislation provoked the biggest backbench revolt of this Parliament. </p> <p>The latter two are both lawyers. This Prime Minister, being a barrister married to a QC, invests enormous faith in the abilities of lawyers to master any brief and then stick to it. A degree in law has been more likely to win rapid promotion in his Government than any other qualification. Combine that with having shared a flat with the Prime Minister when you were both young wigs on the make, and you possess a golden swipe card to the inner sanctum of power. </p> <p>Charlie Falconer answers the need in all leaders to surround themselves with capable men whose dependence on patronage means that they can be entirely trusted and will never turn into rivals. The fiasco of the Dome is not of Lord Falconer's making. Its doom was already programmed in when it was thrown over to him in the wake of the disgrace of its original impresario, our old friend Mr Mandelson. Charlie was chosen for the task because, to the Prime Minister, no one seemed more reliable than his ex-flatmate. He had no other, obvious qualification for making a success of New Labour's monument to its own vanity. When he took charge of the Greenwich circus, Lord F cheerfully admitted to me that his only previous experience of the entertainment business was 20 years ago as a member of his college's May Ball committee. </p> <p>The Dome Minister's trajectory from anonymous pal to notorious crony serves to demonstrate that lawyer Ministers are not only duller than Mowlams, they are not necessarily any safer either. None of the bricks dropped by the 'gaffe-prone' Mo have thudded so resoundingly as Lord Falconer's apology, after the fiasco of the Dome's opening night, to 'VIPs and ordinary people'. He was speaking ironically, I am sure, but irony is an accent that a street-smart politician would never adopt in such a situation. </p> <p>A whole government of Mo Mowlams would be a nightmare. But a Cabinet without one Mo Mowlam will be poorer as well as a more tedious. And an entire government of lawyers will bore us and themselves to death.</p>",
  "The great self-generated myth about New Labour is that the Government is a smoothly seamless machine under the masterful control of the Prime Minister. It is not a myth that can survive the extraordinary chaos and confusion in Downing Street revealed by Andrew Rawnsley's authoritative book, Servants of the People, which we begin serialising today. <p>Barely a fortnight into the Government's life, Tony Blair was frantically phoning the Governor of the Bank of England, pleading with Eddie George not to precipitate a crisis in the City by resigning. The momentous choice not to join the European single currency in this Parliament, a decision with consequences which Britain has yet to resolve, was born out of manoeuvring between Prime Minister and Chancellor and executed amidst mayhem. Gordon Brown effectively bounced Blair into ruling out the euro, leaving the Prime Minister stranded and out of control at Chequers as Alastair Campbell went missing on the critical night. Arguments about taxation and spending between Blair and Brown have been as repeated as they have been fierce. </p> <p>Rawnsley's revelations will not be welcome to the Government's leading men, but the vigour of the struggles at the heart of New Labour is actually quite encouraging for those who feared real political debate was dying. The pity is that the rest of the country, the Cabinet included, have been excluded from the great arguments raging in the high command. The fixation with presenting a facade of fake unity, born out of an understandable obsession not to repeat Labour's history of disunity and defeat, has led to the doleful on-message culture which turns Ministers into automatons and switches off the public. </p> <p>This is not a style of politics - it is part of the explanation for the sad decision by Mo Mowlam to leave Parliament at the next election - which accommodates individualists who dare to express interesting and colourful opinions. The concentration of power at the top of the Government, and volatile decision-making by a very few in the feverish confines of Downing Street, has also led to some of New Labour's most grievous mistakes, the starkest of which is the monumental folly of the Millennium Dome. </p> <p>It is good to learn just how robust are the arguments between Prime Minister and Chancellor. It would be better if the rest of the country could now be allowed to join in. Tony Blair should not fear exposure of how his Government really works. The truth could even set New Labour free.</p>",
  "<p>The claim that nobody makes serious money from the Internet is not strictly true. The exception is the legal profession, which is rapidly discovering that cyberspace is almost as profitable an arena as corporate mergers and acquisitions. </p> <p>The latest episode in this '$600-an-hour-plus-expenses' farce closed last week with a US Federal judge ordering <a href=\"http://www.mp3.com\">MP3.com</a> to pay crippling damages to Universal, a record company that is part of the Seagram group, for alleged infringement of copyright on compact discs manufactured by the company. </p> <p>Judge Jed S Rakoff (sic) ruled that MP3.com had to pay $25,000 for each of the Universal compact discs included in its My.MP3.com service, which lets users listen to a CD over the internet after indicating that they possess the disc in question or have purchased it through an online vendor associated with the company. </p> <p>Universal had demanded $45,000 a disc but, even so, its lawyers emerged beaming and went off to order another five Lexus 400s apiece. </p> <p>There were similar scenes a few weeks ago when a troop of attorneys won an interim victory over Napster, a company that allows Internet users to share MP3 files over the net. Napster is appealing against the decision, as is MP3.com, so there are oodles more legal fees in the pipeline. Trebles all round for m'learned friends. </p> <p>Where will it all end? The possibilities for litigation are endless. Will we get to the point where the first appointee at every internet start-up is an in-house lawyer? Will governments eventually wake up to the fact that the unprecedented economic potential of the net is being choked by legal wrangling? Will the EU challenge the US patent laws that allow the patenting of 'business processes' such as Amazon's 1-Click ordering system? Will the Norwegian government see the absurdity of arresting a teenager on the grounds that he has violated the (US) Digital Millennium Copyright Act? And so on ad infinitum. </p> <p>Most media coverage of the MP3 and Napster cases fails to make a distinction between the companies on the one hand, and the technologies they seek to exploit on the other. Both MP3 and Napster are traditional start-ups, funded by large amounts of venture capital subscribed by very classy firms. These backers are not charitable institutions: they clearly saw a way of making money from their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. (In Napster's case, Hummer Winblad saw the economic potential of the 20 million users the company had acquired in less than a year .) If the interim judgments of the US courts stand, these venture capitalists will take a bath. Cue violins. </p> <p>But even if MP3.com and Napster are crippled or wiped out by litigation, the technologies on which they are based will continue to flourish. MP3 is now the global standard for compressing audio signals. It's free, public and universally available. </p> <p>Most 10-year-olds know how to 'rip' an audio CD into MP3 format. Similarly, the technology underlying Napster - software enabling peer-to-peer file-sharing - is out of the bottle, and new variants such as Gnutella, Freenet and AT&amp;T's Publius are up and running. (They are also technically impossible to police - though with Publius file sizes are limited to 100k, which makes it unusable for MP3 but perfectly good for text.) </p> <p>This is the reality that recording industry executives apparently cannot see. The logical conclusion of their current strategy is effectively to define every teenager on the planet as a criminal or a potential lawbreaker. </p> <p>Given that teenagers represent the prime market for recorded music, this looks like a lousy business strategy.

  "<p>Insurer Axa Equity &amp; Law has made little effort to explain in clear English how it proposes to compensate 750,000 with-profits policyholders for giving up their right to \u00a31.7 billion of orphan assets that it has built up. </p> <p>The documents, which thumped on to doormats two weeks ago, comprise 110 pages of incomprehensible jargon. Decoding has taken a while. The Treasury recommends that policyholders are generally entitled to at least 90 per cent of orphan assets - the surplus built up over the years after meeting policy payments and other liabilities - while shareholders should receive no more than 10 per cent. But actuaries commissioned by the Consumers' Association to work out what Axa's deal entails have found that the insurer is offering policyholders a measly 31 per cent - just \u00a3525 million of the \u00a31.7bn - while shareholders get at least 18 per cent, or \u00a3319m. </p> <p>Axa proposes to keep the rest, more than \u00a3800m, to pay for tax and to provide a surplus to ensure demands on the fund can be met. </p> <p>The CA describes the deal as 'shoddy'. It argues that careful tax planning could easily reduce the estimated \u00a3386m tax bill, and that a smaller surplus would provide adequate security. </p> <p>By dangling the offer of cash payments worth an average of \u00a3400 in front of policyholders, Axa no doubt hopes to push the deal through without opposition. Those who abstain or vote against the deal will receive no cash - which is bound to make many people vote in favour without considering the consequences. Their share of the orphan assets will be left in the fund. </p> <p>As Axa has said there is unlikely to be a distribution of orphan assets before 2006, anyone whose policy is to mature before then should consider voting in favour, as there is no guarantee they will gain through their policy's maturity value. </p> <p>Axa still claims the deal is fair, and says its judgment is supported by the Financial Services Authority and independent actuaries. But policyholders could be entitled to much more - an issue that should be contested in the High Court when Axa tries to ratify the deal. </p> <p>The CA is willing to help policyholders who want to challenge Axa.

  "<p>Do not worry about Invensys. It is simply having a 'growth pause'. A few redundancies, a bit of reorganisation and normal service will be resumed. At least, that is the message the company was trying to give out last week after the shock warning that its profits for the first half will be below last year's, and well behind what the market had been expecting. </p> <p>The City's view of that explanation was clear from the 40 per cent plunge in Invensys's share price. It does not believe a word of it. And it is concerned that, having got this bad, things can only get worse. </p> <p>The reaction is perfectly reasonable. It is less than a month since the controversial acquisition of Baan, the Dutch software-systems company, was finally clinched. Nowhere in the endless briefings and presentations about that deal was there the slightest hint that the rest of the business might be doing less well than expected. </p> <p>Indeed, the company says that chief executive Allen Yurko had his first indication things were going wrong at the start of August. He went on holiday for two weeks, came back and found his worst fears realised. Apart from the obvious issue of how he could enjoy a holiday when his company was heading for the rocks, it also raises the question of why Yurko did not spot trouble earlier. </p> <p>It may be that management's attention was distracted by the protracted fight to win control of Baan. That is a poor excuse. There is no point making any acquisition, and especially not one that carries the risks Baan does, if it jeopardises strategy elsewhere. </p> <p>The City has clearly decided that the problem is more serious. It was just about coming round to the idea that the merger of Siebe and BTR, from which Invensys was created, was a sensible deal and about to bear fruit. This profits warning raises the awful spectre of BTR, where bad news was invariably followed by worse. </p> <p>The group was making optimistic noises about the speed of cost-cutting and new contract wins at Baan, which has been owned for just a month. But even the biggest fans of the acquisition accept that it will take longer than that to prove a success. </p> <p>Six weeks ago, Throg Street suggested that Yurko's record meant he could be trusted to make a success of Baan. The profits warning means that record has been badly tarnished. Avoid the shares until there is clear evidence that the problems have been solved. </p> <p><strong> Self-assured?</strong><br> </p> <p>In financial services, it seems, the buzz word is Product. No sooner has Barclays forked out \u00a35.5 billion for Woolwich, largely on the strength of its Open financial services product, than Abbey National shells out \u00a31.8bn for Scottish Provident, principally to get its hands on the life company's Self Assurance product. </p> <p>You may think that Self Assurance is something your mother should have taught you but, apparently, it is the coming thing in financial services, offering all those essentials such as health cover, term assurance and accident insurance. There is, of course, no shortage of people trying to flog us these things, but Scottish Provident's unique selling point is that it does it all through one computer system. The result is a million different combinations of product that can be tailored to the customer's - or at least their adviser's - needs, yet is difficult for any rival, Abbey included, to replicate. </p> <p>Scottish Provident has 30 per cent of the market, giving it \u00a340 million in annual premiums. That, as Graham Pottinger, chief executive of Abbey's existing life assurance arm, Scottish Mutual Assurance, says, may be a lot in relation to total annual premium income. But in relation to the \u00a31.8bn consideration, it is tiny. </p> <p>Abbey's justification for the price is, first, that it is getting some other interesting business - such as an international business - too. Second, and more important, pushing Self Assurance through its much larger customer base should dramatically accelerate sales. </p> <p>It has made a decent job of doing that for products of Scottish Mutual, which it bought in 1992. New business has jumped from about \u00a3120m a year to \u00a33.5bn, while the number employed has risen threefold to 2,000. </p> <p>If it can achieve similar growth from Scottish Provident, the deal will be a resounding success. </p> <p>But the market is much more competitive, and Abbey already has a life insurance brand, so will be flogging two life products instead of just one to its long-suffering customers. This makes it far more difficult for it to earn a decent return from the deal. </p> <p>It may well do so, but the City will need evidence - and that will not emerge until 2002 at the earliest. Abbey's shares are cheap, but this acquisition is unlikely to change that. </p> <p><strong> Strange brew</strong><br> </p> <p>Why has Sir Ian Prosser chosen to split his role at the head of Bass now? Combining the jobs of chairman and chief executive has been frowned upon for a decade, so Bass can hardly claim to be reacting to changes in corporate governance rules. </p> <p>Nor will it save much money. Prosser will stay on as executive chairman, a role which he is unlikely to think worth less than his previous one. Tim Clarke, his successor as chief executive and currently head of the pubs and restaurants business, meanwhile, will presumably demand a pay rise for his added responsibility. </p> <p>It is also unlikely to persuade shareholders of a change in direction after a lacklustre share-price performance. Prosser will remain in charge of strategy - and how ready will his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 be to question his decisions? </p> <p>No such worries over at BBA, where much admired chief executive Roberto Quarta will step up to become non-executive chairman when he moves to private equity firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice next year. </p> <p>He leaves a business which has been transformed in his seven years at the helm: it now has an excellent track record of producing good organic growth, a decent share price performance and a respectable rating. </p> <p>He also leaves his highly respected finance director Roy McGlone in overall charge. Yet BBA's shares plunged 11 per cent while Bass's hardly moved. Surely some mistake.</p>",
  "Their countries are sworn enemies on the football pitch, they both aspire to be 'the leader of Europe' and they argue about the benefits of the euro. But Tony Blair and his German counterpart, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, yesterday agreed on one thing: that scrapping multi-million pound transfer fees for big-name footballers would be disastrous for the people's game. <p>In a joint offensive against the European Commission's controversial plan to abolish transfer fees for players switching clubs, the British and German Prime Ministers warned that the scheme could severely damage the game. </p> <p>The two leaders acknowledged that the current system 'is not perfect', but added: 'We fear, however, that a radical reform could have a negative impact on the structures of football in Europe. We share concerns that many smaller professional clubs would struggle to survive.' </p> <p>The EC has declared that the existing transfer system, under which stars have switch clubs for as much as \u00a337 million, is illegal because it breaks European law on freedom of movement. It has given football until the end of October to come up with an alternative way of handling players' movements. </p> <p>Football has condemned the EC's move as disastrous. It warns that without the 'trickle-down' effect of transfer fees from selling players to big clubs, scores of lower division sides in Britain could disappear. </p> <p>The Professional Footballers Association has warned that 'clubs will become like Euston station', with players staying only for a few months, that players' wages will spiral as high as \u00a3250,000-a-week and that fans will find it harder to identify with their local team. </p> <p>'Professional football has a proud history in both our countries', said Blair and Schr\u00f6der in a joint statement released by Downing Street. 'All our clubs are deeply rooted in the life of their towns and cities and provide a rich source of civic pride. Football fans are enthusiastic about their sport and feel a close loyalty to their clubs. We want it to stay this way.' </p> <p>Blair and Schr\u00f6der backed football's concern that the plan could discourage clubs from investing in development, saying: 'The clubs must be able to rely on a system that gives them sufficient opportunity to train young players, build up their teams and keep the game healthy at all levels.' </p> <p>A spokesman for the Cental Council of Physical Recreation, which represents sports such as rugby, cricket and soccer, said: 'This complicated legal and political issue affects other sports, not just football. But without the EC recognising sport as a special case, any agreement with the football authorities could still be open to legal challenge. Sport should not be treated as just a normal business'. </p> <p>The Football Association said the two leaders' support was 'hugely pleasing'. On Tuesday a new six-man Transfer Task Force of football representatives will meet at Uefa headquarters in Switzerland to start drawing up detailed plans for an alternative to the current system.</p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:denis.campbell@observer.co.uk\"> denis.campbell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "This is a story that goes back a century - to the dawn of American motoring and a relationship at the heart of America's first industrial boom. Then a car maker named Henry Ford turned to another Henry, a man named Firestone, to make tyres for his Model T, laying the foundations for two of America's biggest companies. <p>That historic partnership is now on the rocks, torn apart by one of America's biggest corporate scandals. It has seen Ford's most popular and profitable car in the US, the Explorer, and the oversize Firestone tyres that carry it, implicated in a series of accidents that have killed more than 80 people and injured hundreds more. </p> <p>To a disbelieving and increasingly angry American public, it is a story of deliberate duplicity in which their lives have been endangered. As the Ford-Firestone fiasco continues to build it has conformed to a classic American myth: the little man - a small-town Texan lawyer - pitted against the arrogance of big business, and winning. </p> <p>It may, however, be a very long haul and years before the full story of who knew what and when is finally revealed, as all sides deny culpability. For whatever or whoever is ultimately to blame - Firestone's ATX tyres, the design of the Explorer, or a deadly combination of the two - the official number of people who have died after tyres on the sport utility vehicle have shredded, causing the vehicle to roll over, now stands at 88, with injuries at 250. And the numbers may be far higher. More than 6.5 million tyres have been recalled, 47m more are suspect, executives have been hauled before Congress to explain. </p> <p>The crisis is not limited to the US. On Friday the French government approved the recall of all Firestone ATX tyres, citing concern over the deaths in America and in Venezuela where fatal accidents have been reported. </p> <p>It is clear that American consumers, and those in 15 other countries, have been misinformed or misled. Moreover, both companies have made serious mistakes in handling the crisis. </p> <p>Americans by the hundreds of thousands have put themselves on waiting lists for replacement tyres, and garages have had to field countless calls from drivers worried about the tiniest shred on their tread. As the Justice Department mulled over a formal investigation last week it was clear that the crisis would not go away. </p> <p>The problems only came to light through the efforts of Randy Roberts, a lawyer from East Texas, who took up the case of Jessica LeAnn Taylor, a high school cheerleader who died in a car accident in October 1998. A friend of Taylor's mother was driving when the tread of her Explorer's Firestones allegedly peeled off like a banana skin and the vehicle rolled over. Roberts sued Firestone; the company claimed it knew of only one other similar incident. </p> <p>In November last year, a judge ordered Firestone to turn over all complaints and lawsuits. According to Roberts, there had been more than 1,100 incidents and 57 lawsuits by February this year. </p> <p>Last weekend a 10-year-old boy was killed when the driver of a Firestone-equipped Explorer lost control of the vehicle and it flipped off an interstate near Laredo, Texas. Authorities said at least one of the tyres was shredded. </p> <p>Whatever the cause of the tragedy, Ford and Firestone are guilty as charged in the court of public opinion. 'They've known something was wrong for years,' said Lori Lazarus, a 31-year-old schoolteacher whose Explorer flipped after a Firestone tyre shredded on a Florida highway in 1996. Lazarus survived but still suffers from headaches and balance problems and is suing both companies. </p> <p>For Ford the issue is doubly disastrous. The Explorer has been the goose that lays the golden egg, providing a quarter of its profits. Ford's chief executive, Jacques Nasser, looking sombre and earnest, appears in ads to reassure customers by pledging to work 'around the clock' to resolve the crisis. For Firestone, the outcome is potentially more dire. Ford accounts for 32 per cent of the company's orders and analysts warn that it will probably fold if future contracts are not awarded, as seems increasingly likely. </p> <p>At congressional hearings into the controversy last week, the chief executive of Firestone, Masatoshi Ono, said: 'I come before you to apologise to you, the American people - especially the families who have lost loved ones in these terrible rollover accidents.' Nasser testified that the company did not take action because a review of various databases assured the form - wrongly, as it turned out - that there was not a problem. </p> <p>But evidence is mounting that the companies had known about separating tyre-tread problems for years. Lawsuits against the firms relating to the tyres on the Explorer date back to 1991 and documents show that Firestone began reimbursing consumers for faulty tyres as far back as 1989. </p> <p>Moreover, it appears that the companies knew about the problems in 1998 when they began replacing the tyres on Explorers in Saudi Arabia, Asia and South America. But it failed to reveal the recall to US regulators until May this year. In Venezuela, where the Ford replaced faulty Firestones a month before the US recall, regulators have accused Ford and Firestone of conspiracy after 46 died in Firestone-equipped Explorers. </p> <p>Ford maintains its vehicle is sound and only Firestone's tyres are defective. Firestone, a division of Japan's Bridgestone Corp, counters that a factor beyond its control - namely a lower tyre pressure recommended by the auto giant - is to blame. Without admitting liability, both companies now acknowledge they might have appreciated the magnitude of the problem earlier. </p> <p>Whatever the truth, warning signs that the Explorer-Firestone combination was a danger were easily missed - or obscured. </p> <p>'Ford and Firestone had at a minimum a moral obligation to make sure that the products they sell are safe,' said Senator Richard C. Shelby. 'And yet they both failed to bring this issue to consumers' and the federal government's attention, at the cost of dozens of lives.' </p> <p>If Ford and Firestone knew of problems and did nothing, federal regulators could impose up to $925,000 in fines. The companies could also face criminal charges. The biggest potential damage is that the image of the companies will become so tarnished that customers avoid their products. </p> <p>Both say their August sales showed little effect from the recall but some independent dealers say customers are now avoiding Firestone tyres. </p> <p>Many safety experts believe that long after tempers have cooled it will be discovered that no single factor is to blame for the crashes. 'You've got a vehicle on the margin of stability and a tyre on the margins,' says accident investigator Dick Baumgardner. 'Put them together and you've got a disaster.'</p>",
  "Electromagnetic pulses from military craft may have been responsible for several civilian airline disasters in the past four years. If the theory is proved correct, it suggests navy ships and air force planes pose a lethal threat to passenger flights. <p>Crash investigators have been startled by similarities between several tragedies. In particular, they have uncovered common features in two crashes: Swissair 111, on 2 September 1998, and TWA 800, on 17 July 1996. Both planes took off from the same airport, New York's JFK, on the same day, a Wednesday, at the same minute, 8.19pm. Both followed the same route over Long Island. Both reported trouble in the same region of airspace, and both suffered catastrophic electrical malfunctions. And on both occasions the planes were flying at a time when extensive military exercises - involving submarines and US Navy P3 fighter planes - were being conducted. </p> <p>These factors - outlined by Elaine Scarry in the forthcoming issue of the New York Review of Books - suggest to many investigators that a routine weekly event, probably involving the generation of strong electromagnetic pulses by military personnel, may have triggered short-circuits in the two planes. </p> <p>In the case of the TWA 800 flight, this could have caused a spark to set off a fire in its fuel tanks. Alternatively, a pulse could have knocked out instruments, causing the Boeing 747 to spin out of control, making metal parts tear and produce sparks. </p> <p>In the case of the Swissair 111, a fire was reported in the cabin and the plane plunged into the sea off the coast of Nova Scotia.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:robin.mckie@observer.co.uk\"> robin.mckie@observer.co.uk </a></p>",
  "The climbers were faced with a stark choice. Having risked their lives on some of the most challenging mountains in the world, where only their skill and courage had kept them going, the four-strong American group seized by kidnappers during an expedition in a remote part of former Soviet-controlled Asia contemplated the ultimate dilemma: kill their guard or face being killed themselves. <p>In an epic real-life adventure story that has prompted a frenzied bidding war between Hollywood film studios and New York publishers, the real story of the mountaineers and the guard they pushed off a cliff to certain death is only now beginning to emerge. </p> <p>The expedition had begun well enough. When Jason 'Singer' Smith, 22, and his friends set off to climb in the Pamir mountains in Kyrgyzstan they thought they knew what they were getting into. The Karavashin region, 10,000ft up in the mountains, has become a Mecca for adventurous mountaineers and the four Americans planned to grab their own share of climbing glory by conquering a number of new climbs. </p> <p>The drama that engulfed the young team began while Smith and his three companions were bivouacking hundreds of feet up a vertical rock face. After days of climbing, they planned to spend their first night on a cramped platform they had carried up with them, an aluminium-framed 'portaledge' - a campsite hanging in the sky. </p> <p>Hanging from ropes far above the ground, they slotted together the alloy poles, discussed the next day's route up the unclimbed face and looked forward to a simple dinner and an unnerving night's rest above the black void. With Smith were John Dickey, at 25 the oldest member of the group, and two Californians, Tommy Caldwell, 22, and Beth Rodden, 20, at 5ft and six stone, a tiny but brilliant woman who had quickly become one of world's most famous female climbers. </p> <p>The expedition had been sold as a big deal in the lucrative world of US outdoor marketing. It had been backed by the leading outdoor designer label The North Face, and Dickey and Smith were there to photograph the two 'stars' of the climb, Caldwell and Rodden, as they inched up the face. Rodden was a recent recruit to The North Face. For all of them, a lot was riding on a successful climb. </p> <p>What happened next turned their adventure into a nightmare. As they rested on cramped ledges, they were startled by the sound of guns being fired in their direction from the valley below. They were sitting targets in the middle of a blank granite wall high above the ground, and any thought of ignoring the shooting and continuing to the summit disappeared when bullets started hitting the rock around them. </p> <p>Terrified, the team agreed that one of them should abseil down to negotiate with the gunmen, and it was Dickey who was elected to do the talking. According to friends who spoke to The Observer last week, he abseiled down to the foot of the cliff where he was immediately surrounded by three armed Uzbeks, members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which is fighting for the creation of an independent Muslim state where the borders of Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan converge. The group regularly kidnaps westerners and has plunged the area into political chaos. </p> <p>Confronted by the gunmen, Dickey knew they were in deep trouble. Their base camp was in ruins and the Uzbeks, with barely any English, were in no mood to negotiate. The kidnappers had already destroyed most of their tents and spare equipment and Dickey quickly complied with the gunmen's hand-signalled orders, telling his friends over their radio to descend to the certainty of captivity and the possibility that they would die. </p> <p>According to friends, the gunmen ordered the four to gather what food they could and go with them. Grabbing a few energy bars, the climbers endured a six-day ordeal, being moved at night by two of the guerrillas and being forced to hide during the day under brush or rocks from the view of Kyrgyz army helicopters. If they did not understand the risks of non-compliance, it was made abundantly clear five hours into their captivity. To their horror, a Kyrgyz soldier whom the guerrillas had kidnapped earlier was taken away and shot. </p> <p>Smith was forced to sit on the body for 40 minutes before the group continued. Continuously hungry, forced to drink foul water from puddles and in constant fear for their lives, the four stumbled by night under the watchful gaze of their captors and froze during the day, unable to move in their shadowy hideouts. 'I thought about everything,' Caldwell said afterwards, 'I thought about the meaning of life, what these people were after.' </p> <p>On the sixth day, one of their guards returned to base to collect fresh batteries for the radios taken from the climbers. The hostages found themselves on top of a high granite cliff with one man watching over them. It was then that they hatched their escape plan. </p> <p>No one knows who acted first and the climbers are not saying - yet. But at a press conference in her hometown of Davis, California, Rodden gave the briefest outline of what happened: 'While moving at night and guarded by only one rebel, we at last saw a chance to escape by pushing our guard off the cliff. It is so hard to think of that now, but we were afraid we would not survive.' </p> <p>The tight-knit climbing community in the US has speculated that it was the charismatic Smith, a natural leader, who would have had the courage to rush an armed man, but friends of the climbers told The Observer that all four had acted together to push the Uzbek over the edge. After the guard fell to what the climbers assume was certain death, the four immediately started running 'like Forrest Gump', as Smith described it to his mother, covering 18 miles to a Kyrgyz army outpost. </p> <p>But their ordeal was not yet over. As they approached the post they were shot at again, this time by Kyrgyz troops mistaking them for guerrillas. Caldwell, Dickey and Rodden dived for cover behind rocks but Smith kept running, finding himself surrounded by soldiers. He shouted: 'We're Americans! We're Americans!' </p> <p>'You'd never believe how good tinned sardines can taste,' Caldwell said of their first meal in almost a week. They were given army fatigues and were met at Batken by the Kyrgyz president, Askar Akayev, who flew the four climbers to Bishkek in his personal jet before they were transferred to the US Embassy. </p> <p>Since returning to the US at the end of August the four have been besieged by American and foreign media eager to buy up their story. After signing an exclusive contract with Outside magazine, the team have been auctioning a book about their adventure and several studios are bidding for the film rights. Smith is also believed to have given an interview to Playboy magazine. </p> <p>Not all of the interest has been friendly. Rejecting criticism that the climbers had been foolhardy in going to such a politically unstable area in the first place, Rodden's father told reporters that she was 'doing remarkably well under the circumstances'. He said advice found by the team on the internet suggested that the risk was minimal. The US State Department, however, has been warning Americans to stay away from the region for more than a year.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Luzhin Defence</strong> (108 mins, 12) Directed by Marleen Gorris; starring John Turturro, Emily Watson, Geraldine James, Stuart Wilson </p> <p>Football is the world's most popular sport. Yet there's never been a movie of the first rank about soccer and almost the only convincing game is the outrageous match dominated by Brian Glover as the player-referee in Kes. </p> <p>On the other hand, chess, the world's most cerebral pastime, the real intricacies of which relatively few people comprehend, has been the subject of some classic and highly popular pictures over the years. </p> <p>From Pudovkin's satirical Chess Fever and Raymond Bernard's The Chess Player in the silent era, through Bergman's Seventh Seal and Satyajit Ray's The Chess Player, to the recent American movies Searching for Bobby Fischer (aka Innocent Moves) and Losing Isaiah, pieces have been shifted on chequered boards. </p> <p>One explanation is that it's difficult to stage a complex team game like football. A more obvious one is that chess provides a series of immediately understood metaphors - for life and death in the Bergman movie, for a crafty move by the Raj in Ray's film, and for the dialectics of gang warfare in Losing Isaiah. The game is also highly photogenic. </p> <p>The Dutch director Marleen Gorris (whose last film was a version of Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway) adds to this list of distinguished chess movies with The Luzhin Defence. A work of considerable intellectual and physical elegance, it's rather cleverly adapted by a British writer Peter Berry from Vladimir Nabokov's 1930 novel. </p> <p>In this book, Nabokov discovered his mature style and established himself at the age of 30 as the pre-eminent Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 author, though it wasn't translated into English for 33 years. </p> <p>For more than a decade, John Turturro has been specialising in characters whose awkward bodies contain flashing minds, troubled spirits and pure hearts. </p> <p>In Marleen Gorris's film, he's utterly convincing as the 30-ish Alexander Luzhin, a Russian chess master whose life comes into dangerously combustible focus in 1929 when he comes to a hotel beside Lake Como to take part in a tournament. </p> <p>The shambling, unkempt Luzhin has been bound up with chess all his life, and flashbacks to his childhood, part hell, part idyll in Tsarist St Petersburg, reveal how this obsession was shaped by his haut-bourgeois parents' loveless marriage and his relationship with the beautiful aunt who introduced him to the game. </p> <p>After destroying his father at the chess board, he beats his former schoolmaster, the demonic Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), who becomes his exploitative 'chess father', taking him around Europe as a prodigy for 14 years, before dropping him when his game begins to falter. </p> <p>At Lake Como, Luzhin meets a possible redeemer in the form of Natalia (Emily Watson), an unconventional beauty, daughter of rich aristocratic Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s. A rebel against her rigid background, she sees beneath the unprepossessing surface, beyond the lack of small talk and social graces, to the beauty of his soul. </p> <p>Natalia is attracted rather than repelled by the intensity of his feelings, and when he suddenly proposes marriage, she accepts. Watson with her radiant smile and blue eyes and Turturro with his twitching grimaces and brown eyes make this curious, precipitate courtship ring affectingly true. </p> <p>But in addition to being a love story, The Luzhin Defence is a thriller about rivalry, power and destruction. Ranged against Luzhin are Natalia's parents, who have understandable reservations, the immaculately groomed Italian grandmaster he must face, and the suave, vindictive Valentinov, who has returned to abet the fall of his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9. </p> <p>A deadly endgame faces him, on and off the board. As he stands on the brink of total collapse, his mind as fragile as the glass king he's carried since learning chess as a child, there emerges the alternative of abandoning chess for Natalia. 'A balanced normal life - is that what I've got to reduce him to?' she asks a psychiatrist. </p> <p> The Luzhin Defence flirts with melodrama in a way that Nabokov doesn't, and plays with obvious (if persuasive) Freudian explanations of the sort Nabokov consistently mocked. But it mounts to an exciting climax, and is resolved in a manner I found quietly satisfying, though some may think it glib.</p>",

This is a China Syndrome meltdown of a movie that makes the Farrelly Brothers' Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary resemble late Victorian pieces like The Magistrate and Charley's Aunt. </p> <p>Ostensibly Scary Movie sets out to do for recent horror movies what Airplane did for the disaster and group jeopardy pictures. Its central dramatic spine, combining the plots of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer , has a group of stereotypical high school seniors stalked by a serial killer in cowl and death mask and menaced by phone calls over a death they'd concealed the previous year. The problem is that unlike such po-faced pictures as Airport and The Poseidon Adventure that the Zucker Brothers were sending up in Airplane , the Scream series are post-modern jokes that have self-mockery built in like smoke-activated sprays. </p> <p>The result is that the laughter raised by references to Scream, The Matrix, The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense, as well as to other recent movies (Titanic, Amistad and The Usual Suspects are mildly lampooned in a TV sketch style), is occasioned less by witty invention than by mere recognition. There is also an all too prevalent notion, popularised by Cheech and Chong, that drugs and the antics of those under the influence of drugs are funny in themselves. </p> <p>As I've implied, however, the pastiches of horror flicks are a minor part of the film's appeal. What makes Scary Movie distinctive (for the next few months at least) are the number and intensity of the gross-outs or moments of bad taste calculated to induce groans and simulated (or actual) vomiting in the audience. </p> <p>The most traditional of these are fart jokes, starting in the pre-credit scene and all involving women. Then there are homosexual jokes, mostly emanating from the fact that a handsome black student (Shawn Wayans) is attracted to other men but doesn't realise he's gay. The third, now almost traditional, source of humour involves previously taboo subjects like oral sex, masturbation and orgasms. A mentally retarded policeman masturbates using a vacuum cleaner; a boy comes so violently that his girlfriend is plastered to the ceiling with his semen. </p> <p>These are, as Neil Armstrong might put it, small steps for a man, compared with the larger, exponential steps Scary Movie takes for mankind. Early on in the picture a boy receives a terrible electric shock from the barbed wire defences on a virgin's loins. So far, so bad. Then, when she finally makes herself available to him, he discovers that her public hair has proliferated to such a degree that he has to take an electric hedgecutter to it before they can have sex. </p> <p>The biggest breakthrough occurs when the latent homosexual puts his head to a hole in a lavatory cubicle from which an erect penis penetrates his ear and reappears on the other side of his head. Now this is the stuff of sexual nightmares, urban legends, Krafft-Ebing case histories. Pathological? Certainly. Therapeutic? Possibly. </p> <p>Thomas Wolfe said that you can't go home again, an admonition disregarded by writer-director Barry Levinson, who after Diner, Tin Men and Avalon, returns once more to the Baltimore of his youth with <strong> Liberty Heights</strong>. This schematic exercise in nostalgia starts in the autumn of 1954, a time of social change in America. The Supreme Court has overturned the 'separate but equal' education policies of Southern states; McCarthyism runs high despite the censuring of McCarthy himself; rock'n'roll is starting to attract white youth; TV is becoming the dominant medium of entertainment. </p> <p>At the centre is the Kurtzman family, middle-class, quite well-off, semi-orthodox Jews living in a predominantly Jewish area. Dad (Joe Mantegna) is subsidising his money-losing burlesque house by engaging in the numbers racket which brings him into dangerous contact with drug-dealing blacks. His younger son, a high school senior, secretly dates a pretty black girl, the only one in his newly integrated school, and her doctor father disapproves. His older son, an undergraduate, becomes obsessed with a beautiful blonde WASP heiress, and is mocked by her virulently anti-semitic friends. </p> <p>It's attractively performed, but all a little too neat. Levinson's ear for the speech of the time isn't entirely convincing and I find it hard to believe that a country club in 1954 Maryland would carry the sign 'No Jews, Dogs or Coloured Allowed'. The period decor is laid on with a loving trowel and the film is given a romantic glow by the Hong Kong-based Australian cinematographer Chris Doyle using his trademark images of bright-coloured neon reflected on shiny black surfaces and people seen through distorting windows. </p> <p>Bruno Dumont's first movie La Vie de J\u00e9sus, a deadly portrait of spiritually deprived lives in that dreary stretch of northern France between Lille and Calais, passed the accidie test. Set in the same depressing milieu, his flat, Bressonian <strong> L'Humanit\u00e9</strong>, which won the Grand Prix du Jury as well as the best actor and actress prizes at Cannes last year, fails in every possible way. </p> <p>Its blank hero, Pharaon De Winter (Emmanuel Schott\u00e9), is a dim plain-clothes cop who changes his shirts more often than he changes his expressions. He's so shocked by the hopelessness of this world (and traumatised by the recent death of his girlfriend and son) that he slopes around, his arms hanging down his side. He's supposedly investigating the brutal murder of an 11-year-old girl, but evinces not the slightest knowledge of standard police procedure. You'd think he and his dopey boss were intended to satirise the ineffectuality of French law enforcement, were it not that everybody else acts like wind-up toys. </p> <p>Despite the murder investigation (which takes him on a risible visit to England to interrogate people who might have witnessed the killing from EuroStar) Pharaon has loads of time to dig in his allotment and hang out with a local girl and her boyfriend. From time to time this couple engage in frenzied copulation, an activity we're obviously supposed to frown on. Now it's clear that this isn't intended to be a realistic story, that we're in the presence of what the earnest Dumont intends as something higher - a statement about the current human condition. I would commend to him, and similar high-minded people, the words of the great American critic Malcolm Cowley in his book The Human Condition 50 years ago. Worried by the aridity and pretentiousness of recent young novelists, he commended to them three anti-slogans that apply, mutatis mutandis, to Dumont. 'If it isn't real, it isn't a symbol. If it isn't a story, it isn't a myth. If a character doesn't live he can't be an archetype of American life.' </p> <p> Brigadoon is set in a magical Scottish village that appears once every 100 years. The dire <strong> The Closer You Get</strong>, directed by a Scot, scripted by an Englishman, and produced by the begetter of The Full Monty , takes place in 1999 in a distinctly unmagical Oirish village on the coast of Donegal that might have existed a century ago but makes no sense today. The plot about strong local women rumbling the men's plot to lure American girls from Miami is an ill-considered nonsense. By the end my toes were so curled up with embarrassment that had I tried a spot of river-dancing I'd have fallen on my face.</p>",
  "I don't wish to be a killjoy, but a brilliant, authoritative new book on the life of Bob Dylan by Clinton Heylin has a flaw in it. Heylin credits Dylan with having introduced the Beatles to marijuana in August 1964. Apparently Dylan dropped in on the Fab Four in their New York hotel, and not finding any 'cheap wine', his preference over the champagne on offer, he rolled a joint. Paul McCartney is quoted as saying he 'discovered the meaning of life that evening' and it has thus gone down in Dylan legend that that was the moment the Beatles first got high on weed. <p>It might have been a first for Macca, but I know for certain that it wasn't for John Lennon. Lennon took his first puff or two of pot a few months earlier; in the spring of '64, in a basement flat in Bayswater. Not only did he smoke his first joint, or 'reefer', as it was called then, but he also threw up. I know this because I was there. </p> <p>I was a Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald fan then, and I didn't 'get' the Beatles until Sergeant Pepper three years later, so meeting John Lennon did not have the same appeal for me as the memory of it does today. But even I, who was not enamoured, knew that it was a seminal moment to see Lennon sick in the bath after his first smoke. There had been so much made of the Beatles' clean-cut image, those 'loveable mopheads'. Beatlemania had swept Europe the previous autumn and the Beatles had been top of the album charts for 51 consecutive weeks with their first album, Please, Please Me. They had had a clutch of No 1 singles and by the end of '63 their single, 'She Loves You', was the biggest-selling single of all time in the UK. In February '64, just before I met John Lennon, the Beatles conquered the US with 10,000 screaming fans awaiting their arrival at JFK airport. At the end of March '64 they had the awe-inspiring top five slots on the Billboard charts with 'Can't Buy Me Love', 'Twist and Shout', 'She Loves You', 'I Want to Hold Your Hand', and 'Please, Please Me'. In March they were filming A Hard Day's Night. </p> <p>How John and Cynthia came to be in that flat in Palace Court I do not know. It belonged to a couple called Pat and Tony Shaw. Pat was an incredibly beautiful 28-year-old hourglass blonde and Tony was a portly, bearded, jovial man in his fifties with a penchant for watching his 'wife' in bed with other men. I lived around the corner in Clanricarde Gardens and a few weeks before had been invited to a beatnik party a few doors along from my flat. I braved it and went alone. </p> <p>The place was full of scruffy people sitting around on the floor, the air thick with smoke and dope. I felt out of my depth, a bit wary, and was about to leave when this stunning threesome stepped into the halo of light in the hallway. A beautiful blonde in a shimmering silver dress flanked by two handsome men with glittering blue eyes and wearing identical Prince of Wales check suits. To my astonishment, one of the men asked me to dance. His name, so he told me, was Baron Pierre Cervello, and he was engaged, he later told me, to Mandy Rice-Davies, who was involved in the then breaking Profumo scandal. Over the next few months Pierre would introduce me to an underlife in London which was both breathtakingly sordid and wondrous at the same time. Orgies with film stars and nobility and layers of willing girls. I was an innocent 18-year-old, fresh out of virginity, and I assumed that as I was at what appeared to be the epicentre of fashionable London, then it was absolutely the fashionable thing to do - to swing. Everybody, it seemed, was a swinger. For the record, I only ever participated with Pierre... well I would say that, wouldn't I? But it was true, for I did, along with dozens of other women, totally adore him, and was completely in his thrall. </p> <p>The gorgeous blond at this beatnik party that night was Pam and the other devilishly handsome lothario was a French hairdresser called Raphael de Rosa, who was in partnership with Leonard, who later became Twiggy's hairdresser. (They were Raphael and Leonard, until Raphael did a bunk with the takings one day). Falling in behind them, quite inconspicuously, was Tony. Pierre whisked me off from that party to my first quasi-public coupling round at Pam and Tony's. We watched a blue film (my first), then Pierre seduced me on the sofa and Pam and Raphael bonked in the bedroom with Tony blithely looking on. I don't think any doors ever closed in that flat. </p> <p>Somehow the Lennons stumbled into this den of iniquity in or around March 1964. I received a phone call at about 9pm from Pierre saying he would be collecting me in 15 minutes to go to a party. We fetched up at Palace Court at the same time as the Shaws were climbing out of a car with Cynthia and John Lennon, who was already a bit sozzled. Inside, I remember Cynthia drinking only water but John and Tony had Scotch. Pierre never drank, as far as I knew. I didn't like Scotch but that's all there was, so Tony put a Coca-Cola in it. Funny the things you remember and those you forget... </p> <p>Tony and John were laughing and joking and Pat was slyly acting provocatively around the star. Pierre whispered to me that the plan was to get John Lennon into bed with Pat and he would have to distract Cynthia. I was wondering if Pierre was going to try to inveigle Cynthia into a 'situation' with him. I remember pleading with him not to leave me with Tony, although I don't think that Tony was inclined towards me. He got his rocks off in other ways. </p> <p>Tony produced a huge reefer, and although 37 years later I cannot recall the conversation, it was understood that Lennon hadn't tried it before. But the cool thing to do was just to take it when it was passed to you. And so he did. I can remember thinking that Cynthia, who was very subdued, was unhappy that John wanted to smoke the dope. </p> <p>'Don't have any more,' she said when Tony poured yet another drink for Lennon. I felt sorry for Cynthia because she plainly didn't want to be there and had no idea, as far as I could tell, what the others had up their sleeves. </p> <p>We seemed to drift into the bedroom and the inevitable blue film was put on the projector. In case you're wondering we all still had our clothes on, although I have a picture in my mind of Pat in black bra and pants on the bed talking to John at some point. John was giggling and swaying around, and suddenly he staggered into the bathroom which was off the bedroom, and was puking into the white enamel bath. </p> <p>Cynthia was quickly by his side, holding on to his juddering shoulders as he retched and heaved. It was awful. The four of us looked on in quiet bemusement. It was embarrassing to watch this huge pop phenomenon, who was a god to tens of thousands of fans, being a basic human being. Like catching the queen on a Portaloo. But we couldn't tear our eyes away. </p> <p>I thought, 'Wow... John Lennon being sick in the bath... Imagine.' They left pretty hurriedly after that, and Pierre took me home in a sulk. </p> <p>You know what they say about the Sixties. That if you remember it you weren't 'there'. Most of those who were 'there' are not here today to tell it. So in that respect I'm rather glad I wasn't. </p> <p>\u0095 To order Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades by Clinton Heylin for \u00a317 plus 99p p&amp;p, call Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171</p>",
  "<p>Armistead Maupin lives on a mountain, vertiginously overseeing a city of the plain. The steep height is in San Francisco, and the city beneath his glazed, suspended chalet used to be Sodom. He can glimpse the red span of the Golden Gate Bridge which triumphally subjugates the Pacific, and the pyramidal Transamerica skyscraper which optimistically straddles the San Andreas fault. In the distance is Macondray Lane on Russian Hill, a tunnel of regressive greenery straggling back into the secret garden of our shared childhood: here Maupin located the happy, communal Eden which he calls Barbary Steps in Tales of the City , his six-volume chronicle of frisky San Francisco in the Seventies and Eighties. </p> <p>Tucked away directly below his home, as if secreted in a bodily cleft, is Castro Valley, once the city's gay ghetto, now - as Maupin acidly observes in his new novel The Night Listener - a slick, commercialised 'theme park for homos'. Maupin sometimes ventures down to Castro at lunchtime, passing a juice bar where his name is inscribed on a fresco of queer celebrities, and dodging tour guides who point to him as a mobile monument, like a greying, pudgy statue on leave from his plinth. Then he puffs back up the slope, armed with some food for dinner and a hard-core video for dessert. 'These days,' he told me with a grimace, 'my sex life consists of me and the VCR.' </p> <p>This is the shock of California, where complete strangers insist on being psychologically intimate with you. Maupin is relentlessly 'in your face' even if what he presses into one's face is his private parts. All writers are confidential in print, although most of them turn opaque or evasive when you confront them in person. Not Maupin, whose sense of moral rectitude makes frankness mandatory. 'Sex,' as he commented to me, 'is the last area of human experience where people think it's OK to lie. And when gay people lie about their sexuality, they condemn others - who are oppressed, or maybe sick - to death. This is just who I am. Everything I've ever written is based on something in my life.' Discussing his books, he is only too eager to hand over the key with which you can unlock the roman \u00e0 clef . 'It's my own memories, preserved like dragon-fly in amber,' he said as he looked back on Tales of the City . </p> <p>Maupin grew up in conservative North Carolina: the family's background, and its grimmest, guiltiest secrets, are aired in The Night Listener . He pleased his mother by dating local girls and half-heartedly petting on the way home. He obediently followed his starchy father into the navy. Then, after serving in Vietnam, he moved to San Francisco where - on a timid sortie to a gay bathhouse - he experienced a convulsive sexual awakening. Because sex changed his life, he speaks of it with the zeal of the spiritual convert, to which, when the issue is the oppressive force of hypocrisy, he adds the angry militancy of the political radical. </p> <p>His fiction emerged from a journalistic study of his new home town. In 1977, investigating urban courtship rites, he watched yuppies exchanging molten glances over the papayas in a San Francisco supermarket. His subjects refused to be interviewed, so he turned his report into a short story for a local newspaper. The characters he created - the na\u00efve provincial new arrival Mary Ann, and the gay man she ineffectually targets, Michael Tolliver - were still around in the last volume of the Tales, 13 years later. Maupin's comedy of manners documented what he calls 'the invention of a culture': a social experiment in which people who had fled to San Francisco from their stuffy Midwestern homes, or had been rejected by parents intolerant of their sexual dissidence, assembled new families consisting of friends and transitory bed-partners. 'It was this perfect thing that stopped,' Maupin said, referring both to the Tales and to the society it portrayed. It stopped because he gave up writing the books, but also because the world it described ceased to exist. By the last book, the ingenuous Mary Ann is a glossy, ruthless television personality, and Michael, once happily feckless, is incubating a case of Aids. Paradise has been lost. </p> <p>People loved the Tales because they adhered to an old-fashioned formula, disdained by modernists with their contempt for straightforward storytelling. Maupin revived the Dickensian serial novel, which makes you laugh, makes you cry, and makes you wait for the next episode. Contributing weekly instalments to the San Francisco Chronicle , Maupin devised cliffhanging crises to tease his readers: Hitchcock's Vertigo , that great film about the vertical excitements of hilly San Francisco, is alluded to throughout the Tales (and is even more ingeniously imitated by a plot twist in The Night Listener). As those laughing, crying, breathlessly waiting readers began to talk back to him in letters, he allowed their desires to help dictate the way characters evolved. You could enjoy imaginary dangers because the continuity of the narrative guaranteed safe landings. Is Mary Ann a murderess? Are the night sweats of her adulterous husband Brian a symptom of Aids? No, of course not. This structure, with its tantalising postponements and its cosy pacification of change, effortlessly mutated into soap opera when Channel 4 began filming the Tales . </p> <p>But their success proved burdensome. One sequel after another - More Tales, Further Tales and so on - disputed the very notion that anything, human life included, needed to end. How could Maupin reconcile this with the actuality of a city whose young men were dying in droves? He therefore wound up all those simultaneous stories in Sure of You , published in 1990. Nevertheless, he found that the books 'just wouldn't go away'. He has spent the intervening years producing them for television, consorting with actors who play his dead friends and his own, younger slimmer self. In the third series, filmed this summer, he treats himself to a Hitchcockian walk-on, and can be seen making a nostalgic, unfulfilled exit from a sex club as Michael struts expectantly in. Though his admirers wanted more, he feared facile self-repetition. But would he ever be able to do anything different? In 1993 he wrote Maybe the Moon; also a gauzy fairytale about the dwarf who inhabited E.T.'s rubber suit in Spielberg's film. Now The Night Listener makes a more determined effort to cast off the blithe, breezy manner of the Tales and to start again. Its tale is cruel not kind, and it begins in a chapter of self-accusation by warning us that the storyteller is a congenital liar. </p> <p>Maupin is embarrassed that his readers cherish him as a well-wishing friend, an agony uncle whose job is to solve their problems, just as he neatly extricates the characters in Tales from their predicaments. During our talk he showed me letters moist with confessions and requests for advice. But the emotional needs of all these strangers only make him more aware of his own bereft solitude. Where's the novelist who will devise a happy ending for him? This is the pathos of celebrity: everyone knows you and admires you, but you remain utterly alone. </p> <p>'I do wish I had another person to share this house with,' he said as his cleaner, having made all its vacant surfaces shine, exited with a witticism and a wiggle, (this being San Francisco, the cleaner has enough attitude for an operatic diva). 'Oh, I guess I share the house with Sophie - just like Prince Edward!' Maupin added with a wink. Jokes are his remedy for the sagging, shuffling depression that always seems about to claim him. Sophie is his mongrel. Barefoot, like an odalisque of a certain age in a sweat suit, he arranged himself on a sofa and cuddled her. </p> <p>He then took me through his emotional history during the past decade, which is recapitulated in his rawly autobiographical Night Listener . 'I'm in a happy state,' he conceded, 'but I'm not euphoric. Being in love is the only transcendent experience.' Nowadays he defines himself as a bachelor, though he fully expected to be a widower. For 10 years he lived with Terry Anderson, who doubled as his business partner, managing a literary enterprise which Maupin, with one of his customary double entendres, calls 'our cottage industry'. Anderson was HIV positive since 1986, so Maupin resigned himself to an inevitable loss. But drugs have controlled Anderson's condition, and he now keeps proud count of his multiplying T cells. In 1996 he decided - this, I repeat, is California - that he 'wanted to explore by himself'. He announced his secession by ritually pierc ing his nose and scrotum. Then he donned a new uniform of padlocked leather, and vroomed off on a new motorcycle. The Night Listener retraverses the breach in almost shaming detail. The narrator is a novelist called Gabriel, patently Maupin himself, while his departed lover Jess is self-evidently Terry. All writers resort to imagination to assuage the pain of reality; Maupin coped with the break-up by writing about it. Terry gave me permission. He encouraged me, even though what I wrote was bound to hurt him, then he brain-stormed the book's promotion. So he'll be coming to England with me on the publicity trip, along with his new boyfriend.' </p> <p>Now 56, Maupin is confronting his own sexual superannuation. Since sex has always been the source of his personal identity, his religious gospel and his forthright, up-front political ideology, it has not been easy for him to find himself sidelined - 'past my prime', as he remarked, 'in the gay world'. It's characteristic of his sweet nature, that the experience should have made him more tolerant, rather than bitter. In 1976 he had a brief affair with Rock Hudson, re-enacted in the forthcoming televised Tales. It broke off when the closeted star insisted he remain hidden. In 1985, just before Hudson's death from Aids, Maupin outed him. 'I'm the age now that Rock was when he picked me up, so I can understand how he felt - how his fame limited his freedom. You get kinder as you go along.' That line of thinking might be his salvation. Isn't retirement from the gladiatorial arena of the disco a relief? Aren't there compensations in increasing age? </p> <p>Slowly, grudgingly, Maupin is coming to accept this, as he reveals in one of The Night Listener 's subplots, which concerns Gabriel's reconciliation with his father. The younger Maupin pilloried his father as 'a homophobic old bastard'. In the novel, he denounces this chilly, bigoted monster all over again, then kills him off. Why not? Fiction permits such acts of vengeance. Except that Maupin almost at once, in a postmodern whimsy, brings his father back to life. It is a brave attempt to resolve the psychodrama between them. He swallowed hard before sending an advance copy to Armistead Maupin Senior, aware that its explicitness about Armistead Junior's sexual tastes would be distressing to an 85-year-old man. 'But he called me when I was in Montreal to say it was my finest book and that it made him proud of me. He tells me he loves me all the time now. I risked being honest, and I got a hug - miracle of miracles!' </p> <p>Maupin's benevolent plotting in the Tales often relied on miracles, more or less plausible. Yet in The Night Listener he lays down his wand. Gabriel becomes obsessed with a young fan he's never met, a child infected with Aids by the father who raped him. It's another Dickensian invention: the boy is Maupin's Tiny Tim. But there is no final blessing. Maupin made me promise not to impart the twist in this plot. Let me merely say that, to his credit, the new book - harsher and morally tougher than anything he's written before, without the sentimental fade-outs built into the Tales - concludes ambiguously. </p> <p>'I guess you could describe The Night Listener as one big ad in the personal columns: \"Middle-aged gay writer seeks buddy for fun times\".' There was a poignant truth to this: all writers address themselves to an imaginary friend, who may or may not be game for more than friendship. 'I'm such a gregarious person,' Maupin continued. 'Not long ago my number was in the phone book. When I get back from this book tour, I'm planning to learn the internet. Maybe I can hook up in cyberspace. There's gotta be someone out there!' </p> <p>Later in the day, having descended the mountain, I thought of him up there in his eyrie, making the best of a solitary sunset and a consolatory video.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Zo\u00eb Robinson: </strong> I was driving home from work as I always do in my Ford Fiesta and coming up a hill about five minutes from my home in Althorne, Essex. Over the crest of the hill was a delivery van coming the other way on my side of the road. We were both doing 45mph, so we had a head-on crash at 90mph. This was May last year. </p> <p>I haven't got any memory from about two weeks before my accident until after I came out of a coma three weeks later. I'm told the other driver was only bruised while I was unconscious in the car. When the air ambulance got there, Barry smashed the back window with his hand to get to me quickly. He then held my airway open for 40 minutes to prevent me choking on my blood and my vomit. Barry says my jaw was like jelly, it had been broken in three places, and I had a big hole in my cheek. Apparently, I was going through my 'golden hour', which meant they had only an hour to save me. When they freed me from the car and flew me to Colchester, I was only minutes from dying. </p> <p>As well as a serious head injury, I broke my right femur, had a big gouge taken out of my right leg, broke my hand, had to have stitches in every finger and my nails were ripped off. But still I feel so lucky to be alive. </p> <p>Recovery has been a very slow process. It's taken months of physiotherapy and I'm still in and out of hospital. I was a hairdresser and I don't know whether I'll ever be able to go back to the salon because I can't stand for long. </p> <p>Barry doesn't usually keep in touch with people he rescues. I sent him and the crew a card thanking them for what they'd done for me, which started the friendship. It was then several months before I was able to meet Barry in person. I just looked at him and thought, that man has saved my life. He gave me some flowers and we got on brilliantly from the start. Since the accident, I haven't been able to cry - I thought I was going to the day I saw Barry, but I didn't. It was emotional inside, though. </p> <p>The accident happened three days after my 21st birthday and I couldn't remember anything of it. So Barry arranged a huge party for my 22nd birthday, with a marquee at the back of my house, a DJ and a cake in the shape of a helicopter. I can't believe he saved my life and was prepared to do all this for me. </p> <p> <strong> Barry Fogg: </strong> We were sitting at the airbase. It was a quietish day and the phone went off with an emergency call. We checked the maps and set off two minutes later. It was a really nasty accident. The front of the car had been pushed right up towards the steering wheel. I said to my colleague, the person in that car is going to be very lucky to survive. We landed five minutes after getting the call. We saw that Zo\u00eb had been submarined from the seat down into the foot well. She had a serious head injury and was choking on her own blood. </p> <p>The main priority was to help her breathe. We couldn't open the car doors, so I climbed through the back window and got behind the driver's seat. The left side of her jaw wasn't there, it was like a bag of jelly. I tilted her head back and opened the airway enough to suck the blood out and clear it. I was doing that while the fire service was busy trying to cut the roof off. I kept thinking how young she was. We finally got her out and into the helicopter, seven minutes later we were at Colchester Hospital, with just minutes to spare. </p> <p>It's not until after the job that your emotions come back. In 14 years, this was one of the worst accidents I've seen. The crew and I sat around analysing things, checking we did all we could. That's our form of counselling. That evening I remember coming home and talking to my wife about it. When I went to bed that night, she was woken by me dreaming that I was choking, gagging, reliving the accident as though I was Zo\u00eb. This was very unusual - I've never had such a connection with a patient before. </p> <p>Working for the ambulance service you become hardened. Your sense of humour changes, too. We'll crack jokes about things that aren't funny to most. It's our way of coping with death. For some reason, with Zo\u00eb, it was different. I wasn't so detached. For weeks after, I kept phoning the hospital to check on her. To hear she'd survived and made such progress was phenomenal. </p> <p>The day we met, I didn't recognise her at first. In the accident, she looked a complete mess. It was an emotional meeting. To say the bottom lip was quivering was an understatement. We've since become close friends. We meet up at fundraising events, I play golf with her dad, her mum rings up for a chat. My young twins have got to know her and there have been tears at bedtime explaining to them what happened. </p> <p>Zo\u00eb's bubbly and outgoing, a breath of fresh air to be around. It seems she's been given another crack at life and she's taking it with both hands.</p>",

When I say that, do you find yourself reflexively pulling in your stomach, puffing up your chest, closing up the back of your neck and contracting your lower back in an uncomfortable facsimile of correct posture? <p>Few of us have been instructed from an early age in achieving optimum physical self-positioning in relation to space and gravity, ie good posture. Hence we have little idea of what it is, how to achieve it or the benefits it bestows. Indeed, any interest taken in attaining it usually comes about when we experience insufferable pain in the back, neck or shoulders, caused by a lack of it. </p> <p>Our technologically oriented culture has us sitting for protracted periods, bent over keyboards, stuffed into car seats and lounging in sofas. Whether you look to the yoga of India or martial arts of the Orient, or to the work of postural correction pioneers FM Alexander, Moshe Feldenkrais and Ida Rolf, it quickly becomes apparent that the reflexive action most of us make when reminded to sit up straight is not the best way to use our bodies. </p> <p>With optimum posture, you can breathe more freely (the first requisite for relaxation and stress control), think more clearly (your head sits lightly on your body) and feel more cheerful (your vital organs have proper space in which to function). But firstly we must develop our propriaceptive sense - the ability to feel from the inside out. Attaining 'the true and virtuous' posture of the Taoists requires thinking yourself into the right shape rather than forcing your muscles to produce it. </p> <p>As you sit now, become aware of your hip region and especially your 'sit' bones, deep within your buttocks. As you breathe in and out, visualise them spreading out sideways. Having mentally broadened your base, visualise your spinal column growing upwards out of your hips, creating the sensation that the top of your head is reaching for the sky. Imagine your skull is a balloon-like vessel filled with helium, elongating your spine. Or picture a silver thread attached at one end to the crown of your head and the other to the ceiling, asserting a gentle upward pull. To assist this lengthening sensation, tilt your sacrum, the triangular bone at the base of the spine, slightly forward. Pay special attention to (mentally) elongating the back of your neck. Now imagine your shoulders and upper back broadening outwards and allow your breastbone to lift and your chin to drop a little. </p> <p>If you've managed to follow that, you should find yourself sitting in optimum posture and may already be feeling lighter, more physically relaxed and clearer headed. Notice how the stress is taken off the trapezius muscles that work so hard holding up the weight of your head. Notice also that your lungs can operate more freely and your organs of digestion are far less cramped. </p> <p>As well as the obvious advantages of increased blood and cerebro-spinal fluid circulation and improved cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive functions, sporting yourself in optimum posture confers not-so-obvious psycho-emotional benefits. With head held high, chest lifted but relaxed and feeling supported by a broad back, it is hard to feel other than totally confident and positive. Negative thoughts literally pull you down. Low self-esteem makes you want to curl up (your spine) and become invisible. By reversing the effect through postural self-adjustment, you also reverse the psycho-emotional cause. </p> <p>Moreover, as we age, we shrink. Succumbing to the pull of gravity, the spine becomes compressed and the torso caves in. By adjusting your posture, you actually regain some level of control over the ageing process. Not that this will happen in one sitting, so to speak. No change worth its salt happens overnight. Lasting change takes diligent, consistent application of the above principles. </p> <p>Many well-trodden paths provide a reliable map or structure to help you achieve this. Alexander Technique is perhaps the most comprehensive approach to postural correction. Rolfing (deep connective-tissue massage) releases blocks in the fascia, or binding of the structure. T'ai chi (which is based on the same principles as is the Alexander Technique) is an effective way to translate good posture into movement, and yoga, the undisputed mother of all exercise, provides the perfect medium for self-correction. </p> <p>I bet by now you're already beginning to slump in your seat again, so let me leave you with those familiar words ringing in your ears: Stop slouching and sit up straight! (Except now you know how to do it.) </p> <p>Dear Doc, How can I drown out the noise of the city? I'm forced to live in London for work and can't get away from it. I've tried white noise machines and whale music, but they don't really help.<br><b> Peter McKay</b> </p> <p>Firstly, let me say you are not forced to live in the city: you choose to, all things considered. Secondly, it is impossible for anyone to drown out noise or mask it for long with recorded sounds. If you are destined to remain where you are, you must surrender to it. Embrace it, in fact. Reframe the noise. The horns, sirens and roaring engines can easily be transformed from cacophony into post-modern symphony. Sounds like you need to make peace with your life as it is.</p> <p>Meantime, extreme sensitivity to noise indicates a deficiency of kidney energy. Take woolfberry tea, massage your kidneys gently with your fists for a few minutes morning and night, and massage your ears with finger and thumb until they grow hot every day. Additionally, cover your ears with your palms (to shut out the noise) and remove them in a close/open sequence 36 times morning and night (this is a martial-art trick). If none of this works - excuse me stating the obvious - use earplugs (New York cops use ones with diaphragms which let all sound in but cut out 6db off the top so as to filter out gunshot noise). </p> <p>\u0095 Barefoot Doctor is author of Handbook for the Urban Warrior and teaches Taoism, meditation, Chinese medicine and t'ai chi.

  "<p>According to Mental Health Foundation figures, one in 20 of us is likely to suffer from 'clinical' depression - that is, serious depression, a disabling disorder including breakdown. At one level, 'breakdown' is one of those words that operates as shorthand; many of us routinely refer to being on the verge of a breakdown when we want to convey just how put upon, stressed and pressurised we are, without really meaning it at all. </p> <p>At a deeper level, though, a nervous breakdown is generally understood to describe a crisis situation; when someone has reached rock bottom and 'broken', in as much as they have ceased to function in a normal way. The details are more difficult - how a breakdown happens, why, and who it is likely to happen to are harder to pin down.</p> <p>There is no textbook experience, as Dr David Bell, consultant psychiatrist and psychotherapist at the Tavistock Centre, confirms. 'Breakdown is a general term that people use to describe a very, very wide variety of experiences.' Still, he feels it is an 'appropriate' word. 'It captures something of the experience,' he says. Despite the fact that, as Dr Massimo Riccio, consultant psychiatrist and medical director of The Priory in Roehampton, points out: 'There isn't really any such thing in medical terms - saying someone has had a breakdown means everything and nothing, and we need a lot more information to fine-tune a diagnosis and make it manageable.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, it is a helpful description for the layman. According to a study earlier this year, more than a quarter of Americans (26 per cent) say they have felt on the verge of a mental breakdown (relationship problems and being a single parent were most often cited as the cause). The study, by a psychologist at Indiana University, represents an increase of 7 per cent since the last similar study 40 years ago, which may not mean that any more of us are suffering from major depressive episodes, just that more of us are willing to admit it's a possibility. Whatever 'it' is. </p> <p>The most common kind of breakdown, according to Dr Philip Timms, a consultant psychiatrist with the South London and Maudsley Trust, is someone developing moderately severe depression, normally over a period of weeks. 'A person would begin to feel more on edge, find it more difficult to sleep, find themselves thinking more negatively about themselves, feel increasingly hopeless and incompetent about what they're doing, and then there comes a day when they just can't face going to work, or getting out of bed, perhaps. Breakdown occurs if a depressive episode is not dealt with - it builds up and it's part of a process.' </p> <p>Ian Ewart, 37, suffered a breakdown last year. He now sees work-related stress as the catalyst. 'Increasingly, I couldn't cope with the pressure. Twelve months to a year before the breakdown, I was having symptoms. I started getting tired, when before I wasn't, unable to deal with stresses that I used to. At that stage, it was a very physical thing that attacked my immune system. I got colds that lingered and lingered and IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). I was always tired. Depressive tiredness is different - you can't cure it through sleep, so you wake up more tired than when you went to bed. </p> <p>'Then I started having panic attacks. I couldn't go into shops because I couldn't stand fluorescent lights or the other people wandering around supermarkets. Getting to work became a nightmare - I couldn't get on the Tube. I felt so run-down I wasn't able to cope with even the basics. I became agoraphobic and more panicky. This is the stage where you should seek help, but I didn't.' </p> <p>Eventually Ewart did go and see his doctor, who told him to take time off work. 'I took two weeks off and just lay in bed. After the two weeks, I still felt bloody awful, but I went back to work and by Monday afternoon I knew it hadn't worked; I was completely unable to handle anything and I had very strange feelings of unreality. I was looking at the office as though I wasn't part of it; I was panicky, shaky and absolutely full of anxiety.' </p> <p>David Bell says that anxiety is central to all breakdown experiences - 'anxiety that has become unmanageable. When you feel anxiety mixed with depression, the result is often terrible vulnerability - people describe being in a room and feeling that others can see right through them. In fact, their boundaries have gone. The ordinary boundaries that keep them functioning.' </p> <p>Ian Ewart stopped functioning after leaving his job and then - temporarily - leaving his partner and son to go and stay in a hotel. 'I still thought I could cure myself, that it was all work related and that I just needed some peace, to cut myself off from everything. But while I was at the hotel I realised how desperate I was; I went to bed and couldn't move because I was absolutely terrified, I felt physically paralysed. I lay like that for two days - I'd try to get out of bed, but my breathing was all over the place, I'd been on the edge for so long. Luckily, I think I knew something of what was happening - when I was 11 years old, I'd read an account of a nervous breakdown, a very dated book now, but nevertheless I was aware. It was hell, though, the worst my life had ever been, and I thought I was dying. Then, at 5am, I managed to move and go home. By 9am, I was at my doctor's, who prescribed an antidepressant called Lustral as well as therapy.' </p> <p>Ewart's breakdown - a collapse in social roles, if you like - is one way to break down; another, according to Oliver James, consultant psychologist and author of Britain on the Couch , 'concerns the question of whether there has been a fissure - a break - in your sense of reality'. In fact, according to James, 'a lot of psychoanalytically minded people would want to introduce that element and say, \"It's not really a breakdown unless the person has actually 'lost the plot', to put it in to ordinary language\" - ie, started to think things are true that are manifestly not true. In other words, the person has become delusional.' </p> <p>Sarah, now 52, has suffered psychotic breakdown on several occasions, that is, she became delusional. 'The first episode was to do with romantic, unrequited love, but also to do with being made homeless at the same time. I was 28. I'd been in a stable relationship for a long time, which I think might have protected me. When it finished, I wasn't able to deal with it, so I latched on to something else. I was delusional and thought that I was in love with somebody and that he was in love with me. </p> <p>'The outward signs of this were that for a while I became a bit manic - I had a kind of heightened energy. But then, when it seemed obvious that the person I'd fixated on wasn't in love with me, I kind of thought, \"Now what happens?\" and became a hypochondriac and thought I was dying. </p> <p>'I also had other delusions that I was an alien; it was quite full-blown psychosis. I could hold a conversation. I carried on, but in the back of mind I'd think, \"Well, actually, I'm an alien.\" The episode didn't last long... several days, or something.' </p> <p>Sarah was treated by a psychiatrist. 'A friend contacted my parents when I thought I was dying and they took me away to see a psychiatrist who gave me anti-psychotic medication, which worked very quickly. It happened again, but in a slightly milder way, about a year later. I think it was when somebody was leaving me and I was also leaving a job, albeit voluntarily. The main symptom was that I thought I was dying again, dying of Aids, which wasn't totally irrational because I'd had a relationship with a bisexual man, but I'd had an Aids test which was negative. The fear might be rational, but what is irrational is the extent to which you feel it. I'd had an Aids test, so why was I still afraid? The last time I was properly delusional and thought I was dying was about eight years ago, when I was evicted from a flat - it's always at times of intense stress.' </p> <p> David Bell feels it is important to see psychotic breakdown as distinct from our normal understanding of a breakdown. 'Psychotic breakdown is obviously different, but isn't always schizophrenia. There are many types of psychotic breakdown, but people tend to have altered experiences defined by losing touch with reality - having delusions and hallucinations and other strange experiences, like travelling on the bus and not thinking, \"I hate it because I think they're looking at me\" but \"They are looking at me.\"' </p> <p>Key to understanding any sort of breakdown is understanding 'why'. Why Ian? Why Sarah? Broadly speaking, experts agree that breakdowns are caused by interaction of the external and internal. Massimo Riccio says that with mental illness, there is always a catalyst. 'Research shows that any mental-health problem is, normally speaking, associated with a life event - the extent to which this event will cause a mental-health problem will vary according to the individual's internal coping mechanism.' </p> <p>In other words, there is an interaction between internal vulnerability and an external event. In fact, according to consultant psychiatrist Dr Cosmo Hallstrom, 'All breakdowns are a function of three interacting factors: genetic vulnerability - what you're born with; then the way you've lived your life - your emotional robustness, and then an interacting event.' Bell feels that given the right - or wrong - set of circumstances, any one of us might break down. 'All of us have our weak spots, our areas of vulnerability that are laid down early in life. If you know your area of vulnerability, you might accept and acknowledge it, but some of us might find our weakness intolerable and try to avoid it.</p> <p>Some of the ways we cope with anxieties are positive and developmental, but others impose a restriction on our personality because they're rather rigid defences. For example, a person might dread vulnerability and so pretend to their partner that they're self sufficient - in other words, they're always acting. This would make them a very controlling person, so when a girlfriend or boyfriend leaves, in addition to the ordinary feelings any of us have, they might feel out of control, overwhelmed with anxiety and vulnerability, and they might break down.' </p> <p>Sarah sees her breakdowns as 'a mixture of circumstance and genetics combined with a highly strung and nervous person; I was weak and also immature - give another person the same stress I had, and I think they would have dealt with it.' </p> <p>Ian Ewart, meanwhile, has traced the seeds of his breakdown directly to childhood. 'I wanted to blame work, but I'd had other depressive episodes before this one. The fact is I'd had a crap upbringing. I always wanted to do creative things, but my father encouraged me into jobs in offices, and because he was a well-known solicitor I was under his shadow. What I really wanted to be was a writer/musician/painter, but I was frightened. I went in to the wrong line of work. Now I know I will never get another office job, and it's such a relief. I do think it's wrong to try and pinpoint one cause of a breakdown, though, when it's often three or four, but in simple terms I would say that my inability to cope with work came from being mentally undermined by my past, which eventually lead to a breakdown.' </p> <p>Even when we've reached rock bottom, though, we don't always act in our best interests. It took Ewart several months to get to grips with his treatment properly, even after he'd accepted that he needed medication. </p> <p>'At first I made a hell of a song and dance about taking the drugs I'd been prescribed. I waited until the following morning to start and then I had a total freak-out because I thought I was having some sort of fit, which was all in my mind. With antidepressants, there's a period when you're still very ill before they kick in - you get panicky about side effects. I think I exaggerated the side effects.</p> <p>Eventually my doctor changed the drug, but even then I wouldn't take the full dose. I took half a tablet for a month to six weeks, so I'd feel good for two or three days, but then have a setback where I couldn't leave the house or something. In the end my partner told me to stop being stupid and I went on the full dose. Within a week, things had changed out of all recognition. Symptoms of anxiety which made me unable to take my son for a walk or go to the shops disappeared and my mood lifted. All the worries and anxieties that had been eating away at me were still present, but it was as if they had been pushed back a couple of metres. l'm still taking the drugs, but I've also had therapy, which was crucial and helped me to totally restructure the way I think and live. I look after my son now for a few days of the week and freelance from home.' </p> <p>Experts agree that it is never right to treat a major depressive episode solely with drugs. 'In the first instance, if I was going mad I would want drugs to help,' says Oliver James, 'but there's a lot of evidence to show that what comes after that is critically important.' Massimo Riccio agrees. 'Medication is never enough - we need to look at a coping strategy, either in group therapy or individually.' </p> <p>Riccio also feels that when it comes to treating mental illness 'there still isn't enough education, so while primary care physicians are educated about mental illness, they are not skilled enough at detection and there is still stigma.' Sarah has come through her breakdowns feeling more scarred by the stigma than anything else. 'I'd had a label attached to me. The actual breakdown wasn't such a bad experience - I wasn't suicidal or a danger to others - so by far the worst thing about it was feeling so stigmatised. When I was first diagnosed, they thought I might be schizophrenic, so I've had that hanging over me, even though another doctor had told me that I couldn't possibly be. Still, the label of schizophrenia has been very, very stigmatising, and it has robbed me of a certain confidence. In terms of work, I've lost 10 years.' </p> <p>Sarah was treated - at various times - using both medication and therapy and nowadays feels 'just better able to cope. I've been in quite stressful situations since - I left my long-term partner and I've suffered as much stress since then as I did at the time of my breakdown - but I'm just better able to cope with it. You just think, \"No, that time before when I thought I was dying I wasn't dying\"; you can think your way out of it rationally.' </p> <p>While no one would recommend a breakdown, David Bell certainly feels that with the appropriate treatment, they can at least be viewed as an opportunity. 'Obviously, what people want when they're in that state is immediate relief, which is perfectly understandable, but when a person has spent their whole life functioning in a particular way, what starts off as a breakdown turns into a breakthrough, if they see someone who is psychoanalytically or psychotherapeutically trained. A well-managed breakdown can give the person an opportunity to really understand what went wrong.' </p> <p>Similarly, Massimo Riccio tells his patients that if they are able to deal with a breakdown successfully it is possible that they will come out the other side a better person. 'I don't advise people to have a breakdown, but once you've been depressed and had one and perhaps had psychoanalytical treatment, you learn about yourself, about your coping strategies, and this will help you to deal with life in a different way.' </p> <p>Ian Ewart remembers reading Dorothy Rowe. 'She says that depression is something that should be welcomed because it's a sign that something needs to change. I think, prior to all this, I'd been stuck in an unhelpful pattern for my entire life.'</p> <p>\u0095 Sarah's name has been changed.</p> <p><strong>Fact from fiction </strong></p> <p>Mental illness is shrouded in myth. Here is the truth about four commonly held 'nervous breakdown' misconceptions:</p> <p><strong>'Nervous breakdown' is a technical term</strong><br> Oliver James says that the term nervous breakdown is devoid of technical meaning. 'It is most likely to have come into use in the First World War as a result of treating shell shock. A lot of our understanding and attitudes to mental illness come from medicine in the military.' Dr David Bell says that the term probably dates back to a time when all psychiatric illness was referred to as nervous disorder: 'It was thought that all mental-health complaints were neurological in origin.'</p> <p><strong>Breakdowns are always 'bad'</strong><br>Most experts agree that breakdowns are not an entirely negative experience - with the right treatment, they can be turned into a breakthrough. As David Bell says, 'When someone has spent their whole life functioning in a certain way, breakdown can be an opportunity for change.' There are also circumstances under which breaking down is an entirely rational response. 'In fact,' says David Bell, 'for some people, not breaking down is a problem.'</p> <p><strong>A breakdown is most likely to occur where there is a genetic predisposition</strong><br> Dr Philip Timms says that although 'depression, like most major mental illnesses, runs in families, genetics doesn't explain all of it.' And, according to Dr Massimo Riccio, even psychotic breakdown could happen to anyone: 'In the general population, there is a 1 per cent lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia.' Oliver James feels that most nervous breakdowns are caused by 'a very poor early infancy, resulting in a very weak sense of self, which, if you like, makes for a much weaker foundation stone.' </p> <p><strong>Breakdowns can't be prevented</strong><br> Philip Timms says that in some cases a breakdown could be avoided if we felt able to take a few weeks out before we reached crisis point. 'It's about the way we organise our lives, about pacing ourselves. There's this notion that we're either fully functional or completely disabled, and people find it hard to deal with the halfway mark.' </p> <p><strong>Warning signs </strong></p> <p>In Positive Under Pressure (\u00a36.99, Thorsons), psychotherapist Gael Lindenfield and stress specialist Dr Malcolm Vandenburg identify the early warning signs of immobilising stress.</p> <p><strong>Physical</strong><br> Includes bowel-related problems, such as diarrhoea and constipation, back pain, migraines, palpitations, breathing problems, disrupted sleep, loss of libido, impotence and, for women, a disrupted menstrual cycle.</p> <p><strong>Emotional</strong><br> Includes worrying all the time, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, out of control, guilty, confused, trapped and unable to know what to do next.</p> <p><strong>Behavioural</strong><br> Includes mood swings, temper loss, preoccupation, inability to tolerate noise, withdrawal from 'normal' life (eg, stopping hobbies), inability to stop moving/fidgeting.</p> <p><strong>Going public</strong></p> <p> When a celebrity's private suffering becomes common knowledge.</p> <p>Stephen Fry walked out of West End play Cell Mates in 1995. 'I would say now it was a breakdown. I don't know precisely what it was. I did see doctors, both the ordinary ones and the psychiatric kind. They said it was a cyclothymic bipolar episode or something like that. That'll do. But one might as well use the language of demonisation. There was a demon of something in me and it took a lot of getting out.' </p> <p>Joanna Lumley on her 1970 breakdown: 'I found everything just unbearable. I'd try to go shopping at Safeway or whatever and couldn't go in, the thought of all the people in there. You'd have to talk to yourself aloud in your head, divide yourself in two and counsel yourself like a friend, so the one you knew would speak in a sensible voice would tell the other one the simplest task they had to do, and the reward would be to go out of the shop and go home.'</p> <p>Brett Easton Ellis had a breakdown after the success of his novel Less Than Zero . 'It was a sort of emotional exhaustion,' he says now. 'My mom came over, I started seeing a shrink, I got my medicine - kind of regulated myself.'</p> <p>PJ Harvey had a nervous breakdown after the break up of her first affair in her early twenties. 'I couldn't do anything for weeks - little things like having a bath and brushing your teeth, I just didn't know how to do it. I never want to go back there again.'</p> <p>Alistair Campbell on his drinking and breakdown in the mid-80s while working on Today newspaper. 'It was a nightmare recovering, trying to re-build my career, while trying to give up drinking. You learn what your priorities are and who your real friends are - and you can count those on one hand... I get letters from people who say, \"I've had a nervous breakdown and it's great that someone talks about it.\"'</p> <p>Peter Mullan on breaking down during his final year in university: 'I was working 15 hours a day, every day, for two months. Then something snapped. I started crying and didn't stop for a week. I had three or four relapses in my twenties. It was very humbling. It was the best and worst thing that ever happened to me. You realise there is a darkness within that you can't always deal with.'</p> <p>Spike Milligan: 'If you've been through a breakdown, it's like having been honed by a very fine Toledo blade.'</p> <p>Bob Hoskins: 'When I separated I had a nervous breakdown because walking away from two kids is a horrific thing. I started living in a kind of bubble, a bubble of grief, because I'd lost my family and couldn't cope... I was having these long sessions with a psychiatrist, then going for a drink with my friend Verity Bargate. She used to say, \"You're telling the psychiatrist all your best plots. You should be doing it on stage.\"'</p> <p>\u0095 The Mental Health Foundation information line is manned Monday to Friday, from 10am-6pm (020 7535 7420).

  "<p>Kerri Sharp has had quite a lot of jobs. She was once a goatherd in Crete: 'I lived in a cave and drank a bottle of brandy a day.' She was once a topless ice-cream seller in St Tropez. There was a brief period as a bus conductor in Torquay and a sojourn in a squat in Stoke Newington screen-printing Anarchy T-shirts for Malcolm McLaren. She was always 'feckin' skint'. </p> <p>Her family were full-on Gypsy Rose Lee travellers with no birth certificates or anything. They finally landed in Leytonstone, east London, though Kerri got out of there fast. 'My father was a singer - grew up with Krays, told stories about spivs, organised crime, Soho, the Messina brothers, prostitution, racketeering... I take after my dad...' Her mother, possibly afraid of this, sent her only daughter to a Catholic convent in Wanstead. 'I loathed that miserable God with his white beard and wagging finger.' </p> <p>It was not the right place for an eight-year-old who stuck nude pin-ups of Marilyn Monroe on the door of her locker and devoted her time to the Rudy Trudies, a club whose sole mission was to go out and find naughty pictures. 'My mother thought I wouldn't get a good education in the local state schools. What I got was an early introduction to sadomasochism.' </p> <p>Caned for spelling mistakes, caned for putting stickers on her briefcase, caned for not wearing a hat in the summer, Ms Sharp emerged with 'unparalleled loathing for authority and a desire to investigate everything that was seen as a sin'. </p> <p>This is a good thing, in general, and particularly useful to her current incarnation, for nowadays, Ms Sharp reigns over Black Lace books, Britain's leading seller of erotic fiction written by women for women. As an imprint of Virgin publishing, Black Lace writhes shamelessly on the huge bed that is Richard Branson's empire. Not all of his 200 enterprises make money, but Black Lace continues to be a success story. Three million books sold to date, in fact. Three million books that describe a vast range of proclivities. Vampires. Nordic gods. Gang bangs. Ice hockey. You name it. </p> <p>Ladies who lust are a faithful market. And a big one. While men will always reach for the top shelf and go for the gyno, women want words, and particularly words that are formed into phrases such as 'rock-hard' and 'Sit on my desk, Sister Clarissa'. Where once the female reader liked to read about kindly Mills &amp; Boon medics living in market towns, now they are absorbed by dark alleys and drag queens. Engagement rings and coy kisses have been replaced by whipping and ramming. </p> <p>'There's nothing wrong with romance,' says Sharp. 'But today's Black Lace books should be primarily concerned with hot, kinky sex, and not be ashamed to explore the filthiest behaviour. Being brave is what it's all about.' </p> <p>Sharp's own sexuality is coloured by adventure, and her love life has been enhanced by exotic scenery. 'I tried to be a lesbian for a year,' she says. 'But you weren't allowed to wear wigs.' Then there was a Rastafarian 'who taught me how to cook' and a man she met down the pub who had long blond hair, looked like a surfer, and spoke like a south London mechanic. 'My god, he was so pretty. He was going like, \"Have you got stockings and suspenders and lovely bras?\" I was like, \"I don't mind dressing up and stuff...\" but he said, \"No, they're for me!\"' </p> <p>Now aged 40, happily single, though in a committed relationship, Sharp has no intention of getting married or having children. 'I'm not a thirtysomething, got a mortgage and a lovely little place in Battersea...' she says. 'You know: waiting for a wonderful man, can't wait to have babies and go on posh holidays to Tuscany, no, no, no...' </p> <p>The libido is a strange thing - don't even pretend you understand it - but as a creative force, it has long been imbued with clear cultural significance, related as it is to everything from legal censorship to progressive thought. </p> <p>The basic symbology of erotica has not changed since John Cleland described the 'delirous transports' [sic] of Fanny Hill in 1748. As the 1959 study 'Pornography and the Law' recorded some basic themes - seduction, defloration, permissive authority figure, rampant hussy and the 'brute' as a sexual symbol - so all these things can still be found in Black Lace narratives. The song remains the same. 'Saving Julie', Catharine McCabe's short story, opens with: 'Reverend Billy Washburn sat at his desk, one hand gently rubbing the erection growing down his long, muscular thigh' - which directly echoes a line in the 1877 classic The Autobiography of a Flea: 'Father Ambrose was the living personification of lust.' </p> <p>Erotic fiction is still rude, but its history has changed. Once the sole domain of male writers, it is now subsumed by the female imagination, and that imagination is purveying that most manly of concepts - sex without emotion. The Black Lace heroine has sex for the sake of it. Sex without commitment. Sex without babies. Sex on Hampstead Heath. She does not get involved. Hell, she hardly hangs around long enough to lace up her thigh-high leather boots. </p> <p>'Black Lace came along at exactly the right time,' says Sharp. 'It succeeded where women's porn magazines failed.' </p> <p>Black Lace was launched in 1993 after a Virgin marketing questionnaire revealed that women wanted kinky erotica that it was possible to buy without embarrassment. An advertisement in The Guardian for 'an unshockable female' produced Ms Sharp. </p> <p>At that point she was working for the glossy fetish magazine Skin Two, having graduated with a BA in film from the University of Westminster. Her heroes were Vivian Stanshall (the comic genius behind the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band) and Luis Bu\u00f1uel, but her belief system had crystallised the evening that she walked into a cinema in 1986 and saw Blue Velvet. </p> <p>'That film inspired me to study surreal directors, and I realised that the perverse subconscious was a valid form of emotional and artistic expression - to me, that is fantastically liberating, because it means living in a state of honesty rather than in a state of chintzy denial.' </p> <p>She settled into the Virgin office, then in Ladbroke Grove, and oversaw the first four books, one of which, Cassandra's Conflict, ignited a furore that ensured the success of the Black Lace series. The tale featured a sadomasochistic relationship, a dark master, a new nanny and an atmosphere of non-consensuality at a time when it was not clearly understood that the rape fantasy was about being overcome by a man of the mind's choice, rather than an actual desire to be maimed by some thug out of a drain in Hackney. </p> <p>'There was a lot of humiliation and violation in it,' says Sharp. 'And everyone went mad, saying, \"How dare you imply that women want to be hurt during sex\" and so on. The Daily Mail accused me of \"corrupting the morals of the nation's women and betraying civilised values\". The result was that they all sold out within a week.' </p> <p>Now, seven years later, Black Lace is respectable. Virgin publish two new novels and one reprint per month, each of which can expect to sell around 10,000 copies in England and America. There are popular collections of short stories and 'specials' are tacked as free gifts on to enlightened magazines, such as New Woman. The readers are from 18 to 40 years old and many of them, for some reason, are nurses. Sharp receives five unsolicited manuscripts a week and at least 10 short stories. She inclines towards writers that show some knowledge of the 'lineage of pulp fiction and cult films', and in general, she likes surprises. </p> <p>'I look for something that isn't an autobiographical piece about splitting up with your boyfriend and getting revenge by discovering your new sexuality,' she says. 'That's dull, and it is 80 per cent of what I get.' </p> <p>The authors range from Janine Ashbless, who composes erotic fairy tales in the tradition of Angela Carter, to 74-year-old Tesni Morgan, who manages to juggle her career with the demands made by nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. </p> <p>'I think erotic stories are enjoyed by career women who are too tired to have any emotional involvement,' Morgan theorises. 'They are often bringing up children on their own. They flop down, exhausted, after a day's work. All they want to do is relax with a glass of wine, and they would prefer to read a sexy book than deal with the stress that goes with a relationship.' </p> <p>Asked to name the writers who best epitomise the mood of the current sexual zeitgeist, Sharp cites Tabitha Flyte and Stella Black. Black has created an eponymous bisexual heroine with a degree from Oxford who wears black stilettos because she likes film noir. She lives in Hollywood, drives a mid-60s Firebird and packs a gun. She indulges in a wide range of postlapsarian pervery, her problems only arriving when she makes the mistake of falling in love. In this, she represents the basic schism that exists in erotic fiction for women: while relational values have always tended to thread through female erotica (and were the very thing that turned The Story of O into a work of quality), so they also impair emotional independence - and emotional independence is useful (if not indispensable) to the woman who wishes to be empowered by transgression. </p> <p>Erotic fiction is about having sex in complicated times. Sexism and body fascism still swamp popular culture and no one bothers to fight it any more. Commerce has won. Professional women undermined by the nesting instinct are in a double bind where the rules of the battle are that there are no rules and no obvious trophy. </p> <p>The result is a psychosexual schizophrenia that is encapsulated in Tabitha Flyte's short story 'The Chef's Revenge', where lewd Tasha 'rapes' a celebrity chef and he repays the compliment by later 'raping' her. It is a classic fable of modernity: lad girl/predator likes it when the man she has undermined turns on her because, in sexual terms, lad girl/predator likes a worthy competitor. </p> <p>'Many women fantasise about being dominated,' says the author, 'but I would only write such a thing in an appropriate context. I think it's really important to write in a way that does not demean women.' </p> <p>Flyte, 29, was born in Southend-on-Sea and read politics at Warwick University. Having worked in Asia for five years, she now lives in Tooting with her boyfriend. 'Most of my friends have read and enjoyed my work,' she says. 'I love telling strangers what I do just to see their faces!' </p> <p>She points out that the men who appear in her books tend to be the kind of men that she likes - that is, they are easy going, open minded and humorous. 'I'm not bothered by what men look like or how much they earn, so my characters tend not to have flash clothes or cars.' </p> <p>Asked if she thinks that erotic fiction is important, she says, 'It is when it shows women's sexuality in a positive light. Rather than portraying women as recipients or passive vessels, good erotic fiction explores their fantasies and show, them to be acceptable. How could this be a bad thing?' </p> <p> Last year, Sharp edited Wicked Words, a collection of erotic short stories that became the first British book to introduce slash lit to mainstream publishing. Slash lit was born at Star Trek conventions and then spread on the net in the Dark Ages when the web was first colonised by Trekkies and pornographers. Female dissidents met in a variety of virtual forums and posted short stories which appropriated mainstream sci-fi characters (in particular Captain Kirk and Spock) and placed them in a homoerotic context. Now a global phenomenon with an infrastructure of hundreds of sites and zines, slash sexualises everyone from Starsky and Hutch to Buffy and Xena. It is a world where a Dalek can date Captain Mainwaring and anything goes. </p> <p>The characteristics of slash fall in line with those demanded by any effective subversive activity. It is a means of expression for the individual (particularly those who feel marginalised); it is a way of undermining the hegemony of corporate concept; it is a completely new and innovative form of literature within the structure of an omnipotent technology; it operates, by and large, outside the demands of profit, which gives it freedom; it is egalitarian - anyone can post their work. </p> <p>Slash lit is the insubordinate's latest chapter to a history that not only relates an intimate relationship between erotica and subversion, but has also proved its political efficacy. The basic nature of slash fiction is illegal (no corporate publisher is going to print rude stories about another corporation's properties) and it is thus confined, but its links to erotic fiction are strong and represented by writers such as Kitty Fisher. Her short story 'Shadowlight' was modified for Black Lace, but reflects the traits of slash in that it is a sci-fi narrative about an affair between two men. </p> <p>Fisher, university educated, 40 years old and living in London, is bisexual and works in management. She has been involved with the slash-lit subculture for eight years and enjoys its renegade aspects. 'It is certainly part of the appeal for me. Going to a slash convention is still a bit like being part of a secret society - all these women from vastly different backgrounds sitting down to discuss whether Mulder would have better sex with Skinner or Krycek.' </p> <p>One of the characteristics of slash, which has yet to be adequately explained, is the fact that it is same-sex fiction (men with men, women with women) written by women for women. The anomalies of this are not simple: it is not just about lesbianism - heterosexual women are also involved. Why, then, are they both inspired and aroused by homo-erotica? This, of course, intrigues culture-studies types, who write long essays about complex pathologies, the creative implications of sexual guilt and the lack of female characters in popular culture. </p> <p>'I don't think any of the theories are quite right,' says Fisher. 'But I do think that women are only beginning to explore their sexuality.' </p> <p>Sharp has long been unafraid to engage herself as a pro-porn voice in the long-running debate that still severs feminist thinkers. 'It's time for women to make a friend of the word pornography,' she says. 'It doesn't have to be a pejorative term.' </p> <p>A couple of years ago she appeared on a David Frost programme and took on Catharine MacKinnon, the influential legal theorist who sees pornography as an engine of inequality that violates human rights. MacKinnon believes that the adult-entertainment industry should be made legally responsible for the damage it is causing. Sharp commented that by repudiating a woman's right to enjoy pornography, MacKinnon was denying the woman's right to have a sexuality, a point for which she received a round of applause from the audience. </p> <p>Sharp's politics were moulded in the mid-80s when, as a reaction against the 'awfulness' of Thatcherism, she became interested in the Socialist Workers' Party. 'I wouldn't dare admit to myself that the whole scene was dreary - those caucus meetings where you'd have Paul Foot and Tony Cliff and the guy who started Rock Against Racism, Paul somebody, who was a dish. But at the end of the day, you would have some terrible gentle beard in corduroys pressing your flesh and talking about Gramsci for 10 minutes. The imagination was not tolerated, there was no room for discussion, and there was no place for an alternative sexuality. It was the same with the unreconstructed feminism that was happening at the same time. It wasn't any fun.' </p> <p>Kerri Sharp's presence at Black Lace means that the imprint is more than a pulp factory churning out saucy books. She understands the subtle ebb and flow of sexual more and tends to steer her authors towards them; where once the narratives were full of pirates and Victorians, now they reflect the post-feminist paradoxes that exist within experimental sex, gender play, office politics and club culture. </p> <p>'The characters are getting older,' Tesni Morgan observes. 'Kerri thinks older women are more interesting...' </p> <p>As female writers continue to explore female sexuality, Black Lace works from within the system to disseminate messages about the joy of unashamed individualism. Ignored by reviews (a promotional tool that pulp fiction has never needed), the writers work in a world of their own. Creating their own cult heroines and spreading lubricious ideas about realistic possibilities, they are a fifth column percolating alternatives in an environment where the overall sexual perspective is still supervised by low-brow yobs.</p>",
  "<p>She was an icon of my early childhood, but then there weren't many heroines on early-evening TV in the mid-60s. There was sensible auntie Valerie Singleton and her sticky-backed plastic. There was an assortment of inanely grinning women with their hands up glove puppets. And then there was Lady Penelope, London agent for International Rescue and the real star of Gerry Anderson's Thunderbirds . She only had one serious rival in my eyes, but although Stingray 's heroine Marina swam beautifully, in the end she was just too dumb to emulate. Not daft, you understand, just dumb. The mermaid didn't speak. </p> <p>Lady Penelope, on the other hand, spoke beautifully. Always cool under pressure, her cut-glass English accent was faultless, as were her manners. She never failed to praise her adenoidal chauffeur sidekick after another successful mission with a warm, calm 'Parker, well done!' and he never failed to know his place. She was always 'M'lady', even when they were shooting up the bad guys. More hit woman than It Girl, Lady Penelope had style: the immaculately coiffed blonde hair, the perfectly shaped sugar-pink nails, the smart trouser suits and, most of all, the pink retro Rolls-Royce with the gun concealed in the grille. Compared to her, the rest of the cast of her long- running show - those wholesome Tracy brothers and their insufferably smug father - seemed a little, well, wooden. </p> <p>Why the reminisces? Well, you may already know that Lady Penelope is back. BBC2 is showing a digitally remastered version of Thunderbirds at 5.25pm on Sundays. But Lady Penelope's spirit is also influencing the collections creeping into the shops now, with some of the models in the autumn/winter catwalk shows looking shockingly ladylike and polished in demure-looking slim-fit coats (Marc Jacobs), tailored trousers, full-length macs, tailored hound's-tooth coats (Markus Lupfer), suits in tweed (Narciso Rodriguez, MaxMara) and cashmere (Clements Ribeiro), and scarves clasped round necks (Celine). Tousled hair was replaced by smooth chignons, make-up was more Grace Kelly than Siouxsie Sioux, and glittery brooches featured everywhere. It was a touch of class on the catwalk after a long period of floaty, unstructured clothes, and in a four-page feature in this month's British Vogue has hailed the return of the proper madam. </p> <p>The evidence seems clear: It Girls gathering in the ladies' room at Claridges; the trend for more feminine, floaty interiors as seen in Ian Schrager's latest London hotel, The Sanderson; the return of the acronym NSIT among girls (to indicate ungallant men who are Not Safe In Taxis); the boom in books on modern manners; cheaper, faster US-style nail shops finally making regular lunch-time manicures accessible for working women; matching shoes and handbags being pushed in luxury leather stores for the first time in years. For proof that this is more than just a glossy-fashion fiction, look no further than this year's Burberry boom: one minute it's a brand for the country set and upmarket Americans, next it's being worn by Meg Mathews and coveted by the club set, and slight variations on its distinctive check pattern are currently gracing the windows of high-street fashion stores throughout the land. </p> <p>Yet before you go rushing to Herm\u00e8s for your headscarf, perhaps you should check your irony levels. Fashion runs in cycles, and it may well be time for a little more polish and refinement. But gone are the days when Paris could decree that hemlines were up and women across Europe would dutifully take out their sewing machines to comply. Instead, we take looks from the catwalk, the high street and the second-hand shop and mix them together in our post-modern dressing-up box, rifling through different looks, eras and attitudes to fit our mood. So it is that the same issue of Vogue also has features on the return of the playboy (a man who is always NSIT), the revival of 80s style, a story updating 70s punk looks, plus a very sensible warning from buyer Joan Burstein of Browns about the new trend for ladylike tailoring: 'People have really appreciated the sense of freedom in dress, and they are not going to give that up.' </p> <p>So it may be that this winter we'll flirt with twin-sets and pearls, wear tailored skirts and two-piece suits to work and play, even buy matching shoes and bags for the first time in years. We may be once, twice, three times a lady, but in between we can also be rock chicks, disco dollies, boho hippies, even track-suited slobs. Unlike Lady Penelope, there are no strings on us.</p>",
  "<p>The change in Jay McInerney's life is apparent as soon as you enter his apartment. It is in one of those discreetly expensive Upper East side townhouses off Central Park, with a liveried doorman and a creaking panelled lift. The whole building reeks of old money and conventional mores - not exactly McInerney's natural habitat. The apartment contains a few pieces of antique furniture - a bookcase, a sofa, a table - and one or two silver-framed photographs of his parents, his children, his wife's horse. But the air is stale and the room is dusty and underfurnished, with marks on the walls where pictures once hung. I guess, even before he tells me, that the apartment is up for sale. </p> <p>'This is sort of a relic,' he says, looking round the empty walls. 'Helen decided it's better for the kids to live in the country, so she's taken them back to Tennessee and I'm selling this and moving downtown. Downtown is better for me - I find myself going there every night anyway. This is more of a family place.' He speaks so flatly I wonder at first if he is drugged or hungover. But he is, I think, just very unhappy. His third marriage, to his Southern belle, Helen Bransford, is over. It lasted nine years - longer than any of his previous relationships - and made him a father for the first time. But now, at 45, and beginning to look it, he is footloose again. </p> <p>His new collection of short stories is called How It Ended - but it is not about the end of his marriage to Helen Bransford. Most of the stories were written several years ago - even the one that seems to be about Bill Clinton was written before Clinton was anywhere near the White House. He says he thought of putting dates on the stories, 'But the nice thing is that people don't seem to necessarily know that they weren't all written recently. I've published 20 or 25 stories in magazines over the years, and ultimately these were the only ones that I thought were durable. I'm not saying they're all of Joycean quality, but at least I feel confident that they're the best I've done. A few of them are new - the newest is 'Third Party', written this year. My agent said, \"God that's the way you were writing 15 years ago - grow up!\"' </p> <p>That was slightly my reaction to 'Third Party' too, but I'm surprised that he says it. Usually he is brilliant at hyping his work, but today it's as if he can't quite get his act together. He apologises, 'I'm just figuring this out as I go along. I haven't really talked about this book.' He doesn't even seem to have looked at it - 'What's that car doing on the cover?' he asks. 'It's not exactly my department is it?' No indeed - he is not a great car writer in the Martin Amis or Will Self league; in fact I can't remember any great automotive moments in the McInerney oeuvre. His forte is relationships, especially - as in these stories, as in his life - failing or failed relationships. </p> <p>How It Ended is not even being published in the States, because many of the stories were included in the American edition of Model Behavior, published two years ago. The New York Times praised the stories, but Model Behavior was generally panned. These days, he says - again with unusual self-deprecation - his literary reputation is 'balanced on a knife edge'. This isn't quite true, but the general American view is that he has never lived up to the gigantic promise of his first novel, Bright Lights, Big City in 1984, when he was hailed as 'the next F Scott Fitzgerald'. It didn't help that the 1988 film of Bright Lights, Big City was a turkey, largely because Michael J Fox was cruelly miscast as the hero. But mainly his literary reputation has been cluttered, confused and ultimately damaged by his gossip-column celebrity. In New York in the 80s, it seemed you couldn't open a newspaper or magazine without seeing a picture of him at the latest nightclub with the latest model draped on his arm. </p> <p>He loved it at the time, but now he thinks it damaged him. 'If there is a way in which I have had a more difficult time with monogamy and a quiet life than the average person, I think that, you know, the success of my first book was very disruptive. I felt incredibly lucky at the time and for a long time afterwards, but it unsettled my life in a way that I only now realise. It opened so many doors, and I got so much attention that it couldn't help but spoil me somewhat.' The other night he was having dinner with Bret Easton Ellis, and Ellis recalled something he had forgotten - that they went to a movie premiere together in about 1987, and the photographers were so desperate to get a shot of Jay with his new girlfriend Marla Hanson, that they ended up punching Ellis's girlfriend to the ground and trampling her underfoot. 'That's how crazy it was - it was a really ugly scene. That's why I needed to get out of New York for a while. I was burned out. It was not a sane or reflective existence toward the end. I didn't know whether the escape would be permanent - it turned out that I just needed a break.' </p> <p>The 'break' was marriage to Helen Bransford, and moving to Tennessee. But now that, too, is over. This again raises the question always asked by Jay-watchers: is he really a good boy pretending to be bad, or is he actually as bad - as callous and brattish - as he can sometimes seem? Naturally he has always favoured the former view, and said two years ago, 'I think I've been trying to prove I'm a really bad guy for 20 years, that I'm not a mother's boy. But part of me is stuck with being a Catholic boy who is slightly shocked by things.' Part of him - but perhaps a decreasing part. He once admitted that, as a teenager, he was deeply influenced by the Playboy 'Adviser' section and he still retains that slightly tacky notion of sophistication - he really has to have a beautiful woman on his arm. And the emotional detritus is piling up. </p> <p>He says he's not behaved so badly. 'I don't think I've left a trail of weeping women in my wake. I mean, the number of serious relationships I've had has not been into double digits. Merry [his second wife] once said I was a very dangerous man, but I don't know many people who would agree with her. I think I have a much more tempestuous and eventful amorous life than the average middle-class citizen, but I wouldn't agree that I necessarily behaved dishonourably. The score is about equal between me and the opposite sex!' </p> <p>Perhaps. His first wife, Linda Rossiter, was a half-Japanese model whom he met when he was living in Japan on a Princeton scholarship. The marriage lasted for precisely four months - she went off to the Milan collections and never came back. Then in 1981, while studying at Syracuse under Raymond Carver, he married a PhD student called Merry Reymond. He was still living with her when Bright Lights, Big City was published in 1984, and changed his life. He claims that no one thought he was handsome till he became a famous writer, but suddenly every door in New York was open to him, everyone was offering him cocaine, and models were passing him their phone numbers. It was exciting for him but confusing for Merry: 'She married a graduate student and woke up married to an MTV star.' </p> <p>In 1987 he left her for a model, Marla Hanson, who was then headline news as a result of having had her face slashed by a mugger. Merry suffered acute depression, attempted suicide, and was in a psychiatric hospital for nine months. He paid the enormous bills, which wiped out his earnings from Bright Lights, and said, 'Yeah, I did feel guilty, but I paid a lot of money to expunge the guilt.' One of the best stories in How It Ended seems to relate to this period. It is about a famous actor going to visit his estranged wife in a psychiatric home, and wondering why he keeps delaying their divorce. 'Sometimes he suspected he was afraid to let go because she was the only person who wouldn't allow him to reinvent himself completely, into something bright and shiny and superficial... [She] was perhaps his best chance to remember and preserve the best of what he had been.' </p> <p>So he was slow to divorce Merry and never got round to marrying Marla Hanson, though they stayed together for four years. He remembers it as 'a very obsessive relationship, throwing glasses at each other, cheating on each other. It was very exciting.' But she left him in 1991, walking out with her portfolio and her diaphragm, just like his first wife. Within days, he rang an old friend, Helen Bransford, asked her out, and suddenly they were in love and married three weeks later at City Hall. She came from a very grand old Tennessee family (the family seat, Belle Meade, is now a museum) and he seems to have fallen in love with the South as much as with her. They bought a country ranch near Nashville, and he signed off from New York with his big valedictory novel Brightness Falls . His next novel, The Last of the Savages, was set in the South, and the interviews he gave on publication were all about horses, heirlooms, ancestors, and revealed a hitherto-unsuspected vein of snobbery. He claimed, 'I always wanted to live in the world that I have ended up living in.' </p> <p>But the Tennessee idyll was already flawed. Helen was 43 when they married - seven years older than him - and warned him that they might not be able to have children. He said he honestly didn't mind. But when she became pregnant within weeks of marrying him, he seemed to share her delight. Then she had a miscarriage. Then she had four more miscarriages. Then she turned to IVF. But her eggs were too old, and her uterus too old to carry the baby to term. Most women, I imagine, would have given up at this point, but she didn't. A friend of hers called Jesse, a country and western singer, offered to donate eggs, and Helen advertised for a surrogate mother to carry the baby. She found a waitress who was willing to do it for $15,000. Thus, with Jay's sperm, her friend's eggs, and her employee's womb, Helen created the twins, Maisie and John Barrett McInerney III. But it was touch and go. The waitress refused to give up smoking, much to Helen's fury, and then developed diabetes and kept going into labour. The twins were eventually born three months prematurely, weighing less than 2lb each, and had to spend 10 weeks in incubators. Helen wrote a gripping account of the whole saga for American Vogue. </p> <p>Jay's role at first was hardly more than sperm donor and bemused spectator. He'd always assumed he would be a father one day, but he was in no hurry. 'I never really cared that much. I just didn't get it until I saw them [the twins] and held them and got to know them.' The twins were born in 1995, the year he turned 40, and lost his own father - it should have marked the end of his long restless adolescence. </p> <p>But the next year there was an odd little warning sign that all was not quite perfect in the marriage. Helen had a facelift. She decided to do it, she said, because when Jay came back from interviewing Julia Roberts he remarked, 'I told her all about you. Well, everything but your age.' It was the first sign, to Helen, that the seven-year age gap was a problem - a problem for Jay, she thought. So off she went and had a facelift, and wrote an article, and then a book, about it. Jay said he felt 'a little embarrassed. But I have to say that I've benefited from it. She looks great, as good as she did when I first met her 14 years ago.' </p> <p>He once said that what attracted him to Helen was that 'She was so cool, like a guy.' She was the first woman he'd lived with who was not emotionally needy or wounded in some way. 'And,' he now adds, 'who wasn't emotionally unbalanced. Maybe that's one of the reasons why our separation is so amicable. She's not threatening to stab me in my sleep or stab any future girlfriends in my life!' </p> <p>But surely having a facelift and going to all those lengths to have children suggest that she was needy, or at least that she was worried about ageing? 'Well. I never quite understood those decisions. Neither of those decisions were pacts that I was in agreement with. Those were not moments of great concord , so I don't know how to answer for those decisions. Helen is a great eccentric - and I say that affectionately. I don't think anyone else would have had quite that response to that set of problems.' </p> <p>Significantly, his next novel, Model Behavior, published in 1998, was set again in New York and marked what one critic called 'a return to the shallow end'. He had grown bored with country life, and was spending more and more time in their New York apartment, so eventually Helen moved there with the twins, bought an adjacent apartment (from Stephen Fry, who seldom used it) and tried to make a family home. Helen said it was fine for him to go out partying till three in the morning, as long as he didn't expect her to accompany him. </p> <p>Inevitably, this soon provoked rumours that Jay was having affairs, though he insists that's not the reason they split up - 'We were having our own problems, all by ourselves.' One basic problem was that Helen wanted to be in Nashville and he wanted to be in New York. Helen had done New York in her twenties and thirties and wanted to get out - 'She didn't feel she needed all the social desperation, I guess.' Whereas he felt he belonged - 'It's my place, you know? It's the only place I've ever felt entirely at home. There's a wonderful fantasy element to life in Tennessee, and it was something I wanted to try but I don't think it was ultimately the life for me.' </p> <p>They officially separated earlier this year, but Jay says the real crisis was last year. Of course, he'd been through divorce before, but not when there were children. 'Children change everything,' he sighs. 'That's what makes it essentially really awful - that was what gave us both such trouble and regrets. And the resolution is somewhat melancholy, but at the same time I'm so relieved that there is some resolution, and so is Helen. We both get along much better now - we started as really great friends and that's what we've reverted to, and it seems to work very well.' He visits the children two or three times a month and recently went on holiday with them. The other day he accompanied Helen to a party in Nashville, which he says shocked some of their friends. Jesse, the biological mother of the twins, is still angry with him. 'She might be a little down on me - one always has to blame somebody - but I think she'll get over that. Because Helen is so incredibly non-judgemental that her friends are coming around now.' </p> <p>But last year, he says, was 'a terrible, terrible year for me'. What made it so terrible was that he suffered writer's block - something that had never happened to him before and that he thought never would. 'With so much of my life in turmoil, I just couldn't settle in a place where I could concentrate. I couldn't get enough distance when my mind was so consumed by this life crisis, and I was really stuck for a while. I'm very happy that's over.' </p> <p>Actually, even blocked, he managed to write a short story, a film script, a wine column, a travel piece about Cuba, and a brilliant non-fiction piece for The New Yorker about his mother's death. She died in 1979, and of course her death formed part of the hinterland of Bright Lights, Big City, but this time he wrote more nakedly of the last three days he spent with her and her deathbed confession that she had not been quite the model Catholic wife she appeared to be - she had committed adultery, at least in her heart. It was as if, by giving him her 'sin', she absolved him of some of his guilt.</p> <p>The piece was much admired by readers - but not by his mother's friends and not by his two brothers, one of whom refused to speak to him for a year. 'I got a lot of questions about, \"Why would you do this? Why would you hold our mother up this way?\" and of course the answer is: because I'm a writer - and I'm hardly the first writer to have come up against this problem. There's a terrible way in which being a novelist or a memoirist is a question of constantly betraying the deepest confidences of those around you. So, yes, it was tough. It was tough to come up with an answer for my brother - Why did you do it? Well - because I had to. That's what I do . And this is my way of dealing with it - I've been living with it for a long time. And ultimately I fell back on the old excuse that it was my form of therapy.' </p> <p>Of course, as he says, many writers are guilty of using their friends and family as material. But he seems to do more - he actually seems to live his life in order to fuel his writing, grabbing experiences wherever he can, and at whatever cost to other people. Thus, Nashville was a useful interlude to give him some Southern background and enable him to see New York with fresh eyes, and having children was useful in all sorts of ways. He used to fear the pram in the hall, but now he thinks children are a great bonus for a writer because a) they give you new access to your own childhood memories b) they enable you to watch the development of language and c) they make you think in a bigger time scale, whereas before he never thought further ahead than 'Where am I having dinner tonight, and will I get a good table?' </p> <p>When he talks like this, it sounds callous and he seems to agree it is callous. 'I'm afraid that - not necessarily deliberately, but consistently - I've made a kind of laboratory out of my life, where I mix the stuff in the test tubes to create explosions - possibly resulting in interesting by-products. I mean, not deliberately - I'd be crazy to deliberately do that - or maybe not. But it sometimes appears to be part of a plan. Flannery O'Connor once said that anybody who had a childhood has enough to write about, and she lived on her little farm, not leaving the house for months at a time, and she wrote better than I probably ever will. But I do think that diversity and range of experience can't help but make me a more interesting novelist. There is a type of writer that can happily bury themselves in the country and dig very deep, but I'm not like that.' </p> <p>So what next? He is back in the bright lights, big city, presumably chasing models and partying hard - though he is off the Bolivian marching powder these days. He claims there is no new girlfriend - though that seems unlikely - and that, anyway, he is in no hurry to get divorced. But most importantly, he has a new novel on the go, and this is the big one, he believes, perhaps even big enough to justify all the heartaches of the past year. He wrote his way out of his block by starting a novel about a marriage breakup 'since that was all I could think about at the time', but now the novel has developed and diverged to the point where he might omit the marriage breakup entirely. </p> <p>Suddenly, talking about his new novel, he seems really fired up for the first time. He says he mustn't talk about it - he knows the rules of publicity, he's supposed to be plugging How It Ended - but he can hardly stop himself. It's about the film industry, set in New York, Los Angeles and Rome, and deals with the collision between art and commerce. His personal life might be in chaos, but he almost doesn't care - 'All I know for certain is that I'm in transition and surely this metamorphosis must be bringing me a little closer to my mature form. So now: if I can just write a really good new novel, that's my main goal for the next year. And I'm hoping that other things will take care of themselves. As long as my kids are happy. And it's a big novel.'</p> <p>\u0095 How it Ended by Jay McInerney (\u00a312.99, Bloomsbury) is out on 18 September.</p>",
  "<b> Moo-who? </b> It's pronounced 'moo-ick.' And if you don't know him, you might be aware of his late father. <p><b> His Dead Dad? </b> Yep - a scaled-down, super-realistic sculpture of his father's corpse. It was the sensation of the Royal Academy's Sensation show, knocking the dissected livestock and sexed-up tents into a cocked hat. 'I never saw my dad's body after his death, so this was my way of saying goodbye,' he explained.

  "The relationship between humans and dogs goes back 15,000 years and is especially close in Britain - after all, our national identity is summed up by the bulldog. Dogs are workers, companions, guides, show-stealers (Eddie in Frasier ), PR opportunities (Peter Mandelson and Bobby), accessories and metaphors. <p>Your choice of dog says a lot about you and your lifestyle. Want to look a little like a bit of a geezer? Get a bull terrier. The only acceptable choice for a weekend's shooting? A black Labrador. Want to look insecure? Buy a pair of Rottweilers. </p> <p>Some charities that train dogs for disabled people actually give away dogs that fail to qualify. But if you chose not to adopt a rescue dog, your major expense will be the dog itself. Pedigrees can cost anything from \u00a3150 for a West Highland terrier to \u00a31,000 for a bulldog. Popular golden retrievers are about \u00a3400, while Old English sheepdogs are at least \u00a3500. A pedigree dog may already be registered with the Kennel Club - if not, this will be \u00a350. </p> <p>It is also essential to insure your dog - about \u00a3200 per annum will cover all vet fees. A less comprehensive policy won't include vaccinations (up to \u00a370 each in London, \u00a330 elsewhere) or little necessities such as worming tablets. </p> <p>If you want to enjoy foreign holidays together, you'll need a new pet passport, which means meeting strict criteria: microchipping your dog will be \u00a320, and the total cost of the passport will be about \u00a3200. Feeding your new best friend can be expensive. A 15kg sack of dry food is about \u00a315 (or \u00a3100 annually). Canned food is more expensive, but don't ask what goes into it. Other essentials are a collar and lead and bedding, such as a beanbag. In the early days, there might be a little damage as your puppy learns right from wrong: in a worst-case scenario, you could lose a favourite armchair. </p> <p>Cats, on the other hand, are an entirely different matter. What do we associate with them? Witchcraft and bad luck. They have always been thought of as fickle, devious narcissists. And rightly so.</p> <p><b> Dog from </b> \u00a30 to \u00a31,000 <br> <b>Insurance </b>\u00a3200 per year <br> <b>Vaccinations from </b>\u00a330 <br> <b>Passport </b>\u00a3200 <br> <b>Identification microchip </b>\u00a320 <br> <b>Food </b>\u00a3100 per year <br> <b>Collar and lead </b>\u00a315 <br> <b>Puppy training course </b>\u00a345</p>",
  "<p>If the Conservatives come to power, just about every man, woman and child should soon feel the financial effects. Last week's Tory pre-manifesto policy document, 'Believing in Britain', is heavily skewed towards financial reform. </p> <p>Many of the changes would be extremely tough - the 'Can Work, Must Work' policy, for instance, would ensure that those who can work do so or lose unemployment benefit'. This may sound fair, but anyone who is familiar with the 'all works test' for Incapacity Benefit knows how difficult it is to tell whether a person's back pain or depression is genuine or exaggerated. </p> <p>Then there is the proposal that lone parents whose children are at secondary school must seek work. Many of these parents are themselves eager to find employment, but the danger is that some who have good reasons for not wanting a job will be forced to take one. </p> <p>The document, which is certain to be adopted at next month's Conservative party conference, gives scope for some back-pedalling on recent employment law reforms: 'We will remove some burdens altogether from small business.' </p> <p>As one would expect from a Tory party moving further to the right, there is a growing emphasis on self-provision and a repugnance for big government. So schools and universities will have greater power to run their own finances, successfully or not. And, similarly, younger people will be given the option to run their own state pension funds. </p> <p>Instead of the current system of paying towards the basic state pension by making National Insurance contributions, people would be allowed to pay that money into a private pension instead. The attractiveness of this proposal will depend largely on more detailed issues - the help provided to people whose investments let them down, for instance. The Tory team suggested last week that they would be guaranteed help. </p> <p>Pensions specialist Raj Mody of actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow says: 'The question for individuals is whether taking this option would give you a better deal - and that is a very complicated assessment to make.' </p> <p>The financial proposals in 'Believing in Britain' cover a wide spectrum of issues. They include plans for the Tories to: </p> <p>\u0095 Be a tax-cutting government - 'in all normal circumstances we will reduce the burden of taxation'. This is a step back from William Hague's controversial guarantee to cut taxes, which the party is not now sure it could deliver. </p> <p>\u0095 'Set a low target for inflation', with the aim of maintaining low interest rates and a stable economy. </p> <p>\u0095 Keep Britain outside the Single European Currency 'throughout the Parliament', rather than taking the possible Labour route of holding a referendum on British membership. </p> <p>\u0095 'Plan for increases in public spending above inflation on a sustainable basis.' </p> <p>\u0095 'Simplify taxes including VAT. We will send every taxpayer a clear statement of how the Government raises and spends its money.' </p> <p>\u0095 Reintroduce the married couples' income tax allowance. </p> <p>\u0095 Introduce 'family scholarships' to help parents retrain and return to work after looking after children. </p> <p>\u0095 Reform the 'IR35' rules under which many self-employed information technology consultants are now taxed as staff employees. </p> <p>\u0095 Encourage 'new ladders of ownership' for council tenants and people on low incomes to buy their own homes through schemes such as 'rent to buy'. </p> <p>A notable omission from the document is long-term care - an encouraging sign for the Government, whose legislation on this issue may have an easier ride when it reaches Parliament, probably in the coming session.</p> <p><strong>Liberal help pledged to elderly </strong></p> <p>Elderly people would benefit significantly from measures proposed in the Liberal Democrat mini-manifesto, 'Freedom in a Liberal Society', also out last week. Charles Kennedy's party would 'significantly increase the basic state pension, make extra payments to the over-75s and over-80s...' and 'abolish means-testing on savings'.</p> <p>This last commitment - if it included all assets within the definition of savings, as the Government currently does - would prevent elderly people having to sell their homes to go into homes. It has to be admitted, however, that the Lib Dems are unlikely to win the next general election. Even so, if they got large support for this sort of policy, they may decide to campaign on it.</p> <p>Other financial measures proposed last week include:</p> <p>\u0095 A 50p rate of tax on earnings of more than \u00a3100,000 a year and, 'if necessary', an extra 1p on basic-rate tax for education.</p> <p>\u0095 Gradually dropping the 10p tax rate to zero, helping 1.4 million people.</p> <p>\u0095 Taxing Child Benefit at 40 or 50 per cent in homes where one parent is a higher-rate taxpayer.</p> <p>\u0095 Raising this benefit for children aged under five.</p> <p>\u0095 A 'new universal compulsory and personal Owned Second Pension Account'. All earners would make their own contributions; the Government would make payments for the sick, unemployed and carers.</p> <p>\u0095 An annual review of the national minimum wage.</p> <p>\u0095 Allowing people to go on working after 60 or 65.</p> <p>\u0095 Fighting bank closures by making firms consider their 'social obligations'.</p> <p>\u0095 Hints of gay equality measures that could ultimately include treating homosexual and married couples the same on, for instance, Inheritance Tax.</p>",
  "<p>Around 7 million of us around Britain participate in some kind of boating activity each year. And this number is growing, according to the British Marine Industries Federation. </p> <p>A record 118,000 people visited last year's Southampton Boat Show, and if the weather holds, the organisers expect even more to attend this year's event, which starts on Friday. </p> <p>Southampton has a big advantage over the London Boat Show in that prospective purchasers can take a boat out for a test sail. 'Everything is there,' says Joe Field of Navigators &amp; General Insurance. 'You can sign up for a boat, sort out the finance and insurance and get fully kitted out all in one day. All you need to bring is your chequebook.' </p> <p>But before anyone gets carried away imagining the wind in their hair and the tang of salt in their nostrils, it's as well to think seriously about how much life on the ocean wave is going to cost. </p> <p>Boats ranging in price from \u00a3300 up to the Sun seeker 105 at a cool \u00a34 million-plus are on show in Southampton. But there is a healthy secondhand market, which can be reached through a boat broker or advertising in trade magazines. Brokers automatically check things such as who legally owns a boat that is for sale and whether there is any outstanding debt on it. Private buyers need to do the same. </p> <p>Shoppers wanting to spend a lot will find a number of specialist marine finance companies offering special boat-buying packages. They include Capital Bank, Lombard North Central and Mercantile Credit. Typical charges are 11 per cent APR for a \u00a320,000 unsecured personal loan to 9.9 per cent APR for a marine mortgage of the same size. </p> <p>You will want to insure your boat. This is not a legal requirement, but there could be problems mooring it if you don't have a policy. Cover for a small dinghy costs between \u00a340 and\u00a350 a year, including theft, damage in the dinghy park or on the water, vandalism and third- party claims. </p> <p>'Most claims are for theft after break-ins at the moorings or in yards,' says Field. 'You don't see too many write-offs or thefts of the boats themselves.' </p> <p>Mooring fees are another expense. Recent marina developments mean moorings are more plentiful today than 10 years ago, but there is still pressure in some of the more desirable locations. </p> <p>All three marinas owned by MDL on the river Hamble in Hampshire are full and there is a waiting list, says marketing director Helen France. Elsewhere, things are easier. A pontoon mooring on the East coast costs about \u00a3235 per metre of your boat's length per year. A swinging mooring (to a midstream buoy) would cost \u00a3205 per metre. </p> <p>Beginners can take time over buying the latest electronic navigational gear, but it is essential to kit yourself out properly. You probably don't need the world's most expensive boat shoes - prototypes made of hi-tech materials for Pete Goss, skipper of the Team Philips round-the- world catamaran, at \u00a335,000 a pair - but you will need a decent waterproof jacket and trousers and suitable shoes. Lifejackets are also essential, so you are probably talking about a minimum outlay of around \u00a3300. </p> <p>Finally, you will need to be able to sail. Five-day beginners courses in dinghies, to Royal Yachting Association recognised standards, are available all over this country and abroad. They cost between \u00a3250 and \u00a3300 for a residential course. 'Competent crew' courses for yachtsmen and women cost about the same. </p> <p>James Stevens, the RYA's training manager, says: 'Sailing for the beginner can be pretty miserable. It's much more fun if you learn to do it properly.' </p> <p>So having exhausted at least one chequebook, is it all worthwhile? Most British enthusiasts would probably agree with Stevens' verdict: 'There is nothing like it in the world.' </p> <p> The Southampton show runs from 15 to 24 September.

  "<p>Last August, my wife and I bought two sofas from Courts on a one-year interest-free option. This was a \u00a31,204 credit arrangement with HFC Bank, paid through 12 small monthly instalments, with a lump sum payment at the end of the year. </p> <p>Recently we received a statement noting an outstanding balance of \u00a365.40 for credit protection insurance, which HFC said I had taken out with the original credit agreement. I checked the application form. There was no tick and I had written 'N/A' next to the box. </p> <p>I had completed this form in the shop, where I was also given a personal loan voucher, completed by a Courts employee, which I signed, assuming it just repeated my application form. I now see that the insurance box on the voucher had been ticked. </p> <p>I don't doubt for a minute that I was wrong not to be more vigilant in checking what I signed, but surely I am being askedto pay for someone else's error?<br><strong>JM, London</strong> </p> <p>HFC says the two forms refer to applications for two different types of credit, but the deal was that you took both. The form you completed yourself was for a Courts store card, which you threw away; the other, for the personal loan, had the ticked insurance box. </p> <p>The salesman should have assumed you wanted identical conditions, or at least checked with you, but he earned no financial incentive by ticking the box on your behalf. </p> <p>HFC is happy to accept that you did not want the insurance and has cancelled the policy. You have paid for the sofas in full, and will not get caught by interest charges. </p> <p><strong> AA membership: Unused cover</strong></p> <p>On 3 April, I sent a cheque for \u00a375 to renew my AA membership, due at the end of April. But before the end of the month, I bought a new car that included three years' AA cover. </p> <p>I asked for a refund but was told that subscriptions are accepted for 12 months' continuous membership and are not refundable. Can you help me obtain my \u00a375, which I feel the AA is retaining on rather shaky arguments?<br><strong>WB, Harrogate</strong> </p> <p>Older AA membership cards show the exact day for renewal, but current ones indicate only the month and year. So, although you believed your subscription ran to the end of the month, the AA says it was due on 20 April, and you telephoned to cancel on the 28th. </p> <p>The money would have been refunded if the year had not yet started, but no refunds are allowed once it has. The only consolation is that the AA defers the unused portion until you want to reactivate it, so you will get 358 unused days of the subscription at this year's rate, however much the fee has increased. </p> <p><strong> Cooling off: The cold reality</strong></p> <p>I took out an Aberdeen unit trust Isa for \u00a35,000 but cancelled within the 14-day period. Instead of sending me back all the money, they have sent \u00a34,382, pointing to other documen tation that contradicts the wording on the cancellation form: 'I require the return of any money paid to you ...which I am entitled to have returned.'<br><strong>MR, Birmingham</strong> </p> <p>This cancellation clause can be read two ways and Aberdeen's interpretation differs from yours. </p> <p>You put emphasis on the word 'entitled' and believed you should get back all the money you paid over. Aberdeen emphasises the word 'which' and says you are entitled only to the lower price if units have fallen since you bought and your original investment if the price has risen. This is standard industry practice. </p> <p><strong> Children's funds: Perfect timing</strong></p> <p>Through my financial adviser, Willis National, I have put a few thousand pounds into the Mercury Global Titan fund in my name, but identified with the initials of my grandchild, aged six months. </p> <p>The key features document says that, when I die, the value can be released only by a grant of probate. If this coincided with, say, a teenager going to college, the delay in obtaining cash could be disruptive. Is there a better long-term investment for a grandchild that can be added to without penalty and has tax advantages?<br><strong>LT, Solihull </strong> </p> <p>The risk of your dying just as your grandchild starts university in 18 years' time is remote enough not to worry about. Over such a long period, investments linked to stock markets are the best choice and, by designating the account with the child's name, you have already min imised income tax. The simplest alternative is to put the money entirely in the child's name, but you would lose control. </p> <p>You could put some of the money in your wife's or another grandparent's name to spread the risk of one dying at a critical time. Otherwise, wait until the child reaches 15 and then move the money into a deposit account, perhaps a joint account with the child. </p> <p>Banks and building societies will release accounts worth up to \u00a35,000 without waiting for probate when a saver dies. Joint savings automatically go to the survivor. </p> <p><strong> Late mortgage? No worries</strong></p> <p>My wife and I own our own home, worth about \u00a340,000. We would like to borrow \u00a324,000 to move house. I am 57 and self-employed, earning about \u00a314,000 a year. My wife will retire in two years' time, aged 60, with full state pension. Is it unrealistic to think we could get a mortgage for this additional money?<br><strong>PK, Glasgow</strong> </p> <p>You should have no problem. While your income is low, you are borrowing less than 2.5 times your salary and can put down a large deposit. Your age is not an issue as you are still working and could perhaps work beyond 65. In fact, you may find that \u00a325,001 is the least you can borrow, as this is the starting point for most lenders. </p> <p>A repayment loan is best as you do not have enough time for investments to grow substantially. Borrowing \u00a325,001 at 6 per cent over 13 years costs \u00a3235 a month; over eight years \u00a3335. </p> <p>\u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

  "<p>You have just three weeks to complete and send in your tax return if you want the Inland Revenue to work out your tax bill on your behalf. </p> <p>Nine million people have received a tax return for the tax year 1999/2000. Taxpayers who file by the end of September can ask the Inland Revenue to calculate their tax liability for them. But those who leave it longer are warned by the Revenue that its staff may not complete the calculations on time. These people could find that they have to pay interest if any of their tax payments are late. </p> <p>The final deadline for filing your return is 31 January. If you miss it, you automatically get a \u00a3100 fine. </p> <p>But the real advantage of meeting the 30 September deadline is that you get the Revenue to do a job you could struggle badly with yourself. 'The calculation is absolutely horrendous - and I've done tax for 35 years,' says Richard Mannion, president of the Chartered Institute of Taxation and a partner in West Country firm Solomon Hare. </p> <p>Steven Bruck of chartered accountant Blick Rothenberg agrees: 'It is an amazingly complicated task, absolutely horrific.' The calculation booklet provided by the Inland Revenue runs this year to 29 pages, up from six last year and likely to grow again next year when new rules come in for people with children. </p> <p>A proliferation of tax rates - 0 per cent, the new 10 per cent rate, 20 per cent, 22 per cent and 40 per cent - is one of the reasons why the calculation is so tricky. </p> <p>But there are many others. You have to calculate your income figures differently to meet the general tax rules, for instance, and to work out your entitlement to Working Families Tax Credit. When the new Child Tax Credit comes into operation next April, another approach to the calculation will be required - which is why the 29-page form is likely to grow again in 2001. </p> <p>But the good news is that completing your tax return (without the tax liability calculation) can be relatively straightforward. If you have not begun it yet, you could follow these steps: </p> <p>\u0095 Check that the Revenue has sent you all the pages you need. The basic tax return runs to eight pages, but you may need to ask for supplementary pages if, for instance, are self-employed, have potential capital gains charges or fall into a few other specialist categories. The supplementary pages - listed on page two of the tax return - should be sent to you automatically if you also received them last year, but mistakes are sometimes made. Ring the Revenue orderline (0845 9000 404) if you need extra pages, or download them from <a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk\">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 Collect the other information you need to fill in the form - such as the year-end P60 form which your employer has to provide, listing your income, tax deducted and other vital figures. Pensioners will need similar information - their state pension book and the equivalent of the P60 they receive from the trustees of a private pension. </p> <p>People with savings and investments need interest certificates (showing how much tax has been deducted), dividend vouchers and any other relevant information. Other sources of income - freelance earnings, for example, and rental payments received - will also generate their own paperwork, including sets of accounts for the total received and expenses set off against it during the year. (Getting this information can be easier than you think: some building societies and employers will be happy to give you the figures on the telephone.) </p> <p>\u0095 Dust off last year's tax return. This will make your task far easier: if your circumstances are unchanged, you can probably use last year's form as your guide for this year. You can also save yourself possible trouble by giving a written explanation in a note if there is a change in your income. If your freelance income has dropped from \u00a310,000 to \u00a31,000, for instance, you may encourage the tax inspectors to launch an investigation into your tax affairs unless you give them a brief explanation. </p> <p>\u0095 Read the guidance that accompanies the tax return. There are many pitfalls which could see you paying more tax than you need. For example, it is vital that you put down your employed earnings figure after pension contributions. If you do not do this, you will do yourself out of the tax relief you are entitled to on them. Make sure you do not include income from Peps and Isas, warns John Whiting of accountant PricewaterhouseCoopers. </p> <p>\u0095 Ask for help if you need it. Staff at Inland Revenue offices are surprisingly helpful. You can ring up your local office and ask to make an appointment. They will not fill in the form for you, but they will advise you if an area is particularly difficult to understand. </p> <p>\u0095 Keep a copy of the return before you send it in. </p> <p>\u0095 Keep all your back-up information in a folder in case the Revenue asks you more questions or launches one of its dreaded investigations into your affairs. If you run your own business or have letting income, you must retain the relevant doc uments for five years after the 31 January final filing date. Other people need to keep their records and documents for a year after the 31 January filing date. </p> <p>\u0095 Expect to get a 'tax calculation' letter from the Revenue in a few weeks if you asked them to do the calculation. Check the figures as far as you can. Revenue staff sometimes type in the wrong figures when they transfer information from tax returns. Their software can also make mistakes because the system is so complex. </p> <p>Mannion points out that many people who make backdated pension contributions find that this part of their tax return is not dealt with at the same time as the rest of the form is processed. 'You can, in the first instance, find that the bill which is sent out is incorrect. You then need to complain and eventually the backdating claim should be sorted out.'</p> <p><strong>Whinge, moan, complain </strong></p> <p>Older people are particularly badly served by the Inland Revenue, says the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group. 'Older people are not getting the service they deserve, and complaints are not being properly dealt with,' says chairman John Andrews. </p> <p>He says pensioners are more likely to receive a shoddy service and less likely to complain than others. He cites many examples of Revenue rudeness, mistakes and reluctance to apologise.</p> <p>The way round hostility or lack of co-operation is often to make a formal complaint. But make the most of it. The advantage of a complaint is that it should be acknowledged within 48 hours, and a full response made within 28 days. If you simply write a letter, you can wait months for a reply.</p> <p>Make it clear what you are doing by writing the word 'complaint' at the top of the letter. Address your letter to the 'officer in charge'. Andrews suggests: 'You will need to give your tax office reference, but it may help if you show this not at the top of the letter, but within the first few sentences.

  "<p>Well, they made it. Despite the worst intentions of Thatcher and the best of Scargill, trade unions have survived into the twenty-first century. Today marks the start of their first Congress of the new millennium, and, on one level at least, there's a feeling that they're on a roll. </p> <p>Along with a raft of helpful legislation, last year they saw membership rise for the first time in two decades. The gain was substantial - 100,000 people joined unions in 1999, taking membership to 6.8 million. </p> <p>But there is a problem. According to the Trades Union Congress, the additions were in solid core constituencies - the public sector, teaching, manufacturing. A strengthening of the unions' traditional support base may bring cheers from branches around the country. But is this relevant to their future? Silence. </p> <p>Unions are seen as old organisations, in all the worst associations of the word. They are Old Labour. They are Old Economy. And they are made up of old people - the average age of UK union members is 46; the average age of all workers is just 34. </p> <p>John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, says: 'At the moment I think of little else. The whole future of trade unions depends on us demonstrating our value in new sectors. We can't just rest on our traditional heartlands of manufacturing and the public sector.' </p> <p>In July a seminar called Organising in the Network Economy was held by Union Network International, a Geneva-based umbrella organisation claiming affiliation from 15 million union members in 920 unions worldwide. It aims to encourage growth into high technology sectors. </p> <p>UNI's general secretary, Philip Jennings, says: 'The changes that information technology is bringing to the relationships between companies and their staff are creating firmer management and supervision, with less security. It is a massive transformation.' </p> <p>As UNI admits, the first problem is finding a clear starting point. There are few statistics revealing the penetration of unions into new-economy companies, some of which are hostile. </p> <p>'New organisations - Microsoft, Vodafone, anything owned by Rupert Murdoch - are very anti-union and determined to keep them out,' says Jennings. </p> <p>Older companies that start separate operations, such as mobile telecoms businesses, tend to set them up at arms length, free of union involvement. And the profile of their workforces is changing, too. A UNI paper states: 'Companies are churning their work forces... hiring younger people with more modern qualifications rather than retraining incumbent staff.' The physical environment of the new economy - greenfield offices or call centres - is a further barrier. </p> <p>Call centres burgeoned in the Nineties, with growth rates in the US and Europe of 30 to 40 per cent, and 100,000 jobs a year being created in Europe. The UK has led the way; 45 per cent of European call-centre capacity is located here. Call-centre operatives are forecast to outnumber teachers and farmers by 2002. </p> <p>Dai Davies, of financial services union Unifi, says: 'It is very hard to get into these places, and if you do, it is very difficult to talk to employees because supervision is so strict.' </p> <p>The problem for Unifi is growing as bank branches - membership strongholds - are closed. Membership has dropped from about 200,000 five years ago (in the three unions that formed Unifi) to 180,000 now - of whom 10,000 are in call centres. </p> <p>UNI says: 'A redundant worker who was a union member is invariably being replaced by a younger worker who is not a union member.' And it points out that membership among young workers is falling alarmingly. In Sweden, for example, the proportion of young unionised workers in 1993 was 62 per cent; by 1999 it was 47 per cent. </p> <p>Unions are also concerned that the growth in demand for IT professionals - the EU predicts a 1.7 million shortfall by 2003 - has led countries in the UK and the US to look to 'import' skilled workers from places such as India and Asia. Not only does this show that governments accept that companies are not prepared to retrain existing, possibly unionised workers, it creates another economically important group that has no traditional attachment to unions. </p> <p>But do new-economy employees need to organise? Of course, say the unions. The virtues of the new economy - flexibility, speed, opportunity - are virtues only to employers. To employees, they are vices - insecurity, intrusion, stress. </p> <p>Unions may be shunted out as old companies set up new businesses. But this provides unions a way into the new organisations - by tracking the former employees. The Communication Wor kers Union, nearly half of whose 280,000 members came from BT and other telecoms or engineering backgrounds, has been tracking members as BT has fragmented. </p> <p>'We have had to identify and follow the membership,' says Jeannie Drake, CWU deputy general secretary. 'First we look to those who leave BT, and try to get recognition in companies where they go. So, for example, CWU has recognition agreements in parts of telecoms groups such as Nortel, Global Crossing and Corning Cables. We also have to go into areas BT has bought into - such as retailer DX Communications.' </p> <p>But there remains an uncomfortably long list of 'priority targets', from big mobile-phone operators such as Vodafone and Orange, through cable companies and bigger internet operations. The CWU points to legislation - particularly the Employ ment Relations Act, which gives unions legal rights to recognition and to represent employees in grievances - as levers for breaking into new businesses. </p> <p>But it will be difficult. Five years ago the CWU had 160,000 members in telecoms - 150,000 in BT. Now it has 110,000, with 70,000 in BT. The erosion of the state monopoly has eaten away at union membership. </p> <p>This would all be very depressing if it were not for recent successful union action in the US - particularly a campaign by the CWU's counterpart, the Communication Workers of America. The CWA represented 35,000 employees at Verizon, a US telecoms company, who went on strike for two weeks last month over pay and conditions of work. </p> <p>The strike gave the CWA massive exposure and raised the issue of the power of unions within the new economy in the free-market US. But the terms of the settlement were as interesting as the dispute itself. It estab lished the right of workers to organise in the wireless division of Verizon - partly owned by Vodafone. As one influential American commentator remarked: 'Their willingness to strike, not over current workers' wages or benefits, but over the future of hi-tech unionism, suggests a new chapter in labour relations and a surprising foothold in the information economy.' </p> <p>Jeff Miller of the CWA says: 'We have been extremely aggressive in targeting new economy companies and trying to represent what employees want. There is clearly a demand for organisation and union representation in the new economy, and we are beginning to get that message through.'. </p> <p>Its tactics seem to be working. Since 1995 union membership among US workers has fallen from 15.5 per cent to 13.9 per cent. But the CWA has seen its membership rise, by 20 per cent. It now stands at around 630,000 - 500,000 of whom are in telecoms and 'new' sectors. Future targets include MCI Worldcom and internet companies such as Amazon. </p> <p>The Verizon action is just one of a number of disputes that indicate that IT workers are organising. Jennings points to a 47-day strike by 18,000 computer technician and engineer members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees at Boeing, triggered by a pay dispute. It was the largest white-collar dispute since the war. </p> <p>And unions are using the internet to organise themselves, running 'e-campaigns' and 'cyberpickets', where unions pressurise companies to update members on the progress of disputes and get petitions and protests signed via the net. Canada's Communication, Energy and Paper Workers Union (CEP) has 'cyberpicketed' the Calgary Herald newspaper - formerly owned by Conrad Black - over contract terms. </p> <p>The Washington Alliance of Technology Workers (WashTec) grew out of the software industry around Microsoft because of insecurity created by short-term contracts. </p> <p>It has 250 members in Microsoft and an online news service with 2,000 subscribers. Its aims are to 'work to make sick pay, holiday pay and decent medical coverage basic workplace rights'. A similar organisation exists at IBM, called Alliance@IBM. </p> <p>Joel Yudken, head of policy at the AFL-CIO, the national union federation, says: 'In the US the labour movement has turned a corner. Professionals in places like Verizon and Boeing are speaking out. In the new economy you see a feeling of growing insecurity. They are beginning to look to unions to help.' That is what lies behind CWA's increase. </p> <p>The UK's communications union certainly wants to emulate its US cousins. In five years' time it hopes that the majority of its members will be outside BT, and that membership will have passed the 160,000 level of five years ago. But will enough workers answer its call? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.morgan@observer.co.uk\">oliver.morgan@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>He was the golden boy who could do no wrong. Over eight years, from the age of only 25, John Michael Clegg built Wace from a near-bankrupt stock market shell into the world's biggest provider of pre-press photographic and design services to the advertising and media industries. Until January 1992, that is, when the fast-talking City whizz kid quit abruptly, blaming wild rumours about his alleged links with the IRA for destabilising the company. </p> <p>Clegg firmly denied terrorist connections. But the authorities had taken the talk seriously enough to convene a secret meeting at the Stock Exchange the previous summer. Present were representatives from the Royal Ulster Constabulary's C13 anti-racketeering squad, the Serious Fraud Office, the Bank of England and the exchange's own insider dealing unit. The inquiry, however, was shelved and no evidence found to back up the gossip. </p> <p>The truth about Clegg and some of his family's murky dealings has now finally been revealed, after an eight-and-a-half year inquiry by the Department of Trade and Industry. Stretching to 300 pages, the DTI's report tells a tale of fraud, lies, deception, insider dealing, forgery and fake bank accounts. The story is a cocktail of high stakes finance and slapstick farce. And the biggest surprise is not that after all this time no further action is likely, but that the book on Wace was not closed sooner. </p> <p>Clegg, his father John Henry and uncle Albert - the three villains of the piece - had long since skipped abroad, their whereabouts unknown. In all, the DTI inspectors say they used no fewer than 29 aliases for secret wheeler-dealing in Wace and its takeover targets, Parkway, European Colour and Tinsley Robor. </p> <p>Members of the extended Clegg family across three continents piled into the shares - so many of them, indeed, that it quickly became a standing joke in the boardroom. One ex-Wace director said it was a tradition to ask: 'Come on John, who is this one?' Clegg's invariable response was: 'I am sorry, but I have a lot of relations.' </p> <p>The trio ruthlessly booked deals in the names of their relatives, several of whom had no idea that their names were being used. A two-month-old baby, long dead acquain tances and non-existent associates were among the characters to turn up on share registers, in offshore bank accounts and on a confetti of fake documents. Wace's advisers and the trio's numerous bankers were hoodwinked, said the DTI, which cleared them of any complicity. </p> <p>'Mr J M Clegg was an extremely convincing individual whose subsequent domination of the Wace board increased in proportion with the company's spectacular growth by acquisition into a major plc,' the inspectors concluded. </p> <p>'Most notably we believe he benefited from substantial secret dealings in the shares of Wace, European Colour, Tinsley Robor and Parkway through bank accounts in his name at Credit Suisse and... with Anglo Irish Bank.' </p> <p>Clegg's first involvement with Wace was based on a lie. Casting around for a shell company, he and his father lighted on the struggling firm in 1983. Their initial \u00a3270,000 investment, they said, came from a wealthy cousin of Clegg's in South Africa. </p> <p>In fact, she was Clegg's half-sister, Jayne Wright, a 19-year-old love child from an affair his father had in the mid-Sixties. The money, it is believed, came from the sale of a ragbag of properties the Cleggs owned in Sheffield. Clegg barely knew Wright and she had, the inspectors found, no idea of the secret deals in her name. </p> <p>Nor, later on, had her husband and baby daughter, whose names were also used. The marriage collapsed under the strain of the revelations. But, with poetic justice, in 1993 she sued for control of accounts and properties in her name, robbing Clegg and his father of \u00a310 million of their ill-gotten gains. </p> <p>Clegg's whole life, indeed, may have been a cruel deception. Born on a holiday in Nice in 1958, he was christened William - the name later used on the Anglo Irish Bank account for many of his share deals. </p> <p>A month later, at the British consulate in Marseilles, his father registered a new name. The reason, said witnesses, was not just that his wife wanted John, but that her sister was Clegg's real mother. Clegg, meanwhile, was 'astonished' to hear of the first birth certificate. The inspectors concluded drily: 'Clearly we are not in a position to say who the parents of Mr J M Clegg are.' </p> <p>Clegg's father and uncle had an equally colourful background. Identical twins, they were born in Sheffield in 1919, the sons of a bookmaker turned property developer, and both had been bankrupted by the Inland Revenue. They would regularly impersonate one another. 'They operate false passports ... they can shuffle them up like playing cards,' one witness said. </p> <p>In the Sixties, the twins first punted on the stock market and ran their own firm, South Yorkshire Motor Insurance, which was wound up by the DTI in 1967. That set alarm bells ringing early at Wace, but it was young Clegg, after all, who was on the board, and the directors comforted themselves with his training as a solicitor at respected City law firm, Nabarro Nathanson. </p> <p>In fact both his father and uncle quickly and secretly moved into Wace. Using the aliases Michael and Albert Clark, and operating as Geoffrey's Securities Services, they were first handed the wages collection contract. Father and son advised the board on deals. The directors had no idea of the connection. </p> <p>Albert, too, had the run of the place as Wace's janitor, gaining the nickname 'Uncle Geoffrey'. They were 'like two peas in a pod', said company secretary Finlay Scott Ritchie. 'You could only tell who was who by the fact that one usually saw Michael Clark in a suit and Uncle Geoffrey was usually in a mess.' </p> <p>Wace expanded rapidly by acquisition. Nevertheless, and entirely unknown to the outside world, Clegg family members and friends at one point owned more than 40 per cent of the company. Clegg's failure to disclose such dealings repeatedly misled investors and broke the law, the inspectors found. </p> <p>In 1986, the Clegg trio unsuccessfully tried to pressurise European Colour, an inkmaker, into a deal. They spread false rumours in the market, the DTI found, built up a large secret stake and, using aliases, the twins heckled the European Colour board at its annual meeting. </p> <p>The pattern was repeated from 1998 to 1990 at the print and packaging group Tinsley Robor, where Wace and certain members of Clegg's fam ily built up a 25 per cent stake. One of the aliases used to hide the buying was Harold Staniforth, someone the twins had known during their childhood in Sheffield but who had died in 1930 at age 11. </p> <p>As Staniforth, in reality Uncle Albert, was then being hunted by private detectives working for the retail broker Sharelink to recover a debt it was hardly surprising when Clegg mused that it was 'not the most suitable name' to have used. This did not prevent Clegg from vouching for the long-dead 'Staniforth'. 'We can only surmise how, 58 years after Mr H Staniforth died, Mr J M Clegg claimed to the Wace board to have met him,' the inspectors wrote. </p> <p>By 1990, Wace had turned its guns on Parkway, its main rival, which had hit serious financial trouble. After long and tortuous negotiations, Wace clinched the deal for \u00a311m that August. Once again the Clegg trio built up a large undeclared stake. In all, Wace and Clegg family members owned 17.8 per cent of Parkway. 'As the tempo built up in the takeover discussions... so did the purchases of shares in Parkway by certain members of the Clegg family,' the DTI inspectors said. </p> <p>'If the true facts had been publicly available in 1990, this would have led to Mr J M Clegg's immediate removal from the Wace board and the possible abandonment of the proposed takeover.' </p> <p>This time the secret stakebuilding did raise alarm bells at Wace's advisers, BZW. The Wace board, too, finally pressed the issue, employing a private detective to gather evidence. Wace's dossier was handed to the DTI in early 1992, and within weeks the inspectors were appointed. </p> <p>The market at last sensed a scandal. Wace's shares plunged in value by 40 per cent after the Parkway deal. The Clegg trio, however, had already secretly made their escape. While possessing all the inside information, they had illicitly offloaded most of their Wace shares for \u00a37m during the Parkway talks.</p>",
  "<p>The former boss of media services group Wace and certain members of his family committed insider dealing on a huge scale, a long-awaited Department of Trade &amp; Industry report has concluded. </p> <p>The report has found that John Clegg, Wace's former chief executive, his father and his uncle were guilty of flagrant breaches of company law and Stock Exchange rules from 1984 to 1992. </p> <p>DTI inspectors were appointed in February 1992 to investigate share dealings in Wace and three of the firm's takeover targets: Parkway, European Colour and Tinsley Robor. From 1984, Clegg built Wace into the world's top pre-press services group, but he quit in January 1992 following unfounded rumours of alleged IRA involvement. </p> <p>Controversially, however, the DTI plans to take no further action. Clegg, his father and his uncle fled the country during the investigation. They were last understood to be in Florida, Chicago and Australia respectively, but the DTI has no idea where they are now. </p> <p>The inquiry was conducted under Section 442 of the Companies Act and, after its failure to extradite convicted fraudster Roger Levitt from the US for alleged offences under the Act, the DTI is wary of further humiliation. </p> <p>'The prime culprits are no longer under the jurisdiction of the UK courts,' a DTI spokesman said. 'If they come within UK jurisdiction, we will consider what further action to take.' </p> <p>The report was published without fanfare by the DTI on 31 August. Just three Companies Act reports remain to be published: investigations into Robert Maxwell and the Mirror Group flotation, the demise of hotel firm Queen's Moat Houses and DTI grant applications by former Paymaster-General Geoffrey Robinson's collapsed engineering firm, Transtec. </p> <p>Wace was finally taken over by US rival Applied Graphics Technologies last year. The DTI report concluded that Clegg, and his father and uncle made millions from insider dealing using aliases and offshore bank accounts. </p> <p>The three hoodwinked Credit Suisse, Anglo Irish Bank, NatWest and many others into opening accounts in false names. The DTI cleared banks and advisers used by the trio of any blame.</p>",
  "<p>Spike Lee has just made the most successful film of his career. It doesn't feature one of Denzel Washington's seemingly effortless portrayals of a complex, troubled man. Nor does it feature Lee's inventive use of colour, or an upside down camera, or references to the work of his heroes Wilder, Godard, Scorsese or Kazan. This time round, all Lee did was point a cheap video camera at a stage and record four guys talking. But if you look at the figures on a per cinema basis, Original Kings Of Comedy has outperformed most of the big summer hits. </p> <p>Maybe that isn't a surprise. After all the confused signals Hollywood has been picking up this summer - Are stars in or out? Are historical epics worth it (Gladiator) or possibly not (The Patriot) - one thing seems clear: black men being funny works. Big Momma's House featuring Martin Lawrence and Scary Movie, which starred and was written by Shawn and Marlon Wayans, have been unexpected blockbusters. And this in a summer when neither Will Smith nor aspirant superstar Chris Tucker had a film out. What's going on? </p> <p>Perhaps the best place to begin is Eddie Murphy's latest hit star vehicle, The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, which reaches these shores in October. Not because the film has that much going for it: it's the usual mix of gooey good-heartedness and gross-out comedy, with the obesity of the Klump family (almost all played by Murphy) as the starting point for most of the jokes. But long before he re-emerged as a movie star with Nutty Professor, Murphy was a vital figure in the evolution of black comedy, both at his peak and because his career crisis prompted a search for the next Eddie Murphy which belatedly spawned this year's stars. </p> <p>Before Murphy, of course, there were Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor. Cosby was the original. In the early Sixties he was the first black stand-up to cross over to a mainstream (that's to say mainly white) audience. Inspired by him, Pryor started off with a similar vein of amiable humour. But he was a different kind of man, scarred by a horrendous childhood (he grew up a brothel). Liberated by the influence of Malcolm X and Lenny Bruce, he became an incendiary performer, brilliant but openly self-loathing. 'Pryor started everything. He's Yoda,' says Scary Movie director Keenan Ivory Wayans. </p> <p>That Pryor became seen as the anti-Cosby doesn't mean there was antagonism between the two: when they appeared together in California Suite (1978), Pryor insisted Cosby get paid equally with him. But while Cosby rarely ruffled his audiences, here's a Pryor joke at the expense of Martin Luther King: 'I have been to the mountain top too, and what did I see? More white people with guns.' </p> <p> But with a few exceptions - Blue Collar, Uptown Saturday Night, the script for Blazing Saddles - Pryor's film career never did justice to his talent. Yet despite massive drug abuse, he was hugely successful in the late Seventies, especially paired with Gene Wilder in Silver Streak (1976) and Stir Crazy (1980). In 1983, when the decline had set in, he was still getting paid more than Christopher Reeve to appear in Superman III. </p> <p>In those days Hollywood was willing to accommodate one famous funny black at a time (just as even today, executives are unsure that there is room for both Jennifer Lopez and Salma Hayek). So as Pryor stalled, Eddie Murphy rose. It's worth remembering just how big Murphy was at his peak: not just popular, around the time of Beverly Hills Cop (1984) he was as central to the feel of the mid-80s as Madonna or Prince or Miami Vice.</p> <p>His stage act, packed with four letter words and a rather insistent homophobia, was clearly influenced by Pryor, but coming from a stable middle-class background, he lacked the same inner rage. 'I've only been called \"nigger\" once in my life. There is very little anger in my humour,' he admitted. Murphy's hero, his obsession, turned out to be Elvis. But despite steering clear of drink and drugs, Murphy too found his career dipping violently in the late Eighties, mostly caused by an inability to chose decent films. </p> <p>In the short term the vacuum wasn't filled. But Murphy's Eighties superstardom, plus the memory of Pryor at his best, had inspired ambitious young black men to try comedy, and given the space to do so, especially on a couple of seminal TV shows. And it is that generation who are just reaching their peak now. Various Wayans brothers could be seen on In Living Color in the early Nineties. Most of the rest - including Chris Tucker and Martin Lawrence - appeared on Def Comedy Jam, which ran from 1993 to 1996. </p> <p>Many of them, including Lawrence, went down the sitcom route, but Tucker - a stand-up with a helium voice and a knack for physical comedy - was determined not to get stuck doing TV. The movies, he reasoned, were where the real stars were. He got his break when he starred with Ice Cube in the laidback 'hood comedy Friday . The film did OK in the cinemas but was hugely successful on video. Soon he was appearing in Luc Besson's deranged The Fifth Element and Tarantino's Jackie Brown, and co-starring with Charlie Sheen in Money Talks and Jackie Chan in Rush Hour. </p> <p>It was Rush Hour that made him a real star, one who can command the same kind of money that Eddie Murphy can. By doing The Fifth Element and by making a film with Chan, Tucker ensured he made a name in the vast film market outside the US, where black film stars usually struggle. So when he decided he wanted to make a film where he plays the first black president, Bill Clinton let him tag along for a few days. Which meant it was no surprise that Tucker gently declined Ice Cube's request that he appear in the sequel to Friday. Playing a neighbourhood slacker with a huge marijuana habit was no longer part of the plan (the film, incidentally, was a hit without him). </p> <p>Tucker talks about Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks as his inspirations. And why not? He doesn't come from the bullet-strewn streets of the South Bronx: he's from a middle class suburb of Atlanta. 'I always have thought in terms of the largest possible audience,' he says. 'I want everyone to relate to what I am doing. And that's been easy, because in my career I haven't experienced any racism.' </p> <p>You can hear the echoes of Murphy there. It is tempting to see traces of the Cosby-Pryor divide in the contrast between Chris Tucker and Chris Rock, not least because people often confuse the two. Rock is the opposite of Tucker in many ways: he's working class from Brooklyn, his comedy is entirely verbal, he likes working on TV, being a stand-up is more central to his career, and he doesn't see the world in colour-blind terms: his most recent TV special was called Bigger and Blacker. But, equally, Rock has pointed out that since only around 12 per cent of Americans are black, anyone who keeps it too 'real' is going to have a very limited career. His comedy idols included Woody Allen and Jerry Seinfeld as well as the inevitable Pryor, and his last two films have been for loquacious white directors Kevin Smith (Dogma) and Neil LaBute (Nurse Betty, released last week). </p> <p>But while Pryor and Cosby were effectively unchallenged, Rock and Tucker are far from alone. Big Momma's House was one of the most surprising successes of the summer. The star, Lawrence, shared equal billing with Will Smith (1993's Bad Boys) and Eddie Murphy (last year's Life). But only now has he reached the A-list. Big Momma's House is a terrible film, but like The Nutty Professor II, it uses the conceit of having a young-ish man play a fat, elderly woman. And that seems to go down endlessly well with the American public: Big Momma's House has picked up $119m, turning a tidy profit on its $30m budget. Some black commentators have worried that this film, and The Klumps, exploit fried chicken-chomping stereotypes. Spike Lee's next film, Bamboozled , attacks US television's predilection for lowbrow black comedy shows. But at the current level of success, Hollywood couldn't care less. </p> <p>There is a mystery underlying all this: comedy on US TV remains stubbornly segregated. Blacks won't watch Friends or Frasier, whites refused to watch Murphy's animated show The PJs. Martin Lawrence's sitcom Malcolm ran for four years without ever being a true mainstream success, while the Wayans brothers' TV show was cancelled not long before Scary Movie took off. </p> <p>The acts in Original Kings Of Comedy are also TV regulars, without troubling the higher reaches of the ratings. Is it that white America is happy to watch blacks on the big screen but not at home? It seems unlikely, considering Seventies hits such as Sanford and Son, Good Times and The Jeffersons, and more recently Will Smith's The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air, not to mention The Cosby Show. </p> <p>No one has figured that out yet. But what is certain is that whether they blandly insist that 'funny is funny' like Tucker, or extract comedy from the difference between blacks and whites like the guys in Original Kings Of Comedy, the film industry is finally ready to accept more than one funny black guy at a time. </p> <p>\u0095 Nutty Professor II: The Klumps opens 6 October</p>",
  "<p>Football is the world's most popular sport. Yet there's never been a movie of the first rank about soccer and almost the only convincing game is the outrageous match dominated by Brian Glover as the player-referee in Kes. </p> <p>On the other hand, chess, the world's most cerebral pastime, the real intricacies of which relatively few people comprehend, has been the subject of some classic and highly popular pictures over the years. </p> <p>From Pudovkin's satirical Chess Fever and Raymond Bernard's The Chess Player in the silent era, through Bergman's Seventh Seal and Satyajit Ray's The Chess Player, to the recent American movies Searching for Bobby Fischer (aka Innocent Moves) and Losing Isaiah, pieces have been shifted on chequered boards. </p> <p>One explanation is that it's difficult to stage a complex team game like football. A more obvious one is that chess provides a series of immediately understood metaphors - for life and death in the Bergman movie, for a crafty move by the Raj in Ray's film, and for the dialectics of gang warfare in Losing Isaiah. The game is also highly photogenic. </p> <p>The Dutch director Marleen Gorris (whose last film was a version of Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway) adds to this list of distinguished chess movies with The Luzhin Defence. A work of considerable intellectual and physical elegance, it's rather cleverly adapted by a British writer Peter Berry from Vladimir Nabokov's 1930 novel. </p> <p>In this book, Nabokov discovered his mature style and established himself at the age of 30 as the pre-eminent Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 author, though it wasn't translated into English for 33 years. </p> <p>For more than a decade, John Turturro has been specialising in characters whose awkward bodies contain flashing minds, troubled spirits and pure hearts. </p> <p>In Marleen Gorris's film, he's utterly convincing as the 30-ish Alexander Luzhin, a Russian chess master whose life comes into dangerously combustible focus in 1929 when he comes to a hotel beside Lake Como to take part in a tournament. </p> <p>The shambling, unkempt Luzhin has been bound up with chess all his life, and flashbacks to his childhood, part hell, part idyll in Tsarist St Petersburg, reveal how this obsession was shaped by his haut-bourgeois parents' loveless marriage and his relationship with the beautiful aunt who introduced him to the game. </p> <p>After destroying his father at the chess board, he beats his former schoolmaster, the demonic Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), who becomes his exploitative 'chess father', taking him around Europe as a prodigy for 14 years, before dropping him when his game begins to falter. </p> <p>At Lake Como, Luzhin meets a possible redeemer in the form of Natalia (Emily Watson), an unconventional beauty, daughter of rich aristocratic Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s. A rebel against her rigid background, she sees beneath the unprepossessing surface, beyond the lack of small talk and social graces, to the beauty of his soul. </p> <p>Natalia is attracted rather than repelled by the intensity of his feelings, and when he suddenly proposes marriage, she accepts. Watson with her radiant smile and blue eyes and Turturro with his twitching grimaces and brown eyes make this curious, precipitate courtship ring affectingly true. </p> <p>But in addition to being a love story, The Luzhin Defence is a thriller about rivalry, power and destruction. Ranged against Luzhin are Natalia's parents, who have understandable reservations, the immaculately groomed Italian grandmaster he must face, and the suave, vindictive Valentinov, who has returned to abet the fall of his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9. </p> <p>A deadly endgame faces him, on and off the board. As he stands on the brink of total collapse, his mind as fragile as the glass king he's carried since learning chess as a child, there emerges the alternative of abandoning chess for Natalia. 'A balanced normal life - is that what I've got to reduce him to?' she asks a psychiatrist. </p> <p> The Luzhin Defence flirts with melodrama in a way that Nabokov doesn't, and plays with obvious (if persuasive) Freudian explanations of the sort Nabokov consistently mocked. But it mounts to an exciting climax, and is resolved in a manner I found quietly satisfying, though some may think it glib.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Life in the Jungle: My Autobiography</strong><br>Michael Heseltine<br>Hodder &amp; Stoughton \u00a320, pp542<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502450380,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Representative democracy cannot live without characters. The theatre of big egos and sprawling talents keeps the audience's interest alive. People say it's only the issues that matter, but as soon as the theatre folds, the audience melts away. For that reason, Michael Heseltine has been one of the great servants of British democratic life since the Seventies, a vivid, preening carnivore who helped put the life into arguments that convulsed the country. From council house sales to CND, Toxteth to Margaret Thatcher, at some time or other Heseltine has provoked gurgles of private agreement and teeth-grindings of angry dissent in half the kitchens of the nation. </p> <p>We know, or think we do, the main outlines of his story - the dyslexic schoolboy who made a fortune in low-rent hotels and magazines, became a Heathite Tory MP, a technocratic Minister, Margaret Thatcher's great enemy, the 'nearly man' who might have been Prime Minister or party leader on at least three occasions but who didn't, and has now retired to contemplate, rather than swing among, his fine collection of trees. </p> <p>British political memoirs tend to follow a predictable pattern. The early life, with its interesting revelations of family eccentricity and tough, ambition-forging times, is followed by the Oxbridge years, when lifelong political friendships and contacts are formed. Then comes the breathless account of the first constituency campaign, the charmingly self-mocking account of that terrifying maiden speech, the gruff advice from Sir Old Salt MP - what a character! - then the tramp, tramp, tramp of departmental achievements. As he tramps, Our Hero absolves himself from any errors other memoirs attack him for, and energetically reheats ancient grudges. </p> <p>Wives appear in a blur. Children provide a few paragraphs of amusing background colour. A couple of imperfectly remembered jokes are hastily inserted after the first read-through. And - hey presto! - it's time to call the chap at the Daily Mail who apparently pays such a lot to extract the microwaved grudges. Strangely, Our Hero has no examples of his own of petty spite, failure of vision or genuine remorse to record. </p> <p>This autobiography follows the pattern but it is vastly better than most. Heseltine says he does not find writing (or reading) easy and he is not an exciting prose writer. But, presumably thanks to veteran journalist Anthony Howard, who has been a close friend since student days and helped with it, this is one of the most elegant, politically informative and, in the widest sense, literate reviews of a political life in many years. It is not up there with the great autobiographies of Healey or Jenkins, but it stands easy comparison with Thatcher, Major or Lawson. </p> <p>Like many people, I always found Heseltine rather aloof, wary, even cold. He is certainly a private man. His frank account of the catastrophic effect of his father's early death is not followed by much later soul-baring. The general tone is of wry lack of self-pity, amusement at the pitfalls and treacheries of political life and disdain, rather than anger, for old enemies such as Airey Neave, Normans Tebbit, Lamont and Thatcher herself. </p> <p>It is impressive rather than endearing. And indeed it is a curious tribute to the British class system that a Swansea boy who made his fortune in London bedsits and commercial magazines and who was much lampooned as a wideboy 'who has to buy his own furniture' should, in his sixties, have the aura of a very grand grandee indeed, the nearest Blair's Britain has to a Whig aristo. </p> <p>So why is the book so good, lacking as it does the easy bile, the maudlin revelations or the gossip that mostly keeps us reading? Close students of the great dramas of Heseltine's career - his near-bankruptcy, the mace-waving, his Cabinet resignation, his leadership challenge, his involvement in the Ponting or Matrix Churchill cases, won't even find much new information on those, though the Westland story is one that still makes me seethe when I read it. </p> <p>No, the cheering, old-fashioned answer is that Life in the Jungle is crammed with detail and serious explanation about many of the issues that have mattered most to Heseltine and Britain over the years. His struggle to respond practically to inner-city despair, above all in Liverpool; the complex, fascinating tale of how Margaret Thatcher abused her power to please her friends during Westland; the grappling with industrial change, council house sales, privatisations, transport schemes, wildlife protection and rough sleepers - those sorts of things are the meat of the book. </p> <p>It's a book about doing, not being. From his early days as a businessman to his political apotheosis as President of the Board of Trade and Deputy Prime Minister, Heseltine has been a formidable doer, a hands-on administrator fascinated by the processes of power. He has put that gift to the service of a political identity which was once common among the Heathite Tories but is less so now - hawkish on defence, pro-European, tough-minded to the point of hardness when it comes to profits and the virtue of capitalism generally, yet genuinely gripped by the plight of the poor and courageously liberal on race at a time when it wasn't half so easy. </p> <p>He also has a strong sense of history. He would never have tried to persuade Margaret Thatcher to make him 'Minister for Merseyside', it seems, had he not been gripped by awe and desolation at how the once great city port had collapsed from within. Perhaps less happily, he would not have embraced the Millennium Dome had he not dreamed of emulating the Great Exhibition and the Festival of Britain. </p> <p>The most important missing ingredient, however, is a fully honest discussion of his own driving ambition. After Westland, he writes as if all the momentum that led him to challenge Thatcher came from outside, as if an eccentric army of newspaper editors, disaffected backbench MPs and humble commoners was urging the rebel general on, entirely to his own surprise. Yet he kept a detailed record of backbench Tory support hidden in his office and was prowling round Thatcher like the predator he also is. He describes it as 'my own battle for political survival', which is perhaps more eloquent than he intended. </p> <p>Thatcher was one top beast and he was another, and they both knew it, and knew only one could survive. They stoked up their mutual loathing because at some level they had no choice. It's simple, David Attenborough stuff and it happens often in politics. This is the deeper, serious, policy Heseltine but the man we watched in the theatre, the human tiger, was real enough too. Admitting it would have made this book fully honest and raised it from being very good, which it certainly is, to a real classic. </p> <p><strong> Hezza: a life</strong></p> <p> <strong> Born </strong> 21 March 1933, son of Colonel R.D.

His clear and vigorous language reminds us that the poem is a dramatic story, intended to be read aloud as a performance. </p> <p>Beowulf was composed at some time between the seventh and tenth centuries and was almost lost to us; the one manuscript copy was nearly destroyed by fire in the eighteenth century. It was only after this that it was transcribed and studied at any length. </p> <p>Heaney began the project in 1980s but was soon daunted by the Herculean nature of the task: 'The whole attempt to turn it into modern English seemed to me like trying to bring down a megalith with a toy hammer.' Part of his determination to continue, however, came from a passion for his own literary and linguistic origins, and a gradual discovery that the Irish language, for him a badge of ideology that he had always considered diametrically opposed to English, actually has much in common with the Anglo-Saxon of the poem. The introduction is full of these fascinating digressions as well as essential background to the poem. </p> <p>'I came to the task of translating Beowulf with a prejudice in favour of forthright delivery,' Heaney says, and he has achieved this admirably - the verse is direct and punchy, faithfully sustaining the rhythm of the original though stamping it unmistakably with his own voice, particularly in the form of Ulster colloquialisms which punctuate the story. These, he says, he has used in instances where he felt the Ulster word to be 'poetically or historically right'. </p> <p>Purists may take issue with this, but students and general readers alike will be grateful for this work for many years to come.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Mauve </strong><br>Simon Garfield<br>Faber \u00a39.99, pp222<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000000784,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>A faded celebrity chemist, a flamboyant empress and an experiment to synthesise quinine gone wrong; Simon Garfield's history of the synthetic dye industry mixes chemistry and social history into quite a colourful tale. </p> <p>The first synthetic dye was invented by British chemist William Perkin. He went on to manufacture mauve dye commercially with great success. By his death, he was famous on both sides of the Atlantic and the toast of chemists worldwide. A hundred years on, his portrait has been removed from the National Portrait Gallery and his name had slipped into obscurity. Mauve determines to set the record straight. </p> <p>In 1856, at the age of 18, William Perkin of Shadwell, east London, a student of the newly founded Royal College of Chemistry, set out to make artificial quinine from coal tar (malaria was still rampant in England during the 1850s). Instead of quinine, his experiment resulted in a reddish powder. Further tests, this time using aniline as a base, produced a powder which turned purple in alcohol. In spite of the fact that aniline had been linked with colour-producing reactions for 30 years, Perkin was so excited by his discovery that he immediately stained some silk cloth a striking purple. </p> <p>Yet, torn between the practice of pure chemistry and the pursuit of chemistry as a commercial enterprise, he was unsure what to do next. Eventually, he patented the colour and started producing the dye commercially. One year after his discovery, the flamboyant Empress Eugenie decided that purple would be the colour for the season, and Paris was soon awash with the new shade. Perkin stepped up production and became one of the wealthiest men of his day. However, control of the lucrative synthetic dye trade soon slipped into German hands. (This was neither the first nor the last time a British invention was made more profitable overseas; Tim Berners-Lee's worldwide web is a recent example.) </p> <p>Ultimately, it was the many applications of Perkin's work that secured his fame - in medicine, photography and explosives. Not all the applications were beneficial, though. I.G. Faber, a large German dye company, ran the slave labour camp Monowitz-Buna for the Nazis. </p> <p>On a lighter note, Garfield finds it ironic that the first synthetic dye to be mass-produced should be purple, given the colour's historic association with power and sovereignty. While Garfield's tone is a little dry, Mauve is a fitting tribute to the man who pioneered industrial chemistry.</p>",
  "<p>Players wield so much power nowadays that it should come as no surprise to find a number earning more from their clubs than their team managers.</p> <p> When Coventry's chairman, Bryan Richardson, and I were looking through the highest wage-earners at Highfield Road last season, we found that I was as low as sixteenth on the list.</p> <p> We joked that I should count myself lucky, on the grounds that at least I was higher in the table than Bryan.</p> <p> I have become used to this at Coventry. When I was player-manager, and taking part in matches at the age of 39 or 40, it was a source of amusement to me (if 'amusement' is the right word) that members of my squad were able to pick up more than me even when they were watching a match from the stands.</p> <p> However, managers like me will not be in this situation if and when European football is forced by the EU to scrap transfer fees. Then, instead of managers being the poor relations, it will be the players. It has been argued that the end of the transfer system as we know it can only mean more money in the already full pockets of players. I beg to differ and, like Crystal Palace's manager Alan Smith in his column last week, I think that the vision of players laughing all the way to the bank - even more heartily than many of them might do already - is very misleading.</p> <p> For me, the reality behind the principle of players being treated like any other workers under EU laws - being able to end their contracts whenever they wish to do so, and without transfer fees involved - is that the players will generally suffer as much as the clubs.</p> <p> The players at the top level - the stars at places such as Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal - will get richer. In terms of funding players' salaries, transfer market income is comparatively unimportant to clubs of that financial stature because of the money they rake in from gate receipts, TV, corporate hospitality and merchandising.</p> <p> It is a different story at most of the other clubs in England. To varying degrees, they all rely on the money they can make in the transfer market to keep their heads above water. Coventry are as good an example as any. I hate to think what position we would have been in today but for the \u00a37 million profit we made through selling Robbie Keane to Inter Milan for \u00a313 million. Had Keane not been sold, major cuts would have had to be made.</p> <p> There seems little doubt that the inability of clubs to indulge in the transfer-market wheeling and dealing, which has been an integral part of the culture of the professional game, will result in the vast majority of players having to settle for much less money than they are getting now. It will surely hasten the move of the top clubs into a European super league, and widen the already massive gap between them and the rest of the professional football cast in England.</p> <p>I think there is a lot to be said for some measure of sanity being restored to English football with regards to players' salaries. A lot of clubs are already spending more in this department than they can afford, so it can be argued that any legislation that might have the effect of bringing wages down to a more realistic level should be applauded.</p> <p> However, I find it very difficult to look upon the EU's position as being good for European football. Of course, nothing has yet been decided, and until it is and we have everything down in black and white we can only make an educated guess at the final outcome. The initial interpretations of how it could all end up are, however, disconcerting to say the least.</p> <p>For example, one argument is that if players are able to break their ties with a club more easily, it will also be easier for clubs to get rid of them. I can envisage a situation whereby clubs, in order to cut wage costs during the summer, would keep paying their best players but lay off the others with the view of re-hiring them - at a lower price - before the start of the new season.</p> <p>Anyone who has been out of work for two or three months will appreciate how easy it can be to accept almost any offer to get back. There are a lot of cases of clubs being forced to honour the contracts of players they do not want, cases of players who - because of the money they are on - are quite happy to stay put even if it means not being in the first-team squad.</p> <p> These days, one has to have a very good reason for releasing players, and even then, the decision can take you into a legal minefield. About 18 months ago, the 30 schoolboy players we released from our School of Excellence included an Asian lad. As with the others, we did not think he was of the required standard - it was as simple as that. But, amazingly, we have found ourselves being taken to court for racial discrimination. And I am particularly concerned about the danger of managers and players becoming impetuous.</p> <p>If players run into problems with their clubs, I am not sure that they will be as prepared to tackle and overcome them as they might have been before. As for the managers, the best way I can sum it up is to say that when Coventry are beaten, and have not played well, my first reaction is to get rid of six players. I think we all feel that way initially - but by Monday morning, the hitlist has been reduced to three and by the following Friday, there is nobody on it at all and you are friends with everyone again. If getting rid of players was made easier for me, I am not sure that this would be the case. </p> <p>I leave it to you to decide whether the players most at risk would be those earning more money than me.</p>",
  "<p>It seemes after only 20 minutes' play that champagne corks would be popping in the home team's dressing room here for the second time in a week. Alex Tudor had dismissed Jon Lewis and Simon Katich, Durham's principal batsman, with successive balls. </p> <p>One requisite for Surrey clinching the title on the day was met within the first hour after lunch, in that Durham, who had inflicted on the champions a heavy defeat in the opening match of their campaign, had this time bowed the knee. </p> <p> Lancashire, however, were less co-operative, capturing a full hand of bonus points. Now the only way the issue could be settled before sunset was if the pitches committee, convened to sit in judgment on the state of the Old Trafford strip later in the day, imposed a points penalty. </p> <p>But the scenes enacted in front of the pavilion here suggested that the championship was again in Surrey's bag. Their supporters gathered under their balcony, chanting and cheering, and the players came out to join in the celebrations. They were indeed premature, for Lancashire were on their way to a fifth batting point and, weather permitting, a likely victory. </p> <p>The light, when play began, was only just bright enough for Adam Hollioake to throw Alex Tudor into the attack at the Vauxhall End. With his third ball he had Lewis, caught on the crease, lbw and then greeted Katich with one that left him late to find the edge. </p> <p> Tudor was not kept in the attack for long and Saqlain Mushtaq bowled three uneventful overs before Tudor returned. But Ian Salisbury, Durham's tormentor in the first innings, wheeled away from the Pavilion End. Trying to stop a violent straight pull by Michael Gough off his own bowling, he deflected the ball on to the stumps with non-striker Paul Collingwood out of his crease and Durham, who were following on 212 runs behind, were 30 for three. </p> <p>Salisbury also participated in Gough's dismissal by holding a low catch at extra-cover from a drive at Tudor and then toppled Jimmy Daley, who offered no stroke to a prodigious googly. But his control and venom diminished as the morning wore on, and Durham took lunch without suffering any further casualties. </p> <p> It was not that the partnership that held up Surrey for 23 overs was entirely secure. Andrew Pratt, left-handed, was either playing and missing against Tudor or making contact with the edge and collecting boundaries, which inflated his contribution to 31. </p> <p>Also, he had got away with a chance to short-leg before he had scored, and then sliced a drive which bisected the gap between first and second slips at catchable height. However, Pratt's partner, Martin Speight, was completely assured. Familiar with Salisbury's bag of tricks from having kept wicket to him in their Sussex days, he eagerly preyed on anything loose. So much so that Salisbury was taken off ater conceding 18 runs in five overs after lunch. </p> <p>Pratt's charmed life was ended by Martin Bicknell when he groped forward and edged to the first of two gullies, and Durham's last four wickets could resist for no more than another 38 minutes. </p>",

  "<p><strong> Tantrums in Florence</strong> </p> <p>Are these the bitterest fans in football? Supporters of Fiorentina - furious about the \u00a322.8m sale of hairy icon Gabriel Batistuta earlier this year - have walked out on the club. Last season Fiorentina sold 32,505 season tickets. This year they've barely scraped 5,000. Batistuta's departure in June was the most violently received transfer of recent times. When the Argentine announced his plans, fans began days of massive 'Please don't go' riots: three Molotov cocktails were thrown at the office of club president Vittorio Cecchi Gori, 500 fans surrounded the stadium, and 50 others held a candle-light vigil outside Batistuta's villa with a banner declaring: 'Florence loves you. You love Florence. So why leave?' Money would seem to have been a factor - but the fans remain appalled. Now, upset again by the appointment of unglamorous Turkish coach Faith Terim and his subsequent failure to sign Barcelona's Boudewijn Zenden, fans have deserted the club in droves, and more direct action could follow. In 1990, Roberto Baggio moved to rivals Juventus, and was the subject of furious death threats - almost fulfilled when a group of fans broke into the Italian national camp in Coverciano to try to reach him. If Fiorentina win their first couple of games, season ticket sales will no doubt recover. If not, it'll be a quiet few months at the Artemio Franchi. </p> <p> <strong> Divine Bambino: cash rolls in</strong> </p> <p>Vincenzo Sarno - the Italian preteen 'Bambino of God' profiled in Said &amp; Done in January last year - has returned home to Napoli after his remarkable \u00a350,000 move to Turin broke down. Vincenzo, discovered by Europe's money men after scouts reported a ten-year-old miniature Maradona with perfect ball control, joined Torino - 500 miles from home - when the club offered his unemployed father a car, a house and tens of millions of lira. 'You don't realise what this adventure means for us,' protested father Ernesto when the move was condemned as 'soccer paedophilia'. 'I haven't slept in days. I stay awake at night thinking, \"The new Maradona was born in my house.\" I can't believe it.' But less than a year after the boy's first training session in Turin, financial disputes and an unhappy Vincenzo ('My friends miss me') have forced the family home. But he won't be there for long. After a recent promotional tour of New York, where the youngster made the rounds of the morning talk shows, little Vincenzo is again the subject of interest from Roma and Juventus. And with all the money from the Turin move gone, Ernesto's keen to do business. 'This season he'll be in a soccer school in Napoli,' he says. 'He can have a break. But he's still young - only 12. We have time.' </p> <p><strong> Rooms with a pew</strong> </p> <p>Twenty-two nuns have opened a bed and breakfast at their Merseyside convent in an attempt to cash in on fans visiting Liverpool and Everton. The Augustinian Sisters hope the venture will provide much-needed resources, and encourage supporters to stay and pray. 'We decided to open a guesthouse to help us pay the bills,' says Sister Carmel, deputy mother superior. 'Our location means we should get a lot of trade.' The nuns are charging \u00a320 for bed and breakfast, and \u00a35 extra for a homemade dinner, served by the sisters. 'We think this is good value,' said Sister Carmel. Important facts for prospective guests : Saint Augustine, Bishop of Hippo, North Africa, died in 430BC, and is patron saint of brewers. Key Augustinian rules: 1. Chant only what is prescribed for chant; moreover, let nothing be chanted unless it is so prescribed. 2. Subdue the flesh, so far as your health permits, by abstinence from drink. 3. Although your eyes may chance to rest upon some woman or other, you must not fix your gaze. An abomination to the Lord is he who fixes his gaze.

  "<p>The Wombles of Wimbledon make a living clearing rubbish, but even they might have baulked at the detritus Sheffield Wednesday's defence left behind here. It took the Dons 50 minutes to find the net, but after 21-year-old Damien Francis volleyed the ball home from 10 yards when Wednesday's defence had played head tennis with Neil Ardley's corner, the floodgates opened. </p> <p>John Hartson, the multi-million-pound striker no one apparently wants to buy, tarted up his shop window image. In the space of three minutes he scored twice. Both goals derived from an old-fashioned striker's determination to shrug off defenders and force a shooting chance. Andy Hinchcliffe, Des Walker and Ashley Westwood were Wednesday's guilty men, though credit to Hartson - particularly for the second of his goals which was accomplished in spite of the fact that he was never really balanced. </p> <p>Then Jason Euell, left to his own devices in the six-yard box, twice taunted Kevin Pressman by rolling the ball across the keeper's diving body before scoring his first. Hartson then turned provider with an inch-perfect pass that left Euell clear for a simple shot from six yards. </p> <p>Wednesday's humiliation could have been greater, with players queuing up in the closing minutes to take a whack at poor Pressman. The home defence were in ruins. Walker, for so long a prince of defenders, has lost the pace that bought him so much time, and his central defensive partner Westwood looked completely outclassed by first Hartson and then Euell. </p> <p>In the first half Wednesday had shown flashes of cohesion. Their under-19 England midfielder Matthew Hamshaw had set up the club's latest Italian import, Michele Di Piedi, for a header which was wastefully off tar get. And Gerald Sibon and Phil O'Donnell both had Kelvin Davis racing to the edge of his area diving at their feet. </p> <p>But for most of the game they were second best to a Wimbledon who were smarter, more skilful and more determined. Wednesday's manager, Paul Jewell, has invited his squad in for training this morning. He said: 'The players are ashamed, and rightly so. Once the first goal went in they threw the towel in. I was disgusted with their lack of commitment.' </p> <p>It's always a bad sign at a League game when you can hear the players calling each other. There were acres of space at Hillsborough and the cavernous stadium is unlikely to see its terraces filled again with performances like this.</p>",
  "<p>Things just keep getting better for Celtic. Their 100 per cent start was maintained here courtesy of an emphatic victory over Hibernian, thereby replacing their Edinburgh opponents at the top of the table. News of Rangers' stumble at Dundee only enhanced the buoyant mood. </p> <p>Two goals from Henrik Larsson and a late strike from substitute Mark Burchill ended Hibs' unbeaten run as Martin O'Neill's side served awesome warning of their title credentials. </p> <p>O'Neill has clearly given Celtic some resilience but it was complemented here by a considerable flair and it was again Larsson who led the way. </p> <p>The pressure on the Hibernian defence was relentless from the first whistle as the home side made a whirlwind start. Jackie McNamara conjured up the first clear-cut chance when he cut into the box from the right wing before shooting powerfully just past the post. </p> <p>The home side's tails were clearly up and Lubomir Moravcik tried his luck from over 20 yards out in the thirteenth minute with a dipping drive which Nick Colgan did well to push over. </p> <p>Celtic's confidence was replaced by concern in the 14th minute when Alan Stubbs collided with team-mate Paul Lambert and the defender was carried off. </p> <p>But those worries were forgotten after 19 minutes when the home side took the lead. Colgan came rushing out to clatter into Alan Thompson on the very edge of the box before Larsson slotted home from the spot. </p> <p>The visitors did make a rare break into the Celtic half in the 23rd minute it almost brought them an equaliser when John O'Neill ran through unchallenged before hitting a right-footed drive that keeper Jonathan Gould brilliantly saved to his left. </p> <p>Celtic, however, pressed for a second and their relentless pressure paid off at the close of the first half. After Chris Sutton glanced a header wide from Thompson's free-kick, and Moravcik shot straight at Colgan after being played clean through, Celtic doubled their lead when Lambert brilliantly played the ball out to Moravcik on the left flank and his precise cross was headed in by Larsson. </p> <p>The home side began where they left off after the restart and Thompson went agonisingly close a minute into the second period when his 20-yard shot flew inches wide. </p> <p>The former Aston Villa player was looking for his second goal in as many games and on 58 minutes he hit a venomous 25-yard free-kick just past the post. </p> <p>Larsson himself had the scent of a hat-trick and only another great stop from Colgan denied the Swede a treble after he hit a first-time effort from just inside the box. </p> <p>However, Hibs were refusing to fold and in the 79th minute they jolted the home side out of their complacency when Stuart Lovell's close range effort brought a brilliant save from Gould. </p> <p>This sparked Celtic back into life and with nine minutes left Sutton and McNamara should have secured the points when the \u00a36million forward rounded Colgan on the ground but Franck Sauzee cleared off the line and McNamara fired wildly over from the rebound. </p> <p>Nevertheless there was still a time for Celtic to score their third goal in the closing seconds as Sutton beat the offside trap and unselfishly squared the ball to Burchill who side-footed into the empty net.</p>",

  "<p>Halfway between the villages of Talybont and Pontsticill in mid-Wales is a hill which walkers have long climbed to enjoy spectacular views from the summit over the Brecon Beacons. Climb that hill today and you will see ruts up to six foot deep and huge bald patches where the vegetation has been eroded. 'It looks like a battlefield,'says Sue Mabberley, head warden at the Brecon Beacons National Park. </p> <p>The cause of the damage is four-wheel-drive vehicles: the increasing popularity of off-road driving as a recreation has become a major environmental problem for the National Parks and a nuisance for residents and other park users. The sharp increase in ownership of four-wheel drives has been matched by a rise in the number of commercial operators offering 'jeep safaris' for tourists and corporate entertainment. </p> <p>The problem is not confined to Wales. Other areas of rugged terrain such as the Yorkshire Dales, North Yorkshire Moors and the Lake District are facing similar issues. </p> <p>Bob Cartwright, head of park management for the Lake District National Park Authority has identified 146 routes within the park which are regularly used by 4WD vehicles, sometimes in convoys up to 17 vehicles long. 'It is a fundamentally inappropriate activity for a national park and we have been increasingly concerned about the impact on the landscape and local communities,' he said. </p> <p>'In upland areas where the soil is thin or fragile heavy vehicles rip through the soil affecting the habitat and plant life, but it also impacts on other recreational users such as ramblers, horseriders and cyclists when a path becomes a quagmire. We've had incidents where a path was so bad that a farmer couldn't reach his stock to feed them and a horse had to be put down because it got caught in a bog.' </p> <p>Efforts to control the problem by putting up no entry signs on paths and a code of conduct for offroad vehicles have had minimal impact. </p> <p>The Countryside and Rights of Way Bill, now going through parliament will designate certain roads as Restricted Byways - putting the onus on motorists to prove a precedent of vehicular access before they can use it. </p> <p>However, Cartwright and many of his national park colleagues believe that nothing short of a complete ban will suffice. </p> <p>British Off Road Driving Association chairman Richard Beddall believes the solution is not to place restrictions on roads but on drivers. 'I have a lot of sympathy with the national parks but they are fighting the wrong battle,' he said. 'It's not a question of regulating the ground but regulating the people with some kind of basic training. There are lots of people charging about the countryside in four-wheel drive vehicles who are totally ignorant. You have to have a license to drive on the road so why not have one for driving offroad too?' </p> <p>Reputable clubs such as the All Wheel Drive Club and Association of Landrover Clubs offer training and environmental guidelines but these clubs only account for around 20 per cent of off-road drivers. </p> <p>Sue Mabberley fears the problem will get worse before anything is done: 'We get letters all the time asking us why we aren't doing something about the problem, but our hands are tied.'</p>",
  "<p>'C'mon, mate. Are ya a bloke or a Sheila? Git it down ya' nick!' </p> <p>With his hanging corks hat and khaki shorts, Mick encapsulated almost every Australian stereotype, needing just a can of Foster's in his hand to complete the effect. Mick, a wizened, red-coloured man in his sixties, was the owner of the Johnstone River Crocodile Farm. This was one of the stops offered by Oz Experience, the tour company facilitating my journey along Queensland's east coast, and as I looked down at the greasy crocodile kebab that was dripping down my hand, I was beginning to wonder if this was one Oz experience too far. </p> <p>'It's not gonna bite ya, mate. It's dead!' </p> <p>Mick knew all about being bitten by crocs. In his 20 years at the farm he had accrued an impressive collection of scars and maulings, yet his enthusiasm for sitting on and taunting the beasts was undimmed. </p> <p>The Johnstone River Crocodile Farm lies a couple of hours south of Cairns and is ideally situated in the middle of croc country, the lush, marshy lands at the foot of the Atherton Tablelands. In this area it is not unknown for crocodiles to walk through the centre of towns like Innisfail during periods of drought, causing all kinds of traffic problems. The farm is home to more than 1,500 crocodiles of varying sizes, some captive-reared and some from the wild, as well as some that are shaped like handbags and boots. It is run as a profit organisation, selling skins and meat throughout Australia, although if the kebab I was holding in my hand was typical of the fare that they offered I would guess that most of their income comes from skins. Tentatively, I raised the yellowish meat to my mouth and took a small bite. </p> <p>'About bloody time too!' Mick commented impatiently as the rest of the group gave me a patronising round of applause. </p> <p>The meat had a strange, jelly-like quality, almost as if I was eating brain, but Mick pointed out that crocodile brain would scarcely be large enough to provide an hors d'oeuvre , and only the tail of the creature is consumed. The look on my face was enough to dissuade anybody else from sampling the delights of reptile cuisine and we moved on into the farm. </p> <p>Upon entrance, each of us had been asked to reveal our nationality to a skinny, slightly malnutritioned-looking assistant called Tai, with selected nationalities receiving a stamp on their hand. I reckoned that from the look of him Tai didn't much care for crocodile meat either and had been forced to subsist on any roots and nuts that he found growing around the farm. Being English, my compatriots (Phil and Sarah) and I were slightly disappointed not to receive a stamp, but once it became clear what they signified it was a blessed relief. </p> <p>Mick strode on ahead of the group, carrying a bucket of mutilated chicken carcasses to feed the crocs. First stop was a pair of freshwater crocodiles which are kept as pets at the farm. Freshwater crocodiles are of little use economically as they grow too slowly, and it is only the gigantic saltwater crocodiles that end up on skewers or Jimmy Nail's feet. The freshwater crocodiles weren't hungry, so after receiving a tongue-lashing from Mick for their unwillingness to co-operate we moved on to meet Gregory, at six metres long the largest specimen at the farm. </p> <p>'Let's see if he's Gregory Peckish' Mick announced, striding into the enclosure as though it contained nothing more than a few fluffy rabbits. </p> <p>Gregory lay snoozing in the corner of his pen, like an exhausted dinosaur, paying absolutely no attention to Mick as he filled us in on his colourful background. </p> <p>Gregory had been brought to the farm after eating an incautious 18-year-old farm-hand when he had been just a sprightly adolescent at three metres long. Apparently he once had a pretty bad temper, but after almost doubling in size at the farm he had mellowed somewhat and now ate people only rarely. Mick walked straight over to Gregory, sat on the huge monster's back, straddling him like a scaly horse, and placed his hat on his head. Crocodiles are quite sensitive to sunburn, and with the sun beginning to emerge from behind the thick grey cloud that had covered most of Queensland since my arrival, Mick informed us that he was worried about Gregory getting sunstroke. </p> <p>This was when the meaning of the stamps was revealed to us all. Those people that had received a stamp belonged to nationalities that had not yet had a recorded fatality to saltwater crocodiles in Australia. The lucky few included a couple of nervous Belgians, three bemused Dutchmen, a gaggle of drunken Irishmen and a solitary German. It was the German, a lanky, long-haired chap called Axel, who was singled out by Mick. </p> <p>'Where's the bloody German?', he shouted from astride the crocodile, moving his head from side to side like an eagle hunting its prey. Axel, somewhat timidly, stepped forward from the group. He didn't know what he was being called forward for, but you could tell that he wished it was one of the Dutchmen in his place. </p> <p>Mick failed to resist the opportunity to mention the war, citing this as an experiment to see whether Gregory had forgiven the Germans for all the Anzacs who lost their lives, and as he placed a blindfold over Axel's eyes we were still in the dark about exactly what the experiment was going to be. With the blindfold in place, Mick began to steer the terrified Axel, now shaking violently, backwards towards Gregory. </p> <p>'Vot is happening? Vhere are you taking me?' Axel inquired, trying to sound calm, but with a distinctly nervous quiver in his voice. 'I'm gonna feed ya to Greg,' Mick replied bluntly, solving the puzzle. </p> <p>Inexplicably, Axel made no attempt to resist, and when he was about 10 yards from Gregory, Tai, who had sneaked into the enclosure unnoticed, leapt out from behind a tree, smacked the victim's backside with a plastic rake and made a roaring noise like a hungry crocodile. Poor Axel nearly jumped out of his skin, while the rest of us fell about in hysterics. </p> <p>'He wouldn't eat ya, anyway. You'd get stuck in his teeth!' Mick shouted after the trembling German, as he raced to rejoin the group to sympathetic applause. </p> <p>Leaving Gregory behind, Mick tossed a chicken towards him and the great beast came momentarily to life as he lurched forward to catch the bird in mid-air with a great crash of his huge jaws, before resuming his semi-conscious, statuesque pose. Sarah's face went white. </p> <p>We were shown around the rearing pens (swimming pools filled with hundreds of miniature crocodiles that looked quite cute but would apparently bite your fingers off), introduced to the breeding enclosure (where females guarded empty nests that they thought contained eggs but had actually been raided by the owners) and finally shown the cassowary display. </p> <p>This cage contained a pair of colourful, ostrich-like birds with blue necks and helmeted heads and the idea was to begin a breeding programme to reintroduce this endangered species to the wild. The breeding programme had been running for three years, with a success rate at the time of writing of zero per cent, but they hadn't given up hope yet. </p> <p>Apparently it is quite hard for cassowaries to concentrate on the job when they are surrounded by killer crocodiles. </p> <p>The tour ended pretty much back where it had begun, under the tin-roofed visitors' centre with its talking, caged cockatoos. Mick hadn't given up trying to plug his crocodile kebabs, despite the limited interest that they had attracted first time around, and even gave Axel a complimentary kebab, only for him promptly to waste the opportunity for revenge on the reptiles by illicitly handing it on to somebody else. For anybody who hadn't had enough of scaly things, there was a chance to handle a deadly brown snake, which was supposedly very good-natured, quite fortunate considering that one bite would inject you with enough neurotoxins to wipe out a small town. </p> <p>Phil, who had turned into quite the herpetologist over the past couple of hours, was photographed proudly with the snake coiled around his neck. I politely declined the offer of a similar picture. 'We'd best take a head count before you leave, just to make sure that you've got the same number that you came in with,' Mick announced with his screeching Aussie drawl, as we prepared to head on towards Cairns. </p> <p>We were one short. Axel was already on the bus.</p> <p><strong>This year's winner </strong></p> <p>Paul Smith secured his first job in journalism last week, the day before he was declared the winner of The Observer Young Travel Writer of the Year award. He is to be a web-journalist on <a href=\"http://www.yougov.com\">www.yougov.com</a>, an internet site that has a youthful focus on news and politics.

'Afghan' camels, probably from Pakistan, were imported to help build the Ghan railway. Many were then released and large numbers still roam the desert. Others are farmed for meat, tourism and sport, the Camel Cup race being one of Alice Springs' biggest annual events.</p> <p>I've always been slightly suspicious of camels, but my guide assured me that they were just 'misunderstood'. Sure enough, Salty was surprisingly comfortable and didn't spit once. From his back I could easily see over the stunted bushes to the Todd River, flowing beneath its sandy bed.</p> <p>The area is normally sparsely vegetated and characterised by deep red sandy soil. Following recent rain it had turned a vivid green and was teeming with wildlife. The ground appeared to be strewn with ripe apples. These were 'bastard melons', a ground growing vine fruit, so called because they look great but are poisonous. Brightly coloured parrots, galahs and cockatoos flitted among the eucalyptus trees and big spiders lurked between the bushes. Fortunately I was spared any encounters with the deadly snakes that thrive in the region.</p> <p><strong>Jennifer Coyle, 24, a graduate trainee at Reuters, travelled from Darwin to Alice Springs</strong></p> <p>I enjoyed the company of Territorians; straight-talking survivors with a fierce appreciation of their harsh land. Towns are few and far between in the Territory and apart from the former gold-rush settlement at Pine Creek, the next place of any size south of Darwin is Katherine. Here the local Elvis tribute band were performing in the arcade, alongside two beaming teenage girls selling lip balm, with a special 'Buy one, get three free!' offer.</p> <p>Our acerbic guide Tim was a Territory veteran - a former cattle ranger whose tales of life on the vast stations sounded immensely romantic to my city ears. An authority on bush survival, he lectured the pale European visitors sternly on the correct technique for shaking out our 'swags' - the portable sleeping mattresses that we zipped ourselves into after thoroughly evacuating any wildlife. Much to my horror, I had a near miss when an enormous millipede unexpectedly concealed itself in a corner. However, it was undoubtedly a price worth paying for the privilege of sleeping under the light of the Southern Cross and Milky Way at Katherine Gorge, or Nitmiluk as it is called by the Janwoyn tribe that own the land. Tim was mystified with our city dwellers' delight at discovering a night sky that wasn't orange.</p> <p><strong>Hannah Lewis,29, a freelance radio producer, travelled from Sydney to Brisbane</strong></p> <p>In the morning the rain had stopped. One of the group was keen on 'going to look at the hippies' in the neighbouring commune of Nimbin but I declined the offer to join him and decided to try sea-kayaking instead. After my trip around Sydney aquarium, I was apprehensive. The deadly box jellyfish had been on display, safely behind glass and in formaldehyde but accompanied by gruesome photographs of a victim covered in deep lacerations from its poisonous and lengthy tentacles. It might be the wrong time of year for the jellyfish but I had visions of the sea teeming with 'these stingers'. But at the mention of seeing dolphins, I decided I could live with disfiguring welts if need be.</p> <p>As we were getting into our kayaks, fishermen were standing on the shore with a vast net. Every wave that rolled in was lined with thousands of mullet that all came in one size - large. A lone walker was eating chips, unaware that he was being followed by about 50 seagulls. It was a surreal morning.</p> <p>On the open sea giant sea turtles came up for air alongside us and a group of 20 dolphins and their young were swimming close by. We paddled in to a quiet cove for breakfast and walked to the clifftop for a stunning view of the surrounding bays.</p>",

This long quasi-narrative poem follows the movement of the painter Camille Pissarro from his birthplace in St Thomas through to the firmament of Impressionist Paris, and the poet's own artistic and creative quest. In it we move with the narrator in an exploration of artistic awakening, and processes that parallel and connect with those of the artist. </p> <p>This is a complex work about identity, place and time and the problems of reading history and empire ('He was Art's subject as much as any empire's') through the narrative we construct out of memory. The guilt of leaving, the guilt of betrayal, and of self-justification, burn as background. The political points are there ('We are history's afterthought'), but their presentation lacks vitality. </p> <p>Attempts to segue speech and writing into the field of the canvas as well as the page, to examine the rebus nature of visual thought, become repetitive and overplayed. Walcott doesn't do metatext and self-referential poetry particularly well. We get too much of this: 'the stroke, the syllable, planted in the furrows of page and canvas, in varnished pews...' It goes on and on: 'its apostrophe/poised like a gull' and 'My pen replaced a brush'. </p> <p>There is often interesting palimpsesting of places, and the play on the doubt of the apostle St Thomas, on the artist (and poet's) self-doubt, is in tension with a secular reading of the world. In the poetry itself, there is none of the excitement that the narrator senses on first glimpsing the 'vermilion light in a hound's thigh'. The movement through memory, place, and history, is steady rather than emphatic, but there is a deft awareness of the limitations of art: 'except Time is not/narrative'. </p> <p>Clearly, the versifying is the work of a craftsman - the pentameter rolls across the page, the interconnected couplets rhyming abab to maintain the narrative flow without closing off as traditional heroic couplets might; but there is a lack of vitality that, on occasions, drags the work into the doldrums. The Walcott paintings included with the text are competent, but as dated and drab as the verse technique, and their inclusion bewildering except in terms of the aims of a gift book. </p> <p>It would be nice to see more rage and less quiet. Stillness and poise and grace centre the European eye - a more persistent paranoid vision might better reveal the deep obfuscations and abstractions that inform the great wrongs of colonial history, the evils of false social contracts. Walcott knows this well. </p> <p>And he knows about the fragility of authority and the narrative voice: 'My inexact and blurred biography is like his painting; that is fiction's treason to deny fact, alter topography to its own map...'. Not a masterpiece, but had it been half the length and a little more intense both in form and language, it might well have been. </p> <p>John Burnside has the potential to produce a masterpiece. His language usage is recognisably his own, and his sense of the line is accomplished. His new volume <strong> The Asylum Dance</strong> carries a number of flawed and indifferent poems, but, in the main, is a stunning manual of the lyrical art. While Pissarro guides Walcott, it's Munch that Burnside summons up. </p> <p>This is a book of half-lights, wraiths and ghosts. It's the in-between world of 'presence' and 'absence', concepts that in some ways correlate to Gerard Manley Hopkins's 'inscape' and 'instress', but in the main capture an ambivalence, an edginess between the real and imagined, the at-home and wandering.</p> <p>The apparently straightforward lyric is underpinned by cerebral concerns about the way language works. For all its poise and control, this is a book of guilt and pain. The reader is taken on dark dances along the edge, the place between home and away: 'In school we were taught to admire the homing instinct, animate and sharp behind the eyes ignoring this vast delight, this useless motion.' Certain words occur in poem after poem - 'ghost', 'snow' (as guilt and purity), 'traces', and so on. </p> <p>The book builds like therapy. There is a need for security but a hungering for instability. This transforms most often into the geographic, but centres on relationships: 'and I waited for my father to begin unravelling like twine'. Tensions abound. You can draw schematic diagrams over the pages of this book. Between the Pagan and God, the purgatorial and the preordained, the 'hints and traces' of other possible lives, the lists of objects and plants. Lists anchor identity, give the stability that's craved and rejected. 'Ports', 'The Hay Devil', 'Roads', 'Fields', and the title poem are astonishing works. In these poems, nothing is as simple as believing or not believing. </p> <p>Sharon Olds's <strong> Blood, Tin, Straw</strong> continues the themes she has explored in her previous books. Explorations of the self through sexuality, familial relationships, and the exposition of the private, feed these poems, divided into five sections - the three of the title plus 'Fire' and 'Light'. There are some vintage Olds poems in there, but the language rarely lifts off the page. </p> <p>If Olds's poetry is confessional, it's of the variety that is about 'witness' more than locating the authentic self. There are poems of escape: 'I want to be a baby,/I want to be small and naked...'; of love-hate filial relationships: 'but my sperm king/fished me back, and gave me to my mother/to strip and towel-dry, to burnish'; and sex. The associations between sexual pleasure, need, crisis, death, and birth, are unrelenting. The highlight of the volume comes with Olds's self-ironising (or defensiveness) in 'Take The I Out': ' ...I love the I, frail between its flitches, its hard ground and hard sky, it soars between them like the soul that rushes, back and forth, between the mother and the father'.</p>",
  "<p>Five years ago, the smart Hollywood money was on Julia Ormond becoming the new Julia Roberts or the new Meg Ryan. Instead, she went off at a different angle and became the new Geena Davis. Like Davis, Ormond enjoyed a spectacular launch in Hollywood, buoyed by gallons of publicity rocket fuel: a dazzling ascent swiftly followed by a tumble back to earth at the end of a blackened stick. </p> <p>There is something rather Hilaire Belloc about Julia Ormond's story, something a little cautionary. Or rather, there would be if she would only play along with it, cast herself as The Fallen Star, or The Girl From Surrey Who Thought She Was Audrey Hepburn. But one role she's simply not interested in is that of victim. 'For sure, you don't believe the good stuff,' says Ormond, referring to the hullaballoo that surrounded her in 1995 when Legends of the Fall , First Knight and Sabrina all opened more or less simultaneously. 'I mean, the good stuff is just insane - wacky. If you don't take it too much to heart, it does help when the negative stuff hits. And you know the negative stuff is coming. It's got to! What comes up must come down.' </p> <p>And it's true: she did know it was coming. At 29, Ormond hadn't submitted rapturously to the star machine. There were sacrifices she didn't want to make. On-set admirers called her 'formidable' and 'flinty' and 'honest'; unnamed sources grumbled about 'attitude'. Looking back at her earliest interviews, conducted amid a swarm of excitable movie execs and publicists, with superagent Michael Ovitz himself on hand to fetch her glasses of water, you note a rich seam of ho-hum scepticism. 'They seem to be very sure things are going to be a success,' Ormond told Vogue in 1995. 'I'm not being negative about it, but I'm hedging my bets.' </p> <p>Certainly, the timing was unfortunate. Legends of the Fall, where she played the love interest, was quickly followed by First Knight, a hilarious turkey in which a trumpet-sleeved Ormond was Guinevere, torn between Sean Connery and Richard Gere. Then came a remake of Sabrina, in which director Sydney Pollack misguidedly steered her into Audrey Hepburn's ballet pumps. Though she knows Sabrina was a mistake, Ormond has no regrets. 'It was a fantastic learning experience and OK, I got slammed because I wasn't Audrey Hepburn... but you could have predicted that, really, if you'd opened your eyes wide enough. But I was hungry for the learning experience and didn't feel secure enough to say no. You need to be bloody secure to say no.' </p> <p>She knew she was lucky, but she also knew she was out of her depth - not with the acting, but with the stuff that surrounded it. 'The odd thing for me is the focus on looks which happened in the States. I'd always felt that was not going to be a strong point. That made me feel very disturbed, because it never seemed to be about how much hard work was involved. Ever. It was about... \"hazel eyes\". It does help if you can brush that stuff off.' </p> <p>Billed by the publicists as an ing\u00e9nue, Surrey-born Ormond was no such thing, and this may have saved her bacon. After drama school and an advert for cottage cheese, she had spent a decade as a jobbing actor in the UK, carving out a strong reputation on stage (in 1989, she'd won the London Critics' Award for Best Newcomer, in Christopher Hampton's Faith Hope and Charity at the Lyric Hammersmith) and television (in particular, as a drug addict in Traffik) before landing Legends. </p> <p>'I found it all very scary. This fairytale gets built around you - as if you've been walking through the streets and then Sydney Pollack sees you and goes, \"I'll put you in something!\" When really you've gone to drama school and rep and then you've come to London and gone to auditions... and you've worked, solidly, for years. But that all gets forgotten. At first I was a bit indignant about it, and then I realised, \"No, that's what people want, so that's what is given.\" But it's not in your control. It's just what happens to you, and that's what's frightening.' </p> <p>The roles, on the other hand, were a gas. In the UK, 'I'd seemed to play a lot of people who'd slit their wrists or cut off their hair or shot themselves or died of the plague. And if you do anything for too long, it starts to lack edge, to become too easy. Easy is the kiss of death. And so for me what I needed was to get my head out of my bottom, and so to go off and do First Knight - gallivanting around on a horse, with a cape, and knights in blue corduroy - was quite fun.' </p> <p>So Ormond gallivanted for a bit, airing her famous, transfixing smile as required ('You watch her just to wait for it to happen,' wrote one journalist), and then... vanished, at least from the mainstream. Stepping off the red carpet, she took bigger risks. A doomed film version of Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow , directed by Bille August. A three-hour Russian epic, The Barber of Siberia, directed by Nikita Mikhalkov. When she was white-hot she'd been offered the Holy Grail of movie-star accessories, her own production company, and Ormond actually did something with hers, making a documentary about Bosnian women in Serbian detention camps, and working with Harold Pinter on a Karen Blixen short story that she hopes to direct. Last year she married an American who works in e-commerce. </p> <p>For her next trick, she's coming back to the London stage for the first time in nine years. At the Royal Court, in a break from rehearsing David Hare's new play My Zinc Bed , Ormond looks very London, very theatre. She's wearing a black jersey, chinos and navy flipflops, and her hair is rather tangled, as if it hasn't been brushed for days. No make-up. Her face has more character, more shade, than I was expecting. You do find yourself staring at her, just so you won't miss the wild energy that surges across it when she laughs. </p> <p>Ormond hasn't turned her back on film (the marital home is in LA, and The Prime Gig, a comedy co-starring Vince Vaughn and Ed Harris, is in post-production) but the Hare project was too good to miss. What swung it for her? 'The fact that David had written it and David was directing it at the Royal Court and it was a new three-hander. Plus, it's a brilliant play. I'm not making any comment on how we execute it or what we achieve through doing it, but reading it, it's a phenomenal play.' </p> <p>Since there's some sort of unofficial embargo about My Zinc Bed, neither Ormond nor her co-stars Tom Wilkinson and Steven Mackintosh will spell out what actually happens in the play, other than saying that it's about an entrepreneur who recruits a young poet to jazz up his internet empire. Ormond, who plays Elsa, the entrepreneur's wife, says the Hare script outshone every film script that was coming her way. In any case, she'd been keen to get back to theatre. </p> <p>'I ride,' says Ormond, who has a way with analogies, 'and doing theatre after doing film is a bit like doing dressage or showjumping after you've been out for endless hacks, having just a wild old time. You're put through your paces in a different way. And it's not that going out for a hack is wrong or bad, I certainly don't view it as that; it's just that there's something about the dressage, being put through your paces, that makes you better.' </p> <p>Yes, she feels the stakes are high this time around. 'I feel that David took a risk with me. I have a sense that by starting off in the theatre and going off to do films you are seen to sell out in some way. I don't hold truck with that, but you can't stop people from feeling it. So I think people are a little guarded about me. Oh, God! It's never just about the piece. Something else always washes over it.' </p> <p>She's anxious that her own trajectory, her own reputation, should not obscure Hare's work. When she adds, 'But then, my sense is that that' s all something in the past - I've escaped it', she sounds like she really means it. </p> <p>\u0095 My Zinc Bed runs at the Royal Court Theatre, London SW1 (020 7565 5000) until 28 October</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Insider</strong> (1999, 15, Buena Vista, VHS/Rental, DVD/Retail)<br>Michael Mann's dark, paranoid thriller tells the compelling true story of Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a tobacco industry scientist who put his career and life on the line when he blew the whistle on his employers' public lies. The ambling Crowe is matched by the balletic Al Pacino as the dedicated TV producer Lowell Bergman, another man of integrity who risked his own future by challenging CBS's decision to water down the attack on the cigarette manufacturers. Christopher Plummer is equally good as Mike Wallace, the veteran TV reporter who is condemned for his readiness to avoid a damaging showdown with the network's bosses. A complex and adult film, among the best of recent years.</p> <p><strong>The Filth and the Fury</strong> (1999, 15, FilmFour, VHS, DVD/Retail)<br>Julien Temple made his name with The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, a striking 1979 documentary about the two years of the Sex Pistols that had just ended. After much flat-footed fiction, he returns to the Pistols (his title comes from a 1978 Daily Mirror headline), but this time the object is to show them not as Malcolm McLaren's puppets but as self-creations and products of their chaotic times. Johnny Rotten proves to be shrewd and eloquent, and the film vividly recreates that odd period when the Labour Government was running out of control and Margaret Thatcher was preparing to take over.</p> <p><strong>Mansfield Park</strong> (1999, 15, Buena Vista, VHS, Rental)<br>Canadian feminist film-maker Patricia Rozema has brought a revisionist slant to Jane Austen's most problematic novel. She exposes Sir Thomas Bertram's idyllic Northampton as based on Caribbean slave labour and turns the priggish heroine, Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), into a feisty, attractive, would-be writer, more than a match for the wily Crawfords and their wicked city ways. 'This is 1806, for heaven's sake,' the arrogant Mary Crawford (Embeth Davidtz) says, but this entertaining movie lacks a social and moral context. The biggest plus is Harold Pinter's decent, guilt-ridden Sir Thomas.</p> <p><strong>The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp</strong> (1943, U, VCI, DVD/Retail)<br>Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's sophisticated essay on British life from the turn of the century to World War II is one of the greatest products of our native cinema. It unfolds in flashback through the eyes of a dim, upright soldier (Roger Livesey) and turns on his relationship with a shrewd German friend and rival (Anton Walbrook in superb form). Balanced and thoughtful though it is, Churchill tried to prevent it being shown in the US. It's being issued with another Powell-Pressburger masterpiece, Black Narcissus (1947, U), an elegant melodrama about the agonies and ecstasies of Anglican nuns in India.</p>",
  "<p>Eliza Carthy, catalytic converter of English folk music, has been leading a double life. For the past three years, the fiddle player and singer has been writing a pop album on the quiet. Carthy, just turned 25, was signed to Warner Bros as a singer-songwriter in 1997 by the A&amp;R man who signed Joni Mitchell and Van Morrison. Since when she's got on with 'being a folkie', in pubs, in Peru, at Glastonbury and Meltdown, as Joan Baez's 'co-mentor' (Joan's word) and on tour with her famous folk parents, Norma Waterson and Martin Carthy. Only now their Liza shares the same PR woman as Madonna. </p> <p>'It's been a secret, my little thing,' she says, brushing crumbs off the table after late Sunday breakfast. Today Liza's hair, usually blue, is green. On the windowsill, Buffy the goldfish is circling to the sound of US popster Pink. The neon purveyor of old English love songs lives in Scotland, in a converted stable south of Edinburgh, nothing but sheep for miles, Scottish boyfriend playing English pipes outside the front door. </p> <p>Angels and Cigarettes , like Carthy on stage, is seductively raw. Aside from a cover of Paul Weller's 'Wildwood', partly chosen so she could 'really belt on it' (she has a fabulous voice), this is Liza laid bare: the wrong blokes, the inadequacies, jealousies and, now she's found the right bloke, the fantasies. Her first songs were, she admits, 'completely unselfconscious'. One of them, 'Whole' - as in 'swallow you whole' - was inspired by 'a really nice thing' someone said to her in bed. In 'The Company of Men', a butter-wouldn't-melt harp intro gives way to: 'I've given blow jobs on couches/ To men who didn't want me any more.' Her dad wrote the tune to this one. </p> <p>Warners, to their credit, appear to have left the feisty former Mercury Prize nominee more or less to her own devices, their main proviso: no traditional music. There are Latin grooves, a 25-piece string section, but she plays fiddle on most tracks, the Yorkshire vowels are intact, and the odd folkism still slips out - the demon lover with 'a flush in his cheek' a 'lass' on the Tube. 'I was really quite paranoid when we started,' Carthy recalls. 'I was like, D'ya want me to go on a diet and learn how to formation dance? They were just looking at me totally bemused, \"Er, no and no\".' The music giant signed an elfin folk babe, however now 'voluptuous' would be more accurate. In the CD notes, she describes 'a period of not wanting to see skinny people doing anything'. She tells me she tries to imagine being on Top of the Pops , 'then I get embarrassed'. (I prefer the Liza who signs off her album credits 'Grrrr!! Aaaargh!!!') Has anyone asked her to lose weight? 'No.'</p> <p>She seems too happy to really care. Liza and boyfriend Ben Ivitsky, fiddle player with the Peatbog Faeries, are learning to play the pipes together (brand new ones made of cherry wood: 'D'ya wanna sniff?'). Ben, also a guitarist, 'wrote most of the album' with her. He gave her a pep talk about 'The Blow Job Song' (its working title): 'You're saying things other women wouldn't say,' he told her. 'You're gonna scare the shit out of loads of blokes.' When I leave the room, they start singing together. </p> <p>Carthy belongs to a musical dynasty. She's sitting beneath a photo of her auntie, Lal Waterson, who wrote two acclaimed albums before her death two years ago. There's a pin-up of Martin Carthy, Sixties folk star, in the loo. And yet the prodigal daughter is about to abandon the family business. </p> <p>'But I'm not,' she hits back. 'My physical output will just totally refute that.' She has just produced her mum's first solo traditional album ('I'm all over that'). She'll still gig with her parents. She plans to set up a production company putting out traditional music and tune books for schools (at this point, Vera Lynn is sailing out of the speakers) and she wants to get traditional instruments into the classroom: 'Kids should be learning to play the bagpipes and the hurdy-gurdy,' she proclaims, brown eyes wide, 'they should be freaking out and clog dancing!' </p> <p>Warners may have signed themselves a Trojan horse with bells on. 'Well what am I gonna do? Am I gonna languish in obscurity going, \"I'm bringing folk music to a wider audience\"? Or am I actually gonna do something about it, use this fortunate signing to satisfy my need for new things, and also my need to get traditional music out into the world?' She's been working the folk circuit since she was 17. 'I'd like to prove to myself that I can do an entirely different job.' </p> <p>She will tour later this year purely as a singer-songwriter. As a consumer, she is 'uncomfortable' listening to them. Flicking through her CDs, she picks out Ben Harper, Ani Di Franco and Beth Orton as exceptions. She 'gets off on' bands: G. Love and Special Sauce, The Prodigy, Little Feat, The Meters, Beck. In alphabetical order, though. 'I don't know what Shaggy's doing in the bloody Bs...' Carthy has a soft spot for Catatonia - and The Corrs. Maybe she's learnt from their fiddle-lite appeal: she says she wants to make folk her 'gimmick' rather than her 'hindrance'. </p> <p>You can see her dilemma. A twentysomething folk singer in the twenty-first century does not compute with most people. Female singer-songwriters who talk dirty (P.J. Harvey, Alanis Morissette, Tori Amos) do. There follows a major rant against one-dimensional Britain - 'Ibiza and Radio 1 and finding out what the fuckin' celebs are up to' - and the fact that if traditional music, 'something I love', goes any more underground, it'll be dead. </p> <p>'We should be getting grants off the Government!' she rails, 'I've been all over the world talking about England and what a fucking great place it is, and people have to keep leaving the folk scene.' Her brother-in-law Saul Rose has just hung up his melodeon. He is now a pharmacist. 'Or you can do what I did,' she says, increasingly anguished, 'work your arse off driving yourself around, getting yourself a record deal, making yourself ill. Unless you do this, you haven't a hope in hell. It's so sad.' Top of the Pops is the least of her worries. </p> <p>Still, a girl's got to get her merchandise right. She wants a 'skate' look, she tells her manager, and shows him her new logo - Liza as an angel with a jaunty halo. So there is life after folk. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Angels and Cigarettes is out on WEA on 18 September</p>"
