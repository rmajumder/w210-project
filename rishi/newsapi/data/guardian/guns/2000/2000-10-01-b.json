  "<p>The dark clouds of last season's relegation are rapidly lifting over Chesterfield. This was the fifth consecutive win for the Division Three pace-setters. So far, so good for an immediate return to Division Two. </p> <p>Manager Nicky Law said afterwards: 'We started slowly but we got the break, and in the second half we were magnificent. That's the sign of a good team that we still scored four when we weren't at our best throughout. Of course, we aim to win every game. It's our goal to get promoted, but there's still a long way to go. Today the other results went for us, but we just have to think of ourselves and keep winning.' </p> <p>Law was a rather surprising appointment as manager in the close season after the departure of John Duncan - there had even been rumours of a Nigel/Brian Clough double act - but he has been inspirational. He has brought in half a dozen new faces and the side have blended immediately. </p> <p>Macclesfield may have hoped that Chesterfield's 4-0 midweek defeat at Craven Cottage would have knocked them off their stride, especially when striker David Reeves limped off after nine minutes, and Richard Barker scored following a Steve Payne error. </p> <p>But a Ryan Williams-inspired comeback saw Chesterfield score twice in two minutes, with a third on the stroke of half-time. </p> <p>Williams, who has already scored five times this season, was first to a Beckett cross from the left and his shot cannoned in off defender Darren Tinson. Williams then raced virtually the length of the field after a quickly taken free-kick. Roger Willis knocked Williams's right-wing cross back across goal and Sean Parrish smashed it in after Tony Bullock failed to hold the ball. </p> <p>Parrish scored his second after Karl Monroe had failed to block Marcus Ebdon's cross, striking sweetly past Bullock from eight yards. The contest was over after an hour, Parrish completing his hat-trick following a twice-taken penalty after Macclesfield defenders were judged to have encroached the area.</p>",

  "<p>Sunny blue skies and snow-covered mountains may just be memories in the photograph album. It is time, however, to think about skiing again. Enthusiasts enjoyed good snow last winter, even if greedy millennium prices and a late Easter left some larger tour operators with fewer customers than they had hoped. Many smaller, independent companies did well, against the trend. </p> <p>About 770,000 Britons went skiing last year, a drop of 105,000 on the previous season. About 450,000 bought packages, 199,000 went independently and 119,000 took a school trip. Those who missed out last time seemed to be booking earlier than usual, which is why you ought to start concentrating on the brochures now. </p> <p>The weak euro works wonders for prices. Although Easter is relatively late - on 15 April - the Christmas and New Year transfers fall much more conveniently, with Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve on Sundays. </p> <p>The French ski schools have at last recognised the qualifications of British instructors. Some troubled beginners may miss the good old days when you could always blame your helplessness on not being able to understand what your French instructor was trying to tell you. But this change of attitude by the French will mean that British tour companies can again offer their clients English-speaking instruction and the popular ski guiding service. </p> <p>Last winter Austria was officially shunned by its European partners after the far-Right leader J\u00f6rg Haider's Freedom Party won ministerial places for the first time in a coalition government with the conservative People's Party, but generally skiers refused to join the boycott and after respectable snow, the traditional British favourite is again selling well. </p> <p> Italy didn't have the best of snow, and it remains to be seen whether the resorts and tourist offices can recoup some of last year's lost bookings. Only <strong>Cortina </strong> seems to have got off to a cracking start by announcing it will open on 1 December come what may, thanks to artificial snow. </p> <p><strong> Andorra</strong> is still spending heavily on lift improvements as it projects itself as more than just a cheap destination. <strong> Bulgaria</strong> has consolidated its position with bargain-hunters and the strong pound means that <strong> Switzerland </strong> almost feels affordable. </p> <p>Outside Europe, North America beckons. <strong> Canadian </strong> resorts are threatening to show their ski-tails to their US competitors, many of which had shaky early snowfalls last year and won't be helped by the strengthening of the American dollar against sterling. <strong> Vail</strong>, in Colorado, has regained its position as the top North American resort in the annual poll by Ski Magazine.<strong> Whistler</strong>, in Canada, which knocked it off the top spot last year, is down to third behind <strong> Deer Valley</strong>, Utah. <strong> Aspen</strong>, in fifth below <strong> Sun Valley</strong>, is pushing its $39-a-day lift-ticket offer for those booking before the end of November. <strong> Jackson Hole</strong>, Wyoming, tops the list for best terrain. </p> <p>The Canadian dollar isn't quite so cheap for us as last year but the Canadians are cock-a-hoop about their ski prospects. Konrad Bartelski, three times a British Olympic skier and long a fan of Canadian resorts, says exciting options are opening up in less-known resorts such as <strong> Fernie, Silver Star</strong> and <strong> Big White</strong>. Snow in the western resorts is very reliable. </p> <p>Despite all the hype, it is essential to put the whole North American ski scene into perspective. About 50,000 British skiers are expected to cross the Atlantic, compared with 750,000 who will head for European slopes this season. </p> <p><strong> What's New</strong></p> <p><strong>1. The specialist brochures</strong></p> <p> The demand, it seems, is for luxury. The best hotels and the most luxurious chalets are being taken first. Last-minute bookers who hang on to see whether snow conditions are good can expect to pay above the odds. And while the low-cost airlines do have bargain fares, remember, you have to book early for the best prices and then allow for the cost of travelling from the airport to the resorts, which can dent a modest budget. </p> <p>I had a taste of luxury chalets in the French Alps last February in<strong> Lotus Supertravel's </strong> (020 7962 9933) 'superchalet' Founets, just by the Bellecote piste in Courchevel 1850, and in <strong> Ski Beat's</strong> (01243 780405) chalet Annika, the most luxurious in La Plagne. </p> <p><strong> Erna Low</strong> (020 7584 2841), now represents the MGM luxury apartments. Besides being architecturally exciting, they are set beside the slopes in eight top French resorts and most have indoor swimming pools. </p> <p><strong> Ski Independence </strong> (0870 600 1462), best known perhaps for its holidays to 35 North American resorts, also has a busy ski-drive programme to 25 resorts in France and Switzerland. <strong> Motours</strong> (01892 677777) tops both these for choice with 63 ski-drive destinations in France, Switzerland, Austria and Italy. </p> <p>The advantage of talking to a specialist chalet company is that its staff know the resorts and even the individual chalets intimately. Many concentrate on the great French ski areas, Val d'Is\u00e8re, the Trois Vall\u00e9es and La Plagne. Among these are <strong> Le Ski </strong> (0870 754 4444) which runs its own ski school and is opening its own bar in Courchevel 1650,<strong> Finlays</strong> (01835 830562), and <strong> Meriski</strong> (01451 843100). Some specialise in one resort. Others such as <strong> Ski Esprit</strong> (01252 618300) and <strong> Ski Famille</strong> (01223 363777) concentrate on looking after children. </p> <p><strong> The Ski Club of Great Britain </strong> (020 8410 2022) - subscriptions are \u00a345 per person and \u00a366 for a family - offers an eclectic selection of holidays for skiers of all standards. There are special holidays for the over-fifties, for off-piste enthusiasts and even weeks for unaccompanied teenagers. </p> <p><strong> Ski Lagrange</strong> (020 7371 6111) has expanded its programme to include La Clusaz, La Rosi\u00e8re among 38 others in France and Andorra. <strong> Flexiski </strong> (0870 909 0754) has added St Moritz and St Christoph, home of the 100-year-old Arlberg Ski Club, to the five prestigious resorts it already sells. </p> <p><strong> Stanford Skiing</strong> (020 8789 2929), which uses only Meg\u00e8ve, has bought another hotel to cope with increased demand. </p> <p><strong> Inntravel</strong> (01653 629010), best known for relaxed holidays in mountain villages, is offering special weeks for novices to learn cross-country or downhill skiing. </p> <p><strong> Scott Dunn Ski</strong> (020 8767 0202), which headed the British discovery of Jackson Hole in the Nineties, concentrates more now on chalets and hotels in Zermatt and three French resorts. </p> <p> Directory of Ski Holidays available free. Phone the Association of Independent Tour Operators on 020 8607 9080. </p> <p><strong> 2. The big operators</strong></p> <p> The major firms, which singed their fingers last season, are hoping to bounce back using fat brochures full of enticements and a vast variety of resorts. </p> <p><strong> Crystal </strong> (0870 848 7000), which sells more holidays than any other operator, goes to 122 resorts in 11 countries, and has learn-to-ski-or-snowboard packages for 37 resorts. Many of its prices are lower than last year's. </p> <p><strong> Thomson </strong> (0870 606 1470) goes to more than 80 resorts in 11 countries and is strong on snowboarding. It has added 12 resorts including Alpach a friendly Austrian village.. </p> <p><strong> Inghams</strong> (020 8740 4433) is fighting back after a market reverse a couple of winters ago. </p> <p>As well as its usual brochure offering 10 countries, it has has another under its Bladon Lines brand for chalets and club hotels - the hot thing on the cold slopes - as well as a luxury brochure covering 44 resorts in seven countries. </p> <p><strong> First Choice </strong> (0870 754 3477) offers eight countries with club hotels mainly in France. </p> <p><strong> Neilson</strong> (08705 141414), with 11 countries, is offering \u00c5re in Sweden, Obergurgl in Austria and Vail for the first time. </p> <p> Get the big operators' brochures from travel agents, or phone them direct. </p> <p><strong>3. On the mountain</strong></p> <p> Greater environmental awareness has largely halted the expansion of ski areas into untouched valleys. Resorts are now more likely to concentrate on improving their lifts. Paradoxically, one of the exceptions is <strong> Vail</strong>, which last season suffered a series of arson attacks including the destruction of a large mountain-top restaurant complex. The resort has expanded into the <strong> Blue Sky Basin</strong> and is opening more terrain there this winter. </p> <p>There is less opposition to improving existing ski lifts, even though bigger ones spill even more skiers on to already busy pistes. I'm only just getting used to six-seater chairlifts, but soon I'll have to try one carrying eight. There has been one at <strong> Vradal</strong>, in Norway since 1997, and <strong> Nauders</strong>, in Austria, installed one last year. Now comes news that six more eight-seaters are to be unveiled: in <strong> M\u00e9ribel, Flaine </strong> and <strong> Les Deux-Alpes</strong> (which is promising two) in France, and in <strong> Ischgl </strong> and <strong> Hopfgarten</strong> in Austria. Each can lift up to 3,600 skiers an hour. </p> <p>Also in Austria <strong> Filzmoos</strong> is replacing single-seaters with quads, there are upgrades to gondolas at <strong> Lech </strong> and <strong> Mayrhofen</strong>, new gondolas at <strong> Hintertux, S\u00f6lden, S\u00f6ll</strong> and <strong> St Anton</strong>, and a new six-seater at <strong> Seefeld</strong>. </p> <p><strong>What it costs</strong></p> <p>No one can pretend that skiing is the cheapest of holidays. A family of four driving to self-catering accommodation in a French Alps centre may pay about \u00a335 per person per day sharing in January. A package holiday - flights, transfers, hotel half-board - doesn't go much below \u00a3300 per person per week in January and at the end of the season. Add to these prices the cost of lifts, ski school and, if necessary, ski and boot hire, and you're looking at at least \u00a3500 a head. If economy is paramount, check the brochures for Andorra, Bulgaria and Slovenia.</p> <p><strong>Diary dates</strong></p> <p>The British school half-term week starts on Saturday 17 February. The French ski holidays stretch from Saturday 3 February to Sunday 4 March. You have been warned...</p> <p><strong>Free to first-timers</strong></p> <p>Some experts are worried that the average age of skiers is growing and there are too few newcomers. Vail has even started charging the over-70s, who used to ski for free. To encourage newcomers, nine nations have formed the Association of Snowsports Countries. Thirty resorts spread over five of them - Austria, France, Slovenia, Switzerland and the US - are offering a week's free lift pass, free tuition and free hire equipment to any first-time skiers or snowboarders from 20-27 January. Ask your tour operator for details.</p>",
  "'You are now entering Free Derry' the slogan painted in black letters on a white wall, has become one of the most enduring images of the Troubles. It has been seen over and over again on television often as the background to violent clashes between the security forces and the people of the Bogside. <p> Over the years most of the Sinn Fein leaders associated with the long march from armed rebellion to political respectability have addressed the supporters here. Just across the road a youthful Martin McGuinness, at that time an IRA leader in Derry, made his first public speech. It was short and to the point: 'It doesn't matter what John Hume says. We'll fight on until we get a united Ireland.' </p> <p> Now Free Derry Corner is to become, officially, a national monument. Last week an alliance of Sinn Fein and the SDLP on the city council voted that the area should be handed over to the Department of the Environment's Heritage Service. The Minister who will be responsible for looking after it is Sam Foster, an Ulster Unionist member of the new power sharing executive. </p> <p> It is a potent symbol of changing times. The slogan 'You are now entering Free Derry' was first painted on to the gable end of a small terraced house in the Bogside in 1969. It was during an uneasy period when the Civil Rights movement was holding massive rallies to protest against discrimination but before the Army was sent to Northern Ireland. The row of cramped houses was later demolished but the gable wall was left standing by itself and the area became known as Free Derry Corner. </p> <p> It was a focal point of republican defiance. Each year the march held to commemorate Bloody Sunday in Derry, when 13 marchers were shot by the British soldiers, ended with a rally here. It was at this wall that Bernadette Devlin spoke to reporters when she was released from jail. </p> <p> Free Derry Corner has changed in recent years as peace has become a reality. There are landscaped flowerbeds. On nearby walls large and graphic murals depict key moments of the area's history over the past 30 years. </p> <p> It has become a tourist attraction. American visitors come in coachloads. Sometimes a group of British squaddies, coming to the end of a tour of duty, will venture up to Free Derry Corner to have their photographs taken. But the old revolutionary spirit persists. Local groups campaigning on such contentious issues as abortion and gay rights use the back of the wall to put across their message. </p> <p> Free Derry Corner was not the only historic monument in the city to change hands last week. By a pleasant irony the Ministry of Defence announced that Fort George, which has been the Army's headquarters in the west side of Derry for almost 30 years, is to be handed back to its original owners. The Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners planned to build a flagship commercial development on the 15-acre site. </p> <p> The decision to leave Fort George is part of the Government's programme to reduce the security presence in Northern Ireland. Six Army bases along the border in Co Fermanagh are also to be demolished. The Army points out that 40 military bases and installations have been closed down since 1995. At the moment there are 13,500 soldiers in the province. The hope is that, all being well, this figure will be cut to 8,000. Sinn Fein describes this process as demilitarisation. The Army prefers the more hopeful term normalisation. Unionists have been critical of this scaling down of the Army presence, which they claim is being done to pander to the IRA. </p> <p> Others see it as part of a deliberate strategy to extract concessions from the IRA to help David Trimble. </p> <p> The issue of policing and the demands of nationalist leaders for a full implementation of the Patten Report make it very difficult for the Government to move on that front. But a dramatic gesture from the IRA, such as another inspection of its arms dumps by internationally respected figures, might help Trimble fend off his critics. </p> <p> It often seems that the peace process in Northern Ireland simply lurches from crisis to crisis. But at a political level there has been much more steady progress. Last week Trimble, accompanied by most of his Ministers, came to Dublin for the second plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council. In Belfast, the names of 60 members of the new Civic Forum were announced. This will act as a wide-ranging consultative body to the assembly. </p> <p> This is how peace is built - slowly and with great difficulty. It will take a long time to complete the long journey from armed conflict to reconciliation. But in Derry at least, people believe that it is time to move on. Free Derry Corner is now seen as part of the city's history, a place for respect and conservation, but no longer a rallying point for rebellion against the state.</p>",
  "<p>The fact that Simphiwe happened to be sitting outside a bar on the main street in Hankey when he saw the tikoloshe was strictly coincidence. He hadn't had a single drink; he was only 12 then. He was sitting with his friend Michael and the tikoloshe went by on the other side of the street, right outside the bank, and Simphiwe turned to Michael to say, 'Look! A tikoloshe !' By which time the tikoloshe had vanished. 'But he was there, no doubt,' Simphiwe assured me. </p> <p>A tikoloshe is a mischievous creature with magical powers, about half the size of a man, naked, ugly, extremely hairy and, perhaps just as well, generally invisible. He is the consort of witches and will do their bidding. He lives among the reeds of the river, but regularly comes to town to steal eggs and terrorise the population. </p> <p>Simphiwe (pronounced 'Simpeewe') was now 19 and fully conversant with what Harry Potter would call the 'Dark Arts'. He lived among witches (igqwira in the Xhosa tongue) and witch doctors (igqira), spirits and mermaids. 'You think a witch rides around on the broomstick? That is ridiculous!' he laughed, amused by my naivety. 'No. A witch goes on a flying loaf of bread.' The loaf is, in fact, a snake or serpent which only looks like a loaf, as a kind of disguise. </p> <p>Simphiwe, who tended to wear his baseball cap sideways, had both a sharp sense of humour and a serious respect for the supernatural. We met in the legendary Jeffrey's Bay. Surfers come to these far-flung shores in the Eastern Cape region of South Africa for classic waves that sweep up out of Antarctica during the winter, and come here to die spectacularly. But for the week-long professional surfing contest, the waves had been, by 'J-Bay' standards, mediocre. And there was a strong consensus among surfers that these conditions were not unconnected with the omission of the traditional African blessing of the beach. Hard-line evangelical Christians had banned it. 'It's pagan, you know,' explained Regan, an imposing white woman who was PR chief for the contest. </p> <p>Simphiwe and I went sandboarding together, sliding down the huge dunes of Aston Bay, whooping and falling about like 10-year-olds. He offered to take me around his township, in Hankey, 30 miles inland, while most of the other surfers went off in search of lions. That was when he introduced me to black magic and to his grandmother, Nowaningi, who lived in a cool, comfortable house made of mud and cow dung. She reassured me that a tikoloshe cannot get into your house if you throw salt around the door and the windows. </p> <p>While I was enjoying a wholesome lunch of millet ( umnqusho ) about 10 relatives dropped in to discuss a witch who had been exorcised and gone into exile in Port Elizabeth. They still didn't trust him. 'Once a witch, always a witch,' said Simphiwe. </p> <p>We walked along railway tracks, past orange and lemon and mango groves down in the Gamtoos valley, and clambered up a steep, rocky cliff into the caves where Simphiwe used to play as a child. On top of the heights that dominate Hankey, we gazed down in awe on the massive tripartite divide that is still the rule, if not the law, in South Africa: whites at one end of town, in smart houses with shops and schools and clinics; blacks at the other, in mud houses on unmade streets populated by goats; and coloureds in between, living in shacks. </p> <p>Simphiwe pointed out a few signs of progress. Now most houses have electricity and TV aerials. 'When television first came here, they said it was a white thing,' he explained. 'Blacks weren't allowed to own a TV. It was illegal.' The first time a black family acquired a television, everyone would crowd into the house to watch it at 10 cents a time. The first programme Simphiwe ever saw was William Tell, after which he made a crossbow out of sticks. </p> <p>But Simphiwe was proud that, amid all the changes and outside influences (his aunties' favourite singers were Mariah Carey and Celine Dion), the blacks had kept their traditions. He was desperate for his 'initiation'. In bygone days, adolescent boys would be taken into the wilderness for six months or so. Either they learnt lessons about survival and made it back independently, or they didn't. Now, because most of the community are hip urbanites, inexperienced at hunting and making a fire with sticks, the initiates are taken to a secluded spot a short way out of town. There they are cut off from women (and rivers, in case of mermaids) for a month and have to survive without salt or sugar or yeast, and suck their water out of a barrel of mud. And they must mount a vigil at night against witchcraft. But they are allowed regular supplies. Still, they do have to burn their clothes, live in improvised wigwams and - the scariest part - be circumcised with a spear (and without anaesthetic). </p> <p>Simphiwe took me to meet four old friends undergoing their initiation. They wore catapults at their hips and blankets as loin cloths and were smothered from head to toe in white clay, which had a symbolic value and was also useful for keeping the insects off. They were drowsy with lack of sleep, but glad to see Simphiwe and went slickly through some of their old karate routines together (one of them was a black belt, and Simphiwe could kick the branch of a tree higher than my head). </p> <p>But there was a lot of anxious talk of spears. Several recent circumcisions elsewhere had gone wrong and a number of deaths had occurred. There was a trend towards disposable spears, to avoid sharing. What with the slaughtered cow, the party, and the new clothes needed after graduation, the whole business was dangerous and cost up to \u00a3300. But Simphiwe wanted to go through with his initiation, otherwise he would be reviled and not be allowed to marry. </p> <p>He took me to the house of the local witch doctor, a large, mesmeric woman called Gloria, whose father had been an Anglican vicar. She preferred to be known as a 'traditional healer'. Gloria could cure various ailments, including impotence, with a cocktail of herbs and potions, and provide protection against spells. She gave me a small chunk of magic bark, which would enable me to utter 'words of power' and influence people. She told me my fortune, something Simphiwe shied away from, lest he learn the day of his death. </p> <p>When we got back to town, the evangelical Regan scrutinised me rigorously. 'You haven't been listening to all that mumbo-jumbo, have you?' she said. 'All you need to do is open your heart to God and go forth with peace and joy.' </p> <p>I never saw a tikoloshe while I was in Hankey. However, driving back to J-Bay at dusk, we did observe something black and whirling and dervish-like in the headlamps. When we pulled up and investigated, our hearts in our mouths, it turned out to be a bin bag spun about by the truck in front. </p> <p>On the other hand, Simphiwe and I did have one uncanny experience which he said was the strangest thing that had ever happened to him. After a chance encounter with an Afrikaner farmer's daughter, Agatha Schellingerhout, at the town library, she invited us back to the spacious farmhouse built by her father, Dirk, who showed me a PhD thesis (by Wendy Dilys Coetzee) about the origins of Hankey (founded by an early nineteenth-century missionary of that name who acquired most of the land from the Hottentots). Simphiwe had never been in a white farmhouse before. And they had never had a black kid to tea before either. Ten years ago, Simphiwe said, it would have been illegal. </p> <p>But the Schellingerhouts were kind and hospitable, and told rugged tales of survival in storm and flood, and only once showed any sign of racism. When Simphiwe asked for five sugars in his tea, Agatha turned to me and said, as if he wasn't there any more: 'They're all like that, you know.' </p> <p>As we were leaving, Dirk asked me if I believed in Jesus. 'He will come and make this place perfect,' he said. </p> <p>Driving back to Simphiwe's home in J-Bay, he told me one final mystery was playing on his mind - a 'very big question' that not even witch doctors had been able to answer for him. 'A witch can drive you mad or set you on fire, so how does it come about, when we have so much power, that the white man can come here and do what they did to South Africa?'</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>Simphiwe's Choice offers a guided tour around Hankey, a visit to his grandmother's house, local beer tasting and a grand overview of South African culture.

  "<p>As accident investigators pick over the events which led to last Tuesday's ferry disaster off the Greek island of Paros, travellers are asking which ferries to avoid and whether to steer clear of Greek ferries completely. </p> <p>The Independent Traveller's Greek Island Hopping 2000 guide described the ill-fated Express Samina as a 'grime bucket' and 'arguably the worst Greek ferry afloat', concluding that it is 'definitely a boat to be avoided'. </p> <p>But the author, dedicated island-hopper Frewin Poffley, is anxious to put last week's tragedy into context: 'The Express Samina was one of the few dinosaurs left and is not typical of boats you will find in the Greek fleet. Stan ards have improved in the last couple of years and newer ships are easily on a par with what you'd find crossing the Channel.' </p> <p>He also pointed out that a new ship with nobody at the bridge was just as likely to run into trouble as an old ship. </p> <p>Yet there are still a handful of ferries he would avoid, including the Samina's sister ship Express Naias, which sails from Piraeus to the Cyclades, and the Ialyssos which sails between Piraeus and the Dodecanese islands along the Turkish coast. </p> <p>Travellers can either buy a copy of the Greek Island Hopping Guide (\u00a312.99, Thomas Cook Publishing) or check out the website (<a href=\"http://www.greekislandhopping.com\">www.greekislandhopping.com</a>). Armed with this information it is possible to ask for a particular ferry when buying a ticket, assuming there is a choice. On bigger, more profitable routes there will be several boats operating. If in doubt, the catamarans and high-speed ferries offer a quicker (and more expensive) service and are all relatively young and purpose-built for this market. </p> <p>On routes to smaller and more remote islands, travellers may not have a choice. Poffley recommends trusting in gut instinct. 'If you are alarmed at the state of the boat then just walk away.' </p> <p>Poffley makes a point of checking out his nearest exit and lifeboat when travelling on overnight ferries: 'I ask myself how am I going to get out if I need to.' </p> <p>Originally the domain of backpackers, island-hopping has become an increasingly popular mainstream holiday option; between 1995 and 1999 numbers travelling on Greek ferries increased by over 10 million. </p> <p>According to the Annual Ferry Review produced by research company IRN Services, 50 million passenger trips are made on Greek ferries each year, and between 1994 and 1999 there were no fatalities - an impressive track record for a country which has the biggest ferry fleet in Europe. </p> <p>Most tour operators who feature islands not served by a direct flight will charter their own boat or hydrofoil to take holidaymakers to their destination. All boats are checked to ensure that they meet minimum safety requirements.</p>",

  "<p>It's often the simplest things that go wrong. Hong Kong director Wong Kar-Wei was convinced that his new film, provisionally called Summer in Beijing, was going to be a quick, relaxing experience following the logistical nightmare of his Buenos Aires-set gay love story, Happy Together, released in 1997. </p> <p>Sitting in London's, Soho House, dressed in his trademark blue shirt, blue jeans and shades, Hong Kong's most independently minded director is piecing together the story of how In The Mood For Love, became 'the most difficult film of my life'. </p> <p>The effort has clearly been worthwhile. Feted by critics from Cannes to Edinburgh, In The Mood For Love, starring Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung, further enhances his reputation as one of the most talented and distinctive filmmakers in world cinema. It is set to be his most successful film to date. </p> <p>It was originally going to be so straightforward. 'Right after Happy Together we wanted to start a film. Happy Together was a very difficult film because it was the first time we shot outside of Hong Kong - in Argentina, a place so far away, and we spoke no Spanish. After that I thought we should make a more simple film, not so expensive, with two actors: an actor and an actress I've worked with before, and we had good communications. And a very simple story. A film like that should be like a vacation. But somehow it's like the film has been cursed. </p> <p>'We wanted to make the film in Beijing, but we had problems with the censor's department in China. For some reason they didn't like the title. For us, Summer In Beijing seems to be a very romantic title, but for them, obviously it's not. And we wanted to shoot some of the scenes in Tiananmen Square, and we had to stop that. And so I thought maybe we would have to stop this project, and start something else. </p> <p>'So we started another story, a film in a restaurant called Beijing, and we could still have 'Summer In Beijing'. It's about food. But we came across the Asian financial crisis, and we had to find new investors. At this stage I thought we would have to give up: Maggie Cheung had other commitments. But we found other investors in Europe and started shooting the film. But because we all had commitments on other projects, we shot the film on and off, and it took 15 months.' </p> <p>But that wasn't the end of it. Wong Kar-Wei had made a commitment that the film was going to appear at Cannes this year. The print was meant to be ready the day they left Bangkok, where the film was shot. But it wasn't. The subtitles had to be hurriedly done in Paris en route to the festival. Nor was its successful Cannes debut the end of the trouble. </p> <p>'Right before I went to Edinburgh, we found some problems and I had to hand carry the film to the festival.' </p> <p>Not that you could tell any of this from watching the film. It is as economical and restrained as film making can be. 'I always tell people this film is like chamber music,' Kar-Wei says. </p> <p>There are a handful of sets, and very few actors. The film focuses entirely on the characters played by Leung and Cheung, who move into neighbouring flats in 1962 Hong Kong. Eventually they work out that their respective spouses (never shown) are having an affair. They start meeting for dinner, role-playing how the adulterers came together, and rehearsing confrontations. Eventually, this turns into some kind of a relationship, but how much of one is never made too clear. 'We had a love scene,' Kar-Wei says, 'but at the last moment I cut it. Because the whole thing happened in 1962, and people in that period were not explicit, and the story should not be explicit.' </p> <p>Indeed Kar-Wei never works with a full script. 'I was a writer before, and I hate writing. I think a script is just like a blueprint. Since most of the people have worked with us since my first film, we know each other very well.' His films evolve, right up to the point audiences finally see them. The character's lives can turn out to be very different from how they started. Cheung says she had little idea what the story was before she saw the film. </p> <p>'And he didn't know either,' she says 'If he told you differently, he's lying. I don't think an actor is ever comfortable with that. Even though I love the film, it's a shame... if only I had known that my part was like that from before I would have made it a bit more interesting, not necessarily to watch, but for myself to play. I would have had a better journey with the part. I think I missed out on the fun of acting, which was a shame. But it was built day by day.' </p> <p>It was all worth it though: In The Mood For Love is easily one of the films of the year, and coming after Happy Together, Fallen Angels and the wonderful Chungking Express, it confirms Kar-Wei's status. A few people thought the earlier films were too cool for their own good - too much hip Christopher Doyle camerawork showing good-looking people smoking a lot in neon-lit cities, and not much else. But In The Mood For Love makes it clear that what is left out is very deliberate. Ambiguity is the key, letting the audience work out what is going on. </p> <p>This film's chasteness, its loving recreation of the Shanghai immigrant community in early Sixties Hong Kong, is the very opposite of empty flash. 'It reminds me a lot of my personal experiences as a child,' Kar-Wei says. He was born in Shanghai, but the family moved to Hong Kong when he was five. He's now 42. </p> <p>He is a big man, with an aura of studied cool typified by the slightly ridiculous decision to wear sunglasses at all times. That doesn't quite work in the way it should, because you can still see his eyes behind the tint. </p> <p>The cool slips away when he talks about English football - not just the Premiership, but the trainspotting depths of the Nationwide league. The other part of his trademark look is the smoking. There are other recurrent tics in his films (Sixties pop, clocks) but the cigarettes you can't fail to notice. </p> <p>No one lights up for the first half-hour or so of In The Mood For Love, and its director says: 'I tried to smoke less during the shooting. But one day I thought I've had enough, I should let it go. I think it's something subconscious reflecting my situation during the production. Like we try to avoid the clock, but in the end, I thought, why?' </p> <p>In a Hong Kong film industry where stars often make 10 films a year, Kar-Wei stands out. He has had martial arts in his earlier movies, and gangsters, but most of his work, especially recently, has been small scale and love-lorn. Couple his outsider status with those unusual working habits, and it is no surprise that he uses the same crew and actors again and again. </p> <p>'For instance, in In The Mood For Love we had to spend 15 months together, and Maggie and Tony had other commitments, and you have to know the situation in Hong Kong. Often stars make two films at the same time, and in a very short period. So to work with us, we need someone who is very understanding. Maggie and Tony both input a lot in the film, and we have a lot of trust between us.' </p> <p>He has already finished two of the three segments of his next film, 2046. People have referred to it as his science-fiction film. 'It's more like a stage play. It happens in the future, but it's not so futuristic or not so science fiction, so don't expect something like The Matrix. </p> <p>The idea came from a promise the Chinese Government gave in 1997: they promised to leave Hong Kong 50 years unchanged. So 2046 is the last year of that promise, and I wanted to explore whether there will be anything unchanged.' </p> <p>How much has changed already? 'Not much. A lot of people in Hong Kong are afraid of change, but change is not a bad thing.' </p> <p>Kar-Wei's feelings about In The Mood For Love remain appropriately ambiguous. 'It was the most miserable period of my life, but my feeling about the film is that I didn't want to stop, I didn't want to let go. The reason we wanted to show the film in Cannes was so that we had a deadline. Otherwise, we could still be making it now.' </p> <p><strong>His leading lady: Maggie Cheung, the star of In The Mood For Love </strong></p> <p>There is something improbable about the combination of glamour and the far reaches of south London. Can Naomi Campbell really come from Streatham and Kate Moss from Croydon? Add another name to the list: Maggie Cheung, Hong Kong superstar and Wong Kar-Wei's favourite actress, was raised in West Wickham, south of Beckenham. Born in Hong Kong, she spent the vital ages of eight to 18 in suburban Kent. </p> <p>These days, the 36-year-old Cheung lives in Paris with her husband, director Olivier Assayas. But at 18, she went back to Hong Kong and became a model. That led to acting, and before long she was starring in up to 10 films a year, alongside the likes of Jackie Chan. 'I coped,' she says, 'because I was much younger.'</p> <p>Then in 1988 Wong Kar-Wei cast her in As Tears Go By. 'I would have a very different career if I had never met him... If I was still an actress, I would be doing parts that are a bit superficial, glamourous, empty parts. And his films are not like that, and because of his films, other directors who are a little more interesting want to work with me, give me a chance to play those difficult parts.'</p> <p>One of those parts, in Stanley Kwan's Actress, won her the best actress award at the Berlin Film Festival in 1992. Four years later, Assayas invited her to star in the culty Irma Vep. The two married soon after. She was lined up for a big part in Spielberg's Memoirs Of A Geisha, but that seems to be on hold again. Cheung doesn't seem too bothered.</p> <p>But she will always be there when Wong Kar-Wei calls, even if the process is a pain. 'I only enjoy it when we roll the camera. I hate the make-up, costumes. Hair and make-up on In The Mood For Love took four hours a day. That sucks!'</p> <p><strong>Wong's work: three of the best</strong></p> <p><strong>Chungking Express</strong><br> (1994)<br> Quentin Tarantino cried after watching this offbeat romance, which weaves together two tales about lonely cops who both find unlikely love. </p> <p><strong>Fallen Angels</strong><br> (1995)<br> A striking portrait of urban alienation, Fallen Angels focuses on a jaded hitman and his beautiful business partner. But the narrative takes second place to the dazzling visuals. </p> <p><strong>Happy Together</strong><br> (1997)<br> Kar-Wei won the Best Director prize at Cannes for this drama about the combustible relationship between a gay Hong Kong couple who relocate to Buenos Aires.</p> <p>\u0095 In The Mood For Love opens on 27 October</p>",
  "<p>There is only one question about Dr Mary Archer that hangs almost as heavily over her this weekend as do the criminal charges that were levelled against her husband last week, and it is this: why in God's name does she stay with him? Here is a woman who, through the study of her beloved chemistry, has dedicated her professional life to the pursuit of great scientific truths. And yet in her personal life she has dedicated herself to a man whose grasp upon truth is at best questionable. </p> <p>'I think she probably gets a lot out of the marriage,' says Michael Crick, Jeffrey Archer's biographer. 'She gets fame, fun and, until recently, she got social status.' A former acquaintance of the couple sees it simply as a diversion from what could otherwise have been an arid life amid the dull obsessions of academe: 'She likes his games and experiments, because it makes her life more interesting.' In this analysis Jeffrey Archer - millionaire novelist, former bankrupt, disgraced politician and, since 1992, Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare - is Mary Archer's bit of rough. He puts the colour in her otherwise dull life. In return, she plays the dutiful, supportive wife when the occasion calls for it. </p> <p>Clearly last week was not one of those occasions. She was absent when he arrived at Wimbledon police station to be charged with two counts of perjury, two of perverting the course of justice and one of using a false instrument. Nor was she to be seen that evening when, in one of the more bizarre twists in Lord Archer's narrative, he appeared on stage in Windsor in the first public performance of The Accused , his courtroom drama in which he plays an alleged murderer and upon whom, after hearing the evidence, the audience delivers a verdict. </p> <p>Doubtless, however, Mary will be at his side when he finally has to trudge to court - perhaps as early as Tuesday when he is due to appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court. For this is the pattern that their life together now traces: he gets into a scrape, attempts valiantly to tough it out, confesses all to Mary, who then lends her public support to the husband with whom she now spends relatively little time in private. </p> <p>There can be no more classic example than the most recent: that weekend last November after Archer's forced withdrawal from the London mayoral election, following the revelation that he had allegedly solicited a friend to provide a false alibi for him in his successful 1987 libel case against the Daily Star (out of which this week's charges arose). There were Mary and Jeff, photographed together in the Old Vicarage at Grantchester, exchanging loving looks, as he wrote letters of apology. 'I am cross,' she said, 'but I have formed the judgment that he is a decent and generous spirited man over 35 years and that will not change over one weekend.' She didn't care what others said - she was standing by her man. This weekend, she is said, by one close friend, to be 'very surprised, very downcast and very shocked' by the charges that Archer now faces. Well she might be. For if the charges against her husband are proven, it sullies the entirety of the 1987 libel trial, the very episode that invented her in the imagination of the British public. In one of the most priapic summations in the history of libel law, the late Mr Justice Caulfield turned to the jury and said of her, without a flicker of irony: 'Has she not grace? Has she not fragrance?' Sadly, for Mary at least, any sweet fragrance that surrounded that libel victory may now be turning into a rather nasty smell. </p> <p>Mary Archer was born Mary Doreen Weeden in December 1944, the daughter of Harold Weeden, a chartered accountant from Surrey. It was, by Mary's own testimony, 'a pretty average middle-class family'. She followed her sister to Cheltenham Ladies' College where she is recalled by a contemporary, Kate Trelford, as 'very clever and very quiet... a very cool customer'. She went to St Anne's College, Oxford, from where she graduated with a double first in chemistry, and where, as an undergraduate,she met Archer, four years her senior. </p> <p>They married in 1966 though she now says that at 22 she was 'much too young'. Why did she do it? 'Jeffrey seemed more mature, older than my contemporaries,' she said. 'So the partnership felt reasonably grown up.' After graduation, they moved to London where she studied at Imperial College and he pursued his political career, ending up as Conservative MP for Louth. </p> <p>In 1974 came the first Archer disaster when Aqua- blast, a company in which he had invested \u00a3250,000 of borrowed money, collapsed. It was nearly a week after the bankruptcy petition had been filed against him in the High Court before he told his wife. She was in the middle of a second birthday party for their son, William. 'I felt weak at the knees,' she later said, 'but there was nothing else to do except carry on with the party.' There has, it seems, never been anything else for Mary Archer to do but carry on with the party. </p> <p>Having resigned as an MP, Jeffrey set about writing them out of debt. 'Being in debt is worse than anything else,' Mary later said, 'and I've tried a few things.' (She has also said that great wealth is likewise a managerial trial.) She, meanwhile, supported the family by lecturing in chemistry at Trinity College, Cambridge, where she remained until 1986. By then, Jeffrey had hit the big time with his third novel, Kane and Abel . It is from this period that their increasingly separate lives are said to have developed, he spending week- days in London in his Thames-side penthouse before returning to Grantchester, where she had made her home, for weekends. </p> <p>There has been much speculation over how much Mary Archer knew of her husband's intimate relationship with his long-time assistant, Andrina 'Andy' Colquhoun, but she has always claimed to place marital fidelity low on the list of priorities. 'If you mean strict sexual fidelity,' she once said, 'it doesn't rank terribly high on my scale of the importance of things. In a quite objective sense, it can be tolerated more than indifference.' Whether she has applied that code to her own conduct is unclear, though she is said to have her own circle of friends. </p> <p>In 1987, any such questions had to be put to one side as, day after day, she accompanied her husband to court, while he fought his libel trial. The Star had accused him of consorting with prostitutes, notably Monica Coghlan, to whom he had given \u00a32,000. Mary emerged a public figure, f ted for her great - to some, completely unexpected - fashion sense and apparent grace under fire. Not that it seemed to affect her greatly. 'I feel nothing, nothing at all,' she said at the trial's end. 'When something cataclysmic happens I think you feel like that afterwards.' </p> <p>She now embarked on a new career in public life, becoming a trustee of the Science Museum and sitting on various energy advisory boards to the Department of Trade and Industry. She chaired the Hardship Committee at Lloyds of London, where she was already a Name, and joined the board of Anglia Television. Once more, Jeffrey upset the apple cart: in 1994, without telling his wife, he bought shares in Anglia just before a take-over bid for the company. There were allegations (never proven) of insider dealing. Mary confessed to being 'embarrassed' by the affair. </p> <p>Indeed, she seems to have created a uniquely restrained language to describe the behaviour of her husband and its impact upon her. She has talked about his 'gift for inaccurate pr\u00e9cis'. She has dismissed his scandals as his 'little bombshells'. After last November's revelation, she simply announced: 'We are all human but Jeffrey manages to be more human than most.' </p> <p>This cool, almost detached approach to his dramas tallies with the recollections of those who dealt with her when she was chairing the Lloyds Hardship Committee. 'She was quite extraordinary, like a machine,' says Fernada Herford, who represented one of the largest groups of Names. 'There were these people who had been completely devastated and she sailed through without a whisker of compassion. She is a tough and heart less lady.' Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyds Names Association Working Party at the time, agrees. 'I never warmed to her,' he says. 'I always thought ice-maiden was a more appropriate term than fragrant.' To those who know her well, however, Mary Archer is not so much cold as analytical, particularly where her husband is concerned. 'Mary Archer has had 30 years to acquire a very decent perspective on her husband,' says a friend. 'She's not still there through inertia but through a lively appreciation of his qualities, which are immense, and an enlarged sense that he's taken her on an adventure through life that she would otherwise not have had.' But if we want a real understanding of Mary Archer, we might best be served by going back to that libel trial. During her evidence, she was asked what she recalled of her husband's conversation with Adam Raphael, then political editor of The Observer . Raphael said that Archer told him he had met Coghlan months before he paid her the money. In court, Archer denied he said such a thing and Mary Archer backed him up. </p> <p>Before she did so, however, she told her husband's barrister: 'I would like to say that, although it is my very genuine recollection that this was the conversation with Mr Raphael I cannot say that that recollection is not overlaid by the wish that it was so.' The implication is extraordinary: that Mary Archer, the ice-cool scientist, famed for her acute intellect, is powered through her curiously detached marriage by the very same thing that has powered her husband throughout his adult life - wishful thinking. That may well came in handy as together they face Lord Archer's latest adventure in court. </p> <p><strong> MARY DOREEN ARCHER</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> DoB :</strong> 22 December 1944 </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> Cheltenham Ladies' College; St Anne's, Oxford; Imperial College, London </p> <p><strong> Status: </strong> Married to Lord Archer of Weston-super-Mare (AKA Jeffrey Archer) </p> <p> <strong> Interests: </strong> Reading, writing, singing </p> <p><strong> Home: </strong> Grantchester, Cambridge </p> <p><strong> Quote :</strong> 'We are all human, but Jeffrey manages to be more human than most'</p>",
  "<p>It's the first of October and here we are at the end of something, facing the empty quarter of the year, speeding along, barely noticing the passing of time, getting older and more infantile along the way, and the world is turning brown. One of the worst changes over the past 25 years is that it is rare for a stubble field to be left for more than a few weeks, and normal for it to be cultivated within days of harvest. </p> <p>OK, so the townies among you don't notice or care about these things, but if your personal landscape is defined by fields rather than streets, this changes everything. The great autumnal tapestry of faded ochre and green is now lost. Stubble fields were places where you could walk without damaging anything, and for a few months the countryside was opened up to arable land in a way that it never is now. It is all part of the way farmers are alienating the rest of us from the landscape. In the process, autumn has turned from a tawny, golden place to a uniformly brown one. </p> <p>Why this outburst of bile? It's mainly because I think brown is a deadly colour in the garden. It must be used very carefully indeed, if it is not to weigh down too heavily on the eye and spirits. Copper and bronze, on the other hand, add richness and depth. The trick is not to confuse either with brown. For the last month, the best example of this distinction has been with fabulous sunflowers 'Velvet Queen' and 'Prado Red'. The yellow shining through the brown tint, with orange pollen in the central discs and the burgundy colour of the stems gives the 'brown' a burnished-coppery tint that electrifies the colour. The flowers dominate the September garden. Helenium 'Moerheim Beauty' doesn't overwhelm in anything like the same way but is just as powerfully, if more modestly, effective. It has become so acclaimed and ubiquitous that it is almost a horticultural clich\u00e9, but then you could say the same of carrots or grass. </p> <p>We also have H 'Red and Gold', which is less well known but works equally well at creating the dispersed russet burnish. Rudbeckia hirta is grown as an annual (although it is actually biennial or even perennial in the right conditions) and 'Gloriosa Daisy Mix' has rich, orangey-copper tones, as does 'Rustic Dwarfs', although this might include the odd truly yellow flower which, in a fit of puritanical zeal to retain metallic status, can be smartly snipped off. </p> <p>Again and again, as you look closely at flowers, you see that it is the combination of colours that makes colour effects, and pure hue is actually very rare. The Crocosmia 'Dusky Maiden' has exactly this mix of orange, russet and green with a patina of purple that all adds up to a rich bronze. We only planted it this spring and it is already an important element in the Jewel garden. </p> <p> Lysimachia ciliata 'Firecracker' is another plant that works very well in this colour range, although in a very different way. It takes up quite a lot of space but develops from a chocolaty purple in high summer, dotted with small gold flowers, to a much bronzer cast by late summer. It is never a star in the way sunflowers or heleniums are, but it is a particularly trouble-free plant and adds a permanently rich colour dimension to a border throughout a long season. Another plant with the same shade of leaf is Rodgersia pinnata 'Superba', while the plantain Plantago major 'Rubrifolia' is as bronze as the Lysimachia and Rodgersia . </p> <p>We have a few clumps of Echinacea purpurea in the Jewel garden which, at first, seems an unlikely contender, given that the mauvey-pink petals are wildly outside the thematic parameters of strong jewel colours. But the petals tend to hang down giving the cones prominence, and the combination of the rose/purple and the russety orange cones makes a distinctly coppery mix. More striking is the combination or the seed heads and stems of the orache Atriplex hortensis var. rubra. Each 10ft plant has thousands of seeds that spread at the tiniest rustle. In September, they turn a Naples yellow and the stems remain burgundy purple, and that combination again makes a coppery bronze. I was clearing a patch yesterday that had fallen down, and ended up with seeds in all sorts of interesting places. </p> <p>We have trouble getting bronze fennel to overwinter with anything like the same enthusiasm as its green cousin, so sow lots of it each year to replace the inevitable losses. It is worth the trouble because the unfolding plumes of foliage are a superb bronze in spring and early summer. </p> <p>Although there are very few true bronze or copper flowers, one of the best exceptions to this rule is the iris - many of which are suffused with copper and bronze, although none will be in flower now. Nevertheless, Iris 'Autumn leaves', I 'Adobe Sunset', I 'Brindisi', I 'Gingerbread Man' and I 'Blue-eyed Brunette' are all really strong metallic additions to the border. </p> <p>Our tree peonies, Paeonia delavayi, a rusty bronze, are modest to the point of retiring, but I adore them and look forward to their appearance every May with real eagerness. They are a private, intimate pleasure, as are all the best of flowers. At about the same time, the Euphorbia griffithii 'Dixter' picks up the same tone of rusty copper, but with more flamboyance. </p> <p>But the whole garden is flushed with intense, new green when the irises, peonies and euphorbias are out. That is last season's history and the reality of the garden now is that it is dying quietly on the vine. Of all the grasses, Miscanthus sinensis 'Malepartus' is relishing the hour as gloriously as anything. As the plumes open, they gather in an extraordinary concertina of zigzags before becoming bronzed, plum-feathered pennants. We planted our first one three years ago now and it has established as a really strong clump that will last well into autumn. </p> <p>If you think that it is stretching things too far to call M 'Malepartus' bronze, there can be no argument with M Nepalensis, which is always described as gold but is actually more a brassy colour and is ravishingly beautiful. The best-known bronze grass is Carex comans 'Bronze Form', which is certainly worth a place for its structure as well as the colour, and tolerates quite deep shade. We grow a couple at the base of the aforementioned tree peonies, and the relationship is flourishing. Carex buchananii, which is similar but has charming wiggly bits to the ends of its leaves, is a good and useful component of the metallic kit, as is Carex flagellifera, with a more ginger tint to it than C comans, which it resembles. </p> <p>Finally, the most important bronze and copper influence in our Jewel garden only starts to come into effect in a week or two's time, which is the turning of the hornbeam hedge that surrounds it. Like beech, hornbeam keeps its leaves for most of the winter, turning a lovely russety colour that dominates the garden and restores my faith in brown as a colour to be lived with. If I am honest, I did not fully weigh the importance of this when I planned the garden, but it has a huge influence on the garden for half the year.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden </strong></p> <p>It is apple season in this the appliest of all British counties and I have spent a lot of time in the past week identifying the apples in our orchard. If I had kept a proper record of what was planted where when I did it, I would not have had to do this. But I didn't. </p> <p>Of course, when you are planting anything, you think you'll remember - but you never do. It is one of the first rules of gardening: label everything clearly when you plant or sow it. We have 41 apple trees in the orchard, with two of five varieties (William Crump, Blenheim Orange, Worcester Pearmain, Herefordshire Beefing and Bramley's Seedling). That makes 36 different varieties, of which about a dozen are quite rare and very specific to this area. I had properly labelled about a dozen, about a dozen were unlabelled and - worst of all - a dozen were inaccurately labelled. So, effectively, I had to identify two dozen varieties.</p> <p>Luckily, the trainspotter in me comes willingly forward when it comes to apples. I love the fruit and the trees equally and really enjoyed the detective work involved on the internet, in the library and going through my own records.</p> <p>Funnily enough, I have a vivid memory of writing the garden diary a couple of years ago having planted six apple trees. I was dog-tired, and knew I was putting the wrong varieties down. I didn't bother to check them - which would have meant taking a torch and going up to the orchard in the rain - promising myself that I'd do so in the morning - but I never did.</p> <p>The job is not entirely done. I have yet to identify 'Dr Hare's' and 'Devonshire Buckland' - the only record of which I can find on a French pomona on the internet, with no description. If anyone can enlighten or help me either via this newspaper or directly to montydon@btclick I should be very grateful.</p> <p>The trees are very young but we are still getting dozens and dozens of apples. Knowing where and how to store them is a problem. A dedicated apple store seems to me a lovely thing and I am tempted to build one. It need not be much bigger than the chicken shed, and as long as it was frost-free and dry, could be very simple. It would be a kind of grown-up wendy house, dressed in the solemnity of a purpose. I can smell it now, that slightly musty, cidery tang that stored apples with crinkly skins give off, each variety in its own rack or shelf, all labelled but slightly scruffy. Bit like the orchard itself.</p> <p><strong>Your roots: Tasks to complete before the frost sets in </strong></p> <p>October is an important month in the garden because almost anything can be planted or moved without harm. Although conventionally a little early, I find it a particularly good time for planting deciduous hedges and trees. </p> <p>Raise the blades of the lawnmower and, even if the weather is good, resist the temptation to cut your grass too low. Grass continues to grow if the weather doesn't drop below 5 C, but must be allowed to get longer over winter to protect roots.</p> <p>Watch out for ground frosts. An overnight layer of horticultural fleece over vegetables, flowers or even small trees is usually enough to stop any damage at this time of year.</p> <p>If you have any ground to dig or clear, do it now. Mix plenty of manure or compost in as you dig and leave dug soil in large clods; the weather will break it down into a fine tilth by next spring.</p>",
  "<p>Mandy Evans last saw her son alive on 12 January 1995, just after 7am. They were in the Bristol Royal Infirmary, and 16-month-old Joshua, already asleep from his pre-med, was being prepared for 'arterial switch' cardiac surgery. Put at its most basic, the major arteries in Joshua's heart were positioned incorrectly, and would have to be 'switched' around. The surgeon assigned to carry out the intricate operation was Janardan Dhasmana. </p> <p>Unbeknown to Mandy, and her partner and Joshua's father, Bert Loveday, Dhasmana's survival rate for these operations was well below the national average. So far below that, on the evening before Joshua's operation, a secret eleventh-hour crisis meeting was held at the hospital. </p> <p>It was decided that the operation would go ahead. By the following afternoon, Joshua was dead. His case sparked public uproar and served as a catalyst for a far-reaching inquiry into the deaths and brain damage of scores of children who'd passed through Bristol, stretching as far back as 1984. In 1997, James Wisheart, the department head, was struck off the register by the General Medical Council. Dhasmana was suspended from operating upon children for three years. </p> <p>Even though she had given evidence to the GMC, Mandy gleaned cold comfort from these reprisals - her child was still dead. Before long, her partner was also dead. Haunted by his son's death, Bert Loveday became progressively more depressed and disoriented. Before, the biggest trouble Bert ever got into was over parking offences. After, he participated in an armed robbery. He gave himself up, and got three years, hanging himself in his cell a little over a month into his sentence. He was one of four 'Bristol parents' to commit suicide. </p> <p>On that January morning, waiting with Bert and their other son, Luke, then two, for Joshua to go into theatre, Mandy wasn't aware of either the drama of the previous evening's meeting or the tragedy and recriminations to come. She just had this 'gut feeling'. When the surgical staff tried to wheel Joshua away, she clung on to the trolley and, weeping hysterically, refused to let go. Mandy says now: 'I wanted to pick Josh up, asleep or not, and take him home. I couldn't let go of the bed, they had to pull me away.' </p> <p>As they finally led her son away, Mandy remembers being transfixed by the expression on the face of one of hospital staff. 'It wasn't blank, it was like fear. If I read it now, he was saying to me, \"What are you doing? Take him away.\" </p> <p>'But he didn't actually say anything. Nobody said anything. It was all just looks without words. If the words had come, just one word, just one note, we'd have picked up Joshua, and we'd have been gone.' </p> <p>Talking in a London hotel room, Mandy occasionally breaks down during the telling of her story, bowing her head, until her hair forms a shield around her face. However, for the most part, she is composed and eloquent, blessed - or cursed, depending on your view - with total recall. It is harrowing to listen to her account of that long, dreadful day which would have such tragic repercussions for her family. As Joshua had been doing so well, the Lovedays were surprised when Bristol brought forward his switch operation, but they had faith in Dhasmana. </p> <p>'He seemed very confident and capable,' says Mandy. 'We needed to trust him. He had control over our son's life, over all our lives. He was a God figure.' </p> <p>Late on the night before the operation, the Lovedays saw Dhasmana. He'd come straight from the fateful meeting, but no mention was made of that. He apologised for being late, saying he'd been 'on his rounds', and asked them to sign the consent form. Unlike some of the other parents involved in the Bristol case, the Lovedays did ask questions. </p> <p>'Bert was good like that,' says Mandy. 'He didn't say a lot, but if he had anything to say, he said it straight. That night, Bert asked Dhasmana the same question he always had, \"Can you do it?\" </p> <p>In so many words, Dhasmana said that it wasn't a simple operation, but he'd done enough of them to know what he was doing.' Bert signed. </p> <p>When the nurse came to tell the Lovedays that Joshua had died, Mandy can only remember crying 'Oh my God!' continuously. Dhasmana arrived, still in his greens, with tears in his eyes. Mandy couldn't bear to look at him: 'I knew what he'd just been doing,' she says. 'My son's blood was still on him.' Loveday shook Dhasmana's hand, and said: 'It's all right, mate, you did your best.' Mandy said Bert never mentioned that again afterwards. 'He could never talk about how he'd said thanks.' </p> <p>Dhasmana might have done 'his' best but, although it appears that certain children who died at Bristol would probably have died anywhere, in a more able surgeon's hands Joshua's was a far from hopeless case. Mandy is haunted by the fact that their son could have survived, tortured by all the 'if onlys'. </p> <p>'What finished Bert off was the fact that he signed that consent form. For me, it's having the gut feeling that I should take Josh and run, but not doing it.' </p> <p>However, it was only when she was alerted by a television documentary researcher investigating the Bristol scandal that the jigsaw started to fall into place. The 'looks' from staff. The junior nurse sobbing in the corridor. The fob-offs. The inquest that never happened. The way, the day Joshua died, the hospital briefly gave them his body wrapped up in blankets in a Moses basket. 'At the time I didn't know that the operation had taken so long, his chest cavity was still open.' Mandy feels that Joshua's operation went ahead despite serious misgivings because: 'The hospital wanted to prove they could do it.' </p> <p>She saw Dhasmana at the GMC hearing: 'He was within touching distance. I wanted to hit him. He was so pompous and arrogant. When I gave evidence, he kept shaking his head as if to say, \"Nonsense, nonsense.\" ' </p> <p>She is slightly dismissive of Steve Bolsin, the Bristol anaesthetist who finally blew the whistle. 'If I met him, I'd shake his hand, but there's a part of me that thinks he's just as bad as the rest. They all knew what was going on, but nobody said anything. A note, just one note, is all it would have took.' </p> <p>These days, Mandy is coping as best she can. At times, the memories make her physically ill. When she was getting ready to go out recently, her other son, Luke, asked who would look after him if she didn't come back, if she died. As Joshua was one of the children whose heart Bristol retained, she also has to deal with that. </p> <p>'All I want is peace of mind,' says Mandy wearily, the coffee beside her sitting cold and untouched in its cup. 'But I can never have that without Bert and Josh. All I've got is Luke - we keep each other going.'</p>",
  "Militant farmers and road hauliers plan a massive escalation in the battle over fuel prices - blacking out power supplies, halting food distribution to supermarkets and blockading railway lines. <p>Fuel protest leaders have given the Government until 13 November to cut petrol and diesel taxes or they say they will renew action that caused disruption last month. </p> <p>An Observer investigation has established that protesters may launch a co-ordinated attack on the national grid. Farmers and their sympathisers intend to strain the power network by causing short periods of high demand. </p> <p>A leading militant farmer revealed that the protesters intend to synchronise their watches one Monday morning this or next month, using the 7am broadcast of the BBC news. At 9am, they will turn off the electricity mains in their buildings and then, with the power off, turn every appliance on. At 9.15am they will switch their mains supply on again for 30 seconds. </p> <p>'We'll switch our mains on for three 30-second periods, sending a power surge through the national grid,' said a senior militant farmer. 'We've been discussing it for 12 months. By that time of day, farmers will have done their milking and kids will be in school. Hospitals have their own generators these days, so they won't be inconvenienced,' he said. 'It's so simple. Farmers and allied industries could stop the country dead without leaving their homes.' </p> <p>A national grid spokesman responded: 'We can never guarantee supply at every occasion, but we are well used to dealing with sudden increases in demand.' </p> <p>Another target will be food supplies. Rhys Parry, the influential South Wales organiser for the Farmers For Action group, said distribution centres for leading supermarket chains could be targeted by blockades similar to the ones which froze the fuel distribution network. Less than 100 such depots supply food nationwide to Safeway, Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Somerfield and Kwik Save. Parry estimated that many supermarket shelves could be cleared within two days, as most stores have only a day or two of stock on site and blockades could trigger panic buying of food by the public. </p> <p>Though such a widespread protest would require much larger organisation than the fuel blockades, Parry believes the scheme could work. 'We would not want to trigger a food shortage, but we could hit the supermarkets on a national level,' he said. </p> <p>Other options include a rail blockade. Protesters would form human chains across lines, forcing national rail cancellations and causing widespread disruption. 'If you just put some bodies on the track and ring ahead to tell the railways what you are doing, you can easily stop the trains,' said one farmer in North Wales who was a key figure in triggering the fuel protests. </p> <p>One senior activist from the road haulier protesters said: 'We could take a holiday for three days - and simply not drive our lorries. They can't force us to.' </p> <p>Fuel refineries and depots will still be at the core of the protests. The Government, oil firms and some transport firms have agreed to make delivery of fuel a vital service, but any new legislation to guarantee supplies, in the same way as water and electricity, is unlikely to be in place before the 60-day deadline expires. 'Fuel is certainly still the most vulnerable target,' said Professor Paul Wilkinson, a terrorism and direct action specialist at the University of St Andrews. </p> <p>Tanker drivers might still be reluctant to cross unofficial pickets manned by their colleagues in the haulage business, and the fact that fuel is moved by road makes tanker deliveries leaving the depots at risk from go-slows. </p> <p>The plans could cause bitter confrontation with the police. 'Quite a small number of people with some bright ideas can do an awful lot of disruption,' Wilkinson said. </p> <p>The disclosures come after a week in which the Government has refused to soften its position on fuel tax. Chancellor Gordon Brown still has the option of scheduling cuts to fuel tax in his pre-budget speech and appeasing protes tors before the deadline passes. In his Brighton conference speech, Brown gave few signs he would grant any concessions. The speech outraged fuel protesters. 'He and Tony Blair totally missed the point. If they don't do something about the fuel tax, it is going to be a very hard winter for them,' said Clive Swan, a farmer near Mold in North Wales. </p> <p>Relying on their vast network of mobile phones and personal contacts, they aim to strike quickly and effectively across the country if no concessions are made. 'I can have 500 farmers out in two hours,' said Swan. 'We come from nowhere, do what's got to be done, and then disappear. We make a virtue out of our lack of structure,' Swan said. </p> <p>The protesters intend to discuss these proposals at a series of informal meetings over the next month, in the North Wales hills where the September protests began. </p> <p>The Transport Minister, Lord Macdonald, said yesterday that the Army may be used to drive petrol tankers in any future crisis, and government sources stressed that steps are being taken to improve intelligence on the protesters' activities and ensure better communication between different police forces. </p> <p>The police will also try to crack down swiftly on anyone blocking roads and abandon the 'softly-softly' approach they adopted last time. </p> <p>At blockades of refineries the police will offer to escort tankers through the picket lines as soon as the protesters arrive.</p>",
  "<p>At 30 he was a depressed and penniless unemployed former community relations worker trying to cope with a failing marriage. Nothing, it seemed, had worked out for Greg Dyke. </p> <p>He sat on Wandsworth Common, near his dingy flat in the unlovely streets of inner-city London, contemplating his latest personal disaster - defeat as a Labour candidate in the 1977 GLC election. His hopes of a career in politics lay in ruins. Dyke, bright, self-confident but never academically accomplished, had been the apple of his parents' eye - 'I was the one who was always meant to do well.' Head in hands, he wondered out loud: 'Whatever happened to me?' </p> <p>Dyke's rise to director-general of the BBC - the heart of the British establishment - is a tale for our times. The underachieving grammar school boy with strictly limited horizons, who stumbled into ITV late in life as the most junior of assistant programme-makers, climbed television's corporate ladder with astonishing speed by playing up his working-class roots. He then bagged around \u00a310 million from a series of golden handcuffs, share options and company takeover payouts, and ended up, as DG, at the very centre of the establishment he once so loudly denounced. </p> <p>Just a few years ago Dyke himself would not have believed it. 'Saddam Hussein's got more chance of running the BBC than me,' he once told an interviewer. 'I'm just not a BBC person.' For him, being a 'BBC person' meant Oxbridge, time-serving, a cultivated accent and, at the highest level in the corporation, all the right establishment attitudes and contacts. It meant being part of 'an intellectual elite' which Dyke himself once said had 'captured the TV production process' and was out of tune with the mass TV-watching audience. </p> <p>His appointment caused horror among tradition-alists who see the man best known for ditching News at Ten and bringing Roland Rat, Gladiators and Channel Five to the screen as the ultimate ratings chaser, a man with little interest in the BBC's role as guardian of Britain's cultural heritage. </p> <p>The man himself puts the opposition down to 'sheer snobbery' on the part of people who do not realise how the country has changed. The press campaign aimed at blocking Dyke was led by the Times; Rupert Murdoch once reportedly described Dyke to executives at Sky TV as 'our enemy'. The irony is that Dyke could easily have ended up working for Murdoch. </p> <p>After leaving school in 1965 with one A-level, Dyke stumbled into a job as a local newspaper reporter as an alternative to getting a 'proper job'. He worked at the same newspaper group as Raymond Snoddy, now a journalist on the Times . 'In those days I was the steady, serious broadsheet reporter and Greg was the populist tabloid man,' Snoddy says, adding: 'And nothing's changed.' </p> <p>Dyke took to tabloid journalism like a natural. Easily bored, he could enliven the most tedious local paper fare with a flash irreverence or a scathing putdown of some pompous local worthy. He was the life and soul of the office, joining in Thursday-night poker schools, when junior reporters would gamble their wages in the pub. </p> <p>He earned extra money by selling stories, complete with the required tabloid spin, to national newspapers. Many at the time thought he would make the logical next move on to a national newspaper; Murdoch's Sun, launched just a few years earlier and then still committed to the political Left, would have been perfect for him. Few doubt that he had the ability to become a national tabloid editor. </p> <p>But by the late Sixties Dyke had become political. He had nurtured a sense of social injustice ever since being subjected to the 11-plus exam, a searing experience for many of his generation. In his hedonistic twenties he had shared the vague American-inspired radicalism of the Bob Dylan and Woodstock generation. Dyke always was (and remains) a fan of American popular culture and, especially, the egalitarian 'can do' Californian outlook on life. </p> <p>The issue that gave his politics a harder edge was race. Covering the politics beat for the Slough Evening Mail led to a close friendship with the pioneering racial equality campaigner Joan Lestor, the local MP. Slough, together with the suburbs of Hayes and Southall where Dyke had grown up, had become major centres for Asian immigration. It was Dyke's job to report on the resulting racial tensions. He was appalled by the racialism of parts of the Tory party and by the way newspaper journalists often gave a circulation-boosting racial slant to stories. </p> <p>In 1971, deeply committed to Labour's left wing, Dyke decided that newspaper journalism was too 'glib' and went to York University to take stock and study politics (by now he had his trade-mark beard and long hair; his specialist subject was Che Guevara and the Cuban revolution). </p> <p>At university he met and married his first wife, Christine Taylor. She was generally regarded as the most beautiful woman at the college and, since Dyke could never claim to be an oil painting himself, the couple were known to some as 'Beauty and the Beast'. The childless marriage was to span the Seventies, for the most part an aimless and unhappy decade for Dyke. After graduating, he followed Christine to Newcastle, where he was turned down for a job as a reporter on a local BBC radio station and had to seek work on the sort of local newspapers he thought he had left behind. </p> <p>It was then Dyke made the decision to move back to London with Christine and take a job as 'campaigns officer' at Wandsworth Community Relations Council, a group promoting good race relations, in South London. </p> <p>He hated the job and jacked it in to concentrate on a campaign to be elected GLC councillor for Putney, a post that carried a good salary and the prospect of later becoming an MP. The election, in the then safeish but rapidly gentrifying constituency, ended in disaster and Dyke's stroll on Wandsworth Common. </p> <p>Things looked bleak until Nick Evans, a fellow reporter from Newcastle who had taken a job as a TV journalist at London Weekend Television, steered him into a junior job working on LWT's local politics programme. This was to be his big break and, significantly, it came through the network of friends in the media he had started to accumulate. </p> <p>LWT was really buzzing. It was the ITV station responsible, under Michael Grade, for the glitz and glamour of the Saturday-night showbiz schedule and, at the same time, the very heart of lavishly funded trendy and 'youth' television - home of Melvyn Bragg's South Bank show, the Minority Programmes Unit (which produced the first programmes for black people, lesbians, gays and other minorities) and many of the people who were to be leading lights in Channel Four. Dyke worked in the more sedate and intellectual current affairs department, where the austere style was set by eggheads such as John Birt and Peter Jay, with their 'Mission to Explain'. </p> <p>By now age was starting to count heavily against Dyke. Entry into TV journalism after the age of 30 was almost unheard of, and he knew that he had to prove himself quickly if he was to make any sort of career in TV. He made an immediate impact, working round the clock, playing up his tabloid background as the rough-tough, streetwise 'man of the people' who could cut through all the intellectual bullshit to give LWT's politics programmes a sharper, populist edge. </p> <p>He was rewarded with the risky but important job of launching an early-evening popular current affairs programme - vital to LWT's ratings and profits. The result was The Six O'Clock Show fronted by Michael Aspel and Janet Street-Porter, reckoned by many to be the first (and much copied) example of British tabloid TV. The show - tame by today's standards - consisted mainly of silly stunts dreamed up by Dyke and his growing coterie of mates. </p> <p>It also launched the mainstream TV careers of Danny Baker, in many ways a sort of on-screen version of Dyke himself, and Charlie Parsons, creator of The Big Breakfast Planet 24 empire. Behind the scenes the producers and technical people Dyke used on The Six O'Clock Show formed a tightly knit group who went on to dominate much of trendy, populist TV production in the UK. The success of The Six O'Clock Show led to an even greater challenge - to rescue ailing breakfast TV station TV-am. </p> <p>The station had been launched with all sorts of fancy and intellectual programme ideas; these had impressed the TV regulators but had been met with mass boredom from the breakfast audience. Dyke turned the station upside-down, brought in a new schedule based round Roland Rat, bingo, celebrity gossip, horoscopes, Diana Dors and her diet (producing one of Dyke's favourite TV moments, the sight of several stones of raw lard, representing what she had supposedly lost thanks to TV-am's advice) and endless talk about the weather, sunshine and holiday plans. </p> <p>It was another massive hit, elevating Dyke from being a mere programme-maker to becoming a chauffeur-driven TV executive and one of the most sought-after people in the television business. </p> <p>He was soon on the move again, this time taking charge of TVS (now Meridian), the ITV company for the South of England. Dyke was now living in a big house in rural Hampshire with Sue Howes, a a sociology teacher. He was starting to become a wealthy man. </p> <p>He and Sue would say that they didn't really like living in posh Hampshire and missed the graffiti and noise of the inner city. </p> <p>It seemed the more powerful and wealthy Dyke became, the more he played up his working-class roots and dislike of high culture - carefully crafting an image as a 'man of the people' who knew what the masses wanted. Once, finding himself at the Glyndebourne Opera Festival on TVS business, Dyke turned to Sue and said: 'You know what - we've become the sort of people we used to want to throw bombs at.' </p> <p>From TVS, Dyke moved back to LWT, where he took over as Director of Programmes and then Managing Director, becoming one of the most powerful men in British television and, apparently, destined one day to run ITV. </p> <p>It was as managing director that Dyke met Christopher (later Sir Christopher) Bland, the LWT chairman and now BBC chairman, which is the key to the future of the BBC. Bland was an Oxbridge, ex-army, high Tory politician and City financier, who married into the aristocracy. </p> <p>On the face of it he and Dyke were chalk and cheese. But together they reckoned they covered the whole waterfront. Bland had the contacts in the City and in the bowels of the Tory establishment; Dyke was close to the emerging New Labour hierarchy, had the instincts of the mass TV audience in his blood, and knew how to make popular television. </p> <p>Together they set about making LWT the most aggressively commercial and profitable company in British TV. Dyke stripped out whole layers of management, oversaw massive job cuts and prepared to run the station single-handed in the event of a strike. He won so much trust from the colleagues he was sacking, and carried out the downsizing exercise with such skill and generosity in terms of redundancy packages, that he emerged, if anything, more popular than before. </p> <p>When Bland and Dyke won back LWT's licence to broadcast in the 1993 franchise auction the two men roared round the building to the strains of the Theme From Rocky in the manner of a football manager and his captain doing a lap of honour at Wembley. </p> <p>Dyke and Bland's new lean and mean LWT was the toast of the City. LWT shares soared, resulting in Dyke eventually reaping around \u00a36 million from a golden handcuffs share option scheme devised by Bland. </p> <p>The plan was to use LWT's growing financial muscle to buy out the other ITV franchises (such as Granada and Central) and thus dominate the whole of ITV. </p> <p>Instead LWT, the hunter, became the prey. The company was bought up by Granada in one of the most bitterly contested takeover battles of the Nineties. Dyke and Bland earned still more millions once Granada took over. But the personal cost was devastation. </p> <p>LWT, Dyke's pride and joy, had ceased to exist. It was a complete debacle, one of the darkest days of his life. Dyke hit out at the City institutions which had brought about LWT's demise, calling them 'parasites' and denouncing the whole set-up as 'the last vestige of the old class system'. </p> <p>A disgusted Dyke announced that he was leaving TV. What led to his successful change of course was the arrival of Bland as BBC chairman and, crucially, the election of the New Labour government. </p> <p>Dyke had never made any bones about his political commitment and, with time on his hands after leaving LWT, he was even offered a peerage. Dyke's response was withering: 'Me? Lord Dyke of Hayes - can you imagine it? It sounds like a bloody gay girls' pop group!' </p> <p>Now, with a generally pro-BBC Labour government in power, Dyke finds himself in a much more powerful position than any director-general since Lord Reith. </p> <p>Dyke once described his share option millions as 'f*** off money', meaning that he need never again put up with a decision he disagreed with just to keep his job. At one point, he even offered to forgo the DG's \u00a3400,000 salary. More importantly, Bland will keep the governors - the people ultimately in charge of the corporation and bane of many a previous DG's life - off his back. </p> <p>The Dyke internal revolution has already begun. The abolition of perks such as free cars for managers and long expense-account lunches has grabbed the headlines.

  "Richard Dawkins's writing is usually a safeguard against sloppy thinking, but his article on GM research (Comment, last week) misses the point. <p>The work of Roentgen and Muller was contained within laboratories. Controlled experiments using genetically modified plants are not contained. Common sense suggests that the flight range of pollinating insects and the spread of pollen in the wind make it likely that modified genes, good or bad, will be replicated in the seeds of plants outside the experimental area. Once the genes are in the general environment they cannot be retrieved. </p> <p>If he can assure me, scientifically, that the modified genes are contained and cannot be reproduced outside the experimental area, he has won my support. If he cannot, my cheque to Greenpeace will be in the post!<br><b>Rev Chris Gardner<br>Worthing </b><br></p> <p>Dawkins is as eloquent as ever in setting out the need for controlled experiment before we decide that GM crops would be a Good Thing or a Bad Thing. I can accept all that, as I can accept his argument against popular direct action on this and other matters. But have I missed something? </p> <p>Let's assume that in fact GM crops turn out to be a Bad Thing, even a disaster. The experiments have taken place in open fields, not too far from unmodified crops. The birds, the bees and the breeze are no respecters of lines drawn on a map. Cross-pollination takes place. </p> <p>Can Professor Dawkins explain, in his persuasive way, how we then get the genie back into the bottle?<br><b>Frank Card<br>Braintree, Essex </b> <br></p> <p>Dawkins should check his facts before bemoaning the ignorance of fellow citizens. Last year the Government's Public Consultation on Developments in the Biosciences, run by MORI, suggested that even people who have been briefed for two days with information officially approved as balanced rejected GM crops. </p> <p>My own research with ActionAid using a citizens' jury of farmers in India reached similar conclusions (<a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org\" target=\"_new\">www.actionaid.org</a>).</p> <p>As a scientist who insists on ignoring the informed assessment of his fellow humans, perhaps Dawkins should apply the Strangelove title to himself.<br><b>Dr Tom Wakeford<br>Human Sciences Dept<br>Brunel University</b><br> </p> <p>As a research scientist at Oxford University and a member of Greenpeace, I support Lord Melchett's views. But I cannot see that Dawkins's diatribe promotes the public understanding of science, or addresses a single issue raised by Greenpeace's long-running campaign. </p> <p>There is a need for research into genetically manipulated or mutilated organisms, but it should be carried out in controlled laboratory conditions until more is known about the spread of artificially mutated genetic material.

  "Teenage police trainees would be deployed in the countryside to combat rural crime under radical Tory plans to free ordinary officers for frontline duties. Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe will this week promise an army of police cadets, retired officers and special constables to provide a 'visible presence' in remote rural communities. <p>She is also considering a controversial privatisation of police custody cells, allowing private security guards to take over booking in and caring for arrested suspects. That would be controversial, given the rate of suspicious deaths in custody. But it would free officers for the beat, as would the cadet scheme Widdecombe will unveil this week at the Tory party conference. </p> <p>'The problem is that the police don't recruit 16-year-olds or even 18-year-olds. A kid who is interested in the police at 16 goes off to do something else and never comes back,' Widdecombe told The Observer . 'We could use a cadet force to produce a greater core of well-trained specials, and I see no reason why we should not start using 18-year-olds shadowing officers.' </p> <p>While school-age cadets would not make arrests on their own, they could join uniformed patrols of part-time officers, reassuring the public in remote areas. In cities they could make up numbers in public order situations like policing football matches. Fresh from her ritual pre-conference trip to the hairdresser, Widdecombe was yesterday on fighting form. But the darling of the Right wants to portray a more thoughtful side this year. She will give the Swinton lecture, on the moral case for law and order: and she hints at surprises up her sleeve. </p> <p>'The caricature that there is of Conservative conferences, that their attitude is hang 'em and flog 'em, is wrong - and the caricature, if it were ever applied to me, is wrong,' she insists. 'It can't all be stick. We need carrot.' </p> <p>She wants to put up to 1,000 more juvenile offenders as young as 12 in secure training centres - but she would halve sentences in return for educational achievement or confronting drug and behavioural problems. She believes passionately in redemption. </p> <p>'I was down in Southampton the other day, in an ordinary road into which a problem family had come. The dad was in prison, the mother wasn't exercising control - or couldn't - and the kids were running wild. I can see exactly where they will be in 20 years' time and I tell you it is heartbreaking.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, William Hague will try to exploit Labour's troubles with pensioners by promising to trump any rise in the basic state pension the Government makes. </p> <p>The Tories would award a flat-rate increase of \u00a38.50 for a single pensioner and \u00a312 for a couple against an expected \u00a35 and \u00a38 from Labour. </p> <p>But Labour will be quick to point out the apparent largesse comes from adding up the extra cash currently spent on the poorest pensioners, free TV licences and winter fuel payments, and redistributing the same money between all OAPs - a shift to benefit the better off most. </p> <p>Hague, due to be interviewed on Breakfast with Frost this morning, is expected to insist he now has New Labour on the run. However, ministers are likely to hit back hard. The Tories first unveiled their pensions package earlier in summer, but it has now been updated to keep pace with expectations that Gordon Brown will do more for pensioners following last week's conference revolt. </p> <p>Shadow social security secretary David Willetts says his alternative to the state pension, for under-30s only, would eventually secure them a pension of \u00a3130 a week on market trends, nearly twice that on offer from the state. </p> <p>The Government would calculate the minimum a worker would ordinarily pay in National Insurance and give this to the individual to invest in approved private schemes. If they ended up without enough to live on, they would still be entitled to state benefits. </p> <p>But Labour is likely to remind voters of the pensions mis-selling scandals of the 1980s, when thousands of public sector workers opted out of their occupational schemes into private plans on which they lost money.</p>",
  "<p>British scientists have carried out four secret operations using tissue taken from aborted foetuses in a bid to save patients from deadly brain diseases. </p> <p>The surgery - condemned last night by anti-abortion groups - is believed to be the first operation involving foetal cell transplants since the technique was abandoned in this country a decade ago. </p> <p>Two centres were involved in the work: Cambridge Uni versity's Brain Repair Centre at Addenbrooke's Hospital, and King's College Hospital, London. All patients were suffering from Huntington's disease, a fatal, inherited brain ailment. </p> <p>Neither unit had revealed that it had carried out the operations. However, in response to Observer inquiries, Addenbrooke's yesterday admitted two foetal cell transplant operations had taken place there in recent weeks and a further two operations will be carried out later this year. Yesterday King's College had still not confirmed it had carried out such surgery. </p> <p>One of the Cambridge team, Dr Roger Barker, said women were asked to donate foetuses for the operation only after they had signed forms signalling their wishes to have abortions. 'There was no inducement or pressure put on these women,' he said. </p> <p>However, the decision to harvest material from aborted foetuses has provoked outrage. A Catholic Church spokesman said such operations could encourage the idea that it was acceptable to kill a child to save an adult, while Professor Jack Scarisbrick, of the anti-abortion group Life, said the operations were a further assault on the unborn. </p> <p>'They give false legitimacy to terminations by suggesting they give hope to others,' he said. 'There is no proven medical benefit to these operations. We are playing with things we just do not understand.' </p> <p>In the late 1980s similar reactions greeted news that surgeons in Birmingham - led by Professor Edward Hitchcock of the Midland Centre for Neurosurgery and Neurology - had carried out foetal cell transplants for Parkinson's disease patients. </p> <p>The outcry led to the abandonment of such operations - although they have since been carried out on a regular basis in other countries, including France and Sweden. In several cases symptoms including loss of balance and stooped gait have disappeared. </p> <p>However, Huntington's disease affects a different part of the brain. 'Parkinson's involves loss of the brain's dopamine-making cells. In Huntington's the striatum - where cells are involved in the control of movement and thought processes - are destroyed by a build-up of toxins,' said Dr Barker. </p> <p>'There is no cure. People suffer dementia and loss of control of movements before they die. By replacing those lost cells we may be able to help patients regain their cognitive and motor powers.' </p> <p>As part of each operation, striatal cells are removed from two foetuses and are then injected into the brains of patients. The Cambridge team's current series of four operations will merely attempt to assess the safety of the technique. </p> <p>'If there are no harmful side-effects, we will then carry out a further six operations next year. We will not know until the end of the 2002 if this technique works or not.' </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:robin.mckie@observer.co.uk\">robin.mckie@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "At least nine Palestinians were killed as violent confrontations with Israeli forces continued for a third day and brought the peace process to a new crisis. <p>Guns, sticks and stones were used in the clashes in Arab East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza yesterday. Among the dead was a 14-year-old Palestinian protester, killed in an exchange of live gunfire in the West Bank city of Nablus. </p> <p>The latest deaths brought to at least 15 the number of Palestinians killed in the past three days. Four of the dead were Palestinian police officers. Two Israeli soldiers werekilled last week. </p> <p>Last night Israeli army chief Shaul Mofaz called a 'ceasefire', saying the violence would stop. But some Palestinians refused to accept it, and clashes continued. </p> <p>Yesterday was supposed to have been a day of mourning. Instead the situation grew steadily out of control. In an alley outside the Haram al- Sharif, the gleaming gold Dome of the Rock mosque in Jerusalem, young Palestinian men collected on a rooftop at the end of afternoon prayers. </p> <p>They piled up their rocks, and waited for the next round. They watched Israeli forces making their own preparations down a gloomy alley. </p> <p>Behind the wall, Palestinian women were gathering blocks of ice for wounds and onions for tear gas, and wrestling with a few hotheads who had brought guns along. </p> <p>Dozens of Israelis stormed in and the alley was engulfed in the percussive roar of stun grenades and tear gas, and the wailing of men hit by rubber bullets. There was a frantic stampede for sanctuary and the long minutes of waiting, marked by the arrival of young men bleeding from head wounds or overcome by tear gas. </p> <p>At last there was quiet. When people dared to look outside, they found smashed cars and water gushing out of the mains on to cobblestones strewn with tear-gas cannis ters, upturned water tankers, and rubble. Guarding the picture of devastation were scores of Israeli troops, now firmly back in charge, of this lane at least. </p> <p>Such clashes were replicated, often in even more violent form, in the Gaza Strip, and in the West Bank cities of Nablus, Ramallah, Hebron and Bethlehem. Palestinian security sources said 300 had been hurt in Gaza alone. </p> <p>The rioting had been sparked by the provocative visit to the Haram by the hardline Likud leader Ariel Sharon. He is the most hated Israeli in the Arab world, and his presence there was too much to bear. </p> <p>The peace process has been deadlocked over the fate of the Haram, holy both to Jews and Muslims. Last week President Clinton was testing reactions to the idea of sharing control over it. Now such ideas seem further from reality than ever. In many parts of the West Bank and Jerusalem, Islamic clerics and Palestinian officials confessed they were powerless to contain their people's rage. </p> <p>'Now I can say for sure that things are out of control,' said Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian official in charge of Jerusalem affairs. </p> <p>He said he had pleaded with the Israeli authorities to stop the visit by Sharon, which Palestinians see as a brazen attempt to assert Jewish sovereignty over the Haram, the third holiest shrine in Islam. Their failure to do so, he said, was directly responsible for the bloodshed. </p> <p>Such warnings were ignored, with Israeli officials claiming it was the right of every citizen to visit the Haram, or as they call it the Temple Mount, which they revere as the site of their destroyed temple. </p> <p>Now, in the lanes of Jerusalem's Old City, the Palestinians say they have only begun to fight. They have draped the gate to the Haram in a huge Palestinian flag and plastered the walls with photos of the newest martyr to the struggle for control of Arab East Jerusalem. </p> <p>Israel's Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, has blamed the violence directly on the Palestinian leadership.</p>",
  "The financial affairs of hundreds of loyalist and republican paramilitaries are to come under scrutiny by the Government's agency set up to seize criminal assets. <p> The Observer has learnt that any paramilitary or ordinary criminal with more than \u00a320,000 in the bank will be investigated by the Confiscation Agency. If they cannot account for the money, the agency will have powers through the civil courts to take cash, cars, property and other assets from them. The \u00a320,000 threshold for financial investigation will be one of the lowest in Europe. Pursuing suspects through the civil courts will entail shifting the burden of proof from the security services to those under investigation, making a prosecution easier to obtain. </p> <p>In loyalist areas such as the Lower Shankill in Belfast, paramilitary leaders travel about in four-wheel-drive vehicles, wear expensive jewellery and take luxury holidays in the Caribbean despite being officially on the dole. Their lavish lifestyles are in the main financed through the drugs trade. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, announced the establishment of the Confiscation Agency at the Labour Party conference in Brighton last week. He said the aim of the agency was to combat the 'mafia culture' which has burgeoned since the ceasefires. It will be based in Belfast, and although staffed by civil servants will have an input from the RUC, Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue and MI5. </p> <p>A senior RUC officer told The Observer : 'We have argued that investigators should start probing the accounts of these people at \u00a320,000 and over because there are so many mini-criminal empires out there. It will allow us to get to those who bankroll crime and paramilitaries in a way that's not been tried before.' </p> <p>A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Office confirmed that legislation would be introduced into Parliament before Christmas outlining the scope and nature of the Confiscation Agency. It was expected to be up and running before next summer. </p> <p>The new agency will be modelled on the Criminal Assets Bureau in the Irish Republic, set up to tackle Dublin drug barons.</p>",
  "'You are now entering Free Derry' the slogan painted in black letters on a white wall, has become one of the most enduring images of the Troubles. It has been seen over and over again on television often as the background to violent clashes between the security forces and the people of the Bogside. <p>Over the years most of the Sinn Fein leaders associated with the long march from armed rebellion to political respectability have addressed the supporters here. Just across the road a youthful Martin McGuinness, at that time an IRA leader in Derry, made his first public speech. It was short and to the point: 'It doesn't matter what John Hume says. We'll fight on until we get a united Ireland.' </p> <p>Now Free Derry Corner is to become, officially, a national monument. Last week an alliance of Sinn Fein and the SDLP on the city council voted that the area should be handed over to the Department of the Environment's Heritage Service. The Minister who will be responsible for looking after it is Sam Foster, an Ulster Unionist member of the new power sharing executive. </p> <p>It is a potent symbol of changing times. The slogan 'You are now entering Free Derry' was first painted on to the gable end of a small terraced house in the Bogside in 1969. It was during an uneasy period when the Civil Rights movement was holding massive rallies to protest against discrimination but before the Army was sent to Northern Ireland. The row of cramped houses was later demolished but the gable wall was left standing by itself and the area became known as Free Derry Corner. </p> <p>It was a focal point of republican defiance. Each year the march held to commemorate Bloody Sunday in Derry, when 13 marchers were shot by the British soldiers, ended with a rally here. It was at this wall that Bernadette Devlin spoke to reporters when she was released from jail. </p> <p>Free Derry Corner has changed in recent years as peace has become a reality. There are landscaped flowerbeds. On nearby walls large and graphic murals depict key moments of the area's history over the past 30 years. </p> <p>It has become a tourist attraction. American visitors come in coachloads. Sometimes a group of British squaddies, coming to the end of a tour of duty, will venture up to Free Derry Corner to have their photographs taken. But the old revolutionary spirit persists. Local groups campaigning on such contentious issues as abortion and gay rights use the back of the wall to put across their message. </p> <p>Free Derry Corner was not the only historic monument in the city to change hands last week. By a pleasant irony the Ministry of Defence announced that Fort George, which has been the Army's headquarters in the west side of Derry for almost 30 years, is to be handed back to its original owners. The Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners planned to build a flagship commercial development on the 15-acre site. </p> <p>The decision to leave Fort George is part of the Government's programme to reduce the security presence in Northern Ireland. Six Army bases along the border in Co Fermanagh are also to be demolished. The Army points out that 40 military bases and installations have been closed down since 1995. At the moment there are 13,500 soldiers in the province. The hope is that, all being well, this figure will be cut to 8,000. Sinn Fein describes this process as demilitarisation. The Army prefers the more hopeful term normalisation. Unionists have been critical of this scaling down of the Army presence, which they claim is being done to pander to the IRA. </p> <p>Others see it as part of a deliberate strategy to extract concessions from the IRA to help David Trimble. </p> <p>The issue of policing and the demands of nationalist leaders for a full implementation of the Patten Report make it very difficult for the Government to move on that front. But a dramatic gesture from the IRA, such as another inspection of its arms dumps by internationally respected figures, might help Trimble fend off his critics. </p> <p>It often seems that the peace process in Northern Ireland simply lurches from crisis to crisis. But at a political level there has been much more steady progress. Last week Trimble, accompanied by most of his Ministers, came to Dublin for the second plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council. In Belfast, the names of 60 members of the new Civic Forum were announced. This will act as a wide-ranging consultative body to the assembly. </p> <p>This is how peace is built - slowly and with great difficulty. It will take a long time to complete the long journey from armed conflict to reconciliation. But in Derry at least, people believe that it is time to move on. Free Derry Corner is now seen as part of the city's history, a place for respect and conservation, but no longer a rallying point for rebellion against the state.</p>",
  "If the Scottish Conservative Party has a new face and a new future, it is personified by Annabel Goldie, a friendly, jolly woman who wears her ideology lightly, has cast aside her opposition to home rule and wants to make the new Parliament in Edinburgh a successful part of an evolving British constitution. <p>Only three years ago the Tories, reviled as an 'English party', were wiped out in Scotland at the general election. Now Goldie, 50, deputy Conservative leader in the Parliament and MSP for the West of Scotland, believes they are on track to win back seats both for Westminster and Edinburgh. Earlier this year they shook Labour by winning the Ayr by-election, adding a directly elected member to their 18 list MSPs. </p> <p>She says: 'It is one of the consummate ironies of politics that devolution has been the instrument of renaissance for the Conservatives in Scotland.' It was right, she argues, to oppose it in principle but now it has become reality the party has embraced it with enthusiasm and 'great spirit'. </p> <p>At first sight Goldie seems an archetypal West of Scotland Unionist. She is a lawyer and an elder of the Kirk. She is active in the councils of the Salvation Army, sits on the court of her old university, Strathclyde. She is a deputy lieutenant of her native county, Renfrewshire. </p> <p>Her father, a stockbroker and later a shopkeeper, was 58 when she was born. And although she was clearly influenced by his table talk on politics, she says she developed her own political convictions. </p> <p>She recalls: 'I was about 13 or 14, and Harold Wilson had just come to power after 13 years of Conservative rule. My interest was sparked by the sheer innovation of what was happening. </p> <p>'I remember coming to my own conclusions - that nationalisation was a bizarre way to run an economy, that comprehensive education was a strange way to encourage the best in young minds. I remember thinking \"I don't think this is a correct way to run a country at all\".' </p> <p>But she did not become involved in active politics for many years, concentrating first on establishing herself in a Glasgow legal firm. </p> <p>Gradually politics took hold. Although Westminster held no attractions ('I love my life in Scotland'), she stood at the 1992 general election for Renfrew West and Inverclyde, giving Labour's Tommy Graham a close run. </p> <p>She emerged as a healing figure in the party after a period of turbulence caused by disputes between radicals and traditionalists. She became vice-chairman in 1992 and chairman in 1997. </p> <p>Goldie is an admirer of Malcolm Forsyth. And, though she admires in politicians a willingness to have a vision, no matter how confrontational, she says: 'Politics is the art of the possible. Politicians must always remember that no matter how interesting your ideology may be, it will never achieve anything in practice unless you take people with you.' </p> <p>She recognises the Tories will benefit more from Labour's difficulties in England than in Scotland where there is the SNP to share the spoils. But she says: 'What is startling is the swiftness with which Labour's weaknesses have become manifest.' </p> <p>She explains: 'This is a government that has been there for only three years. The Conservatives were there for 18 years. But this is a Labour government that came in on a wave of triumphalism, saying \"We're the song of change, we're the instrument of change\". Now they find themselves in deep, deep trouble.' </p> <p>She says William Hague, from 'very, very difficult circumstances,' has regrouped his party and made it an Opposition presence. 'Where Labour has been extremely short-sighted is not to recognise the potency of public opinion. Not to recognise that so soon before a general election some would say is political naivety which is quite startling.' </p> <p>She attacks the Scottish Executive not only because it is 'arrogant' but because it is not sufficiently free-thinking. Labour, she believes, is afraid of its creation. She says the Executive is perceived as a 'puppet of London'. </p> <p>'It's a control regime, and I think that ethos of control comes from the Prime Minister - I don't think there's any question of that. The Scottish Executive feels inhibited. And that to me is highly, highly dangerous because that could be a repressive influence on devolution instead of allowing devolution to breathe, and evolve.' </p> <p>The other consequence of devolution, she believes, is that 'as time goes past and as circumstances emerge there probably will be a need to look at some of the powers and see if any amendment is needed.' </p> <p>She sees the UK constitution moving towards a 'lopsided' federalism. 'If you said to any constitutional expert, how would you devise a form of federal government for the United Kingdom, this is not what he would come up with because it lacks the equilibrium a federal structure enjoys in other countries... But it may all be part of the evolution of the constitution.' </p> <p>She recognises the Nationalists, under their new leader John Swinney, believe the Parliament is a passport to independence. She says there may have to be a 'vigorous' debate to test whether such an idea would not be 'dangerous lunacy'. She thinks it is the duty of three unionist parties in the Parliament to resist any such idea. </p> <p>'There's a huge obligation on the parties which believe in the United Kingdom to start demonstrating to the people of Scotland that a devolved Parliament can deliver for them, and has the capacity to envisage a better life for them.' </p> <p>For Goldie herself the Parliament is clearly an absorbing experience. What the Tories offer, she says, is a 'manageable' agenda. She promises 'prudence' and warns against unsustainable spending programmes. </p> <p>For all her criticisms of the Executive, she remains hopeful about the Parliament's future. It has the chance to make meaningful improvements to public services, to support the university sector and to reverse Scotland's indifference to the enterprise culture. 'And we can do all this within the United Kingdom. There's a very, very exciting future.'</p>",
  "Oil giant BP has been accused of 'rank hypocrisy' after major safety breaches at British sites that risked thousands of lives. <p>During the recent fuel crisis, BP gave concern for the safety of employees as its reason for not ordering drivers to deliver fuel. Yet, in spite of record profits of \u00a34,000 a second because of the soaring oil price, BP put staff and public in danger with cost-cutting measures. </p> <p>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has launched an investigation into BP's 'corporate culture'. Safety breaches include: </p> <p>\u0095 Three major incidents last spring at its Grangemouth refinery complex in Scotland led to emergency alerts. In June, a fire broke out which took seven hours to control. Grangemouth contains 200 tonnes of highly flammable chemicals. Earlier in June a pipe exploded, blasting tonnes of earth on to a main road. In May the plant was shut after its main power cable failed. There were seven major safety alerts in the past 14 months at Grangemouth; </p> <p>\u0095 The HSE was so alarmed by reductions in staffing levels at BP's Coryton refinery in Essex that in January 1999 it ordered the firm to stop operating part of its plant because it believed it could not shut it down in an emergency. In April 1999 the company was prosecuted after two contractors were overcome by nitrogen fumes; </p> <p>\u0095 BP's main North Sea oil platform was shut down last summer by the HSE after two gas leaks within six days were described as having been 'near catastrophes'; </p> <p>\u0095 Serious breaches of health and safety regulations at BP's Sullom Voe oil terminal in the Shetlands in July 1999 led the government watchdog to demand measures 'to prevent major accidents and limit their consequences to persons and the environment'. </p> <p>Michael Connarty, Labour MP for Falkirk East where Grangemouth is located, has accused BP of 'hypocrisy and double standards'. He said: 'During the fuel crisis BP was telling us it was so concerned to protect the safety of its tanker drivers that it wouldn't force them to deliver petrol. But after the number of safety alerts over the last year workers have been worried sick there could be another major incident where they won't be so lucky. It is amazing that no one has been killed.' </p> <p>At Grangemouth, 600 workers will lose their jobs by 2002. </p> <p>BP's record has also come under fire after breaches of pollution legislation. This month's edition of Ends - the respected environmental magazine - contains an attack on the oil giant's environmental record. This will embarrass the company, which has recently spent millions on rebranding itself to promote its green credentials by jettisoning its shield logo and using a sunflower. </p> <p>At its Sullom Voe terminal BP breached rules over how much oil may be discharged into the sea 17 times in the year 1999-2000. A Scottish Environment Protection Agency spokesman said the breaches were minor, but 'the fact there were 17 over a year makes them significant'. The Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment found them serious enough to withdraw certification of the terminal - the first time this has happened in the UK. </p> <p>In May 1999, BP faced a record fine for pollution in Scotland after it overfilled a tank of the Scottish Borders Council recycling centre. This contaminated the River Tweed, and BP was fined \u00a315,000 and had to pay \u00a3200,000 in clean-up costs. Grangemouth has had a 24 per cent increase in discharge of pollutants and a fourfold increase in oil losses from spills. </p> <p>A BP spokesman said: 'Unfortunately accidents can happen. But, regardless of any cost-cutting, safety is never compromised. When an accident happens our priority is to find out why and work with the authorities to ensure it never happens again.'</p>",
  "Tony Knox will be sick with terror when he boards a train this Thursday to take him to the spot just outside Paddington Station where exactly a year ago he hurtled into hell. <p>He is too traumatised to drive his car. Some mornings Knox manages to get to his local station, Reading, and buy a ticket, but sits on the platform for three hours unable to force himself onto a train. </p> <p>But this week he is determined to face the fear so that he can join other passengers who were injured and the families of the 31 who were killed in the rail crash at Ladbroke Grove on 5 October last year and pay his respects to those who lost their lives. </p> <p>And he is also determined to travel in order to vent his fury at the Government and the privatised rail industry as they continue to drag their feet over rail safety. </p> <p>'I feel completely betrayed by the Government,' he said. </p> <p>He feels Labour has broken its promises by pressing ahead with a 'cheap and cheerful' safety device to stop trains going through red signals, which falls short of a fully automatic system. </p> <p>This weekend, Knox called on Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott and Transport Minister Lord Macdonald to resign and for rail bosses - and, eventually, under new corporate killing legislation, for Ministers - to be jailed over crashes that happen when they are in charge. </p> <p>The inquiry into the rail disaster at Ladbroke Grove - chaired by Lord Cullen - has been told of companies displaying 'incompetence and negligence', refusing to invest in the best safety measures while making massive profits. Bosses such as Martin Ballinger and Chris Moyes of Thames Trains have just awarded themselves bonuses of more than \u00a330,000, on top of six-figure salaries. It was a Thames driver who shot a red signal outside Paddington and smashed into a Great Western train. </p> <p>Railtrack chief executive Gerald Corbett waived his bonus but allowed senior managers to accept theirs despite the company's failure to deal with the confusing track and signal layout around Paddington that had almost caused crashes before. </p> <p>Meanwhile, most of the victims of Ladbroke Grove have yet to receive compensation and have been warned by survivors of the Southall crash in 1997 not to expect much. Families whose relatives were under the age of 18 are likely to get as little as \u00a37,500. </p> <p>Knox, 41, was thrown out of his seat on the Great Western train in the crash. His smashed ribs and lacerations have healed, but even with weekly therapy sessions the nightmares do not stop and he cannot concentrate on everyday matters. He fears he will soon lose his job as a senior lecturer at London's South Bank University. 'Sometimes my nightmares re-enact the whole scene, with the fireball coming at me down the train. I get out, past dead bodies, and then try and rescue screaming passengers, but can't,' he said. </p> <p>First Great Western has refused to install stronger hammers than the ones that snapped when passengers tried to smash windows to get out of the burning train. </p> <p>Knox will be carrying a steel claw hammer in his bag when he travels on Thursday. At the crash site he will join Pam Warren. She still wears the plastic mask almost 24 hours a day that protects the scar tissue on her burnt face. </p> <p>A year on, Warren holds the Government ultimately responsible. She told The Observer: 'After 12 months there has been no constructive change to railway safety. Every morning I wake up expecting another crash. It is not a question of if an accident like Ladbroke Grove will happen again but when.' </p> <p>This week campaigners intend to expose the lack of progress on improving safety. </p> <p>The number of trains shooting red signals has fallen sharply, but the number of incidents regarded by the safety authorities as serious - risking a derailment or collision - has not fallen. Campaigners want 'zero tolerance' of signals passed at danger (spads) and say the fact there are still around 10 spads a week means the industry is playing with passengers' lives. </p> <p>But there is still a huge row about the right technology to prevent such events. The Government insists it is doing its best to force through practical solutions to the difficult problem of providing ATP - automatic train protection - on an ageing network. </p> <p>Existing technology, such as the system in operation on the Great Western line, was recommended for the whole network after the Clapham crash in 1988, but has never been properly introduced and is now out of date. The new generation of ATP now being developed to comply with European laws is not yet available and could take 10 years to introduce. </p> <p>Campaigners say the Government should have corrected past mistakes and heeded its calls in Opposition for ATP by introducing it on taking office in 1997. It should provide the cash where necessary, they say, and force the industry to order the European ATP systems. </p> <p>A spokesman for John Prescott said the Government was pressing ahead with a system called TPWS, which gives only 70 per cent protection (compared with ATP's 98 per cent). This was the quickest interim measure for saving lives while ATP was being updated, said the spokesman. </p> <p>Prescott has insisted that 'cost is not the issue' and is committed to forcing introduction of the new generation ATP, although probably only for high-speed lines, if Cullen recommends it.</p> <p><b>Still in shock... </b><br><b>Pam Warren:</b> Wears a facemask over scars from horrific burns. 'I hold the Government responsible.' <b>Tony Knox: </b> Severely traumatised. Likely to lose his career. 'We've been completely betrayed.' </p> <p><b>In the dock...</b><br><b>John Prescott:</b> Has failed to commit to Automatic Train Protection despite saying: 'Cost is not an object.' <b>Railtrack's Gerald Corbett:</b> Has failed to deal with major safety flaws in company where profits come first. He claims: 'Safety is our first priority.' <b>Thames Trains' Terrance Worrall: </b> Failed to train drivers properly or invest in safety systems that would have prevented the crash. Admitted there was 'no evidence' that the driver was warned about risky signal outside Paddington station.</p> <p><b>...Blood money: </b><br><b>Go-Ahead Group, owner of Thames Trains: </b> Managing director Martin Ballinger, awarded annual bonus of \u00a336,000, taking annual pay to \u00a3209,000.

  "Every year during the last decade of the Troubles the Ulster Defence Association - Northern Ireland's largest Protestant paramilitary group - held their own ghoulish version of the Oscars. <p>And the star turn at every annual ceremony for the assassins of the UDA in the 1990s for the 'best' assassin of the year was a 30-year-old loyalist from Belfast's Shankill Road nicknamed 'Top Gun'. </p> <p>Stephen McKeag almost always received the trophy for being the 'top operator' among the UDA's assassination squads in the Greater Belfast. The 30-year-old UDA man according to RUC officers killed at least 12 people, most of them ordinary Catholics, during a 10-year campaign that terrorised the nationalist community in the city. </p> <p>For these exploits McKeag was given a plaque made by UDA inmates in the Maze prison with his name and an AK-47 assault rifle engraved in silver. </p> <p>Last weekend, the man who ran the UDA's notorious 'C' company on the Shankill Road while its charismatic leader, Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair, was in prison, died an ignominious death at his house in loyalist North Belfast. </p> <p>At first the UDA believed he had been killed by the rival Ulster Volunteer Force with whom they have been locked in a murderous feud since late August, which has claimed three lives and saw more than 900 people driven from their homes. </p> <p>But it has since emerged McKeag, a legend to young extreme loyalists, died alone, in all probability from a drugs overdose, covered in bruises, alone in his home. Mystery still hangs over his death given that he appeared to have been beaten up and a crossbow bolt was found wedged in the wall of the room where his body was discovered. His life however, in particular those 10 or so years he spent at the cutting edge of the UDA's killing machine, embodies the sub-culture of sectarianism and violence that characterised the second generation of working-class Protestants that emerged from loyalist ghettos during the Troubles. </p> <p>McKeag, like others from 'C' company, graduated from the street violence of the skinhead cult to the junior UDA, the Ulster Young Militants. They came into their own at the end of 1989 when a major investigation into collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces led by the Metropolitan police commissioner Sir John Stevens led to several arrests of key UDA figures. </p> <p>A number of those charged with terrorist offences such as Tommy 'Tucker' Lyttle were regarded by younger loyalists as soft touches who had allowed the UDA's armed campaign to be wound down. Lyttle, it later emerged, was an informer for the RUC Special Branch. </p> <p>With the old guard in the UDA out of the way, the younger, more militant members seized control of the organisation's ruling body, the Inner Council. </p> <p>Once in power, these young, visceral sectarians embarked on a murder campaign directed at times against republican activists but more often simply against ordinary members of the nationalist community. By 1991 and 1992 loyalists, principally the UDA, were outkilling the IRA for the first time. </p> <p>McKeag became one of the UDA's most important assassins in the period between 1990 and the loyalist ceasefire four years later. Of the dozen or so Catholics he murdered, the RUC can pinpoint two specific incidents. In 1993 the UDA shot dead a young shop assistant in a chemist on the Springfield Road in West Belfast. Their intended target had been the sister of a prominent Sinn Fein official but as so often happens in Northern Ireland the killers picked the wrong person. Eyewitnesses who saw the murder gang drive off towards Lanark Way, a main arterial route linking Catholic and Protestant west Belfast, reported that the killers shouted inexplicably: 'Follow the yellow brick road.' One of the gunmen was Stephen McKeag. </p> <p>A year later UDA gunmen entered a hairdresser's shop on the Donegall Road, just off the Falls, and shot dead Sean Hughes. The RUC believe the gunman was McKeag even though the case against him collapsed in court due to the judge's doubts over witness identification. </p> <p>Yet even after the UDA along with the UVF called their ceasefire on October 1994 - just three months after the IRA's historic cessation - McKeag continued to kill. The green light to reactivate the UDA killer gangs came about following the murder of Billy 'King Rat' Wright inside the Maze prison two days after Christmas 1997. </p> <p>Wright had been expelled from the UVF the previous year and formed the anti-ceasefire Loyalist Volunteer Force. His plan had been to build a new alliance with those UDA battalions such as 'C' company on the Shankill which were sceptical about the ceasefire and the peace process. Wright won the admiration and trust of a number of young loyalists including McKeag. </p> <p>By this time McKeag was now the 'commanding officer' of 'C' company because Johnny Adair was in prison, facing 15 years for directing acts of terrorism. Just over a week after the Irish National Liberation Army shot Wright dead in the Maze, McKeag and his colleagues decided to break the ceasefire. They attacked a number of Catholic pubs including the Clifton Tavern in north Belfast, nicknamed fatally by local nationalists as 'the suicide inn'. During that attack in January 1998 McKeag shot dead Edmund Trainor and wounded three other customers. </p> <p>Such was his standing within the violent underworld of loyalist paramilitarism that McKeag even usurped Johnny Adair as a hero figure. When Adair was released early from prison under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in September last year the LVF held a welcome home party for him in Lurgan, Co Armagh. Adair was given a rousing ovation from LVF members and supporters inside a social club. But this was nothing compared to the standing ovation awarded to McKeag, who was called on to the stage and smothered in praise for his role in sectarian assassinations. </p> <p>Yet within six months 'Top Gun' had fallen out of favour with 'C' company's leadership. A series of brawls inside loyalist shebeens and the beating of a number of women involved in a local dispute resulted in McKeag being ordered off the Shankill by his UDA colleagues. He only came back to live in the area when the inter-loyalist feud erupted in late August. Adair and his comrades thought he might be useful in their war with the Shankill UVF. </p> <p>McKeag, however, was understood to be opposed to killing loyalists, albeit rival ones. He took no part in the feuding and according to UVF sources was not regarded as a target. </p> <p>It is known that McKeag had become increasingly addicted to cocaine and was taking the drug when he died. The danger of snorting huge amounts of cocaine was compounded by the fact that he was on highly potent pain killers for injuries sustained during a motorcycle accident in north Belfast six months ago. The car his bike crashed into belonged to a senior member of the UVF, although both factions regarded the collision as an accident. </p> <p>Among the hundreds of wreaths left at his graveside in Roselawn cemetery last week were tiny silver and gold guns - a token of his other addiction, murder. Two wreaths, 10 foot wide, spelled out 'Top Gun'.</p>",
  "It's highly confusing, meeting Kanya King. I don't mean just because of the music-talk stuff, though there is that ...the myriad fine gradations between hip and hop and house, garage and bhangra and gangsta and jungle and trip hop and rap. <p>I think I've got the fundamentals sorted out: house is the stuff that sounds like a giant moron banging in an endless nail with his head, whereas hip hop is the stuff that sounds like four hours of a photocopier warming up. (And no, I'm not being patronising: it's just that if you really don't know, and are at that stage in life where the only bits in the songs that you recognise are the samples stolen from old Steely Dan tracks, then it's terribly trendy-vicar and Mr Tony to try to pretend. Suffice it to say that, according to age, class, number of drugs taken and the increasingly less important factor of race, some of it sounds absurdly glorious and some of it makes your brain bleed.) </p> <p>The confusing thing about Kanya herself, talking about race and class and music, is that she is so relentlessly, hopelessly, nice about everything, to the point of saccharinity. </p> <p>This is a woman born the youngest of a 'very poor' black-Irish family of nine, whose Ghanaian father died when she was 13, whose mother can recall the signs in London which said 'no blacks, no Irish, no dogs' and struggled not only to find them a home but to protect them from the hate-mail and racist packages. </p> <p>Who put herself through college and then, while trying to promote black bands, found herself up against one of the most cynical, white-run businesses in our cynical, white global marketplace. Who then had to fight the business's even more cynical nephew, the 'enlightened' producers who were happy to film black music being made, but only if in a seedy club, with bands that turned up shambolically late or not at all, and perhaps a shooting or two thrown in for good measure. Yo, blood. </p> <p>So you would understand it if Kanya, now 30, the woman behind the phenomenally successful Mobo awards - the formula, denoting 'Music Of Black Origin', which has over the past five years proved subtly adept at promoting black music, or black-by-formation music, without ghettoising it - had a few things to say about race, or class, or corporate cynicism. Well, she does, but they're all awfully nice. </p> <p>We are all living in much more enlightened, multi-cultural times, she beams. Of course, white people can make good 'black' music, she says, to my raised eyebrow (she hasn't obviously played in the same Dundee pubs I have, where the Average White Band's legacy used to be mauled thrice nightly): 'I think, you know, any artist, they're influenced by whoever, but they put their own spin on it, which is important.' Hmm. </p> <p>And there's no resentment of the way the corporations have now muscled in on Mobo after five years of growing success. (This week's awards, for instance, are massively sponsored by a major credit-card company who I'm not going to name because they once refused me a card.) 'No, I think it's important for us to work in harmony with the record companies. </p> <p>No resentment at all, because we don't work in isolation, and at the end you want the artists to have record sales.' Every possible bone of contention I throw at her is sweetly batted back with a wide pragmatic smile. It's like being sucker-punched by a g\u00e2teau. </p> <p>Which is perhaps the way it had to be. After years of black music's associations of anger, mistrust and violence, perhaps it was inevitable - though no less ironic for that - that its success, its biggest breakthrough in Britain, should come in such a very Nineties way, through slick marketing, lack of confrontation, sweet smiles from Kanya and a massive dose of pragmatism.</p> <p>'What we've tried to do is not harp on about what's negative, or doesn't work: this is a celebration.' The front seats at Alexandra Palace will be removed for this week's long-sold-out concert to let fans promenade closer to the stage; Henry Wood's legacy lives on in the new Britain, and race war has left the building. </p> <p>One of the oddest things about Mobo, I suggest, is the blinding obviousness of its categorisation. Surely every piece of rock or pop music for the past half-century is 'of black origin'? Take the black influences out of music and surely all you'd be left with would be a 4/4 on-the-beat tattoo of unimaginative guitar riffs, bereft of clever harmonies, or soul, or surprises. You'd be left with Status Quo. </p> <p>'Absolutely! But that's exactly why it was founded. Most people whole-heartedly agree that most forms of popular music have their heritage in black music, so we wanted to celebrate that fact. And if we can run alongside the Brit awards - we all know the Brits is about the industry, and tends to focus on successful pop - then isn't it wonderful to have another event where those not yet as huge can get recognition, and success?' </p> <p>The subtext here, as she explains, is that, had the awards simply been Black Music Awards, then it could have been 'exclusive rather than inclusive'. So Bono and Mick Hucknall have presented and won awards; white rapper Eminem regularly cleans up. It might offend purists, but my goodness it's working. </p> <p>The voting website took two million hits last month, and Mobo - not just the awards ceremony but the whole package Kanya has been running from her Euston base since hitting on her clever formulation; the publishing company and the production group and the annual album - is about to go international. Her palpable excitement inspires, even though she concedes, her ready smile vanishing for perhaps the only time in our meeting, that America, both black and white America, might be a little less willing to watch (in the words of one of the less inspiringly radical musical-racial collaborations of recent years) ebony and ivory sitting side by side in perfect harmony. </p> <p>Was it possible, I wondered, that her catch-all net was in danger of becoming too wide? She has done, obviously, a magnificent job of promoting good black music. R'n'B, hip hop and dance now account for something approaching 40 per cent of music sales in Britain, the third biggest pop-music market in the world: a figure which has almost doubled since 1994. </p> <p>But was it hard for her to reconcile such diverse strands as, for instance, gospel and rap, one side serving up heavy dollops of Christianity, albeit with a good bit of style, and the other trying to get us to shoot our white nigga ho' bitches with our love guns (or however the precise terminology runs)? </p> <p>'Actually not all rap music is like that at all. That's just the headline stuff. Rap is so broad, I don't think you can generalise. My own favourites depend on my mood. I sometimes listen to hip hop, but then think, oh my God, I need some jazz, or something Irish, ballady. Then again my 17-year-old niece is fanatical about gospel music, and recently organised a concert, and the talent was just phenomenal... but there was also rap at the same concert, from black and white. It's all part of the same, it's all about passion, and believing in something.' </p> <p>And Kanya - still unmarried, she says with the usual huge smile, but not exactly looking - proceeds to get passionate about another Mobo fixture, the Unsigned Act Award, where regional competitions whittle down winners and take them on to contracts and stardom. 'You would not believe the response now, even though it's only being going for a couple of years,' she tells me. Most of the record company executives had said to us - an award show's about winners, nobody's interested in unsigned talent. Of course, they're right. But it's something we're very close to, the grass roots, and we get sent thousands of tapes...so we did it anyway.' </p> <p>No, Kanya. Of course the record company executives were wrong. You were right. But for as long as it suits you to say it, and keep smiling and pretending, and keep the contracts and the music coming, then the pragmatism and the marketing and the careful corporate politicking don't, in the end, seem to matter. In the oldest sense of the word, respect. </p> <p>The Mobo website is: <a href=\"http://www.mobo.net\" target=\"_NEW\">mobo.net</a></p>",

  "In the early hours of Sunday morning two weeks ago I arrived in Belgrade. I was here for the revolution; here to see Milosevic go and I was happy. Happy, but afraid. Afraid of blood, of clashes with the police, and of more horror in this tormented, twisted country. <p>Afraid, as a journalist pretending to be a tourist, I'd be discovered. For the first days my palms were damp. Then, it became clear that Slobodan Milosevic's police had much more important things to worry about than a few strays. </p> <p>Now, a week after the elections, we are still waiting. What should have been swift and clean and beautiful - the people's election of their new president and the end of 13 years of war, darkness and pain - is going too slowly. It is like a graduation dance where everyone is outside the dancehall in their dresses and tuxedos and inside the music is playing, the tables have been laid for dinner - but the door is still locked. </p> <p>A week ago, the night of the election, people worried that the turnout had not been big enough to oust him. Then the news began coming in from the unofficial counts showing clearly that Vojislav Kostunica, the 56-year-old lawyer who had come to symbolise something decent and clean for Serbia at last, had defeated him. Another 24 hours of silence. Would Milosevic accept the results? Then, the news that the crooked Milosevic's Electoral Commission declared a Kostunica victory but not enough for an outright win. There would have to be a second round, they said. The beer drinkers and sausage eaters sighed weary sighs. 'We knew it would not be so easy.' </p> <p>They are desperate to breath again to escape the isolated island of Serbia and its time warp where even the menus are trapped in the past. In the empty dining room of the Majestic Hotel there are great plates of fried steak and sauerkraut. Kaymak, the cheese of boiled milk and salt, is crumbled over rough, damp bread. </p> <p>Every evening the emotional rollercoaster reaches a new peak or trough - sometimes it just grinds on forward. Night after night floods of people gather on the squares, while the bizarre, twisted, official election results slip out. On Thursday the official bulletin said that 7,345,676 people had voted and then, in the next line, gave the official number of people registered to vote as 7,249,831. </p> <p>An important-looking man in a suit with glasses perched on his nose appeared on state television and said something along the lines of a typing error. There were more ghost voters in Kosovo - about 140,000 - people who turned up to mysteriously vote at polling stations that never opened. </p> <p>At night we go visiting, usually to the homes of the friends of my translator, a generation of Serbs who had grown up with Milosevic's wars. They, and the whole town, seem to be drinking, chain-smoking and waiting. Whisky for the election and then, when that was gone, the young red wine that came from a windy farm near Kragujevac in the heart of Serbia. </p> <p>In the background, when anybody could bear to watch it, the state television news RTS continued to churn out Animal Farm results: 'four legs good, two legs bad'. News from around the world saying that in China they were congratulating Serbia on the free and fair election. The phony election monitors, private individuals invited by Milosevic's government, being presented on TV as 'German election monitors' who said this and 'Canadian election monitors' who agreed with them. </p> <p>Sometimes, in the evening, the news is read by a handsome young man in a dark suit and close-cropped hair. 'I used to be in college with him and he seemed quite normal then,' says my translator. </p> <p>On Wednesday night Milosevic appeared on TV addressing his party workers as they prepared for his mythical second round. His face was shinning with exhilaration. He was animated, confident, cajoling. The most hated man in Serbia looked like he was having a good time. </p> <p>The man who won the presidential election, Kostunica, was careful to present another face to his people. In a city of political assassination he goes around without bodyguards - a deliberate act to symbolise a change from the past and that his protectors are the people. Inside the opposition is struggling to find a way forward that will avoid bloodshed. Kostunica, the lawyer, will challenge the official results in the courts. A Russian delegation led by Igor Ivanov will come to Belgrade to try to persuade Milosevic to step down. It was Ivanov who came as emissary during the Kosovan war to tell Milosevic that it was all over for him. </p> <p>By Friday night, in the bar downtown, people were tired. 'Even revolutionaries have to get some rest,' said a friend as she packed up for home. By yesterday a little despair was filtering in. Friday night had been a bad one for the opposition. Only 30,000 people were on the square. The campaign of civil disobedience and strikes doesn't begin until tomorrow. What would they do now? </p> <p>Another Serb friend came in late from work. 'They have to do something with the people. They have to lead them to the presidency and say it belongs to us now. We are losing the momentum.' But Kostunica, aware of the pain and anger locked inside the hearts of his people, is afraid of what he might unleash. For now, for most people, it would be enough if Milosevic simply disappeared. </p> <p>Three days before the election, a fax was sent to the Beta Newsagency in Belgrade - it was the flight plan of a plane that was due to leave Romania for Kazakhstan the day after the elections. The flight plan was genuine, said a flight controller who examined it and identified the pilot as the head of the State Airline Company, Bosco Cvijic. But nothing else was sure. Maybe the words of the secret sender printed carefully were true, maybe not. 'The boss plans to escape on Monday 25th with his family... he will take off for Romania... by helicopter and continue in the Falcon for Kazakhastan. It is no wonder his brother organised diplomatic privileges for him earlier this month. We can stop him.' It was signed 'A friend'. </p> <p>No one published it. Rumours, gossip, Belgrade is full of it. But when this is finally all over, and it will be because Milosevic has already lost the police and army, the probability is that he will be taking a plane somewhere - and it will not be The Hague. </p> <p>Politically, that would suit the outside world and it would also suit many in Serbia who felt better ignoring what was happening in Sarajevo, Srebrenica, Vukovar. Kostunica has said he won't hand him over to The Hague - a court backed by nations that once bombed Serbia. The British and French governments who opposed intervention during the terrible years of the Croatian and Bosnian wars and treated Milosevic like a statesman would prefer a quiet retirement for him. </p> <p>But there are so many, many others. Croatia, 1991, a three-year-old boy on the slab of a morgue in Dubrovnik with paisley floral turn-ups on his small jeans; in the central Bosnian town of Tuzla in July 1995, a woman hanging from a tree after making it out of Srebrenica but then deciding she could not go on living; the mothers, daughters and lovers of 7,000 men and boys who were executed there; the women who were raped by Milosevic-sponsored paramilitaries in the long summer of 1992; or in Kosovo, last year, a woman who held the body of her youngest child, for just a few seconds more, before laying it carefully in the truck taking the bodies of all her four children to a dump outside the town of Suva Reka. </p> <p>But here we expect to wake up some morning and he will simply be gone. Perhaps, the Russians are coming to promise him a piece of land on the Black Sea. The thing he misses most these days is swimming. Indicted and trapped in Serbia, he is cut off from the Adriatic sea he loves at Kupare. A place where he used to swim before he began destroying so many, many lives.</p>",
  "The approval of a self-administered abortion pill by the US Food and Drug Administration last week threw the knife-edge presidential election campaign into a domain of American politics the candidates had hitherto managed to avoid: the moral battleground. <p>A campaign so far marked by a fight for centre-field voters over the nitty-gritty of Medicare and education is suddenly set to be blown open by emotional issues that arouse political passions in America: gay rights, race, state power, the division between church and state.</p> <p>This may not be a headline-grabbing election like those fought by Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan, but it is the closest and most politically polarised for decades. And nowhere is that polarisation more stark, and the battle so close and bitter, as over these 'social' issues, and for the terrain on which they are adjudicated: the Supreme Court, where the busiest term for many years begins tomorrow.</p> <p>The US Supreme Court and its appellate subsidiaries may not even get a mention in Tuesday night's first presidential TV debate between the candidates. But the appointments the next US president makes to its bench will have a greater impact on the core of society than either candidate could hope to have, with judgments far outliving their terms of office.</p> <p>'For the Supreme Court, this is the most significant election of my lifetime,' said C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel under George Bush senior. The present Supreme Court, headed by chief justice William Rehnquist, is the most narrowly divided for decades. The court had been a conservative bastion, but two appointments by Clinton turned it into a closely balanced scale which the slightest weight can tip decisively to the right or to the left - which is exactly what Bush and Gore intend to do, in opposite directions.</p> <p>The court is up for grabs, with the next president likely to make two or three lifetime appointments. Its most liberal member, Justice John Paul Stevens, is 80 and likely to leave during the next presidential term. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a 'floating' moderate, is also likely to leave soon. Justice Rehnquist himself turns 76 today.</p> <p>The court's decisions on major issues over the past two presidential terms have invariably been settled 5-4, occasionally 6-3, with Clinton's judges, Stephen Beyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, all but cancelling out the ultra-conservatives Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas who consistently take a hard right-wing line which Bush junior loves.</p> <p>The court tomorrow sets out on a term with several crucial cases, concerning free speech, labour and disability law, federal civil rights, search-and-seizure laws, citizenship rights of children born to only one US parent and prisoners' rights. And now, inevitably, abortion.</p> <p>Thursday's decision to license the abortion pill sent the anti-abortion lobby into a flurry of soul-searching and discussion of new tactics, with many pledging that legal action - likely to end up before the Supreme Court - will be among them. There is no issue over which Gore and Bush are more at odds - and no issue over which they are as anxious to ensure a place for their point of view on the Supreme Court bench.</p> <p>It was the Supreme Court which, in the historic Roe v. Wade ruling of 1992, established every woman's right to terminate a pregnancy. And while the Food and Drug Administration has passed the abortion pill, three votes on the Supreme Court bench are ready to overturn 'Roe v. Wade'. Other conservative judges stand by Roe - but by only five votes to four.</p> <p>One appointment could shift that balance, and moderates may be reluctant to remove the many barriers to abortion - and to getting the pill - that state authorities can still place on the process.</p> <p>Apart from abortion, the most controversial area of recent Supreme Court rulings has been the death penalty, a matter of disagreement between Gore and Bush. There is a sway in public opinion (especially the legal profession) against the death penalty. The Rehnquist court has ruled extensively but narrowly on death penalty cases: it has allowed for the execution of the mentally retarded and of children.</p> <p>'For the 3,682 men, women and children on death rows across the nation,' says Stephen Bright of the Southern Center for Human Rights, 'this election is literally a matter of life and death. The court could play a greater role in restricting the use of the death penalty, or could give the states free rein to carry out more and more executions'.</p> <p>Underlying the relationship between the court and the issues of both abortion and the death penalty is the notion of 'states' rights' and federalism - the core of American constitutional politics. Justice Rehnquist has made the defence of 'states rights' his hallmark, and his Supreme Court has knocked back the expansion of federal law to a degree that even prevented the criminalisation of possession of guns in school. </p>",
  "The district of Keratsini never made it into guidebooks. Seven miles south-west of Athens, its concrete mazes are shrouded in fumes from a power plant. Electricity pylons and pools of stagnant water punctuate the gaps between backgammon bars. <p>Vasilis Yiannakis, a bright, silent teenager with few prospects, decided the only one way to escape was to become a sea captain. His seaman father would take him to Piraeus port to watch the triple-deck ferries docking. </p> <p>Huge, powerful, gleaming white, they were the pride of Greece's merchant fleet. Among them was the new 345ft, 4,407-ton Express Samina, then called Golden Vergina. That was 34 years ago. </p> <p>Yiannakis, now 52, graduated from naval college and became a cadet plying the Aegean with millions of tourists discovering the Greek islands. Thousands of cadets dreamed of commanding their own ship, but only a few made it. Yiannakis was one. Glamour and success were his, but the swaggering he left to others. He got on with the job and his reputation for seamanship grew. </p> <p>'He is very experienced and skilled,' said Tessy Economopoulo, of the shipping magazine Efoplistis. Today he will appear handcuffed in court on the island of Syros, charged with multiple manslaughter, neglect of duty and violation of maritime procedures. Last week he became the most hated man in Greece, blamed for 75 deaths and plunging an industry into crisis. </p> <p>Haggard and drawn, he has admitted responsibility. Survivors and relatives of the dead are baying for his blood. His distraught son, daughter and wife are on their way to Syros, pursued by the media. 'What can I say?' the wife asked a friend. 'That I love my husband? And stand by him? Is that what they want?' </p> <p>Divers yesterday searched for more bodies in the wreck, crumpled on the seabed two miles from the resort island of Paros. It smashed last Tuesday at nearly full speed into rocks marked with a beacon. How could it happen? </p> <p>The answer, already encrusted with myth, begins three decades ago when the golden era of Greek shipping began yielding to commercial imperatives. Most of the annual 10 million passengers wanted speed and economy. To make a profit, Minoan Flying Dolphins, which persuaded the government to grant it a virtual monopoly, needed to cut costs. Ferries rusted but were not replaced. </p> <p>Owners kept at least 18 ferries in service by stretching the EU's 27-year limit for decommissioning to 35. 'Monopolies are no good for anyone. They press and press for more money,' said Vangelis Kouzilos, president of the Greek masters and mates union. </p> <p>Yiannakis complained to Efoplistis about his ship's faults. Five years ago all systems failed as it entered Karlovassi port on Samos and he averted disaster by steering with anchors. He later said: 'Did God shine a light on me? In these situations other powers are at work.' </p> <p>Minoan Flying Dolphins, a subsidiary of Minoan Lines, which renamed the ship Express Samina, says inspectors judged it seaworthy. </p> <p>In 1989, when working for another company, Yiannakis grounded the ferry Nirius off the coast of Rhodes, and sank it a month later after crashing into Crete harbour. According to the Greek media he was not on the bridge either time. </p> <p>The improving economy has made jobs on land more attractive than the sea. The annual intake of cadets has plunged from thousands to hundreds. Yiannakis's personality compounded the problem. 'He's a quiet and patient man, perhaps too quiet and patient. He gets saddled with crew no other captains want. Perhaps he should be more assertive,' said Economopoulo. </p> <p>Last Tuesday at 5pm he sailed from Piraeus and headed south-east for Paros, the first of six overnight stops en route to Lipsis island, as he had done six, sometimes eight, times a week for 10 years. Maritime law says he should be on the bridge seven miles from the approach to land but familiarity appears to have bred complacency. </p> <p>A crewman who sailed with him for more than 20 years said: 'He knows these waters like the back of his hand. He does not have to look at charts. Leaving the bridge to junior officers is routine. If he is a criminal then we are all criminals. Other captains are saying \"There but for the grace of God, go I\",' said Economopoulo. </p> <p>Thus was the scene set for tragedy as the Express Samina approached Paros, steaming at 18 knots through gale-force winds and waves. </p> <p>The captain has admitted he left the bridge 'for a little sleep'. Some passengers say he was among the crew members watching a European football match between Hamburg and Panathinaikos. First Officer Anastasios Psychoyos then allegedly left the bridge to flirt with a passenger, leaving the duty helmsman, Panayiotis Gastaglis, alone. Gastaglis claimed he did not see the rocks until 60ft to 90ft ahead because instruments failed to show that wind had thrown him off course. Psychoyos says he raced to the bridge and wrestled with the wheel 600ft from the rocks. But they tore a 300ft gash in the ferry's side. The captain ran to the bridge. </p> <p>Within minutes the vessel was listing. Chaos erupted. About 530 passengers, including over 100 tourists, tumbled into corridors screaming and jostling for life vests. At first the crew did not think the ship would sink. They told people to remain inside. </p> <p>Tourists were luckier. 'We couldn't understand the language, so we made smarter decisions,' said Heidi Hart, 30, of Seattle. Plunging into the sea, the 12 Britons and almost all foreigners survived, picked up by British helicopters and Paros fishing boats. Heroism abounded: conscripts held up babies in the water and donated their vests; crewmen died trying to release a lifeboat. The death toll may rise above 80 as divers explore coves and crack open doors on the starboard side. </p> <p>Branded a murderer by the press, condemned by the government, disowned by his employer, Yiannakis is a broken man. Seafaring unions defend him as a victim of circumstance. A better scapegoat would be Minoan Line, they say. Its monopoly is imperilled: the government could announce shipping's deregulation next week. </p> <p>The boy from Keratsini who made good faces a lifetime in jail. He will never command again.</p>",
  "The French are sick of their politicians. When one of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's Ministers pressed the flesh in Lyons last week, onlookers shouted: 'All politicians are corrupt!' <p>The still centre of the political storm blowing around the country's latest scandal about political slush funds is President Jacques Chirac. He has been keeping his head down while all about him have been losing theirs. The accusations that the coffers of Chirac's party, the RPR, had been swollen by covert funds during the Eighties were made in a dramatic fashion from beyond the grave. </p> <p>Jean-Claude M\u00e9ry, a former financier for Chirac's party, recorded an interview on videotape in 1996 pointing the finger at his former boss and accusing him of corruption. M\u00e9ry died last year, so the release of the tape and its damaging publication in Le Monde were posthumous. 'A ghost has just accused Chirac,' reported one newspaper. </p> <p>On tape, M\u00e9ry claimed that while Chirac was mayor of Paris in the Eighties he ran a covert fund into which was pumped cash from companies awarded municipal contracts. He also claimed he opened a briefcase containing cash kickbacks worth 4.5 million francs (\u00a3450,000) while Chirac was in the room. M\u00e9ry said it was his job to collect funds covertly for the RPR from firms which had been given contracts to install lifts and paint hallways in high-rise Paris council estates. </p> <p>To many the charges seemed to warrant a detailed rebuttal. But Chirac has only made one short blanket denial on French TV, denouncing M\u00e9ry's charges as an 'abracadabra tale' spun for political motives. </p> <p>Chirac may well have been following the precepts laid down by his mentor, Charles de Gaulle, who said in 1963: 'To be above suspicion is not only a question of not doing anything wrong; it's also about not showing the slightest sign of weakness.' </p> <p>The only problem is that there is every sign that the French people don't believe Chirac, and instead want him to come clean about how the RPR raised its money at a time when legislation on party funding scarcely existed. In a poll last Wednesday, 76 per cent said the revelations made it imperative that the president accounted for himself in detail. </p> <p>A poll in the daily Le Parisien last Thursday found 67 per cent of respondents believed France's latest corruption scandal had besmirched the image of the country's political class. </p> <p>And this in the week after 70 per cent of the electorate could not be bothered to turn out for a referendum that was widely believed to have everything to do with politicians' abstruse constitutional wranglings and nothing to do with the real daily concerns of French people. 'Le rejet de la politique' (the rejection of politics) is a headline that more than one French newspaper used last week to catch the mood of alienation. </p> <p>'We need an early presidential election and the resignation of the government to relieve our disgust,' the news magazine L'Express said in an editorial. Even a political adviser to the president's RPR party this week whined: 'How many times must we see the power of the executive so abased? The Republic has a bloody face.' </p> <p>The scandal has done nothing for France's international reputation. 'We are the fourth largest power in the world and we are reduced to holding debates that are totally humiliating and degrading for all politicians and for our democracy,' said Patrick Devedjian, a presidential adviser and party spokesman. </p> <p>But just as the Socialist Party was delighting in Chirac's discomfort, it too became embroiled in the scandal. It turned out that the original videotape of M\u00e9ry's allegations had been in the hands of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a leading Socialist politician who resigned from the government earlier this year over allegations of false accounting at his law firm. </p> <p>According to French media accounts, a tax lawyer may have given Strauss-Kahn the tape while he was Finance Minister in exchange for going easy on couturier Karl Lagerfeld's tax bill. Strauss-Kahn and Lagerfeld denied there was any such deal, and the former Minister claimed he had never even watched the tape. </p> <p>Sixty politicians and businessmen are under investigation as a result of M\u00e9ry's allegations - including the mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi. </p> <p>But French politics has been fraught with corruption for decades, and all the major parties have been embroiled. Socialists and Gaullists alike took big gifts from firms and many politicians frequently siphoned these funds from party coffers into their own pockets. Socialist corruption cost the party the 1993 general election. Even the current Communist leader, Robert Hue, and his predecessor, Georges Marchais, faced a judicial investigation over misplaced party funds in 1996. </p> <p>Indeed, what has been most astounding down the years, for those enamoured of purported Anglo-Saxon probity, is that France seems to be another country in which public funds are often treated as spoils to be carved up for private gain. </p> <p>How else can one explain the \u00a320,000 given by a now-jailed RPR official to Xavi\u00e8re Tiberi, wife of the mayor of Paris, for a 36-page report which she largely plagiarised from a textbook? Or the case of former RPR Prime Minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 who, while he was in charge of Paris's finances in the early Nineties, rented flats for himself and three members of his family at far below market rents and arranged that his own luxury apartment be refurbished at a cost to the council of more than<b> </b> \u00a3100,000? </p> <p>Corruption hasn't just been a Parisian problem: the mayors of cities such as Lyons and Grenoble were disgraced during corruption scandals in the Eighties and early Nineties. Nice's mayor even flew off to Uruguay to avoid criminal charges and a bill for \u00a32m in unpaid taxes. </p> <p>The French hoped to put all this behind them when, in 1994, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur banned all party funding by companies. Today only individuals can contribute to party coffers. But the scandals continue, and these donations are topped up by some state support. </p> <p>Chirac is not obliged to say anything on the M\u00e9ry case, because presidential privilege prevents him from being questioned or charged over the affair. But one of the most sophisticated electorates in the world, which may or may not return him as president in 2002 or before, might well appreciate it if he did.</p>",
  "<p>Sony Corporation's products are the stuff of the Zeitgeist of the consumer age. Walkmans, Discmans, laptops and most recently WAP phones, marketed to the dance generation, have let Sony promote itself - despite the scale of its operations - as the funky face of global enterprise. </p> <p>There have, of course, been a few hiccups in the company's glossy corporate image - notably George Michael's highly publicised and successful extrication from his Sony recording contract, amid accusations of Sony's suits stifling and bullying the creative urge. But it has done little to take the shine off a generation's favourite manufacturer. In Prague last week the eco-warriors weren't stomping their Walkmans. Anti-capitalist activists carried placards lambasting McDonald's, but it is the sort of stick Sony has avoided. </p> <p>All that is likely to change, however, as news gets around that the entertainment and technology giant advocates spying on eco-friendly groups who criticise those same sleek, ergonomic lines on its products. </p> <p>It sounds like something out of a futuristic dystopia. It is also true. Earlier this summer, to representatives of the European Information and Communications Technology Industry Association in Brussels, Andrew Baynes, project manager at Sony International (Europe), made Sony's pitch against eco-activism. Sony's problem with the greenies is this: its products contain toxins and are difficult to dispose of. Environmentalists would like tougher controls. Sony wants to avoid them. </p> <p>Its strategy is outlined in a leaked paper currently doing the rounds of the alternative internet community. Titled 'NGO Strategy', it bears all the Cold War histrionics of J. Edgar Hoover's G-Men. The document discloses the names, contacts and internet addresses of leading environmental groups that pose a public relations threat to the company - the Northern Alliance for Sustainability, Greenpeace, the European Environment Bureau, the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition and Friends of the Earth. </p> <p>The electronics industry, including Sony, has been fighting efforts by environmentalists who would prefer the manufacturers to take responsibility for environmental and health hazards of product disposal. In the EU, these efforts have culminated in the European Commission Directive on Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment - or WEEE. The proposed law would force manufacturers such as Sony to take financial responsibility for managing their products throughout their life cycle, a period that includes disposal. Compulsory targets for collection will be set in 2006 - when between 70 and 90 per cent by weight of all collected equipment must be recycled or re-used. The directive would further propose the phasing out by 2008 of mercury, lead, cadmium and other toxic chemicals commonly used by the electronics industry. </p> <p>The cost to the electronics industry could be astronomical. And since the European legislation surfaced several years ago, the American Electronic Association - an industrial umbrella organisation for more than 3,000 companies, including IBM, Microsoft, Motorola and Intel - has launched a major offensive against extended producer responsibility. The AEA says the legislation contradicts World Trade Organisation code. </p> <p>Sony's presentation makes for sobering reading - after three global demonstrations in the last year, are NGOs still to be characterised as subversive operatives? 'NGO Activity to watch out for!' reads page five - with added links to literature published online by Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. The environmental organisations are further identified as 'highly active' and 'well organised' with a 'global reach'. </p> <p>'Don't wait!!' is the mandate from the Sony report to company personnel. Sony's recommendation is the hiring of corporate press officers as rapid reaction units. And the preparation of industry-wide template responses - as opposed to the dribs and drabs of contradicting information usually associated with press offices. </p> <p>So far, you might think, Sony's is the response indicative of any corporate behemoth facing the prospect of having to take responsibility for its products. But then follows the punch line. The presentation suggests the electronics industry employ 'web investigation agencies' as a solution to pesky online critics. London-based Infonic Plc are the web snoops recommended by Sony. </p> <p>Infonic's website is a defiant call to arms for blue-chip companies besieged by online activists following the swell of protests in Seattle, Washington and, more recently, Prague. 'Suddenly a company's voice is no longer louder than that of its leading critics. Activists, customers, journalists and employees are talking to each other like never before, with big business finding it increasingly difficult to stay in the conversation.' </p> <p>The internet detectives boast few morals in terms of the clients they take on. Infonic first rose to prominence when the company was hired by Shell International to decipher the internet as a barometer for public opinion in the aftermath of Greenpeace's victorious occupation of the Brent Spar oil platform in 1995. Other clients featured on the company website include British Airways, Levis Strauss &amp; Co and Unilever. </p> <p>The use of internet trawlers like Infonic to specifically monitor NGOs sets a precedent in the commercial sector. The monitoring of internet-friendly activists has, in recent years, taken on an alarming momentum. The Big Brother of internet investigation agencies, America's E:Watch, helps more than 800 of the world's largest corporations keep track of their reputations across cyberspace. A watchful eye on the antics of corporate protesters, naturally, is a priority. E:Watch clients include the H. J. Heinz company and Northwest Airlines. 'You'll hear rumours before they start to spread,' assures its website. 'You'll be among the first to find out about negative or inaccurate information - instead of the last.' </p> <p>Commercial companies using internet detectives to snoop around the websites of their detractors? It sounds like an alarming development in the information war. Until now, the activities of protest groups have traditionally been monitored by governmental agencies. Last May, the Paris-based 'Intelligence Newsletter' reported that reserve units from US Army Intelligence were deployed to monitor the 16-18 April protests against the IMF and World Bank in Washington. 'The Pentagon sent around 700 men from the Intelligence and Security Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, to assist the Washington police on 17 April, including specialists in human and signals intelligence,' the report said. </p> <p>According to the newsletter, activist files are being circulated via the Regional Information Sharing System, a networked database used by 5,300 law enforcement agencies in the US, the FBI, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service, US Customs and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The activities of anarchic groups detailed by RISS include findings on Greenpeace, the American Indian Movement and the Zapatista National Liberation Front. </p> <p>Sony's advocacy of Infonic, on the face of it, might not amount to anything more than a smear campaign against the likes of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. But environmental organisations that rely on funding for survival could find themselves crippled in the face of unsubstantiated rumours. 'People on the boards of foundations are very much part of the establishment,' says Iza Kruszewska, spokesperson for the Northern Alliance for Sustainability. 'Big corporations hold a powerful sway over their opinions on funding NGOs.' </p> <p>The nervous shiver that characterises the language employed by the Sony report has been met with mild bemusement by the various environmental organisations named within its pages. California's Silicon Valley Toxic Coalition employs no more than 14 staffers at its San Jose offices. 'There's little need for web investigation agencies,' laughs Ted Smith, its executive director. 'We're hardly a Fortune 500 company. If they want to know anything about us, all Sony has to do is read our website.'</p>",
  "In London three years ago, I ran into a Tory MP and his wife. Given that their party had just lost an historic landslide, both were looking extravagantly happy. Their glee was because the Tories had elected a new leader: 'one of us'. I could scarcely keep a straight face. 'You mean you really think that a Tory Party led by William Hague is going to beat a Labour Party led by Tony Blair?' <p>As the Tories gather at Bournemouth, they are puffed up and boastful, having managed to gain an opinion-poll lead - three years after the election, with the Government limping from a series of self-inflicted wounds. </p> <p>It seems a good moment to say again that Hague is a disastrous leader, and that the Tories under him are almost as unelectable as Labour were 20 years ago, for the same reason: the party has been taken over by dogma and dogmatists, moving further away from the centre, with fatal electoral consequences. What this Opposition should have been doing these past three years is attacking the Government from the Left. </p> <p>That doesn't mean 'taxing and spending', where the competition between the parties is largely shadow-boxing. This Government's real weakness isn't its economic policies, but its horrifying authoritarianism. Tony Blair is a capable politician who can claim real achievements. He is also a man with a quite unusually low conception of truth, justice and individual freedom. </p> <p>We all remember last year's 'forces of conservatism' speech. But the really frightening moment came when he denounced all that stood in his path, using the words 'stupid libertarianism'. Something important and rather horrible happened when the Prime Minister called freedom a 'stupid' idea. </p> <p>Last week an obviously unstable man waving an air rifle was shot dead by our 'unarmed' police, and a woman was imprisoned for seducing 14-year-old boys. The Government adds one repressive measure after another... attacking jury trial, empowering itself to read our emails. On Tuesday, Blair boasted about further assaults on freedom and due process: 'power to impose curfews... without the hassle of endless forms and court bureaucracy... give offenders on drugs a choice: get treatment or lose your liberty.' </p> <p>We need an Opposition to stand up for the rights of the freeborn Englishman. What does Hague do? Backing further into the corner on the Right, he tells us that he favours the death penalty - and we hear that this might even become an election issue. </p> <p>Plenty of people think that socialism is an idea whose time has come and gone, that the market was a better device for the allocation of resources than central planning, that our welfare state is now too sclerotic to work even on its own terms, that scepticism is the proper attitude towards the centralising and undemocratic tendencies of the European Union; who believe all of that, and will never vote for a party which advocates capital punishment. I am one. Flourishing the rope was one example of Hague's demagoguery - and lack of judgment. </p> <p>In his speech on Tuesday, Blair was right to mock Hague's love of jumping on every bandwagon. He showed that again during the fuel blockade. Here was a perfect opportunity for the leader of the Opposition. For the first time in his premiership Blair visibly lost control of events. Hague could have played the statesman, said that he understood the feelings of the people and that no one likes paying taxes, but that we all have to obey the law, that the place to express your views is the ballot box. Instead he said that the blockaders were 'fine, upstanding people'. As a well-judged turn of phrase it matched Hague acclaiming Jeffrey Archer for his 'probity and integrity'. </p> <p>Three years ago I laughed at the idea that William Hague could beat Tony Blair at the next election. I still don't think he will. What's more, he does not deserve to.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Unholy Trinity</strong><br> </p> <p>Trinity Mirror, publisher of the number-two 'red top' and a clutch of regional papers, has had a torrid time of late. The shares seem to be unable to find a floor, despite solid interim results a fortnight ago. </p> <p>At 492p, Trinity is now the cheapest European newspaper stock around. And German-owned broker Commerzbank, for one, thinks the market is distinctly undervaluing the internet potential of Trinity's strong local franchises in particular. </p> <p>Trinity has a far more developed internet strategy than its main rivals. But now it trades at a 20 per cent discount to Johnston Press, when it traditionally stood at a premium. The discount to its average European peer is a whacking 45 per cent. </p> <p>Commerzbank's new sum- of-the-parts valuation of Trinity comes out at 630p, with an additional 30p for the internet assets, giving a target price of 660p. Buy for recovery. </p> <p><strong> Sport wannabe</strong><br> </p> <p>Among the sector's wannabes, Sportsworld Media is carving out a name for itself in sports marketing, TV programming and events management. The shares have soared, leaping sixfold since listing at the end of 1998. </p> <p>Sportsworld makes a range of TV programmes, and following the acquisition of Australian Media Holdings and Sports &amp; Outdoor Media, it is also big Down Under in talent-show programmes and sports stadium advertising. </p> <p>In the past few weeks, the shares have ticked up to 575p on the back of a recommendation from broker Investec Henderson Crosthwaite. However, the shares are still some way off their 12-month high of 695p, and media analyst Mathew Horsman rates them a buy. </p> <p><strong> Wagon's roll</strong><br> </p> <p>Wagon is one of those industrial stocks whose rating fails to reflect moves out of old-fashioned metal-bashing into higher-technology engineering. Or so thinks broker Old Mutual in its latest piece of sector research. </p> <p>Wagon is now Europe's leading supplier of aluminium stretch-form products for vehicles. As such, it is well-positioned to take advantage of the increased use of lighter aluminium body panels to meet tighter environmental legislation. With new laws due in 2003, North America may offer great prospects for Wagon's products. </p> <p>The shutdown at Longbridge to accommodate the Rover 75 will hit Wagon's first half. But Rover is now only its eighth biggest customer and Wagon has some important new model wins. At XXXp, the shares trade at just five times earnings. Buy. </p> <p><strong> Friend in need</strong><br> </p> <p>Wolseley, the plumber's friend and builder's mate, is another undervalued franchise. Final results were stronger than expected, but at 320p, the shares appear to overlook the group's reliability, says broker Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. Instead, the rating now discounts a hard landing not just in the US, but also in the UK and France. </p> <p>As a result, the group is now valued at less than 0.3 times sales, even lower than the 0.34 times at the bottom of the recession in 1992. The 15-year average is 0.55 times, which suggests Wolseley is a sound recovery play. The broker's target price is 385p. </p> <p><strong> All-a-flutter</strong><br> </p> <p>Banks are again all-a-flutter, with Abbey National coming out fighting against renewed merger talk and Bank of Scotland insisting it doesn't need a deal, despite tilting at NatWest last year. </p> <p>In its latest banking tome, broker J. P. Morgan reiterates our buy on Abbey National, at 891p. Barclays (1882p) is the favourite among the clearers while, at Royal Bank of Scotland (1425p), Morgan believes the recent share price rise has been overdone.</p>",
  "<p>Technology can never be a magic wand. The science of Star Trek offers no foundation on which to build a networked society, nor any clue on how to manage the transition of UK business from a manufacturing- to an information-based economy. </p> <p>It is the Prime Minister's wish to make Britain the best place in Europe for e-business. In many commercial respects we have already arrived. However, as a political ambition, this raises much more than a question of simple business evolution, as revealed by the recent launch of the UK Online project, which aims to digitally enfranchise the entire population in two years. </p> <p>As a society, if we are to embrace both the tyranny and promise of the internet, every institution, public and private, will have to face huge challenges for which many are unprepared. Earlier this year, Tony Blair appointed senior civil servant Alex Allan as the UK's first e-envoy. Allan was given the Herculean challenge of bridging the gap between business, government and technology; the greater part of of this involved dragging many public sector agencies from the nineteenth straight into the twentyfirst century. </p> <p>Allan has resigned for personal reasons, and this leaves a question mark over the succession. Should a role as important as this be a Cabinet appointment, a civil service appointment, or an appointment based on merit, experience and ability alone? </p> <p>Several names have already been suggested. Jim Norton, director of e-commerce at the Institute of Directors, narrowly lost to Allan on the first occasion and appears reluctant to include his name again. Norton has said the e-envoy's role is not one job but several and that there 'are only so many hours in the day'. On Thursday he endorsed the surprise candidacy of Richard Barrington, the e-envoy's director of industry, a technology evangelist on secondment from Sun Microsystems and a popular choice for IT companies and publications. </p> <p>Barrington works alongside Anne Steward, director of the CITU, and another strong potential candidate. On secondment from the Australian government, Steward is the author of a review of government IT projects and has played an important part in the design of the UK On-line portal. </p> <p>More likely to be the first choice of the civil service, Steward lacks the soap-box evangelism of Barrington, but between them they have much of the political and technical experience the role requires. </p> <p>If reports are correct, Blair appears to be considering expanding the role of Patricia Hewitt, the small business Minister, to include the office of the e-envoy. Creating a place for an e-Cabinet Minister may not be wise, as a single point of ownership for the collective responsibility of our digital future looks about as attractive as responsibility for the Millennium Dome. </p> <p>Following on from an embattled party conference, a clever choice of e-envoy could be a positive result for the Prime Minister and offer a convenient boost to business and public confidence in the Government's plans for a digital economy - finally wiping away the shadow of the RIP Bill and other contentious e-business-related legislation. </p> <p>The last thing I would advise Blair to consider is another political or civil service appointment to a role that requires its own unique degree of latitude and independence. </p> <p>There is no map to follow in marking out the hazy boundaries of a wired society. The role of e-envoy demands an energetic person, one capable of expressing a collective vision of progress and policy, supported by a management team that can inspire, encourage and facilitate the enormous changes required by both public and private sector initiatives. </p> <p>With the open competition for the post starting in just over a week, and an appointment expected towards the end of next month, it's time the Government demonstrated evidence of thinking 'outside of the box'.</p>",
  "<p>Picture the future frontline of the automobile war. Scene one. You're gridlocked on the M25 for more than an hour. By the time you come off Britain's longest car park you've bought some shares, booked a restaurant and arranged to view a house for sale nearby. As you leave the motorway a voice from the car's onboard computer directs you to the property. </p> <p>Scene two. Your car has overturned. You're unconscious, but the airbag has cushioned the impact, and triggered an alarm system which alerted the emergency services. The ambulance will find you, because the car has a global positioning system. </p> <p>Scene three. The petrol tank is low. A display beamed on to your rear-view mirror shows you the nearest petrol station which is offering you a free car wash. </p> <p>Scene four. Although you don't know it, a car accident 15 miles ahead means you are heading for long delays. A screen built into your dashboard plots an alternative route. Meanwhile, your engine's computer diagnostics system uses the internet to book the car in for a check-up at your local garage </p> <p>Fanciful? Maybe now, but not in five years' time. Telematics - providing information and services to cars using telecommunications - is new in Britain now, but it is set to be the Next Big Thing. It is already being talked about in the hushed tones analysts used to describe e-commerce five years ago. </p> <p>The predictions made for the exponential growth rate of telematics business are astounding. One of the biggest players in the market, US-based firm Delphi, suggests that half of all new cars could have telematic devices fitted as standard by 2005. </p> <p>The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that more than 4 million cars sold in Western Europe in 2005 will have onboard navigation systems. And analysts at Deutsche Bank predicts that the telematics market will grow from $1 billion in 1998 to $42bn in 2010. </p> <p>Turning cars into mobile super computers is driven by forecasts of unprecedented congestion. Telematics help drivers find ways around the jams or, failing that, connects them to the wired world so that while stuck in traffic, they can communicate as efficiently as if they were at home or in the office. After all, some people practically live in their cars already. US consumers spend a whopping 500 million hours a week in their vehicles. In Europe, between 50 and 70 per cent of all mobile phone minutes are accounted for by drivers. </p> <p>Apart from cutting journey times, telematics' proponents argue that it reduces anxiety. 'When drivers know the nature and extent of a problem, they get less stressed about it,' said Bill McIntosh, financial director at Traffic-master, the UK company rolling out a pan-European vehicle navigation system. </p> <p>The firm's roadside sensors monitor the state of traffic. The information is processed and sent to drivers, via either mobile phones or devices built into cars. Trafficmaster users can also opt to pay for a tracking system that monitors vehicles' whereabouts - handy for, say, haulage firms worried about thefts. </p> <p>But it is not just technically savvy companies such as Trafficmaster which are excited about telematics. The big motor manufacturers, are disciples too, hoping that sales of this hi-tech kit will improve their tight margins. </p> <p>General Motors is attempting to dominate the market with its OnStar system. Originally available only on GM luxury models, OnStar has been developed from a navigation and emergency response system to embrace other multimedia functions, such as video and email. </p> <p>Significantly, GM is offering other carmakers the chance to fit OnStar, which suggests the firm will soon look to float off this business. </p> <p>Analysts at Deutsche Bank predicted last May that OnStar could generate revenues of $4bn by 2005. </p> <p>Meanwhile, rival Ford's Connect telematics system could be worth $3.2bn in five years. Earlier this year Ford unveiled prototype cars called 24-7s. These all have integrated telematic systems which, apart from turning vehicles into something like Kit, the camp-sounding onboard computer featured in the TV series Knight Rider, allow you to 'personalise' your car interior using a voice activation system. Want a pink dashboard? Just tell the car that's the mood you're in. </p> <p>The Economist Intelligence Unit says around 20 per cent of the value of an executive's car is based on its electronics systems. By 2005 this will reach 30 per cent. </p> <p>In addition, motor manufacturers know that by developing telematics systems they can can cut content deals with information providers and generate subscription revenues, so easing the cyclical nature of their industry. Ford already has a deal with AOL, while GM has Yahoo! on its side. </p> <p>But will the likes of Ford and GM be able dominate the telematics industry in the long run? McIntosh said: 'The debate will be about who controls the customers. It will be interesting to see whether it is the car manufacturers or the telecoms companies. It's difficult to see how that works out, because the two sectors' planning cycles are very different, and putting anything into a car takes up to five years.' </p> <p>So far the car industry as a whole has been extremely slow in cornering the market. Only 2 per cent of car phones are fitted by the manufacturer; the rest are fitted later. </p> <p>Big mobile phone firms are on the prowl. Vodafone, for instance, has a dedicated telematics arm, and is planning to launch its own vehicle tracking service. The mobile phone giant is talking to a number of carmakers about supplying onboard telematic systems as standard, although it declines to comment on specifics. </p> <p>But the danger is that drivers could soon have too much information. 'The industry needs to be focused,' McIntosh said. 'All this infotainment such as \"where's the nearest hotel, petrol station or golf course\" - where do you draw the line? Clearly, there is an issue of driver overload. There's only a certain amount of information that they can efficiently handle. Safety analysts are now starting to look at telematics.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, telematics is ripe for growth. The words 'information superhighway' have just taken on a whole new meaning.</p>",
  "<p>It is the biggest competition inquiry ever mounted in Britain. Commissioned by the Labour government in April last year, the subject was unashamedly populist. </p> <p>In 'Rip-Off Britain', supermarket giants stood accused of milking customers and suppliers to line their own pockets. Not only were we paying more for our food than foreigners, it was claimed, big retailers were also profiting from farmers' misfortune, and bleeding our town centres dry. </p> <p>The results of the Competition Commission's 16-month inquiry, yet to be published, run to thousands of pages. It has generated one of the biggest paper mountains Whitehall has seen: 400 submissions, over 1,500 detailed responses and the results of 50 individual hearings around the country. </p> <p>A dozen of those hearings took place with the country's 'big five' chains - Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Safeway and Morrison's - which mounted a fierce rearguard attack to blunt the report's findings. Their lobbying may yet mean they get off pretty much scot-free. </p> <p>In the report, a copy of which has been obtained by The Observer, the Commission finds the big five guilty of harming smaller grocers and restricting the choice of vulnerable consumers - such as the disabled, people on low incomes and the elderly with no cars - by flogging staples such as bread and milk at rock-bottom prices. </p> <p>'The selling on a persistent basis, by Asda, Morrison's, Safeway, Sainsbury and Tesco, of certain frequently purchased products either below cost (that is at a negative gross margin) or at retail prices that do not cover all direct costs, operates against the public interest,' it says. </p> <p>Customers in the South East, East Anglia and West Midlands, in particular, also pay more for their shopping: three of the chains use their power to set different prices across the country. Tesco's prices varied by as much as 9 per cent, the report finds. </p> <p>'The setting by Safeway, Sainsbury and Tesco of retail prices across different stores in different geographical areas in the light of local competitive conditions, such variation not being related to costs, operates against the public interest,' it says. </p> <p>But on each count, the Commission concludes that it is powerless to stop them. In France and Ireland, for instance, prohibition of predatory pricing has just not worked. Forcing a national pricing policy on firms is un workable. Displaying thousands of prices on the internet would be too onerous. </p> <p>In some areas, the giants have massive market shares: over 50 per cent for Tesco in Uxbridge, Milton Keynes, Cambridge, Twickenham and Salisbury. The same goes for Sainsbury in south-west London and for Safeway in Dumfries. Yet the 'nuclear option' for tackling regional monopolies - the forced sale of stores - is firmly ruled out. </p> <p>Of course, Stephen Byers, the Trade and Industry Secretary, can overrule the commissioners. But even on its one big recommendation, the report anticipates trouble. Forcing the big five, in areas where they are already strong, to obtain Office of Fair Trading approval for big new stores of over 1,000 sq metres would help safeguard competition, it says. But fresh legislation is likely to be needed for the DTI to act. </p> <p>'As this recommendation does not follow from adverse findings on either of the complex monopoly situations that we identified, nor from facts found during the course of our enquiry, we recognise that it cannot form the basis of enforceable action by the Secretary of State,' the Commission says. </p> <p>For supermarket suppliers, however, the news is better. Following many complaints, the Commission identified 52 different types of practice where the big chains have used their power to turn the screw on suppliers. In 'a climate of fear', however, none is prepared to be named in case it is blacklisted. </p> <p>Many of the practices - from charging for shelf space, to coercing discounts and restricting dealings with other retailers - distort competition and operate against the public interest, the report concludes. </p> <p>On this score, the industry has already moved to head off criticism. Following farmers' protests, six chains are now in talks with the National Farmers' Union and the Ministry of Agriculture over a voluntary code of practice. </p> <p>The report sets out 10 provisions such a code should take in, including a ban on any form of shelf-space payment, interference with the supplier's other business activities and unfair alterations to supply contracts. Controversially, however, it stops short of advocating tough new laws. Instead, it proposes that the code should have OFT approval and provide for resolution of disputes by an 'independent party'. </p> <p>'We hope all the major buyers will participate in drawing up the code, but whether or not they do so, they should be required to comply with it,' the Commission says. </p> <p>The conclusions are likely to irk small farmers in particular. On the main charge of screwing the farmer but keeping checkout prices high, the chains are largely exonerated. The real price of food, indeed, has fallen 9.4 per cent over the past decade. Nor, the report concludes, is the industry making excess profits. The pressure recently has been downwards. </p> <p>It will be music to the industry's ears that the Commission's own customer survey indicates a 'high degree of satisfaction' from shoppers. And Rip-Off Britain is not quite what we imagined. 'Our international price comparison showed that, even though UK prices are higher than those in France, Germany and Holland, the difference can be fully explained by exchange rates, perceived quality differences in own-label products and higher UK land costs,' the report says. </p> <p>This weekend, the industry may breathe a sigh of relief. But the chains will be red-faced at many further revelations about controversial practices. Despite the supermarkets' denials, for instance, the report finds Tesco, Sainsbury and Safeway are less likely to drop their prices when competing with each other locally than other big stores. </p> <p>The Commission clears the chains of wildly profiteering on own brands. But, on average, they hold back a third of the cost savings to boost mar gins. The only chain to pass on the whole saving was Morrison's. At the opposite extreme, though, Safeway keeps two-thirds for itself, the Commission finds. </p> <p>The report investigated 24 chains in all, each having 10 or more supermarkets of over 600 sq metres. As well as the big five, the list included Somerfield, Waitrose, Marks &amp; Spencer, Budgen, Iceland, family-owned Booths in the north-west, the three foreign 'hard discounters' - Aldi, Lidl and Netto - and 10 Co-ops. </p> <p>Of total large supermarket sales of \u00a352 billion a year, the big five have a 75.6 per cent market share. The rest of the sector is by no means whiter than white, especially in treatment of suppliers, the report finds. But, as far as consumers are concerned, the Commission concludes their local influence is too small to harm the public interest. </p> <p>Of the big five, only Asda and Morrison's have a uniform national pricing policy, as do Waitrose, Iceland, Aldi and Lidl among the rest. Only M&amp;S and Lidl were identified as never selling below cost. </p> <p>'We recognise it is unusual, although not unprecedented, for the Commission to recommend no remedy for identified adverse effects. However, we consider that this is appropriate in the light of our overall finding that the market is generally competitive,' the report concludes, leaving the politicians to sort out the inevitable row.</p>",
  "<p>Our house caught fire on Christmas Day 1998 and the whole of upstairs and roof were burnt. Our insurer, Hiscox, sent in the builders, who made an awful mess of every job. </p> <p>We have had some of the work put right, but now everything has stopped and it seems the insurance company is at odds with the loss adjusters. They admit the work has to be done but how long must we wait? </p> <p>We are both 75 and it has been a rotten experience.<br><strong>FR, Warrington</strong> </p> <p>Hiscox agrees that the work done was not up to standard. When you first complained, it insisted that a director of the loss adjuster's firm visit your house to check the junior employee's recommendations. Saying that you did not need to move into a hotel while your home was restored was particularly harsh. Rebuilding started and eventually the insurer paid the contractor in full, even though the final work had not been done. </p> <p>Hiscox has now agreed to pay whatever is needed to rectify the faults. A new surveyor estimated this at \u00a34,000 although you reckon there is still about \u00a36,000 of work to be done. Hiscox has agreed with you to settle at \u00a35,000. At your request, it is sending a cheque so you can choose your own builder. </p> <p><strong> Computer problems</strong></p> <p>On 5 July, I sent a cheque for \u00a31,623 to First National Tricity Finance in full settlement for a computer I had bought from Time Computers, to meet the deadline of 12 July. </p> <p>On my return from holiday on 26 July, my bank statement showed that the cheque had not been put through and the first monthly credit instalment of \u00a370.69 had been deducted. </p> <p>First National denied receiving payment. Since I could not prove the envelope was not lost in the post, I sent another cheque. Ten days later, I discovered that they had found the original cheque as well as the second so I had to pay the bank to stop one of the cheques. They deducted a further instalment in August.<br><strong>RH, Leeds</strong> </p> <p>Abbey National, which owns First National, admits that you have had poor service. Your first cheque was 'temporarily mislaid' so the computer started charging you interest automatically. As Money Writes readers know, there have been other complaints about First National failing to accept payment in full settlement of an interest-free credit agreement. </p> <p>When you sent the second cheque, customer service staff should have manually intervened to stop further deductions from your bank account. The bank has now sent you a cheque for the two payments wrongly deducted, with \u00a350 compensation for out-of-pocket expenses. </p> <p><strong> Fair shares for trustees</strong></p> <p>In 1997, when my son was born, I opened a Kidzone savings account with Bradford &amp; Bingley held in trust in my name. I was surprised to be told in March that, as a trustee account holder, I did not qualify for the share distribution, but was not fussed until I read in Cash that I should receive shares. </p> <p>I contacted Bradford &amp; Bingley, who sent the transfer document. But this, if I understand it correctly, says that we would be entitled to a share distribution only if I had a separate account or my son was disabled. I find this most bizarre. <br><strong>AL, London</strong> </p> <p>Earlier this year, Bradford &amp; Bingley had to identify the accounts owned by people unable to look after their own money and held by carers, called trustees on the accounts. It wrote to all customers and confused many parents holding children's accounts because they too are trustees. </p> <p>Children with accounts held in trust can get a share handout if they meet all the eligibility requirements: at least \u00a3100 in the account on 25 April 1999, 21 May 2000 and 3 December 2000; and no change to the names on the account. The society is finalising details towards the end of this month. </p> <p><strong> Careful driver pays penalty</strong></p> <p>My 35-year-old daughter, a careful driver, had accumulated a nine-year no claims bonus with her insurer, NIG Skandia. In February her car was broken into and she claimed on her comprehensive policy. </p> <p>This was her only claim, yet her discount has been reduced from nine years to three, thereby more than doubling her previous year's premium. Where is the logic in that?<br><strong>PM, Leicester </strong> </p> <p>Although the damage was not her fault, the insurance company penalised her because, obviously, it could not reclaim the repair cost. </p> <p>As she had no protected no claims discount, her bonus dropped by six years, from 65 per cent to 38 per cent. But this is not the only reason why her premiums increased so much. </p> <p>Last year, NIG Skandia withdrew the policy she had and substituted a more expensive one. This cost \u00a3329 but, to soften the blow in year one, NIG charged only \u00a3219. This year she had to suffer the full impact which, with a smaller no- claims discount, was \u00a3427. </p> <p><strong> Paying tax as a non-resident</strong></p> <p>As an English non-resident living in Brazil, I have UK income tax deducted every month from my pension.

  "<p>As a child Robert Opie collected things. The usual stuff: stamps, coins, matchbox cars. But at 16 his acquisitive attention turned to something a bit different - contemporary packaging. </p> <p>'It seemed both weird and sane,' says Opie. 'I had absolutely no money and there I was in 1968 spend ing one-and-sixpence on various tubes of toothpaste that I was never going to use.' </p> <p>To-day his collection stretches back to Victorian times; it is featured in books, exhibitions and is the basis for two museums. It's fair to say his modest, if strange, investments have paid off. </p> <p>But is this the case for most collecting fanatics? Can their particular and pec-uliar hoards really gain in value, or would they fail to attract interest even at a village bring-and-buy? 'If there is a genuine collectors' market out there, with an international audience, they can make a profit,' says Tim Wonnacott, chairman of Sotheby's South. </p> <p>Gwyn Jones, managing editor of Collect it! magazine, agrees, pointing out that one man's trash can indeed be another's treasure. 'People collect everything and it is possible to make money on it all - carrier bags, sick bags, bottle tops, washing machines, coat hangers, barbed wire, bricks.' </p> <p>Even bits of medieval royals can attract a high price these days. Bonham's sold a snip of Edward IV's beard for \u00a3500 this year, and a lock of Charles I's hair went for more than \u00a34,000. </p> <p>But like most investments there are simple rules to keep in mind. And it helps if you are lucky, too. </p> <p>Greg Vandike is a case in point. He grew up surrounded by music. His parents were in the business and, as a boy, he saw the Rolling Stones and the Beatles; he got to meet the likes of David Bowie and Pink Floyd. 'Sometimes they'd give me things or just sign things and I'd keep it all,' says Vandike, who went on to become a band promoter, organising gigs for artists such as the Sex Pistols. </p> <p>He kept any left-over sou venirs. 'Spare posters, programmes, tickets, you name it.' Storage was always a problem; the garage was regularly cleared out. 'I must have burned at least three-quarters of everything.' </p> <p>What remained, Vandike later realised, was a 'little goldmine'. One album alone could now fetch \u00a35,000. In addition to being an avid collector, Vandike is now an ob-sessive dealer - he claims to be one of the world's most respected dealers in rare records from the Fifties, Sixties and Seventies. 'Not bad for someone who just happened to be in the right place at the right time,' he says. </p> <p>But an ad hoc approach does not always pay dividends. Sometimes what is required is good old fashioned meticulousness. Enter Ronnie Roter. Twenty-five years ago he decided to become an expert in his chosen subject - Gone With The Wind . 'I am now the UK's foremost authority on the film. I am by far the leading collector outside America.' </p> <p>Roter owns thousands of pieces, from signed books to bound manuscripts estimated to be worth $20,000 each. Then there is a letter written by Clark Gable that Roter bought from an elderly American. 'It's probably worth \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000,' he says. 'Prices really have shot up astronomically; what I own is worth a lot of money - at least \u00a3200,000.' </p> <p>Yet not all collections, no matter how comprehensive or obscure, gain in value. Alexander Crum Ewing, director of collections at Bonhams, explains further. 'We once had a lady ring us up with 2,000 Smurfs. The most they would fetch is \u00a31 each, but moving them as a lot would be very difficult. We said the best she could do was buy herself a woolly scarf, block out several Sundays and set herself up at a car boot sale.' </p> <p>So what makes a good in-vestment and what makes a dud? Hugh Scully, presenter of the Antiques Road Show and valuer for online auctioneer QXL.com, provides a simple answer. 'Value is governed by quality, rarity, fashion and nostalgia.' </p> <p>Here's how to get the mix right. First, do your research. 'Know what you should be buying and what you should be paying,' says Jones of Collect it! Next, make sure the area you are collecting has potential - either it is a steady bet, a good outsider or a complete long shot where you try to predict what will be the next big thing. The latter, says Jones, is a real risk, 'but that's the fun of the gamble'. </p> <p>When you do start to buy, go for what you like. 'Choose what excites you, what in-spires you, what tempts you,' says Wonnacott of Sotheby's. </p> <p>And always get the best quality you can afford in the best condition you can find. 'You're much better off with one perfect, decent piece than five tired, mediocre pieces,' says Crum Ewing. </p> <p>Once your collection starts to build, get it properly valued and fully insured. 'Do this sooner rather than later,' advises David Hoyles, insurance manager for Age Concern Enterprises. </p> <p>If you do put a piece on the market, check out where it will sell best - with a dealer, at an auction, or on the internet. Seek advice from the relevant collector group. </p> <p>Also bear in mind any financial implications of the sale. If you make more than \u00a37,200, you'll face capital gains tax. If you trade a lot, the Inland Revenue may deem you to be earning an income and tax you accordingly. 'This is very open to interpretation,' says Jon Briggs, associate director of Chart-well Asset Management. 'Timing is important.' </p> <p>More and more people are getting into collecting. The market is worth \u00a3650 million a year according to Business Intelligence Service, which says the average spend has increased 11 per cent. This begs the question of what that money is being spent on, and which markets will be hot in the future. </p> <p>'If I knew the answer to that, I would now be on a very large yacht in the south of France sipping a nice cool Sancerre,' says Scully. 'But I can give a few hints. Look out for things that are of today, that reflect the end of the twentieth century and the dawn of a new millennium.' </p> <p>But even if a collector does get it right, they are usually loth to sell their treasures anyway, regardless of how much they can make. 'Collectors are passionate people and I know of no case where someone has willingly parted with a collection,' says Scully. 'To many it would be worse than divorce.' </p> <p>Wonnacott agrees. 'It's never about the financial gain; it's always about the pleasure involved. It is something deeply ingrained in us. Maybe it goes back to our hunter-gatherer instinct. We feel a compulsion to go out and find things that bring us joy and happiness and comfort. Things that we can bring back into our inner space - our haven. </p> <p>'And once they are in place, there is no way you will want to part with them, whether they are worth 50p or much more.'</p>",
  "<p>Don't hold your breath for it - but the UK is tomorrow embarking on a path that is likely to produce stronger rights for couples who live together rather than getting married. </p> <p>The Human Rights Act, which comes into force tomorrow, enshrines a set of rights that all citizens will be entitled to. These include the rights to liberty and security, respect for private and family life and 'an effective remedy'. No one really knows how UK judges will interpret the new law - because a rights-based approach is new to the UK - but there is some consensus that cohabitees will gradually see their rights strengthened. </p> <p>Since the Act specifically rules out discrimination against individuals on the ground of their sexual orientation, gay people are likely to acquire rights over the long term which would put them on a par with heterosexual couples - who can get married. Law firm Belmont Hodgson, which specialises in gay issues, is planning to challenge the Inheritance Tax situation - under which gay couples miss out on the more favourable tax treatment for husbands and wives. </p> <p>If a wife dies, for instance, there is no IHT on any gifts or assets of hers which she passes to her husband. If, however, a woman living with another woman dies, the partner is liable for IHT on those assets if the estate is bigger than the current IHT threshold of \u00a3234,000 and if the other IHT exemptions are used up. </p> <p>Belmont Hodgson's case concerns two men who lived together in a committed relationship for 30 years. Partner Andrew Belmont is in correspondence with the Inland Revenue but says: 'We expect the case to be fully contested.' </p> <p>The Revenue has said it will continue to interpret the law as it does at the moment - giving IHT relief only to married couples - unless it is explicitly informed that the law has changed, either in a court case or via new tax legislation. </p> <p>The difficulty about mounting this sort of challenge under the Human Rights Act is the cost. Since government bodies such as the Inland Revenue may decide to fight these issues all the way, any legal challenge could be very expensive. The Act is based on the European Convention on Human Rights and represents a fundamental change in the way UK law works. </p> <p>Instead of protecting rights by coming to very specific conclusions through court hearings (the way that case law works in this country), the Act states the broad rights to which all citizens are entitled. It could be said that tomorrow marks the biggest change of approach since Henry II laid down the makings of the modern legal system back in the 1150s. </p> <p>Mediation and family law expert Alastair Logan of the Logan Partnership in Guildford believes that the 'right to respect for private and family life' could see legal changes to improve the lot of unmarried cohabitees and their children. 'Children have a right to a family life. Does it matter to a child if its mummy and daddy are married or not? I don't think so. But are you discriminating against that child if they are then treated differently? I can see that there will be a lot of pressure in this area.' </p> <p>At the moment, a mother can win maintenance payments for herself from her ex-partner only if she was married to him. It could be argued that a child she now looks after is disadvantaged and discriminated against if there is less money entering the household because the parents never tied the knot. </p> <p>But many of the challenges brought under the new law are likely to be rather complicated in this way. It is possible, for instance, that a case for a more generous Legal Aid system could be made under the 'right to an effective remedy' which states that 'everyone... shall have an effective remedy before a national authority...' An imaginative judge might say that the current remedies are ineffective since people cannot afford to go to law. A more traditional approach would be to say that the remedy is available, and it is up to individuals how they sort out paying for such a remedy. </p> <p>Some bodies have been long prepared for tomorrow's changes. The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), for instance, is preparing for a slight increase in the number of people asking for a hearing in front of a tribunal, under the rights now outlined to fair trials. </p> <p>At the moment, the different ombudsmen who work in the FOS office try to keep such hearings to a mini mum, so that cases can be dealt with quickly, easily and fairly informally. </p> <p>The senior ombudsman, Walter Merricks, says: 'We're not going to go overboard on it - but from 2 October people will be entitled to ask for a hearing.' </p> <p>In theory, the Act applies only to public bodies - so, for instance, that a worker in the private sector would have less chance of asserting their right to privacy against an employer than a local government officer, a teacher in a state school or a soldier. </p> <p>This issue could well come to a head if employees are sacked when bosses monitor their emails and find something they do not like. Linda Parry, of solicitor Keoghs in Bolton, believes that the law could be made to stretch to the private sector if employment tribunals (themselves public bodies) feel they have to apply the Human Rights Act to all people who appear before them. </p> <p>It is difficult to imagine that tribunal chairs would wish to develop different rulings for private and public sector workers. The bigger problem, in practice, could be the issue of remedies that tribunals could give out. </p> <p>'There is no automatic right to compensation,' says Parry. While a tribunal could give an award for damages, if it thought someone had been unfairly dismissed, it may be inclined to seek a non-financial solution, such as reinstatement of the employee. </p> <p>The crucial issue is how judges interpret the law. It may be that it takes another 10 years before a more modern set of men and women occupy the judges' seats.</p> <p><strong>The case for 'civil partnerships' </strong></p> <p>The part of last month's Liberal Democratic Party conference which most annoyed the Daily Telegraph was the proposal for 'civil partnerships'. Some commentators have started calling it a plan for 'gay marriage' - but that is not an accurate description. </p> <p>Under the Lib Dem plan - put forward to coincide with the Human Rights Act - both heterosexual and gay couples could ask to have their partnership registered in a half-way house between cohabitation and marriage.</p> <p>'Although the Liberal Democrats have not said it as such, I would expect that the new rights would be a bit less than you would get in marriage,' says family law expert Mark Harper of law firm Withers. 'Maybe the rules on maintenance would be different. It may be that the new law would say that the people cohabiting would be expected to be self-supporting if they split up.' After marriage, however, a dependent spouse can apply for maintenance from the other partner.</p> <p>The Lib Dem proposals do say that the civil partnership would cover prop erty, inheritance and pensions issues (as well as maintenance - although, as Harper says, this could be watered down if there are no children involved).</p> <p>While the Law Society, the solicitors' body, has called for a wide-ranging cohabitation law which would cover people living together, the Lib Dem plan would require people to opt into it. Hilary Siddle of law firm Holden &amp; Wilsons in Lancaster has been heavily involved in the Law Society campaign. 'Reform of the law could stop a lot of litigation over things written on the back of a fag packet,' she says. The offices of family lawyers are full of impoverished ex-partners who realise too late that the law gives them little help if they want a share of their ex-partner's wealth. A wife could win the marital home in a settlement, while a cohabitee may end up with nothing.</p> <p>But when the Law Society published its cohabitation proposals last year, it felt politicians would not welcome such a controversial change. Siddle says: 'When the Government has decided that it won't introduce no-fault divorce, it certainly won't take on board changes that take non-marital relationships under the state umbrella.'</p>",
  "<p>Savers with Tessa accounts should check the rates they are being paid. They may be entitled to compensation if they have been earning less than on a comparable account with the same bank or building society, or if their money has been locked in by penalties. </p> <p>A ruling was issued by the Financial Ombudsman Ser vice last week on how banks and societies should treat Tessa savers after a flood of complaints about poor rates on the now obsolete ac-counts. Several organisations are likely to have been in breach of the guidance laid down by the Ombudsman, and some savers might have been short-changed by more than \u00a3150. </p> <p>But some banks and building societies seemed in no mood last week to simply top up and backdate Tessa rates. </p> <p>It looks likely that savers will have to do the leg-work themselves and lodge a formal complaint with their bank or society. If it does not offer a solution that suits them, he or she can appeal to the Ombudsman. </p> <p>The nub of this row is that many banks and building societies have been paying less on Tessa accounts than on Isas, the Government-backed tax-free savings scheme that replaced the Tessa in April 1999. Savers have become unhappy, particularly since they were often unable to transfer their Tessas to another organisation because of penalties. </p> <p>The Ombudsman said he would probably not order compensation if the provider passed at least one of two tests: \u0095It paid a 'fair' rate of interest on the Tessa. 'Fair' means that it was at least as good as that paid on any other account with less onerous features in the bank or society's range. The account would not necessarily be an Isa, therefore. </p> <p>\u0095 It told investors by 5 May 1999 that the Tessa could be moved freely. The Ombudsman ruled that savers should have been told within 30 days of the scrapping of Tessas, on 5 April 1999, that they were 'superseded' accounts. Savers should have been able to move without penalty after that time. </p> <p>The Ombudsman says that in cases where compensation is appropriate he would order the bank or building society to pay the difference between the Tessa rate and the comparable account up to the date the investor was told the account could be transferred without penalty. </p> <p>Britannia building society is paying 6.4 per cent on most of its Tessas against 6.85 per cent on its mini cash Isas. Until July it imposed penalties of 90 days' notice on savers who wanted to move their money. But Britannia believes it does not need to do more to comply with the Ombudsman's ruling. A spokeswoman said: 'We feel the Ombudsman is messing in an area where he shouldn't be.' </p> <p>Abbey National pays 5.95 per cent on a variable rate Tessa, while its Isas pay between 5.95 and 6.65 per cent. Abbey told customers in February 1999 that the Tessa would soon be superseded but it did not remove the \u00a330 administration fee for transfers until August. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Janet Connor, director of savings, says the bank stands by its rate and believes Tessa custom-ers have been given a fair deal. The Tessa's rate has compared well with the base rate over the period. </p> <p>Others look to have a clearer position to defend. </p> <p>Bristol &amp; West said it did not expect to have to fend off complaints. B&amp;W's Tessa carried a penalty until April this year, but the bank had reviewed rates on the variable Tessa and, when its maturity bonuses were taken into account, these had been equivalent to those on the bank's Isa and others comparable accounts. The Ombdusman says that bonuses can be counted towards the overall rate on a Tessa, when comparing it with other accounts. </p> <p>Halifax looks to be in the clear. </p> <p>Its Isa Saver account, paying between 4.15 and 6.6 per cent, has a seven-day notice penalty for withdrawals; the Tessa account pays 6.05 per cent, but there are no penalties. So the terms on the Isa are more onerous than on the Tessa, rather than the reverse - one of the issues the Ombudsman has highlighted. </p> <p>Customers of other organisations may have some difficulty working out whether they have received a fair deal. Several organisations have now equalised Isa and Tessa rates, but rates may have been out of line before this. </p> <p>Another complication is that the Isa rate is not necessarily the one to compare with a Tessa, given that the Ombudsman says the Tessa rate must be as good as any other account with less onerous features. However, the Ombudsman's office says a comparison with Isa rates would be a reasonable starting point. </p> <p>Savers must complain first to the bank or society; if no resolution is reached, they can contact the Ombudsman on 020 7931 0044 (societies) or 0845 766 0902 (banks).</p>",
  "<p>There are management consultants in the US who advise the owners of nursing and residential homes on how they can make their residents more dependent. In that great free market, the entrepreneurs who run old people's homes know that they will make more money from people who have greater physical needs and who are too frail to shop around for help elsewhere. </p> <p>The Alzheimer's Society is concerned that a similar sit uation could develop here. The Government's plans to refocus the funding of long-term care will give a clear incentive to homeowners to provide nursing care whenever they can. </p> <p>Under the proposals announced in July and likely to be debated in parliament this year, people going into homes will find that their nursing costs are paid for by the state. However, they will still have to fund their own 'personal care costs'. The owners of most nursing homes peg their fees in relation to the level of government funding available. At the very least, most will automatically raise their fees to absorb the extra funding available. At the worst, some will find ways of making their clients more dependent. This is not as far-fetched as it might sound. There is already considerable evidence to show that home residents are systematically over-drugged and in a state of chemically induced dependency. </p> <p>The Government is soon to receive a huge blast from charities representing the elderly. A letter from a consortium of groups, including Help the Aged and the Alzheimer's Society, is to be sent to all MPs by the middle of this month, expressing their 'profound disappointment' over the plans. </p> <p>Moves to overhaul the present system of long-term care were started in 1997 when the Labour Government announced the creation of the Royal Commission on Long-Term Care for the Elderly. This reported last year, urging that all nursing and personal care costs be met by the Government. The Government was understandably wary of the costs involved. It decided to go for a much cheaper option, funding the nursing care element, which it announced in July this year. (Personal care costs would still be funded if the elderly people involved could not meet the bill themselves - but many people would still be forced to sell their homes and use up all their pensions on homes' fees.) </p> <p>The big problem with the proposals is the narrow definition of nursing care. Under the plans, someone with Alzheimer's would get very little financial assistance. Helping someone get dressed is defined as personal care, as is helping them eat their food or go to the toilet. Nursing care is something done by a registered nurse. As the law stands, there need be only one nurse on duty in a nursing home at any one time. Nursing care will largely be restricted to medical duties such as dispensing drugs. </p> <p>The charities are also angry that the Government has done little to encourage healthy living and prevent dependency. 'We are profoundly disappointed with the proposed Government solution,' says Mervyn Kohler of Help the Aged. 'It has missed the opportunity to do anything of any value whatsoever.' </p> <p>Prevention has been very low down the list of Government priorities - though it is enormously cost-effective. Older people who keep themselves fit have a far higher chance of having a longer and healthier old age. </p> <p>The tiny charity Research into Ageing has just commissioned research into reducing the effect of falls. Hardly a glamorous subject, the study of falls has huge implications for both individual and state. </p> <p>One in three women over 65 and one in five men have a fall each year. About 20 per cent of these falls lead to injury or fracture. The majority of admissions into hospital in this age group, and 40 per cent of nursing home admissions, are due to falls. Fractures, which are mainly due to falls, cost the National Health Service \u00a3940 million each year. </p> <p>Research into Ageing is now working on a short physical education programme which appears to cut the chances of falling by 50 per cent by, for instance, strengthening ankles, the lower leg and the physical confidence of pensioners. National programmes of this sort would have a negligible cost to the state. To the individual it might mean a weekly visit to a gentle aerobics class. But the costs saved could be enormous. </p> <p> Similarly, early diagnosis can prevent people from losing their sight or developing osteoporosis, conditions that frequently send the sufferers straight into nursing or residential homes at a huge personal and financial cost. For instance, it is now possible to get a bone density test for \u00a310 - an examination which, if you take it at 50 or 60, can steer you away from osteoporosis and give you several extra years of independence in your 80s or 90s. </p> <p>The charities are all concerned that a major legislative change on long-term care is likely to come only once in a generation. The system adopted in parliament in the next year could still be in place in 20 or 30 years. </p> <p>The Alzheimer's Society has launched a letter-writing campaign to encourage its members to write to their MPs, registering their demand for a more imaginative, equitable approach to long-term care. </p> <p>Even the Government's most direct attempt to help the estimated 40,000 peo ple a year who sell their houses to pay for long-term care is being criticised as financially unsound for individuals. Someone in this position could take a loan from their local authority to postpone the sale of their home until after they died - but interest would build up on the fees they owed. </p> <p>But if they went this route, they would lose any entitlement they might have to Attendance Allowance, worth \u00a353.55 a week. </p> <p>The Nursing Home Fees Agency, an independent financial adviser, calculates that they would be out of pocket by an average of \u00a343,000 after five years.</p>",

She is Japanese and they were both learning German. They are now married and have a son and daughter, Sean and Kennedy, aged two and four, but John has the urge to travel. </p> <p>During the day he works from the Royal Free Hospi tal, for a charity that arranges transport for patients. He is also studying for a BA in English. When he graduates next year, he will take a TEFL course and wants to teach English abroad for a year or two. </p> <p>'By that time I will be 35 and the older you get, the less chance you have of getting a job, particularly in a place like Japan where they only want younger teachers.' He has not yet decided where he will go. 'Perhaps Switzerland, Thailand or Japan. I only like big cities.' </p> <p>Wherever it is, Atsuko will stay in London with the children. She is resident in the UK but has never worked in this country and has no National Insurance number. </p> <p>John's hobby is dealing in shares. 'I am interested in gadgets, so in the technology boom I bought into a few companies that I knew about. When interest rates and inflation are low, I would not bother putting money in the bank. If you put it in the stock market, you may halve it or you may double it, but at least you have excitement along the way.' </p> <p>He was successful until the downturn in the dotcom market, which turned \u00a330,000 of shares into \u00a325,000. He tries to cash in when he makes profits but knows that he does not always sell unprofitable shares soon enough. He does not have a sharedealing budget. He says: 'If my wife was working, I would have more disposable income and would deal more.' </p> <p>At the moment he pays \u00a3220 a month in rent and is happy to sell the shares to buy a house. </p> <p>'I would miss the stock market because I really enjoy it. But bricks and mortar is one of the most profitable and reliable things you can invest in, and you have the security of a house.' </p> <p>He has around 30 building society accounts, some dormant and some paying economic rates. 'I am not totally in favour of carpet-bagging but you don't want to be the mug who is left behind.' </p> <p>He wants to know if he can have a stakeholder pension while he is working abroad and whether he should open one for Atsuko. </p> <p>He thought he had plenty of life insurance but it turns out to be only the small element that comes with savings policies and free accidental death insurance from the bank.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Danielle Leich</strong></p> <p>Someone who is UK domiciled can become non-resident for income tax if they work overseas for at least one full tax year. Then his income is not taxable in the UK, regardless of where it is paid. He can invest up to \u00a33,600 a year in a stakeholder pension while abroad, provided he does not lose his UK residency. Non-earning spouses can also contribute, so John could use some of his surplus cash to buy a pension for his wife. The person making the contribution needs to satisfy the residency test. </p> <p>His with-profits savings plans are combined savings and life insurance policies and the amount of life cover payable is the minimum sum assured. If John requires life cover without savings, he should opt for term insurance as the premiums are cheaper.</p> <p>Whether to get separate policies for him and his wife depends on the amount of insurance needed. If his wife died, he would have to fund childcare costs, so John should consider a family income policy, which is a type of decreasing term insurance providing income over a fixed period.</p> <p>Atsuko has no income, so, if some of the building society accounts were in her name, she could claim interest gross. John should also consider giving her some of his investments to use her annual capital gains tax exemption if he makes enough profit to pay the tax. But he must remember that a spouse can use the money given however he or she wants. </p> <p>Danielle Leich works for PriceWaterhouseCoopers.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: James Dalby </strong></p> <p>Some of John's money on deposit is unlikely to be earning the best rate of interest. Sainsbury's Bank Instant Access account pays 5.1 per cent gross. The Legal &amp; General Easy Access Tracker account pays 6.25 per cent. Atsuko should make sure she is receiving interest on her savings gross, by completing Inland Revenue form R85, available from bank branches. John should check which Scottish Life fund he is contributing to and possibly consider switching to an alternative. </p> <p>I would not advocate chasing windfalls, but pulling out is a tough decision: do you stay in the account with miserly interest in the hope of a windfall or move the money elsewhere for a better rate?</p> <p>John is clearly not aware that he is woefully under insured. Insurance takes on many guises and it is easy to become complacent when you have a number of different policies.</p> <p>It is extremely important that he assess his life insurance situation as a priority. He has a number of accidental death policies, but they are limited to paying out only on death from an accident.</p> <p>One of the best steps he can take towards buying a house is to have a decent deposit. He could consider liquidating some of his shares or pulling some of his building society deposits together. If he were to sell shares, he should consider whether to transfer any to his wife first to use both their capital gains tax allowances. </p> <p>James Dalby works for Bates Investment Services. </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only</p> <p>Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

All that, great dress sense, and the option of true love, too - it would sound like a pretty good deal to 'he-me'. </p> <p>The sort of guy I'd be, I'd want that kind of lifestyle, too, but I'd know it would be a small miracle if women let me get away it. I'd have to be very young, very rich, or a particular kind of famous to pull off having that much sex, fun and autonomy - a rock star, say, or a footballer.</p> <p>It's traditionally held that sport and music are routes out of poverty, but it could be that, like many other forms of male success, they're also about avoiding the 'boring bits' of heterosexuality for as long as humanly possible. Likewise, everyone assumes that it's hatred and ignorance which leads to gay bashing on the streets, and homophobia per se, but maybe it's more the case that straight boys are plain jealous of the sexual freedom and variety that gays enjoy.</p> <p>Straight men would love it if women let them carry on the way gay men let other gay men, but the reality is we don't. Obviously, there are exceptions - the gay homebod, the female siren - but, on the whole, women want fidelity, trips to Ikea, and promises to be home within seconds of leaving the office. As a rule, we do not want to meet men up on Hampstead Heath for a quick anonymous shag. </p> <p>If heterosexual couples frequently bore each other, it is all men's fault for not thinking ahead. Way back in time, monogamy was invented by men to keep women in line. They clearly never intended for it to apply to them also; they didn't realise that, a few aeons later, they'd be down at the pub, nervously checking their watches, and saying: 'Just a half, I've got to be back.' You just wouldn't get dreary repressed scenes like these in gay pubs. Nobody ever rushed home to appease their exfoliating scrub.</p> <p>For every man (and woman) marriage suits down to the ground, it seems to bore and constrain thousands of others. Bearing this in mind, it seems ridiculous for gay people, especially men, to be campaigning for the right to get hitched. This week, Mary MacLeod, the chief executive of the National Family and Parenting Institute, said that gay marriage was ultimately 'inevitable'. Since then, there has been the usual outcry about what an affront this would be to our noble heterosexual institution. What tripe. It seems to me not to be a question of: should gays be allowed to marry? but rather: why on earth would they want to?</p> <p>In an age when straight men are ducking and diving like never before to avoid marriage, it seems odd to see gay men opting to go down the same perilous road. It is only fair that gay couples should be recognised in terms of inheritance, pensions and property, and that legislation should be put in place. But marriage - are they completely serious? More pertinently, would gays be so keen if the heterosexual community were trying to force married respectability upon them? </p> <p>If so, I'm astonished and disillusioned. Heteros are always looking for new ways to wind each other up, but I thought better of gays. Once gay marriage is here, once the Pandora's Box is opened, it's odds-on that homosexuality will stop being the best fun a young guy can have, and become a pale facsimile of the all the more boring bits of heterosexuality. </p> <p>It will be all: 'But why won't you marry me?'; great groaning articles on 'Men who won't commit to other men'; and 'Only half a Seabreeze for me, I've got to get back.' Before you know it, gay men will be working as hard for their sex, and their sexual autonomy as straight men, realising too late that the grass wasn't greener on the other side of the heath.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>You can find more high-profile, heavyweight, contemporary architects to the square inch in Sloane Street than anywhere else in Britain, though not necessarily all at the same time. The transformation of what was a dowdy slice of Knightsbridge into a key address for international fashion names, up there with the via Montenapoleone and Rodeo Drive, has had the unexpected side-effect of turning the street into an outdoor catwalk, along which architect after architect sets out to make as powerful an impression with high-profile new shops as possible. </p> <p>The architects are every bit as competitive as their fashion-designer clients, following each other up and down the street, and often ripping out each other's handiwork. But they must work with what is, architecturally, the most limited of material. All there is to put across a complex range of messages that must telegraph target audience and price level is that brief glimpse of the interior through the window from the street. </p> <p>The febrile nature of the fashion business means that in Sloane Street shops come and go in a bewildering blur. Taking a break from museums in Berlin and Law Courts in Salerno, architect David Chipperfield has opened up a store for Dolce and Gabbana, just across the road from what was Nigel Coates's shop for Katharine Hamnett that now accommodates Gucci. Eva Jiricna, of the Faith Zone at the Dome, designed a store for what was Joseph's flagship, next to Norman Foster's Esprit, that is now Tommy Hilfiger. Last week the store which Future Systems has designed for Marni - a recently arrived Italian label - opened in what was yet another Joseph shop. </p> <p>Future Systems, best known for the remarkable Media Centre at Lord's, has created a shop for Marni with an intense blue interior visible a mile away. Which of course in fashion is part of the point. It instantly sets the brand apart from the rest of the field. Once inside, a few deft moves have served to transform the rectangular format of a conventional shop unit. The floor is defined by a free-form puddle of reconstituted glass that stops short of the walls. The ceiling is mirror-finish stainless steel like a splash of mercury. Together they create a remarkably fluid, ambiguous space. </p> <p>The clothes are displayed on a clump of stainless steel trees that swoop down like palm fronds, weighed down by clothes on Perspex hangers. The edge of the sales area is defined by a swooping, sinuous, continuous ribbon of steel that rises and falls, and flares out at various points to accommodate horizontal display surfaces and the cash desk. It looks closer to the lush curves of the TWA terminal at Kennedy airport designed in the late 1950s by Eero Saarinen than conventional hi-tech, and represents an intriguing evolution of Future Systems's work. Jan Kaplicky and Amanda Levete, its two partners, are now exploring the sensuous potential of contemporary materials, rather than celebrating the imagery of the machine. </p> <p>Given the uneasy relationship between architecture and fashion over the years, it is remarkable that architects put quite so much energy into such projects. But they do. John Pawson, for example, spent two years working on his store for Calvin Klein in Manhattan with its cashmere smooth stone floor and its serene spaces. And Issey Miyake was probably the most important client that the great Japanese architect Shiro Kuramata ever had. And in Britain Miyake used both Stanton Williams and David Chipperfield. </p> <p>Architecture has been both fascinated by, and dismissive of, fashion. Le Corbusier once put the sense of barely concealed mutual antagonism into words when he suggested that style in architecture was of no more significance than the feathers on a woman's hat, pretty enough but of no real importance. But Adolf Loos found the issue of clothes one of abiding interest. He wrote a series of essays in which he claimed to find the restraint of English tailoring the perfect expression of modernity. </p> <p>Architects like to see themselves as being somehow beyond fashion. They regard their work as being concerned with permanence and seriousness. But they have also looked on jealously at fashion's strengthening grip on the popular imagination. Meanwhile fashion has secretly craved some of the cultural credibility that comes from the heavyweight baggage that architecture brings. </p> <p>Partly the mismatch is to do with different timescales. Three months is an eternity in the frenetic fashion year while architecture is lucky not to look hopelessly out of date by the time it has negotiated the treacle-like speed of the construction process. And even when they are finished, most buildings after a decade or so when they may, or may not look contemporary, must endure another quarter of a century in which they are regarded as hopelessly outmoded. </p> <p>Then, if they are lucky, the best of them may be understood for their intrinsic qualities rather than through the filter of any particular stylistic language. It is an entirely different pace to fashion. </p> <p>Yet fashion is about a whole range of issues that are anything but trivial. Fashion is about money - it's a huge industrial system, as well as being a close reflection of power and status and sex. </p> <p>And architecture has come to matter a great deal to fashion. It can be used to create a setting for designers that distils the essence of what they are trying to say about their clothes. You could see it as a particularly elaborate form of packaging. Just as you find that high-fashion shops wrap purchases in tissue paper, then put them in a box, and put that box in a cloth bag, then put the whole lot into a glossy carrier bag with rope handles, so the architectural wrapping of a store becomes equally elaborate through the adoption of heavyweight architectural firepower. </p> <p>Perhaps the ultimate in the process is Prada, which is working simultaneously with Rem Koolhaas, and Herzog and de Meuron, who are undergoing the giddying shift of scale that takes them from turning a power station in Bankside into a temple of art to creating a temple to black nylon handbags for the company's Tokyo flagship.</p>",
  "<p>Mandy Evans last saw her son alive on 12 January 1995, just after 7am. They were in the Bristol Royal Infirmary, and 16-month-old Joshua, already asleep from his pre-med, was being prepared for 'arterial switch' cardiac surgery. Put at its most basic, the major arteries in Joshua's heart were positioned incorrectly, and would have to be 'switched' around. The surgeon assigned to carry out the intricate operation was Janardan Dhasmana. </p> <p>Unbeknown to Mandy, and her partner and Joshua's father, Bert Loveday, Dhasmana's survival rate for these operations was well below the national average. So far below that, on the evening before Joshua's operation, a secret eleventh-hour crisis meeting was held at the hospital. </p> <p>It was decided that the operation would go ahead. By the following afternoon, Joshua was dead. His case sparked public uproar and served as a catalyst for a far-reaching inquiry into the deaths and brain damage of scores of children who'd passed through Bristol, stretching as far back as 1984. In 1997, James Wisheart, the department head, was struck off the register by the General Medical Council. Dhasmana was suspended from operating upon children for three years. </p> <p>Even though she had given evidence to the GMC, Mandy gleaned cold comfort from these reprisals - her child was still dead. Before long, her partner was also dead. Haunted by his son's death, Bert Loveday became progressively more depressed and disoriented. Before, the biggest trouble Bert ever got into was over parking offences. After, he participated in an armed robbery. He gave himself up, and got three years, hanging himself in his cell a little over a month into his sentence. He was one of four 'Bristol parents' to commit suicide. </p> <p>On that January morning, waiting with Bert and their other son, Luke, then two, for Joshua to go into theatre, Mandy wasn't aware of either the drama of the previous evening's meeting or the tragedy and recriminations to come. She just had this 'gut feeling'. When the surgical staff tried to wheel Joshua away, she clung on to the trolley and, weeping hysterically, refused to let go. Mandy says now: 'I wanted to pick Josh up, asleep or not, and take him home. I couldn't let go of the bed, they had to pull me away.' </p> <p>As they finally led her son away, Mandy remembers being transfixed by the expression on the face of one of hospital staff. 'It wasn't blank, it was like fear. If I read it now, he was saying to me, \"What are you doing? Take him away.\" </p> <p>'But he didn't actually say anything. Nobody said anything. It was all just looks without words. If the words had come, just one word, just one note, we'd have picked up Joshua, and we'd have been gone.' </p> <p>Talking in a London hotel room, Mandy occasionally breaks down during the telling of her story, bowing her head, until her hair forms a shield around her face. However, for the most part, she is composed and eloquent, blessed - or cursed, depending on your view - with total recall. It is harrowing to listen to her account of that long, dreadful day which would have such tragic repercussions for her family. As Joshua had been doing so well, the Lovedays were surprised when Bristol brought forward his switch operation, but they had faith in Dhasmana. </p> <p>'He seemed very confident and capable,' says Mandy. 'We needed to trust him. He had control over our son's life, over all our lives. He was a God figure.' </p> <p>Late on the night before the operation, the Lovedays saw Dhasmana. He'd come straight from the fateful meeting, but no mention was made of that. He apologised for being late, saying he'd been 'on his rounds', and asked them to sign the consent form. Unlike some of the other parents involved in the Bristol case, the Lovedays did ask questions. </p> <p>'Bert was good like that,' says Mandy. 'He didn't say a lot, but if he had anything to say, he said it straight. That night, Bert asked Dhasmana the same question he always had, \"Can you do it?\" </p> <p>In so many words, Dhasmana said that it wasn't a simple operation, but he'd done enough of them to know what he was doing.' Bert signed. </p> <p>When the nurse came to tell the Lovedays that Joshua had died, Mandy can only remember crying 'Oh my God!' continuously. Dhasmana arrived, still in his greens, with tears in his eyes. Mandy couldn't bear to look at him: 'I knew what he'd just been doing,' she says. 'My son's blood was still on him.' Loveday shook Dhasmana's hand, and said: 'It's all right, mate, you did your best.' Mandy said Bert never mentioned that again afterwards. 'He could never talk about how he'd said thanks.' </p> <p>Dhasmana might have done 'his' best but, although it appears that certain children who died at Bristol would probably have died anywhere, in a more able surgeon's hands Joshua's was a far from hopeless case. Mandy is haunted by the fact that their son could have survived, tortured by all the 'if onlys'. </p> <p>'What finished Bert off was the fact that he signed that consent form. For me, it's having the gut feeling that I should take Josh and run, but not doing it.' </p> <p>However, it was only when she was alerted by a television documentary researcher investigating the Bristol scandal that the jigsaw started to fall into place. The 'looks' from staff. The junior nurse sobbing in the corridor. The fob-offs. The inquest that never happened. The way, the day Joshua died, the hospital briefly gave them his body wrapped up in blankets in a Moses basket. 'At the time I didn't know that the operation had taken so long, his chest cavity was still open.' Mandy feels that Joshua's operation went ahead despite serious misgivings because: 'The hospital wanted to prove they could do it.' </p> <p>She saw Dhasmana at the GMC hearing: 'He was within touching distance. I wanted to hit him. He was so pompous and arrogant. When I gave evidence, he kept shaking his head as if to say, \"Nonsense, nonsense.\" ' </p> <p>She is slightly dismissive of Steve Bolsin, the Bristol anaesthetist who finally blew the whistle. 'If I met him, I'd shake his hand, but there's a part of me that thinks he's just as bad as the rest. They all knew what was going on, but nobody said anything. A note, just one note, is all it would have took.' </p> <p>These days, Mandy is coping as best she can. At times, the memories make her physically ill. When she was getting ready to go out recently, her other son, Luke, asked who would look after him if she didn't come back, if she died. As Joshua was one of the children whose heart Bristol retained, she also has to deal with that. </p> <p>'All I want is peace of mind,' says Mandy wearily, the coffee beside her sitting cold and untouched in its cup. 'But I can never have that without Bert and Josh. All I've got is Luke - we keep each other going.' </p> <p> Innocents, a drama based on the Bristol heart scandal, and featuring the case of Joshua Loveday, is on Channel 4 tonight, at 9pm</p>",
  "<p>As the New England leaves were turning to gold in the autumn of 1975, an exclusive enclave of Greenwich, Connecticut, was stung to its pampered core by a crime that could, surely, have been committed only by an intruder to its world of yacht clubs, careful etiquette and restrained power. </p> <p>Martha Moxley, an effervescent blonde teenager, was horribly bludgeoned to death with a golf club and dumped in the garden of her parents' house in Belle Haven. She had been struck so hard that the shaft of the club broke into four pieces, only three of which were discovered at the scene of the crime. The grip, which might have had the fingerprints of the murderer on it, has never been found. The killer used one of the pieces, which had a sharp point, as a dagger and stabbed Martha through her neck. </p> <p>For years, her killer was barely sought and never found. Only after a quarter of a century did the net slowly tighten to encircle and finally entrap the man now accused of the murder: Michael Skakel, a neighbour of the dead child and high-society heir to one of the most prestigious fortunes in America, related by marriage to the Kennedy family. But that is just the prologue to the story of intrigue that surrounds the death of Martha Moxley. </p> <p>The tale itself is a tragic, gruesome, blue-blooded murder story at a hub which connects the spokes in the turning wheel of American power. The Kennedys, the Lewinsky scandal, the super-rich of Atlantic seaboard, the O.J. Simpson trial and more: almost every drama that has hallmarked America's recent past is there, stitched into a ghastly, painfully unfolding narrative. </p> <p>But even more intriguing than the story is the man who spent the past 10 years piecing it together, and why he did so. Dominick Dunne is an author and journalist who occupies a curious position - a blend of jester and ringmaster - at the heart of the American establishment, which he views through the lenses of his round, owlish spectacles like no one since since Truman Capote. The difference between the two men is that Capote was, as Dunne says, 'Inside, Inside', which is why he was in the end spat out. Dunne describes himself as 'Inside, Outside', which makes it strange that the celebrities of America feel compelled to embrace a fellow so potentially dangerous to their own reputations. </p> <p>Dunne knows everyone who is anyone, and they know him. He is living proof of the fact that celebrity is contagious. He has met so many celebrities he has become one himself. But in the story of Martha Moxley, Dunne demonstrates something else - his position is at the centre of a village green around which the supposedly far-flung dramatis personae of America's lambent high -life turns out to be huddled with intimate, indeed, claustrophobic, proximity. And that when one of their own does something appalling, they gather round... </p> <p>Although, like the Kennedys he came to know, he comes from a rich, Catholic Irish-American family, Dunne never had a silver spoon in his mouth. His life, which he himself describes as 'a very strange thing to have lived and be living', has been punctuated by pivotal moments of doubt and crisis. None has been more cogent or heartbreaking than that which has haunted him 'almost every minute' since it happened: the murder almost 20 years ago of his daughter, Dominique. </p> <p>'Everything in my life,' says Dunne, perched on the edge of a sofa in his apartment on the Upper East Side, 'stems from that.' And nothing more so than his interest in the hunt for the murderer of Martha Moxley. </p> <p>Dunne and the Moxley killing found each other as though they were waiting for each other. In 1991, Dunne was reporting for Vanity Fair on the trial, for rape, of William Kennedy Smith. This was an odd thing for him to be doing, since he had been a guest at Bobby Kennedy's wedding to Ethel Skakel in 1950, having befriended the Kennedy family through school connections on the Atlantic seaboard, and shared beach holidays with them in California. He was, in short, a family friend. </p> <p>During the trial, Dunne heard a rumour that 'Willie' had been a guest at the Skakel household in Belle Haven on the night of Martha Moxley's murder. The Skakel children, six unruly boys and a girl, were Willie's cousins. Their rich, widowed father, Rushton Skakel, was Ethel Kennedy's brother. The siblings had a wild reputation and a few of them, including Michael and Tommy, drank a good deal, although they were only teenagers. Tommy, then 17, was the last person to be seen with Martha on the night of her murder and had been considered a suspect for years. A golf club belonging to his dead mother, Ann Reynolds Skakel, had been used as the murder weapon, but no charges had ever been brought and the case was at a standstill. </p> <p>In the end, the rumour turned out to be false: Willie Smith had not been at the Skakel house in Greenwich the night Martha was killed. But Dunne's curiosity was aroused. 'Whatever happened to that case?' he recalls asking someone he knew in Greenwich. 'Nothing,' he was told. Dunne found himself wondering what had become of the dead child's mother, Dorthy Moxley. 'Somehow, I felt drawn to this woman,' he says. </p> <p>He wrote to her and they arranged to meet at a coffee bar in Baltimore airport, near where she was living. Dorthy was media-shy at the time and suspicious of a plan that Dunne had developed to base loosely a novel on her daughter's murder. He told her it might turn a spotlight on the dormant case. 'I also told her,' he says with understatement, 'that I, too, was the parent of a murdered daughter.' Their daughters had been born a year apart, and each was viciously attacked by a man she knew on 30 October, although in different years. </p> <p>That moment marked the beginning of Dunne's friendship with Dorthy: she said, yes, he could write the book. 'No one can understand Dorthy Moxley's pain like I can,' says Dunne. 'She didn't know it when she agreed to meet me but our eyes met, I told her my story, and we got it. And we'll never lose it, she's a friend, a friend for life'. </p> <p> Dunne's daughter Dominique was a fledgling and successful actress, best known for her role in Poltergeist, when she was strangled to death in 1983 by her boyfriend, John Sweeney, who feared that she was rejecting him. Sweeney successfully argued that the murder had been a crime of passion and was sentenced to two-and-a-half years for manslaughter. </p> <p>After the trial, 'I felt a madness growing in me,' says Dunne. 'I was filled with sorrow and rage, and that rage became my life. I hired private detectives to follow him. I was immersed in crazy thoughts about him and about her every second of my life. But then, one day, I decided that I cannot live like this; it'll destroy me. I realised that I had to have the talent to do something else with this'. </p> <p>At the time, he was beginning to make it in New York as a writer. He found an editor, Tina Brown at Vanity Fair, who believed in him and took him on to write an account first of Sweeney's trial, and then those of other suspected murderers and villains: the Menendez brothers, O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bulow, and many more. It was in Martha Moxley, however, that he found the story he needed. </p> <p>Dunne counselled her mother in what he himself had learned: 'I told her how I had made myself deal with this. Not in rage, or in despair, but in actually doing something. My daughter's death changed my life; it is the worst thing that can happen to anyone. But it did not destroy it. That is what I told her.' </p> <p>In this respect, Dunne's involvement in the Moxley case goes way beyond beyond luck and coincidence, of course - but also beyond journalism, especially American journalism, of which the very notion of neutrality is a sacred bedrock. 'I am a mover and a shaker in this story,' he admits with defiance. 'I am not the writer of this story, I am a player. I was a part of the story from the beginning, I made it happen, and I'll get criticised for that. But I don't care'. </p> <p> A Season in Purgatory, Dunne's novel based on the case, which blamed Martha's murder squarely on a thinly disguised Skakel, was published two years after his first meeting with Dorthy Moxley. It quickly became a best-seller and TV news networks carried stories about how it had helped revive interest in a 1975 murder case. Martha Moxley was back in the headlines. </p> <p>People with new evidence started to come forward almost at once, and presented themselves not to the police but to Dunne, who had begun to appear on television quite often, talking about Martha's murder. During a publicity tour for the book, he was approached by a forensic psychologist who had been hired early on by Greenwich police to act on the case. She told him that Tommy Skakel, until then the major suspect, was not the murderer. Dunne, too, had thought Tommy was guilty and had said so on television. 'She repeated it: \"It wasn't Tommy\". Her words haunted me,' Dunne says. </p> <p>The woman also showed him the autopsy photographs of Martha's body. One of the blows to her head had been so severe it had removed part of her scalp, which then hung over her face by a piece of skin. Propelled by the horror of what he saw, Dunne contacted the police in Connecticut to try and whip the case back to life, without success. They said the forensic psychologist had stolen the photographs. </p> <p>Two years later, the book was turned into a high-grade television mini-series and soon after it was broadcast, a young university graduate, whose identity Dunne protects, called him and, over lunch, related the contents of a private detective agency's report into the murder commissioned in 1991 by Rushton Skakel at a cost of some $750,000. </p> <p>Through a friend, the graduate had got the job of putting the detectives' findings into a narrative form. Rushton had wanted to take the spotlight of suspicion off his sons. But the report suggested that while Tommy had not killed Martha Moxley, the murderer could have been his brother, Michael. There was also a suggestion that Tommy may have helped him move Martha's body. </p> <p>This was ironic; the report which the old man had commissioned in the hope that it would exonerate his dear sons instead ended up implicating them. Rushton Skakel took it badly. An acknowledged alcoholic, he had already been devastated by the death of his wife from cancer two years before Martha's murder and, as a result, had struggled to keep his wayward, over-privileged offspring in line. This must have seemed the final blow. Rushton stashed the report away and it was never heard of until the young graduate handed it to Dominick Dunne. </p> <p>'I have,' Dunne reflects, 'the kind of life in which events seem to follow me around. I didn't go looking for this, it found me. I didn't go looking for those autopsy papers, they came to me. I didn't go looking for the Sutton report, some kid just called me up.' </p> <p>The next unsolicited call to Dunne introduced two further spheres of American drama into the narrative - one in Dunne's past. Lucianne Goldberg is best known nowadays as the woman who urged Linda Tripp to tape Monica Lewinsky's outpourings about her affair with President Clinton. But at that time, she was a literary agent Dunne had befriended. </p> <p>Goldberg represented Mark Fuhrman, the detective disgraced as a supposed racist during the O.J. Simpson trial, but whom Dunne nevertheless admired and had defended in print. Goldberg wanted to help Fuhrman, and Dunne decided that Fuhrman was exactly what was needed to prize open the Moxley murder case. </p> <p>Dunne's hunch about Fuhrman was a good one. Fuhrman pursued the case with a couple of accomplices. Grotesque details emerged: Michael Skakel, who had a perverse crush on Martha Moxley, apparently used to masturbate at her window, and even relieved himself over her corpse. Working with such material, as part of this new troika, Fuhrman produced a book called Murder in Greenwich, to which Dunne wrote an introduction, which in turn caused a grand jury to be called, to hear and question Michael Skakel. </p> <p> Dunne believes an upper-class conspiracy of silence protected Skakel for years and continues to do so. 'I believe that many people who lived in Belle Haven back then know things about the murder that they haven't told.' </p> <p>Last winter, he was stopped on the Upper East Side by a man who told him he used to be a friend of Michael Skakel's. He told Dunne that Skakel told him he was so drunk on the night of the murder he didn't remember whether he'd done it or not. When Dunne asked him his name, he walked away. Just three months ago, a woman came up to him in a bookshop in Vermont and told him that she was from Greenwich and knew where the grip of the golf club which had killed Martha was hidden. 'She said a lot of people in Greenwich know, but then she refused to talk further and walked out of the shop.' </p> <p>At the hearings earlier this year, the young heirs to the Kennedy name staked their reputation on a staunch defence of Michael Skakel. Skakel had looked after a foundation called the Citizens' Energy Foundation for Michael Kennedy after his brother, Joseph, commandeered him to be campaign manager in a possible run for the governorship of Massachusetts. Skakel had been a driver in the re-election campaign of the dynasty's patriarch, Teddy Kennedy, in 1994. Robert Kennedy Jnr had, three days before Skakel's indictment, accused Dunne of mounting a vendetta against Skakel and Fuhrman of financial greed. In the New York Times, he called Michael Skakel 'as honest as daylight... a genuinely good and decent soul'. And on 28 June, he went into court to insist he was not guilty. </p> <p>Reflecting on the Kennedy entwinement with both his own life and the Moxley case, Dunne can only say: 'Well, I went to the same school as Jack; I went to Bobby Kennedy and Ethel Skakel's wedding because we all knew each other from the beach and I was dating a friend of Ethel's. Then there we all were in court in Florida for Willie's trial; I was sitting across the aisle from the family. We lowered our eyes, we couldn't ever look at each other. Then they all come back again, in the Moxley murder.' </p> <p>While the Kennedys were defending their cousin before the grand jury, Michael Skakel sobbed. Who knows whether his were tears of rage or remorse. The judge ruled that there were probable grounds for suspicion that Skakel was Martha Moxley's murderer and that case should be sent for trial. Originally scheduled for this summer, it was postponed and a new date has yet to be set. But Dunne's work is done. 'Whatever happens next is up to the law,' he says in conversation, 'I have played my part.' </p> <p>Like the Skakels and Kennedys, the Dunne family had been cursed by tragedy before Dominique was murdered. Two of the five children born to Dunne and his wife, Lenny, died in infancy. Lenny herself is disabled. But you would not think, to look at him now, that such a past haunts Dunne. There is something dandyish about him, something fin-de-si\u00e8cle , with his puckish smile, small frame and immaculate suit and tie. </p> <p>No wonder the likes of Princess Diana, Gianni Versace and his mentor, Tina Brown, were entranced. But thinly veiled beneath Dunne's charm, perfect, whipped-cream manners and that kindly gaze is a layer of reinforced platinum, the kind one only acquires through knowing tragedy from the inside, whatever face you show the world, and even if you are, as he admits to being, 'a complete tart when it comes to going to parties'. </p> <p>'Most people have a turning point in their lives,' he says, 'and the murder of my daughter was mine. But there have been others, several in fact. I was 18 when they sent me into the Battle of the Bulge, and I saved someone's life. I was a scared little boy in that war, and that had a major effect on me. I didn't talk about it for years and years. I buried it deep - but I think the experience told me that I had something'. </p> <p>After the war came Hollywood, where he was a television and feature-film producer, but after Hollywood came deep depression, acute problems with alcohol and a seminal six months living in a log cabin in Oregon, which Dunne now calls the 'really important time, when I realised what was important in life, and what was not - by asking what all this bullshit in life in Hollywood was really doing for me'. He moved to New York in 1980, then, just as he was beginning to make it in New York, came the most devastating blow of all, the death of his daughter. </p> <p>Dunne's books and journalism are superficially glitzy, but deep down, he composes dark morality plays. The very notion of this makes him clap his hands and clasp one of mine. 'They are about right and wrong, good and evil,' he says, excited at the brute simplicity of his own formula. 'They're about good people and bad people.' Does this come from a Catholic upbringing? 'No,' he says, 'it comes from the murder of my daughter.' </p> <p>There is more than morality at play in the Moxley murder story, and in Dunne's other books and reports for Vanity Fair. For all that he likes to stack his prestigious invitation cards along the mantelpiece, there is an earthy, Irishman's sense of democracy within. 'I hate to see people getting away with things because of who they are,' he says. 'I hate to see cops get lazy and Michael Skakel rise above suspicion just because he was rich.' </p> <p>Dominick Dunne has a keen eye for the case of JonBenet Ramsey, the six-year-old beauty queen murdered in Colorado. He has not, yet, turned his pen to this case but he is angered by what he sees as the preferential treatment of the prime suspects, JonBenet's parents. </p> <p>'There's a grand jury,' fumes Dunne with a rare loss of composure, 'and they are called to testify. Now, I don't know if they murdered her or not, but they're the prime suspects and they don't even have to appear. They get to do it all by video, only because they are rich. Well, that's something that would never happen to a black family.' </p> <p>Dunne's next novel will, he says, 'be my last. I have written some good books but not a great book and I think I have it in me to write one great novel, if that's not too pompous. I can't imagine winding down, but I'm 75 next month, I have prostate cancer, and have to accept realities'. It will feature the same cast as his book, People Like Us, which was set among the New York glitterati wherein he circulates, and which both loves and fears him. </p> <p>'Inside but outside,' he ponders. 'I've always been like that. It can be done. What happened to Truman Capote was that he got inside the establishment and tried to stay. It's just a place to visit. The thing is, I never betrayed anyone. People know that I know more about them than I write, and that I never write it. That's what Truman Capote did - he wrote it all, he betrayed people. I write tough, but I never write mean.'</p>",
  "The build-up to Christmas 1999 was slightly more fraught than usual. I'd been working flat out for four months on a solo exhibition of my prints, not to mention bringing up three teenage children on my own, and settling a long, drawn-out divorce. Looking back, things were out of control. The show had been a virtual sell-out, and my divorce settlement meant that I was financially comfortable for the first time in a decade, but the logistics of my life were a nightmare. I had done nothing to prepare for Christmas, over-booked my social life and, to crown it all, my youngest daughter was appearing at Sadler's Wells and had to be driven to and collected from the theatre every other night. <p>On the morning of 20 December, I had to take down the show, and although I was very tired afterwards, I decided to go shopping before delivering pictures. At least I had ordered the turkey and baked a Christmas cake that morning. I recall looking at the calendar on the wall - every day was bursting with arrangements - and thinking that I didn't know how I would cope. I wasn't eating properly, and smoking nearly 30 cigarettes a day. Still, I'd always been a high-energy person with plenty of reserves to fall back on. </p> <p>That night I was going to meet friends in a restaurant near our home in east London with my two youngest children. I put on a ton of make-up to hide the huge bags under my eyes and tried to look as glamorous as possible. I then shouted hideously at my sweet-natured youngest child for not being ready, and I wondered later if that had caused something to burst in my brain, but I was assured by a doctor that it was a symptom of my impending illness, so at least I hadn't caused it by blowing a gasket. </p> <p>I kept looking in the A-Z to find the most direct route to the restaurant, but couldn't seem to get my head round map reading. We drove round the corner and I began to feel a little odd - then suddenly pain exploded in my head like a mallet being driven down into my skull. I'd had an appalling headache five days before, but nothing like this. I tried to drive back home - I was frightened for the children, but I had to pull over. We got out of the car and I slumped against a wall. My son dashed off to fetch a friend who is a GP and lives nearby. I thought this was my moment of death - this was it . I still believe that this is what dying will be like. </p> <p>My GP friend took me back to her house and put me to bed. The pain was awful, I was dozing in and out of consciousness and we decided to go to the local hospital. I noticed one foot dragged a little as we walked to the car. Eventually, I was sent home with a suspected migraine. By the time I got home, I had developed excruciating backache on top of the headache. Both eased for a while, but then I had a second attack the next night - my head and back were now unbearably painful, and by the next morning I had started vomiting and feeling faint. We called an ambulance and I was admitted with a suspected sub-arachnoid haemorrhage - or a bleed in the lining of my brain. </p> <p>I had a CAT scan which showed no bleeding around my brain, but then a series of bungled lumbar punctures made it impossible to detect if there was any blood in my spinal fluid - the same fluid that surrounds the brain. A final, successful puncture did reveal some blood, but it was impossible to tell if this was caused by the botched punctures or a haemorrhage, although the latter seemed likely. I was given huge amounts of codeine and told to lie still. I was very frightened - everyone seemed to be watching but I wasn't having any treatment. </p> <p>Eventually, I was transferred to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel on Christmas Eve. A brain surgeon explained that I probably had a cerebral aneurysm (a ballooning of an artery in the lining of the brain) which can cause severe brain damage or death if it bursts. If so, I would need surgery immediately. I imagined my children at home on Christmas Eve with my parents - I missed them so badly, and now I was very frightened for them. </p> <p>The next day, Christmas Day, Dr Paul Butler, a consultant neuroradiologist, left his family celebration to give me a cerebral angiogram - dye is injected into the blood stream to detect an aneurysm. I was scared. I was lying on a bed beneath a bank of television screens. It felt surreal. Local anaesthetic was injected into my groin and an artery accessed. I felt a warm sensation behind one ear as the dye went up a catheter into a specific area of my brain. Looking up at the screens, I could see the inside of my brain with my eyes - my brain was working, while I was looking inside it. I will never make sense of that moment. And on top of all that there was an aesthetic reaction. The inside of my brain and the blood vessels were quite beautiful. </p> <p>Dr Butler did not find an aneurysm, which is the main cause of a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage, so what had happened in my case? The bungled lumbar punctures did not help with the diagnosis, but I was discharged as having had a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage, probably a spontaneous bleed which had sealed itself off. Whatever had happened, I had got away with it. The recovery was slow - six weeks in bed with my family looking after me, chronic backache and exhaustion, and a funny feeling in my head for months. Now I am better - I have given up smoking, go to the gym three times a week and rest when I am tired. But I seem to have permanently lost those reserves of energy. </p> <p>Still, what I have seen on the brain scans is central to everything I have been thinking and drawing since. Dr Butler gave me permission to go back to the hospital to draw cerebral angiograms taking place. I was struck by the strange beauty of the images - nearly dancing forests of arteries in the landscape of the brain. </p> <p>One woman had a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage and Dr Butler was sure she would have an aneurysm and asked the technician to change angles and investigate every part of the brain. Then I saw it. A small bubble on the edge of an artery, which I had never seen on my scans, although I was scared that one lay undetected in my brain and sometimes imagine I can feel it in my head in bed at night.</p> <p> <b> What is a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage?</b> <br> Bleeding into the cerebro spinal fluid that surrounds the surface of the brain, (the arachnoid is the membrane that covers the surface). In one in three cases, it will be fatal, and one in two survivors will die if not treated within two months. It can be caused by abnormalities in the blood vessels, a blood clot or may have no identifiable cause, but in the majority of cases it is the result of rupturing of a cerebral aneurysm, a ballooning of an artery in the brain. This is, potentially, an extremely dangerous condition and in a third of cases patients die, many without reaching hospital. Another third will suffer brain damage and another third will recover with surgery. In many cases, a slight bleed will occur before a second major one, and this is why it is vital to detect blood in the spinal fluid with a CT scan or lumbar puncture, and the location of a possible aneurysm with an angiogram. </p> <p><b> What is the cause?</b> <br> An aneurysm can be present, but only detected if it balloons or causes pressure on the brain. No one is sure what causes an aneurysm, although it is 2.5 times more likely to occur in women who smoke (figures aren't available for men). High blood pressure is another risk factor. There are rarely any warning signs for either. A subsequent attack is no more likely among previous sufferers than among non-sufferers. </p> <p><b> Who is at risk?</b> <br> Sub-arachnoid haemorrhages affect 8,500 people a year in England. It can strike at any time, but the peak age is 40 to 75. It is more common in females by a ratio of 3 to 2, although nobody understands why. Recent sufferers of cerebral aneurysm include the actress Jane Lapotaire, Teresa Wells, wife of the actor John Wells, and Myra Hindley. </p> <p><b> Can it be treated?</b> <br> A sub-arachnoid hamorrhage can be treated by removing malformed vessels. If the bleed is only slight, with no aneurysm, rest and a subsequent angiogram will be prescribed. An aneurysm can be clipped to prevent bleeding, which entails open surgery, or as at the Royal London, very fine wire coils can be inserted through a catheter into the aneurysm. A slight electrical current causes the blood to clot around the coils, thus blocking a potential bleed. </p> <p><b> Support groups</b> <br> The British Brain and Spine Foundation produces a booklet and has a helpline run by neuroscience nurses (0808 808 1000). Basic, the Brain and Spinal Injuries Charity, produces a booklet and also has a helpline (0870 750 0000).</p> <p>\u0095 Between a Thing and a Thought, an exhibition of recent prints by Sue Aldworth, is in the Friends' Room at the V&amp;A (020 7942 2277) from 12 October to 10 November).</p>",
  "<p>It was 15 years since I'd ridden a scooter - and then only along the wide, uncluttered avenues of a small American city. So it seemed wise - not to mention compulsory - to take my safety test before negotiating the clogged-up, gnarly backstreets of London. It wasn't with any great excitement that I traipsed across the city to spend a day doing bike drills and learning about road handling. Nor did my spirits lift when I entered the test centre at 8.30 one Monday morning and found it heaving with veteran bikers shuffling about in full-body leathers, creaking and squelching in unison. And they were just the instructors. I wondered, momentarily, if I'd stumbled into a queue for tickets for Motorhead's latest concert. </p> <p>It seemed odd to be lectured on safety by a group of pony-tailed road veterans who looked as though they might slice in and out of motorway traffic for fun. In fact, it was all the more convincing for that - to be warned of the dangers of two-wheelers by inveterate bikers who'd witnessed their share of road carnage was all the more sobering. I left in a state of some trepidation, reminding myself never to forget the 'life-saver' - the glance over your left or right shoulder before any turning manoeuvre. </p> <p>Things began well enough. I was testing a Piaggio Liberty which, at 125cc, is at the upper limit of what you can ride without a full bike licence. Travelling home on my first evening I was congratulating myself on the number of 'life-savers' I was casting about. Once home I thought it best to bring the bike into the front room rather than leave it outside where the local 14-year-olds tend to borrow them without, as it were, permission. </p> <p>However, to take this rather elaborate security measure I had to cross the raised threshold. Alas, finding myself with insufficient power to negotiate this little hurdle I decided - rashly you may well think - to apply a little accelerator to ease my path. Big mistake. Not only did this power me across the threshold but it also propelled me into the front room. Having just moved in, the room was near empty, save for an old cooker and table awaiting a skip. </p> <p>Once over the threshold, the bike - intoxicated with an open throttle - really got into its stride. It powered impressively into the cooker, then bounced off the table. I grabbed the brake, but since the brake and accelerator are on the same right-hand handle it meant I was throttling the bike, while still trying to brake. Which is not ideal. The rear wheel made sterling attempts to get ahead of the front wheel. It was skidding inexorably for the wall at the far end. Sensing an untimely end to this scooter test, I managed to part company from the bike before any real damage was done to either me, the wall or the bike. The old cooker didn't get off so lightly. </p> <p>It was an early warning of the bike's power, and the control it's best to exercise over it. Though it looks smart - a calculated mix of retro and modern - this is a surprisingly heavy and powerful machine. By the end of my four-week stint I was fairly certain that my biceps had doubled, since just moving and rolling it took a fair effort. Of course it also meant that it was powerful and fast - it can reach close to 75mph, though one could feel all too vulnerable at this speed. The size of the bike also means that it is a sturdy city scooter, designed to roll over rough London terrain without feeling as though you've worked a pneumatic drill all day. The Liberty 125 gives a smooth, strong, enjoyable ride and its size allows you to feel more confident on the road. And, of course, it performs particularly well indoors. </p> <p>Having tried the light-heavyweight Liberty, I thought it only best to sample something a little lighter, this time from Italy's other great scooter manufacturer, Malaguti. Their 50cc Yesterday is a devilishly handsome little bike. This is Italian design at its best - beautiful smooth lines. But it is small, and anyone over 5ft 9in should probably look elsewhere since the leg room is a mite cramped. But it's certainly more mobile and nippy than a Liberty and much lighter for handling, making it a lot less intimidating for novice bikers. On the downside, it's nowhere near as robust for negotiating the dips and dives of London's battered streets. But if you should want a compact, tidy and smart scooter, you may not need to look elsewhere. </p> <p>Both Piaggio and Malaguti have a host of other models you could choose from and it's not a bad idea to check out some websites to see what's on offer, and what bikers say about them. In truth, either will perform well around the city - particularly in a petrol crisis.</p>",
  "<p>The drug deal was going horribly wrong. Instead of coming away with \u00a310,000 worth of premium quality crack cocaine, Martin Maynard and his friend Philip Etienne had been ambushed by a team of armed Yardie gangsters who were trying to steal their money.</p> <p>Martin had lost count of how many shots had been fired. One had been so close he had felt its heat as it whistled past his ear. He had somehow fought his way out of the car and made a desperate run for a nearby low wall. It was only when he reached it that he risked a glance behind him.</p> <p>'I was shaking with fear. I looked back and saw Philip staggering round the rear of the Mondeo. He was limping, obviously in pain, and as he passed under a streetlight I could see his right leg was soaked dark with blood. One of the gunmen was standing right in front of him, about eight feet away, and his gun was aimed directly at Philip's chest. I heard him shouting: 'D'ya want another one, bumba clot? D'ya want it again?'</p> <p>'I was thinking, \"Oh Jesus, he's going to shoot Philip. He's going to fucking kill Philip\". In that fraction of a second, I had to make a decision that I would have to live with for the rest of my life. To my right was the safety of the main road. The gunman hadn't seen me, I wasn't injured, I could easily make it across. On my left was Philip, moments away from being shot dead in cold blood. It was the hardest, most agonising decision I have ever had to make. And there was just no time for it. I took one last glance at the main road, sucked in a deep breath, turned towards the gunman and started running.' </p> <p>It was the end both men had long feared. For the previous eight years, Philip and Martin had lived among the upper echelons of London's criminal underworld. During that time, they dealt in guns, stolen high-performance cars, stolen passports and traded vast quantities of cocaine, ecstasy and crack. With their plush Docklands flats, brand new BMWs and bulging wallets, they made a mockery of the notion that crime doesn't pay.</p> <p>Able to lay their hands on vast amounts of cash at a moment's notice, and with a sizable group of dedicated henchmen at their beck and call, the pair were just the kind of high-ranking professional villains that other crooks felt most comfortable dealing with. Which was just the idea. Because, in reality, Philip and Martin were undercover police officers working for Scotland Yard's most elite unit: SO10.</p> <p>Also known as the Crime Operations Group, SO10 (the first two letters stand for Specialist Operations) is one of the most secretive divisions within the whole of the police force. Even Special Branch (SO12), which works hand in hand with MI5, is relatively open about the nature of its work. In contrast, all of the books, brochures and information packs produced by the Metropolitan Police - even their own website - fail to mention SO10 at all.</p> <p>The reality of working undercover is a world away from anything that has ever been portrayed in film or on television. It is something the vast majority of police officers are totally unprepared for. </p> <p>'Working in uniform or even moving into CID, you spend your time chasing after kids nicking cars or blokes with 50 quid's worth of dope in their back pockets,' says Martin. 'You never meet a real criminal. They're the people who always have a couple of grand in their wallet. They have the car of their dreams parked outside the house of their dreams. They eat in the best restaurants and get into the best clubs without ever having to queue up. When you work undercover, you have to become just like them.'</p> <p>Part of the challenge is working alone. Although there might be surveillance and back-up in place at the beginning of a job, officers are totally alone thereafter. With no radio or warrant card, they can neither call in help or prove who they are. And it is often only at the last minute that they will find out where a deal is to take place.</p> <p>'Not only do you not know where you are going, but you also know surprisingly little about your target,' adds Philip. 'It sounds crazy but it's standard SO10 procedure that you don't delve into the background of the people you are after. The reason is clear: the more you know about someone, the more you'll end up thinking about it, even if it's only at the back of your mind. If you've been told that the man you are sitting with always keeps a pistol down the side of his boot, you're going to jump through the roof when he gets a sudden itch on his calf and reaches down to scratch it. The only way to be relaxed is to not know.</p> <p>It's a similar problem when it comes to identifying people. Sometimes you get given pictures so you can make sure you have got the right person, but then when you walk into a pub for the first time to meet them, you have to remember that you're not supposed to know what they look like. You can't be seen to recognise them.'</p> <p>For those who get past the initial assessment, the only way to qualify to work for SO10 is to go through what is widely considered to be the most difficult and demanding training course the police force has to offer. Based at the Peel Centre in Hendon, North London, the same place where the Met puts its raw recruits through their paces, the course starts at 7am on a Monday and runs straight through until 4am the following morning. If they're lucky, students manage to grab a couple of hours' sleep before starting again at 7am on Tuesday. And so it goes on, day after day, night after night, for two solid weeks.</p> <p>During that time, there are lectures about points of law, constant exams, assessments and exercises. There are detailed role-playing sessions where recruits learn to deal with every conceivable situation, as well as hands-on instruction in the use of hidden tape recorders, transmitters and technical equipment. They are taught about dealing with informants, reading body language, how to dress, how to act, how to speak while they are undercover. Most of all, they learn how to keep out of trouble - physical and legal.</p> <p>Gathering evidence while undercover is fraught with difficulty. Critical conversations can be recorded with special devices, but a whole new set of skills needs to be learned in order to get the best from them. Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, a police officer can only interview someone if they have first read them their rights. If they haven't done that, then any evidence obtained, no matter how damning, becomes inadmissible in a court of law.</p> <p>So if an officer is recording a target who begins to implicate themselves in a crime but then stops halfway through, the undercover can't ask them for more information. If they start firing questions, defence lawyers will argue that it constitutes an interview and the case will be thrown out.</p> <p>The most notorious example of this came a few years ago when 39-year-old mother-of-two Patricia Hall, vanished from her home in Pudsey, Leeds, on a freezing January night. Though hundreds of people disappear each year hoping to leave their troubles behind and start over, they almost always leave some kind of trail, take a bunch of personal items or stockpile cash to sustain them. Patricia had done none of these things - she hadn't even taken any warm clothing.</p> <p>Detectives investigating the case quickly discovered that, shortly before she vanished, Patricia allegedly told her husband, Keith, that she was going to leave him for another man, sparking a series of furious arguments. Keith, who insisted that Patricia had simply walked out on him after one particularly nasty row, became the prime suspect in his wife's murder, but not a scrap of evidence could be found to prove he was responsible or even that she was dead.</p> <p>Six months on, Keith placed an advert in the lonely hearts column of his local newspaper and an undercover officer known as Claire was brought in to respond.</p> <p>The relationship quickly flourished, and after a few months Keith proposed marriage. Claire told him she was terrified of Patricia coming back into his life, that the only way she could go forward with the relationship would be to know the absolute truth about what happened. Sitting in Claire's car, which had been fitted with microphones and recording devices, Keith said nothing for a while then whispered: 'It's okay, she's dead.'</p> <p>'How do you know?' asked Claire.</p> <p>'How do you think I know? I was sleeping downstairs, then I woke up. I strangled her. There was a voice in my head telling me to do it.' Later that same night, Keith explained that he had burned the body and that the police would never find it. He was arrested and charged with murder three days later.</p> <p>At trial, the judge, Mr Justice Waterhouse, ruled the recordings - the only real evidence against him - could not be heard because they breached the code of practice governing interview procedures. 'However good the intentions of the police officers involved, and however skilful a performer the undercover police officer may have been, the effect of what was done was to negate the defendant's right not to incriminate himself.' Keith Hall was acquitted of all charges and continues to protest his innocence. 'I did not murder my wife,' he said outside the court. 'It remains a mystery to me where she is.'</p> <p>Some undercover operations last only a few hours, others can go on for months or even years. At their simplest level, they can involve nothing more than a phone call. At the other end of the scale, a complete change of identity and location may be necessary. Most of the time, the true scale of an SO10 operation is kept hidden from public view. A line in a local newspaper that a quantity of drugs has been recovered after 'an undercover police operation' gives little indication about the time, effort and danger involved in such work.</p> <p>Philip was once kidnapped and tortured during an operation, while Martin narrowly escaped attending a meeting where an informant was shot dead. 'You never think that one job might be more dangerous than another,' says Martin. 'As far as I'm concerned, they are all dangerous.</p> <p>Any situation can get out of hand. And having to deal with such a wide range of personalities makes it even harder. In life, you always have some people that you get on with and some people that you don't. Those exact same conflicts exist when you are undercover. The difficulty there, though, is that you can't just walk away, you have to carry on with the job, no matter how much of a prat you think the person you are dealing with is.'</p> <p>The stress of pretending to be someone else comes from all directions. Undercover officers often comment on the fact that they don't like the way members of the public look at them when they are working. Especially for those who are in uniform, they are normally treated with a degree of respect. When they play a drug dealer or fraudster, people refuse to make eye contact, cross the road to avoid them, and security guards hover nearby whenever they are out shopping. It's this kind of stress that makes SO10 officers more susceptible to corruption. </p> <p>During one operation, Philip was acting as the money man in a drugs buy and had \u00a360,000 in an old carrier bag. The meeting was delayed for four hours, so rather than taking the money back to his office, he just popped home and watched a bit of TV. 'I left the money in a bag on the sofa and went upstairs to the bathroom. At the same time, my wife arrived home and almost had a heart attack. She thought I'd stolen it.' </p> <p>Another danger in 'going native' is becoming too like the people that you target. You can become so absorbed in the role you are playing, you find it almost impossible to stop. In the mid-80s, Operation Own Goal set its sights on a group of football hooligans following Chelsea. </p> <p>Teams of young, relatively inexperienced, officers were sent out to join the notorious Headhunters gang and report back. Hangers-on were not welcomed by the hooligans. The only chance the officers had of surviving was to participate in everything that was going on. And to be seen to participate. In the space of a few weeks, a number of officers had been implicated in a range of assaults, robberies and drug offences. When the operation finally came to court, all but a handful of the charges against the hooligans were thrown out. </p> <p>In 1996, following a highly critical internal report, the mechanism for monitoring the health and well-being of members of SO10 were radically overhauled. Such officers are now subjected to regular psychological checks to ensure they can be pulled out of a job at the first sign of trouble. </p> <p>For those who make the grade and continue working, the dangers remain as real as ever. </p> <p>The job that ended the careers of Philip and Martin began in Handsworth, Birmingham, when an informant for the local drug squad passed on a tip that his former friends, Carl and Lenny Marshall, were well on their way to becoming the biggest crack dealers in the Midlands.</p> <p>Crack cocaine is usually sold in 'rocks' costing around \u00a320 each, and even the most active dealers tend to have only a few rocks on them at any one time. The Marshalls, however, were selling the stuff in lumps the size of house bricks, each with a wholesale price of up to \u00a390,000. Broken up into street-size deals, the same crack would be worth more than \u00a3500,000.</p> <p>The Jamaica-born brothers had inspired such fear among the residents around their home that they were able to operate with virtual impunity. They had also successfully identified every single member of the local drug squad and all their unmarked vehicles, countering any attempts to monitor their activities. The Marshalls also refused to deal with white buyers, ruling out any kind of standard sting operation.</p> <p>West Midlands police decided to launch an undercover operation against the gang, but found they had only one experienced black undercover officer. He was successfully introduced to the gang via an informant, but to act on his evidence would leave the informant exposed to retribution. More undercover officers would be needed and Martin and Philip, by then two of the most experienced officers at SO10, were called in.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks, Martin met Carl on a number of occasions and bought nearly \u00a31,000 of crack from him. 'All the deals took place in dark alleyways with me surrounded by Carl's cronies. They were incredibly aggressive and went around in combat trousers, heavy boots and tracksuit tops with hoods up over their heads, so you could never see their faces. I've dealt with plenty of people who have been much scarier, but still it was a job I wanted to get out of the way as quickly as possible.'</p> <p>A date was set for Martin to buy \u00a310,000 worth of crack. At the moment the drugs were produced, a back-up team of West Midlands officers would swoop down and arrest the gang. At least, that was the plan.</p> <p>Just after 7pm on a cold October night, Philip and Martin were sitting in the undercover car waiting for Carl to show up. Rather than a BMW or a Merc, they had been forced to take a Mondeo, hardly a typical drug dealer's car, because all the other vehicles in the SO10 pool had been booked out. Carl was already an hour late, but in a series of phone calls he had assured them he was on his way. The pair felt they had no option but to wait. The car was parked in a side street opposite a busy Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. Although it was dark, there were plenty of people about and the back-up team were just seconds away. There was no real cause for concern.</p> <p>Two men in combat trousers walked by the front of the car, then turned and knocked on Philip's window. 'Do you have a light?' one of them asked. Philip wound down the window to tell them he didn't, but the second there was a gap, both men reached inside the car and tried to grab the keys from the ignition. Martin instantly jumped out of the car and gave the signal to the back-up team that they were in trouble. Then he got back in the car, expecting Philip to drive off. But he'd lost his grip on the keys, and as Martin sat down, Philip got out of the car to try to retrieve them. At that point, Martin realised there was no point staying in the car and went to get out again. He opened the door and found himself staring down the barrel of a gun.</p> <p> 'I didn't know who the gunman was - I couldn't see his face, just his eyes floating in the shadows inside the hood of his jacket. I didn't know where he came from, either: he just appeared from nowhere, the second I opened the car door, filling the gap and blocking my escape. There was a gun in his pocket and he was pointing it right at my head, finger on the trigger. His voice, a harsh mix of Birmingham street slang and Jamaican patois, was loaded with aggression. 'Get back in the car, bumba clot,' he screamed. 'Back in the car, get back in the fucking car, before I kill you.'</p> <p>'Jesus, I was terrified. I could feel everything leaving my body. I felt dead already. I just wanted to cry - that's how bad it was, I just wanted to sit there and cry right in front of him. Somewhere behind me, I could hear my partner, Philip, fighting with the other men, the two guys who had come up to the car and asked for a light. I knew he was in trouble, but I couldn't take the time to look round. I couldn't even blink.'</p> <p>'That's when the shooting started. It's nothing like the movies - when someone fires a gun in real life, it's deafening. But at the same time, the sound is totally crisp, as clear as a bell, a perfect sharp crack like a giant banger on Guy Fawkes. And immediately you're surrounded by smoke, like a genie's come out of its bottle.'</p> <p>Neither Martin nor the man threatening him had any idea who had done the shooting, or who had been shot. They were equally startled. As far as the attackers were concerned, Philip and Martin were a pair of drug dealers who had come up from London. It was highly likely that they had guns of their own.</p> <p>Martin took advantage of the confusion to make his dash for freedom. He pushed past the gunman and ran for the wall, a bullet zipping past his head as he went. He reached the wall and gave the signal to the back-up team again. He could not believe that they hadn't got there yet. What was going on?</p> <p>And then he saw Philip and turned back.</p> <p>Philip takes up the story: 'The first shot had gone right through my calf and now I was about to take another in the chest. I felt sick inside, as I realised there was nothing I could do. I was all alone, literally staring death in the face. He was moving the gun from side to side and the light kept catching against the triangular sight over the muzzle. It was coming in and out of view, totally hypnotic. For a while, all I could see was the gun and the sight, as though there was nothing else in the world. And I knew it would be the last thing I would ever see.</p> <p>'I was still staring at the gun when I became aware of a flash of movement at the edge of my vision. It was Martin. I forced myself not to watch as he sprinted closer. Instead, I looked at the gunman's eyes for the first time and thought, right, you're going to get it now. He was so busy showing off the gun, playing the macho gangster, that he hadn't even noticed.</p> <p>'Martin powered in with both arms flying and smashed straight into the gunman who was sent sprawling on to the car. He bounced off, while Martin span round with the momentum of the impact. The gunman tried to level his weapon, but was too shaken to line up the shot. Martin was still spinning when the bullet ripped into his right shin. I could see his leg deforming as the bullet entered. His leg whipped round fast and he flew back through the air, landing hard on his back.</p> <p>'The gunman was winded, and despite my injury, I knew I had to act quickly, I hobbled over while he was distracted and struck him hard in the throat with my forearm. He went straight down on the floor. 'That's when I made my big mistake. I assumed the man underneath me had dropped the gun. I was so sure, I didn't even bother looking for it when I sat on him. I wound up to deliver a haymaker that would put him out of his misery. Then I felt him twist his hand and push the barrel of the gun under my buttock. \"Oh fuck,\" I thought. \"He's still got the damn thing...\"</p> <p>'I felt the bullet enter my body just below my groin and travel up into my pelvis. The force of the shot picked me up and dumped me hard on my back. I felt like my insides were on fire and just lay on the Tarmac, totally still, waiting for the gunman to finish me off.'</p> <p>From where Martin lay on the ground, blood pouring from the wound in his leg, it looked as though Philip had been killed outright. 'My whole world caved in, when I saw him take that final shot. All I could think was that I'd picked the guy up that morning from the home he shared with his wife and kids, and now he was dead. And it was all because I'd asked him to get involved. Somehow, I managed to climb to my feet. I started running towards a video shop. I could feel the bones in my leg crumbling as I went. It was agony, but I knew it was the only chance I had. Seconds after I reached the shop, the back-up team finally arrived, but it was only when I saw Philip in the hospital bed beside me that I truly accepted that he was still alive.'</p> <p>\u0095 Both men recovered from their injuries, but still bear the mental and physical scars of their ordeal. They were later medically retired from the police force.</p> <p>This extract is from The Infiltrators by Philip Etienne and Martin Maynard with Tony Thompson (\u00a315.99, Michael Joseph).</p>",
  "<p>' Would you like a swim?' Domitilla Getty is known to be a generous and relaxed hostess. And after a long and dusty drive deep into the hills of Tuscany, to the country farmhouse she and her husband Mark Getty (grandson of John Paul, the oil tycoon, and owner of the famous Hulton Getty picture archive) bought in the 80s, the thought of plunging into a pool could not be sweeter. </p> <p>It is the last day of Domitilla's summer in the country before she flies back to the couple's home in Battersea in London. There is work to be done over the next few months. The swimming pool - a big square of rippling turquoise - is going to have a make- over. 'Tuscany is like Miami now,' says Domitilla. In accordance with tougher planning laws in Tuscany, the pool will be painted black so that it doesn't stand out quite so much from the greenery of the surrounding hills. Next summer, it will be dark and velvety, like a natural pond. But Domitilla confesses she never swims in it anyway. She prefers to dive into the sparkling river nearby, with its waterfalls and rocks. Her three children, all boys aged between 10 and 16, love the pool, of course, as do their friends, who often come to stay. 'This place can be really chaotic,' says Domitilla. </p> <p>To call this a farmhouse is an understatement. It's actually a small village, with the main house, two wells, and several other smaller houses, barns and outhouses - one with its own olive press, dated 1821 - clustered around it. Originally, families of 15 would have lived in a two-room house, above their animals. But when the Gettys discovered it - Domitilla's mother-in-law was one of the first to spot the potential of a Tuscan farmhouse when she bought hers back in 1963 - there was just one old hermit still living there. When he died the place went up for auction and it was a case of paying a mere \u00a3500 to the nine different owners of the houses, some of whom didn't even know the properties existed. Mark has called the country retreat one of their greatest luxuries. Although it was a bargain to buy, it must have been a bottomless money pit since. </p> <p>From the outside, the buildings look quite tumbledown and ramshackle. Part of that is on purpose ('if you re-do the rendering they look all modern', says Domitilla) and part of it is because there are some buildings that they haven't even started on yet. They are still in the same state as they were in the 80s, literally dark, crumbling stone barns with wooden shutters. The main house has charmingly rough rendering, and lots of lovely bougainvillea creeping over it. A stone near the entrance has a date etched into it: eighteen fifty-something. When the roof was being mended on the house by the pool, the workmen found another date on a terracotta tile which had been there since 1588. But the house has been on the maps, says Domitilla, since the first century. </p> <p>Inside, you can see how old the place is by the thickness of the walls. The main living area is on the first floor, as it would have been originally. 'There were animals everywhere underneath and the signori would have lived on the top floor.' What is astonishing about the house, however, is not the thickness of the walls, but what's painted on them. In almost every room, the original stencilling, used to decorate instead of wallpaper, has been restored. 'This might have been the old dining room,' suggests Domitilla, pointing out the bowl of fruit painted above the doorway. The walls are covered with detailed frescoes of rural life, with hills, castles, clouds, birds, and bowls of fruit. Upstairs in the bedrooms and bathrooms, the stencilled patterns are immaculate. Many were only discovered after the layers of white paint on the walls had been removed. 'It was very much like finding treasure,' she says. </p> <p>If you have ever wondered why there was such a fuss about stencilling in the 80s, this is a very good reason. But there is nothing twee about these stencils, which date from the 19th century. The walls in one bedroom look as though they have been done with woodblocks, a pattern repeated around the whole room in rich Tuscan earthy reds. The stencils give the house both a rustic simplicity and a decorative richness that dictate the overall look of the place. 'I hate modern stencils,' says Domitilla. 'But this is real. All the ceilings were done with brick red Terra de Siena, and lots of the stencils are painted with it too. They were made to look like old grand palaces.' </p> <p>There is nothing flash or vulgar about the Getty farmhouse. The furniture is homely and simple, a mix of rustic antiques and modern comfort. We have walked into the main hallway, with its huge stone fireplace - more of a bonfire than a hearth - and into a room with a great stone trough of a sink. When they first bought the place, the sink had fallen through into the room below, but luckily, it was unbroken. The floor tiles were made in Morocco to a traditional Italian design. The next room is Domitilla's study, with a big, old desk, from which she runs a small, cult fashion label called Miss Italy. Domitilla first began with a small collection of bikinis she sold at The Cross in west London. 'The idea is to recycle the old fabrics and use old techniques to keep the tradi tional artisans of Italy going.' She began using vintage fabrics, but now as the business has grown, she uses new fabrics too so that pieces can be properly manufactured by her team of women who work from an old butchers shop in the village. </p> <p>At one end of the study is an armoire packed with rolls of brightly coloured fabrics, collected by Domitilla wherever she goes. Her sample room is brick with a timber roof, and clothes hanging from the window shutters - new designs, mixed with items of vintage clothing that might have inspired a sleeve here or a collar shape there. 'The whole collection for next summer is based on Capri in the 50s,' says Domitilla. There are lido trousers, shirts made out of fine Jacquards usually used for men's shirts, a Principessa dress, a little 40s jacket, and her signature 'house dress' - a simple print summer dress with a frill at the hem, like the ones both she and her Italian cook, Ivana, are wearing today. </p> <p>A solid stone staircase leads upstairs into a long hallway, painted white and hung with little French chandeliers. 'There were no bathrooms originally,' says Domitilla. Now there are two, and 10 bedrooms used mainly by the family. Guests who stay have a choice of the 'big house' or the house by the pool, which has a huge reception downstairs and a bedroom with a simple four-poster bed made locally. In one room, there are two wonderful Art Deco chrome beds, with bronze statuettes at the bottom and medallions at the heads. 'That's where you would have had inscribed the husband and wife's initials.' Domitilla bought them from the Arezzo antique market. </p> <p>She was born in New York, but went to school in Rome where she trained at the fashion and theatre design school. After she and Mark married, they moved to San Francisco, New York and then to London, where they have lived for 15 years. She had her first child at the age of 24. Now that the children are old enough to look after themselves, she is getting on with her own business. As well as the clothes, there is a line of shoes and accessories and she plans to launch a perfume next spring. 'I would love to live in Italy full-time,' she says. 'I would rather live in the country. There are always a lot of people here so you never feel isolated.' </p> <p>Over a lunch of simple pasta with home-grown tomatoes, garlic and basil from the vegetable plot, a dish of baked courgettes, salad, and prosciutto, followed by soft, melt-in-the-mouth almond biscuits (a local speciality), Domitilla chats merrily away, occasionally humming along to the soundtrack of classic Italian songs she has put together to play at the opening of a show of fashion and photography in London. It is all very perfect. All so rustically Italian, with the gentle green hills and the olive groves rolling away into the distance. </p> <p>The only thing left to do is have a quite snooze by the pool, and dream that this is the way life really is.</p> <p>\u0095 Miss Italy is at the Hulton Getty Gallery, 3 Jubilee Place, London SW3, until 21 October.</p>",
  "In the early 90s, you knew you'd arrived as a rock group the day you made it on to MTV and the Beavis &amp; Butthead show. So it's 1993 and the joke is that Beavis has heard the song before, while Butthead hasn't. Over soft guitars, someone is singing in a baleful falsetto about a girl who makes him cry. Butthead is not alone in feeling impatient. <p>Beavis: 'Don't worry Butthead, it gets cool in a minute.' </p> <p>Butthead: 'It better start rocking or I'll really give him something to cry about.' </p> <p>Beavis: 'Shut up Butthead, it's cool. Check it out, check it out! Here it comes...' </p> <p>[Metallic guitars ejaculate into a chorus of 'I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, I don't belong here.'] </p> <p>Beavis: 'Yes! Yes!' </p> <p>Butthead: 'This is pretty cool.' </p> <p>Beavis: 'Yeah yeah yeah yeah.' </p> <p>Butthead: 'Uh?...Uhh?' </p> <p>[The soft guitars return.] </p> <p>Beavis: 'What... what's going on...? How come they don't just, like, play that cool part through the whole song?' </p> <p>Butthead: 'Well, Beavis, if they didn't have, like, a part of the song that sucked, then, it's like, the other part wouldn't be as cool.' </p> <p>Beavis: 'Really? You're pretty smart Butthead. Hey, here it comes again. Yes! Yes! Raaawk...!' </p> <p>By the end, they've observed that the singer seems a little low on self-esteem and have helpfully struck up a chant of 'I am somebody, I am somebody'. They are sending up Radiohead, five sallow public schoolboys from Oxford, and they will be neither the first nor the last. Back home, the single which broke them in the US, 'Creep', sank without trace on the first occasion of its release. The NME called them 'a lily-livered excuse for a rock band' ('and they may have had a point,' affable guitarist Ed O'Brien allows late one night in a Parisian hotel bar, seven years later). They were dismissed as a corporate-funded Nirvana-lite and eclipsed by the arrival of Suede, a home-grown rebuke to American grunge, who presaged Britpop and had everything Radiohead didn't; a clear raison d' \u00eatre, a great first album and the support of the press. </p> <p>And Suede had a sexy singer. If John Osborne had been born 30 years after he was, there is no question he'd have chosen rock'n'roll over the theatre, and if you imagine the adenoidal playwright modified with a few genes from Richard III, you have the public face of Radiohead's singer circa 1993. Thom Yorke was born in October 1968, with the muscles in his left eye paralysed, a condition which demanded no less than five operations before the age of six. It can still be the case that when he turns his head to the side and fixes you with his cornflower-blue right eye, his left appears to be glaring at someone on the other side of the room, who's annoying him even more than you are. Strangely, this gives him a kind of presence and may be what drummer Phil Selway is referring to when he says that Yorke 'was very noticeable and always stood out in a crowd' at school. </p> <p>Needless to say, the singer was teased mercilessly when young and could be forgiven for being in a funk with the world, which he learnt from an early age to vent through his music. He was a fighter at school and there is often an undercurrent of rage and frustration in even his most reflective lyrics. He confirms that he still gets hate mail from fans he upset during his last tour. 'Being in a band is about wreaking revenge on the world,' he once conceded. 'It's like when you get chucked by your first girlfriend. You just say to yourself: \"I'm going to be famous one day, and she'll regret that...\"' </p> <p>Now we find Thom Yorke standing on a stage, inside a huge blue tent, with lights skittering across the angled surfaces above him and 10,000 rapt Parisians gazing at him from below. In the early days, you'd have got long odds on Radiohead being here, with two seminal albums under their belts, in the form of The Bends (1995) and OK Computer (1997). You'd have got longer odds on their fourth album, Kid A, which is released tomorrow, sparking the kind of critical discussion which hasn't been heard since the two European groups who changed pop - the Beatles and Kraftwerk - were at their peaks. Some critics are calling it a commercial suicide note. </p> <p>This is the second of two Parisian dates on a short European tour which involves two different tents leapfrogging each other across the continent. It's an enormous production and all the dates are sold out. At this particular moment toward the end of the show, Yorke is the only real focus. His voice brings to mind an angel being attacked by a swarm of bees and he spins a melody the way a spider spins a web, gossamer and intricate, allowing it to drift across a jackhammer electro beat which makes the floor judder and your scalp tingle. As lights strobe and guitarists O'Brien and Jonny Greenwood help to propel the song towards an urgent crescendo, Yorke starts to shudder and squirm as though someone's plugged him into the mains, as though caught up in religious ecstasy. It's an extraordinary moment and I've only ever heard a more fevered response to something a band has done once before - and Take That only had to walk on stage at Wembley to elicit that. </p> <p>The song is 'Idioteque' and tonight's audience have never heard it before, or anything like it. It's the eighth tune on Kid A and the most striking result of a creative crisis that afflicted the group and has taken the better part of two turbulent years to resolve. The trouble began with OK Computer, which is regarded, with a degree of unanimity as the finest British rock album of the past decade (closely followed by The Bends).</p> <p>In its wake, the quintet were obliged to tour for a full 12 months, a process which they had been through with The Bends and nearly failed to recover from. This time, Yorke came back disenchanted with the guitar music he had been making and resolved to change it. Melody, he has said, came to seem like 'an embarrassment'. He wanted the emphasis to switch to rhythm. 'I just wasn't interested in guitar music anymore,' he will tell me, going on to deny any suggestions that bravery was involved in tearing Radiohead down and starting over again, saying, 'Yeah, but things were being torn down anyway. That's how I felt. There was no being brave. It was \"I either do this or forget it. Just stop.\"' </p> <p>The frightening thing, Yorke will add, is that he saw no way out. He had always been the catalyst for Radiohead and there was no one else to take up the reins now. ('We operate like the UN,' he told one interviewer drily, 'and I'm America.') </p> <p>In February 1999, the five members convened in Paris for a month during which almost nothing was achieved. The same thing happened in Copenhagen later, during which time each individual member had begun to have doubts as to whether the less traditional, less methodical approach the singer was trying to foist on them could ever work - and even if it did, whether there would be a place for them within it. </p> <p>Yorke had played in a techno group called Flickernoise while studying art and English at Exeter University, but the electronic artists he was holding up as pointers to the way forward now (such as The Aphex Twin and Autechre) mostly worked on their own or in pairs. Nothing was happening and the band was insecure. On some of the tracks, none of them were being asked to contribute directly at all. Only three of the 10 pieces that would eventually comprise Kid A have any obvious guitar parts on them. Selway was not alone in realising that they had been together for 15 years and were essentially the same schoolboy band they'd started out as. But they weren't schoolboys anymore. </p> <p>Tensions rose until a series of blazing rows led to an acknowledgment that there was space for them all, even though they might not be playing their usual instruments on every track, and earlier this year the album began to take shape. The group were reputedly close to splitting up again in February over the issue of whether to pour all of the 23 tracks they'd recorded on to a double album, or whittle it down to a concise single disc. Once the brooding, piano-driven 'Everything In Its Right Place' had been chosen to open proceedings, the rest of the sequence followed naturally. At only 48 minutes long, Kid A was conceived of, and sounds like, a unitary piece of work, rather than a collection of songs. </p> <p>Radiohead will admit to eschewing photo shoots partly because they look so peculiar together. They range in height from Yorke's flyweight 5'7\", to Ed O'Brien's hulking 6'5\", and in age from drummer Selway's 33 to Jonny Greenwood's boyish 28. They met at Abingdon school in the Oxford suburbs and, Yorke excepted, are as articulate and easy-going a crew as you could hope to find anywhere.</p> <p>I met the brothers Jonny and Colin Greenwood (guitar and bass, respectively) in a north London restaurant, where we chatted amiably about the obvious things, along with history (which Colin read at Peterhouse College, Cambridge), books and music. Jonny was at his most animated when describing the influence of composers Penderecki and Messiaen on his string arrangements for OK Computer and Kid A and Colin explained Radiohead's attitude to fame and success in a way that was unusually comprehensible. </p> <p>'I think, as long as you keep moving, you're all right,' he said. 'The thing is you're always developing and expanding. It's a protean thing and a public image can't keep pace with it. So it - the process of success - is like this slow-drying glue that sets around you, that slows you down and gums you up. And while all that's happening, your own life's going on at the side of it, with your own relationships and your own experiences and that becomes sort of calcified as well. And the whole thing just grinds to a halt really. And then you suddenly find yourself in the paper or on the cover of a magazine and your life and experiences have become summarised. And once its summarised, its over. So the trick is to try to be in the corner of people's vision, but not full on.' </p> <p>How much do you feel like rock stars, I'd asked? There had been a wary pause, before Jonny pitched in with 'I don't know. It feels like Radiohead are famous. But that no one knows who we are. Which is brilliant, really.' </p> <p>By the time we sit down to talk on the train from Paris to London, Thom Yorke has been a thorn in my side for several days. On the whole, he doesn't talk to the British press, because he feels misunderstood and misrepresented by them. He is annoyed by the accusations of miserabalism and implications that he is a spoilt middle-class charlatan. On the latter, he is vituperative. </p> <p>'The middle-class thing has never been relevant,' he spits. 'We live in Oxford, and in Oxford we're fucking lower class. The place is full of the most obnoxious, self-indulgent, self-righteous oiks on the fucking planet, and for us to be called middle class... well, no, actually. Be around on May Day when they all reel out of the pubs at five in the morning puking up and going \"haw haw haw\" and trying to hassle your girlfriend...' </p> <p>He has also been irked by assumptions that a song like 'Exit Music (For A Film)' from OK Computer is about suicide, and that an early number like Anyone Can Play Guitar is a sardonic swipe at the vacuity of being in a band, when it was intended as an innocent celebration. Phil Selway has protested that 'I've always seen our songs as being quite positive. They confront very painful topics, but at some time there's always a sense that there's a struggle with them and an attempt to overcome them.' Yorke, too, considers that he worked through a lot of his post-adolescent angst on the patchy first album, Pablo Honey, and changed through the making of The Bends, at which time he realised that 'there's a fine line between writing something with genuine emotional impact and turning into little idiots feeling sorry for ourselves and playing stadium rock'. </p> <p>The lyrics for Kid A will not be printed on the sleeve and Yorke has resisted even explaining them to the band. A few, like the refrain of 'You can try the best you can/ you can try the best you can/ the best you can is good enough' - a piece of advice his girlfriend frequently offers him - on 'Optimistic', seem self-evident. Most do not. He describes the indiscernible words to the whispering electronic title track as 'the most vicious I've ever sung'. </p> <p> Yorke has been avoiding me to a degree that has begun to assume comic proportions and I'm marvelling at the extent to which people come to resemble their persecutors after a time, when word arrives that he will talk. </p> <p>When I finally settle into a seat opposite him, I find him disarmingly friendly, even warm. He smiles and laughs a lot, turning out to have a keen sense of humour. I ask why he is so fearful of these situations and he explains that he doesn't like having to answer for something that someone else has written. He no longer reads anything about himself, not even reviews of his records. </p> <p>We return to the turmoil that descended on Kid A. </p> <p>'When we finished the OK Computer tour, I had a sort of big... block. I basically thought that was it. I thought that I wouldn't be able to do whatever it is that I do again. We were still sort of working, but I had no faith in it. So I was in this endless cycle - and it was very much on my own as well, because we didn't see each other much for awhile. And I was doing bits and pieces, mucking around really. But in the process I was discovering that I'd lost all confidence in myself.' </p> <p>Why? You had just made two critically and commercially successful albums. What more did you want? </p> <p>'Yeah, but if you've lost faith in the way that you're going, then that's where you end up. I always used to use music as a way of moving on and dealing with things and I sort of felt like, that the thing that helped me deal with things had been sold to the highest bidder and I was simply doing its bidding. And I couldn't handle that. And that was all sort of wrapped up with feeling huge amounts of guilt about something that, when it was good, just came naturally anyway. So it all just went round and round in circles for ages. So there's no bravado about we're gonna shake this shit up, really. It's more like, I can't carry on like this.' </p> <p>Do you have any sympathy with the idea that rock has run its course and there's nothing left to do but trot out the tired cliches? </p> <p>'Oh yeah, absolutely. Totally. I 100 per cent agree with it.' </p> <p>But Radiohead are regarded as one of the few groups capable of taking it anywhere new. </p> <p>'God help us if we are. The thing I have a problem with is the fact that so much of what people - of what journalists - term rock music now is really not based on the music itself, but based on the lifestyle that goes with it. It's like a lifestyle choice... That doesn't mean that people should stop using drums and guitars, but why stand up and say, \"I'm a rock star - in 10 years time I'm going to get fucked up on smack...\" The mythology around it has run its course and is stale and uncreative now, and it has been destroying the people who've been trying to make the music. </p> <p>'I worry about that in the context of the album we've just done, as well. I absolutely want no part in any suggestions that our decision to use some electronic instruments is some kind of lifestyle choice. It's not. You use the instrument to help you get across a certain thing that you want to get across. That's all.' </p> <p>But haven't you often been hostage to the belief that you need to be in a state of turmoil to be creative? </p> <p>'No. No, I dealt with that one. I think the turmoil that is required is one that you can find any day walking down the street. I don't think you need to go and seek it out. Any normal human being goes through states of flux which they need to resolve by talking to people or making their art or whatever.' </p> <p>Would it be true to say that you have a generally pessimistic caste of mind, though? </p> <p>'No. I don't think so.' </p> <p>That's certainly your reputation. </p> <p>'Yeah, whatever. It depends what it's about. No I don't think like that at all, actually. For me, even when things are incredibly bleak in terms of the world you see reflected in the newspaper, I still sort of find you can get excited when you look in people's eyes when they walk down the street and sometimes you see really nasty, terrifying things, but most of the time you just see a bunch of people trying to get it together and there's something really hopeful in that. It sounds a bit bonkers, but there you go.' </p> <p>You've found touring tiresome and destructive in the past. Having seen it as close quarters, I'm constantly surprised that anyone with a modicum of sensitivity and/or intelligence survives that life for more than a year. </p> <p>'I don't think they do. I think they either step out, or they go pop.' </p> <p>Have you felt close to doing either of those things? </p> <p>'Oh, I did go pop.' He smiles broadly and gazes out of the window, chuckling. 'I definitely went pop.' </p> <p>How did this 'pop' manifest itself? </p> <p>'Oh it was a fairly quiet little pop, really. I was really... I saw this really cheesy Bruce Lee film, the story of his life. And there's this bit in it where he's standing between two mirrors and there's this break and he goes nuts and he has a seizure. Well it was like that without the seizure. It was just on and off really. I mean it wasn't like... it was just a state of mind. But in a way it was just kind of not knowing how to deal with it. And I look back now and I'm really quite happy that it happened, because it makes you decide what to do and then go on that path for awhile. And then you sort of pick yourself up and you carry on and you feel so much better that you've done it. It feels like I'm a little bit tougher than I was. I have more confidence. </p> <p>'I got really into these hawthorn hedges in the woods near where I live. The way the branches weave together reminds me of a human brain and I love the way that the rain flows along them and the life that's lived in them - it's like this path you choose to take and it gets thinner at the end. And I used to draw these things endlessly, for weeks on end, I used to go sit in the woods and draw these trees. I still do it.' </p> <p>Did your friends stick by you through what sounds like a breakdown of some kind? </p> <p>'They were brilliant. Even when I was being a bastard , they were really cool about it. That's when you find out... and that's another cliche. What I should really be doing is wearing a cowboy hat...' </p> <p>Do you think the rest of the band is secure with your new recording methods now? You could work alone if you wanted to. </p> <p>'No, but you see, I couldn't. Well, what I'd been saying to them all along... I'm built to always work with other people.' </p> <p>What do you get from them? </p> <p>'Points of reference. Otherwise, I'd just go off in lala land and then I don't know where I am, what I'm doing. It all becomes meaningless. Because I'll get bored or frustrated. My running joke with myself is like being one of those ad executives: you know, the ideas man, the painfully annoying neurotic ones who run around banging loads of charlie and coming up with one idea a month? That sort of thing.' </p> <p>Kid A is the one of the first albums to make good use of the CD format. In the days of vinyl, artists were limited to 45 minutes worth of music, split down the middle. CDs have made it possible for records to grow enormously in length, beyond what many of us are prepared or able to take on in a single sitting. As a result, we skip about, consume in byte-size chunks, much as we do in so many other areas of our lives: as the author James Gleick points out in his book Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything, we are gradually losing the ability to relax and focus on one thing for any length of time. </p> <p>To be appreciated in the initial stages, Kid A demands to be heard continuously, as a piece, in the same way that much classical music does. If this care, or rather desire, is not there on the part of the listener, it gives little of itself away. But under the right circumstances, when it does, it turns out to be the equal and more of its predecessors.</p> <p>From the opening strains of 'Everything In Its Right Place', with its elliptical piano motif and mantra-like vocal, to the near devotional hush of 'Motion Picture Soundtrack' at the end, this is a record which constantly surprises with its emotional range and beauty. As if to underscore the point, Radiohead are refusing to release any singles from it, or make videos. In future, they say, they may choose to issue material as and when it's ready, over the internet, thus avoiding the bi-annual marketing putsch. </p> <p>How do you think Kid A is going to be received? I asked Yorke </p> <p>'I think people should just decide for themselves and we'll be getting on with something else. That's about it. No other feelings. If people have a problem with it, well, I wont be reading about it anyway. And I won't be apologising for it. You can't make music and then be responsible for the way that people receive it all the time. [Sarcastically] Not unless you really know your market.' </p> <p>Is the title a reference to Carl Steadman's book, Kid A in Alphabet Street? </p> <p>'No. It just seemed to work. I think the best ones are usually like that. Often, if you call it something specific, it drives the record in a certain way. I like the non-meaning. All sorts of bizarre things have come up in relation to it. But the one I like is based on the idea that, somewhere, some errant scientist has already created the first completely genetically cloned baba - Kid A. I'm sure its happened. I'm sure somewhere it's already been done, even though it's illegal now.' </p> <p>Colin was saying that you and the others all have what he characterised as a middle-class aversion to altercation. </p> <p>'Well, I think a lot of that is... I guess in a way... we were all brought up in kind of an... those sort of schools are ultra, ultra competitive. And you never really lose it. Like that bloke in Big Brother - he says, having not watched it.' </p> <p>Nasty Nick? </p> <p>'I absolutely recognised him. And you look at him and think, \"You absolute arsehole.\" But then you think, \"No I was brought up like that.\" Achievement is everything and if anybody gets in the way you just want to kill. I think there was quite a lot of that and... that was one of the things we had to sort out, really! Cos it couldn't carry on like that... like if you were a businessman and every time you didn't get your own way, you got really vindictive with the people involved, then...' </p> <p>You were inclined to do that? </p> <p>'Oh yeah. Big time. Because I felt like... it's a weird thing because if you have something in your head and it feels like its going there, then suddenly it's being dragged away by other people, you freak. Because, essentially, in order for me personally to stay OK about what I do I have to see through whatever it is that's appearing in my head. That's my instinct, anyway, but then the best things are often those that go somewhere you weren't expecting. It's learning to trust to that. The whole point of being in a band and having Nigel [Godrich] produce us is that things happen that I don't know anything about. And the best feeling in the world is when you sit there and watch it go somewhere unexpected. 'How to Disappear' on Kid A , for instance, I had no involvement in that at all after the demo stage. Jonny did everything else. We managed to turn it into this incredible thing. I think that was good for me to see that happen and to let it happen.' </p> <p>Are you still surprised by what comes out of Radiohead? </p> <p>'Oh yeah. That's the qualification for a song that goes on the record. Each one has had that happen to it. That's the best thing in the world. It's why I keep doing it.' </p> <p>Spitting Image once did a skit on Orson Welles, under the title of 'The man who lived his life backwards'. Now look at this. What about the band who started out with an understated, little-understood album of opaque but brilliant songs, which John Peel loved, then went on to a critically acclaimed middle period, culminating in the big corporate sell-out and success in America with a compromised album at the end. Now look at that backwards. It's Radiohead, isn't it? What do you say to these people? Except, perhaps, 'this is pretty cool, huh huh huh...'</p>"
