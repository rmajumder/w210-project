  "<p><strong> Augusta Leigh: Byron's Half-Sister</strong> by Michael and Melissa Bakewell 438pp, Chatto &amp; Windus, \u00a325 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502447029.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> </p> <p> This is the latest in a line of biographies of people who are not as interesting as those with whom they are famously associated. Like the others, it is fraught with a tension between wanting to devote as much space to the famous as possible while maintaining the integrity of its project. Augusta Leigh (1783-1851) was the half-sister of the poet Lord Byron. She was also his lover. Aside from that, she does not appear to have been a very remarkable person. One might say she did no more than provide the means for her histrionic relative to prove himself right about what he had always suspected: that he was doomed to be a villain and an outcast. </p> <p>The truth is less simple than that. Byron fled the country in 1816 because his wife, Annabella, was levelling three accusations at him as part of divorce proceedings: as well as incest (not then technically a crime), he was charged with homosexuality and heterosexual sodomy (both then crimes). His conviction that he had married the wrong woman drove him to treat his wife with unforgivable cruelty. In the final stages of her pregnancy he would station himself in the room below her bedroom and throw soda-water bottles at the ceiling to keep her awake. </p> <p>Subtract Augusta from Byron's life, and he would still have found a way to get himself ostracised. Subtract Byron from Augusta's life, and what is left? The answer is an existence caught curiously between the distinctive and the obscure. Augusta was brought up at the likes of Holdernesse House and Castle Howard, before moving into the uncomfortably small Six Mile Bottom near Newmarket. Her penchant for dashing rakes - her husband and cousin, George, was one, though not in Byron's league - was the only eccentricity in a shy and practical nature. </p> <p>The Bakewells save their subject matter from this dangerous equivocality by the sureness of their descriptive touch. We read of the gambling, the gossip, the parties and the daily domestic arrangements. The sketch of George Leigh is particularly memorable. A sporting bore, he seems to have named one daughter, Medora, after a horse; when Byron became engaged, he took bets for and against the marriage taking place. </p> <p>As to Augusta, then, why did Byron love her so? Throughout their adult relationship she was either pregnant or looking after very young children. She was not interested in his poetry. When he suggested to her at the beginning of their affair (before his marriage, but not before hers) that she run away with him to the continent, she seemed eager, hesitated, then declined. This lack of passion may have played its part in the fascination she held for him; he felt that if there were scenes to be made, then it should be he who made them. </p> <p>The Bakewells stress her ability to make him laugh (she was an accomplished mimic); and laugh, above all, at himself. She made him reasonable by not taking his unreasonableness seriously, a trick his wife never discovered. When, during his honeymoon (which he gallantly termed his \"treaclemoon\"), Augusta heard that he had \"taken to stalking the long gallery in the middle of the night with his pistol and his dagger, threatening to kill himself\", she advised Annabella to ignore these \"grumps\". </p> <p>This seems to have been the key. Unable to pose, when alone with his half-sister Byron was forced to relax, to be natural and even pleasant. One of the great unanswerable questions of their histories is what would have happened if the two had gone away together in 1813. As it was, after the crisis of Byron's marriage and subsequent exile, Augusta was left at the mercy of a spendthrift husband she did not love and an embittered sister-in-law bent on revenge. Unsurprisingly, the rest of her life - as described here so fully by the Bakewells, who make it readable against the odds - was wretched.</p>",
  "<p> A little-known banking watchdog bared its teeth this week, ordering a high street bank to pay thousands of its customers more interest on their savings - the first such intervention of its kind. </p> <p>Now more than 4,000 Bristol &amp; West savers with money in discontinued accounts will get up to 31 times more interest than at present. </p> <p>The move is clearly good news for these customers, but also for anyone who has money in a so-called \"superseded\" account - one no longer available to new customers or which is no longer promoted by the bank (usually because the rate of interest is so paltry). </p> <p>The treatment of people with money in such accounts was criticised back in 1998. There was an outcry about banks launching accounts paying table-topping rates while cutting rates on old accounts and not alerting savers that they could get a better deal by switching. </p> <p>The government launched an investigation into whether banks were treating customers fairly. As a result, the banking code of practice - to which the vast majority of banks and building societies subscribe - was tightened, with rules introduced on superseded accounts so customers could be confident they were not going to be ripped off. </p> <p>This week, the Banking Code Standards Board (BCSB), which ensures that banks and building societies comply with the code, said it had reached agreement with Bristol &amp; West to improve the interest rates on many of its superseded accounts. </p> <p>In all, the savers affected have more than \u00a315m stashed away but were being paid just 0.1% interest on all balances, even if they had more than \u00a3100,000 invested. Bristol &amp; West has agreed to bring the accounts into line with its Premier Saver account, which pays between 0.1% and 3.15% depending on the balance. </p> <p>The banking code states that if you have money in an account that's no longer available to new customers, banks must either keep the interest rate on that account at the same level as an account with similar features that is currently available, or it must switch you into an account with similar features. \"This means that the interest rate on your account will always be at least as good as the interest rate on an account with similar features from the current range,\" says the code. </p> <p>If the bank doesn't have an account with \"similar features\" then it must, within 30 days of your account becoming discontinued, tell you that this is the case, give you information about other accounts it offers, and allow you to switch into one of these if you wish without notice and without penalty. </p> <p>Bristol &amp; West fell foul of the rules because it decided to link the interest paid on its superseded accounts to its low-paying Select instant access account, which pays just 0.1% no matter how much you have invested. But most of the superseded accounts were originally notice accounts which, in most cases, were closed to new savers a decade or more ago. Almost certainly they would have paid a lot more than 0.1%. </p> <p>No one actually complained about being shortchanged; the matter came to light when the BCSB was looking at Bristol &amp; West's savings rates and was surprised at just how little it was paying some customers. </p> <p>Seymour Fortescue, BCSB chief executive, says this week's announcement \"shows we have got some teeth\", and adds that it should act as a reminder to all banks and building societies that they must not ignore the requirements of the code. </p> <p>Bristol &amp; West says that when the accounts became obsolete, savers were invited to move to other accounts. But some chose to remain where they were. \"It's not that we have not communicated with these customers,\" a spokeswoman says. The changes agreed this week affect \"less than one-third of 1% of our customer base\". </p> <p>While the code clearly sets out the way banks must deal with superseded accounts -and this week's announcement is heartening in that it shows there are people out there monitoring what the banks are doing - the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of keeping an eye on the rates for savings, particularly in older accounts. </p> <p>All banks and building societies must send out once a year a written summary of all the interest rates on all their accounts, and they will usu ally highlight those no longer available so people can see what rate they are getting and whether they'd be better-off moving to another account. </p> <p>\"Don't just throw it in the bin, have a look at it,\" says a spokesman for industry body the British Bankers' Association (BBA). \"You might be quite happy with the account you've got but it is an opportunity to see what other products are on offer.\" </p> <p>When reviewing your finances, it is probably a good time to check whether you have any money lying unclaimed in a bank or building society account that you have forgotten about or simply haven't used for years. Accounts where the bank and the customer have lost touch with each other are dubbed \"dormant\". Any money in a dormant account is your property and if you make a valid claim, will be paid to you in full, with interest (if it's an interest-bearing account). </p> <p>If you want to reclaim funds in your dormant account, or think you have a legal claim on someone else's, a claim form is available from bank branches or can be downloaded from the BBA website <a href=\"http://www.bba.org.uk\">www.bba.org.uk </a>.</p>",
  "<p>It's the middle of August and deep in the hairiest of the dog days of summer, when everyone who isn't on holiday sits around in half-empty offices saying that it's the wrong time of year for work and then slides off early to the pub. </p> <p>It's a kind of unofficial siesta, where the country takes a couple of weeks off from the relentless hustle of business and news. It seems entirely sensible that we should do this, to allow the 24-hour culture to miss a few beats and remember that there's more to life than punching away at a computer keyboard. </p> <p>But there is a cloud on the summer horizon in the form of a recent report from an online travel agency that suggests that even when we take our holidays, more and more of us are bringing our work with us. According to the survey, a third of us are picking up work messages from our mobiles when on holiday and about a fifth of us are making anxious check-calls back to the office. </p> <p>And it's not just a quick call back to the office; people are travelling with a virtual office in their suitcases, with laptops, mobiles and all the other electronic ball and chains to be unpacked in their holiday hideaways. </p> <p>And when we're checking e-mails from work on the laptop, setting up a couple of meetings for when we get back, it's only a couple of extra clicks on the online banking icon to check out how the current account is looking. While we're at it we can take a quick look at the online share portfolio, just to see how things are ticking over while we're away. </p> <p>It's the flip side of the communications revolution. The technology that lets us keep in touch wherever we are also means we can never get away. In the blurb about the new generation of internet-connected mobile phones I read recently that they would \"empower\" me to check my bank details while I was half way up a mountain anywhere in the world. Now this is an impressive piece of technology, but it's overlooking the fact that we're up the mountain in the first place to get away from thinking anything at all about our creaking finances and all the other worries to do with work and money. </p> <p>But I have to admit that I'm as guilty as the next workaholic of travelling with half of an electrical retailer's shop window in the back of the car. On our last family get-away-from-it-all trip, we took two mobiles, two laptop computers and a personal organiser. The only things that we took with us that didn't need plugs were the children. </p> <p>This is a kind of self-inflicted madness, where we make great and expensive efforts to have a change of scene and then spend half the time trying to get back in touch with the place we're meant to be escaping from. </p> <p>I bet if you were reading the paper on a beach, there's someone near you at this very moment with a mobile phone trying to get through to their office. And there's probably someone powering up their personal organiser just to check a couple of dates, which is like opening a little electronic trapdoor that plunges them straight back into work. </p> <p>We can't unplug ourselves. It's partly because for the rest of the year we're sold the idea that everything is about improving communications, staying in touch, every minute and every day, online, connected. Internet banking, internet shopping, telephone call centres, wap phones, longer working hours, teleworking are all to our advantage, but they also erode the idea of the cut-off point between home and work. There is no weekend, no evening, it's one long, endless day. </p> <p>And it's very difficult to resist. No matter where you roam, there's always someone trying to get you on the mobile and if your mobile can take e-mails, they'll be writing to you as well. And whether we ignore the calls or ring back it makes us feel guilty. We feel bad about leaving work behind and then we feel bad when we end up working when we're meant to be on holiday. </p> <p>But if you really are an incurably restless entrepreneur who can't rest for a minute, here's an idea that could make your millions. If we have to trundle around the world with half a dozen cables and plugs, there's a fortune to be made by the person who invents a universal battery re-charger, so that all the phones and gadgets can be charged up with a single device. I'm sick of unloading coils of leads like some kind of family roadie. </p> <p>That's the end of the red-hot money making tip. Now the only batteries I want to re-charge are my own. </p> <p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:coughlan_sean@hotmail.com\">coughlan_sean@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p> \"I am not dust; mortal decay cannot touch me.\" The lines with which Shostakovich chose to end his Suite on Verses by Michelangelo Buonarroti, written the year before the conmposer died, have rarely seemed a more appropriate epitaph than at this concert. On the 25th anniversary of his death, the BBC NOW paid tribute with a devastating performance of the suite, paired with one of his largest works of musical architecture, the Eighth Symphony. Together they formed as searing and complete a personal testament as could be created in one concert. </p> <p>Shostakovich approached Michelangelo's work as one artist to another, setting poetry speaking of love, protest and mortality, to eloquent vocal lines supported by sparing but tensely atmospheric orchestral writing. The stabs of percussion and rasping tam-tam of the eighth song, Creativity, so punchily played by the BBC NOW, were a world away from the muted strings and horn that opened the next song, Night. It was a luxury to have the Russian bass Sergei Leiferkus as the supremely communicative soloist, his richly-hued timbre full of light and shade, his sound vibrant and alive. </p> <p>There's little of Shosta-kovich's trademark musical irony to be found in his Eighth Symphony, written in 1943: this is a profoundly sincere and personal work. Under David Atherton it received a performance of the immense scope and commitment that it so deserves. </p> <p>The symphony is almost a concerto for orchestra - nobody, from the leader to the triangle player, can cruise along in the background. This egalitarian distribution of orchestral responsibilities here served to highlight how strong the BBC NOW is these days. Each detail of the score had a purpose, and what detail it was: the biting violin flourishes of the second movement; the belligerent viola entry opening the third; the eerie flutter-tonguing from the flutes in the largo. The wind and brass sections supplied some excellent solos, from Celia Craig's intensely sustained cor anglais melody to Philippe Schartz's third- movement trumpet tune, thrown out with the careless bravado of a Latin bandleader. Again and again Atherton wound up the tension until it seemed it must reach breaking point, the breathtaking climaxes swiftly collapsing and dissolving, so that, finally, of this great musical edifice only distant reverberations were left. A shattering evening.</p>",

  "<p>Nasser Hussain, the England captain, must earn a fortune from the manufacturers of cricket balls. Every one, it seems, has his name on it.</p> <p>His wretched form continued yesterday in the County Championship Second Division when, resuming his innings for Essex on nine, he added only a single before being caught behind.</p> <p>In 12 completed first-class innings this season - half for Essex and half for England - he has scored 144 runs, which is gross in more ways than one. One does not need Bill Frindall to work out his average of 12, the sort of figure that would be sniffily disowned by bowlers, let alone batsmen, although injury and international commitments have restricted his opportunities.</p> <p>On a flat pitch, and on a ground with a reputation for fast scoring, Hussain was desperately looking for some form and confidence before next week's fourth Test against West Indies at Headingley, which is normally user-friendly for bowlers. But at the moment he looks incapable of batting an eyelid.</p> <p>In the second over of the morning, facing his third ball, Hussain pushed forward to the medium pace of Kabir Ali. The good-length delivery seamed away off the pitch, caught the outside of the bat and was held by the wicketkeeper Steven Rhodes.</p> <p>Hussain remained in position for some time, as if to show the watching world that there was nothing wrong with the stroke. The nick was so obvious that the umpire, John Steele, did not even bother to give Hussain out. He merely nodded. But when Hussain stood his ground Steele raised his finger by way of confirmation. Forlorn, Hussain dragged himself to the dressing room and refused to discuss his malaise.</p> <p>His failure yesterday looked even more poignant when he was replaced at the wicket by Stuart Law who, with Paul Prichard, added 166 for the third wicket and then another 185 for the fifth with Stephen Peters.</p> <p>Hussain is not the first England captain to run out of runs. If Mike Brearley was a famous egg-head he had a few egg-shaped scores to match. And Mike Denness had such an awful time against Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson in Australia in 1974-75 that he dropped himself for the fourth Test. There is no chance of Hussain doing that. Besides, his captaincy and fielding qualities are still intact. But a brittle England batting line-up is in urgent need of runs from him.</p> <p>The issue is important enough to attract the attention of the chairman of selectors David Graveney, though by the time he turned up yesterday Hussain was out. If Graveney is to take Hussain-watching seriously he must buy a faster car. Today the England coach Duncan Fletcher is expected at the Chester Road ground.</p> <p>Graveney said yesterday: \"Nasser is not in the best form and I hope he gets a second opportunity here. But it's not a huge issue for me. These players now play virtually 12 months a year, so it will not always go well for them.\"</p> <p>Essex's bowling coach Geoff Arnold, who has been working with Hussain in the nets, said: \"There was nothing wrong with his shot today. He played forward, and straight, and the ball left him. He is working on the line of the ball and which deliveries to leave alone.</p> <p>\"Technically he is much better now than when he first played for England and would lean back on the drive and get caught at cover-point. At the moment it's a confidence thing more than anything else.\"</p> <p>No one could accuse Law of being short of confidence. This was his fourth century of the season, which is a quiet one for him compared with 1999. It was also his 25th for Essex. He went on to score 189 from 243 balls, including 30 fours. Hussain will not be best pleased if the Australian's effort denies him a second innings.</p> <p><strong>Hussain's summer</strong></p> <p><strong>For Essex</strong> </p> <p>v Nottinghamshire 4, 24</p> <p>v Zimbabweans 33</p> <p>v Gloucestershire 3, 0</p> <p>v Worcestershire 10 </p> <p><strong>Total</strong> 74 runs in 6 innings</p> <p><strong>For England</strong></p> <p>Zimbabwe (1st Test) 10, 21</p> <p>Zimbabwe (2nd Test) 0</p> <p>West Indies (1st Test) 15, 8</p> <p>West Indies (3rd Test) 10, 6* </p> <p><strong>Total</strong> 70 in 7 innings</p> <p><strong>Total</strong> 144 runs in 13 innings</p> <p>12 completed</p> <p><strong>Average</strong> 12.00 </p> <p>* Not out</p>",
  "Problems with a new computer system have been blamed for chaos in the distribution of exam results in Scotland. <p>Almost 1,500 pupils received incomplete certificates yesterday morning. Schools were told they would not receive the results until today at the earliest, and universities were not sent the results in time to advise applicants immediately if they had secured admission to their chosen institution. </p> <p>The Scottish education minister, Sam Galbraith, has called for an independent inquiry into the debacle and the chief executive of the Scottish qualifications authority, Ron Tuck, has promised the problems will not be repeated next year. </p> <p>The SQA said the implementation of a new IT system as complicated as those used for air traffic control and new administration procedures had led to the problems. </p> <p>\"We accept full responsibility for everything that has happened in the course of this year,\" said Mr Tuck. \"We had to introduce a whole range of new qualifications, which means the documents and all the systems concerned with it. </p> <p>\"We need to make sure that things get absolutely right for the next examination cycle, which in effect begins today,\" he added. </p> <p>\"I can guarantee it will not happen next year. We will cooperate fully with Mr Galbraith's review.\"<br><br> More than 140,000 pupils sat exams for the highers, the standard grade and the new intermediate qualification, but 10% of them received incomplete certificates. The SQA also failed to get the results to the universities and colleges admissions service in time. Ucas warned applicants going into higher education of possible delays receiving confirmation of places after the results were sent to them two days late. </p> <p>The SQA has opened a telephone helpline for pupils, schools and universities affected, and has written to English universities to explain the problem. Scottish institutions had already been contacted. </p> <p>Teachers described the situation as a disgrace. The head of a school near Perth said there had been scenes of \"complete confusion\" at her school yesterday morning.</p> <p>Juliet Austin, of Kilgraston school, Bridge of Earn, said the school would not now receive the results until Monday. \"We have had calls this morning from some of our pupils living abroad asking for their results, but we cannot get them,\" she said. \"One pupil even called to say that she had received someone else's.\" </p> <p>Mrs Austin said the new system for processing results was \"the worst I have ever seen\". The Scottish National party said the delays were unacceptable and that Scottish pupils were being treated as guinea pigs for new education policies. Pass rates for the new exams were said to be broadly in line with last year's results.</p>",
  "<p>A French judge today ordered a team of experts to examine ways of blocking the US search engine and web directory Yahoo! from French users after the company was found selling Nazi memorabilia on its popular auction site.</p> <p>Under French law it is illegal to sell or exhibit material that incites racial hatred. In a previous judgement the company had been told find a way to stop French users from accessing the site but had claimed it was technically impossible.</p> <p>Judge Jean-Jacques Gomez has given the team of three experts - one French, one American, and one European - until 6 November to find a solution and will then rule on whether Yahoo! has done enough to comply with French law.</p> <p>The case highlights the extent to which individual countries will accept freedom of speech on the net. Yahoo!, based in Santa Clara, California, is protected by the US constitution if its pages express racist or extremist ideas. However, in May, Judge Gomez ruled that the service provider had offended France's \"collective memory\".</p> <p>The battle has sparked fears that one nation's legal system, such as the US, could stretch its tentacles across national borders, subverting laws in other countries. Countries have previously been largely powerless to combat extremist web pages stored on servers in other countries, but the Yahoo! case has given some legal observers a start.</p> <p>\"It could be a worldwide prior restraint against free expression,\" said San Francisco-based lawyer Michael Traynor , who filed an affidavit on behalf of Yahoo!. \"For [France], a country that prides itself on human rights, it would be an extraordinary imposition on fundamental freedom of expression.\"</p> <p>Yahoo! has pulled Third Reich paraphernalia from its French site - fr.Yahoo.com. In a further step, the company recently added warnings, in French, to some pages of its US-based site, alerting French users they risk breaking French laws by viewing them.</p> <p>Yahoo!'s lawyers say it would be impossible to go further, arguing that it is not technically feasible to keep French users off disputed websites.</p> <p>On the other side, the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) and the Union of Jewish Students of France say the country should not be subject to ideologies it has made illegal.</p> <p>\"It's linked to our history, which has known the occupation, [and] the collaboration of our government with, the Nazis,\" said Marc Knobel of LICRA, whose letter-writing campaign sparked the lawsuit.</p> <p>The prosecution has asked that Yahoo! be fined for each day it violates French law.</p>",
  "<b>Why is Yahoo! being brought before a French court?</b> <br>Yahoo!, the world's most popular search engine and web directory, was allowing Nazi memorabilia to be sold on its auction site. Under French law it is illegal to sell or exhibit objects that incite racial hatred, so two human rights organisations took the giant US company to court. Material on the internet is currently distributed freely across the world so it has turned into something of a test case to see who has the power, and confidence in their legal system, to regulate the net. <p><b>Is that practical in this day and age?</b><br>Perhaps more so than ever. The law stems from France's occupation under the Nazis between 1940 and 1944, but neo-Nazi style violence is on the rise across Europe and many government's blame the internet for propagating hate. The case will go part of the way to determining whether the internet can be regulated by nation states or simply be subject to the rules of the lowest common denominator, which in practice means freedom of speech as it exists in the United States.</p> <p><b>But if Rupert Murdoch can bar the BBC from broadcasting in China why can't Yahoo! stop sending Nazi websites to France?</b><br>Broadcasters, like Mr Murdoch's Asia-wide Star TV, beam their material to selected geographical locations and find it relatively easy to pull controversial material. However, no one broadcasts the internet. If you type \"Find me swastikas\" into the Yahoo! search engine your computer effectively goes to the company's server and asks for them.</p> <p><b>Can't search engines refuse to find certain requests?</b><br> Yahoo! is the world's most-visited website. According to the <a href=\"http://www.abc.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">audit bureau of circulation</a>, the UK portal alone (<a href=\"http://uk.yahoo.com\" target=\"_new\">http://uk.yahoo.com</a>) delivered 234 million pages in April and it simply does not know where it is sending them to. The company testified in court that no system exists to block a user's access to selected websites by geography. However, Cyril Houri, founder of geographical locating dot.com <a href=\"http://www.infosplit.com/\" target=\"_new\">Infosplit</a> disagrees. Speaking to internet magazine <a href=\"http://www.thestandard.com/\" target=\"_new\">TheStandard.com</a>, Mr Houri said that Yahoo!'s expert technology witness contacted him during the trial and together they ran tests which, using the Infosplit technology, saw that page requests were coming from France and blocked them. Strangely Yahoo! did not mention these tests in court.</p> <p><b>Why not?</b><br> If Mr Houri is correct - and Yahoo! could selectively block access - the company would almost certainly face a barrage of demands from countries world wide to remove material of varying degrees of offence from its sites. Of course, Mr Houri may simply be talking up his technology's talents to boost Infosplit's public profile. </p> <p><b>So what did Yahoo! do?</b><br>It pulled the offending material off the French portal (<a href=\"http://fr.yahoo.com/\" target=\"_new\">http://fr.yahoo.com</a>) and put warning messages on the US <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\" target=\"_new\">yahoo.com</a> site telling French users that they could be breaking the law in their country if they looked at certain material. Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang says his company will not alter the content of its site to comply with a non-American law. The <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html\" target=\"_new\">US constitution</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmenti\" target=\"_new\">first amendment</a> protects Yahoo!'s right to free speech so it is extremely unlikely the company would be extradited to face further charges. </p> <p><b>Could America become the guardian of \"free speech\" the worldwide web over?\"</b><br>Yes. Individual countries try to regulate their citizen's access to the net but, as the French are finding out, they can only stop a site from serving pages within its national boundaries. America's right to freedom of speech suits many \"offensive\" sites who can simply switch their pages to a US server. Marc Knobel, the French human rights activist whose letter-writing campaign sparked the lawsuit, says the American net is becoming a \"dumping ground\" for racists the world over.</p> <p><b>Are the French courts acting alone?</b><br>No other country is prosecuting Yahoo! but Germany moved to bar Nazi slogans as web addresses when they found that someone had registered www.heil-hitler.de. Concerned authorities in Germany have reported that far-right extremists are increasingly organising themselves on the internet at a time of escalating neo-Nazi activity. Justice minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin called websites bearing racist and Nazi propaganda \"a new threat to our society\" and said the nation should do all it could to fight such sites, even beyond its borders. </p> <p><b>How many hate sites are there on the net?</b><br>The <a href=\"http://www.wiesenthal.com/\" target=\"_new\">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a>, which monitors racist groups, says there are now more than 1,400 hate sites on the net compared with one in 1995. Many are hosted on US servers.</p>",
  "<b>How much does an American presidential election cost?</b> <br> Democracy US-style has never come cheap - and the cost is rising. By this stage of the 1996 election, the candidates had spent some $237.2 million between them, up from about $123 million in 1992. So far this year the campaign has cost well over $350 million. <p><b>Who has most money to spend?</b><br> George Bush is well ahead: to date he's raised $93,260,829 and spent $81,038,713. Al Gore, in contrast, has raised $52,568,089 and spent $41,841,378. </p> <p><b>Are there any rules? </b><br> Yes - and they are complex. The first legislation regulating federal campaign finance was introduced between 1905 and 1908 in an attempt to limit the disproportionate influence over elections held by wealthy individuals. In 1974, after dubious practises were reported in the 1972 election, legislation led to the creation of the federal election commission: the biggest innovation was the introduction of partial public funding of candidates. Since then, the rules have remained more or less the same - although many Americans are now unhappy with them and want reform. Campaign finance reform was a major part of John McCain's campaign for the Republican nomination, although it has now fallen off his party's agenda.</p> <p><b>And what are these rules? </b><br> In short, contributions by individuals and groups to federal campaigns are limited to a direct contribution of $1,000 a year and $25,000 a year in total. Contributions by certain groups - such as foreign nationals and corporations - are prohibited. In return for accepting limits on overall campaign spending, candidates are given federal grants. In 1996, the major parties each received $12.36 million.</p> <p><b>That sounds fair</b><br> Yes - but candidates have hardly been constrained by the rules. This year, for instance, George Bush has refused to take federal funds and so been released from official limits on how much he can spend. Candidates can also be supported by independent donations, which back their cause but don't go directly to their campaign. Much TV advertising is paid for this way. Such so-called soft-money contributions are arguably illegal, since most candidates establish committees to back their causes, which are barely separate from the campaign. However candidates prefer not to raise the issue since almost all of them risk trouble if the letter of the law is applied. </p> <p><b>Where do the contributions come from? </b><br> Much of the money of does come from small gifts. George Bush claims to have received 600,000 such donations at an average of $99.63. But much more comes from special interest groups. Bush is well ahead of Al Gore here, raising more money than his rival from almost every part of the economy. For instance the energy and natural resources sector has given governor Bush some $2,420,372 - but just $253,710 to Al Gore. Gore leads only in donations from labour unions, lawyers and lobbyists.</p> <p><b>But why do people give such vast amounts of money? </b><br> Sometimes they do it for ideological reasons. Both Bush and Gore's web sites allow the public to make credit card donations and list hundreds of people who have given small sums. But the real money is raised through the aggressive fundraising campaigns which take up much of an American politician's time. In return for contributions, big donors can expect access to the candidate and the chance of favours if he should win. Many US ambassadors receive their jobs in this way</p> <p><b>What sort of events are used to raise money? </b><br> Ahead of the Democratic convention Barbra Streisand is holding a fundraising brunch for Bill Clinton's presidential library at her Malibu home, which should raise around $1m. Another fundraising event should bring in $4m for Hilary Clinton's senate campaign. Al Gore expects to make $2.5m from his star-studded convention bash. More dubiously, Al Gore was heavily involved in raising cash for Bill Clinton's campaign in 1996, telephoning key donors from the White House. </p> <p><b>Where does all the money go? </b><br> Television advertising swallows the bulk of the cash - in contrast with Britain, candidates are allowed to buy airtime. Bill Clinton's saturation advertising for 18 months before the 1996 election allowed him to pull ahead of Bob Dole. Other big costs include running a company-sized campaigning operation for almost two years. </p> <p><b>What is the future for campaign finance? </b><br> It's possible that the law will remain unchanged and the election after next will simply see bigger sums spent. American voters want reform, however, and this is likely to lead to some sort of change. George Bush has called for a ban on soft money donations and an increase to the $1,000 limit on individual gifts. Al Gore wants TV stations to offer politicians free air time and wants an endowment fund to pay for political campaigning, among other things. But whoever wins, action in the short term is unlikely. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.georgebush.com/issues.asp?FormMode=FullText&amp;ID=35\" target=\"_new\">Bush-Cheney 2000: campaign finance reform</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.algore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Gore-Lieberman 2000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.brookings.org/GS/CF/CF_HP.HTM\" target=\"_new\">The Brookings Institute: campaign finance</a><br> <a href=\"http://tap.epn.org/issues/campaignfinance.html\" target=\"_new\">The Electronic Policy Network: campaign finance</a><br></p>",
  "<p> <a href=\"#a\">Role of English</a> | <a href=\"#b\">Teaching</a> | <a href=\"#c\">Living</a> | <a href=\"#d\">Points to remember</a> | <a href=\"#e\">Useful contacts</a> </p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong><br> Once dismissed as a barren outcrop of rocky islands by senior British officials when first annexed in the C19th, Hong Kong is now a densely packed, vibrant metropolis, a fascinating blend of Western and Asian culture, languages, fashion and food, squeezed into little more than 1000sq km. </p> <p>The territory consists of Hong Kong Island, the political and administrative centre, the New Territories, a larger area made up of new towns, quaint fishing villages and beautiful country parks, and the Outlying Islands, including Lantau where the huge international airport Chek Lap Kok is located. </p> <p>The climate is tropical monsoon: very hot and humid from April through to October, with temperatures regularly hitting the mid-30s C, warm in the autumn, and damp and cool during the winter months. The weather from November to January is usually pleasant enough to hike the excellent trails in the New Territories and on Lantau, or to explore some of the two hundred islands dotted around Hong Kong's territorial waters. </p> <p>The newly-arrived picture Hong Kong as a heaving concrete jungle, heavily polluted and packed with shops, banks and restaurants. And they're right, but luckily escape to the countryside is easy. Sailing, windsurfing, camping, and hiking are all popular leisure pursuits in the Sai Kung Country Park, located in the northeast corner of the New Territories. Birdwatchers rave about the Mai Po Bird Sanctuary near the border with Mainland Chinese and diving and dolphin watching are also possible in the South China Sea. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Hong Kong can be claustrophobic. Many new teachers, especially those with no previous experience in Asia, suffer a certain amount of culture shock due to the fast pace of life, the ever-present construction noise, the jam-packed public transport, and the lack of 'western-style' service in restaurants and shops. But if you don't mind the waiter casually dumping the chopsticks on the table or the shop assistants ignoring you, you'll be fine. The HK Chinese temperament is abrupt and direct; it is easy to mistake this characteristic for rudeness. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"a\"> Role of English</a></strong><br> Hong Kong is officially bilingual, with English and Cantonese as the main languages, and Mandarin as the third. English plays a major part in daily life, especially in business, education, and the law. In fact, since Hong Kong law is based on the British judicial system, cases are still tried in English with the non-English speaking accused relying on translators for information. </p> <p>The role of English in HK society has been the subject of intense debate over the last few years, especially among parents and teachers who believe English-medium schools are more prestigious, even though the use of English might have lowered education standards since many children cannot understand their teachers. When the HK government ordered several English-medium schools to revert to mother tongue education in 1998, the Education Department was flooded with complaints from mothers and fathers demanding that their children be taught in English. However, initial research suggests overall education standards are improving in schools using Cantonese as the medium of instruction. Either way, there is a great demand for qualified and experienced ELT specialists in the SAR. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"b\">Teaching</a></strong><br> There are several options for EFL teachers in Hong Kong. The universities probably offer the best jobs in terms of pay, career prospects and conditions. Salaries start at around GBP 22,000 and can rise to around GBP 60-70 000 for senior teaching staff. Benefits include medical and dental insurance, an average of six weeks paid annual vacation, and access to decent library, sports and eating facilities on campus. Good conditions, though, mean vacancies do not open up very often; when they do, competition is fierce. Jobs are advertised on the universities' homepages, in the <a href=\" http://www.scmp.com/\">South China Morning Post</a>, as well as in various international publications. </p> <p>The Native English Teacher (NET) scheme employs ELT educators for government subsidized schools throughout Hong Kong. The main attraction for teachers is the pay, generous leave, a GBP 1100 a month housing allowance, and a 15% gratuity payable after completing a two-year contract, but the actual conditions are less appealing since there are no realistic prospects of promotion within the system and the teaching itself can be very challenging. </p> <p>One of the problems is many Netters, as they are affectionately known, earn more than their Chinese counterparts, causing some friction and resentment within the staff room. The Netter is sometimes the only <em>gweilo </em> (affectionate Cantonese term for foreigners meaning 'white ghost') in the school and it is not uncommon to feel isolated. An additional problem is that Netters are randomly assigned schools and cannot choose the location or Band. Given a choice, most teachers would opt for either Band 1 or 2, schools for the 'brighter' pupils, because the students there are less likely make your life hell. The same cannot be said for Band 5 schools, which shelter many pupils with discipline and behavioural problems. </p> <p>\"I've had to deal with abusive students, kids that just come in and put their head on their desk and sleep, and very little motivation,\" reports Dan Griffiths, a teacher in a Band 5 secondary school in the New Territories. In contrast, Jane Southurland, an Australian primary school teacher, says \"teaching in the higher banded secondary schools can be rewarding because the kids are more forthcoming.\" It's a bit of a lottery, but if you are patient, tough, and want to pay off your mortgage, the NET scheme is available. </p> <p>The <a href=\" http://www.britcoun.org.uk/\">British Council</a> employs a number of teachers for its adult, children and Business English classes, and runs certificate and diploma courses for teachers at different stages of their careers. </p> <p>International and English Foundation schools are also well respected and offer good conditions to suitably qualified professionals. </p> <p>In addition to teaching, teachers who want to stay in the field but would like to work in another area of ELT can find interesting jobs in the local press. Many of the well-known textbook publishers, such as the OUP and Pearsons, have offices in Hong Kong and occasionally advertise for editors or marketing personnel. Over the last few years, several multimedia companies specializing in the development of educational software and web design have emerged and for the more academically inclined, universities need research assistants to manage research projects. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"c\">Living</a></strong><br> Housing is a perpetual problem for teachers in Hong Kong. While senior staff receive a housing allowance, most English language teachers struggle with high rents for cramped quarters. In centrally located districts such as Midlevels you should expect to pay around GBP 1000 for a habitable 550-700 sq. ft flat; in the cheaper areas requiring a long commute such as Lamma Island or Sai Kung, rents hover around the GBP 600 a month mark for a 700 square foot flat. You'll also need to put down two months' rent as a deposit, pay the property agent 50% of the rent as commission, and buy furniture if you are not keen on the circa1973 kitsch found in many semi-furnished flats. </p> <p>Eating out and drinking in Hong Kong can be fun but expensive. All major cuisine from around the world are represented in the hundred of restaurants in Lan Kwai Fong, Kowloon and Wanchai, as well as some of the less well-known such as Burmese and Nepalese. Cantonese food is very good and Sundays are great for checking out the various dim sum restaurants. And whereas Chinese people are less inclined to drink heavily at the weekends, the western-style bars are crammed full, especially Friday nights during Happy Hours. </p> <p>If you don't drink and you eat at home, Hong Kong is an affordable place to live. Shopping for food is cheap if you stick to the local markets, but if you're squeamish about watching vendors chop off the legs of live frogs or cut open live fish, use the two major supermarket chains, Parknshop and Wellcome, both very affordable. Public transport is easy to use, cheap and clean, and basic utilities such as water, gas and electricity are also reasonable. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"d\"> Points to Remember</a></strong><br> Chinese students are relatively passive when compared to their European or South American counterparts.

  "<p>People all over the world are awaiting today's judgment by a French court about whether Yahoo! broke French law in allowing Nazi memorabilia to be auctioned on its US site which can be freely accessed in France. </p> <p>The case raises a number of crucial issues about the nature of the internet and how it is governed - and they are unlikely to be resolved by today's judgment.</p> <p>In France it is illegal to sell things that incite racism but Yahoo is based in the US and, it argues, subject to the first amendment of the US constitution guaranteeing free speech.</p> <p> But, in any case - the company argues - it would be technologically impossible to cut off certain users from its French site because if it cut off all mentions of the word \"Nazi\" in them, they would sever legitimate researches as well. </p> <p>This point is debatable. Haven't they heard of Autonomy, the British company with the \"smart\" search engine that can tell from the context whether the user is a bone fide researcher or not?</p> <p>At the root of the problem is the age-old dividing line between my \"freedom to\" and your \"freedom from\". The whole culture of the internet is based on \"freedom to\", the right of everyone around the world to express themselves freely. Yet, at the same time, most countries, including Britain, quite rightly have laws prohibiting incitement to racial hatred.</p> <p>How can these principles be reconciled? One way would be to argue that the web should remain free but it is the responsibility of the authorities to track down inciters of racial hatred whether they are using a web site or any other means. Goodness knows, as recent publicity has shown, they have plenty of technologically sophisticated means (like the Echelon and Carnivore spy systems) to eavesdrop on miscreants using the web for perverted ends.</p> <p>But this won't solve the underlying issue - whose law is paramount. Why should the writ of law of the US law be imposed everywhere just because the US dominates the infrastructure of the web? How would the US react if the French decided that in order to implement their own laws they would have to send their own teams to the US to track down the people behind the Nazi sites?</p> <p>This problem won't be solved by one country unilaterally imposing its own law on everyone else. The internet has become a sort of transnational nation in its own right governed by mutual principles. Unless that mutuality can extend to stamping out flagrant abuses of freedom of speech then other - internationally agreed - ways will have to be found to curb its occasional excesses.</p>",

What do you do when both your parents die within 32 days, and you've just become the guardian of your eight-year-old brother, Toph? Play frisbee? Write a book?

But he's my problem, too. I mean, looking after your eight-year old brother is all very soulful, but how do you find the time to shag?

  "The Fijian coup leader, George Speight, has been charged with two counts of treason against the country's former president, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. <p>Mr Speight was charged with treason, which carries a maximum penalty of death, conspiracy to commit treason and being an accessory after the fact to treason, for heading the storming of the Fijian parliament on 19 May.</p> <p>However, he is unlikely to be executed, as the death penalty has not been imposed in Fiji since its independence from Britain in 1970.</p> <p>Mr Speight was smiling and his head clean-shaven as he and 14 of his senior aides, who are also facing coup-related charges, were driven to court amid tight security. About 300 supporters cheered and had to be held back by police as he was taken into court.</p> <p>The coup leader was not required to enter a plea during the hearing at Suva magistrate's court. It was alleged he \"intended to levy war against His Excellency the president of Fiji, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara\".</p> <p>Mr Speight, who claimed to have been injured while in military custody, appeared in court with a small bandage on the back of his head.</p> <p>Also charged with treason were Mr Speight's bodyguards, Vilimone Tikotani and Jitoko Soko. A conspiracy charge was brought against Mr Speight's media spokesman, Jo Nata. Charged with accessory to treason were Ilisoni Ligari, the ex-British soldier who controlled the gunmen in parliament during the coup, and Mr Speight's brother, James.</p> <p>Mr Speight plunged Fiji into crisis on 19 May when he stormed parliament, taking the prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, hostage in the name of indigenous Fijian rights. Mr Chaudhry had been the first prime minister elected from Fiji's ethnic Indian minority.</p> <p>A failed businessman, Mr Speight was arrested late last month, days after releasing the last of the hostages he had held for 56 days, and at the start of a military crackdown that saw the arrest of about 450 supporters.</p> <p>Sir Kamisese, whose presidency was opposed by Mr Speight, stepped aside when martial law was declared on 29 May, after sporadic violence flared in the wake of the coup.</p> <p>The treason charges were referred today for a hearing in Fiji's high court in four weeks, after which a trial date would be set. Pleas from Mr Speight and the other accused will not be entered until the hearing.</p> <p>Mr Speight earlier appeared for a bail hearing on five minor charges relating to the raid on parliament, but that hearing was also deferred, for a week. He has pleaded not guilty to all five charges, which include firearm offences, illegal assembly and the illegal burial of a supporter inside parliament.</p> <p>A trial on those charges will begin on 1 Sept.</p>",

  "<p>There is nothing about Nick Bateman that identifies him as an obvious villain. According to the character profile released by Channel 4, he likes Thai food, dislikes untidiness and is frightened of snakes. His hero, John F Kennedy, leaves some room for ambiguity, but his favourite film is It's a Wonderful Life and his pet hate is people who are rude to waiters.</p> <p>Nevertheless, over the course of the last few weeks, the 32-year-old has been singled out from the contestants on the game show Big Brother and publicly reviled as a \"snake\" (Sada Walkington, the first housemate to be ejected), \"a scheming rat\" (her mother), \"a two-faced, lying, upper-class twit\" (the Sun), a \"two-faced slimeball\" (Sunday People) and a \"duplicitous stock-broker\" (the Observer).</p> <p>The Sun launched a \"kick out Nick\" campaign and flew a remote-control helicopter over the Big Brother house, dropping leaflets in a vain attempt to alert the media-starved housemates to Bateman's treachery. The men's magazine Loaded has facetiously invited him to write a column for them entitled Nick's Lies, in which he offers readers tips on how to deceive their loved ones.</p> <p>The case against \"Nasty Nick\", as he has been dubbed, has grown more ferocious as the gap between his image within the house and outside it has widened. While three million viewers fulminate at his deviousness, Bateman remains one of only two contestants to have escaped the weekly nominations, when, according to the rules of the game show, each house member must vote to evict two of his peers. Neither Bateman nor Anna Nolan, the docile ex-nun, has received a single vote.</p> <p>And while his housemates grow increasingly sick of each other, Bateman is still leaned on as the group's confidant. On Tuesday night, Craig, the squat Liverpudlian, was seen trotting around the garden beside Bateman as he described fellow housemates Caroline and Nichola as \"rooks\" without \"a brain between them\". (He was later seen affectionately greeting Caroline as \"darling\".)</p> <p>Bateman effects these coups through a sophisticated process of insinuating distrust between housemates and then standing back to admire the fallout. It is a modus operandi that he unveiled during the show's first week, when a gobsmacked audience watched as he lobbied individual house members to evict Caroline and Sada, then offered the two unsuspecting women a shoulder to cry on. </p> <p>It was like watching one of those horror films where you're screaming at the screen in impotent fury, trying to warn the heroes that there is a killer in their midst and they should run for their lives. Alas, to no avail. Like the best poisons, Bateman is odourless and colourless, and destroys his prey by drawing as little attention to himself as possible.</p> <p>The latest twist in the plot, as revealed in yesterday's Sun, is that Bateman has allegedly smuggled a tiny Motorola mobile phone in with him and is keeping abreast of his public image and what his housemates are saying about him. This raises the delicious possibility that he is playing up to the audience's dislike and putting on a masterful, dastardly show. Channel 4 is investigating.</p> <p>The popular disgust for him is less justifiable when you consider what a hideous bunch the other contestants are. Most of them have embellished the details of their lives to make themselves sound more appetising. Angelic Anna was not, as it turns out, a nun, but a trainee who was over the wall at the Sisters of Loreto Convent in Dublin long before taking her vows. Serious doubts have been raised about the veracity of Andrew's claim to have taken part in a live sex show in the Philippines, and Craig the builder is, contrary to impressions, not a humble labourer at all, but the owner of a building business which employs 12 people.</p> <p>Bateman is in a different league to these petty fibbers. His deviousness has a Shakespearean breadth to it. You can image him as Edmund in King Lear, standing on the lawn at midnight and shaking his fist at the moon: \"Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law my services are bound.\" The undisputed champion of CV embroidery, he claims to be a \"senior broker\" at Lloyd's of London when he is, in fact, a junior at Willis, a brokering company for Lloyd's. </p> <p>\"He was what we call a paper hod carrier, who carries all the heavy files round between underwriters,\" said a venomous colleague who wishes to remain anonymous. He says he lives in south-west London when, in fact, he shares a house with three others in Egham, Surrey. He says he is a vice-president of Fulham FC, failing to mention the 77 other Fulham fans also in possession of the \u00a31,300-a-year vice-president's season ticket. And he claims to have worked as an escort, charging women up to \u00a3140 for sex. \"He exaggerates everything and likes to portray himself as a big wheeler-dealer, when he clearly isn't,\" said the colleague.</p> <p>The scale of these fibs raises two possibilities: that Bateman is a compulsive liar, or, more plausibly, that he is playing his housemates and the audience for suckers. As the series develops, so too does the likelihood that Bateman is creating a psychodrama through which to manipulate everyone far more efficiently than Big Brother. </p> <p>His confessions to camera have become increasingly knowing, as if scripted to whip the audience into indignant outrage. \"It's tending to bring out the worst in everyone's character,\" Bateman moralised shortly after Andrew's eviction, draping himself over a chair in the style of an arrogant playboy. \"It's the greed factor. It's wanting to be number one and wanting that end prize.\"</p> <p>The other contestants are so wrapped up in their own performances that they have yet to rumble him, although cracks are beginning to appear. \"Will it have gone out?\" Bateman asked feebly, after confessing to Mel, the pretty one, that the sob story he told about his fianc\u00e9e dying in Australia was a lie. \"I'm really worried about what people watching will think of me.\" \"Forget it,\" said Mel, her blank little eyes narrowing.</p> <p>Such is the breadth of intrigue surrounding Bateman that rumours were circulating this week that he was a plant for Channel 4, installed to stir up hatred and boost ratings. It was swiftly denied, but there is a chance that he is playing the textbook villain to increase his marketability when he leaves the house. After all, he has all the credentials: he is a toff who went to Prince Charles's old school, Gordonstoun, and is a badly dressed stockbroker to boot.</p> <p>Residents of his parents' village of Hurstborne Tarrant, Hampshire, have expressed surprise at the vilification. \"Nick is a thoroughly nice chap,\" said the village postmistress. \"He is a fun guy,\" said a neighbour. \"He is absolutely horrible,\" said another, reinforcing the impression that nobody really knows who he is.</p> <p>And so the country waits for his next move. On Wednesday, there was a definite shift in tactics, when Bateman donned a pair of glasses and wandered subduedly about the house. His stutter is worsening as the series develops. He is entering the final phase of his plan: the killer bid for sympathy. </p> <p>On Wednesday night's show, the voiceover wrapped up incredulously, \"Nick is now the most popular man in the house,\" and Caroline and Nichola, those two \"brainless rooks\", were captured on the Big Brother sofa, sharing a tender word about him. \"Poor Nick,\" said Caroline. \"He's so delicate.\" Shakespeare himself could not have wrought a better intrigue. Recall Edmund's defiant cry: \"I grow; I prosper: now, gods, stand up for bastards!\"</p>",

  "The British Library has thrown out up to 80,000 books in a change of policy which has brought to an end its 338-year- old role of collecting every volume published in Britain. <p>The library, which under copyright law receives every new book, cleared well over a mile of shelves. The books were chosen and weeded by \"comparatively junior grade professional staff\" to make room for new stock.</p> <p>The new policy, though approved by the library board, has not been publicly announced. </p> <p>Yesterday a library spokesman at first denied that it had been introduced. Later he confirmed it after hearing that a senior staff member had acknowledged its existence in a letter to a scholar. The letter indicated that it had been suspended because of lack of staff to do more weeding. But no assurances could be given that it would not be resumed.</p> <p>The move, which breaks a practice that began in 1662 and made the British Library a near complete historical collection, came to light during inquiries by Keith Armstrong, an author researching a book on the history of disability.</p> <p>Mr Armstrong, who has written or edited four other books, discovered that five books he wanted to read were marked \"discarded\" in the library catalogue.</p> <p>He also found a copy of an important work in his field, by the psychologist Deborah Marks, in a London secondhand bookshop. Though published only last year, it was marked \"British Library - withdrawn\".</p> <p>His protest to the library led to a reply which horrified him, he said yesterday. Richard Cheffins, head of the BL's social policy information service, told him discarding began after the board accepted a 1989 report, headed Selection for Survival, by Brian Enright, librarian of Newcastle University.</p> <p>Dr Enright's report said the steeply rising number of books published meant that the time-honoured policy of storing each one would put an ever-increasing cash burden on the BL and imperil the quality of its collections.</p> <p>Mr Cheffins explained that discarding of low use books began soon after the report was accepted. </p> <p>\"Decisions on a case-by-case basis were made by comparatively junior grade professional staff.</p> <p>\"I am given to understand that, over a couple of years, some 2km of stock in all - about 70,000-80,000 volumes - were withdrawn\", he told Mr Armstrong.</p> <p>\"The space thus freed was filled within a few months with the growth of new stock... You are obviously disturbed that any material, once part of our collections, should have been discarded.<br><br> \"There is not much that can be done about that\".</p> <p>Mr Cheffins added that \"a significant number of about 25 library users a year asked for discarded titles. None of the titles would have been available elsewhere in the country\". Last night a BL spokesman said: \"The discarding of books is an ongoing process.\"</p>",
  "I'm in Kuwait airport. My plane to Jordan should have taken off by now, but it won't be leaving for another two hours and already I'm bored with the book I brought for the flight. There's nothing else to do but play Spot The Hijacker: It's silly, I know, but I can't help it. <p>At any airport in the Middle East you'll find at least a smattering of bearded men with odd-shaped hand baggage who resemble Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Muslim fugitive that is probably the west's most wanted man. I usually discount them, on the grounds that no hijacker would be stupid enough to board a plane looking like that.</p> <p>But perhaps that's unwise. A very smart hijacker might realise that the security people have come to the same conclusion and wave bin-Laden lookalikes through without a second glance. In general, though, I reckon that professional hijackers can be identified because they look abnormally ordinary.</p> <p>The more ordinary, the more reason to be suspicious. Take the Arab man sitting opposite me: medium build, medium height, medium length hair, medium everything. He has absolutely no distinguishing features. He's in his 30s and his clothes are neat but nondescript: dark grey trousers and a blue shirt. Hang on a minute, what's that? There's kind of angular bulge inside his shirt, on the left side, just above the waistline. It might be a Walkman or something but there's no sign of earphones, and anyway, why INSIDE the shirt?</p> <p> I suppose it could be some kind of medical appliance, but he looks healthy. No, there's definitely something strange. He's one for the suspect list - codename: Osama bin Blueshirt. Game over. It's time to board the plane. The airline is Royal Jordanian that, as it happens, had a hijacking only last month. A man on a flight to Damascus demanded to go to Germany but nearly crashed the plane by setting off a grenade and ended up dead.</p> <p>They have given me a window seat at the back and when I get there I find Osama bin Blueshirt already occupying the aisle seat next to it. \"Would you like the window seat?\" I ask. \"No,\" he says firmly and lets me squeeze past.</p> <p>As we settle in for takeoff another passenger is struggling with the overhead locker. Osama stands up to help, and the bulge in the side of his shirt comes almost level with my eyes. What's more, there's a straight, tubular bit about six inches long pointing downwards under his trousers. He's carrying a gun - no doubt about it.</p> <p>Osama sits down again and fastens his seat belt. What can I do, hemmed in by the window? Press the call button? Say: \"Excuse me, do you mind letting me out to have a word with the pilot?\" Osama buries his head in a newspaper. Cunning! And he is so cool. By now, I reckon, most hijackers would be sweating rather a lot and just pretending to read the paper.</p> <p>I watch him, trying not to make it too obvious. He really is reading the paper. He folds it over and spends some time on an article about the Jordanian army. Anyway, it's too late now - we're airborne and in a few minutes Osama bin Blueshirt will be heading for the flight deck, unless\u00c9</p> <p>Reports of the hijacking last month mentioned there were security guards on board who overpowered the man with the grenade. Could Osama be one of them? From his aisle seat at the back, he has a clear view to the front of the plane, and he's sitting on the left, so his right hand is free to pull out the gun and use it, without even leaving his seat.</p> <p>The food arrives and he strikes up a conversation: Where are you from? What do you do? Is it your first visit to Jordan?</p> <p>I ask him if he's ever been to Britain. \"Yes, London, six times,\" he says proudly.</p> <p>\"Holiday or work?\"</p> <p>\"Work.\"</p> <p>\"Do you like London?\" \"I don't know. I stay only one night.\"</p> <p>\"Do you work in security?\" He looks surprised.</p> <p>\"I saw the gun when you stood up,\" I say, pointing to his shirt. Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it. Perhaps he doesn't like to be recognised. But he grins and slaps the palm of my hand, the way that Arab men do when they want to be matey.</p> <p>\"Yes, I work in the army,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Do you fly every day?\" I ask. \"Do you always have this seat?\"</p> <p>He pulls out the newspaper again, signalling that he doesn't want to answer questions. Anyway Osama, thanks for a safe flight. Next time I'm sitting bored in an airport I'll be playing Spot the Security Man.</p>",
  "A Basque politician linked to ETA was arrested after scuffling with the police in Pamplona yesterday as protesters holding a vigil for the separatist movement's latest presumed victim screamed \"murderers\" and \"scum\" at a pro-ETA group across the square. <p>The hundreds gathered outside Pamplona town hall and throughout the Basque region were marking the fatal shooting on Wednesday of Sub-Lieutenant Francisco Casanova.</p> <p>The man arrested in Pamplona was Juan Kruz Aldasoro, a leader of Euskal Herritarrok, which includes Herri Batasuna, regarded as ETA's political wing.</p> <p>The party had been refused permission to hold a rally in memory of four suspected ETA members killed on Monday when the car in which they were driving exploded, but about a dozen of its local leaders gathered nevertheless.<br> AP, Pamplona</p>",
  "The parliamentary commissioner for standards, Elizabeth Filkin, is cracking down on outside speaking engagements by leading MPs such as Charles Kennedy and Michael Portillo because she is determined to prevent speech fees being used to circumvent the rules on members interests. <p>She wants to stop money owed for less innocent services being \"laundered'' as fees for speeches - as happened in Washington DC until the practice was banned.</p> <p>In what looked to some MPs like a tit for tat exchange, Mr Portillo's availibility to speak for up to \u00a35,000 was revealed by a Labour MP days after a Conservative colleague had shone a similar spotlight on Mr Kennedy - who vigorously denied any impropriety.</p> <p>There is no suggestion that the Liberal Democrat leader or the shadow chancellor has done anything wrong in failing to make more explicit declarations of after-dinner speeches. It seems likely they failed to understand what is now expected of them.</p> <p>Nor did the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, nor John Major, the former Tory prime minister, whose speech-making have also fallen foul of Mrs Filkin's investigations this year. In 18 months before he was elected mayor Mr Livinstone earned \u00a3220,992 from speech making, including \u00a3158,000 not included in the members' register.</p> <p>Now any speech which earns an MP more than \u00a3500 should be itemised.</p> <p>Some 208 MPs list \"occasional'' fees for speeches, journalism or broadcasting. All may have to check their records, MPs were advised in June. Some have been slow to respond.</p> <p>\"When in doubt consult and register,'' the independent MP, Martin Bell, said last night. Mrs Filkin, who succeeded Sir Gordon Downey as Westminster's independent watchdog on parliamentary ethics - a byproduct of Lord Nolan's anti-sleaze inquiry - is determined that MPs who make such outside speeches more than three times a year using a professional agency should register their employment agreement and the fee.</p> <p>The reasoning behind the move, which is subject to oversight by the Commons standards and privileges committee, stems from US experience which led to all \"honoraria'' for speeches or guest appearances being banned a decade ago.</p> <p>In a series of cases, including that of Jim Wright of Texas, speaker of the house of representatives, US congressmen were found to be taking fees for speeches which were, in reality, covert payments for consultancies and similar services.</p> <p>In effect, payments were being \"laundered'' despite 20 years of ever-tighter efforts to clean up US politics, which is money-driven because candidates are obliged to buy costly television advertisements.</p> <p>A ban on speaker's fees was therefore imposed, though members of congress are allowed to nominate a charity to which up to $2,000 (around \u00a31,300) can be given, provided the senate or house member does not benefit directly and that the money is not sent to the charity via the politician.</p> <p>Unlike \"cash for questions'' and other unsavoury conduct unearthed at Westminster, no evidence exists for similar tactics being deployed in Britain. But it has made MPs and officials sensitive to the danger.</p> <p>Rules designed to oblige MPs to register outside consultancies also are written so as to require them to register employment agreements with the speakers' agencies who provide after dinner stars.</p> <p>With most MPs away from Westminster, Mrs Filkin has not spoken either to Mr Kennedy or Mr Portillo. But colleagues argued that the speakers' agency was \"acting for me'' in fixing up a speech -rather than the other way round, as when an MP acted in parliament on behalf of a consultancy client.</p> <p>Though most complaints about MPs entries in the register were either incorrect or amicably resolved, the speech issue has caused some anger.</p>",
  "A \u00a3623m air traffic control centre which has already been held back for six years is in danger of being further delayed because 200 computer bugs still plague its software, it emerged yesterday. <p>Three hundred IT experts are racing against the clock to iron out glitches before safety inspectors assess the centre's system at Swanwick, Hampshire, in December this year. Should they fail, the centre, which had an initial budget of \u00a3350m, may have to push back its scheduled opening date of January 2002, causing costs to soar.</p> <p>The extent of the problem was unearthed by the magazine Computer Weekly, which has been a vociferous critic of the centre's system since problems first emerged in 1994. Thousands of bugs were initially uncovered, with 1,400 still existing in 1999, and 500 in May this year. Tony Collins, an executive editor at the magazine, said there was now a low to medium risk that the centre - due to control most of the airspace above England and Wales - would not open on schedule.</p> <p>\"Any one of these bugs that affects safety has the potential to delay the programme because Nats [the national air traffic services, which control Britain's airspace] won't compromise on safety,\" he said.</p> <p>\"On a positive note, they have cleared up many of the problems, but to some extent the bugs they have identified are less serious than the ones they haven't yet identified. This is a piece of software with 2m lines of code and there are still some upgrades of software they need to do. With a system of this size, there could still be huge problems.\"</p> <p>Faults have included a problem with communication links between Swanwick and the ageing London air traffic control centre at West Drayton, most of whose work it will take over. There has also been a big problem involving back-up power supplies that would keep Swanwick's 200 controller work stations running in an emergency. </p> <p>In tests, up to 60% of the work stations failed instead of the anticipated 25%. </p> <p>\"That was an unacceptably high failure rate,\" admitted Richard Wright, a spokesman for Nats. \"But we have acquired an additional, fifth, power supply, to preserve the level of service.\"</p> <p>Nats, which is expected to be partly privatised before the Swanwick centre is opened, last night said that it was confident that it would meet its technical handover date in December, when the system will be ready for air traffic controllers to spend a year training.</p> <p>\"There's still a lot to do but the fact that we're down to this number of so-called bugs now is extremely good news for us\", said its chief executive, Bill Semple.</p> <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he insisted that no bugs would affect its operation. </p> <p>\"I can absolutely assure anybody... that there will be no compromises made that will impact on safety. If there are any doubts on that account I can assure you that I will not take this system into operation,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Leylandii, the fastest growing, most numerous and most hated tree in Britain, is finally to be called to account for the mayhem it has caused in suburbia. Council chain saw hit squads are to be given the power to enter gardens and cut problem hedges down to size, bringing relief to many an overshadowed home.</p> <p>Yesterday the environment minister, Michael Meacher, announced new legislation to curb the cupressocyparis leylandii which, he says, has, more than any other issue, filled his postbag since the general election with \"thousands of ruined lives, many legal battles and even violence\". </p> <p>Following a public consultation begun last year, an astonishing 97% of the public wanted the government to sort out leylandii - 94% supporting the idea of legislation to allow them to be compulsorily cut down.</p> <p>Nearly eight out of 10 local authorities, exhausted by fruitless efforts to sort out disputes between neighbours, wanted the power to act unilaterally if hedge owners would not cooperate.</p> <p>The ubiquitous plant, once praised for its robust constitution and ability to set roots down virtually anywhere, has been the culprit in numerous court cases pitting neighbour against neighbour.</p> <p>It has even spurred a police manhunt for a bizarre arsonist who has been targeting gardens in Leeds suburbs where the offending trees have been set on fire in the dead of night. Never in the history of gardening has a single plant caused so much trouble - or a Latin name so readily entered the English language.</p> <p>The tree, an accidental hybrid between two unrelated fir trees from North America which occurred on the estate of the collector C J Leyland in 1888, was once thought a boon for gardeners. They were marketed as graceful but \"flourishing in any soil, standing up to fierce winds, free of pests and disease, and growing like rockets\".</p> <p>It was this last trait that has caused the trouble. Some varieties of leylandii grow readily 3ft a year. From a tiny start in the 1960s when nurseries learned to propagate the tree easily, there are now an estimated 55m in Britain and around 300,000 are sold every year.</p> <p>Because the trees are still relatively young, no one knows how high they might grow but one in Kent is already 150ft and hedges of 60 to 70ft are frequent.</p> <p>The most celebrated legal battle involving the tree lasted seven years, cost \u00a3100,000, and reached the court of appeal. It involved Michael Jones and his neighbour Bernard Standon of Bournville in Birmingham, who quarrelled over a 35ft leylandii hedge which Mr Jones had leaned over and trimmed by 9ft. </p> <p>Mr Jones won his case because of local covenants on the estate in Birmingham which prevent nuisance to neighbours but dozens of other cases have been lost on the basis that an Englishman can do what he likes in his own garden. Many people have been fined for criminal damage for taking unilateral action like Mr Jones, because they were not protected by covenant. Mr Jones founded Hedgeline to help them. The organisation, which has 3,000 members whose lives have become dominated by disputes over out of control boundary hedges, has been campaigning for a change in the law.</p> <p>Two years ago the group took its case to Downing Street. Like the avenging army of Malcolm approaching Macbeth it hid its numbers under branches of leylandii but left the government in no doubt about the strength of feeling.</p> <p>Mr Meacher knows the weight of his postbag. \"This has caused huge feeling. A vote of 97% in favour of action on any issue does not happen outside the Kremlin normally. \"There are tens of thousands of cases of private disputes between neighbours. There is a depth of anger and misery which high hedges cause which cannot be overstated - this show of public opinion proves it.\"</p> <p>He said that there would be no prescribed height limit for hedges. In some cases to shield houses from wind or traffic nuisance a high hedge could be justified but in small suburban gardens matters were different. \"It will not be hard for local authorities used to dealing with planning matters to sort this out. Mediation is the best answer but in the last resort the councils must have the power to physically intervene, and that means sending in the chain saws.\" Mr Jones said: \"We are delighted to have a firm pledge that this nuisance will be finally dealt with. There are a lot of hedge victims out there who need urgent help.\"</p> <p>He urged the government to support the private member's bill currently before the House of Lords, which would give local authorities the power to intervene in hedge disputes, and Mr Meacher said yesterday that he would consider it.</p> <p>Clare Hinchcliffe, a Hedgeline organiser, compiles case histories of violence and court cases. She said: \"Many of our members are old ladies and timid people bullied by monster hedges which cut the light out of their homes and their gardens and dominate their lives. They suffer years of anxiety as the hedges grow bigger and bigger and they are powerless to do anything about it.</p> <p>\"If at last they can get relief by appealing to the local authority to mediate and if that does not work to apply compulsion that is wonderful news. Let us hope it comes soon.\"</p> <p><strong>A growing history of trouble</strong></p> <p>\u0095 John Gibbons from Sunderland is still paying \u00a340 a month out of his pension after being fined \u00a32,000 for cutting a few branches from his neighbour's leylandii two years ago. He made a dent in it at the time, he says, but it is still growing and its 18ft height in winter blocks the sunlight from his home. His wife Aline said: \"The magistrates did not even come and look. Next door has a garden the size of a football pitch and the trees are miles away from their house. Our house is only 15ft away and the garden is so much in the shade no sunlight penetrates. There has been nothing we can do about it, but it is an injustice.\"</p> <p>\u0095 A keen gardener appeared in court yesterday charged with the murder of his next door neighbour. Llandis Burdon, 56, was shot in his own home after an alleged dispute over a 6ft- conifer hedge. His neighbour Uri Bowen, 61, was charged with the murder of Mr Burdon, a retired environment agency official. The two men were neighbours in Station Road, in Talybont-on-Usk, near Brecon, Powys, for more than 20 years. </p> <p>\u0095 At least six leylandii blazes in the Bramley area of Leeds in one month last December were begun with lighted newspaper, probably sprinkled with lighter fuel. Leading firefighter Nigel Kitchingman, of West Yorkshire fire brigade, said at the time: \"We think someone has a vendetta against the trees and is determined to get rid of them.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Retired postman Phil Bodenham, 79, lost his life savings - some \u00a315,000 - after trimming leylandii branches which he felt encroached on his garden at Cliffords Mesne, Gloucestershire. He was alleged by neighbour Alan Barnard to have cut off six inches two much, taken to court, fined \u00a3200 in damages and ordered to pay \u00a315,000 costs. </p> <p>\u0095 George Whitmill was hit with a bucket of water and a shotgun was fired in Hopwood Green, Newbury, Berkshire, in May this year after a dispute broke out as Mr Whitmill attempted to trim a neighbouring hedge. A man was questioned over the shotgun discharge.</p>",
  "Two convicted child molesters escaped jail yesterday as judges distanced themselves from anti-paedophile protests prompted by the News of the World's name and shame campaign. <br>  In Manchester, a former teacher already named by the paper was given a suspended sentence after being convicted of sex offences against a former pupil. The judge ruled that he was a \"marked man\" who had already suffered \"considerable adverse publicity''. <p>In Newcastle, an 82-year-old Dunkirk veteran who put his hand down the trousers of a nine-year-old girl was placed on probation for two years by a judge who said that it was \"punishment itself'' that he had been forced to move away from his home.</p> <p>The sentences were passed as campaigners in Portsmouth halted their protests after driving out a fifth family from the Paulsgrove estate at the end of a week of night marches which had ended in violence.</p> <p>Following a meeting with Portsmouth city council and police, the protesters agreed to show the authorities their list of 20 alleged paedophiles they believe are living on the Paulsgrove estate. Roger Ching, the council's acting chief executive, said it was \"a significant move forward and a very positive step. We have repeated our offer to move anyone who feels threatened to a place of safety during this period of tension. We have also agreed to meet again on Monday to reassess the situation.\"</p> <p>Last night Sara Payne, whose daughter Sarah was found murdered last month, appealed for an end to the violent demonstrations, saying \"we won't change the law if this goes on''. Meanwhile Raymond Cullens, 51, was given a 15-month suspended jail sentence at Manchester crown court after being found guilty of four indecent assaults and three charges of indecency with a child. He had been jailed for 30 months in 1992 for indecently assaulting three pupils at a school in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, but was arrested again last year when a fourth victim contacted police.</p> <p>Cullens's name and photograph featured in the second week of the News of the World's campaign but Judge Stuart Fish did not refer directly to the newspaper as he passed sentence. He told Cullens, who was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for 10 years, that he had taken into account the fact the offences had been committed at the same time as others for which he had already been jailed.</p> <p>\"I add to it the fact, I was going to say, [that] you are a marked man,'' said the judge. \"That is a little over the top. But you and your family have suffered considerable adverse publicity, although of course it has to be said you are the author of your own misfortune in that respect.''</p> <p>After the case, Kim Hawksworth, 22, who gave evidence of how she was abused by Cullens when aged eight, described the sentence as \"absolutely disgraceful.</p> <p>\"I have spent 14 years serving this sentence and he walks out of court,'' she said after waiving her right to anonymity. \"I think naming and shaming paedophiles is a brilliant campaign and every parent should have the right to know if a paedophile is living in their area.\"</p> <p>In Newcastle, Charles Varnham, was placed on probation for two years after admitting indecently assaulting a nine-year-old girl at his home in Embleton, Northumberland.</p> <p>\"You have a proud history as a soldier and you have thrown away your good reputation with this offence,'' said judge David Wood. \"The girl may not recover from this for a long time, if at all and usually people go to prison for this offending. </p> <p>\"You will be 83 this Sunday and have never been in trouble before. You have lost your home because you will not be permitted to go back to Embleton and will have to find a new life somewhere else and that seems punishment itself.\"</p> <p>The suspension of the Portsmouth marches marks a change of heart by protesters, who had previously said they would not stop until all paedophiles on their list, compiled in part from the News of the World reports, had been forced out.</p> <p> Last night a family told of their horror at returning home from holiday in Spain to find their car a burnt out wreck and their home ransacked. Julie and Gary Legge said they had no idea why anti-paedophile protesters targeted their home next door to that of local MP Syd Rapson.</p>",
  "<p>Kim Tan, Britain's wealthiest biotech entrepreneur, rushed out a statement yesterday denying reports that he was selling his \u00a3200m stake in KS Biomedix - the drug development company he has built around the use of sheep antibodies.</p> <p> The Malaysian-born businessman insisted there was no truth in suggestions that he had found a buyer willing to pay \u00a310 a share for his 64% stake. The news sent the shares down 15p to 645p. There is little reason to give credence to the rumours. Dr Tan is notoriously frugal - despite a paper fortune of more than \u00a3350m, he still potters around Surrey in an eight-year-old Volkswagen Golf. He is unlikely to have a sudden yearning for cash.</p> <p> The tittle-tattle has probably been triggered by his recent decision to become non-executive chairman, giving up day to day control. This has certainly spooked some analysts, who point out that the company's technology is largely his personal work. KS Biomedix's science is promising. It takes sheep and injects them with antigens - which produce disease- attacking antibodies. The company has found that antibodies from the animals are much more selective, and better able to bind with cancer tumours, than antibodies produced by human beings or by mice. This delivery technique could have huge potential for future cancer treatments but is still in its infancy.</p> <p> KS Biomedix has two more advanced products, both for arthritis, which have completed phase two clinical trials. Enthusiasm about the company has become a little excessive. The shares have seen a sixfold rise in two years, valuing the business at \u00a3313m. The company could make a profit for the first time this year if it can find development partners willing to make up-front payments. However, serious revenue is a good few years away and as sheep antibodies are an unproven technology, the valuation is too high.</p>",
  "The Polish president, Aleksander Kwasniewski, was cleared by a Warsaw court yesterday of collaborating with the old communist regime's secret police, ending a two-week trial which could have prevented him standing for re-election. <p>The trial resulted from a law which demands that officials declare past links to the secret police. But when the charismatic president was called to the dock after potentially incriminating documents came to light, many said the law had gone too far.</p> <p>A special vetting court was called to deliver its verdict on documents which claimed that Mr Kwasniewski, a former journalist, was agent 72204, codenamed \"Alek\", who worked at the newspaper Zycie Warszawy. </p> <p>Mr Kwasniewski, a former sports minister, has had to fight to clear his name at the same time as his political rival, Lech Walesa. </p> <p>The former president and founder of the anti-communist movement, Solidarity, is being accused of collaborating with the secret police (SB). Mr Walesa, who is also running in October's elections, faces a verdict on his court case today. </p> <p>But both Mr Walesa and Mr Kwasniewski, who enjoys almost 80% support, claim that political opponents are attempting to smear them in the run up to the elections. </p> <p>Witnesses at the trial, most of whom were former SB agents, all denied that Mr Kwasniewski had collaborated. After the verdict Mr Kwasniewski appeared strained but relieved. </p> <p>\"I'm very glad,\" he said. \"Truth and justice has won.\" But he warned that he would pursue those responsible for \"manipulating the evidence\".</p>",
  "Hungary's first legal open-air brothel opened yesterday in woodland next to the Formula 1 race track outside Budapest: a row of 20 hardboard booths, each with a red carpet, a bed covered with a grey blanket, and a neat stack of four toilet rolls. At the end of the row are portable toilets and showers. <p>The sign outside says \"Erotik Camping\". Officially it is a \"tolerance zone\". </p> <p>The anti-mafia law passed by the Hungarian parliament in December instructs local authorities to declare red-light areas wherever \"mass prostitution\" exists. </p> <p>The village council of Mogyorod, nine miles from Budapest, is the first to take advantage of it, albeit only for the five days of the race meeting. </p> <p>A quarter of a million visitors are expected, more than half of them foreigners. Estimates of the number of prostitutes on hand range from 100 to 500.</p> <p>As 4pm approached there was a tense atmosphere at the entrance to the site. Well-built young men in black T-shirts and dark glasses from a security firm called Iron Dwarf tried to bustle a crowd of journalists from the scene. </p> <p>Out of nowhere a line of girls with variously coloured shoulder-length hair, wearing pedal pushers or short skirts, was marshalled into the area by more men with mobile phones.</p> <p>On the hour a woman stretched a tricoloured Hungarian ribbon across the entrance. But there were no scissors, no official opening and, for the first hour at least, no clients either.</p> <p>\"To tell you the truth this is not what they led us to expect,\" said a 21-year-old girl from Budapest, who explained that she normally worked as \"a model\" in Budapest. </p> <p>She wore a long black skirt, a white T-shirt, and golden earrings, and her brown eyes looked deeply vulnerable. </p> <p>\"I thought I would come for fun, for a joke. I used to think I enjoyed this work, but now I'm not sure.\"</p> <p>A session in a booth would cost 300 German marks (\u00a3100), she said. \"We were expecting normal surroundings, and normal people. We all feel desperate.\"</p> <p>The mayor's office in Mogyorod is a single storey, pale yellow 19th-century building with a gateway through which horses would once have driven with their carriages. </p> <p>The mayor, Sandor Toth, used to be a member of the Independent Smallholders party, but won the post in 1998 as an independent.</p> <p>\"People here do not fear the grand prix,\" he said, \"they look forward to it - as to the silence which follows.\"</p> <p>The idea of the tolerance zone came originally from the interior ministry in Budapest, he said. In past years open prostitution in the streets and alleys of the village had grown to scandalous proportions. </p> <p>To deal with it the local police proposed, and his council accepted by 10 votes to two, the idea of putting aside 1.6 hectares (4 acres) of young acacia forest bordering the track. </p> <p>Budapest entrepreneurs rapidly appeared to lay on the booths - and the girls.</p> <p>Most local people appear to be in favour. </p> <p>\"The zone is a necessary evil,\" said Erzsebet Juhasz, 49, an accountant, who lives on the main street. She has 17 visitors - mostly Dutch - camping in her garden or staying in her house. In previous years the prostitutes annoyed her guests, so she supports the new arrangement.</p> <p> \"I'm against all prostitution,\" said another woman, with a \"rooms to let\" sign near the main gate. \"But I'm glad they've put them all away this year, out of sight.\"</p>",
  "<p>The world's top financial authority, the International Monetary Fund, yesterday urged the Irish government to tighten fiscal policy to prevent its booming economy from overheating. While praising the country's \"spectacular economic performance\" and acknowledging that membership of the eurozone conveyed \"permanent economic benefits\", the IMF said there was a short-term danger that average growth of around 8% a year since 1994 would lead to higher inflation.</p> <p> Given that interest rates, now set on a euro area-wide basis, were too low for the country's cyclical position, the Washington-based organisation called on Bertie Ahern's government to use alternative instruments to damp down demand. These included tightening fiscal policy, ensuring public sector pay deals were strictly adhered to and doing more to restrain the run-away property market. </p> <p>The fund's report had been keenly awaited in the UK, where Ireland's experience inside the eurozone is seen as a test case for Britain's membership. While sceptics say the country's plight points to the folly of surrendering control of monetary policy to the European central bank, europhiles say membership of the eurozone has been a key ingredient in Ireland's economic success. The IMF, which said that full membership of the single European market had been key to attracting foreign investment and promoting efficiency, appears to provide ammunition for both sides of the debate. </p> <p>Kitty Ussher, chief economist of Britain in Europe, the pro-EMU lobby group, said the IMF report exploded the myth that Ireland was a failing economy. She said: \"The anti-Europeans in Britain should accept the truth about Ireland rather than attempting to misrepresent it for their own ideological purposes.\" Nick Herbert, chief executive of Business for Sterling, the anti-EMU lobby group, said: \"The report does point to the dangers of losing control of your own interest rates. That plainly has contributed to the inflation problem in Ireland and Britain would be in a very uncomfortable position had it joined EMU last year.\"</p>",

  "The Reform party began its convention in Long Beach yesterday in the middle of a battle for the presidential nomination that could end in court, as two factions battle for control of the US's most successful third party in decades. <p>The farcical situation is the result of a split between supporters of Pat Buchanan, the rightwing former Republican who only joined the party last autumn, and those who accuse the 'Buchanan Brigaders' of hijacking the movement set up by the Texas millionaire, Ross Perot.</p> <p>Mr Buchanan's supporters were claiming victory yesterday, saying they had the backing of 410 of the 600 delegates. Mr Buchanan claimed that \"these little tiffs, these disputes, will be behind us by Sunday\".</p> <p>But as delegates arrived in Long Beach yesterday, they found two separate tables set up by rival committees. Each faction held its own press conference, claiming to be the \"real\" Reform party.</p> <p>Police were standing by outside as proceedings began. On Tuesday afternoon they had to intervene when the party's national committee split into factions and there were scuffles and screaming matches in the convention hotel. </p> <p>The Buchanan supporters were called \"stormtroopers\" and \"brownshirts\" by their opponents, who claim that Mr Buchanan's extreme conservatism misrepresents the party and will lose them their support among libertarians. </p> <p>Mr Buchanan, 61, a former Nixon speechwriter, has the backing of the party chairman, Gerry Moan, which gives him the upper hand when it comes to controlling the convention and securing $12.5m (\u00a38.3m) in federal campaign funds. If Mr Buchanan claims the money, his opponents say, they will go to court.</p> <p>Jim Mangia, the party secretary who has been leading the anti-Buchanan faction, said: \"The party is united together against Pat Buchanan\" whom he accused of being \"corrupt\" in the way he has pursued the nomination.</p> <p>The anti-Buchanan faction supports an Iowa physicist, John Hagelin, who is also the Natural Law party's candidate.</p> <p>The row has highlighted the way the party's fortunes have slumped since 1992, when Mr Perot took 19% of the vote and was credited with helping Bill Clinton beat George Bush. </p> <p>The latest polls show Mr Buchanan has around 2% of the vote. With the Green party's Ralph Nader polling at around 8% nationally, the Reform party may have already lost its claim to be the third party alternative. </p> <p>The split may help George W Bush who had feared that Mr Buchanan might lure away conservative Republicans unhappy with the idea of \"compassionate conservatism\".</p>",
  "<p>Stuart Neame is a very angry brewer. The deputy chairman of Shepherd Neame, the Kent real ale specialist, is waging a highly personal war on the great British pastime of \"booze cruising\".</p> <p>A dapper, Rugby-educated 54-year-old, Neame is an unlikely crusader. However, he is deeply worried that his family business is under threat - the cross-Channel drinks trade is wrecking trade at Shepherd Neame's south-eastern pubs. </p> <p>Neame has a taste for confrontation - he likes to meet the enemy face-to-face on \"reconnaissance\" visits to the cavernous, cut-price drinks warehouses of Calais. He invited the Guardian on one of his regular excursions to France, in an attempt to expose the organised world of the \"white van men\".</p> <p>Standing in the morning sunshine in the car park of Dover's Eastern Docks, Neame looks around furtively. He is watching for suspects. \"They don't use white vans any more,\" he says. \"They became too conspicuous, so the professionals switched to coloured vans. Customs are on to that too, though, so most these days use open-backed trucks or estate cars.\" A few battered Toyota Landcruisers attract his attention but he concedes that 10am is hardly peak time for smugglers, most of whom cross at night. An hour later, Neame is snuggling into a sofa in the executive lounge of one of P&amp;O's ferries. The lounge is almost empty - few business travellers use the ferries these days - but Neame dislikes mixing with the shell-suited masses on his reconnaisance missions. Sipping a complimentary coffee, he outlines his case: \"Our Kent pubs have lost a quarter of their business because of imported beer from Calais. Traditional farmworkers and locals used to go to the pub five or six times a week. Now they have a stock of cheap beer at home and drink it in front of the television.\"</p> <p>The law allows travellers within the European Union to bring back as many drinks as they like for personal consumption. A benchmark has been set, however, of 110 litres of beer, or 90 litres of wine. Above that level, Customs can ask questions - and the easiest way to answer them is to prove that you are having a party. Neame says it is common practice for the professionals to make fake bookings for \"wedding parties\" at church halls, to show customs as evidence that their hoards are for personal use. \"It's incredible, the lengths they go to,\" he says.</p> <p>Arriving in Calais, the first stop is EastEnders - one of the largest and best known of the Calais booze emporiums. Located on the town's ringroad, EastEnders is the size of an aircraft hangar, with sawdust on the floor and forklift trucks shuttling around crates of lager. EastEnders is owned by Dave West, a burly character who styles himself as the consumer's champion against rip-off Britain. Neame and West make an odd couple and there is obvious tension between them - West is in the process of suing Shepherd Neame, which is trying to stop him selling its beer. \"I'm a firm believer that duty should be put down,\" says West. \"I'm doing all I can to ensure people break the law - like they did with the poll tax.\" West's top selling lines include crates of cheap French wine packaged as \"The Dog's Bollocks\". He has just branched out into washing powder - Persil, apparently, is much cheaper in France than in Britain. \"I'm after a knighthood,\" announces West. \"Freddie Laker got a knighthood for getting air fares down. I'm doing what I can to get taxes down.\"</p> <p> Neame is unimpressed, and the pair launch into a debate in the middle of the shop floor. West says: \"You'd do more by selling your beers in Calais than by launching a \u00a36m advertising campaign. You're a little old country brewer and you'd have products all over the country if you let us sell them.\" Customers push trolleys around the warehouse with tottering stacks of boxes, containing enough booze for a royal wedding. So, does West really believe his customers are buying purely for personal consumption? His response is to walk up to a woman wheeling a tottering stack of 400 bottles of lager through the checkout, and demand: \"Are you going to drink all that, love?\" \"Of course,\" she replies, with the usual line: \"I'm having a huge party.\" </p> <p>Outside EastEnders, two men are loading up a brand new car. Robert, a decorators' merchant, and Dave, a retired firemen, are on the continent for two days. They have bought a car, a crateload of cigarettes from Belgium (the tobacco trade is far more liberal there than in France) and a boot-load of wine. \"A job well done,\" they conclude - their total saving runs to several thousand of pounds. Next stop is Tesco - a store little more than the size of two tennis courts in one of Calais' out-of-town shopping arcades. The manager, Matt Collins, is described as \"president directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral of Tesco France\" - although his responsibilities amount to one store. Collins says business has surged since the introduction of a new Eurotunnel offer - vehicles travelling to Calais after 6pm pay just \u00a312 for a return ticket. Hardened alcohol traffickers have been known to travel there and back three times a night. On its best day, Tesco's Calais store clocked up sales of \u00a3560,000 and typically the shop accounts for about 15% of the Tesco group's entire revenue from wines and spirits. Collins reckons that means the store supplies nearly 4% of all the wines and spirits consumed in Britain. </p> <p>So how does he feel about putting Shepherd Neame's pubs out of business? \"If it's keeping people home from the pub, then personally I would feel maybe a little bit guilty. But business is business.\" Collins says Tesco does what it can to put off professional traffickers, who are likely to sell on their purchases. One customer asked for 40 cases of Bacardi, which the store supplied. But when the same man returned the following week for another 40 cases, Collins refused. \"Morally, I won't sell in that kind of situation,\" he says.</p> <p> Leaving Tesco, Neame follows a home-made sign off the ringroad to another booze warehouse. This one is located down a dirt track, just outside a tatty village, and the prices are even lower. The place is clearly not aimed at holidaymakers - it consists of several warehouses large enough for lorries to enter, and the prices are given in crates, rather than bottles. We are watched suspiciously by staff as we wander around. The brewers are fighting back; the Independent Family Brewers of Britain organises regular watches of Dover docks, to look out for overloaded cars and vans sagging unusually low over their wheels. Neame says accidents are common because some drivers adjust the suspension from their vehicles to fit more booze in, making them more difficult to steer.</p> <p> However, the problem is not going to disappear. Customs reckons \u00a3215m of revenue was lost to Britain through alcohol smuggling last year. The future looks bright for EastEnders. </p> <p> <strong>In the van of the battle</strong> On the front line in the war against smugglers are several thousand \"excise verification officers\", customs officials with the task of stopping and searching suspicious vehicles. They can only hope to make a modest impact: they are pitched against an estimated 27,000 people involved in smuggling. Of the 1.4m pints of beer brought across the Channel every day, 75% is destined for illegal resale. A customs spokeswoman says: \"Our job is to pull people over, question them and try to establish whether their hoards are for personal use.\" If vehicles are carrying more than the \"statutory limit\" of 800 cigarettes and 110 litres of beer, drivers will be asked for evidence that they are planning a party or special event. Customs keeps an eye out for vans which have been across the Channel several times a day. </p> <p>The thin blue line was strengthened recently by more money from the Treasury. The March Budget committed \u00a3209m for recruitment of 1,000 officers. Overseeing all is the former Barclays Bank chief Martin Taylor, the government's unofficial \"smuggling tsar\". Measures to deter smuggling are increasingly imaginative. One recent initiative was to punish newsagents selling bootleg beer and tobacco by taking away their National Lottery machines, often the most lucrative part of their business. </p> <p>The chase extends beyond Channel ports. The Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association reckons about 15% of white vans head straight for the Midlands, with 4,000 a year targeting Birmingham. It has hired private invest- igators to carry out covert surveillance, to prove to the Treasury that the problem is greater than official figures suggest.</p>",

  "<p>The bidding war for Hyder, the Welsh multi-utility, will go down to the wire later today after the takeover panel last night insisted the two rivals, Japanese bank Nomura and US group Western Power Distribution, submit final sealed bids. </p> <p>It is the first time the panel has used this procedure in a takeover battle. It is understood that the rivals have until 1pm to put in their bids and the winner will be declared at or around the closing of the market at 4.30pm. Nomura, with its third offer of 360p a share or \u00a3557m, edged in front this week of WPD which had put in a \u00a3526m offer recommended by the embattled Hyder board. But, with shares in the debt-ridden Welsh group closing at 384p, analysts expect an offer of around 400p to win the day.</p> <p>Sources close to the deal said Nomura was unimpressed by the move. The Japanese bank did not think the procedure was the \"right way\" to conclude the battle for Hyder and was \"wholly inappropriate\" for Wales' biggest plc. The panel said it was intervening in order to allow the bidding war to come to an orderly conclusion today, the last day for bids under its rules. Though it refused to divulge details it was likened to an auction.</p> <p>Some two years ago the full panel imposed the same procedure in the battle for control of the Energy Group, including Eastern Electricity, between rival American bidders Texas Utilities and PacifiCorp. But the procedure lapsed when PacifiCorp withdrew at the last minute. Neither bidder for Hyder, which owns Welsh Water, the Swalec electricity distribution business and a business services and infrastructure divisions, has so far indicated a willingness to drop out. Nomura entered the lists at 260p, a substantial premium on the 189.25p price of Hyder on March 27, the day before Wales's biggest plc said it was in talks with other groups about its future. But subsequent bids have pushed the offer price to 360p.</p> <p>The Japanese bank has won political and union backing for its approach because it has promised to keep the group, which has debts of \u00a31.6bn, intact and retain Welsh Water for five years and Swalec for at least three years.</p>",
  "Victor Burnett is terrified. He does not expect sympathy for his predicament, nor forgiveness for his crimes. He does not expect people to understand why he was sexually attracted to boys as young as eleven - \"I thought it was natural\" - or how he managed to abuse so many without feeling the slightest remorse. <p>But as a serial paedophile, and the man at the centre of the \"name and shame\" furore in Portsmouth, he believes his voice must be heard before untold damage is done.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Burnett, 55, said the \"mindless, stupid vigilantes\" who had terrorised him out of his home were driving scores of paedophiles underground.</p> <p>\"When the police know where the offenders are there is some measure of control, but if they go underground, the authorities will never see or hear from them. Not until they offend again, that is. </p> <p>\"Paedophiles who disappear from one estate will turn up on another. To say the vigilantes are behaving like animals would be unfair to animals.</p> <p>\"What do they really hope to achieve? If they lynched me, what good would that do? This is the madness of the mob.\"</p> <p>Burnett has been in hiding since last Friday, when the police escorted him out of his flat on the Paulsgrove estate, in north Portsmouth, hours before a demonstration which erupted into violence.</p> <p>Since then, he has considered suicide. He believes he will be killed if the mob ever discovers his whereabouts.</p> <p>\"I've had death threat phone calls. One woman left a message saying 'I'm going to cut you up and give the bits to the kids... sex case, sex case, hang him, hang him'.\"</p> <p>Although Burnett admits he was responsible for \"terrible, terrible\" abuses, he insists he has not reoffended since he was released from Maidstone prison six years ago and that, through extensive sexual therapy, he has \"taught\" himself not to be aroused by children.</p> <p>Like many paedophiles, he was abused as a child. He was eight and the paedophile was a Franciscan monk who taught at his boarding school.</p> <p>\"I was a bit confused, but it didn't hurt and, to be honest, I ended up enjoying it. The relationship lasted for five years and I had sex with other boys as well, which also seemed natural. I thought it was quite normal. For me, it was always boys, never girls.\"</p> <p>He added: \"As I went through puberty and adolescence, my body changed but my taste in boys did not. I grew up, but my sexual preference stayed the same.\"</p> <p>Burnett has spent 14 and a half years in jail for sex offences since he was 16, and admits he has abused up to 40 children, aged between 11 and 15.</p> <p>Electric shock treatment did not stop him from offending.</p> <p>\"I also took a course of women's hormones. All that does is make your breasts grow and increase your sexual frustration.</p> <p>\"Nothing worked. At the time nobody could have have convinced me I was doing wrong. I thought, they are enjoying it and I am enjoying it, so how can that be wrong?</p> <p>\"I didn't think of the children as sex objects, I thought of them as friends. And if a child didn't want to have sex, I would stop. I wanted them to enjoy themselves, not have a bad experience.\"<br><br> Burnett says he did not find his victims by \"hanging round parks, public toilets or public swimming pools\". His modus operandi was, he concedes, in many ways worse. \"All the children I was involved with were friends of people I knew. Getting to know a boy could take months, it could take years. If a boy didn't want to have sex, I wouldn't force him. I wasn't violent, good God, no.\"</p> <p>It took two and a half years of sex therapy with a psychiatrist at Maidstone prison in the early 1990s to make Burnett realise the harm he was doing.</p> <p>\"She made me write down every sexual experience I had ever had, from the first to the last. \"I was made to remember horrible experiences that I had had as a child. Then she took me through all the things I had done to children. I began to realise the impact I had had on those kids.</p> <p>\"One still looks, but in the past I used to think, yes, I'd like to. But not now. I don't see children as sex objects. I see them as vulnerable children.</p> <p>\"After I had been shown the pain I had caused, I began to understand what I was doing was wrong. When I see children now I do not get aroused. I think how the hell could I put a kid through that again.</p> <p>\"Being a paedophile is not a weakness, it is part of you, it's always there.</p> <p>\"I have been teaching myself to go with older people. You have to programme yourself to say no. I will always be a gay man. But as far as the underage sex is concerned, I now know it's wrong. When the News of the World said I was on the verge of reoffending, they were talking rubbish. There have been no boys since I left prison. I have been clean.\"</p> <p>Burnett has met two of his victims in recent years. One rang him and asked: \"Do you remember me?\"</p> <p>\"He said the word chimney, which is one I had taught him. He asked to meet me outside a pub in Middlesex. It was an emotional experience. I wondered if he would get violent, but he didn't. He said 'if you promise never to do it again, I will remain friends with you.</p> <p>\"This man is still seeing a psychiatrist and is on medication. His wife doesn't know he came to see me. I don't know if she knows anything about me.</p> <p>\"I feel very, very guilty. I said to myself, 'look what you have done'.\"</p> <p>Burnett thinks the News of the World should be prosecuted for inciting violence. He blames the newspaper for the suicide of two alleged paedophiles, and for ruining what chance he had of breaking away from the past.</p> <p>Burnett has two sons, but has not seen them in years.</p> <p>\"One is 25 and he has a degree. I hope my ex-wife hasn't told him who his father is.</p> <p>\"I went to Portsmouth to get away, to start again.

  "The Ministry of Defence faces the prospect of unprecedented legal action to force it to remove a damaged nuclear-powered submarine from Gibraltar. <p>Its decision to try to repair HMS Tireless, which has been tied up since May 19 in full view of populated areas, has provoked protest in the British overseas territory.</p> <p>Though the ministry yesterday dismissed the submarine's problem as a \"minor defect\", sources with direct knowledge of the leak from the nuclear reactor describe it as serious.</p> <p>They say the fault is located above valves controlling pressure to the submarine's steam generators and is close to the reactor itself. </p> <p>\"The problem cannot be isolated,\" said one source, who declined to be identified. HMS Tireless limped into Gibraltar after radioactive coolant started leaking from the reactor when on patrol in the Mediterranean. </p> <p>In an indication of the gravity of the problem, the MoD has decided not to try to tow the submarine back to Britain. The defect is said to be the first of its kind in Britain's fleet of nuclear-powered submarines.</p> <p>The ministry said yesterday that it was examining results of an inspection by the defence nuclear safety committee.

  "When you live in the same house as Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, said recently, be prepared for surprises. Needless to say, Milosevic's surprises are always unpleasant, as Djukanovic found when the Serbian leader earlier this summer rigged the constitution to allow himself two more potential terms as president of rump Yugoslavia and to demote Montenegro in the changed federal institutions. <p>Among others also recently surprised by Milosevic are the unfortunate Britons and Canadians picked up this month on the border between Kosovo and Montenegro and now before a military court in Belgrade. The two surprises are connected. The four foreigners have been assigned bit parts in a drama of encirclement staged by Milosevic, a drama in which Djukanovic has one of the larger roles. The ruthless survivor in Belgrade has created in Serbia an atmosphere of paranoia that is even more irrational than that which prevailed 10 years ago as Yugoslavia's wars were germinating. Serbia is under constant attack, he gives his nation to understand, just as he himself, as their leader, is physically threatened. </p> <p>In Milosevic's world, teams of assassins are paid by the French to kill him and his associates, Serbian journalists operate as covert agents for the west, and the neighbouring republic of Montenegro is swarming with traitors, foreign spies, mercenaries, and British SAS men. Serbs may not altogether believe in this picture of the unrelenting hostility of most of the outside world, but it nevertheless plays to their vulnerabilities.</p> <p> \"Their fears,\" a recent report by a Bulgarian institute concluded, \"are... for their biological survival because of the collapse of the health system, of environmental pollution and radiation after the air raids, of civil war, of political repression, of isolation.\" Again and again the investigators were told that the nation is \"sinking to the bottom\". The report suggests that both the educated elite and ordinary people are involved in a process of self-examination leading in many cases to deep regret over the events of the last decade and to a repudiation of Milosevic. That regret does not rule out, of course, blaming the Nato countries as well as Milosevic. </p> <p>The irony is that people are so cast down that many still respond to his politicking, even while knowing or half-knowing that he is both responsible for their ills and has no solution to them. Life in Serbia, with its frequent assassinations, its criminalised economy, its utter lack of political transparency, is a dangerous mystery for most ordinary folk. When people are unsure of everything, they are often ready to accept the most outrageous conspiracy theories as explanations for their condition.</p> <p>On this basis, anyway, Milosevic proceeds with his dismal career. In order to maintain the illusion that the world, or at least Nato, is bent on Serbia's destruction, he has this year actively attacked the independent media, whereas in the past he had been content to manipulate them and limit their influence. No critical questioning must be allowed to break through the paranoid fog. For the same reason, all but the extreme nationalist opposition is portrayed as traitorous. Posters in Belgrade picture members of the youth movement Otpor (Resistance) as Nazi troopers. </p> <p>In order to remove any hopes that there would be a constitutional limit to his rule, he pushed through changes to the constitution mandating direct elections for the presidency, lifting the one-term limit, and reducing Montenegrin representation in a new federal assembly. At home in Serbia the intention was to create what all repressive regimes need, which is the sense that there is no end in sight. In Montenegro, the purpose was to gain advantage in his duel with Djukanovic and to discomfit the Nato countries.</p> <p>The result in Montenegro is that the elections under the changed constitution will be held there next month without any help from the Montenegro government. Polling booths will be in Yugoslav army camps or in the municipalities controlled by the Socialist People's party, led by Momir Bulatovic, Djukanovic's rival and supporter of Milosevic. Elsewhere, in areas where Djukanovic's party holds sway, there will be no voting arrangements, for the Montenegrin government has declared that the constitutional changes are illegal and invalid. This half-and-half election is bound to increase the polarisation of Montenegro between those who want to maintain the Serbian connection and those who want to limit or cut it. In June, local elections in two key towns showed how finely balanced the two forces are, with one going to the government and the other to Bulatovic's people.</p> <p>The polarisation reflects historical differences between \"Whites\" who were for Montenegro's absorption into the Yugoslav kingdom in 1918, and \"Greens\" who wanted to remain independent, and regional differences between north and south. It is also the result of a power struggle between two ex-communist cliques and their leaders, once close colleagues, Djukanovic and Bulatovic. Increasingly it has a military dimension, with young men of pro-Milosevic background signing up for reserve units of the national army, and their opposite numbers registering with the Montenegrin police. The two sides have regular forces of perhaps 20,000 men each.</p> <p>Would Milosevic take his campaign to the point of war? He will of course win his election both in Serbia and Montenegro and could then argue that, with new institutions in place, Djukanovic had no legitimate role and ought to go. If Milosevic used force, he might well get away with it as far as the Nato countries are concerned. The doubts of some countries about the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Kosovo intervention would be one reason why Nato action might prove to be impossible. The fact that Montenegro is, after all, legally connected to Serbia and is well known to be genuinely divided on the question of that connection, would be another. Nor is it likely that there would be a humanitarian excuse for action, like that provided by the refugee exodus out of Kosovo. Finally, Djukanovic and his opportunistic government, which depends on income from smuggling to sustain itself, are not easily romanticised.</p> <p>Milosevic is tactically very shrewd. A war between cousins might test the loyalties of both his and Djukanovic's troops to destruction, and lead to grave further disillusion in Serbia. It is not necessary, since the Djukanovic government is more of an irritant than a real challenge to Belgrade. The chances are that he will keep away from war, but it cannot be ruled out. A relatively easy victory, with fighting kept to a minimum, could buttress Milosevic's rule and sustain his myth.

  "One of the lessons learned fast by the plotters in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar is that a mob, once aroused, will not easily be stood down: it cannot be switched on and off. The organisers of the protests in the Portsmouth estate of Paulsgrove will know by now if that rule still holds. Yesterday they asked the crowds to suspend their anti-paedophile protests, which had grown increasingly violent, and talk instead with the local council. \"Have a night off, stay at home, see to your children, clean your house,\" said the protesters' spokesman, Barry Pettinger. But he added that it was not wholly up to him: \"We do not control the people.\" <p>What Mr Pettinger seemed to be recognising was the same fact which had caused such alarm beyond Paulsgrove: that this was a mob out of control. The smashing of windows, the burning of cars, the hurling of petrol bombs, even at police - coupled with the sight of young children chanting \"hang 'em\" - had sent a chill through all those aware of the frailty of public order. Labour MP Robin Corbett has even suggested prosecution of the News of the World, whose 'naming and shaming' of paedophiles has been blamed for igniting Paulsgrove. <br><br> And yet the protesters will enjoy some sympathy around the country. After the murder of Sarah Payne, many parents share their sense of anger and anxiety, fear and powerlessness at the presence of child abusers among them. If it is true, as they claim, that Paulsgrove has been used as a dumping ground for convicted molesters, then they have every right to be furious. And when they insist that they know which individuals are interfering with their children, they may have a point: such local knowledge is not always wrong. </p> <p>The fact that the demonstrators sat down for talks yesterday is welcome. Perhaps they will be persuaded by the police evidence that they have repeatedly hounded the innocent, torching the homes and wrecking the lives of people who have nothing to do with child abuse. Perhaps, too, they will accept that their actions have actually increased the risk to their children, by driving paedophiles underground where they cannot be monitored. Maybe they will even realise that paedophilia is not a single enemy: that there are some abusers whose behaviour, though indecent and vile, does not represent a homicidal threat to children.</p> <p>But there are grounds for pessimism. For what this stand-off has exposed is the chasm that divides the 3,000 or so estates (the government's figure) like Paulsgrove from the more affluent, sheltered parts of Britain where calmer discussion prevails. The liberal arguments familiar in newspapers, TV studios, parliamentary tea rooms and bishops' studies cut no ice among the boarded-up stores and sub-standard housing of Paulsgrove. For them, the distinction between a convicted and suspected paedophile is academic: \"Either way, we just want them out of here,\" said one of the protesters' leaders on Wednesday. What might be the evidence against someone convicted of no crime? \"Word of mouth,\" she said. What might count elsewhere as the basic principles of a civilised society are a foreign language in Paulsgrove.</p> <p>This, then, is the real meaning of social exclusion. Thousands of estates have been allowed to become dustbins for the rest of society, out of sight and, until a moment like this one, out of mind. Now they are getting together, bonding as a community - if not in quite the way the prime minister and all his communitarian rhetoric envisaged. There are dangers here, and not just from those who abuse children.</p>",
  "<p>The last time Clint Eastwood was in a science fiction movie Dwight Eisenhower was in the White House, the studio system was still largely intact and three out of four Warner brothers were still breathing. </p> <p>Not that you would have noticed him in either Revenge of the Creature (his debut) or Tarantula. In one he played 19th labcoat from the right, row six; and in the other a bomber pilot who puts paid to the world-dominating ambitions of the eponymous arachnid. </p> <p>Today the tall, skinny erstwhile nobody is more famous than any American president (a job some people would be happy to see him doing), more famous than the Warner brothers at whose studio he's been securely perched for over 30 years, and now, at a ripe, lean 70 years old, he's finally ready to don his goldfish-bowl helmet and his asbestos space-undies. So do we have lift-off? </p> <p>Yes we do, but we also have gravity working against us. The central image of Space Cowboys is a shot of four old men's saggy backsides. They belong to Clint, James Garner (72), Donald Sutherland (66) and Tommy Lee Jones (53). Or if you prefer to linger in the past, they belong to Rowdy Yates, Bret Maverick, Hawkeye Pierce and Gary Gilmore (or the comparably psychotic Howard Hughes - take your pick). Time and gravity have not been kind to their saddle- sore posteriors: They droop and bulge, they hang asymmetrically, pitted with alarming dimples, divots and craters. Collectively, they look like a rear view of Mount Rushmore - or four pictures of Dorian Gray's arse by Francis Bacon. </p> <p> Space Cowboys is a fantasy about overcoming obsolescence and proving that age need not diminish us, but it's typical of Eastwood's terse directorial style and his taste for sardonic self-deprecation that he undercuts any illusions about his heroes' potency by parading their ill-upholstered buttocks so unflatteringly. \"Boys will be boys,\" goes the movie's tagline, but these tragic arses remind us that boys will one day also be grouchy, shagged-out old geezers reaching for their Geritol. </p> <p> Eastwood is doing a good job of growing old. Not for him the surgeon's slab, the vaseline on the lens, the truss, or the digitally adjusted hairline. He has made a canny virtue of his age - and had fun doing it - ever since he gained full control of his career in the early 70s. The Man with No Name is now equally well known as the man who couldn't shoot straight or mount a horse in Unforgiven. The man who played emotionally dead Harry Callahan finally managed to shed a tear (... or did he? - the debate rages still) in Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire, and the sexually inscrutable superhero of yesteryear even submitted to heavy bondage in the modestly pervy Tightrope. Old age is just another means of enriching his characters, because the stakes are always higher as the shadows lengthen and evening approaches. </p> <p> Space Cowboys opens at high noon in the four men's lives. It's 1958, and they're Team Daedalus, a testosterone-fuelled quartet training to be the first men into space. These boys are very much fathers to the old men they'll become. Frank (who grows up to be Eastwood) is a great flier but not a team player. Hawk (Jones) is an irresponsible thrill-junkie. Jerry and Tank (Sutherland and Garner) are a womanising engineer and a wiseass co-pilot who take a backseat to the two-fisted rivalry between Frank and Hawk. (Disconcertingly, the scenes use young actors dubbed by the four ageing stars.) But Team Daedalus never leaves terra firma. At the last moment, their boss and nemesis Bob Gerson (James Cromwell) sends a chimpanzee up in their place. They look as if their whole lives are ruined. </p> <p> Cut to the present, where Clint, now a retired Nasa engineer, is making a balls-up of installing a new garage-door opener when he's visited by Nasa techies Marcia Gay Harden and Loren Dean. A Russian satellite with a design based on Frank's own blueprints for Skylab needs the attention of an engineer with suitably vintage technical skills. On meeting Cromwell again (their mutual contempt has not subsided), Frank suggests that the only way to fix the bird is to send the original Team Daedalus into space to repair it. Forty years on, it looks as if the dreams of their 20s may come true in their late 60s. </p> <p> This entirely ridiculous, utterly loveable premise - The Right Stuff meets Grumpy Old Men - unleashes oodles of geezer jokes, as the younger trainees send cans of the pensioner's dietary supplement Increase to the old boys' canteen table, and they reply with baby food. The mid-section of the movie is a symphony of creaking joints, hacking coughs and crotchety groans (\"I haven't jogged since the goddamn Nixon administration!\" huffs Sutherland). In the intervening years, Tank has become a preacher, Hawk a crop-duster and Jerry a designer of rollercoasters, none of which has been a substitute for the status of first man in space, and all of which suggests that none of them has ever grown up. </p> <p> The story thus primed, Eastwood and scriptwriters Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner lazily subject their four old farts to the predictable, plot-pointed rigours of mainstream story architecture. Now's their chance to learn to be team players, bury old rivalries, grow up, slow down. </p> <p> Space Cowboys' best moments depend on its likeable quartet of stars. Elsewhere, as is often the case when Eastwood is his own helmsman, the pacing is a little too slack for the movie's own good. Clint's recent directorial outings have been frankly unmemorable. The Bridges of Madison County was vain and empty. Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil was horribly uneven, and True Crime was implausible, slipshod and clumsy. Space Cowboys is an improvement on all of them, but it lacks the tautness and sinew we associate with sub-Don Siegel exercises like The Outlaw Josey Wales (which Eastwood helmed after firing future Right Stuff director Phil Kaufman) or Unforgiven. </p> <p> Still, though the female roles are as ill-conceived and underwritten as they always are in Clint's movies, the famously easygoing Garner is criminally underused, and though the whole movie loses steam once the Space Shuttle is launched and the effects kick in, it's still a rare pleasure to see these senior citizens given so much screen time, droopy bums and all.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The Talented Mr Ripley </strong><br> Retail and DVD (\u00a319.99)<br> Buena Vista/ Warner<br> Cert 18 <br> **** </p> <p>Patricia Highsmith's great pretender Ripley is brought to life in an absorbing, subtle film with a relaxed pace. It never feels overstretched and there's a lot of twisty plot - and plotting - to fit in. Director Anthony Minghella relishes recreating the beaches and nightlife of 50s Italy and his film has the pleasant after-effect of a short holiday. Highsmith's anti-hero is an audacious, amoral anti-hero, social climber and - occasionally, just when circumstances force him into it - murderer. The smoothly seductive Alain Delon, in Ren\u00e9 Clement's sharp 1960 version, Plein Soleil, is much more how I envisioned Ripley but Matt Damon, gawky in big glasses, provides a very different interpretation - not a chameleon smoothly integrating into the jet set but a determined chancer. We see Damon working hard on his schemes and imitations and laboriously teaching himself jazz - the quickest way to gain the favour of playboy Dickie Greenleaf (an Oscar-nominated turn by Jude Law) whose millionaire father has already been duped into believing Ripley to be an old college friend of his son. And, as in the books, you find yourself rooting for this shameless villain who appreciates all the things the playboy Law takes for granted. The gay subtext that was just an undertone in Highsmith's book - perhaps because it was published in 1955 - becomes a vital part of Minghella's screenplay and provides a good part for a second Brit, Jack Davenport, though Philip Seymour Hoffman, creating an entirely different character from Boogie Nights and Happiness, steals all his scenes as usual. Endlessly reinventing himself, he would have made a very interesting Ripley. Highsmith's male characters were always more convincing than her women, so it's unsurprising that Gwyneth Paltrow gets an uninteresting role and Cate Blanchett is wasted. For almost 50 years since Strangers on a Train, only Europeans made good use of Highsmith's uniquely devious qualities. Hollywood's catching on: Ripley Under Ground is in production from director John Schultz.</p> <p><strong> Broken Vessels </strong><br> Rental<br> Metrodome<br> Cert 18<br> *** </p> <p> It's bad luck for Broken Vessels that we just sobered up from the last paramedics and drugs tale in Scorsese's spectacular Bringing Out the Dead. But it would be a shame if Broken Vessels went unnoticed: it's a dynamic, impressionistic look at an ambulance-driving duo - new to the job college graduate (Jason London) and hardened old hand (Todd Field). It starts as a light comedy but moves into a desperate twilight world as its protagonists become increasingly drug-reliant. The amount of wired bad behaviour on offer here makes Scorsese's Nic Cage look well-adjusted by comparison. Director Scott Ziehl (also co-writer and co-producer) keeps things raw to match this high-pressure line of work, but allows some offbeat subplots - like Field's charming relationship with his grandad.</p> <p><strong> Two Hands </strong><br> Rental<br> High Fliers<br> Cert 15 <br> ** </p> <p>Quite likeable gangster thriller which stands out from the recent bunch by being set in Sydney, with King's Cross and Bondi locations making a pleasant change. It's a rarity lately to see anything Australian apart from its interminable soap operas. Two Hands, which was a number one hit there, will benefit from the fast-rising profile of its lead actor, Heath Ledger, from 10 Things I Hate About You and The Patriot. Ledger, who looks like a hunkier Alan Davies, plays a shiftless hero - a strip club greeter and sometime boxer - who gets mixed up with the local Mr Big (Bryan Brown) at the same time as he falls in love with a girl he meets. Two Hands mixes its standard action hi-jinks and overlapping plots (bank robbery, stolen money, botched murder attempt) with lightly philosophical overtones from a dead man whose identity is belatedly revealed.</p>",
  "<p>Vera Chytilova enjoys a thumping good argument. So when she and her film crew were detained last week by German police on suspicion of paedophilia, she almost burst a blood vessel. The first lady of Czech cinema was on the Baltic coast, shooting a sequence for her new film, Chased from Paradise. Based on Desmond Morris's The Naked Ape and set on a nudist beach, there is a scene in which a young girl cavorts naked in the waves. Chytilova had drafted in her school-age granddaughter for the part. </p> <p>\"It's about the relationship between those who wear clothes and those who don't,\" she tells me. But the Germans' \"panty police\" who patrol the beaches failed to appreciate the distinction. Alerted by a fisherman, they arrested Chytilova, a cameraman and a technician. \"Paedophilia was suspected because German laws forbid filming of children on the beach,\" a police spokesman explained. \"They spoilt our opportunity to make use of the last rays of sun,\" Chytilova ranted on her release, before retreating to a secret location in south Bohemia to finish the film. </p> <p>She is the first to admit to being a control freak who recently attempted to direct her own death scene. At home and feeling under the weather, she became convinced her hours were numbered. \"I found the idea rather disagreeable that the moment after my death, I would lose total control of what happened, and someone would have to find my remains.\" As it turned out, she was just suffering from wind, but the experience was humbling. </p> <p>The scene could have come straight from one of the 71-year-old Chytilova's films: choppily and hastily edited, with lashings of grotesque humour, and imbued with the nervous vigour of their director. </p> <p>The red-haired grand dame, who made a name for herself as a leading representative of the 60s new wave, has just received an award for her outstanding contribution to world cinematography at the 35th Karlovy Vary film festival. </p> <p>\"Frankly, I'd rather have cash than laurels,\" she sniffs, before adding hastily, \"but it's certainly one in the eye for all the negative critics out there.\" </p> <p>Which calls to mind her 1966 film, Daisies. Decried by some as gibberish, hailed by others as refreshingly uncompromising and radical, it highlighted surreal aspects of the Czech new wave and cemented her reputation alongside Milos Forman and Jiri Menzel as a pioneer and as one of a generation who made a huge impact on world cinema. </p> <p>But while Forman made it to the west after the positive reception of A Blonde in Love and The Firemen's Ball (and would go on to win Oscars for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus), and Menzel's 1967 Oscar for Closely Observed Trains earned him a name that stretched far beyond the borders of communist Czechoslovakia, what happened to Vera Chytilova's career? </p> <p>Choleric, diabolically crazy, aggressive, ironic, sarcastic, inflexible and arrogant - just a few of the phrases used by the Czech media to describe her after she collected her prize. Some who know her say these characteristics stem from a bitterness she shares with others of her generation, who spent the best years of their lives working under a totalitarian regime. </p> <p>She describes herself as an \"overheated kettle that you can't turn down\", but puts it down to impatience. \"You always have to work as if what you're working on could be your last,\" she says. \"I want to move on, even if I have to crawl.\" Chytilova cultivates the art of being deliberately ruthless. \"I have no desire to cuddle my audience,\" she emphatically states. </p> <p>Tainted Horseplay, from 1988, was one of the first films about Aids. It portrays the lives of a group of party-loving actors who engage in promiscuous sex to make up for their lack of professional satisfaction. The jollity ends when two discover they are suffering from the virus. </p> <p>Her most recent film, the very black comedy Traps, was celebrated by a handful of hardcore feminists, but regarded elsewhere as a cruel depiction of post-communist Czech society. In a country whose ex-play wright president, Vaclav Havel, once described women's rights as \"dada and meaningless\", and where feminism is regarded as a problem, Chytilova's radical attitude sits uneasily. \"Everything about her films is on the edge of disintegration. I cannot watch them. There's not a shred of consolation,\" says a feminist sociologist from Prague's Charles University, who preferred not to be named. </p> <p>So does Chytilova consider herself a feminist, and if so, how does this affect her film-making? \"Is your newspaper a serious one?\" She peers over her large sunglasses. \"You ask pointless and primitive questions.\" </p> <p>Her steam rising, she explains that she does not believe in feminism per se, but in individualism. \"If there's something you don't like, don't keep to the rules - break them. I'm an enemy of stupidity and simple-mindedness in both men and women and I have rid my living space of these traits.\" </p> <p>Her abrasive manner has earned her the moniker the Margaret Thatcher of Czech film, and she appears quite flattered by the comparison - though she swiftly adds that they have nothing in common politically. \"People are generally weak, cautious and frightened of being embarrassed, whereas I'm merciless and impertinent.\" </p> <p>Film-making with Chytilova is by all accounts a harrowing experience. She shouts and screams, and gleefully admits to beating up her cameramen when they prove unwilling to try out new ideas. </p> <p>She is currently trying to raise funding for Chased from Paradise, but after the nudist beach location problem, she is having trouble drumming up sponsorship, even among the sexually liberated Czechs. </p> <p>\"Hollywood demands that its viewers have a clear idea of time and environment, and Chytilova makes films with unpeeled layers - which meant she couldn't be attacked by the communists. But she still uses that protection now,\" says fellow Czech Sasa Gedeon, a 29-year-old director acclaimed for his 1999 film, Return of the Idiot. But Alice Nellis, who this year won international awards for her humanist film Eenie Meeny, adds: \"She's bonkers, that's clear, but I really appreciate her ability to grasp what's around and to find great metaphors for social issues.\" </p> <p>Chytilova has no regrets that she declined invitations in the 60s, shortly before the Prague Spring, to move westwards. She chuckles, though, at a recent request from a French film-maker who wished to remake one of her communist-era films. \"So the Americans are remaking French films, and the French are remaking Czech films. Slowly, slowly, I will reach America after all.\"</p>",
  "<p>When people try to tell Mike Figgis that his new film is based on a gimmick, he thinks to himself that they couldn't be more wrong. It's true that Time Code was shot with four lightweight digital cameras, running simultaneously, and in a single take, which is to say in just over 90 minutes of real time, and that the result is projected in cinemas on to a screen divided into four frames, so that everything that was filmed can be seen (and heard), all at the same time. But how on earth can that be a gimmick? </p> <p>The real gimmick, he says, is conventional film editing - the process, almost as old as cinema itself, of chopping up bits of film and arranging them into a structure that is calculated to concentrate the narrative and probably has nothing to do with the order in which the sequences were shot. Simply by virtue of the technique with which it was produced, Time Code could be said to be more faithful to its story and its characters than any ensemble film ever made. </p> <p>\"Editing is a huge series of gimmicks with which we've all become overfamiliar,\" the 52-year-old director of Internal Affairs and Leaving Las Vegas said. As he speaks, he is surrounded by guitars, keyboards and editing equipment in the office of his production company, Red Mullet, just off London's Charlotte Street. \"The marriage between editing and plot has got to such an extent now that the audience is hooked on this constant adrenalin delivery.\" </p> <p>As a result, he continued, viewers are reduced to a state of passivity. \"I find that really distressing. In America they eat and go for a piss and talk the whole time, and it's got something to do with the fact that there's no interaction between them and the screen any more. I've been struggling the last couple of years to find different narrative forms. This film is delivering constantly the idea that you might be missing something, so you can't afford to go and take a piss or take your eyes off the screen. People who watch it seem far more alert, whether they like it or not, because of the degree of attention required to watch the film.\" </p> <p>Time Code is an extraordinary work, for at least three reasons. The first is the way it forces viewers to rearrange their habits of perception, following the action as it moves the focus of its several plot strands around the screen from one frame to another. They are led by Figgis's sound mix, which tends to put one frame into the aural foreground (although sometimes the sounds from frames are allowed to compete with each other, and occasionally he fades the whole lot down to silence), and by his characteristically adroit use of music. When you get used to it, the effect is so exhilarating that the next conventional single-frame movie you see may seem curiously undernourished. </p> <p>And that leads to the second reason, which is the film's dramatic richness. To get some idea of this, try imagining a normal movie, with its plots and sub-plots. Think of the action on the screen, and of its linearity. Now think of the hidden action - the other elements of the story that you can't see. Then imagine being able to see everything all at once. Both ends of a telephone call, for instance. Or not just someone waiting on a street corner, but also the person who is making them wait. Causes and effects, nar rative strands converging or diverging or just running in parallel in front of your eyes. Sometimes literally bumping into each other, as a character from one frame enters another. By his deployment of the latest technology, Figgis appears to have done nothing less than take cinema into a realm even further away from the condition of literature and theatre. </p> <p>A third reason to take notice of Time Code is that it cost less than $4m to make, thanks to the use of a tiny crew and very few of the usual Hollywood facilities. The cast, including several famous names, accepted a two-tier pay scale, wore their own clothes and did their own make-up. All of them, with the single exception of the visitor from Sweden, made their own way from their homes to the set every morning. On their breaks they ate together in nearby restaurants. No one could keep a limo waiting or sulk in a caravan, because no one had a limo or a caravan. </p> <p>The comparative lightness of the film's subject and tone - a satire on life among the ambitious actresses, cocaine-addled producers, megalomaniac directors and dippy new-age therapists who colonise the stretch of Sunset Boulevard that runs from the Chateau Marmont to the Viper Room - probably helps the audience navigate the unfamiliar terrain of Time Code. The multiple-narrative structure was inspired by Hitchcock's Rear Window and Altman's Nashville. But the four principal characters, played by Saffron Burrows, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Salma Hayek and the remarkable Stellan Skarsgard, and a dozen or so secondary players, including Holly Hunter, Julian Sands and Kyle MacLachlan, explore an emotional range veering from Sirkian melodrama to a comedy of modern manners. </p> <p> The unconventional method arrived as a development of Figgis's work on his two most recent feature films. The Loss of Sexual Innocence, a commercial flop released last year, was based on a series of linked short stories. His adaptation of Strindberg's Miss Julie, starring Burrows and Peter Mullan, shown in the US a year ago and scheduled for a British release in September, features the use of a split screen and simultaneous shooting with two hand-held cameras. </p> <p>Improvising from the director's instructions, the actors and the four camera operators - one of them Figgis himself - performed Time Code in its entirety 16 times, once a day to start with and twice a day towards the end of the schedule. Instead of a script, Figgis gave them music paper, its lines divided into the 93 minutes of the cameras' capacity, the actors filling in the details as they noted down the movements of the cameras and the other characters, allowing the story to develop in a manner recalling theatre workshops or the bands of Charles Mingus - both familiar to Figgis, who is a trumpet-player and spent the 1970s working with the People Show. </p> <p>\"It comes out of a music sensibility,\" he said, explaining the origins of the scheme. \"It's really a string quartet, if you think about it. The whole film was actually written on music paper, not only as a way of laying it all out but as an inspirational device. It took about 10 minutes to teach the system to all the actors, and to give them their own blank music paper already mapped out in the four-stave system with the bar lines marked in.\" </p> <p>They were given their cues and told: \"If you're interested in knowing what's going on in the other three stories, here's what's happening at the same time as you're doing that. And, by the way, everybody should write everything down because you need to know what the context is. Because although you think you're doing hot stuff to your camera, there are three other screens going on and actually screen four is where the narrative is at this moment. So you can just read the paper for a while. Do it interestingly, but there's no pressure on you to deliver the goods dramatically until bar 73, where you will become the focus. So at that point be sure that you're ready and in position.\" </p> <p>They filmed every morning, and in the afternoon they would watch the results replayed simultaneously on four TV monitors. Then they discussed the problems and planned adjustments for the next day's shoot. \"For the first couple of days,\" Figgis said, \"everyone was laughing their heads off and having a great time. That was lovely. It's nice when actors have a good time. But I knew that would turn into something which could go sour on itself. So once they'd stopped enjoying each other's dialogue, they started to pull it back a bit and pare it down and the improvisation became not so much about what kind of clever dialogue can we invent but how cleverly can you manipulate something, and where can you place it, and how long are the pauses.\" </p> <p>The use of hand-held digital cameras capable of a single take the length of a feature film, as opposed to the 10-minute maximum of conventional 35mm film cameras, presented the actors with a set of challenges which pushed them into a different and much freer approach. </p> <p>\"They didn't have to do technical acting to camera, worrying about marks and focus. Most importantly, as in music, five minutes into the performance you're warmed up and you're going somewhere with the character that you hadn't planned. Plus the digital cameras don't have the kind of iconic quality that you see on film sets. That's terrifying for actors, looking into the expressionless faces of these teams of big fat geezers, usually, who just look straight through you. Once you eradicate all that it goes back to theatre, but at the same time it's not theatre because it's not a question of projecting to an audience at the back.\" </p> <p>What all this does not do, of course, is ingratiate Mike Figgis, whose commitment to new technology is total, with the film technicians of traditional Hollywood. \"There's complete panic among the cinematography community,\" he said. \"I've had people spit at me at the Directors' Guild and the Academy. It's almost like this is the devil. Films are so full of pretension and of fake structure, so full of bullshit. Basically it's just that your livelihood is threatened.\" </p> <p>Figgis's cinema career, which began in 1988 with the Tyneside thriller Stormy Monday, first peaked two years later with Internal Affairs, in which he revived Richard Gere's career and created one for Andy Garcia, and reached its commercial zenith in 1995 with Leaving Las Vegas, for which he and his star, Nicolas Cage, won Oscars. His box-office failures have included Liebestraum, Mr Jones, The Browning Version and One Night Stand. In between the major projects, he has made striking television documentaries on a Spanish flamenco school and the American choreographer William Forsythe, and compiled a series of 20 filmed interviews with film people, published by Faber as a recent edition of Projections. Soon he and Laurie Anderson will edit his film of her recent performance at the Barbican. Now he sits in the Red Mullet office, surrounded by miniaturised pieces of digital kit that free him from the last vestiges of pressure to come up with formula hits. </p> <p>So has the ability to make films cheaply and quickly changed his own view of his standing in Hollywood? \"Completely.\" </p> <p>The new technology, he feels, has freed him of the obligation to come up with another Leaving Las Vegas. \"The thing now is that if you want to do one of those, you just do it. The bliss is in the removal of the reliance on patronage, which is a colossal waste of time, because those people are programmed to go so slowly, almost like it's a kind of deliberate plot to make sure that any interesting idea becomes stagnant and goes off by the time you get to make it. It's a little bit scary that now if you have a good idea you just get on with it.\" </p> <p>Time Code's four-frame format may not be the equivalent of the addition of sound or colour to the cinema's technical repertoire, in the sense that one day all films will be like this. But to watch it is to feel in the presence of something that will make a real contribution, direct or indirect, to the future language of film. And a new way of telling stories is no gimmick.</p> <p>\u0095 Mike Figgis presents a live mix of Time Code at the Edinburgh Film Festival on Wednesday. The film goes on release on next Friday.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Common Fisheries Policy</strong></p> <p>The Treaty of Rome provides for a Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The CFP is made up of four main areas of responsibility covering:<br>\u0095 the conservation of fish resources and the relation between fisheries and the environment, <br>\u0095 common organisation of the markets in fisheries products;<br>\u0095 structural policy, and <br>\u0095 external relations relating to fisheries beyond Community waters. </p> <p>There is a control and monitoring regime to ensure the implementation of regulations. Decisions are taken at Community level and implemented in member states. </p> <p>The first common fisheries measures date from the early 1970s. A comprehensive CFP regime was adopted in January 1983. The aim of the CFP is to secure the future of the EU fisheries sector by ensuring sustainable fisheries. </p> <p>While the number of jobs in this sector represents a low percentage of overall EU employment, their importance must not be underestimated. They sustain, or make a crucial contribution to, the socio-economic welfare of many coastal communities. </p> <p>A review of the CFP is to take place in 2002. </p> <p><strong>Main CFP measures</strong></p> <p>Total allowable catches (TACs) are set annually by the Council of Fisheries Ministers for the main commercial stocks. The Commission bases its proposals regarding TACs on scientific advice. A range of technical measures are in place to increase the selectivity of fishing gear to prevent catches of immature fish and to allow those that have been caught to escape. These fish must be allowed to stay in the sea to reproduce and thereby replenish stocks. Minimum landing sizes discourage the targeting of juvenile fish. Closed areas are established to protect spawning or juvenile fish. </p> <p>Despite the measures taken, the fishing capacity of the Community fleets remains too large for the available fish resources. More effective measures must be found to tackle the problems caused by overcapacity. Traditional means of control are being strengthened by the use of satellite systems to monitor fishing vessels. New market measures will ensure fisheries products can be traced from the net to the plate. <br> <br> <strong>Stock depletion: the case of cod</strong></p> <p>According to the criteria defined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES), cod is too heavily fished and the quantities of mature cod in the sea are at a worryingly low level. Depletion of cod stocks affects not only the European Union but most other fishing industries in the North-Atlantic. </p> <p>Within the North Sea, scientific assessments had indicated some apparent improvement in the situation. Fishing pressure appeared to have gone down and the quantities of mature fish to have gone up, although fishing pressure was still too high and the level of mature cod still too low. Scientists are, however, still unsure that this analysis was a true reflection of the state of the stocks. The next assessment is due in November. </p> <p>Cod in the west of Scotland is by no means in good shape, but it is in a better state than in the Irish Sea where the stock is extremely depleted. At its December 1999 meeting, the Council of Fisheries Ministers decided on a very low level of total allowable catches for this stock for this year.</p> <p>Other, but not all, fish stocks are diminishing. Overfishing, which has created such problems for cod, is also affecting other demersal stocks (fish which live close to the bottom of the sea). </p> <p><strong>What remedies are there?</strong></p> <p>There is no \"miracle cure\" for the current problems of fisheries management. The main problem comes from the fact that existing management measures do not go far enough. Too often, Commission proposals have been watered down or delayed by the Council of Ministers. </p> <p>One example is the current multi-annual guidance programme for the EU fishing fleets (MAGP IV), used to reduce fishing pressure. MAGP IV has not been sufficiently effective in cutting fishing capacity and effort to sustainable levels. Both the required cuts and the means of achieving them simply have not gone far enough towards tackling the perverse effects of existing overcapacity and advances in fishing technology. Strengthening existing measures would go a long way to tackling overfishing. <br> <br>A recovery plan for the Irish Sea cod stock was set up earlier this year. This included a closed area for a 10-week period to protect spawning fish. Additional measures regulating fishing gear in this area will soon become mandatory. Of particular interest in this case is the involvement of the fishermen concerned in taking these measures.</p> <p><strong>Aquaculture</strong></p> <p>Aquaculture is an important part of the CFP. Aquaculture represents some 15% of the volume and 25% of the value of the total production of fisheries products in the European Union. </p> <p>The outlook for aquaculture is still promising. However, much of the sector's continued success depends on reaching and maintaining a delicate balance between production and demand, aquaculture development and protection of the environment, quality and safety of products and reasonable prices. </p> <p>Community legislation sets out the conditions for the development of aquaculture projects in relation to their impact on the environment. Food safety is a Community priority. Levels of dioxin in food, including fish and animal feedstuffs, are currently being addressed. The White Paper on Food Safety, published in January 2000, indicates that proposals for Community legislation on the levels of dioxin must be adopted by the Commission by December 2000. This legislation is likely to embrace all fisheries products on the basis of the evaluation of risks being currently undertaken by two scientific Committees. In addition, new health rules are being proposed for the animal by-products sector, strengthening rules on control and traceability. </p> <p>Alternative sources of fish feedstuffs are being considered. Maintaining the same health benefits as those of current feedstuffs limits the alternatives that can be used. Plankton, eaten by fish, produce beneficial Omega 3 oil which is not found in land products, for example. </p> <p><strong>Securing the future of the fisheries sector</strong></p> <p>The Commission will publish a Green Paper at the beginning of next year to set out the options for the future of the Common fisheries policy and the possible amendments to Community law. The Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries Commissioner, Franz Fischler, has identified five areas in which improvements to the CFP should be considered. These are: the conservation of resources; the CFP's economic and social dimension; external fisheries relations; the Mediterranean; and good governance in fisheries policy through the involvement of those concerned. </p> <p>\u0095 For further information on EU policy, go to the Directorate General for Fisheries <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg14/dg14.html\">website</a>.</p>"
