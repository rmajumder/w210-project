  "<p>Reinhold Messner bumped into his first yeti somewhere in Tibet. It was 1986, and he had gone for a walk on his own and got a bit lost. A walk for Reinhold Messner is not what most people mean by a walk. On this one he was trying to follow a route taken by Sherpa people centuries ago in the flight from the lands of Dege to Lhasa. That's a walk of about 1,200 miles. </p> <p>It was dusk; he was climbing a steep, densely vegetated slope. Suddenly something large and dark stepped out ahead of him. He watched it racing along in front, flitting in and out of the trees, upright like a man, but moving faster than any man could. Neither branches nor ditches slowed it down. At one point it stood motionless only 10 yards away, then disappeared. </p> <p>He saw it again, later that night, running in the moonlight. It looked more than seven feet tall and immensely strong, but agile too. Covered in hair, with short legs and long, powerful arms, it made angry hissing noises, and for a second he saw its eyes and teeth before it ran off into the trees. </p> <p>After his encounter with the strange beast, Messner became obsessed. He spent a large part of the following 12 years chasing yetis round the Himalayas - Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, India, Mongolia, Kazakhstan - trying to get to the bottom of a myth that has been around since Alexander the Great heard of them when he went to conquer the Indus valley in 326BC. Now he thinks he has solved the mystery, and has written a book about it. </p> <p>If you know anything at all about climbing, you will have heard of Messner. The German-speaking Tyrolean Italian is probably the greatest mountaineer alive. The American climber Jon Krakauer says: \"Messner is to climbing what Michael Jordan is to basketball.\" If you don't know anything about basketball think Tiger Woods, Michael Schumacher, Zinedine Zidane. Or Pele, because Messner is now 55 and cannot quite do what he used to - a little past his peak you could say, of a man who has conquered all the major peaks of the world. </p> <p>He was the first man to climb all 14 of the 8,000m mountains, a feat impressive in itself, but more so because he did it without oxygen. In 1980, when attempts on Everest still relied on armies of Sherpas and equipment, Messner went up on his own. His single-minded passion for climbing has survived the loss of one of his brothers and all but three of his toes. And it is with that same single-minded determination that he has solved the yeti mystery. </p> <p>We meet in the highly inappropriate surroundings of the European parliament building in Brussels, as Messner is now an MEP, albeit a slightly reluctant one. His office is down a long, grey, confusingly numbered corridor. He looks out of place and a little unhappy among all that bureaucracy. There are no books on the shelves and the view from the window is over another part of the same building. \"I am not building up a political career. I will not run again. The Greens came to me. They came three times. The first two times I said no.\" </p> <p>Messner's eyes have that wild look possessed only by people who do mad things. He has a mane and beard of straggly, rusty red hair. He still looks strong, but agile . . . actually, pretty much exactly like a yeti, though a bit shorter.And he probably doesn't throw rocks at people, or abduct women but I didn't dare ask.\"Before '86 I wrote in my books the yeti is bullshit. But then when I have seen this big animal, which I could not see exactly what it was, I understood that it was exactly matching with the legend.\" Messner says \"bullshit\" a lot - not as an expletive, just as a way of saying something is wrong. I don't believe Messner often thinks he himself is wrong. Frequently, he does not really answer questions, or even hear them, but just ploughs on stubbornly. I guess that is what got him up all those mountains. He becomes animated and excited when talking about yetis and mountains in a way he had not when we had been discussing globalisation and the European Union. </p> <p>After 12 years of research and more than 20 trips to the Himalayas, scouring monasteries for relics and eventually seeing more \"yetis\" for himself in Lhasa and the Karakorum, Messner's conclusion is a little disappointing. The yeti does not exist. It is \"bullshit\", he would say, and does. There is no human-like abominable snowman living in the mountains. The yeti is in fact a Himalayan brown bear. \"In the end I thought to myself: how could I need 12 years to come to the answer? It's so obvious.\" </p> <p>Is he not disappointed? \"Not for me. Because the brown bear is really a monster.\" What about for the people who live in the Himalayas and have lived with this legend for hundreds of years? \"In the local areas they know all that - that this is an animal. But since only every 10 years someone is seeing a real example, so if they speak about it, all the children and normal people that never saw one, they are imagining they are talking about something that isn't a brown bear. We should see the yeti as the sum of the legend and the zoological reality.\" </p> <p>Messner is not the first person to realise that the yeti is nothing more than a bear. Ernst Sch\u00e4fer, who in 1939 headed a secret mission sponsored by the German Reich to incite the Tibetan army against the British, came to the same conclusion. He wrote to tell Messner this before he died in 1992. Messner recalls an encounter Sch\u00e4fer had with a yeti. \"The local people is saying to him, 'Up there in the mountains is a yeti, living in a cave,' and he say, 'Bullshit,' and he goes up with his gun and he is killing it. And he has a big Tibet bear.\" </p> <p>Both Sir Edmund Hillary and the Dalai Lama, says Messner, agree that the yeti is just a bear. So what about about all those famous footprints of huge two-legged creatures in the snow? Messner shows me with his hands how a bear might walk on all fours, but with its back feet going into the prints of the front feet to make bigger prints which would appear to be of a two-legged animal. </p> <p>It is not just the yeti myth that Messner has the answer to. Messner knows that George Mallory did not reach the summit of Everest - because of where his body was found and the shoes he was wearing. \"The second step with these shoes is impossible. He could not have done it. </p> <p>\"But most of the people in their books, they say probably he was up, because this is selling much better. If you say it was impossible he was at the summit nobody is interested.\" </p> <p>Messner may have the same problem with the yeti book. He has done a few lectures but has not had the turnout he hoped for. \"A lot of people said, 'I'm not coming for a bear.' I would have much more success if it had been the other way round - if I'd claimed that it is some big human-like creature. But this is not the answer.\" </p> <p>\u0095 My Quest for the Yeti is published by Macmillan on August 25, priced \u00a314.99.</p>",

  "A Spanish army officer was shot dead today in the northern city of Pamplona in an attack that bore the hallmark of the Basque separatist group Eta, the Spanish defence ministry said. <p>The second lieutenant, identified as Francisco Vicente, was shot twice in the back of the head as he drove into the garage of his house on the outskirts of Pamplona, said a spokesman for the provincial government. </p> <p>No group claimed responsibility, but the shooting came amid a wave of violence blamed on Eta. The group was blamed for two car bomb attacks yesterday, one in the northern Basque town of Zumaia in which one person was killed and another in Madrid which injured 11 people. </p> <p>On Monday, four suspected Eta members were killed when their car, laden with explosives, blew up on the outskirts of the Basque city of Bilbao. </p> <p>Pamplona is the capital of the Navarra region which Eta claims as part of a Basque homeland along with the adjacent Basque region itself and three provinces in France. </p> <p>Eta has regularly targeted military personnel as part of its 32-year campaign for Basque independence. If the group's responsibility is confirmed Lieut Vicente would be its ninth victim since it ended a 14-month ceasefire in December. </p> <p>The group normally claims responsibility for its attacks several weeks later.</p>",
  "<p>A shot that does not call for tracks <br> Is agony for poor dear Max, <br> Who, separated from his dolly, <br> Is wrapped in deepest melancholy. </p> <p>James Mason </p> <p> At the beginning of Max Ophuls's 1950 movie La Ronde, the Master of Ceremonies walks through a film studio on to a fin de si\u00e8cle set, changes into an opera cloak, begins to sing an Oscar Straus waltz and spins a merry-go-round. It is a carousel of deceit, on which lovers meet. Then one of them turns to another, then that other turns to another, and so on until the circle is completed. At one point, the MC snips a length of film with a pair of scissors. </p> <p>He is the alter ego of Max Ophuls, whose films are merry-go-rounds, moving to the sound of a waltz or a rondo capriccio as the camera tracks and circles. Like the couples in La Ronde, the earrings of Madame De... (1953) are passed from hand to hand until they, too, come full circle. In Lola Mont\u00e8s (1955) the ringmaster (Peter Ustinov), another of the director's surrogates, cracks his whip as the notorious courtesan, now reduced to a circus attraction, reminisces and the camera revolves 360 degrees to reveal her past. </p> <p>The past returns in Leibelei (1932) as the camera tracks around the room where the doomed couple were happy, she having jumped to her death after he is killed in a duel. Similarly, the past is relived as the concert pianist reads the Letter From An Unknown Woman (1948), who is dead, just before he is likely to be killed in a duel. Love is Ophuls's theme and, as it is transitory - it exists in the past - the tracking, circling camera suggests time passing. \"I adore the past. It is more restful than the present and more sure than the future,\" says the MC in La Ronde. </p> <p>Ophuls, the subject of a retrospective at this year's Edinburgh film festival, does not wallow in nostalgia but summons up 19th-century Vienna or the Second Empire as part of the whirl of destiny in a danse macabre. For years, critics saw only the radiant surface and dismissed Ophuls as a minor director whose decorous style was but shallow artifice, his plots quaintly old-fashioned. However, like Viennese coffee, whipped cream covers bitterness. As Charles Boyer says in Madame De...: \"It seems superficial superficially.\" His films are exquisite treatises on the mortality of love, nearly all of them seen from a female perspective. </p> <p>Ophuls's life was as restless as his camera: he moved from Germany to Italy to Holland to France to Hollywood, then back to Paris after the second world war. He was born Max Oppenheimer in 1902 in Sarrebr\u00fcck, the son of a German-Jewish department store owner. To protect his family's reputation he changed his name when he entered the \"disreputable\" entertainment business. (In Hollywood, it was changed again briefly to Max Opuls so that, according to some mogul, nobody would confuse it with \"offal\" or \"awful\".) </p> <p>In Germany, Ophuls was a celebrated stage director who turned his hand to films when talkies came in. The second of them was a wonderfully sung (in German) performance of Smetana's delightful Czech opera The Bartered Bride (1932). Not content merely to record the opera, the director managed, by complex cam era angles, to present his own comment on the filming of opera. </p> <p>His last film in Germany, before the Reichstag fire indicated it was time for him and his family to leave, was Leibelei, an adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's play of doomed love. Far less ironic and more romantic than the play (witness the invigorating sleigh ride), the film's emphasis is on music, sound and camera movement rather than dialogue. </p> <p>Schnitzler was also the source for La Ronde, and for Stanley Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut - an attempt to emulate Ophuls. Kubrick once said: \"Highest of all I would rate Max Ophuls, who for me possessed every possible quality. He has an exceptional flair for sniffing out good subjects, and he got the most out of them. He was also a marvellous director of actors.\" </p> <p>Schnitzler was a doctor as well as a writer, and, like his Viennese contemporary Sigmund Freud, he had an abiding interest in the way sex shapes people's lives. This theme runs through the films Ophuls made as an exile in France in the 30s. </p> <p>Divine is about an innocent country girl who comes to Paris where she becomes a chorus girl, gets involved with a dope-peddling snake charmer, a milkman and a lesbian, who fancies her. Though the film was dismissed at the time, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut later called it \"a real little masterpiece, with, naturally, that Ophulsian frenzy which drives the camera up staircases, into the flies, in and out of the wings\". Ophuls then turned Goethe's 18th-century tale Werther into a wild 19th-century romance, shifting the tragedy from the hero to the heroine. (He later considered he had betrayed his beloved Goethe, a copy of whose Faust was beside his bed when he died in hospital in Hamburg in 1957 aged 55.) </p> <p>Mayerling to Sarajevo, his last completed film before his departure for the US, found Ophuls relishing the sort of thing he did best - casting an ironic eye on the extravagances and absurdities of the aristocracy and portraying a bitter-sweet romance against a background of balls, operas and rides through the woods. </p> <p>Ophuls arrived in Hollywood in 1941, and had to wait six years before he was given a film to direct. Like other European auteurs at the time, such as Jean Renoir and Fritz Lang, he was treated shabbily by the American film industry. He didn't have much liberty on his first American film, a rarely seen costume drama The Exile (1947), shot in sepia tones, starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr as the exiled Charles II of England. (Two endings were shot: the never-before-seen one will be shown at Edinburgh in a new print.) He also made two brooding films noirs, Caught and The Reckless Moment (both 1949), starring James Mason as romantic doctor and slimy blackmailer respectively - rare instances of Ophuls dealing with a contemporary setting. The only film he made in the US that suggests the European period, and one of the best of that underestimated genre \"the women's picture\", was Letter From an Unknown Woman (1948), a heart-rending tale in which turn-of-the-century Vienna is lovingly recreated. </p> <p>In 1949, Ophuls returned to Paris, where he made his last four masterpieces: La Ronde; Le Plaisir (1952), based on three Guy de Maupassant stories; Madame De...; and Lola Mont\u00e8s - his only work in colour. </p> <p>In the first story in Le Plaisir, a masked dancer sweeps into a dance hall, the camera moving with him as he whirls and whirls, the music getting livelier until he falls. Madame De... has a dizzying sequence in which a couple (Danielle Darrieux and Vittorio De Sica) dance from ball to ball as their relationship deepens. Lola Mont\u00e8s tells the story of Lola's love affairs with, among others, Franz Liszt, King Ludwig I of Bavaria and a student. The extraordinary treatment of space on the CinemaScope screen (using masking and other devices), the crane shots and elaborate camera movements have the virtuosity of a Liszt sonata. It was an expensive film that lost a great deal of money, and was shown in a heavily cut version for years. Ophuls, who had been suffering from a cardiac problem, spent his last two years fighting to prevent the movie from being shown in the mutilated form. He died not long after its disastrous release. However, the restored film is now considered a classic. </p> <p>\u0095 The Max Ophuls retrospective starts on August 14 as part of the Edinburgh film festival (0131-623 8030) and will be followed by a season at the National Film Theatre in September</p>",
  "Bowing to pressure from MPs who say his maverick style has worsened Indonesia's many crises, President Abdurrahman Wahid announced today he would hand over day-to-day administration to his popular deputy, Megawati Sukarnoputri. <p>Mr Wahid said he would trim and restructure his cabinet to increase its efficiency and effectiveness under the leadership of Vice President Megawati, but retain overall control. </p> <p>\"I understand the need to change the management of the government,\" Mr Wahid said in a speech to the 700-member People's Consultative Assembly. \"Because of this I will ask the vice president to carry out daily technical duties.\"</p> <p>She would remain accountable to him under Indonesia's existing presidential form of government Mr Wahid said, adding that he would take more interest in foreign policy. Until now, Ms Megawati has played a silent back-seat role to the maverick Mr Wahid, leading to accusations that she lacks ability and confidence despite her popularity and pedigree as the daughter of Indonesia's founding president Sukarno. </p> <p>Mr Wahid said Ms Megawati would be in charge of formulating cabinet agendas and deciding priorities for the implementation of policy. </p> <p>Mr Wahid's decision to surrender greater powers to Ms Megawati came the day after senior MPs demanded such a move. Most factions within the 700-member People's Consultative Assembly accused Mr Wahid of mishandling the nation's affairs during his first 10 months in office. Some claimed that his unpredictable behaviour had harmed Indonesia's economy and imperiled political stability. </p> <p>Earlier, several of Mr Wahid's aides had said the president had been considering the appointment of a prime minister to work under himself and Ms Megawati. The decision to abandon this plan and empower Ms Megawati was warmly received by the assembly. </p> <p>Akbar Tandjung, the parliament's speaker, said Ms Megawati could lighten the burdens of office now shouldered by the nearly blind Mr Wahid, who has been weakened by a series of strokes. </p> <p>\"We believe the vice president can take over the daily operations of the government,\" said Mr Tandjung, whose Golkar party controls the second largest number of seats in the legislature behind Ms Megawati's party.</p>",
  "<p>The annual race to 1000 first-class runs has been more of a marathon than a sprint in this seam-friendly summer. But the outcome was no less predictable. The first three past the post were Michael Bevan (Sussex), Darren Lehmann (Yorkshire) and Matthew Hayden (Northants) - all hard-hitting, left-handed Australians who are unwanted by their Test side but continue to feast on the juicy titbits served up by county cricket's buffet. Kent's Indian import Rahul Dravid is next in line with 979 runs and could pass the mark today against Durham. The leading Englishman? Somerset's Peter Bowler, on 945 - and even he grew up down under. In the bowling, Worcestershire's Glenn McGrath is runaway leader with 62 wickets. </p> <p>So the imports are at it again, showing up our homegrown players and preventing our youngsters from playing regular first-team cricket. Hmm. First old chestnut first: when it comes to the averages, overseas cricketers are operating on a playing field that makes Lord's look level. Where they get to face county attacks for the entire season, England's best are either on Test duty or, because of central contracts, resting from the county games - and thus missing out on easier runs. A Lehmann might face a Caddick-less Somerset, while a Stewart will be up against Curtly and Courtney. The numbers crunch accordingly. </p> <p>The second point - that foreigners stunt our growth - is made every now and then, usually by county members after their team's overseas player has just failed to score 150 or take six-for. But the argument holds about as much water as a sponge in a desert. Who is blocking the progress of, say, Ian Flanagan at Essex - Stuart Law or Paul Prichard? Who's preventing Ed Smith becoming a regular in Kent's team - Dravid or Alan Wells? And who's keeping out Sussex's young Dutchman Bas Zuiderent - Bevan or Tony Cottey? It certainly isn't J. Foreigner's fault. And while it's harsh to blame gnarled old pros for earning a living, it's easy to criticise a system that allows them to cling on and clog up. It really is time to say bye-bye to benefits. </p> <p>Overseas players are obvious scapegoats for English failings. Yes, they learn a lot by playing in England conditions, but we send A teams all over the world in the name of cricketing education. And if it wasn't for the fact that our best players are busy with England all year round, maybe more of them would try their hand in the Pura Cup or the SuperSport Series. </p> <p>In any case, overseas cricketers bring as much expertise with them as they take away. Worcestershire's Alamgir Sheriyar gets to open the bowling with McGrath, who probably earns Sheriyar wickets by keeping it impossibly tight at the other end. Owais Shah of Middlesex gets to learn, in theory at least, the art of how to build an innings from Justin Langer. And Gloucestershire's James Averis gets to watch first-hand as Australian Ian Harvey teases the batsmen with his brilliant slower ball at the end of a one-day innings. It's an extended masterclass - and no other domestic competition in the world offers anything like it. </p> <p>In fact, every county should have two overseas players. It would improve overall standards, raise the profile of the competition (people are still talking about Shane Warne's duel with Dravid at Portsmouth in July), and even draw bigger crowds (not too difficult). What it wouldn't do is hold back the great undiscovered cream of English talent. Because, as we all know, the cream always rises anyway. </p> <p>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com.

  "<p>What would happen to your children if you and your partner died? A terrible question, but one every parent should face; if you do not and the worst happens, you will have failed your children in their hour of greatest need. But knowing that does not make the practicalities any easier - especially if, like me, you have not just one, not just two, but three children to think about. </p> <p>\"Oh, don't worry, I'd have Miranda,\" trills my dearest friend, who is also my baby's godmother. But what about the other two? A moment's pause, as the enormity of what I am asking sinks in, and Emma imagines how she would feel as a mother of five. We joke about how unlikely it is to happen, but just occasionally it does. And taking on three bereaved young children is certainly a lot to ask of any friend. </p> <p>Most couples ask family members, but for an increasing number that does not seem the best course. Leaving them to your parents does not make a lot of sense - even if they are fit and healthy today, if you died in five years their situation could be very different. Brothers and sisters with children are the obvious choice, but in our case we only have one sibling between us with children. Solicitor John Pears, who chairs the Law Society's probate section, suggests that you solve the conundrum by thinking of who you would want your children to be with if you were not around any more. \"It's going to be someone they know well, who sees them on a regular basis, and that often narrows it down,\" he says. </p> <p>Peter Norman, a senior educational psychologist working in Buckinghamshire and a specialist in dealing with bereaved children, says your children's ages are crucial - a 13-year-old will be more adaptable than a two-year-old, for example. </p> <p>\"I'd say there are three basic areas to be aware of. Firstly, the new carer's relationship with the child - you want someone who knows them as well as possible. Secondly, a similarity of situation - if you can avoid uprooting them, especially under-sevens, so much the better. Thirdly, you want someone who is familiar with children, ideally someone who either has similar-aged children themselves or has older children.\" </p> <p>Whomever you choose, you have got to think about financial considerations as well as the children's welfare. \"You've got to be aware of how the guardians will finance bringing your children up,\" says Pears. \"Usually parents leave their money to their children in the event of their death, but they leave to the guardians the right to get at the money if they need to. For example, they may need to extend their home, or even buy a new house. You can't expect them to be at a financial disadvantage as a result of raising your children.\" </p> <p>If you die without making a will, whoever does take on the responsibility of bringing up your kids will be at a definite disadvantage when it comes to money - because only appointed guardians have the right to get their hands on the cash. </p> <p>\"What many couples do is write what's known as a 'letter of wishes' to be kept with their will, and this spells out what their hopes are for the years ahead for their children,\" says Pears. </p> <p>Jackie Deakin wishes her brother had written his wishes down before he died. Although he and his wife lived in Corsica, Jackie knew he hoped to educate his son, Olivier, in England. But when her brother was killed in a car accident she realised that she did not have anything in writing to justify persuading her sister-in-law to allow her son to live in Britain. \"It was tough, because I always felt we were prising him away from her,\" says Jackie. \"If my brother had written it down, we'd have all known we were doing what he wanted.\" </p> <p>Olivier came to live with Jackie and her family in Yorkshire for two years, but eventually decided to return to his mother in Corsica. She regrets that she could not fulfil her brother's wishes. \"The thing is that you never foresee tragedy; you never think you need to write anything down. But you do - after my brother's death, my sister and I both got very serious about making sure the other knew what to do in the event of our deaths.\" </p> <p>According to Pears, it is often a family tragedy like this that galvanises couples into action when it comes to will-making. Despite campaigns by the Law Society, only a third of us in the UK have made a will - the same proportion as 10 years ago. Pears says some people feel superstitious about it, while others think it is unnecessary and some just put it off again and again. </p> <p>A lot of people assume that, whether they make a will or not, their estate will go to their partner in the event of their death. Not so, says Richard Bark-Jones, a probate lawyer. </p> <p>\"If you die without making a will you die intestate and intestacy rules apply,\" he says. \"They're quite complicated, but what they mean in general is that the first \u00a3125,000 you leave goes to your husband. Anything more is divided in half - half for your children and half for your husband. What goes to him, though, doesn't go outright - it's put in trust and all he gets is the interest from the trust. Often it's very far from what someone might have intended,\" says Bark-Jones. </p> <p>If you and your partner are not married, the case for making a will is even stronger because you do not have any rights under the intestacy rules. There has been a recent change which allows a bereaved partner of more than two years' standing to apply to the courts for provision from the estate - but there is no automatic provision, and there would inevitably be lots of legal wrangling. </p> <p>So what should you do? Well, see a solicitor. According to Bark-Jones, it really is safest to fork out the \u00a380 or \u00a3100 that you are likely to spend on \"mirror wills\" for you and your partner. Do not buy an off-the-shelf will because it is easy to make a mistake, and do not go to a will-writing service unless you are sure that they are qualified (they do not have to be lawyers) and that they have got insurance. If you do not have a solicitor, ask friends for a recommendation. And don't wait - do it now.</p>",
  "<p>European scientists put two satellites called Rumba and Tango into orbit from a Russian rocket in Kazakhstan today - closing one story of humiliation and disaster and opening a new chapter in the understanding of the solar system.</p> <p>The two satellites are part of a formation team called Cluster - their dancing partners Salsa and Samba were launched last month and are waiting for them. Together, they will glide in precise but changing formation, up to distances of more than 60,000 miles from the earth, measuring the electric wind from the sun. </p> <p>The sun - a thermonuclear fusion reactor 93 million miles away - is vital to life, but a dangerous neighbour too. In an 11-year cycle, it grows more and more active, shooting dismantled atoms at a million miles an hour to crash against the planet's natural magnetic shield. Every now and then a more powerful-than-usual volley gets through, to create the celestial firework displays known as the northern and southern lights.</p> <p>But it can also hit the planet too: in March 1989, a surge of blazing particles from the sun shattered a national power supply, plunging 6 million Canadians into darkness in temperatures of -15 C. As humans fly higher and rely more and more on satellites for communication, navigation and weather reports, they grow more and more alarmed about these bombardments from the sun.</p> <p>The Cluster squadron - when engineers have finished testing their instruments and got them on station - will be part of an early warning system. Because they will fly through the free-fire zone in a fourpointed pyramid formation, they will be able to measure not just the speed but the volume of ordnance coming from the sun at hundreds of thousands of miles an hour and get the message back to earth at the speed of light. High flying aircraft will be warned to dip into the lower atmosphere to screen crew and passengers from radiation, satellites will be turned off or tilted away from the bombardment. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration already has its own equivalent of a Beaufort scale for the solar storms. Some humans already routinely check space weather reports - now to be supplied in greater detail than ever, as Cluster joins other satellites turned towards the sun.</p> <p>But Cluster almost didn't happen. The project was born in 1982, and got the go-ahead in 1988: it required four exquisitely tuned identical satellites with state of the art equipment. They were completed, and then packed aboard the maiden flight of Europe's new superlauncher, Ariane V in 1996.</p> <p>Less than a minute after takeoff, Ariane exploded - a software bungle, it later turned out - and wiped out Cluster as well. Neither the rocket nor its payload were insured. Researchers prepared to abandon 14 years of work and write off both the \u00a3400m for Cluster and a decade of important science that might have followed.</p> <p>But they didn't: the sun is too important to life on earth. Cluster II arose metaphorically from the ashes, and then literally, in two stages, from the Baiknour launch pad in July and today. The four satellites will be around to monitor the sun at what scientists called the \"solar max\", the most violent point in the sun's cycle of violence. </p> <p>One recent flare-up from the sun was so furious that it completely silenced a satellite called Ace. This was an irony: Ace is one of the US satellites designed to catch the sun in its angriest moments. Cluster could be in business just in time. </p> <p><strong>Useful link</strong><br><a href=\"http://sci.esa.int/home/clusterii/index.cfm\">Cluster - European Space Agency</a></p>",
  "<p>In some metropolitan circles, young black men are seen as cool. But a sizeable proportion of the white population fears them because they are so often portrayed as criminal, socially irresponsible and violent. White fear is also fuelled by the perception that they are unstable and prone to mental illness. But many black people are similarly fearful - not only of racism in general, but of what they regard as racial discrimination in the operation of Britain's mental health system. </p> <p>These circles of fear have helped to prevent much-needed change in our mental health professions and institutions and today, in Birmingham, a small step is being taken to try to undo this paralysis. A meeting of black service users, carers and local mental health agencies is being held as part of the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health's Breaking the Circles of Fear project. Two similar meetings have already taken place in London. </p> <p>Frank Keating, senior research fellow for the project, explains that it is trying to explore impediments to change and investigate models that really work for black communities. He says evidence of discrimination - intended or unintended - has been available for 15 years and he thinks it is time for everybody involved in mental health to move on. </p> <p>This evidence shows that people from African and African-Caribbean communities are between three and 13 times more likely than others to be admitted to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The prevalence of mental illness among black prisoners is three times higher than among their white counterparts. Black patients are given higher doses of neuroleptic drugs, are more likely to receive electro-convulsive therapy or be subject to restraint, and are less likely to be offered psychotherapy or other alternative treatments. </p> <p>Through local meetings, like today's, and a broader programme of evidence gathering and consultation with black service users and their families - as well as with black agencies and other providers of mental health services - the centre aims to present some practical proposals to policymakers. </p> <p>Oneal Thomas, who manages the Antenna Outreach Service for young black people in Tottenham, north London, reinforces the \"circles of fear\" message. He says the service, which is a leading partner in the project's work, is very aware that pressures caused by racism contribute to mental health problems. \"For example, you hardly ever hear anything positive about black people; it's always about problems, so we all get locked into the disadvantaged communities debate and no one feels able to move on.\" </p> <p>The general distress felt in black communities seems to affect young men more than women, Thomas says. \"The mix of perceptions by white people about crime, violence and distress tends to focus on young men. Consequently, we find that they're less likely to engage with mental health services. So we view as our main task the reaching out to young people who are in need, and at risk, and who you know may have a major breakdown if we don't work with them as soon as possible. </p> <p>\"Our staff, who are African-Caribbean, are able to take a holistic view and so be able to look at people's aspirations and situations, rather than concentrate solely on their mental health problems.\" </p> <p>But does this mean that change can only be effected by black mental health agencies? John Cox, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, accepts that many people from ethnic communities have a negative perception of mental health services. \"That's a harsh reality, and there is obviously a double stigma in having a mental disorder and being from a minority ethnic community,\" he says. \"This results in a tendency to report very late to mental health services, and this is perhaps one reason why we see the treatments we do.\" </p> <p>Cox, who is directly involved in the Sainsbury project, accepts a need for psychiatrists to gain more understanding of customs and mores. \"Training in cultural competence is one of our key aims: we'll be setting up an ethnic minorities committee in the college to help further this, and we're mounting a campaign to combat racial stigma in order to influence the, often defensive, attitudes of mental health services.\" </p> <p>Cutting across these institutional and organisational issues is another, potentially powerful, intervention by researchers and psychiatrists. People from black communities are much more likely than white people to be diagnosed as having schizophrenia. But according to Kwame McKenzie, a north London consultant psychiatrist and honorary lecturer at the Institute of Psychiatry, the illness among black people may be very different. </p> <p>What is the evidence for this? In essence, white people diagnosed with schizophrenia are several times more likely than their black counterparts to have an identifiable organic problem. There is no difference in brain structure among black people with the diagnosis, compared with a control group, and substantially fewer black people than white suffer from the form of long-term, persistent symptoms with which mental health services are familiar. But black people are more likely than whites to be regarded as having psychotic symptoms. Crises are more likely to be episodic and the prognosis is far better than for white people. </p> <p>McKenzie says: \"We've pretty well nailed down the fact that the risk factors for white and African-Caribbean people are very different, especially the life events and situations they have to face.\" </p> <p>This undermines the whole idea of what we understand as schizo- phrenia in the African-Caribbean community, McKenzie maintains, and therefore the diagnosis of the illness itself becomes unstable. Startling as this may appear, debate about misdiagnosis of black people has been going on for several years. McKenzie believes that: \"We need to look more closely at symptoms, such as hallucinations, depression, delusions, low motivation or manic symptoms, for example, and gain a broader understanding of the individual.\" </p> <p> By doing this, he says, professionals can prescribe medication for particular symptoms and decide on other interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, with the patient's agreement. This is not just theory, as McKenzie has been involved with treatment regimes based on this approach. \"For example we found that low doses of anti-psychotics for a short period, and mood stabilisers to help a person get past an episode of manic or depressive disorder, allied to cognitive behavioural therapy which embraced the issues which led to the episode, have worked very well,\" he says. </p> <p>This \"dimensional\", rather than \"categorical\", approach to schizophrenia - which appears to be gaining ground among professionals - may offer an effective clinical partner to culturally appropriate services. And today's meeting, which is hosted by Servol, another predominantly black mental health outreach charity in Birmingham, combines these themes with the practical experiences of black users and carers. </p> <p>Hopes are high that the project will help change mainstream services. Not before time. Carl Douglas, who runs the National Schizophrenia Fellowship's African Caribbean development service in Birmingham, says: \"Black people keep asking us what's happened to all the previous studies, and what's the point of them because nothing ever improves.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Sainsbury project can be contacted through David Robertson on 020-7403 8790</p>",
  "<p>The wheat growing in the field known as the Horse Ground is now tall, golden and ready to be harvested. With Cotswold cream houses as a backdrop, it is a scene any visitor would relish. But the farming practices that govern the field are not so picture-postcard. </p> <p>In a 10-month growing season, it has been sprayed with herbicides, pesticides and growth regulators a minimum of seven times, as well as having two applications of liquid nitrogen. </p> <p>Frequency of spraying is not everything, since chemical concentration also counts. But, by any standards, this farming is intensive. And it is potentially toxic - at least to those directly involved. The seed grain planted last September was itself coated with fungicide. The hazard data printed on the sack ran to seven paragraphs, including the warning that PVC gloves and a respirator should be worn when filling the seed drill. </p> <p>\"This is not what someone with a weekend cottage wants to hear,\" says the farm manager responsible for the Horse Ground's 14 acres, plus another 2,000 acres. \"But we are producing a commodity, just as on a factory floor.\" He was prepared to speak about the field and the way it was farmed provided he was not named. \"We have to maximise return,\" he says. \"In the present financial climate, even the big farms are suffering.\" </p> <p>The grain the Horse Ground grows this year will fatten pigs and poultry. Feed wheat that fetched \u00a3120 a tonne in the mid-1990s now sells for less than \u00a360. </p> <p>\"Highly efficient farms are probably still an acceptable investment, but they are certainly not highly profitable,\" says Dr Dick Morris, senior lecturer in environmental systems at the Open University. \"Intensive agriculture is like a treadmill. The more you put in, the more you have to put in. If you sow treated grain, you've paid for the treatment as well as the grain, and you've probably chosen an expensive variety. Faced with that investment, you would have to put in other treatments necessary to protect it.\" </p> <p>Take out the herbicides, fungicides and insecticide and the yield would fall by a third from its current four tonnes an acre, the farm manager estimates. Take out the liquid nitrogen as well, and the yield would be down two-thirds. </p> <p>For the Horse Ground, that would mean a reduction in income from the anticipated \u00a33,250 to little more than \u00a31,000. The chemicals used on the field cost around \u00a3700 (\u00a350 an acre), and little labour is involved since the entire field can be sprayed in half an hour. So leaving out the chemicals saves little while slashing returns. </p> <p>The best organic farmers in the UK harvest 70% of average non-organic grain yields. But it takes years of altered management to reach this level, and it is almost impossible to succeed with organic arable farming unless animals are part of the system. And that would require prohibitive capital expenditure. </p> <p>Ironically, the Horse Ground was once part of a flourishing dairy unit, abandoned under the economic imperatives of the late 70s. \"We moved from dairying into arable, taking the subsidy available from the Common Market to cull the cows,\" recalls Archie Piper, then land agent responsible for the field. </p> <p>Cynics might suggest that as a result the field switched from contributing to a milk lake to contributing to a grain mountain. But Morris contends: \"There were intermittent surpluses at the time, but in global terms they were molehills.\" </p> <p>Whatever the economics at play, the 70s switch out of dairying ended at least 500 years of pastoral use. But the Horse Ground's long history as pasture began with an equally hard-headed financial decision. In the late 15th century the future was not cereals but sheep. Wool destined for the continent was England's dominant export. </p> <p>\"At the time, part of the Horse Ground was cultivated, but about a third of it was lived on,\" says Tim Copeland, an archaeologist who knows the area well. \"It might have been home to 50 people. But it was more profitable for the lord of the manor to have a herd of sheep than a dozen tenants, and they would simply have been forced out.\" The abandoned village left its mark on the landscape for five centuries, until it was obliterated by the 70s' ploughing that prepared the ground for grain. </p> <p>That was a loss to archaeology. But the environmental costs of farming the Horse Ground so intensively are probably more pressing. </p> <p>Aside from the potential accumulation of chemical residues in food, pesticides and herbicides contaminate water supplies. Since privatisation, the water companies have spent an additional \u00a3970m in removing pollutants from drinking water. But they regard farmers as less to blame than local authorities and railway companies who spray herbicides on to hard surfaces with rapid run-off. A reduced range of flora and fauna is the undisputed price we pay for intensive farming. </p> <p>What we gain from it is ample home-produced food. For Neil, who ploughs, plants, sprays and harvests the Horse Ground, that is a significant achievement. \"I sometimes wish people in this country would go hungry for a while,\" he says. \"Then they'd appreciate farming more.\" </p> <p>Even on a small scale, commercial and environmental considerations do not always pull in different directions. Today's tight profit margins mean that, for example, agrochemicals that increase yield by 10%, but costs more than farmers recoup on the extra grain, will no longer be used. </p> <p> And there is an appreciation that integrated crop management can maintain yields while lessening input of costly chemicals. One year in five, peas are grown to fix nitrogen in the soil, reducing the need for fertiliser. </p> <p>The wheat the Horse Ground grows does not go to the mill at nearby Shipton-under-Wychwood, but prices there indicate the extra cost of not using chemicals. Organic Cotswold flour is 20% more expensive than the non-organic equivalent. If more consumers are prepared to pay that premium, history suggests that agriculture will respond. </p> <p>The two big changes in the last millennium - when the Horse Ground shifted from arable land to pasture and back again - were both driven by economics. Pottery shards Copeland dug from the field show the Romans used the land, which lies close to the site of a large villa. \"The Romans practised what we would recognise as commercial agriculture,\" he says. \"And it is likely that even then someone was counting the sestertia it generated.\"</p> <p><strong>Field diary</strong></p> <p><strong> Early September last year:</strong> pre-sowing application of herbicide. </p> <p><strong> September:</strong> sowing of wheat treated with fungicide to prevent seedling diseases such as blight. </p> <p><strong> Late autumn: </strong> second treatment with herbicide. </p> <p><strong> March: </strong> first application of liquid nitrogen; growth regulator to shorten and strengthen wheat stem (varieties bred for high yield have a large ear that needs support); fungicide. </p> <p><strong> April: </strong> second application of nitrogen fertiliser. </p> <p><strong> Mid-May: </strong> treatment with fungicide; growth regulator; insecticide (if needed) to combat thunderbugs and aphids. </p> <p><strong> At any time: </strong> herbicide applied to control specific weed problems - such as cleavers (known as \"sticky willy\") that might strangle the crop. </p> <p><strong> August: </strong> harvest.</p>",
  "<p>Between 1920 and 1960, more than 9,000 children - some as young as six - were sent to Australia by British children's homes, supposedly to a better life. Many made the best of it and went on to forge successful careers and have families of their own. Others have had a harder time, often as a result of lasting effects of physical and sexual abuse meted out in some homes. </p> <p>But whatever their experience, all child migrants share, to some extent, a sense of loss of identity. As one former migrant told an inquiry by MPs: \"For the vast majority of child migrants, the most often asked question is: 'Who am I?'\" </p> <p>Following that inquiry, by the Commons health select committee, the government in 1998 urged agencies that had been involved in child migrant schemes to offer assistance to their former charges. It said they should be allowed full access to their files and help should be given to those who wanted to trace their families here in the UK. </p> <p>Some agencies have contracted out this work, but the NCH Action For Children charity decided to appoint Birmingham social worker, Joan Kerry, to set up a family tracing service. She also offers support to those who want to be reunited with family members - in some cases, parents they never knew they had. </p> <p>John Grant had always believed he was rescued as a baby from a house fire in which both his parents had perished. But when Kerry reopened his file, almost 50 years after he was shipped off to Australia, she discovered his parents were still alive and in their 80s. Kerry has just set out on her third and final trip to Australia to meet up with those like Grant - not his real name - to help them piece together their fragmented past. </p> <p>As National Children's Homes, NCH sent 129 children to Australia in the years just before and just after the second world war. </p> <p>\"The fact that the numbers are small has meant it's been a relatively manageable project for me,\" says Kerry. \"I've managed to make contact with 80 of the original 129. Some told me I was half a century too late, but 50 of them have wanted to use the service. I've found out that 14 are dead and eight people are using an independent agency to trace their roots.\" </p> <p>Her youngest client is 56 and the oldest 76. Kerry hires a hotel room to hold interviews and the sessions can be long and, occasionally, harrowing. One man had asked her to find his mother's grave; Kerry later discovered that the woman had died virtually destitute and been buried in an unmarked plot. As is the custom, after 14 years the grave had been re-used and, another 14 years on, a third person was buried there - this time with a headstone. </p> <p>\"On my next visit, I had to tell him what had happened and I took photos,\" Kerry says. \"He was devastated. All his life he had planned to go to the grave and tell his mother all the things he'd stored up over the years.\" </p> <p>Kerry feels very strongly that the sort of sensitive information she is dealing with should be given in person. \"I'm also a bit obsessive about the surroundings where it happens,\" she says. \"For many people, I'm telling them their parents are dead - and anybody who has had that news will know you remember every detail about where you were and how you were told. So you don't want it to be in some bleak office.\" </p> <p>Part of Kerry's brief was to consider what lessons could be learned from the child migration schemes. She believes there are many. </p> <p>\"Lesson one is don't send youngsters 12,000 miles away,\" she insists. \"Yet we're bringing in children from South America and China for adoption and moving kids from Kent to Yorkshire. It's totally contrary to the government's recommendation that children should be able to keep in touch with their birth families.\" </p> <p>There is also the issue of recording family medical history. She says: \"For my clients in Australia, when the doctor asks if there's a history of diabetes or heart problems in the family, they just don't know.\" </p> <p>She has learned that, in care work, it should be essential, for possible future reference, to record information such as the names of aunts and uncles. \"I chair an adoption panel and we still get cases where the file says 'interviewed the grandmother', without giving her name.\" </p> <p>Staff should also be careful what they write in children's notes, she believes. One woman in Australia was very hurt that someone had recorded that she \"tends to be jealous of younger children\". She had been eight when that was written and felt it was unfair. A businessman was upset by a description of him in his notes as \"a deceitful boy\". </p> <p> For some, the files brought good news. One man was thrilled to discover he had the same first name as both his father and grandfather. If he'd known earlier, he'd have kept up the tradition with his own son. </p> <p>Another client discovered the father he thought had abandoned him had in fact sent maintenance money for 12 years until the boy was sent to Australia. The client told Kerry: \"All my life I've damned my father for walking away from me, and it turns out he didn't. Seeing this file has been the most healing thing that's ever happened to me.\" </p> <p>But not everyone felt so positive. One woman who shouted at Kerry had buck teeth as a child and was still angry that nobody at her NCH home had sent her for dental treatment. \"With some of them,\" Kerry says, \"just under the surface is the hurt little girl or boy sent to the other side of the world all those years ago.\" </p> <p>The government has set aside a \u00a31m fund for former child migrants to travel to Britain if they have a close relative here that they have never seen. One man has been over here to meet the brother he had not seen since 1948. Meanwhile, John Grant has been making plans to come and see the parents he never knew he had. Sadly, his father died recently, but Grant is still coming to see his mother. </p> <p>\"I can't help admiring their bravery,\" says Kerry as she prepares for her final trip to Australia. \"I feel my job's nearly done now. I've contacted everyone I can and I've set up a system to deal with any future inquiries. I'm pleased at what we've achieved and I think they have found it useful. This is a very special group of people and, quite honestly, it's been a privilege working with them.\"</p> <p><strong>A passage of time</strong></p> <p> It is not often that an eight-year-old boy asks to be taken into care, but Bill Cunningham did exactly that. After the second world war, he and his mother who was in poor health were struggling to get by in a poor part of Liverpool. His father was dead, there was rarely food on the table and, in his own words, he \"became a bit of an urchin\" . </p> <p>He told the authorities that his mother had suffered a stroke and could not look after him. According to his file, he asked to be taken into care. So he was sent to a then National Children's Home orphanage in Yorkshire. </p> <p>Cunningham spent five happy years at the home, his mother never got in touch and the staff and the other children became his family. But then, shortly after his 13th birthday, he was told he had been \"selected\" to be sent to Australia. \"There were four of us chosen and I remember thinking it might be a bit of an adventure,\" he says. </p> <p>The four joined a party of 40 or so others who, in January 1950, boarded the SS Mooltan at Portsmouth for the long voyage. </p> <p>\"I was transferred to a home on the outskirts of Sydney and there was just no comparison with what we were used to back home,\" says Cunningham. \"It was Methodist-run and very spartan and the first thing we had to learn was how to milk a cow, which was a bit of a culture shock for most of us.\" </p> <p>He left at the first opportunity, when he was 15, and hitched around Australia, drifting in and out of different jobs. \"I never made any secret of my background and you'd find that if anything went missing you'd be the first suspect as you were from a home,\" he says. </p> <p>He finally settled in Melbourne and took on a clerical job. He was good at sport and carried the torch in the 1956 Olympics. </p> <p>In 1960, he married Janet, a local woman, and the couple went on to have seven children. \"Our only sadness was that our youngest daughter died of a heart problem when she was five,\" he says. \"But, all in all, I've had a marvellous life. That's why I was quite aggrieved when the so-called 'scandal' of the child migrants broke. They presented the whole thing as negative, but it wasn't like that for all of us.\" </p> <p>Cunningham has always been anxious not to let his background become an excuse when things have been tough. He says: \"Some people are still bitter about being sent so far from home, but what's the point? My way of dealing with it has always been to be as positive as possible.\" </p> <p>Last year, Joan Kerry took Cunningham his personal file and he asked her to find his mother's grave. At the age of 64, he has just travelled to the Everton district of Liverpool to visit it for the first time. </p> <p>\"Of course I felt very emotional, but seeing the grave and getting a copy of the death certificate makes me feel like I've dealt with some unfinished business,\" he says. \"After a shaky start, I've done OK in life. I did 25 years as a health service manager and brought up a fantastic family. And I'm very proud of my association with NCH. As far as I'm concerned, they've done a good job.\"</p>",
  "Police today called for an end to mob violence against suspected sex offenders as four families in Portsmouth left their homes after a series of anti-paedophile riots. <p>The families who left were not connected to paedophiles or sex offenders but had chosen to leave the city's troubled Paulsgrove estate, where the riots were centred, because they did not like what was happening, said Hampshire Police spokesman Richard Horobin. </p> <p>There have been violent demonstrations on the estate since last Thursday, when a policeman was injured and a car was torched by a mob. </p> <p>That protest targeted a convicted paedophile who was \"named and shamed\" in the News of the World. He had now left the county, police said. </p> <p>Mr Horobin said another family targeted by the mob had since left the estate but refused to confirm reports that protesters were working from a list of 20 suspected sex offenders. </p> <p>Portsmouth City Council has said it will offer temporary accommodation to any individuals or families named by the protesters, and has asked for the list to be handed over. It has agreed a five-point \"peace plan\" with police and protest leaders and has said it is talking to two families about rehousing them. </p> <p>Acting chief executive Roger Ching said: \"We can only look to offer people a temporary change of address with their agreement. </p> <p>\"If they do not want to go, there is nothing we can do about it - and that was the biggest bone of contention with the protesters, although they now understand the reasons for that.\" </p> <p>Mr Ching said talks between the council, police and the protesters had been productive, adding: \"The bottom line is that they share our view in not wanting to see any more violence on the streets of Paulsgrove and we will all work full speed to achieve that aim.\" </p> <p>The five points of the plan are: \u0095 All sides agreeing to work for the safety of children and public safety on the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth <br> \u0095 Regular meetings with protest leaders <br> \u0095 A council-appointed liaison officer will work with residents <br> \u0095 The council pledges to help residents campaign for a change in the law about the release of paedophiles into the community <br> \u0095: Protesters will consider handing over their list of alleged paedophiles. The council will then offer anyone on the list who is under threat a temporary \"place of safety\". </p> <p>Police said an anti-paedophile demonstration was scheduled to take place in Paulsgrove Park this morning. There was another protest last night, with more than 100 demonstrators marching through the estate, but it was peaceful with no arrests, police said. </p> <p>In Plymouth, meanwhile, police today called for an end to vigilante action after 50-60 people targeted the home of a suspected sex offender in the Southway area of the city yesterday evening. </p> <p>The house, which is believed to be the home of a registered sex offender, has been the subject of several recent community meetings. </p> <p>The crowd, which included many children, chanted \"we want you out\" and threw a stone through the window of the house, said a police spokesman. </p> <p>No-one inside was injured, but police were called by neighbours who were concerned for their own safety. Officers dispersed the crowd within 30 minutes, but felt it was necessary to maintain a visible presence at the house through the night. </p> <p>Some protesters had vowed to return night after night until the man left the area, the police spokesman said. Officers were today planning to meet local people to discuss the best plan of action, while ward officers would also be out in the community. </p> <p>Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman John Wood urged people not to resort to vigilante action, saying: \"A great deal of work is being done nationally and locally by all the agencies to review the procedures we have. \"What we are doing is working, and there is a great danger that if these procedures break down sex offenders will be driven underground. </p> <p>\"Then we will lose the vital contact we have with them now and children will be less safe.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>Why is the German away strip green?</strong> we asked in a previous Knowledge Unlimited.

He did get to marry my Liverpudlian Grandma, but remained a proud Evertonian!\" he says.</p> <p>However Sam Johnstone of the Football Research Unit at Liverpool University says those speculating on the origins of the Liverpool-Everton, Protestant-Catholic thing are talking nonsense. \"Both clubs were founded by the same people (essentially the wealthy, protestant middle classes of 19th-century Liverpool) from the same church (St Domingo's, a protestant church),\" he says.</p> <p>\"The story of Liverpool's formation is familiar to all. Everton were formed in 1878, team falls out with John Houlding (the guy who owns Anfield), Houlding forms Liverpool FC in 1892, the rest we know about. What is more interesting is the involvement of the Masons. The guys who formed LFC and EFC were wealthy, middle class, protestant, businessmen and, importantly, pillars of the political and religious establishment (Houlding went on to become Lord Mayor of Liverpool). Freemasonry attracted these very people (for many reasons) and it is known that Houlding and his friend W. Barclay were in the Lodge.</p> <p>\"And, of course, this was repeated nationwide. For those teams that didn't come specifically from the Catholic church (Celtic), it was likely that the factory and mill owners were involved in charitable organisations, religion and politics (all masonic activities). It is no coincidence that the meeting that led to the formation of the FA took place in a pub called the Freemason's Tavern. Or am I just a conspiracy theorist?\" </p> <p><strong>Footballers are generally regarded as being a bit thick and people such as David Beckham and Robbie Fowler do nothing to improve this image.

However, obstruction will be called if the shielding player does not have the ball within his reach.\"</p> <p><strong>\"I have a vivid memory of Socrates taking a penalty and bursting the net.

  "<p>Just this once, believe the hype. Big Brother was billed as the summer's monster hit, and it is. Part gameshow, part docusoap, the Channel 4 programme has not just edged in front of BBC1 in the ratings. It has pulled off a trick thought possible only in television's golden past - creating a shared, collective experience. Sixteen years after 1984, Britain can declare: \"Big Brother, we're watching you.\" </p> <p>The programme has become what American TV execs call \"water-cooler television\", a show that buzzes into office chat the next day. The premise could not be simpler: 10 strangers share a specially equipped house, remote-control cameras filming their every move. Each week they nominate two people for eviction; viewers vote on which one should leave, until only the winner is left - \u00a370,000 richer. </p> <p>That formula has already brought the show no fewer than three of the platinum hallmarks of modern success. First, its subjects have gained one-word name-recognition. Like Madonna and Elvis, we now have Sada and Nick - no surnames necessary. </p> <p>Second, the show has spawned its very own tabloid campaign. While the News of the World was naming and shaming paedophiles, the Sun got busy exposing stockbroker Nick for his Iago-like manipulation of his housemates. The viewers have seen it all, but the contestants have remained horribly deceived: hence the Sun's attempt to airdrop Kick Out Nick leaflets into the Big Brother garden. Photographers have taken to firing tennis balls into the compound marked \"Nick lies\". </p> <p>The third proof of the show's success has come in the form of that greatest of compliments: parody. Click on to the Labour party's website and you can visit the Tory house of horrors, where \"Ten Tories have all been forced to share a political home together, but as months go by the tension is rising and cracks are beginning to show.\" William Hague is blamed for creating an \"atmosphere of intolerance\" in the house, while Ann Widdecombe is \"the scary one\". Your chance to vote on this lot won't come until next spring at the earliest. </p> <p>The appeal of the show is not mysterious. The contestants are young and attractive, and they have so far complied with the rules of good narrative. We have had a hint of romance, courtesy of the (now-evicted) Andrew and Mel, and a pantomime villain in Nick. Thanks to the editing nous of the Big Brother controllers, we only get to see the best bits: the rows, the whispered bitching, the flirtations. </p> <p>But there is a darker edge to the show's appeal, too - for there is something of the prison drama about Big Brother. We watch people bored rigid, denied the basics of human life: work, the company of loved ones, the stimulation of radio, television or newspapers. We wonder which one will crack first - who might be granted early release and who might try to escape. We see the inmates squabble and barter over supplies, reduced to regarding a Snickers bar as a valuable unit of currency. This is The Shawshank Redemption on closed-circuit TV. </p> <p>But the real interest of the show is not them - it's us. Big Brother is exposing the watched, but it's also revealing a fair bit about the watchers. For one thing, we seem to have a collective sadistic streak. The housemates twice voted to kick Caroline out because she irritated them so much; the audience twice voted to keep her in - for much the same reason. She sparked conflict and that made good, gladiatorial television. When the audience saw the first glimmers of romance between Andy and Mel, they instantly moved to stamp it out, by giving him the boot. If Big Brother is a one-way mirror on the nation, it is not making us look good. </p> <p>The success of the show also suggests we like power. In this internet era, the cybergurus bang on endlessly about interactivity: now Big Brother has vindicated them. The key difference between this show and its obvious 1990s precursors, MTV's The Real World and the BBC's Living Soap, is viewer-power. Those programmes also cooped up gangs of young strangers and hoped for fireworks. But where they cast the audience as passive viewers, Big Brother makes a different promise: \"Ten people, one winner - you decide.\" People no longer defer to politicians and they don't want to defer to television programmers. Big Brother lets them believe they are in control. </p> <p> The programme also confirms our current penchant for reality that feels like drama, and for drama that comes with an icing of reality. Big Brother is riding a trend that saw BBC2 launch Tinsel Town on Monday night, a drama filmed in the style of This Life - to look like a documentary. Meanwhile, a real documentary, this year's Oscar-winner One Day in September, is shot like a thriller. The genres are merging. </p> <p>Which brings us to perhaps the most significant revelation the programme has yet provided - beyond Nick's perfidy or Nichola's bottom. It is the extent to which the line between private and public has been erased. Now we make a national pastime of what would once have been a furtive activity: spying on others. We pry into their lives and they are only too willing to show us. The Big Brother housemates cavort in skimpy shorts and bare chests, as if marooned on a Caribbean island, rather than sharing the same dismal weather as the rest of us - and they are happy to do it.</p> <p> Indeed, it is clear that exposure is not the price of taking part, it is the reason. A majority of the contestants want jobs on TV or in the media and regard this shot of exhibitionist celebrity as their big break: the lure is certainly not the \u00a370,000, which, in game-show terms, is small change, a routine prize on the last big TV thing, Who Wants to be a Millionaire? </p> <p>In this, Big Brother is utterly a product of its time. We have got used to men and women making public what were once private emotions (think of the vogue for confessional columnists) and this lot are merely getting in on the act. It's striking that not a single minute of Big Brother has shown a discussion of what we used to call public affairs: there is not a word about politics. It is all about relationships - with each other, past loves or themselves. </p> <p>We are not that different. We too are filmed constantly, by a CCTV presence that makes us the most watched-over society in the world, with cameras in every bank, every shop, every street corner. Thanks to new technology, we too perform for the camera, whether it's a home video or a webcam. We are slowly abolishing privacy as we used to understand it, replacing it with an acceptance that what was once hidden will now be on display - what was once on the inside will now be on show. We watch and we are watched. Maybe that was the twist George Orwell never imagined: we are Big Brother. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\"> jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com </a></p>",
  "<p>American Beauty director <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Mendes,+Sam\">Sam Mendes</a> is to make his return to film-making with a dark thriller set in the 1930s and starring Tom Hanks. </p> <p>The Road to Perdition will be backed by DreamWorks from a script by David Self (who, rather ominously, wrote the garbled adaptation of The Haunting). According to the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/frontpage/index.asp#5\">Hollywood Reporter</a>, the film should begin shooting early next year.</p> <p>After winning his Best Director Oscar for American Beauty, the 34-year-old Mendes appeared in no hurry to cash in on his Hollywood success, instead returning to theatre directing in his native London. </p> <p>But observers felt that it was only a matter of time before he was lured back to big-budget film-making. The presence of <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Hanks,+Tom\">Hanks</a> - who allegedly commands a fee of $20m per movie - ensures that The Road to Perdition will be a costly production.</p> <p>The film's story is taken from a long-running DC comic book written by Max Collins and illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner. Perdition plays out in Depression-era Chicago and focuses on a hitman named Michael O'Sullivan (aka the Angel of Death) who juggles career brutality with a loving home life. But when his family are slaughtered by a local crime cartel, O'Sullivan (and his surviving son) plot revenge. A spokesman for Mendes claimed that the film described it as \"an epic that will move from 1930s Chicago to the Badlands of North Dakota, and Tom is going to be playing a very different role to his normal ones\".</p> <p>At first glance Hanks certainly looks a strange choice to play the complex O'Sullivan (one assumes American Beauty star Kevin Spacey would have been more appropriate). But the actor has reportedly been keen to take on more edgy and challenging roles, and the presence of the Oscar-winning Mendes behind the camera will surely have reassured him. </p> <p>For DreamWorks, the production provides the dream team of a hot young director and an established, bankable star. Still months away from shooting, the film's critical and commercial success appears already guaranteed.</p>",
  "<p>James Cameron doesn't do ordinary public appearances. There are those who are still traumatised by the unabashed crassness of Cameron's \"King of the World\" performance at the 1998 Oscars, the evening when Cameron called for a moment of silence for the victims of the Titanic, then cut into the hush, bellowing \"now let's party till dawn\". By those standards, the press conference to plug his new TV series was restrained. Not that Cameron was actually there. No, in keeping with the paranoid sci-fi mood of Dark Angel, Cameron was beamed in via satellite. \"Attention. This cable hack is coming to you from our clandestine control centre. I cannot reveal my location.\" In the next room, the assembled journalists speculated? His house, maybe? </p> <p>With some of the biggest hits in film history behind him, Cameron's move into television is a big deal. Or is it? The Dark Angel's set-up goes something like this: after the collapse of our high-tech society, a teenage girl who has been genetically preprogrammed by the government escapes from the lab into the streets of ruined Seattle and teams up with a \"crusading cyber-journalist\" to fight for good, while avoiding recapture. Echoes certainly of Cameron's movies, especially those famed strong central female characters. But also of a dozen or so mediocre TV shows, often spin-offs from movies, the kind favoured by Channel 5 or the Sci-Fi Channel, like La Femme Nikita or The Net. </p> <p>And this could be exactly the wrong time for Cameron to get into TV. The concept of auteur TV has been toyed around with in the US since the spectacular debut of Twin Peaks. Oliver Stone tried and failed with Wild Palms. Lynch's own Mulholland Drive was stillborn. Steven Spielberg's name is on so many programmes you tend to discount it. The success story is the one that undermines the case most: how many people remember that Michael Crichton created ER? It still seems bizarre, given how at odds - stylistically, politically, emotionally - the programme is with Jurassic Park or Disclosure. </p> <p>TV's own creative giants aren't having much more luck. Steven Bochco is struggling, Kevin Williamson's aura vanished when Wasteland flopped, and The X Files's Chris Carter came a cropper with last year's Harsh Realm, a doomy piece of sci-fi whose obvious reference points - Blade Runner and The Matrix - and ominous title make it hard to distinguish from Dark Angel. So while Cameron's name helped get Dark Angel commissioned, it might not be much use keeping it on air. These days, TV executives treat expensive new fiction suspiciously; what they are all chasing are proven formats from abroad using real people, the next Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? or Big Brother. </p> <p>Cameron's working methods are not best suited to TV either. He acknowledges as much: \"I'll admit that it's definitely a learning curve for me. It really reminds me of my roots as a guerrilla filmmaker.\" Compared to movies, TV shows are banged out on a production line. And after Terminator, Cameron lost the will to do anything quickly. He almost takes pride in the way his movies are always late and more expensive than planned. \"Nobody ever walked out of a theatre saying, 'That movie sucked but, boy, they brought it in on time and on budget!'\" he once argued. When actor Tom Arnold complained about Cameron's perfectionism, he replied \"No, I'm a greatist. I only want to do it until it's great.\" It is an approach that takes its toll. Actor Bill Paxton, a friend of Cameron's, conceded that there were a lot of unhappy people working on Titanic. \"Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win the hearts and minds of people. You gotta keep up with Jim. He's not going to keep up with you.\" The Screen Actors Guild sent a team to investigate how their members were being treated on the set of Titanic, after reports of extraordinarily long working days and actors being pummelled by powerful, crashing water for hours on end. \"It's closer to manual labour than shooting a film\", Leonardo DiCaprio said. Even Kate Winslet rebelled publicly. </p> <p>Nor was Titanic unusual: the Terminator 2 crew wore T-shirts saying \"T3 - not with me\". On True Lies it was \"You can't scare me - I work for Jim Cameron.\" But in the spirit of a military leader - Cameron has often been compared to General Patton - his defence is that he leads from the front: he relied on weekly vitamin B injections and wheat-grass juice to keep him going for the 17-hour working days during Titanic. </p> <p>His ability to wear people out extends to his personal life: while he clearly admires strong women, he can't stay married to them. Terminator producer Gale Ann Hurd, Point Break director Kathryn Bigelow and Terminator star Linda Hamilton were wives two, three and four respectively. He is now onto number five. </p> <p>So even if Dark Angel is a success, you can be assured that success will have been painfully won. But just waiting for the reaction to the first review should be entertaining enough. Mr Cameron has little time for critics. When Kenneth Turan of the LA Times took a stand in the face of the massive Titanic hype - fuelled by the Murdoch media - Cameron announced that he should be \"impeached\". Fortunately for Turan - and the rest of us - James Cameron isn't actually the King of the World. Not yet, anyway.</p>",
  "<p> I had lunch recently with an editor from a London publishing house who had turned down the chance to publish Dave Eggers's A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. She had thought the book self-indulgent and had rejected it before it stormed to the top of the US bestseller lists, and we talked just as the process was being repeated in the UK. The consolatory chardonnay flowed.</p> <p> Eggers's book, published here by Picador, arrived with ecstatic references from the US and enjoyed a pre-publication boost: serialisation in the Guardian and pieces reviewing not the book but the phenomenon. \"Forget post-modernism; we're talking post-post-modernism here,\" said <strong>David Crace</strong> intriguingly in the <strong>London Evening Standard</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Jonathan Romney</strong>, in the <strong>Guardian</strong>, thought he spotted a trend: \"Every now and then there's a resurgence of books that flaunt themselves, in a tradition going back to the 18th century and Lawrence Sterne's Tristram Shandy, which turned the book into an unruly trick-box of traps and mirrors, customising it with squiggly lines, stars, black pages, pages that looked like marble slabs, and blank chapters.\"</p> <p> Eggers's Shandian proclivities captivated reviewers. \"In the early 1990s, Dave Eggers's parents died of unrelated cancers within five weeks of each other,\" explained <strong>Christian House</strong> in the <strong>Independent on Sunday</strong>. \"This magnum opus follows the family's restructure. But instead of writing a weepie, Eggers dusts out his family closet and pokes fun at the cliches of the literary memoir. He worries that 'writing about deaths in the family and delusions as a result is unappealing to everyone but the author's high school classmates and a few creative writing students in New Mexico', so keeps us guessing which parts have been embellished.\" </p> <p>The result is a memoir of Eggers's struggle to bring up his kid brother Toph, but its form so confused <strong>Raymond Seitz</strong> in the <strong>Sunday Telegraph</strong> that he christened it a novel - and a \"superb\" one at that.</p> <p> <strong>Graham Caveney</strong>, in the <strong>Independent</strong>, was more alert to Eggers's literary tricks. \"He welds the pastiche of a Bildungsroman, a novel of growing up, on to the authenticity of his loss,\" wrote Caveney. \"He begins by laying down a few 'Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book'. These include skipping sections that we may find over-indulgent, ignoring the list of acknowledgments, and even stopping at page 109. This is a cool ploy, a defiant double bluff that succeeds in heightening our attention. His technique is to challenge our points of sympathy, to block off those routes where reader and writer are expected to bond... This is Blake Morrison's book on his father as spun around by Generation X, a post-modern elegy that ironises its song even as it sings it.\"</p> <p> The PM word was everywhere. \"It's the title and the stylistic tricks - the book carries an endorsement by David Foster Wallace, and owes much to his post-post-modern, footnoted style - which ensured that this book was duly hyped when it was published in America earlier this year,\" said <strong>Erica Wagner</strong> in the <strong>Times</strong>. \"All the hype in the world, however, won't result in the reviews AHWOSG garnered over there: they were, it must be said, staggering.\"</p> <p> Wagner was one of several critics to meet that provocative title head on. \"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius isn't without flaws,\" she concluded, \"but its rough edges are part of its vibrant, courageous appeal. Genius? Well, jury's out. Staggering? OK, that's allowed. And heartbreaking? Not at all. Heart healing, more like.\"</p> <p> <strong>Anthony Quinn</strong> came up with an almost identical paragraph to conclude his enthusiastic review in the <strong>Sunday Times</strong>. \"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius never comes on as oppressive or self-pitying. Eggers has instead pitched his tone at an uncommon sort of irony, using it not as a device to keep us at arm's length but to involve us - to make the story of his life tellable, and thus, somehow, survivable. Heartbreaking? Certainly. Staggering? Yes, I'd say so. And if genius is capturing the universal in a fresh and memorable way, call it that, too.\"</p> <p> <strong>Peter Conrad</strong>, in the <strong>Observer</strong>, was also won over by the book, but offered a convincing alternative analysis of its appeal. \"The values AHWOSG upholds are hearteningly traditional (which probably explains its success in America). With Christopher [Toph's real name], Eggers is a fretful mother hen, worrying about the squalor of the apartments they rent: 'I could clean,' he ventures. Mugged by Mexicans, he recovers his faith in law and order, impersonating a policeman as he argues with his attackers: 'I am the cop, a friendly but stern cop.' By founding a magazine, he demonstrates the efficacy of economic self-help and celebrates the sense of community he shares with his like-minded collaborators. This is a parable about virtue rewarded with happiness, hard work rewarded with wealth, and moody, aggrieved solipsism rewarded with universal admiration.\" </p> <p> <strong>Robert Hanks</strong>, in the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>, tried to quibble but found the effort too great. \"In the preface, Eggers anticipates most possible criticisms of the book; unfortunately, that does not stop some of them from being justified. You could wish, then, that A Heartbreaking Work was shorter and stuck to the point a little more. But for all that, it is a remarkable debut, and likely to be one of the most striking books you will read this year.\"</p> <p> Only <strong>Adam Begley</strong>, in the <strong>Guardian</strong>, failed to be staggered by Eggers's youthful genius. Or, rather, he thought it resided in PR rather than writing. \"He'd make a great circus barker,\" said Begley waspishly. \"'I want everyone to witness my youth,' he declares. 'I am an orphan of America.' His Heartbreaking Work is a mannerist flourish; it marks an especially self-conscious moment in the ongoing proliferation of those 'memoir-sorts of books'. Only sporadically is the reader wholly engaged as one is by an achieved work of art. Curious and at times compelling, this book is more like an artefact, a bright and blaring sign of the times.\"</p> <p> The Guardian, unlike most papers, is willing to trash books which it has paid large sums to serialise. It is both an endearing trait and a tribute to the independence of its books pages. And no doubt all very post-modern.</p>",
  "South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, is to lobby Tony Blair to \"honour Britain's obligations\" and fund the rapidly expanding land seizures in Zimbabwe. <p>A summit of 11 southern African leaders has handed Robert Mugabe a diplomatic victory by appointing Mr Mbeki and Malawi's president, Bakili Muluzi, to put pressure on Britain after backing unequivocally the Zimbabwean leader's policy of expropriating white-owned land for redistribution to poor blacks. </p> <p>The regional presidents said in a statement: \"We are convinced that to have a land reform programme which is fair and just to all the stakeholders it is imperative for the UK government to honour its obligations under the Lancaster House agreement to provide resources for that purpose. </p> <p>\"We reiterate our acceptance of the urgent need to effect land redistribution in Zimbabwe to address land hunger and poverty affecting millions of black Zimbabweans.\" </p> <p>Mr Mugabe argues that Margaret Thatcher's government agreed to fund land reform as part of the Lancaster House settlement which ended minority rule in Zimbabwe 20 years ago. </p> <p>Mr Mugabe's spokesman, George Charamba, yesterday urged London to \"open a new chapter\" in relations with its former colony. \"The British have acted irresponsibly. They still have a colonial mind,\" he said. </p> <p>South African diplomatic sources said it was likely Mr Mbeki would seek a meeting with Mr Blair on the issue. The South African president has already made clear his belief that Britain should fund the land acquisitions but he has also called on Mr Mugabe to adhere to the rule of law. </p> <p>Britain has said it will unfreeze a \u00a336m donation to help pay for land redistribution but only once the illegal and sometimes violent occupation of white-owned farms by the self-styled \"war veterans\" is ended. The minister for Africa, Peter Hain, said in June that the government would not write \"a blank cheque\" to Zimbabwe. </p> <p>The land seizures have continued with the government bussing hundreds of families on to farms served with confiscation orders in recent days and fresh invasions of other land by the veterans. Mr Mugabe says he plans to move 500,000 families on to more than 3,000 expropriated farms, about two-thirds of all the white-owned commercial land. </p> <p>Despite the impact of Zimbabwe's deepening economic woes on its neighbours, some of which have seen their currencies dragged down by the crisis, southern African leaders left no doubt where they stand. They welcomed Mr Mugabe's assurance that the land reform programme would be \"handled peacefully, and within the provisions of the laws of Zimbabwe\", but made no reference to the war veterans' violence or the failure to obey court orders to stop the illegal land seizures. </p> <p>Zimbabwe's foreign minister, Stan Mudenge, hailed re gional support for Mr Mugabe's position as unqualified. \"It was full backing for the need for land reform,\" he said. </p> <p>The southern African presidents also praised Zimbabwe's parliamentary election in June for being held \"in a transparent, peaceful, free and fair environment\", without noting the political violence that cost 31 lives and other intimidation highlighted by the European Union and other monitors. </p> <p>If Zimbabwe had a problem, they said, it was that the foreign press had misrepresented Mr Mugabe's policies. \"We are disappointed by the partisan and biased manner in which a sector of the international media has misrepresented the land policy of the government of Zimbabwe which seeks to effect a just and equitable redistribution of land in a situation where 1% of the population owns over 70% of the best arable land,\" they said. </p> <p>The summit called on the US Congress to drop the proposed Zimbabwe democracy act which would impose financial sanctions on Mr Mugabe's administration because of the \"violence, intimidation and killings orchestrated and supported by the government\". </p> <p>The leaders said: \"This punitive piece of legislation is counterproductive and unjust because it will have far-reaching negative implications for the economic development and evolution of democratic institutions in Zimbabwe in particular and the region in general.\" </p> <p>But Mr Mugabe received a fresh reminder of the cost of his policies yesterday when South Africa's electricity generator, Eskom, warned that it might cut supplies to Zimbabwe because of 140m rand (\u00a314m) in unpaid bills. </p> <p>Harare is heavily reliant on South Africa for electricity. Eskom's transmission manager in Johannesburg, Peter O'Connor, said supplies to Zimbabwe were now limited to a third of what had been previously provided. </p> <p>The South African government has been reluctant to call in Zimbabwe's debt to state-run Eskom and is seeking other means of settling the bill, such as taking power stations in payment when Harare privatises its electricity supply.</p>",
  "Cherie Booth may be hurt, though hardly surprised, at being dubbed Lady Macbeth by the Tories. The jibe was first heard from the lips of one of Gordon Brown's former Treasury aides, and Downing Street long feared the description would return with a vengeance. <p>Fiona Millar, Ms Booth's spokeswoman and partner of Alastair Campbell, complained last year: \"They'd love to paint her as Lady Macbeth, wouldn't they?\" Well, they did, and John Bercow has. The opposition frontbencher painted No 10's first lady as an unholy cross between the Shakespearian hate figure and Hillary Rodham Clinton. </p> <p>The QC could face many more attacks as the Tories target her in an attempt to get at her husband. </p> <p>Supporters rallied round and Mary-Ann Stephenson, director of the Fawcett Society, who will share a platform with Ms Booth next month, accused Mr Bercow of sexism. \"The comparison with Lady Macbeth is completely unjustified and slightly hysterical,\" said Ms Stephenson. </p> <p>\"There is an underlying stream of misogyny in UK public life and it has come to the fore. If it was the other way round, what comparison would he draw? There is not the male equivalent of Lady Macbeth. There is a deep fear of powerful women with something to say. </p> <p>\"Cherie Booth is a professional woman in her own right. She does not make kneejerk, gut reactions. She thinks deeply about these issues.\" </p> <p>Ms Booth and her fellow lawyers in the recently formed Matrix chambers, specialising in human rights, stand to earn a small fortune from the act she so robustly defended on Monday. </p> <p>She has also been criticised for her decision in early June to chair a discussion on women and Labour at the party's September conference after private polls showed the party was suffering a \"gender gap\" as women accused it of failing to deliver. </p> <p>Labour decided shortly before the 1997 election to \"bubblewrap\" Ms Booth specifically to avoid a repeat of the problems posed in the US by Mrs Clinton, who, after an ill-fated attempt to reform health care, was presented as the power behind the throne. </p> <p>Ms Booth was seen but seldom heard, but it was probably always a matter of time before such a successful, clever and political figure would decide to speak out. </p> <p>Until Ms Booth moved into No 10, consorts were happy to keep their heads down. Mary Wilson handed round the sandwiches, Audrey Callaghan clutched her handbag in the background, Denis Thatcher muttered into his G&amp;Ts and Norma Major hated No 10, escaping to the family's Huntingdon home. </p> <p>Glenys Kinnock endured Tory taunts that she wore the trousers in her marriage to Neil and the Conservatives tried to \"Get Cherie\" ahead of the election before backing off, fearing it would backfire. Now they will be looking for any evidence of political splits with the prime minister. </p> <p>Ms Booth, who lost in Thanet North when Mr Blair won in Sedgefield in 1983, is considered to be slightly to the left of and more radical than her spouse. </p> <p>She came from a Labour background, he a Tory home. While she asked Tony Benn to campaign for her, he asked him to stay away. She is against genetically modified foods, he in awe of agribusiness. She wants better paternity and maternity rights (though failing to take her current entitlement), he is worried about their impact on business. </p> <p>A series of high profile cases have pitted Ms Booth against the government - for instance arguing for the right of parents to take time off to look after young children. She has, however, also represented public bodies against individuals, most notably seeking the jailing of a poll tax non-payer. </p> <p>Ms Booth is an influential figure, urging Mr Blair not to stand down in 1994 to allow Mr Brown to run for the Labour leadership.

  "<p>BBC executives launched a rearguard action yesterday to convince sceptical governors and politicians that their controversial plans to revolutionise the corporation's television channels do not amount to the \"dumbing down\" of BBC1. </p> <p>The channel controller, Peter Salmon, and drama chief, Alan Yentob, insisted there would be more quality programmes on all the BBC's channels. </p> <p>Chris Smith, the culture secretary, and some BBC governors, have expressed reservations about proposals to cut the number of factual programmes on BBC1, make BBC2 a more serious channel and turn the digital channels BBC Choice and Knowledge into BBC3 and 4 - youth and culture networks respectively. </p> <p>The governors have sent the plans back to BBC managers for more work. </p> <p>Mr Salmon said yesterday there would be fewer factual programmes on BBC1, but stressed that current affairs, science and natural history would still form key parts of the schedule. Launching BBC1's autumn season, he said the BBC was \"at the biggest crossroads in its history\", and had to adapt to changing times. </p> <p>\"We know we've got to change to remain relevant, that we cannot preserve 15 or 20 year old schedules in formaldehyde just because they have always been there. </p> <p>\"But we never said that BBC1 would become a mono-thematic entertainment channel. It will not. There will always be room for genres like science, news, current affairs and natural history on BBC1 - what we are talking about is the balance of them in the schedule.\" The amount of drama would be boosted considerably, he said, but that meant \"something has to give\". The number of factual programmes on BBC1 would fall, he conceded. </p> <p>This season, the drama budget has been increased by \u00a310m. Among the highlights is a film about a child abuse victim by the creator of Ballykissangel, Kieran Prendiville. </p> <p>Care, made by BBC Wales, will explore the emotional scars faced by a man whose cries for help as an abused youngster were ignored by adults, and has been in development over a period of years against a background of child abuse scandals. </p> <p>Traditional costume dramas have been rested in favour of modern adaptations, including Joanna Trollope's Other People's Children - a drama about step parents from the makers of the award-winning film Warriors - and Take a Girl Like You, by Kingsley Amis with a screenplay by Andrew Davies. </p> <p>Nancy Mitford's comedy of manners Love in a Cold Climate has been adapted for TV and stars Celia Imrie alongside Alan Bates, Sheila Gish, and Elizabeth Dermot Walsh. </p> <p>The increasingly successful comedy drama genre is exploited in The Last of the Blonde Bombshells, about an all-women second world war swing band reunited for one last concert, with a cast including Judi Dench, June Whitfield and Cleo Laine. </p> <p>Mr Yentob, who oversees the BBC's drama, entertainment and children's output, said that drama would feature strongly as the reorganisation of the BBC's television channels - which would not happen \"overnight\" - took shape. </p> <p>The BBC had to respond to an age where more people are watching television in homes equipped with multichannel, digital equipment, he said. </p> <p>In these homes, research shows that viewers are turning away from the traditional channels in favour of \"niche\", specialised services. </p> <p>It was a question of getting the balance right between its new youth and culture networks alongside the broad-appeal channels BBC1 and 2, Mr Yentob said. </p> <p><strong> Autumn highlights</strong><br> </p> <p> \u0095 BBC1 controller Peter Salmon brought in Fred Barron, creator of US hits Sienfeld and the Larry Sanders Show, to develop <strong> My Family, </strong> which stars Robert Lindsay and Zoe Wanamaker as parents of adolescents, and has a team of writers. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Down to Earth</strong> , in a more traditional sitcom format, stars Pauline Quirke and Warren Clarke as a couple who quit London for life in the country. Two classics, The Royle Family and One Foot in the Grave, return. </p> <p>\u0095 Pete Postlethwaite and Geraldine James lead the cast in comedy drama <strong> The Sins</strong>, the story of an ex-getaway driver struggling to go straight. </p> <p>\u0095 Culture secretary Chris Smith said the BBC should produce more \"landmark\" programmes - the BBC has responded with two big factual series. <strong> State of the Planet</strong> , fronted by Sir David Attenborough, focuses on the natural world, while Robert Winston, who fronted the Human Body series, returns in <strong> Superhuman</strong>, which aims to show the body's capacity for reinvention. </p>",
  "On the eve of his election in 1968, Richard Nixon secretly conspired with the South Vietnamese government to wreck all-party Vietnam peace talks as part of a deliberate effort to prolong a conflict in which more than 20,000 Americans were still to die, along with tens of thousands of Vietnamese and Cambodians. <p>The devastating new charge against Nixon, which mirrors long-held suspicions among members of President Lyndon Johnson's administration about the Republican leader's actions in the autumn of 1968, is made by the authors of a new study of Nixon's secret world in the latest issue of Vanity Fair magazine. </p> <p>\"The greatest honour history can bestow,\" reads the inscription on Nixon's black granite tombstone in California, \"is the title of peacemaker.\" But if the charges by authors Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan are correct, Nixon better deserves to be called a peacewrecker than peacemaker. </p> <p>At the heart of the new account was Nixon's fear that Vietnam peace efforts by President Johnson in the run-up to the November 1968 US presidential election could wreck Nixon's bid to oust Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic candidate, and capture the White House. </p> <p>Nixon's response to Johnson's efforts was to use a go-between, Anna Chennault, to urge the South Vietnam's president, Nguyen van Thieu, to resist efforts to force them to the peace table. </p> <p>Nixon's efforts paid off spectacularly. On October 31, Johnson ordered a total halt to the bombing of North Vietnam, the precondition for getting the North and their Vietcong allies to join the talks. Two days later, under intense secret urgings from Nixon and his lieutenants, Thieu announced his government would not take part. Less than a week later, Nixon was elected president with less than a one-point margin in the popular vote over Humphrey. </p> <p><b> Playing with US lives</b><br> </p> <p>The Vanity Fair article charges that Johnson knew what was going on. Intelligence reports to the president told him that Nixon and his running mate, Spiro Agnew, were playing politics with the lives of US soldiers. \"Had it been made public at the time, it would surely have destroyed Nixon's presidential hopes at one stroke, and forever,\" the authors write. </p> <p>Johnson offered Humphrey the chance to go public about Nixon, but Humphrey was afraid that the charges would be seen as election dirty tricks. Once Nixon had won, Johnson again contemplated revealing what he knew, but decided the national interest precluded it. </p> <p>In the weeks running up to the election, Nixon's public stance was that, if elected, he would bring the war to an end more effectively than Humphrey. He promised not to interfere with pre-election peace efforts, pledging that neither he nor Agnew \"will destroy the chance of peace\". </p> <p>In reality, however, Nixon used his campaign manager, John Mitchell, later his disgraced attorney general, to use go-betweens to encourage Thieu to believe he would get a better deal under a Nixon administration and to boycott the putative talks. Nixon constantly denied that he was conspiring with Thieu against the US government, but the release of previously classified FBI files used by the authors show this was exactly what he was doing. </p> <p>Chennault, Nixon's main go-between with the South Vietnamese, was a right-wing Republican society hostess who was Chinese born and lived in a newly constructed Washington apartment complex - named the Watergate. She was vice-chairman of the Republican election finance committee and an inveterate lobbyist on behalf of right-wing and pro-American Asian interests. </p> <p>Chennault regularly passed messages to Mitchell and Nixon during 1968 and they urged her to put pressure on the South Vietnamese leader to create delays and to refuse to take part in the peace talks. </p> <p>US embassy spy operations, including wiretaps of Thieu's offices, revealed the Thieu-Nixon connection in October and Johnson was briefed about them. One message from Thieu's ambassador in Washington, Bui Diem, told Thieu: \"Johnson and Humphrey will be replaced and then Nixon could change the US position.\" </p> <p>When Thieu pulled out of the talks, Johnson exploded. He told his advisers that he would go public on a development that could \"rock the world\". That development, he said, was Nixon's \"conniving\" with the Thieu regime. An adviser had told Johnson that Nixon was \"trying to frustrate the president by inciting Saigon to step up its demands\". \"It all adds up,\" Johnson told his advisers. </p> <p>On October 31, with the bombing halt announced, Mitchell rang Chennault and told her: \"Anna, I'm speaking on behalf of Mr Nixon. It's very important our Vietnamese friends understand our Republican position and I hope you have made that clear to them. Do you think they have decided not to go to Paris?\" </p> <p>Chennault made contact with Thieu once again. An FBI report said that she \"contacted [the] Vietnamese ambassador and advised him that she had received a message from her boss (not further identified) which her boss wanted her to give personally to the ambassador. She said the message was that the ambassador is to 'Hold on, we are gonna win' and that her boss also said 'Hold on, he understands all of it'.\" </p> <p>On November 2, three days before the election, Thieu announced that South Vietnam would not attend the talks. </p> <p>Johnson's bad relations with J Edgar Hoover at the FBI meant that Hoover, a Nixon ally, did not tell the president everything that his agents had unearthed. Even so, Johnson had learned enough to speak to Nixon by phone the weekend before the election. Nixon denied Chennault was working for him. When the phone was put down, it was later reported, \"Nixon and his friends collapsed with laughter\". </p> <p>Johnson was certain Nixon was lying, and told Humphrey what was going on. Humphrey learned about the Nixon-Thieu contacts while he was travelling by plane to a campaign. \"By God, when we land I'm going to denounce Thieu. I'll denounce Nixon. I'll tell about the whole thing,\" he shouted to aides. But he never did. </p> <p>In the five weeks leading up to the election of 1968, 960 Americans were killed in Vietnam. In the years to come, under Nixon, 20,763 more US soldiers would die. </p> <p>\"What the Nixon people did,\" the US diplomat Richard Holbrooke, then attached to the advance US guard to the Paris talks, tells Vanity Fair, \"was perhaps even a violation of the law. </p> <p>\"They massively, directly and covertly interfered in a major diplomatic negotiation, probably one of the most important negotiations in American diplomatic history.\" </p> <p><b> 1957</b> Beginning of communist insurgency in South Vietnam </p> <p><b> 1959</b> Weapons and men from North Vietnam begin infiltrating the South </p> <p><b> 1960 </b> US aid to the South Vietnamese president, Ngo Dinh Diem, increased </p> <p><b> 1962</b> President John F Kennedy provides US military advisers to South Vietnam (12,000 by end of year) </p> <p><b> 1963</b> Viet Cong, the communist guerrillas operating in South Vietnam, defeat units of ARVN, the South Vietnamese army.

  "A grandfather charged with sex offences against young girls was driven to kill himself after a vigilante mob attacked his home, his solicitor claimed yesterday. <p>James White, 54, took an overdose on Saturday after he and his wife had been driven from their house in Oldham, Greater Manchester, and spent almost a week on the run.</p> <p>After staying with members of his family and then in bed- and-breakfast houses, he drove to a service station on the M61 in Lancashire and swallowed 100 pills prescribed to him after a stroke.</p> <p>He rang his wife to say: \"I cannot put you through any more of this.\" He died in hospital the following day.</p> <p>\"He had been literally scared to death,\" said his solicitor, Milton Firman, who had represented him at court hearings over the past month. \"He has been punished beyond all reason - and not just Mr White but his wife and five children too.\"</p> <p>Mr Firman accused the News of the World, which had not named Mr White, of creating a climate of hysteria in which vigilantes took the law into their own hands.</p> <p>Mr White, married for 34 years and with no previous convictions, first appeared before Oldham magistrates last month and admitted three charges of indecent assault on two girls in 1988, 1991 and June this year. He denied four other charges dating from 1982 and 1988. The case was not reported by the local media at that time.</p> <p>\"He was very badly shaken when he appeared in court,\" said Mr Firman. \"He saw the court case as a blessing. You could say he wanted to purge his guilt. I took the view that he was in desperate need of help. By the time of his second court appearance, the News of the World's name-and-shame campaign had begun.\"</p> <p>This time there was a short report in the Oldham Chronicle saying that Mr White had been remanded on bail. A group of neighbours then surrounded Mr White's home and threatened to firebomb it. They threw missiles and shouted abuse and Mr White and his wife, Jean, had to be rescued by police, leaving their possessions behind.</p> <p>\"They went bananas and wrecked the house,\" added Mr Firman. \"It's now boarded up. The council later told him that he had abandoned the tenancy and could not return.\"</p> <p>Mr and Mrs White stayed with members of their family but left after relatives received death threats. \"The couple went into hiding in bed-and-breakfast houses in the Saddleworth area,\" said Mr Firman. \"He was due in court on Monday. I was ready to ask for a police escort. He could not have gone through the front door because he was so terrified.\"</p> <p>On Saturday morning, Mr White left his secret address and said he was going to buy a paper. He drove to the motorway services on the M61 near Chorley, Lancashire, and took the fatal overdose.</p> <p>Yesterday his family placed an in memoriam notice in the Oldham Chronicle describing him as a \"beloved husband and the best dad in the world\".</p> <p>\"Before the attacks, Mr White was coping and wanting to receive treatment,\" said Mr Firman. \"He was full of remorse, which is very unusual in these cases, and was adamant that he was not guilty of four of the charges. Now as a result of the hysteria that has been whipped up, he and his family have been punished beyond all reason. His widow and children are now grieving and will eventually consider what rights they wish to exercise.\"</p> <p>Of the role of the News of the World, he added: \"To place concerns for our moral welfare in the hands of such papers sets a very dangerous precedent.\"</p> <p>The News of the World said last night: \"This case has quite clearly nothing whatsoever to do with the News of the World. The man concerned had not been named in the News of the World 'For Sarah' campaign.\"</p>",
  "<p>BP yesterday promised a resurgence in North Sea activity, earmarking almost \u00a3664m to be spent on a range of projects in untapped reserves. </p> <p>Spending next year is to be increased further in what the petrochemicals group described as an \"exciting\" area as oil prices remain close to a nine-year high.</p> <p>The global oil industry's second largest company is awash with cash after reporting record second-quarter profits - 164% higher at \u00a32.4bn - and is under pressure to spend it or give it back to shareholders through buybacks.</p> <p>Chief executive Sir John Browne said BP had encouraging oil and gas discoveries in offshore US fields, Angola and the Caspian Sea, but that the UK sector should not be seen as an area in decline.</p> <p>\"Obituaries for the North Sea have been written somewhat prematurely. There are some exciting things to do, and North Sea investment is rising for several reasons,\" he said, pointing to developments in technology with advanced control systems and enhanced recovery techniques.</p> <p>BP's production of crude and natural gas in the UK sector fell in the first half of the year to 550,000 barrels a day from 575,000 in the same period last year, but overall North Sea output is not in decline.</p> <p>Experts say the number of offshore jobs is unlikely to increase, and yards that build big platforms will continue to struggle as oil is produced via hi-tech sub-acquatic systems controlled from the shore.</p> <p>BP plans to raise its overall capital spend by \u00a3900m to \u00a38.9bn per annum over the next three years as it aims to increase oil production by up to 5% each year and gas output by nearly 10%.</p> <p>Capital spending in the second quarter was \u00a31.6bn, up 35% compared with 12 months ago - of which \u00a3199m went to the North Sea.</p> <p>The record pro-forma result, adjusted for special items, at \u00a32.4bn compared with analyst expectations of \u00a32.19bn to \u00a32.3bn and came on the back of strong crude prices and cost-cutting undertaken following a series of mergers.</p> <p>But the company came under fire from financial analysts at a presentation to them in London. They argued that the series of mergers had made it difficult to compare like with like. Mark Horn, an oil analyst with T Hoare, said afterwards: \"We are told they [the figures] are good, but it's not that easy to measure them.\"</p> <p>Sir John tacitly admitted he was frustrated that the BP share price had underperformed those of its peers, and accepted that the takeover of Amoco, Arco, Vastar Resources and then Burmah Castrol had clouded the picture for investors.</p> <p>The future should be better, he insisted \"now we can demonstrate with simplicity what the results have been\".</p> <p>The BP chairman said the group had continued to beat its targets on savings with the integration of BP and Arco saving up to \u00a3600m during the last six months.</p> <p>\"These results represent the cumulative impact of the progress we've made over the last few years - growth in volume and, equally important, growth in total productivity,\" he explained.</p> <p>BP claimed to have a return on capital of 21%, whereas Shell last week said it was on par with Exxon Mobil at 16%. The American oil group, which is the world's largest, reported a 123% rise in second-quarter profits while Shell showed a 95% growth. Analysts said each had used different calculations to produce their data. BP shares ended the day down 14p at 593p.</p>",
  "\"Robocop\" police chief Ray Mallon has formally accused senior colleagues in Cleveland of conspiring to pervert the course of justice in the long and bitter row over his \"zero tolerance\" methods. <p>Lawyers for the superintendent, who remains suspended after he was cleared in June of criminal misuse of informers, have sent allegations to the home secretary, Jack Straw, and are demanding a criminal investigation.</p> <p>The move follows the revelation that a separate claim of \"dirty tricks\" against Mr Mallon, made under recent legislation to protect whistleblowers, came from the head of the force's media department.</p> <p>Joanne Malone has worked for Cleveland for 13 years and supervised much of the official reaction to the 2 year investigation of Mr Mallon, Operation Lancet. She is understood to have wanted to resign because of the manoeuvrings she alleges went on.</p> <p>Her whistleblowing claim accuses the chief constable of Cleveland, Barry Shaw, of sanctioning the leak of a severely critical analysis of Mr Mallon's policing methods by independent barristers advising the Home Office.</p> <p>The QCs described the superintendent, nicknamed \"Robocop\" after admiring comments on zero tolerance from Tony Blair, Jack Straw and Michael Howard, as having run a \"woeful and chaotic\" regime in Middlesbrough, including deals with criminal informants which showed \"a complete indifference\" to the law. Ms Malone, who made her allegations under the Public Interest Disclosure Act to Cleveland's assistant chief constable Della Canning, is due back from leave next week.</p> <p>Her claims are being investigated by South Yorkshire's chief constable, Michael Hedges, at the request of Cleveland police authority, which decided last week not to suspend Mr Shaw during the inquiry.</p> <p>Mr Mallon made his fiercest accusations to date on yesterday's Radio 4 programme On the Ropes, when he told interviewer John Humphrys: \"I am making an allegation of a conspiracy against me to pervert the course of justice, and I expect that allegation to be investigated with as much vigour as the investigation into me was performed.</p> <p>\"I feel very much aggrieved in relation to the way that I've been treated and I want justice. But that doesn't mean to say I want vengeance. I feel extremely strong, as strong now as what I was on the day [prior to my being suspended], and this is something I will not walk away from.\"</p> <p>His lawyers, Rowe and Cohen of Manchester, said the Home Office was the last resort, because all the official complaint channels in Cleveland involved people concerned with Operation Lancet or accused of leaks or other alleged malpractice.</p> <p>Mr Mallon, 45, is a Teesside undertaker's son who left school at 16 with no qualifications. He has made it clear that he believes senior colleagues resented the publicity given to his work and the way that zero tolerance was linked with his name.</p> <p>Cleveland police declined to comment yesterday, but Mr Shaw has linked informant handling in parts of his force with the disastrous collapse of one of Britain's biggest drug cases in 1992, and stated publicly last month that he believed some officers in his force should be in jail and others sacked.</p> <p>The Home Office said the lawyers' letter would be seen by Mr Straw on his return from holiday later this month. The normal course of events, said a spokesman, would be that the matter would be passed to Cleveland police, who have the powers to bring in an outside force to investigate if necessary. An inquiry would be the fourth related to Operation Lancet, which began with Mr Mallon's suspension in December 1997.</p>",
  "The Scottish driver of a coach that overturned in central France, killing a 15-year-old boy and seriously injuring three others, was last night expected to be charged with manslaughter. <p>Judicial sources said that Adrian MacDonald, who was on his first trip to the continent on Monday when the coach careered off the A71 motorway outside the town of Vierzon, was questioned by police \"as a suspect\". They concluded that he had fallen asleep at the wheel and it was believed he would be formally charged last night. They said his co-driver, Craig Linton, who was sitting in the crew seat at the time of the crash at 6.25am, was questioned as a witness and would not be charged. Both were still suffering from shock, they added. </p> <p>A British embassy spokeswoman said that five people, including the drivers, were still in hospital in the towns of Bourges, Tours and Vierzon following the crash, in which an Edinburgh teenager, Craig Norsworthy, died. </p> <p>Another boy, Ross Buckmaster, 15, from the Chadwell Heath Foundation school in Essex, suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine, and may be permanently disabled. A group leader had sustained a leg injury and another schoolgirl had been badly cut, but would probably be released today, the spokeswoman said. </p> <p>The coach, chartered by PGL Travel from a firm in Dunfermline, Rennies, was carrying 38 children and eight adults from the Chadwell Heath school and the 41st Edinburgh Boys' Brigade company to a holiday camp near Brive in southern France. </p> <p>Thirteen of the Essex schoolchildren, looking bruised and battered, returned to Heathrow airport on Monday night, and most of the Boys' Brigade members flew back to Scotland yesterday afternoon. </p> <p>The troop's acting leader, Alan Meikle, 23, said on arrival that the group was \"shattered\" both mentally and physically. He added: \"This has been a very traumatic time for everyone. Our thoughts are with Mr and Mrs Norsworthy and all the friends of Craig. We are without a friend, but we will take steps to remember Craig in an appropriate way. There is no more that can be said about the incident. Most people on board were asleep at the time, and were awoken only on impact.\" </p> <p>Nicola Goggin, 24, a teacher at the Chadwell Heath school, who sprained her knee in the crash, praised the French authorities for their handling of the crash but said her thoughts were with the injured and those who had lost a friend. </p> <p>\"We want to send our best wishes to the Scottish group,\" she said. \"The children have been through a hell of a lot. They are bruised and battered, they need rest.\" </p> <p>Rennies said that the firm's deputy general manager, Alastair Bayliss, had travelled to France to see Mr MacDonald, and the firm had also arranged for a legal representative to attend his police interview. </p> <p>The judicial sources said he faced charges of losing control of his vehicle, involuntary injury and involuntary manslaughter. The offences carry a maximum penalty of three years in jail and a \u00a330,000 fine, although in the past foreign drivers convicted in similar accidents have received lower fines and suspended sentences.</p>",
  "A mentally disabled man will almost certainly be executed in Texas today unless George W Bush, the front-runner to become next president of the United States, applies his doctrine of \"compassionate conservatism\" to this emotive case. <p>But even the condemned man's lawyer believes that there is only one chance in five that the supreme court or Mr Bush, governor of the state where more people are put to death than any other, will stay the execution of Oliver Cruz, 33. </p> <p>\"We think it's a go for both of them,\" said Larry Todd, Texas department of criminal justice spokesman, referring to Cruz and Brian Roberson, 36, also due to die today. \"We're preparing as we do for any execution.\" The men's execution dates were set by different judges and are the same day by coincidence. </p> <p>Cruz, whose IQ has tested between 63 and 76, has spent 12 years on death row and does not dispute his conviction for the rape and murder of a 24-year-old woman. </p> <p>A psychologist called by the defence told his trial that Cruz was mentally impaired. \"That's the tragedy of this case,\" said Jeffrey Pokarak. \"The law is going to prevent the execution of people like Cruz in six to eight months, so he would be the last retarded person to die under the old law.\" </p> <p>The state did not contradict the psychologist's trial evidence but rather contended that this simply made Cruz more dangerous. At the time he could hardly read or write: three times he failed the army entrance exam and he could not understand a job application form. </p> <p>Thirty-eight of the 50 states allow capital punishment but, of these, 13 do not put mentally impaired killers to death. The Texas legislature failed last year to approve a law banning such executions but is thought to be likely to do so next year. </p> <p>Two hundred and twenty- five people have been executed in the state since the death penalty was restored there 18 years ago, 138 of them - more than three-fifths - under the Bush administration that won power in 1995. </p> <p>Mr Bush has granted only one temporary reprieve and a spokesman for him said: \"Governor Bush believes that the jury should consider all the evidence regarding mental impairment and decide whether a death sentence is appropriate.\" </p> <p>His brother, Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida, refuses to sign death warrants for people with \"severe retardation\" and executions have been suspended in Illinois after unease about a number of cases. </p> <p>But the issue is unlikely to have an impact on the presidential election campaign, even though the latest poll showed that support for the death penalty had fallen to 66%, the lowest in 19 years. </p> <p><b>Links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/execstats.htm /\" target=\"_NEW\"> Texas dept of criminal justice: death row</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org\" target=\"_NEW\">US Death Penalty Information Center</a></p>",
  "Barely 12 hours after four members of the separatist group ETA apparently blew themselves apart transporting a bomb in Bilbao on Monday night, a prominent Basque businessman was killed yesterday by a car bomb. <p>A third blast, caused by another car bomb, injured 11 people in a mainly residential area north of Madrid's city centre yesterday evening. Several politicians live in the area. A security guard suffered serious head injuries after being struck by shrapnel; two children, aged three and five, were among others hurt. </p> <p>Police said they received a telephone warning minutes before the bomb went off from a man who claimed to represent ETA. </p> <p>The two attacks yesterday may have been staged at short notice to prove that the organisation - which is thought to have relatively few \"commando\" units - had not been crippled by the deaths in Bilbao. </p> <p>But the sudden upsurge in violence is more likely to reflect the determination of ETA's newly installed hardline leadership to escalate its campaign, which has now claimed 12 lives since the group ended its ceasefire in December. </p> <p>The killings have damaged relations between the governing Popular party, under Jose Maria Aznar, in Madrid and the Basque regional government. The regional and national leaders disagree about the breakdown of last year's abortive peace talks. </p> <p>The victim of yesterday's first attack was identified as Jose Maria Korta. He was killed outside his machine tool factory in Zumaia, near San Sebastian, when a device packed into another car was triggered as he parked his vehicle alongside. </p> <p>Married with three children, Korta was the president of an association of local businessmen and an outspoken critic of ETA. Businessmen in the Basque region are regularly threatened if they fail to pay \"revolutionary taxes\" to ETA and have often been targeted for assassination. </p> <p>Forensic experts in Bilbao spent yesterday examining the wreckage left after a car carrying four ETA activists disintegrated in an explosion on Monday night. The car was said by police to have been carrying up to 30kg (66lb) of explosives which were accidentally detonated. </p> <p>Initially three people were believed to have died but it was later confirmed that there was a fourth victim. Officers had difficulty identifying the bodies because of the force of the blast. </p> <p>Among those thought to have died was one of ETA's most wanted commanders, Patxi Rementeria, the leader of the Vizcaya commando, one of the group's most active units, and was suspected of taking part in the 1997 kidnapping and murder of the Basque politician Miguel Angel Blanco whose death brought 6m Spaniards on to the streets in protest. </p> <p>The conservative Popular party said the ETA members' deaths had averted another attack. But Basque regional political leaders lamented the loss of life and urged that dialogue be reopened. </p> <p>ETA called a ceasefire in September 1998, but the peace process ended in failure after just one negotiating session with the government in 1999. ETA called off its ceasefire in early December. </p> <p>The government offered to move prisoners back to jails nearer home, but refused to concede any more ground on the issue of Basque self-determination, which it fears will lead to Spain's fragmentation. </p> <p>The Basque regional government already has considerable autonomy: tax-raising powers, use of the Basque language in schools, and its own police force. It is run by the Basque National party. </p> <p>ETA's political wing, Herri Batasuna, has seen its political support waning - ETA called for a boycott of the general election in March. The organisation, which used to copy IRA techniques and follow Sinn Fein's political progress in Northern Ireland assiduously, has fallen under the control of hardline factions. </p> <p>One of the organisation's dominant strategists is thought to be Soledad Iparaguirre, whose boyfriend was killed by the security forces in 1981. </p> <p>The Basque National party, which persuaded ETA to call a ceasefire, cut its links with Herri Batasuna after the killings resumed. The separatists have been blamed for nearly 800 deaths since they began their campaign in 1968. </p> <p> Following is a chronology of the main events of the campaign by the Basque separatist group ETA for independence from Spain.

  "The right has been mobilising around rights. Tory MPs and their allies in the Murdoch and Conrad Black newspapers are working up a head of steam about the Human Rights Act. To them it is mainly a stick with which to beat Europe, as if the \"fundamental charter\" now being discussed inside the European Union had anything to do with the implementation of the HRA, two years after it was enacted amid silence on Tory benches and a year after it peacefully came into force in Scotland. <p>To their gallery of stock villains, the Tories were this week delighted to add Caesar's wife - triply stained as a lawyer, an enthusiast for the statute and, unpardonable sin on the right, a woman with political views possibly different from her spouse's. In sum, the Tory position on the new human rights law is a farrago of tabloid headlines and plain ignorance - manifest in the continuing confusion between the European Court of Justice (Luxembourg, part of the EU) and the European Court of Human Rights (Strasbourg, under the Council of Europe). </p> <p>This is a pity. For legitimate questions can be asked about the act and the case made for it by Cherie Booth QC. A sharper opposition might have picked up her argument that human rights can be confined to tried and trusted terrain: race, employment, the behaviour of the police and public authorities. Why should her \"new rights culture\" stop there? Perhaps Mrs Blair knows that a third way government is none too keen on positive rights, to employment, minimum standards of welfare or health. It might have to spend more than even generous Gordon has allowed. </p> <p>Human rights are often couched in individualist, anti-collective terms, which is another reason why Tory opposition to the act is so puzzling. People are to be protected against misuse of power by police and other agents of the state. But other rights contained in the act, to privacy, against racial or gender discrimination, will need to be policed; government will have to be strong in order to enforce them. Ms Booth cited, for example, litigation under the act requiring the state to protect demonstrators from attack. A careful line will have to be followed by courts and legislators if the rights culture is not to become a charter for selfishness, nimbyism and weak government. She is absolutely right to say that there is an ideological and party political dimension to all this. </p> <p>Ms Booth belongs to swish new lawyers' chambers which by all accounts will be kept busy as the thing beds down. The \"learning curve\" - Lord Chief Justice Woolf's phrase - may last a long time. But there will be no bonanza for lawyers while legal aid is so tightly laced. The quid pro quo for any increased state support for litigation has to be further reform of the professional training and practices of the lawyers. As long as the Law Society is dilatory at handling complaints against solicitors; as long as senior judicial appointments are a private mystery for Lord Irvine and his cronies; as long as bar promotions lack transparency, the most dramatic effects of the Human Rights Act ought to be felt in the courts themselves. </p> <p>The Tories are running a risk with this campaign. To claim, as they do implicitly, that Lord Bingham and his colleagues in horsehair are agents of subversion is strange, to say the least, for the would-be party of law and order. To say, as they do explicitly, that the focus the act will put on the rights of individuals against the state is constitutionally destabilising sounds distinctly odd coming from the relicts of Margaret Thatcher.</p>",
  "<p>The Conservatives last night intensified their \"Lady Macbeth\" attack on Cherie Blair and objected to her public defence of the new Human Rights Act on the grounds that her law firm stands to make millions of pounds from cases the act provokes. </p> <p>Far from backing down in the face of accusations of misogyny, officials at party headquarters in London stood by the attack - and said there was no question of William Hague reproaching its author. </p> <p>\"This is a significant issue,\" said one Hague aide. But party officials took their cue from Conservative newspapers which dislike the prospect of the European convention on human rights being used in British courts from October 2. </p> <p>In a personalised attack, which caused offence beyond the Labour ranks, the junior shadow home affairs spokesman, John Bercow, likened the prime minister's wife to Hillary Clinton - a radical, feminist lawyer who planned a political career after years of \"unaccountable\" power behind the scenes. </p> <p>British voters would not tolerate \"an unaccountable cross between First Lady and Lady Macbeth\", said Mr Bercow, 37, MP for Buckingham and an energetic backbench rottweiler. </p> <p>\"Take him with you,\" one MP called when Speaker Betty Boothroyd announced her retirement. Yesterday he was attacked by one of Labour's own guard dogs, Fraser Kemp, the MP for Houghton and Washington, who predicted that \"millions of working women\" would be insulted. </p> <p>\"It is significant that this unpleasant and unwarranted attack comes on the day when we have a leaked report from the Tories themselves, saying that they are anti-family and anti-women,\" said Mr Kemp. \"The bottom line is they simply don't like the idea of working women.\" </p> <p>Amid more complaints about the Blairs' income and current free holiday in Italy and France, some solidarity was shown by Fiona Buxton, author of a pamphlet on women in politics for the Tory think tank, the Bow Group. </p> <p>Conceding that voters would be interested in \"much more important issues\", Ms Buxton said of Ms Booth - as Mrs Blair is known professionally: \"I think it is really unrealistic to expect that she will not pursue her political ambitions or political interests in some way. I think she is not a good target.\" </p> <p>In a co-authored article, Ms Booth argued in the Daily Telegraph that human rights legislation underpinned \"the belief that all human beings are equal\". </p> <p>Ms Booth, a QC at 40, warned judges not to countenance unwarranted claims. Her critics, who surfaced in the Daily Mail, Times and Telegraph, argued that the law firm she helped found, Matrix, will specialise in such rights litigation - and make huge sums from it. </p> <p>Mr Bercow again complained of \"noises off\" from Ms Booth on a range of policies, including her decision to chair a fringe meeting at Labour's conference on the government's record on women's issues. </p> <p>\"These are deeply contentious areas of public policy,\" he said. \"By convention, prime ministers' spouses do not intervene in public debate. It would be helpful if she would respect that long-standing convention.\" </p> <p>Ms Booth, already an employment law specialist, a field not hit by the government's legal aid cuts, was said to make up to \u00a3200,000 a year before her husband's job - and new baby - cut her earnings.</p>",
  "The parents of Sarah Payne are soon to meet Home Office ministers to urge them to introduce a public register of sex offenders. This seems almost unbearably reasonable of the Payne family. If I thought that a convicted sex offender had brutally murdered my eight-year-old, I wouldn't rest at public notification. I'd want them all chopped up into little pieces, starting at the extremities, and in full knowledge of what was happening. I'd want painful and certain death. There wouldn't be a glimmer of forgiveness. <p>I consider that a pretty healthy reaction to elephantine grief. But I would not consider it a proper response if Home Office ministers took account of my fresh, raw, enormous emotions. Legislation should not be enacted because we feel sad or mad, but because it furthers justice - because it will lead to a more fail-proof, just and equitable legal system. </p> <p>The Paynes are not the only people whose impassioned views are being sought. Earlier this year, the lord chief justice promised to let James Bulger's parents have a say in the fate of their son's teenage killers. Lord Woolf declared that their views would inform his final decision on how long Robert Thompson and Jon Venables should serve. </p> <p>But there is a bigger agenda here beyond the rare cases of murdered children. Within a month of announcing that he would consult the Bulger family, Lord Woolf expanded his commitment to involve the victims' families in the review of all 140 sentences of juvenile offenders detained indefinitely. </p> <p>This urge to take account of the feelings of those who have suffered, lies behind much new and proposed legislation. Last month the home secretary told an assembly of Labour lawyers: \"Too often the victim feels that their needs and opinions have been ignored or relegated to a distant second place at key stages in the process.\" This week Jack Straw reiterated: \"I want victims to feel that they are at the heart of the criminal justice system.\" </p> <p> An equitable criminal justice system, however, should not put anyone at its heart - neither the complainant nor the defendant - but should be heartless. If any juror is found to have any interest or knowledge of any of the parties involved in a case, he or she is quite rightly dismissed. The wigs that judges wear depersonalise them, emphasising their role as detached assessors able to deliver unprejudiced opinion. Impartiality is what a fair trial is all about. </p> <p>Victims are not voiceless. Measures are already being implemented to make sure they are heard. A \"victim personal statement\" scheme is to be introduced early next year to \"give victims a greater say in the criminal justice system\". Modelled on the American system of \"impact statements\", this will enable victims to record the effect the crime has had on them, in a statement closely resembling that provided by witnesses. The statement will be taken into account by the police, crown prosecution service and the court. </p> <p>The introduction of this scheme is to be broadly welcomed. It is clear that within such a system, if well regulated and checked, the Bulger and Payne families, among others, could have an input in the course of a trial. </p> <p>But in their drive for a \"victim-led\" criminal justice system, the government is not content to rest there. Just this week it was announced that, from next month, men accused of rape will no longer be allowed to cross-examine the alleged victim, a stark exception to the established right of defendants to defend themselves. In order to give a voice to the victim, the accused is being summarily silenced. </p> <p>There are many other proposals under consideration for increasing \"victim involvement\". These include clearing the public gallery when witnesses and complainants are likely to be distressed by the defendant's supporters. (The fact that a complainant's supporters could just as easily intimidate a defendant does not seem to be countenanced.) Giving victims legal aid for their own representation independent of, but in addition to, the prosecutor, is also being investigated. A victims' charter is to be introduced. </p> <p>One unexpected voice of reason in this rush to right so many wrongs was heard this weekend. The Bishop of Dorking, who will preside over Sarah Payne's memorial service, advised against allowing our hearts to rule our heads. He warned that rash decisions on public policy should not be made so close to the crime. The Paynes may feel that a so-called \"Sarah's law\" is what is needed just weeks after their daughter's murder, but neither we nor they can truly tell what they will feel like in months, or years. Perhaps then, they will have very different views on what should happen to convicted sex offenders. Should victims be consulted by government on a regular basis? Should ministers adjust the law according to the immediacy of their grief? </p> <p>One tabloid newspaper called Sara and Michael Paynes' \"the only voice that counts\". But all of our voices should be heard, not only those in the throes of immeasurable pain, and not only those who have suffered. We do not need a \"victim-led\" criminal justice system. We need a fair and impartial one. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "A cross the last half century, Barbara Kahan, who has died aged 80, had a decisive influence on local authority children's departments and their successors, the all-purpose social services departments. She also played a seminal role in the chequered story of residential care for children and young people, and, in 1991, with Allan Levy QC, published The Pindown Experience And The Protection of Children. <p>Barbara chaired the Nat- ional Children's Bureau from 1985 to 1994, was director of the Gatsby educational project from 1980-91, and was a member of the 1969-73 Finer committee on one-parent families. She had an unwavering faith in children, their potential, and in the need for first-class services to care for them. </p> <p>Her report with Levy was the fruit of their investigation into so-called \"pindown\" abuse at four children's homes in Staffordshire between 1983 and 1989. Under the regime, which was later ruled illegal, more than 150 youngsters, some as young as nine, were isolated in a bare room, wearing only nightclothes, for periods ranging from one day to nearly three months. </p> <p>Labelled \"brilliant and exhaustive\" by the local MP, Mark Fisher, Kahan and Levy's report focused on the neglect of residential care by management, which had allowed the abuse to flourish. It also led to a series of government inquiries into residential care, which have culminated in current initiatives, like Quality Protects, aimed at transforming children's services. </p> <p>Barbara was born the daughter of a railwayman in Horsted Keynes, West Sussex. It was a Methodist and Labour-party supporting home that revered books; her grandfather (also a railway man) read to her everything from fairy tales to The Pilgrim's Progress and the Bible. With her mother, she participated in good works - including the workhouse Christmas pantomime - and she never forgot the plight of strikers and their families during the 1926 general strike. In the 1930s, at Barbara's prompting, a refugee Jewish girl went to stay with the family, and became Barbara's \"foster sister\". </p> <p>In 1939, Barbara won a scholarship to Cambridge. She graduated in English and took a social science course at the London School of Economics (then in wartime exile in the town). While at Cambridge, she helped re-start the university Labour club, worked for Richard Acland's leftist Commonwealth party, which flourished during the second world war, and joined the Peace Pledge Union. </p> <p>After working from 1943 to 1948 as a factory inspector, Barbara became a children's officer in Dudley, from 1948 to 1950. She then moved in Oxfordshire, where she remained until the children's department was absorbed into the department of social services in 1970. Children's officers were a remarkable group of (mainly) women, who, against institutional odds, pioneered a service which proved to be one of the most far-reaching social reforms of the immediate postwar years. </p> <p>Bliss it was to have been alive when the children's departments were created, and Barbara could also savour the very heaven of being so young an appointee. But the beginnings were unpropitious. She had one room and piles of public assistance files. After six weeks, she was permitted to appoint a 17-year-old secretary. She shouldered a caseload of her own, as well as managerial responsibilities. Nor was she past taking a child home for the night when no other place could be found. </p> <p>She was certainly an innovator. In Dudley, she opened the local authority's first children's home. In Oxfordshire, corporal punishment in homes was abolished in 1951, and imaginative fostering was introduced - 40 years ago, special rates were paid as an incentive for people to take difficult children. Preventive work was the cornerstone of childcare policy, staffing ratios were high, and there was close liaison with families. </p> <p>Barbara believed that young people in trouble needed help not punishment, and that the distinction between deprived young people and young offenders was artificial. Both in her Oxfordshire work and in her extra-mural activities, with bodies like the Association of Children's Officers (of which she was president in 1964), she helped pave the way for the 1969 Children And Young Persons Act, which regarded young people in trouble as deprived, not depraved. It was partly what a colleague called her \"obsessional antagonism\" to approved schools that helped bring about their abolition. </p> <p>Barbara always sought to unite children with their families whenever possible; this was remarkable at a time when the axiom was to sepa rate a child from its \"bad\" family background. Her practice was strongly influenced by the child-rearing theories of George Lyward, David Wills, John Bowlby, Donald Winnicott, and her own husband, the child psychiatrist Vladimir Kahan, whom she married in 1955. </p> <p>Barbara was not always the easiest of employers, but she was a nurturer of talent. Many academics and directors of social services could thank her for the start and encouragement they received in Oxfordshire. A vocal advocate of social services departments, she came to regret that their generic approach squandered the specialist skills built up in children's departments. Sadly, she never became director of social services in Oxfordshire; fighting her corner had left her with too many enemies. </p> <p>From 1970 to 1971, she was deputy chief inspector of the children's department at the Home Office. In 1971, she moved to the Department of Health and Social Security as assistant director of the social work service, where she remained until 1980. </p> <p> Barbara remained a proponent of residential care for children long after this approach had gone out of fashion; her belief was that it foundered for lack of advocates among directors of social services. This view was perhaps a necessary corrective to the disfavour in which residential care found itself with both statutory and voluntary agencies. Her most concrete memorial will be her work on \"distance learning\" for the professional group she regarded as the most neglected - residential childcare workers. </p> <p>She had discovered the idea in Canada. Thus it was, in 1980, that she became the Gatsby Project's director, and only staff member. The ideas it promoted were ones she had long cherished - recognising the specialist skills of residential staff, raising their status and expanding their training. In 1991, the project was absorbed into the Open University. </p> <p>It was an irony for so powerful an advocate of residential care as Barbara that, in recent years, she was employed as an expert witness for solicitors representing those who had been abused in the very system of care she had so long supported. Among her publications there was Growing Up In Care (1979), a pioneering work in allowing young people to give their views. </p> <p>From 1983-1990, Barbara was professional adviser to the House of Commons select committee on social services. Among her many other appointments was that of vice-president of the National Children's Bureau, for the last six years, and a life fellowship of the National Institute For Social Work. </p> <p>Barbara enjoyed good food, wine, gossip, argument and books, and was an accomplished amateur musician. She maintained that her husband had been the making of her culturally. With his death in 1981, something went out of her life, which she attempted to fill with an almost desperate hunger for work. While she never suffered fools gladly, and often exhibited little patience with those whom she perceived to be her intellectual inferiors, for her friends she was delightful, amusing and stimulating. </p> <p>\"The trouble with her,\" an Oxford councillor once complained of Barbara, \"is that she is always on the side of the children.\" There could be no greater praise. </p> <p>\u0095 Barbara Joan Kahan, social worker, born March 18 1920; died August 6 2000</p>",
  "<p>It was the grand project. A stylish plan which would bring Britain closer to the European mainland and attract millions of free-spending continentals to British shores. And the best thing about the Channel tunnel, Margaret Thatcher trumpeted from the rooftops, was that it would not cost the British taxpayer a penny. </p> <p>Its inauguration was suitably impressive. The Queen stood alongside French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in 1994 and wished Eurostar all the best. Champagne corks popped and French, Belgian and British officials fell over themselves to slap each other on the back. Six years later it has captured almost two-thirds of market share on the busy London-Paris route and just under half of passenger traffic between London and Brussels. </p> <p>Despite its symbol as a triumph of post-war cooperation between European states, Eurostar is being undone by the travelling habits of tourists and the ebb and flow of the money markets. </p> <p>A survey by the Guardian found that British Eurostar travellers pay nearly 30% more than their European counterparts for comparable journeys between Brussels and Paris and are heavily subsidising the group's less popular Brussels route. </p> <p>In a comparative price study which reinforces the claim that Britons are often charged over the odds, the Guardian found that a \"standard flexi return\" at \u00a3270 costs 27% more to buy in London than in Brussels, where it is just \u00a3198. </p> <p>The most glaring disparity, however, is in the cost of a weekend day return which at \u00a370 costs 34% more in Britain than in Belgium where it is just \u00a346, a fact that will hit travellers hard when a promotional offer expires next month. </p> <p>On average, British passengers have to pay 21% more for their tickets to Brussels than people who want to do it the other way round, and 11% more for their tickets to Paris. </p> <p>\"The key problem that Eurostar has with its ticketing policy is that Brits like going to France and Belgium but the French and the Belgians are less keen to come here because it's expensive. They have to price to those levels to get bums on seats,\" Phil Evans, a senior policy adviser at the Consumers' Association, said. \"It's price discrimination in the single market and should not be allowed.\" </p> <p>The European commission, which polices the single market, is unlikely to act. \"Unless it is the result of a cartel or an abuse of monopoly power there is not much the commission can do about it,\" a spokesman said. </p> <p>The only answer then, according to Mr Evans, is to shop around and see if there are any special offers available, or even try phoning Eurostar in Belgium and France to order tickets from that end. </p> <p>Eurostar has 21 different fare combinations on its London-Brussels route. Nineteen of these are more expensive than the Belgian equivalent, with differences varying from 11.5% to 34%. The situation on the popular London-Paris route is slightly better. Out of 23 fare combinations, 15 are dearer than their French equivalent, with the differences varying from 21% to 4%. </p> <p>Eurostar admits that there are differences in ticket prices but nevertheless insists that it is not ripping off British travellers. \"The markets have got a bit adrift,\" Eurostar spokesman Roger Harrison acknowledged, \"but we can't ask the Belgians to pay a bit more because of the strength of the pound - which has steadily increased.\" </p> <p>Eurostar has been making a loss since it started operating at the end of 1994, but its chief executive Dave Azema predicted this month that it would break even by 2003 or 2004. It is thought to have lost \u00a380m last year and \u00a395m the year before. </p> <p>On its website it claims to offer \"value for money\" fares and has recently started selling tickets over the internet. A price list is conspicuously absent, however, so it is not possible to compare the cost of tickets in Britain, Belgium and France. </p> <p>It is no cheaper to buy a ticket on the net, despite the customer having to proces his or her own order. The company argues that French law prevents it from discounting tickets in France, and claims that it would be too complicated to have a separate policy for Britain. Controversially, the setting of prices is a collective exercise and because the group is a three-way venture between French railways, Belgian railways and Eurostar UK, officials in Paris and Brussels have a say over how much British travellers should pay. </p> <p>The extent of Eurostar's accumulated losses are a closely guarded secret but it is known that the vast majority of its ticket sales are for its London-Paris route. </p> <p>Eurostar rejects accusations that it is using British travellers to subsidise the Brussels route, however, and claims to offer good weekend deals for Londoners to both Brussels and Paris. </p> <p>\"We don't accept any argument about subsidy. That is not a premise we recognise. We still give very good value packages for Brits,\" the company said. </p> <p>The fact remains that Eurostar is still more popular with the British. Surprisingly, though, the British division of Eurostar, which is owned by British Airways and National Express among others, is thought to account for most of the group's losses. </p> <p><strong>Fare differences:</strong></p> <p><strong> Standard Flexi</strong> rtn to Brussels \u00a3270 (London) \u00a3198 (Brussels) </p> <p><strong> Business</strong> rtn to Brussels \u00a3350 (London) \u00a3290 (Brussels) </p> <p><strong> Weekender</strong> rtn to Brussels \u00a3200 (London) \u00a3153 (Brussels) </p> <p><strong> Leisure Flexi </strong> rtn to Brussels \u00a3140 (London) \u00a3107 (Brussels) </p> <p><strong> Weekend </strong> day rtn to Brussels \u00a370 (London) \u00a346 (Brussels) </p> <p><strong> Child</strong> rtn to Brussels \u00a358 (London) \u00a346 (Brussels) </p> <p><strong> Standard Flexi</strong> rtn to Paris \u00a3270 (London) \u00a3240 (Paris) </p> <p><strong> Business</strong> rtn to Paris \u00a3350 (London) \u00a3320 (Paris) </p> <p>Information: Guardian survey</p>",
  "It would be really quite difficult to dream up a political issue that better suited the agenda of the Conservative newspapers and the Tory party in this country than a \"story\" that somehow managed to bring together the subject of human rights and the person of Cherie Booth QC. <p>This one has got everything that Conservative opinion in Britain most detests: a rich, powerful, clever, successful, working mother with a professional commitment to enforcing the new Human Rights Act as enshrined in legislation carried through parliament by - of all things - her husband's government. </p> <p>Conservative opinion does not like human rights much. It isn't quite in tune with the subject, which can be about all sorts of uncomfortable issues for Conservatives - such as equality under the law for homosexuals, or being treated fairly at work whatever your race or gender, or being dealt with equally by the police irrespective of the colour of your skin or your social cachet. </p> <p>And if all that isn't bad enough, Conservative opinion must be additionally suspicious about the new Human Rights Act, not only because it has been introduced by a Labour administration with what is now perceived as a hidden socialist agenda, but because the dreaded word \"Europe\" is hovering around there in the background. The new law is an enactment within British legislation of the European Convention on Human Rights and, without actually pausing to consider what is implied by this, Conservative opinion is wholly against the very notion of enforcing anything that may have been suggested by anything European. </p> <p>Yet all of this high principle and low politics is as nothing compared with Conservative opinion about the prime minister's wife. She is one of the leading human rights lawyers in Britain. She is recognised as such, paid as such and has been professionally honoured as such by being given silk. She has decided to establish a new set of chambers planned specifically to handle the human rights cases predicted in consequence of the implentation of the new human rights law, which comes into force on October 2. </p> <p>This seems a wholly pragmatic and businesslike attitude for a professional woman such as Ms Booth to have adopted. As well as being a forceful advocate, it is the kind of approach which must have got her to the top of her profession. I don't know Ms Booth myself, I have never spoken to her and, as it happens, I have my reservations about lawyers and the way they make their money. But I do believe in human rights. I think they should be laid down by law and enforced and that this exercise therefore seems to be the acceptable face of legal profiteering. Had I not known the Conservative party better I might even have imagined - silly me - that Conservative opinion would applaud such enterprise and initiative and money-making potential. Isn't that what Conservatives do all the time? Isn't that what they're for ? </p> <p>Yet Conservative opinion has leapt upon Ms Booth, unleashing the most extraordinarily venomous attacks upon her. The Tories were given their cue by their newly appointed home affairs spokesman, one John Bercow, a young man of 37 of whom it has been said that only his hair is parted in the centre. In what ranks as a typically outspoken outburst, he suggested that Cherie Booth was a cross between Lady Macbeth and Hillary Clinton and opined that it would be \"helpful\" if she would observe the convention by which those married to prime ministers do not push their own political agendas upon the populace. </p> <p> What convention? Some prime ministers' spouses choose not to work, but few of them deny themselves the opportunity to express themselves. Denis Thatcher pushed his political agenda at every opportunity. He did not speak in public. He did not air his views. But he continued making money and privately telling people exactly what he thought about everything that was going on in politics. Cherie Booth is a working woman. She has, against all difficulties -including every middle-aged working woman's nightmare, an unexpected late pregnancy - managed to continue to operate efficiently and independently. She has represented individuals in court in cases specifically brought against her husband's government - for example in challenging British opposition to European law. </p> <p>What Mr Bercow is saying in reality, of course, is that women shouldn't work, that Cherie's place is back at home with the baby, being supportive of her husband and helping the teenagers with their homework. It is an absurd argument, but in order to try to convey some potency to his outdated ideas, he then ludicrously couples the names of Lady Macbeth and Hillary Clinton as appropriate independent-minded wives whom he apparently thinks might serve to frighten the voters - and get his name in the newspapers. </p> <p>It is only with reluctance that I mention Mr Bercow, whom I do know slightly. He is a very assertive rightwing Conservative with a style which is widely prevalent in today's Tory party. Before becoming an MP in 1997 he was a lobbyist. He is also a former member and secretary of the Monday Club, and it is hard to imagine why anyone in public life should take lessons in human rights from a former secretary of the immigration and repatriation committee of that offensive and unpleasant organisation. He has said recently, upon his appointment to the front bench by William Hague, that his membership of the Monday Club was a long time ago, he was very young and it didn't last long. He was indeed only 18 when he became the club's secretary, he was only - only ! - secretary of the immigration and repatriation committee for a year but he still managed to put in three years' membership of the Monday Club. He resigned in the same year as he became chairman of the Essex University Conservative Association. </p> <p>The obnoxious Mr Bercow - he doesn't like his name pronounced to rhyme with \"cow\" incidentally, but prefers it to chime with \"low\" - has to be heeded, however, because his comments have sparked the debate. The Daily Telegraph launched it, shrewdly recognising what an apparently innocuous article by Ms Booth and a fellow barrister from her new chambers about the changes that we might expect as a result of the Human Rights Act would say to Conservative opinion. Mr Bercow then plunged in and before anyone can say \"human rights?\" a woman Conservative parliamentary candidate is pontificating to the World at One about the outrageous possibility that Cherie Booth might benefit financially as a direct result of legislation introduced by her husband. All this on a day when a leaked internal Conservative report suggests that perhaps the Conservative party is in danger of being out of touch with the electorate on women's issues.</p>",
  "\u0095 Chris McGreal is right that the seizure of 3,041 of Zimbabwe's 4,200 commercial farms will have severe economic consequences for Zimbabwe and its commercial farmers (Down on the farm, August 7). But he should also have mentioned farmworkers and their dependants. <p> </p> <p>Commercial agriculture provides Zimbabwe with 18% of its GDP and 40% of its exports and employs 26% of the workforce. The knock-on effects of the farm-seizures are being felt throughout the economy. With South Africa's businessmen only too happy to buy bankrupt parts of its economy for a knockdown price, Zimbabwe is more likely to become an economic colony of South Africa than a pastoral idyll of small but profitable farms. </p> <p>But the accelerated land reform programme, whose outlines are extremely unclear, is also likely in its present form - unplanned, contradictory and barely financed - to be disastrous to the landless poor, its supposed beneficiaries. Land reform must be well-planned and supported not just by the provision of infrastructure and technical expertise, but also by being part of a well-planned agrarian transformation programme, against the background of a stable economy. </p> <p>The landless and rural smallholders need policy commitments to greater security of tenure to provide not just land, but a process of transferring power from the state to the poor, particularly poor women. Otherwise markets, as sites of unequal power, and political relations will act to marginalise those who cannot participate. </p> <p>There also needs to be an intermediate layer of devel opment-oriented institutions such as credit unions, savings or loan associations, marketing cooperatives, water users' associations and the like. </p> <p>Land reform needs to be driven by the poor to be successful, not by the state alone. It is unlikely that the present chaotic process, driven by Zanu-PF as a means of rewarding its most loyal supporters, will see an increase in smallholder production. Certainly there will not be enough to recoup the income and opportunities lost with the commercial farms. </p> <p>The tragedy is that land reform could have taken place in the 1980s but internal indifference and corruption, plus suspicious funders who reneged on promised money, ensured it did not happen. <br> <b>Dr Steve Kibble</b><br>Catholic Institute for International Relations </p>",
  "\u0095 I was sitting at the same table in the library of the House of Commons when John Bercow MP was penning his pathetic but poisonous attack on Cherie Blair (PM's wife under fire from Tories, August 8). <p>When I asked him what he was doing there he was acutely embarrassed, which at least shows that the little fella is capable of shame. </p> <p>His assertion that there is a long-standing convention that the wives and husbands of prime ministers do not push their own political agenda is a figment of his imagination. </p> <p>I seem to remember that Denis Thatcher bumbled his way through politics and that Norma Major raised the profile of the arts and was instrumental in part in persuading her husband to provide more resources. </p> <p>As for the Queen, she is not, as Bercow suggests, the first lady but the head of state, ie first among men as well as women. </p> <p>Keep up the good work, Cherie. You've certainly rattled them in relation to the new European law on human rights. <br><b>Brian Sedgemore MP </b><br> House of Commons </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 If Tony Blair really believes that Cherie will win women's votes for him, he is even more ignorant of the needs of women than I realised. She is completely out-of-touch with the \"ordinary\" women to whom Cristina Odone refers (Cherie the women's champ, G2, August 8). </p> <p>Cherie certainly is a \"professional high-flier, wife and mother all rolled into one\", but this is because she earns enough money to buy in support for her family responsibilities. Most \"high-flying\" graduates, male and female, don't earn anywhere like her salary, especially if they have chosen careers in the public sector or academia. </p> <p>Cristina Odone feels that Cherie will appeal to feminists because she persuaded Tony to take paternity leave. Yet we all know that she could easily have afforded several nannies to help her at that time. And to distract the prime minister as she did gave the impression that she cared little for the general welfare of the country. </p> <p>It also showed how out-of-touch she is with the pressures on households today. Most men are too worried about short-term contracts, early redundancies and cuts in salaries to fight for paternity leave. </p> <p>We are expected to warm towards Cherie because she had a modest background in a broken home, is a bit \"naff\" and has a \"difficult son\". But where was Cherie when her son needed her most? </p> <p>Give me Hillary Clinton any day. </p> <p><b>Nest Adams </b><br>Prenton,<br>Merseyside <br><a href=\"mailto:Nest@xef6.demon.co.uk\">Nest@xef6.demon.co.uk</a></p> <p> \u0095 So it's back to the kitchen, Cherie, where you belong. <br><b>Chris Young</b><br>Bebington,<br> Wirral <br><a href=\"mailto:young@art-cp.fsnet.co.uk\">young@art-cp.fsnet.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Vladimir Putin's minders were horror-stuck recently when their boss was floored during a visit to Japan. The combative Russian president's showpiece bout with a Japanese judo wrestler left him on the rug in his shirt and tie. <p>\"I wasn't expecting this. It wasn't necessary,\" said Yevgeny Murov, Mr Putin's chief bodyguard. \"The health of the president is the health of the nation.\" </p> <p>It was a rare fall for the surefooted president. In the months since Boris Yeltsin stunned Russia and the world by naming the obscure Mr Putin as his new prime minister, a year ago today, and declaring that he should be the next president, the Russian leader has ushered in a quiet revolution where mishaps have been only of the carefully staged variety. </p> <p>As Mr Putin repairs to the Black Sea resort of Sochi for his summer holiday, he is in an unassailable position, only four months after the electorate rubber-stamped the Kremlin's decision and made him president in March. </p> <p>\"Under Putin the Russian state is being renewed and reinvigorated. There's a new respect for government and politics,\" said Mikhail Kozhokin, editor of the influential daily newspaper Izvettia. \"That's his main achievement. He's been a surprise, but he has a strong instinct for politics. He feels what kind of Russia he wants, although he hasn't quite formulated it yet.\" </p> <p>There is a striking discrepancy between perceptions of Mr Putin abroad and how he is viewed at home. While editorial writers in New York, Berlin, or London lambast the \"authoritarianism\" and control freakery of the former career KGB officer, his popularity has soared to 70% among the public. At the elite level, too, he enjoys broad support. \"There is no political opposition,\" said Alexander Oslon, director of the Public Opinion Fund polling organisation. \"Even our focus groups of regional elites and communicators outside Moscow show very favourable results for Putin.\" </p> <p>For the best part of his year in the public eye, Mr Putin did little, with the brutal exception of the war in Chechnya, which critics decry as cynical ruthlessness and admirers hail as proof of steely resolve. </p> <p>But since March he has launched several offensives on a broad front, provoking showdowns with the big vested interests of Mr Yeltsin's Russia and emerging victorious every time. Some say that, tactically, Mr Putin has made too many powerful enemies too quickly, and that scores will be settled at a later stage. But so far, the gamble has paid off. </p> <p>\"Putin's modus operandi is to go strongly on to the attack and then back down a little, offer concessions and compromises,\" said Igor Bunin, of the Centre of Political Technologies thinktank. </p> <p>Mr Putin's quiet revolution entails a radical shift in the way in which Russia is run. All the key instruments of Mr Yeltsin's Russia are either being co-opted or attacked, intimidated or marginalised: the over-powerful governors of the 89 regions, the so-called oligarchs or business magnates who exercised disproportionate influence under Mr Yeltsin, and the media, especially national television. </p> <p>The duma, or lower house of parliament, and the general prosecutor's office, both focal points of opposition to Mr Yeltsin, are already Kremlin toys. The upper house is being stripped of its powers in favour of a new state council headed by Mr Putin and staffed by his appointees. </p> <p><b> New regime</b><br> </p> <p> \"He's dismantling the Yeltsin system of power and creating a new regime,\" said Liliya Shevtsova, of Moscow's Carnegie Centre. \"Under Yeltsin, power was fragmented horizontally across Russia among various interests. Putin is recentralising, consolidating personal power, not that of institutions. His concept does not tolerate alternative centres of gravity.\" </p> <p>Privately, the president's aides are contemptuous of the riotous Yeltsin years. Mr Putin's mission, they say, is to reverse that dysfunctional state, and make Russia \"effective and strong\". </p> <p>\"In 10 years this country has been reduced to complete chaos,\" said a Putin aide. \"The president knows he has two, at most two-and-a-half years of strong support to make the changes he needs before tackling tough decisions which will be unpopular. That's why he is moving so fast.\" </p> <p>The aim is to tame first Chechnya, then the governors, the oligarchs, and so on. </p> <p>The aide conceded that in fashioning his new Russia, Mr Putin might view democracy, market economics and civil liberties not so much as values in themselves but as tools in building a stronger, more successful and cohesive state. \"But how long did it take for Germany, for example, to become a democracy?\" </p> <p>\"Putin believes in democracy as a means to an end, he's a conditional democrat,\" said Sergei Markov, head of the Centre for Political Studies. \"If it helps to make a great Russia, fine. If not, he'll give it up.\" </p> <p>Alongside the dizzying pace of domestic streamlining, coercing loyalty to the Kremlin, Mr Putin has been keeping up a punishing but successful schedule abroad, visiting the Pope, Tony Blair, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, staging a summit with Bill Clinton in Moscow, going to China, North Korea and Japan. There have been no embarrassing Yeltsin-style gaffes on the foreign stage. The performance has been polished, helping Russians to feel better about themselves after a decade of growing resentfulness towards the west. </p> <p>The anti-western novelist Alexander Zinoviev wrote last week that Mr Putin's election was the keynote event of post- Soviet Russia, and that he had the potential to become \"an outstanding president\". </p> <p>Mr Markov says that Mr Putin is constructing a \"limited democracy\", trading some freedoms gained in the Yeltsin era for order and predictability. Television is a case in point. The two national channels, the state ORT and the private NTV, are controlled or owned by rival oligarchs, Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky. Both are under intense Kremlin pressure to surrender control of the networks and toe the political line. The Kremlin is also planning a new network of regional TV and newspapers in the seven super-regions, under new Putin envoys, to dictate its agenda and bypass the regional governors, many of whom control local media. </p> <p><b> Sweeping powers</b><br> </p> <p> Such moves have liberal critics crying foul. Mr Yeltsin's 1993 constitution confers sweeping powers on the president. Mr Putin's moves are increasing those powers and eliminating the checks and balances that existed under Mr Yeltsin. </p> <p>\"It's an elective monarchy, where everything is subordinate to the president, not the law,\" said Ms Shevtsova. </p> <p>An appeal organised by Mr Berezovsky and signed by several prominent public figures yesterday warned of the threat of a new wave of authoritarianism. \"While the president's aim of creating an effective and responsible government is natural and understandable\", the statement declared, \"the main gains of the past decade are under threat: the free press, free entrepreneurship and - the main thing - freedom of thought.\" </p> <p>The signatories included Alexander Yakovlev, the architect of Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost. </p> <p>\"Putin's policies are a cause for concern,\" Ms Shevtsova said. \"But I don't want him to fail, because his successor might be much more totalitarian, aggressive and nationalist.\" </p> <p><b>Bombs and ballots push him to top: Key dates in the Putin era </b><br> </p> <p> \u0095<b> August 9 1999</b> Vladimir Putin is chosen as acting prime minister by President Boris Yeltsin.

  "The former Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim gave a defiant speech from the dock yesterday as he was sentenced to nine years in jail on sodomy charges. <p>Anwar, 53 tomorrow, told a packed court in Kuala Lumpur that he was \"the victim of a political conspiracy through a web of intrigue orchestrated by the maestro, [prime minister] Mahathir Mohamad\". </p> <p>There was a fierce clash as Anwar told the judge that the judgment \"does not disgrace me, it disgraces you, the judiciary and this nation of ours\". Judge Arifin Jaka, who said that the sentence should reflect the \"public interest\", repeatedly tried to silence Anwar and said he was \"a sick man\". He called a recess and stormed off the bench after Anwar retorted that he was \"a sick judge\". </p> <p>Mr Anwar then comforted his wife, Wan Azizah, who has taken over his political role. \"He told me to be strong, not to cry, and to calm the children,\" she said later. Dr Azizah said they would appeal against the verdict but added that \"the result is already known\". </p> <p>More than 500 protesters gathered outside in spite of police warnings that even peaceful demonstrations were forbidden. Tian Chua, a leader of the National Justice party founded by Dr Azizah, was arrested. </p> <p>The judge said Anwar would serve the nine-year term after finishing a a six-year sentence imposed last year for allegedly trying to suppress the charges against him when he was still deputy prime minister. </p> <p>In spite of Anwar's characteristic defiance, he is now effectively removed from the political scene for good. </p> <p>Many Malaysians believe such an outcome had been the prime minister's objective ever since he decided that Anwar, who had been his chosen successor, was becoming a political threat. </p> <p>Within days of Anwar's arrest in 1998, Dr Mahathir claimed to have \"incontrovertible proof\" of the sodomy allegations. Defence lawyers pleaded in vain that the prime minister often committed contempt of court by publicly pronouncing Anwar guilty. </p> <p>Yesterday Judge Arifin dismissed conspiracy claims as \"irrelevant\", and said that the evidence of the key prosecution witness was credible in spite of \"some discrepancies\". </p> <p>Anwar was accused of sodomy by a former family chauffeur, Azizan Abu Bakar, who gave confusing testimony. </p> <p>The prosecution originally said that Anwar committed sodomy in May 1994, but amended that to May 1992 based on the driver's evidence. The defence showed that the building where the sodomy allegedly took place was not built until 1993. Prosecutors then amended the timing to the first three months of 1993. </p> <p>Anwar's adoptive brother, Sukma Darmawan, 39, was found guilty of abetting Anwar. Sukma, who said a confession was forced from him by police, was given a six-year jail sentence and four lashes. Anwar was excused the lashing because of his age. </p> <p>International observers have expressed serious doubts about the integrity of the Malaysian judicial system in the light of Anwar trials. </p> <p>Amnesty International said yesterday that the verdict \"highlights the vulnerability of all Malaysians to selective, politically motivated prosecutions\". Anwar had been brought to trial \"because of his dissenting political activities and the challenge he posed to government leaders\". </p> <p>The US-based Human Rights Watch listed a series of legal irregularities including the severe beating of Anwar while he was in custody, and the attempted coercion of key witnesses - one was threatened with the death penalty for a minor firearms offence. </p> <p>Anwar's chief lawyer, Karpal Singh, faces trial for sedition over statements made in court while defending his client. </p> <p><b>J'accuse My fight for justice <br> Extracts from Anwar's address to the court </b> </p> <p> The pronouncement of your judgment today was a mere formality, according to [the] preordained script of the conspirators. [Dr Mahathir] is a coward who would not take responsibility for his own evil. </p> <p>... I was loyal to the government and the prime minister. But ... if justice, the law or public interest were threatened, I would defy Dr Mahathir. I objected to the use of massive public funds to rescue the failed businesses of his children and cronies. </p> <p>And it was precisely because I defied him ... that I was dismissed and persecuted. This is a small sacrifice to pay in the cause of democracy and justice. </p> <p>This nation needs reform and renewal. To Dr Mahathir and his greedy family and cronies, I say beware the wrath of the people, for the people are rising to reclaim justice.</p>"
